        "review_detailed_main": "Sex. One of the most overused element in cinema and often mis-used and unnecessary. I was concerned when this movie is announced, a mis-used sex scene could make the movie feels cheap.\n\nThis movie did manage to get it quite right.There were scenes of sexual attractions in many parts of the movie but it did not take away all other elements that were done well in the movie.\n\nThematically beautiful, the mansion itself is split half between a western and Japanese. The costume design and cinematography are perfect. The west : grand and luxury; The Japanese : Clean, simple elegant design.\n\nThe story can be summed up as a hero saving a princess and is split into 3 parts. I loved the first two parts, the third part was the only disappointing part where the plot was predictable and not as interesting and it being the last part makes the movie fell short.\n\nThe music is perfect. Just like Old Boy, music is more crucial than other movies. Old Boy is a movie that would make you think of a modernized hero revenge movie that is both realistic and unbelievable. The music have strong presence to help build up that world. Same goes with this movie as it is also a very realistic setting (you know the period of time it is based upon, the characters motives are clear and their actions are) yet with some very unbelievable events when you add everything together.\n\nIt isn't a perfect movie, I saw some editing that could be improved here and there. The last part was also a small disappointment for myself. But it is a damn unique movie that you have to watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Handmaiden\" is a crazily imaginative and beautiful movie by Chan-wook Park, who is at the top of his game in this story of a pickpocket that tries to steal the fortune of a naive, innocent rich woman that has been secluded in a mansion in the middle of nowhere. Of course, things will start to get complicated soon enough.\n\nChan-wook Park has done a great job in adapting the original novel by Sarah Waters, and mixing it with the history of the Japanese invasion of Korea at the beginning of the twentieth century. The plot is a little bit silly sometimes, but Chan-wook Park makes it all tight and fast-paced, and even the most silly moment becomes a moment of beauty and fun. From the first moment, the viewer will be enthralled by the story of these two women and their relationship, and every plot development will just add fun to the whole.\n\nIf the plot and the direction weren't amazing enough, the movie is as beautiful as they come. From the darkest moment, the most violent, to the most intimate, beauty transpires in every frame, and every scene comes to life and threatens to pop and break free from the screen. This is helped by the amazing work of all the cast, who does an incredible job in bringing this tale to life (it could be criticized, though, some of the heavily accented Japanese, for characters that are supposed to be able to pass as them).\n\nAll in all, \"The Handmaiden\" is proof that a movie can have a plot, amazing direction, acting, scenery, craziness and the most beautiful package possible. And even if it is almost two hours and a half long, it feels like a breeze.\n\nYou will fall in love with this movie. Just plain great."

        "review_detailed_main": "The controversial film from Korean master Chan-wook Park evokes the sexiness of Abdellatif Kechiche's \"Blue is the Warmest Colour\" and Park's own signature violence and thrills. Set in the 1930s Japanese occupied Korea, it's a story of a young female pickpocket (Kim Tae-ri) who becomes a handmaiden to a beautiful Japanese heiress (Min-hee Kim). However, she must manage to convince the heiress to marry a conman (Jung-woo Ha) who poses as a count, for which she will get a chance for a better life. She gets into a moral dilemma when she starts developing feelings for the heiress.\n\nThe Handmaiden is a triumph on every level. The film is divided into three chapters, all giving different perspective. This way, the story is perfectly structured to give more and more insight as the film progresses, but at the same time, keep the viewers guessing. It offers a few surprises along the way as well. Visually, it's a feast for the eyes. The term \"every frame a painting\" gets overused, but it really fits here. I'm not only talking about cinematography, which offered plenty of memorable shots and beautiful scenery, but the costume and set design. The three leads all gave terrific performances. Musical score by Yeong-wook evokes, or better said, amplifies the emotions and the suspenseful tone. Despite the run time of 2 hours and 24 minutes, it never gets dull, it's very evenly paced throughout. I couldn't look away for a second.\n\nOne thing needs to be addressed, the film is quite explicit. That being said, it never gets vulgar, the sex scenes are done in perfect taste, they never feel out of place and they're not there just for the sake of it. The relationship between the characters and the physical presentation of it are integral to the film. It's a film about passion, abuse, jealousy, betrayal and deception, but most of all, it's an atypical love story, which will make one love and hate the protagonists at the same time. It's original and daring work of art that will stick with viewers long after it's finished.\n\nWhenever Chan-wook Park makes a film, it must undoubtedly be compared to his masterpiece, \"Oldboy\". I don't think that \"The Handmaiden\" surpasses it, but it comes very close. With this film, he proved himself to be one of the greatest working directors today. It's the best film I've seen this year, one that I can't wait to revisit. It's not to be missed."

        "review_detailed_main": "Not the craziest film content wise, that award goes to The Neon Demon, but definitely the craziest film storytelling wise. Park Chan-Wook's The Handmaiden is almost as good as the film that put him on the map, Oldboy, and brings such ferocity and energy that it will be one of the most unforgettable films of 2016.\n\nThink of The Handmaiden as The Duke of Burgundy F'd Up Edition. This film is pretty twisted in the most unexpected ways from the cinematography that is very reminiscent of Possession in that it always keeps moving, eroticism that is reminiscent of Blue is the Warmest Color, performances as spellbinding as Carol, and the insanity of Park Chan- Wook as expected.\n\nThe cinematography is some of the most entrancing of the year. Shots that look like they came out of The Master. It's shots like these that make me wonder how was this even possible? It looks so damn cool!\n\nThe performances are perfect in sucking you into this world of erotica, selfishness, and trickery. Both female leads were fantastic. Min-hee Kim and Kim Tae-ri are amazing with sharing their sexual tension with the audience watching. It's films like these that are the most memorable. Making you feel how ther characters are feeling. Jung-woo Ha and Jin- woong Jo were great as these sexually and financially repressed men who do the most screwed up things to feel the pleasure they so desire. Nothing wrong with the cast at all.\n\nOf course Park Chank-Wook hits it out of the part with directing. How else would this immaculate vision be done without him niche for detail. He always knows exactly what to do to get an emotion out of his audience and I applaud him for that.\n\nThe only negative is that during the middle briefly the pacing slows down a lot and it became really unbearable because I wanted to know exactly what was going to happen next. Thankfully it doesn't last that long and it's really minor that probably won't affect others viewings.\n\nIf you have any interest in The Handmaiden or you've just heard about it for the first time I strongly suggest checking this out as soon as it comes out. I'll definitely re watch it when it releases in theaters. Easily one of the best films of the year and one I hope to re watch soon."

It's certainly visually and thematically rich and provocative as it slides between frequently explicit romance, comedy and horror: if in part it aims to shock, it certainly does so in style. However, I struggled to like any of the characters, all of whom seem as selfish and ruthless as each other, and felt no especial sympathy for the female leads simply because they happen to fall in love/list for each other. The film should perhaps be seen as a paean to desire, in all its oddness and intensity. But for all the artistry, I never quite escaped the feeling of a tale told by schoolchildren, snickering behind the bikesheds."

        "review_title": "will need a 2nd viewing. I mean that as a compliment (mostly)",
        "review_detailed_main": "The Handmaiden is a film that unfolds with a classic film stylist (in particular I felt like Chanwook Park was in a kind of Brian De Palma mode as far as making an erotic dramatic-thriller with a camera that luxuriates in long shots, elaborate camera movements, and cinematic grammar that emphasizes operatic intentions, though it's maybe not the first time he's done this anyway), and is LOADED with story. What appears to be the story of a handmaiden who is put in as part of a long con by a man who wants to steal this wealthy woman's money is actually a story about storytelling, about weaving a pack of lies and an entire personality and, in reality, how that can start to crack apart when it comes to seeing humanity in another person and their vulnerabilities.\n\nThere's a lot going on in this movie, and there is a lot that is... sordid and over the top in its sexuality. That's intentional, I'm sure, and Park never coddles his audience with what he's showing as far as sexuality; the two main women of the film, the handmaiden and her master/mistress or what have you, end up having an emotional connection and this leads to a sexual one. This has the most graphic lesbian sexuality on screen since Blue is the Warmest Color, but here the rawness is matched by the elegance of Park's direction, and while you get to see much of it, only some of it (but there *is* some) that is gratuitous. Otherwise, this is a story of backstabbing and betrayal, but all of it leading up to being in the larger sense about how people fit in to the circumstances they are in, how they have to not simply play but BECOME the characters they're playing - and how these images flip based on perceptions and how we see the scenes.\n\nHere's where I may become less articulate in my criticism: the film is in three parts, and I forgot about there being 'parts' as I was so into the film during its first part. There is a major betrayal, but then the movie goes into a 'Part 2', and it turns into a different story... a VERY different kind of story, and it is one that left me confused at first, left adrift, and only Park's direction kept me afloat. As Part 2 went on I got into the movie more, though you have to be prepared for scenes from part 1 being repeated - and whether this becomes tedious will vary depending on the viewer. Nothing is ever not gorgeous to look at, and Park is inspired by paintings and art in the real world, and it's completely sumptuous (I'd be rooting for this to win all the costume/production design awards come February), but there comes a point where the filmmakers are showing the 'here's what happened this scene' moments a little too much. I won't reveal why this is done except to say that the characters take on other roles we didn't expect, and their decisions and how they hide parts of their personalities makes for fascinating viewing. Some times.\n\nAnd then it gets to part 3, and the movie goes into being sordid melodrama and not much more. By this time, the filmmakers have to wrap the story up, and show what this man who has been trying to machinate everything for his own ends is met with a nasty fate. Overall there's so much about The Handmaiden to admire, from the performances by Min-hee Kim as Lady Hideko (appearing in part 1 as varieties of cold and distant and then close and warm and terrified in the other parts), Tae-ri Kim (Sookie, who has much to learn about the art of performance, I mean her character not the actress, she's great), and Jung-woo Ha as the 'Count' who has to remain in control for the whole runtime, but gives in to his passions too. And yet I also wonder if a first viewing trying to explain everything how I felt doesn't do the film justice: it moves slower and more languidly than other Park films, so it took longer to get in to, and the themes of conning and performance may be done stronger in any given Quentin Tarantino film (though here done with more taste and intense sexuality - i.e. the scene with the thimball on the tooth).\n\nAnother viewing may give more, or less. I can tell you now it's worth seeing if you love pure CINEMA, the likes of which get made by directors with a passion for the form and expressing stories of early 20th century sexual excess and emotional f***ed-up ness (it is early 20th century Korea with a major Japanese influence - in that way it'd make a solid double feature with Kim Jee-Woon's Age of Shadows). As for whether it's a great film, I'm not so sure."

I enjoyed some scenes, the interaction between actors, but most of them did not feel real so I didn't really take anything from it.\n\nThere are several slow parts where scenes are replayed from a different perspective and it's mostly interesting for the sexual discovery the characters partake. Actually, there is not much to it other than the sex.\n\nIt was okay, different from what I usually watch, but I was expecting something more special, especially after watching such an amazing trailer."

Some of it's chosen exterior locations are so captivating and mesmerizing, you almost feel you're there, or wish you were. The actresses are beautiful and perform nothing short of excellent, the young girl (The Handmaiden) especially, such a professionally acted job. You'd expect more so sex scenes, that kind of left me a little downtrodden. The major lesbian one, amidst only a couple of others, in this near two and half hour piece, is one of the hottest and most explicit, I've ever seen, this one again, beautifully shot. The story involves a young girl, a new handmaiden, forced to defraud the wife of the husband, only the young girl falls for the wife, where the story kind of manipulates you, as to where the girl's intentions will lead, where revenge is thrown in too, as we go back in time to an earlier period, involving our young girl, and the wife, where we find ourselves returning to some old scenes, but with added stuff- purpose here. This is one you'd have to watch a couple of times to get the complete picture. Didn't understand the change in color of the subtitles, my only qualm. Acting by all is top notch, and our handmaiden is definitely something to ogle at. A handmaiden who's beautifully made. We too have some violence, and some humorous moments. Hopefully this film will command more attention from moviegoers in Adelaide, as here's one faultless cinematic experience, you should experience, and by no accounts, miss, as it will be your loss. The most impressive thing here though, above everything else here is the filming/photography from obviously a very talented photographer."

The story and its pace are fairly easy and slow to follow. There is nudity and adult situations (not sure if they are cut in the theatrical release), but that is not something that should be disturbing the viewer at all. If it does, maybe the movie is not something you should watch (or read up on if there is less nudity in the other cut).\n\nHaving concenterated way too much on that aspect (it is what it is as someone recently said in a way worse context), the movie is well told and may reprise certain moments to give the viewer a fuller picture of what he experienced - which overall is a nice thing, but some may find redundant. Park Chan Wook is more than Old Boy, if you are still stuck on that (great movie no doubt), and he more than proves it here"

Do some surface-level research on Japanese annexation of Korea and specifically the infamous 'comfort women'.\n\nCompleted that?

        "review_detailed_main": "Park Chan Wook's adaptation of Sarah Water's historical crime novel is beautiful. This is no surprise as all of Park Chan Wook's films are beautiful. Chung Chung-hoon (Park's cinematographer since Oldboy) has once again delivered one of the more visually stunning films of the year. Vivid colours are used provocatively to invoke a fanciful vision of occupied Korea. What is a relief is that the film contains the compelling characters and deep insight that Park's last film, Stoker, unfortunately lacked.\n\nPark has returned to the theme of female sexuality that he previously explored in Stoker and Thirst, this time focusing on a burgeoning relationship between a young heiress and her handmaiden. However as you'd expect from a work adapted from a crime story, there are a great many twists in the story. What sets this apart from other erotic crime fiction (aside from the technical prowess) is our emotional engagement with the story. This can be attributed to the excellent performances, especially Kim Tae-ri as Sook-Hee who is at times subtly hilarious and deeply heart-breaking. Ha Jung-woo is wonderful as the conman who attempts to manipulate both women.\n\nThere is the same potential problem with this film as Blue is the Warmest Colour, namely that this is a film about female sexuality as written and directed by a man (admittedly in both cases adapted from works by female authors). Just as with that film I feel there is more going on here. The film concerns itself with the excitement of new love and its ability to liberate us from seemingly inescapable circumstances. However with this film, I believe that Park may have anticipated this issue.\n\nOne of the more interesting themes of the film is sexual exploration. At the screening of the film I attended Park Chan-wook mentioned that his fans in Tokyo have nicknamed him the \"intellectual pervert\". As we explore the household of The Handmaiden we realise that some very niche sexual practices are being explored, tantalisingly hinted at by a pair of brass balls found in a drawer early in the film. Around the midpoint of the film we are presented with a room full of men watching a woman tell an erotic story. We see her tell multiple stories involving tentacle beasts, asphyxiation and object sexuality. The men are entranced by this erotic display, whilst the film presents it as a lurid and rather cold affair. The woman is being exploited.\n\nThis is contrasted by the incredibly warm and intimate filming of the love scene between Sook-Hee and Hideko. The scene is actually visited twice during the film from different perspectives. The scene is very erotic and exciting, not least because we know these characters and understand what this experience means to them. I believe we are to contrast these scenes. One is titillation derived from imagined scenarios, the other is the genuine eroticism of seeing two characters we care about connect physically. Yet perhaps we can allow this opportunity to contemplate our voyeurism. Even though we understand their situation better, are the character still being exploited for our benefit?\n\nRelocating the film from Victorian Britain to 1930s Japan has an interesting effect on the story. Whereas the recent film \"When Marnie Was There\" (a studio Ghibli production of an Irish novel) moves the action to Japan with only some aesthetic nods to its original setting, Park uses this as an opportunity to comment on the period and place. The film is set during the Japanese occupation of Korea. Early in the film it is mentioned that Kouzuki, the man who built the house, combined eastern and western traditions. This contrast of designs is evident throughout and creates a dynamic impression of a country transforming.\n\nUltimately this is Park Chan-Wook's most engaging and entertaining film since Thirst. His trademark dark humour, startling violence and kinky eroticism are all in full effect. If some of those elements put off certain people, then that's just all the more reason to cherish the film. I look forward to seeing it again when the film is generally released next year, as I'm sure there is much more to see."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie disappointed me. I knew that coming out of a relatively homophobic country, it probably wouldn't be groundbreaking in that sense, but I still hoped that it would set a good standard for lgbtq movies.\n\nThe plot itself is great. It follows the plot of 'fingersmith' rather closely, except it is set in 1930's Korea. It has many plot twists and strange characters that keep you on your toes.\n\nThe cinematography is also, of course, beautiful. The costumes and sets are magnificent and appealing. It has a great soundtrack and also good acting.\n\nSo why do I give it a 6/10? It mostly has to do with the fetishization of lesbians. The sex scene is ridiculous. They scissor, for chrissakes. No one does that in real life. It is dramatized and obviously panders to a male audience. It does nothing to further the plot. I was incredibly disappointed in this scene. It was a complete waste of 10 minutes (yes, 10 minutes). It watches like porn, the kind made specifically for men.\n\nTo make matters worse, the two female characters are not very fleshed out. They meet, they have sex, now they're in love. There is barely any conversation between the two. The two lead actresses do a superb job of portraying sexual tension, but it is thrown in your face early on. Being gay was not exactly the norm in the 1930's. It's unlikely that two women would act so, well, gay around each other so soon after meeting. That adds to the idea that their relationship is being used for the sex appeal and not for the plot.\n\nYes, this movie is worth watching. But don't go into it expecting an empowering message for lgbtq viewers. They could have done a lot more with the relationship movie, but instead they decided to play it safe, throwing away an accurate representation of a gay relationship. I suppose the world is not ready for a real lesbian movie."

There are three points-of-view, and the film invariably slips out of POV from time to time. That said, the settings, costumes and cinematography. are absolutely gorgeous, as are the female actors. Except for a twist or two, the film goes nowhere and is about nothing. The Korean and Japanese dialogue (as translated) often sounds like a cross between what one would find in a romance novel and hard-core pornography--breathless, over-the-top, no pretense of being remotely realistic. Nevertheless, the reviews have been extremely positive and the people in the audience when I attended seemed really to like this film--I am hard-pressed to understand why. While the characters in the movie are lusting for each other, and making an all-out effort to titillate viewers, I hunger for a story that has character development and a journey worth traveling."

The softness of language in this movie, draws you more into the setting, atmosphere and characters.\n\nOn the other hand, the acting skills shown by all of their actors and actresses are simply flawless and amazing. I don't what is it about these asian actors that they don't overplay nor fall into too much screaming or cheesy acting.

Being divided into 3 parts of lies and betrayals, the film has a huge camera work, abusing well-designed plans and space, both indoors and out, traveling through a mixture of English and Japanese architecture, the film is a breeze in the eyes of so beautiful, from the very accurate track, immersion in the beauty of Japanese erotic literature, the film explores well-developed characters, and of course, returns plot twist on plot twist, as the director knows well how to do, no doubt one of the best films of the year."

Based on Sarah Waters' novel \"Fingersmith,\" this cinematic gem captivates viewers with its lush visuals, compelling characters, and a twisty narrative that keeps you guessing until the very end.\n\nSet in the 1930s during the Japanese occupation of Korea, the story centers on Sook-hee, a young Korean woman hired as a handmaiden to a wealthy Japanese heiress, Lady Izumi. As Sook-hee becomes entwined in the intricate plot devised by a conman aimed at swindling Lady Izumi, the film delves into themes of trust, betrayal, and the complexities of love.\n\n\"The Handmaiden\" is a feast for the eyes. Park Chan-wook's direction is stunning, using rich, vibrant colors and meticulous framing to create a lush, immersive world. The film's cinematography provides a sense of intimacy that enhances the emotional depth of the characters' relationships. Each frame is carefully crafted, making it a true visual masterpiece.\n\nThe performances are outstanding, with Kim Tae-ri delivering a captivating portrayal of Sook-hee, balancing innocence and cunning. Conversely, Kim Min-hee, as Lady Izumi, is both vulnerable and strong, creating a compelling dynamic between the two characters. The depth of their relationship unfolds beautifully, filled with unexpected twists that keep viewers invested in their journey.\n\nThe screenplay is intricately woven, presented in a nonlinear format that expertly reveals different perspectives and layers of the plot. As the story progresses, secrets and hidden motives are unveiled, challenging audience perceptions and expectations. This narrative complexity is one of the film's greatest strengths, inviting repeated viewings to fully appreciate its intricacy.\n\n\"The Handmaiden\" is a captivating exploration of love, deceit, and the power dynamics between its characters.

I can just say that you have probably never seen anything like this.

In an example of narrative sleight of hand that would make Quentin Tarantino proud, director Chan-wook Park tells his story in three parts, each one upending the perspective of the one before and forcing his audience to re-process everything it has just seen.\n\nThe first part tells the story of a young pickpocket, Sook-Hee, who is roped into a scheme concocted by a sleazy thief posing as a rich count to rob a rich heiress, lady Hideko, of her fortune. The second part tells things from the heiress's point of view, and we find out that she and the \"count\" are actually in cahoots and it's Sook-Hee who's the dupe. Then the third part details the efforts of the two women, who have fallen in love, to double cross everyone and escape to make a life together.\n\n\"The Handmaiden\" is largely about what happens when women tire of playing the role assigned to them by men and decide to write their own narrative. Storytelling is a running theme in the film, but the stories being told are all about women being sexually used by men at best but almost always suffering in some way, either physically or emotionally, at their hands. When Sook-Hee and Lady Hideko decide they don't like the parts written for them and take matters into their own hands, it's like watching a weary character in a book jump out of the pages and run away from the reader. The women are liberated, and the viewer likewise feels liberated watching them, enjoying the rare film where women are about more than what men do to them.\n\nGrade: A+"

Here, I have to make an exception. Yes, it does have some fairly graphic lesbian scenes - though not much compared to \"Blue is the Warmest Colour\". And yes, this lesbianism is between two pretty, young Korean actresses.\n\nSupposedly, at least most guys love to see women make out, and most of them also have a preference for Asian women.

But the continuous bombardment of pornography makes it very clear that director Park had no intentions of making a respectable film. Perhaps his intention was to see if he could persuade critics that an overtly explicit work could somehow be considered art rather than pornography? Whatever his motives may be, I now firmly believe that he is a dirtier old man than the dirty old man in his story, and this movie that had so much potential only leaves me feeling dirty too."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have noticed on other occasions that many of the Korean films refuse easy categorizations. This is also the case of 'The Handmaiden', the film made in 2016 by Chan-wook Park. It is a mature film, a film that starts from an English horror-Gothic style novel, moves the action in Korea occupied by Japan in the 30s of the last century, and develops into a synthesis of psychological and erotic thrillers with family saga and social cinema with a strong feminist touch. The personal imprint is very visible, the director that 'Oldboy' made famous in the world manages once again to tell fluently and with a unique visual perfection a Tarantino style story that takes place in a Japanese Hitchcock setting. I think there will be viewers who are bothered by one or the other of the details and scenes in the film, but I don't think many can escape the magnetic charm of the story put on screen by this Korean master. Yes, master. I think that with this film, Chan-wook Park earned - at least for me - the title of master of the art of film.\n\nThe film has four characters moving in a world that feels like a kind of historical pulp fiction, probably a retrospective satire of the Japanization of the Korean high and ascending classes that happened during the colonial period in the early 20th century. They all imitate Japanese behaviour, take Japanese names, aspire to become or at least look Japanese, which was probably the sign and appearance of the social rise of the period. Kouzuki (Jin-woong Cho), a rich old man, owner of a villa whose architecture mixes Victorian and Japanese styles and collector of an impressive library of precious books and lithographs, raises (severely, not to say cruelly) and educates Hideko (Min-hee Kim) the daughter of his late wife's sister who committed suicide years ago. Does he intent to marry her or does he just use her as a refined object of pleasure for the erotic readings served to his male friends? Hideko has a beautiful dowry, which he tries to get his hands on, same as do the young artist who introduces himself as Count Fujiwara (Jung-woo Ha) and the maid Sook-Hee (Tae-ri Kim), in fact a clever pickpocket who becomes the pivot of a chain of intrigues worthy of a saga of a fallen family, with many hundreds of pages devoured by readers. The plans will change several times, same as the viewer's perspective throughout the film, which is divided into three approximately equal in time parts, in which the story is told and repeated from different points of view.\n\nThe narrative technique of alternative perspectives has already been used in the world cinema, including that of the Far East, by master Kurosawa for example. Here it seems to me that a new dimension is being added, because the two storytellers are the young Sook-Hee and Hideko whose connection is constantly evolving and oscillating between a master-maid relationship, solidarity facilitated by the shared destinies of traumatic childhoods marked by the deaths of the mothers, complicity , enmity, rivalry and love. It's one of the most beautiful stories of its kind I've seen on screens lately, and Chan-wook Park demonstrates his mastery of psychological characterization, as well as his ability to transform shocking details of violence and sex into functional elements of action. All four acting performances are perfect. Visually, the film is a delight, at no time is the camera neutral, the most interesting and unusual angles serve the story and each frame is studied and staged with the aesthetic refinement of the Japanese prints. Viewers who a priori reject movies that are too violent or which contain too explicit scenes will probably avoid this film anyway. For those who will see it, however, it will be difficult, I think, not to fall under the spell."

Aiding this scheme is a pretty little pickpocket named Sook-Hee (played with great skill and charm by Tae-ri Kim).\n\nThat's all I can tell you about the plot. Rest assured it is fascinating with some very surprising twists and turns. This is also one of the sexiest movies I've ever seen. It is billed as a crime thriller but actually it is the story of a beautiful love affair.

On the other hand, Kim Taeri, who plays the role of a female pickpocket also shows a decent acting in the movie. Ha Jung-soo, the count, also plays well and become an indispensable part in building the story lines. The plot twist in the movie is quite unexpected, but it's a happy ending so that's good. Last but not least, the cinematography of Park Chan-wook is out of this world, with many picturesque scenes and sets. I hardly watch a movie twice, but for this film, I would definitely want to watch it again."

For the rest, I found the film far too long with all these flashbacks, there is a time when I got lost in the story, so what bothered me the most and without being a prude, It was all these scenes more than erotic and quasi pornographic that irritated me, there was way to make a film simply erotic without being saturated by all these scenes far too daring that for me have spoiled the film, i am sure many have enjoyed these lesbian scenes, if i had wanted to see a porn, i would have tapped a believe me and i saw with the years, so the choice is not that the scenes shocked me in As such, was that they did not have to be so daring, in short, as their opinions are said to each one. I can nevertheless also point out that the actors were very good in their respective roles. In conclusion, a superb realization, beautiful scenery and beautiful pictures, which make me put a 7/10 nevertheless .."

It proves that with lust, and hot unexpected erotic passion that leads to emotions that new life and love is possible for two ladies.\n\nSet in 1930's Korea a young woman Sook-Hee(Tae-Ri Kim)is hired to be a new handmaiden for Lady Hideko(Min-Hee Kim)who's a Japanese heiress who's lives on an estate by the country and the palace is a castle spread like with many books to read and much to learn like the arts which involve hand painting. However it's a secret plot that Sook-Hee has with a con man known as the count and that is to defraud Hideko of her large inheritance.\n\nThru it all the film has visions of doubt, trust, and the elements of love and hot erotic passion is taken into new heights as the emotions brought out with Lady Hideko and Sook-Hee twist this plot and little cat and mouse game for a spin and turn that you and even the count didn't see coming. \"The Handmaiden\" is one powerful tale of greed, lust, sex, and hierarchy proving that unexpected emotions take over and win in the end."

Before seeing this movie i kinda thought it would be slow paces story which will probably involve all above mentioned things, but boy oh boy surely i wasn't prepared for how this movie is great. If anything else, this movie isn't slow paced - at running time 2 h 15 min. it is a brilliantly crafted highly involving story. Directing, writing, cinematography were first rate as well as acting and set design. The story itself was very intriguing, but its the brilliant movie craftsmanship that made \"The Handmaiden\" into one of the best movies I've seen whole year (2016).\n\nOverall, \"The Handmaiden\" is definitely a movie that should be seen by everyone who enjoys great films (but not for the youngest ones as it shows some explicit sex scenes). It is a very beautifully filmed story, not predictable or boring for a second (!) and a highly involving one. Brilliant picture."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Handmaiden\" (2016 release from South Korea; 145 min.) brings the tale of a young maid in in Japan-occupied Korea, As the movie opens, we see Sook-hee leave her family behind to start working as the maid to rich and beautiful Lady Hideko. It's not long before we understand that in fact Sook-hee is there by design, as part of a plot involving a (fake) Fujiwara. Sook-hee must convince Lady Hideko to like and marry Fujiwara. But are things really what they look to be? At this point we're not even 15 minutes into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the latest movie from Korean director Park Chan-wook, who has previously brought us films like \"Oldboy\" and most recently \"Stoker\". Here he brings us a complex story (based on/transposed from British novelist Sarah Waters \"Fingersmith\") of deception and greed, set in a sexually charged environment. Like the book, the film consists of three parts. If you can count on one thing of director Park, it is that he brings is movies is a very stylish way, sometimes at the cost of substance (see: Stoker). But let me comfort you right away: while here also the movie is very stylish, it never does so at the expense of the substance. It took me quite a while to figure out who is who, and what exactly is happening, as we see a number of scenes more than once, but from different perspectives. Very helpful (and crucial to understanding the movie) is that at the beginning we are informed that yellow subtitles indicate Japanese is spoke, and white subtitles indicate Korean. BEWARE: there are a number of explicit sex scenes in the movie, reminiscent of \"Blue Is the Warmest Color\" (and causing the movie to be rated the equivalent of NC-17 in a number of countries). The two leading ladies, Kim Min-hee as Lady Hideko and Kim Tae-ri as Sook-hee, are nothing short of outstanding. At one point, when someone is relaying a particular story about Lady Hideko, someone interrupts and says: \"give more details! A story is all about the journey!\", and it is a perfect metaphor for this movie: yes, it is quite long (2 1/2 hrs.) but the journey is so worth it.\n\n\"The Handmaiden\" premiered at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year, and finally opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati this weekend. I couldn't wait to see it. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended quite nicely, given the time of the weekend and the length of the movie. Even if this doesn't play very long in theaters, this is the type of movie that hopefully will find a larger audience on Amazon Instant Video and eventually also on DVD/Blu-ray. \"The Handmaiden\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

I liked the way the film is divided into three chapters, with the storyline suddenly being seen from a different point of view. I wasn't, however, convinced by the portrayal of the relationship between the two women, who seem to be falling in lust rather than love. To me, the sex scenes are voyeuristic, though highly athletic (I envy their bodies!) and made me think of entries into the \"Year of the Sex Olympics\" rather than being erotic. Is this because the director is male?"

I can't recommend this to anyone. The extended graphic sex scenes don't serve the story at all and are just for ratings. How can anyone not see this is beyond me. The story is barely there and predictable after 30 minutes.\n\nI think that because there are Korean and Japanese languages spoken, rather well I'm told, that this movie gets a boost. Another boost for nudity and a bit of revenge. It's a 5 at best if you ignore these bonuses. I rate it a 4 because I'm expecting a good quality film from a respected director, who doesn't need to make soft core porn to increase his audience. It's a major let down and prevents his other films from being noticed."

The common elements of Park Chan-wook's other works are also present in this masterpiece, but I'd still say this one differs in some areas.\n\nSimilar to other movies in the director's filmography, 'Ah-ga-ssi' involves psychosexual dynamics, but unlike the others, it is built on them.\n\nThe twist element that is usually present in Park's films is also seen, but uncharacteristically, it's not revenge-related.\n\nThe film involves perversion combined with wealth as usual, and oddly, the psychosexual dynamics develop mostly outside the perversion in the movie.\n\nWe see a clash of social classes in the form of nobles-commoners, pure-sullied, innocent-criminal.\n\nOne of the best female-centric works I've seen in a long while.\n\nAlthough it's not a static film, it lacks the action element that other movies in Park Chan-wook's repertoire have.\n\nOverall, great plot and scenery. Sexually explicit. Not boring, but some parts felt protracted. After one plot point, the movie employs retrospective parallelism and explains every foreshadowing. It's quite entertaining to watch the revelation of these parallels, yet it's less appealing when there are 20 of them.\n\nIf the film had been shorter in duration, it would have scored 9/10 instead of 8/10.\n\nStill, without a doubt, great cinema.\""

From the moment the plot took its first unexpected turn, I knew I was in for a wild ride. The intricate storytelling had more twists and turns than a pretzel factory, and just when I thought I had it all figured out, the movie laughed in my face and revealed another layer of intrigue. I haven't been this bamboozled since I tried to assemble an IKEA bookshelf!\n\nThe cinematography was so stunning that it made me question my life choices. I mean, why didn't I become a handmaiden in a mysterious mansion with lavish gardens and opulent interiors? The visual feast matched the captivating performances, leaving me equal parts enchanted and flabbergasted. And oh, the costumes! I'm pretty sure I saw more traditional Korean hanboks in this film than I have in my entire existence. Bravo to the wardrobe department for making me question why my everyday attire doesn't include silk and elaborate headpieces.\n\nAll in all, \"The Handmaiden\" is like a puzzle that's been smashed into a kaleidoscope - you think you've got a handle on it, but then it gleefully shatters your expectations. While my brain might still be recovering from all the plot twists, I can't deny that I thoroughly enjoyed the mind-bending journey. It's a film that proves love, deception, and a killer dress collection are a recipe for cinematic gold."

Then there's a twist that I expected from the midway point but still enjoyed and then we get our perspective shifted a little more.\n\nThe Handmaiden tale is one of those movies described as \"erotic,\" which often means mediocre porn sequences and a little naughtiness (like \"Wild Things\"). But Handmaiden is genuinely hot, as the principals become intimate in a weirdly suspenseful way. The scene where a tooth is filed is genuinely erotic even though it's not really sexual - unlike a lot of \"erotic\" mainstream films, The Handmaiden knows how to tease for a while.\n\nThe principles are great, the story is fascinating, the movie is wildly cinematic, and the whole thing is weird and intense. Also, it's *fun* from beginning to end. There are certain movies by director Park Chan-Wook that I have avoided because they sound very not-fun (i.e. The disturbing-sounding Oldboy) but this movie is just genuinely fun throughout.\n\nHighly recommended."

While the cinematography is undoubtedly stunning, capturing each scene with exquisite detail and artful composition, it's not enough to keep the intrigue alive throughout the excessive runtime. These visual achievements, though impressive, cannot fully compensate for the film's tendency to dwell too long on minor elements, which ultimately dilutes the impact of the narrative and leaves you feeling bored. Overall, 'The Handmaiden,' with its promising storyline and exceptional visuals, fails to maintain engagement, making it a beautiful yet ultimately unsatisfying film. Rating: 6/10.\""

The story is so engrossing and TIGHTLY written. The twists and turns, I can't imagine the amount of work that went into the script itself. The characters are all beautifully layered, which is only enhanced by the great actors that portray them (and it must've been some WORK to play these characters who wear masks on top of masks throughout the film). The visuals and camera work are amazing as well. I particularly loved the colors and palette, which is so vivid and bright throughout. It really is an awe-inducing movie to look at.\n\nI cannot recommend this movie enough."

Park Chan Wook hardly disappoints, but this underrated gem is a piece of art. The chemistry and dedication between the two main characters, Hideko and Sook-hee, is incredible.\"My savior, who came to ruin my life\" is something I will never forget. That damn library scene!!"

The opening scenes seem very quick and it appears it may be too difficult to keep up for the fairly long running time but it turns out to be a breeze. The pace slows and we are rewarded for our early concentration as so much makes so much sense so soon. Not always so with Asian movies, for western audiences, it seems to me. Park has such a wonderful sense of framing and is not afraid to move his cameras in unconventional ways. The sumptuous interiors and exteriors may have the appearance of the equivalent of an English historic romance but here the cameras offer us views and movement more akin to a full on action movie. Split into three parts, I found myself slightly bewildered at the start of the second section but soon caught up with the audaciousness of Mr Park and his co-writer. Beautiful, explicit, daring and rewarding, this is top notch film making."

        "review_detailed_main": "'THE HANDMAIDEN': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)\n\nAnother South Korean critically acclaimed erotic thriller, from filmmaker Park Chan-wook (who's also helmed such beloved South Korean hits as 'OLD BOY' and 'THIRST'). Chan-wook directed and co- wrote the movie, with Jeong Seo-kyeong (a frequent writing collaborator of his). The script is loosely based on the novel 'Fingersmith', by Sarah Waters, with the Victorian era setting changed to Japanese-occupied Korea. It tells the story of a conman that hires a pickpocket, to pose as a handmaiden for a depressed Japanese heiress, in order to rob her (through an elaborate plot). The movie stars Kim Min-hee, Kim Tae-ri and Ha Jung-woo. It's received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, and it's also won, or been nominated for, several prestigious awards. I enjoyed it.\n\nThe story is set in Korea, at the time it was under Japanese colonial rule. A conman, going by the name of Count Fujiwara (Jung- woo), hires a pickpocket, named Sook-hee (Tae-ri), to pose as a handmaiden for a severely depressed Japanese heiress, named Lady Hideko (Min-hee). Fujiwara plots to marry Hideko, and then have her committed to an insane asylum; in order to steal her fortune. He enlists Sook-hee to help him. Sook-hee agrees to the plan, but then she develops feelings for the heiress. Things only become more complicated from there!\n\nThe film is a great female empowerment love story, it's also (once again) beautifully shot, and masterfully edited, by Chan-wook (I love his visual style). The screenplay is also brilliant; and although it starts out slow, it becomes really involving. It's also full of really passionate, and quite erotic, sex scenes. If that's your thing, it's full of them; but it is all part of the story (and rich character development). It's also one of the highest rated movies of 2016, by many critics, and I can see why.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/_SLO5GYrmps"

At times, it comes across as period drama, at times it is a romantic love story, at times it is an erotic psycho thriller... but despite having so many different aspects to it, the film never looses itself. Everything is tightly woven together like the heiress's corset.\n\nPrecisely because THE HANDMAIDEN is so rich and multi-faceted, it will be difficult for me to pin down what exactly makes this movie so compelling. Perhaps it is the fact that it is so deeply erotic, in a very sensual manner? Perhaps it is the beautiful historical set pieces, the crafty camera-work and the magnificent score? Perhaps it is the fact that the story continues to surprise you and keep you on the edge with ever-new twists? Perhaps it is the mystery that seethes through every shot of the movie?\n\nThese questions can only be answered if you watch this film. Be prepared to be sucked up into a world of obscure obsessions, hidden desires and betrayal."

        "review_detailed_main": "''The Handmaiden'' is a mesmerizing period drama that convinces with a twisted story, gloomy settings, an atmospheric score, precise cinematography, profound characters and incredible acting performances. It consists of three parts, the first two leading to clever twists and the last one to a satisfactory conclusion that leaves no questions unanswered if you watch carefully. The story is set in Japanese-occupied Korea and tells the story of a thief's daughter who is collaborating with a clever crook in order to steal the inheritance of a rich Japanese lady living in seclusion with her perverted uncle. Telling you anything more would take away from the movie's brilliant storytelling.\n\nThe movie has a slow pace but develops a melancholic atmosphere right from the start with the very first scene until the final freeze frame. Despite a few necessary repetitions in the story due to a few shifts in perspective, the movie passed surprisingly quickly despite a running time of nearly two and a half hours.\n\nThe story is clever and emotional with its twists and turns. Some twists are hard to predict while others are easier to figure out and others again aren't directly revealed throughout the movie but they are all told carefully, elegantly and profoundly. This movie doesn't only stimulate your genitals and your heart but also your brain.\n\nThe film should only be watched by mature adults since it includes a lot of eroticism. The movie carefully contrasts cold sexual abuse and passionate romance in a balanced way. This isn't only done by performing credible sexual intercourse in front of the camera. This is also told through facial expressions, quotes from erotic novels and appropriate settings. While more conservative minds could be shocked, one should note that every single scene adds to the clever story and the depth of the characters. This movie doesn't include any sexual innuendo and no pornographic movie could even slightly achieve what this movie does. This is truly a lesson in eroticism performed by highly skilled actors and actresses and this combination makes this movie stand out.\n\nIn the end, the combination of intense emotions, profound eroticism and an intelligent story in a movie involving outstanding actors and actresses and directed by one of the world's best directors makes this one of the very best period dramas ever made in the history of cinema. Not only genre fans will adore this movie but any adult with a genuine interest in cinema should watch this contemporary masterpiece."

        "review_detailed_main": "Watching The Handmaiden is an interesting, evocative experience similar to the director's other work, even though it does not reach the heights of Oldboy (2003), it is highly entertaining. The story is really captivating, leading you on until it is ready to reveal what is actually underneath the film's skirt. As with most films that are separated into parts, there is a slightly weaker one in the middle, as the movie slows down and back tracks for you to catch up. However, overall this was a really interesting script that suited the new setting (Korea under Japanese colonial rule) well.\n\nSimilar with Park Chan-Wook's other films that I have seen, Oldboy (2003) and Stoker (2013), this is a gorgeous movie. Beautifully shot sets that look incredible, and the estate on which most of the film takes place is an incredible location. The beautiful costumes replicating the early 20th century time period make this film quite visually stunning. The performances by the three main stars Kim Min- hee, Ha Jung-woo and Kim Tae-ri were all exceptional.\n\nOne of the film's strengths is its ability to seamlessly incorporate comedic elements into what could have been quite a serious movie. In a movie that involves themes such as suicide and fraud, it is hard to believe how many times it made the audience laugh out loud. Although the tone does get darker at times, the lighter moments make it just a really fun movie as well. Although the music wasn't as amazing as the song used in the international trailer, it does serve its purpose effectively. There are also minor details like the use of color in the subtitles to distinguish between Korean and Japanese which I really appreciated.\n\nThe film also involves a high level of debauchery that leads to it being very sexually graphic in many parts of the film. Although the director has done similar things in the past, I felt like in those earlier films it served more of a purpose whereas in this film, while there are some moments that do develop characters and the story, there is an abundance of gratuitous sex scenes that elongate the movie a little too much.\n\nI found The Handmaiden to be a really enjoyable film that didn't disappoint my expectations of the director. It was a really intriguing story that is complimented by the great craftsmanship of all those involved. The film does show some unjustified sex scenes that may be off putting to some viewers but some may also enjoy it."

And that would rank it higher than Shane, The African Queen, The Searchers, and Sophie's Choice. All of the aforementioned films are among the top 100 films of all time, according to the AFI. Nor was this movie overrated by one demographic group.\n\nThis movie did not have an MPAA rating but would certainly have deserved an X rating with the number of explicit sexual scenes. None of this would matter if the sexuality needed to be so explicit to advance the plot. It didn't.\n\nThere are movies which are fundamentally about a sexual relationship, and are honest about it, such as The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover or the Last Tango in Paris. One should expect THESE films to be quite explicit. The Handmaiden is NOT such a film. There IS a story being told and EVEN THOUGH the father is quite depraved it is not necessary to exploit this in telling the story. In fact, it is a diversion from the telling of the main story line.\n\nSo why was the story told in this way? The answer is clear: sex sells. It even sold a substantial number of those who reviewed the film at IMDb. Amazon appears to have mastered the use of the sensational. Now it is true that there is some excellent cinematography, but that cannot redeem this film.\n\nClearly, a film goer cannot depend on IMDb or even on the combined ratings of the critics to find worthy entertainment. More caution is required."

        "review_title": "An absolutely psychotic but exhilarating film",
        "review_detailed_main": "This is quite an exceptional film. With two and a half hours of intense, rapid-fire betrayal, unpredictability and purely psychotic thrills, The Handmaiden is an intoxicating watch from start to finish. Directed stupendously by Park Chan-wook, and featuring three amazing central performances, it's a film that will grab you with its unbelievable levels of insanity and darkness, but will thrill you again and again with a sumptuous and confident execution of an enthralling story.\n\nLet's first establish what on earth this film really is, and why that makes it so brilliant. On the one hand, this works on its own as a period thriller, with the setting of Korea under Japanese colonial rule allowing for some insight into the time period of the 1920s-30s, as well as some beautiful costume and production design, all of which plays a big role in making the film as elegant as it is.\n\nOn the other hand, the story is an incredibly intense affair featuring twists and turns the likes of which you've never seen. The film is directed by Park Chan-wook, who also made the legendarily messed-up thriller Oldboy, a fact that's even more disturbing when you realise that The Handmaiden is in more ways than one even more psychotic and terrifying than that movie.\n\nThe story is one of deception, betrayal and love from start to finish, and in that, it's very reminiscent of two classic thrillers. The style of its story, featuring three acts based around three enormous but totally unpredictable twists, is much like how David Fincher's Gone Girl plays out, whilst the content of the story, involving two characters secretly working together to get one over on someone they have befriended is hugely reminiscent of Diabolique, a film so effective in its thrills that it actually influenced the success of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.\n\nAnyway, it's a plot that's difficult to talk about without giving away any spoilers, but it is one that is utterly thrilling at every moment. Not just an unpredictable mystery, but a story so full of depth and emotional intrigue, allowing its characters to flourish in the most unorthodox of ways as the plot snowballs towards breaking point.\n\nHowever, the plot alone isn't what makes this film so amazing. Above all, Park Chan-wook's direction plays a huge role in that. As we know, Park is a director with the ability to not just weird you out, but chill you to the bone with some pretty demented stories.\n\nHere, he doesn't hold back even for a second when it comes to portraying the sheer brutality of the lead trio. The story that unfolds effectively takes the form of a love triangle, but Park makes sure to emphasise the darker side of that sort of conflict by filling the film with some incredibly frank and unbelievably graphic sex.\n\nNow, many films go too far on this front and become completely gratuitous, but that's not the case with The Handmaiden. Although there are two scenes that are almost unwatchable given their graphic nature, the sex scenes play an incredibly powerful and central role to the entire story, and without being portrayed in such a frank and carnal manner, the intensity of the story and the betrayals that come about as a result would never have been so strong.\n\nAnother reason that the film is so intense is simply because it just doesn't stop. It may run for almost two and a half hours, but believe me, that time feels no more than ten minutes thanks to the unbelievable pace of the movie. Split up into three perfect parts whose structure messes with your perceptions of the story as much as anything else in this movie, the story moves along at an almost relentless pace, continuing to snowball as things get far darker, and far, far more disturbing, but it makes for an incredible viewing experience that leaves you completely intoxicated from the very first scene to the very last.\n\nFinally, we can't forget the performances, which are just as brilliant as everything else in the movie. The leading trio are exceptional to watch, and they work amazingly on screen with one another, with just enough chemistry to make their cordial relationships convincing, and yet enough alarm in their individual turns to keep everything on a knife edge.\n\nKim Min-hee is amazing as the Japanese heiress, and is able to throw you way off scent when it comes to really figuring out what her character is all about. Then Kim Tae-ri is just as brilliant as the handmaiden herself, and shows an incredible level of intensity as what at first seems like the film's most orthodox character. And finally, Ha Jung-woo excels as the Korean man disguising himself as a Japanese count to win the heiress' affections (and fortune), with a strong, and often even frightening performance bringing total unpredictability to proceedings.\n\nOn the whole, I was absolutely blown away by The Handmaiden. It's an intense and at times jaw-dropping piece of work that will have your eyes glued to the screen at almost every second. Directed beautifully by Park Chan-wook, it's an elegant period drama crossed with one of the most intense and demented thrillers you'll ever see, and its incredibly graphic sex will have you cowering away while being simultaneously stunned by the dramatic power on display. Its two and a half hours pass by in an instant, but its intensity and purely psychotic nature will stay with you long afterwards."

In its first part the film subverts this formula, then the second part of the film reveals a new layer of the first part, and each characters' motivations begin to unfold into a complex and involving romantic thriller with thematic depth.\n\nVisually, the film is incredible. Every shot feels meticulously controlled by Park Chan-wook. The color palette consistently matches the tone of the scene and the camera flows through each scene perfectly. There is a lot of sex in this film, but it's done tastefully and the cinematography in these scenes accurately depicts the passion of the characters.\n\nThe music enhances every scene. The music in this film is amazing and gives the film the feel of an epic. The film builds slowly to start, but once it picks up it doesn't let up. The film is tightly written and involves several complex and intriguing characters participating in complex interpersonal relationships. The performances are fantastic across the board, and although I've only seen the film once I can tell it may be even better on repeat viewings."

        "review_detailed_main": "The same story can be told in countless ways, and \"The Handmaiden\" could have been yet one more erotic thriller if it wasn't directed by Park Chan-wook. The fascinatingly decadent mood, the quirky way he mixes opposite genres, the sharp black humor and sarcasm even in the worst situations, the visceral depiction of sex and sensuality, the way he keeps adding more and more to the plate and stop right before it overflows. Despite the demanding running time the pacing is consistently tight: there is always a lot going on on-screen both aesthetically and narratively, but never to the point it becomes overwhelming.\n\nThe only thing that could have been better might be the ending, as the twists in the middle inevitably lead you to set even higher expectations for the finale. You get mindblown the first time, but everything starts to become quite predictable after you grasp the general tone.\n\nThe film clearly plays with gender roles, but one more concept explored is Korea's identity during Japan's colonization. We see a lot of Koreans who try to imitate the Japanese lifestyle, but at the same time Japanese are under the strong influence of western countries. The mansion Hideko lives in is a hybrid of Japanese and British architecture, owned by a Korean who pretends to be a Japanese man of letters. Count Fujiwara is another example of Korean aspiring to be a Japanese gentleman dressed in British fashion. They both flaunt their Japanese language skills while Hideko, who is supposed to be an actual Japanese, doesn't like to speak her own language as it represents the readings imposed by her uncle.\n\nThe use of two languages generates some interesting situations, even though sometimes the actors' Korean accent gets so thick that it was hard to understand some of the Japanese lines. It's understandable for Kouzuki and Fujiwaraas are supposed to be Korean in the story, but Hideko was not so believable as a Japanese."

This happened 2 or 3 times. So you start watching the movie thinking you know what's going to happen but you really don't. The complicity between the two women becomes the highlight of the movie, and the key to figure it all out. It has three parts and they work just like a puzzle. I'm glad they decided to do that, because it is also why the movie is so good. The actress who plays the handmaiden gives an outstanding performance. I loved it."

Sookee, a pretty petty thief, is picked to be the handmaiden at the estate that Japanese heiress Hideko shares with her manipulative uncle. Sookee is part of a plot to steal Hideko's inheritance. She doubts she can carry through with the plan however, once she discovers feelings for her vulnerable and beautiful mistress. Yet no one is as vulnerable as they appear.\n\nThe Handmaiden is riveting, surprising, complex, beautiful and oh so passionate. The story is full of unexpected twists and turns that are delightful as well as eerie. I felt I knew where the story and characters were going, yet things took surprisingly different turns. The cinematography, sets, clothing and actors are entrancing in their splendor. There is substantial depth to the dialogue, characters, scenes, themes and schemes. The passion expressed in the film is felt like a pulse of electricity in each touch, scent, expression of empathy, sight of red lips, and more. Korean and Japanese sub-titles helpfully appear in different colors for those who have a hard time distinguishing between the languages."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Handmaiden (2016): Most of the erotic thrillers of recent times failed to impress because the makers are only focusing on ridiculous sex scenes than the plot.I have watched only few erotic thrillers like Poison Ivy,Basic Instinct and Unfaithful.The Handmaiden,a South Korean film got universal acclaim and I had huge expectations on Korean films especially after watching The Wailing.The Handmaiden is directed by acclaimed filmmaker Park Chan Wook.So how is The Handmaiden?\n\nPlot: 1930s Korea, in the period of Japanese occupation, a new girl Sookee (Tae-re Kim) is hired as a handmaiden to a Japanese heiress Hideko (Kim Min-hee) who lives a secluded life on a large countryside estate with her domineering Uncle Kouzuki (Jin-woong Jo). But the maid has a secret. She is a pickpocket recruited by a swindler posing as a Japanese Count (Jung-woo Ha) to help him seduce the Lady to elope with him, rob her of her fortune, and lock her up in a madhouse. The plan seems to proceed according to plan until Sookee and Hideko discover some unexpected emotions.\n\nPlus Points:\n\n1)Screenplay and Direction: The Handmaiden is brilliantly crafted erotic psychological thriller with great twists and turns.Movie is told in 3 parts and all of the parts have great thrills and emotion.Movie starts as drama and later takes a twist at the end of Part 1 and in the second part we get lot of twists which gives us meaning of unanswered questions in Part 1.Park Chan Wook did an commendable job in directing those picture.He cleverly managed to tell a simple revenge in an interesting manner.\n\n2)Performances: New comer Tae-re Kim did splendidly well in a challenging role.Debuting in a intimate role is not a great start but she did it and scored big and her sexually inexperienced heiress, a layered turn from Kim Min-hee.Kin-Woong Jo as Uncle Kouzuki is impressive.\n\n3)Background Score: The Handmaiden has haunting score which elevated lot of scenes.It provided a creepiness feel to the scenes.The music during sex scenes are seducing.\n\n4)Cinematography: The film is beautifully shot with rich visuals and greenery locations.\n\nMinus Points:\n\n1)Amount of Sex and Nudity: The Handmaiden has lot of explicit sex scenes which may disturb few audience but more importantly, there's longing, affection and intimacy between the maid, and her sexually inexperienced heiress.\n\nSo,The Handmaiden is an excellent erotic psychological thriller with twisty screenplay,terrific direction and performances.\n\nMy rating 8.25/10"

The first thing I would like to point out is the stunning cinematography, which stays consistently good throughout the movie.\n\nThe performances were amazing, especially from the two female leads, Min-hee Kim and Kim Tae-ri. They have amazing chemistry together and leave the audience rooting for them the entire run time. The story was compelling and beautifully composed so that the viewer never really knows what's going on until the very end - not for a second did I get bored. I absolutely loved seeing the events of the film depicted from different character's perspectives. This is the type of movie that requires multiple viewings to get the full experience.\n\nPark Chan-Wook nails it with the direction, as was expected of him at this point. He doesn't shy away from explicit content and the entire movie has this erotic aura surrounding it. At the same time it manages to be one of the most empowering movies for women I've seen in a long time and the movie that the LGBT community has been waiting for, which I believe is extremely important for Hollywood at this time. Let's just hope that other movies follow \"The Handmaiden's\" lead. A truly refreshing representation of homosexuality in film.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a masterfully crafted movie that I would recommend to everybody, definitely one of the highlights of 2016. I can't wait to see what Park Chan-Wook has in store for us next and am excited to keep following his work."

It turns out it was a very enjoyable movie involving intrigue, eroticism, abuse, love, and mystery.\n\nThe premise is pretty straight forward. A thief/pickpocket is enlisted to help con a young rich woman out of her money. What follows is a well written character study of what can happen when emotions get involved (or don't get involved).\n\nIt is presented in three stages, each with its own particular slant towards the story. The first part seems to center on a budding relationship that might flower into love. The second part concentrates more on the erotic side of that relationship. And the third part is about the culmination of that relationship.\n\nOverall, all three parts were very solid and interesting, but I have to confess that each subsequent part was not quite as good as the previous one. I wholeheartedly recommend this for anyone who likes a good plot driven movie with a bit of eroticism thrown in."

        "review_detailed_main": "To be honest I have seen only film of Park chan wook and that is the masterpiece, Oldboy. This movie is set in a different era and beautifully captured. Full of sexuality and mystery, The Handmaiden is how a erotic thriller should be made. The Hindi film industry, especially should take notes. So let's go into details.\n\nSTORY - The story is of a family of con-men and forgers who are planning to con a very wealthy family for a huge sum of money. Lady Hideko, who is the heir to all the wealth is set to marry her uncle, because, well he is the only person she knows and he is greedy. This con-man poses as a Count in an attempt to woo her, make her fall in love and then elope. Fearing that he can't do it alone, he brings in one of his accomplices to be her handmaiden so that she could keep coaxing Hideko to fall in love with the Count. An unexpected turn of events, sets the plans of each of the characters onto a different trajectory. I don't want to blurt out the plot because that will just ruin the twist. The characters are well built and I as an audience had a love-hate relationship with each of them because none of them were exactly white and black. Everyone had shades of grey, and it was fun to watch how these characters used their wit to outsmart each other. Sook-hee and Hideko, both come for dark pasts but still, it wasn't easy to root for them. The uncle, Kouzuki was just plain evil. I mean he hits a kid with metal balls. Come on.\n\nDIRECTION - Park chan wook took a huge risk to keep an erotic thriller at a run-time of over 2 hours. It was risky, but it paid off. He took his time building the characters, not rushing in any one the three chapters, so that when the final twist came, you wouldn't feel like it was a cop-out of some sort. Even though the ending can be expected after the first twist, but the length of the movie that is left after the first twist did produce a sense of doubt. The best performance is of course by the title character, Sook-hee. She portrays the funny, innocent yet deceiving person that she is. I felt that the actress for Hideko, was a bit bland. I would have loved to see her portray some more expressions when the camera was pointed just at her. As I said, Jin Woong-jo who played Kouzuki didn't have much space to do anything other than playing the usual tropes of a villain. I absolutely loved the arc of Count Fujiwara. The thing that I loved most, was the little shots in between which showed a sudden burst of emotion. Almost like a darker version of Edgar Wright's method of shooting such scenes.\n\nCINEMATOGRAPHY - The whole movie felt like a beautiful painting. The colours were rich. Not a single scene had a wrong choice of colour. Many movies show very brutal scenes under sunlight and that kind of decreases the intensity. Here the feel was captured so beautifully. Even when the same scene was shown at different points of the movie, you could notice the difference. When the same story was being shown from the POV of different characters, the exact same scene had a different feel. It was a delight for the eyes. Chung-hoo Chung struck a beautiful balance between outdoor and indoor shots. It was very important because one wrong palette and the whole mystery would have vanished.\n\nFINAL VERDICTS - Well, to be honest I was expecting a bizarre ending like Oldboy but I wasn't disappointed because what I saw was a masterpiece. Even though the two twists, for me, felt not so realistic. Certainly worth a watch. I advise you to not go expecting loads of sex because even though there is a lot of it, the setting of those scenes can make you feel really uncomfortable."

However, Sook-Hee soon develops a fondness for Lady Hideko and this could potentially jeopardise the plan.\n\nIntriguing drama, directed by Chan-wook Park of Oldboy, Lady Vengeance and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance fame. First half is brilliant, with good scene-setting, plot development and an amazing twist.\n\nIf the focus and momentum of the first half were kept up we were heading for masterpiece territory. However, the second half is less compelling and plausible, with a few plot developments that don't make sense and some twists that seem there for twists sake. Momentum is lost as we have a new round of backstory, and this seems overwrought and overly long, and much of it seems unnecessary.\n\nThere are one or two surprises towards the end but the resolution of the main plot is pretty predictable from a point.\n\nUltimately, an interesting and reasonably absorbing story but could have been brilliant."

And in typical Park Chan-Wook fashion, a lot of twists, turns, and revelations come to fruition and ends up creating one of the most mesmerizing cinematic experiences I've had in 2016. Seriously, this man knows his craft and manages to mix intricate plot with some of his stylish filmmaking techniques in order to flesh out every scene in awe-sparring fashion.\n\nIts a near perfect blend of style and substance that lends itself in giving you a fascinating story along with beautifully crafted shots, angles, and transitions to boost it's already well-made plot. The acting from everyone is simply phenomenal. From the main to the supporting cast, there is not a single weak performance in this film. Plus, it contains a gorgeous score that complements every scene taking place and its one of the best I've heard all year. As for the sexy, erotic elements that the film had to offer, well, all I can say is that they don't hold back anything and Chan-Wook is very direct and to the point with the subject matter at hand.\n\nIn the end, \"The Handmaiden\" is hands down of the best movies I've seen in 2016. Just leave it to one of the greatest South Korean directors to show us the true artistry that cinema has to offer. Its definitely a film that you should seek out immediately if its playing in your area and its one that'll leave me thinking for quite some time.

The direction is impeccable and the two leads immerse themselves in their roles. You truly believe they each embody their respective characters. The gentle blossoming of their relationship is not played out for the male gaze and shows a depth of tenderness you rarely find in western films of similar genre.\n\nThe sets are lush and you can practically smell the blossoms through the screen, and the oils and rose petals gently perfuming our lady's bath. It is a feast for the senses from the costumes to the exterior shots, this is a film of staggering beauty. Also, sapphic love in all its tenderness is there not to feed the male fantasy but is there because it truly belongs there. The loving exchanges are beautifully filmed and tender in their exchange. Beautiful all around.\n\nIf you like historical drama ( those that may take artistic liberties for stake of the story ) beautiful sets and exquisite costuming and corsetry ( and a tender and believable story to go along with it ) DO NOT let this film pass you buy. I was lucky enough to catch this before it was due to leave Amazon Prime, it had been a film I glanced at and then almost forgot to get back to. I am so glad I did not miss this beautiful film. I will definitely be buying a copy.\n\nThis is a solid 10/10 and should be on everyone's to watch list."

I have to admit that I was surprised by the ammount of sexual scenes, but they were made with a very good level/niveau.\n\nAt first I wanted to give it a 8-star rating, but the movie stayed in my mind for over a week. And when a movie can surprise me during the movie and even more in the week afterwards, it is a definitely a very good movie. And I'm sure that I will like it even more in a rewatch."

Very well done.\n\nAlso the landscape, it makes you dream of going to Korea and Japan if you haven't been there yet.\n\nThen the plot, it changes so many times that in the end, you don't even know, what is the actual story, who are the good and the bad guys. Sex, Sado, it is a provocative movie, but not ordinary. It is just how is meant to be.\n\nIt's a long movie, and not very active, but Really worth watching."

        "review_detailed_main": "In one of my intermittent conversations with IMDb legend Bob The Moo he recommended a 2016 South Korean film THE HANDMAIDEN. Having total faith in Bob I did make a mental note of getting round to seeing it when I had some spare time. As with any recommendation I also made a mental note of not looking up the recommendation for obvious reasons. After all I did look up a couple of early online reviews of THE MUMMY earlier today and let's just say they let the cat out of the bag. It's hardly a surprise when a film is ruined because surprise is given away. The only thing I knew in advance before seeing THE HANDMAIDEN was that the director was Park Chan-wook who made the overrated OLDBOY which reminded of something else - Bob also once recommended me THE FOUNTAIN , a film I thought was pretentious rubbish\n\nPark is something of an auteur. Revenge is a theme that intrigues him as a film maker but not in the way Hollywood would develop a revenge thriller where Bruce , Arnie , Sly or Chuck would wreak revenge on creeps via an arsenal of firearms and explosives and I'm not entirely sure if that's a compliment. By the same token it's not necessarily a complaint either but I did feel the narrative execution could have been developed better. There might be a problem in that the original source novel was set in Victorian Britain rather than 1930s Korea but I don't think it's that. What I found annoying was the constant need for characters explaining what is happening which is usually obvious and why it's happening when it's not obvious at the time but becomes obvious later on. It's certainly a complex film where objects that seem meaningless make reappearances as plot turns. Also as with OLDBOY there's a somewhat sleazy story which the audience will find divisive\n\nOne thing that will never , ever shake my faith in Bob The Moo is that he knows a great looking film when he sees one. I might have hated the fractured storyline of THE FOUNTAIN but at least Aronofsky understands what cinematography is, even if he takes it to excess. With THE HANDMAIDEN director Park and cinematographer Chung Chung-hoon have made a stunning looking film which while I was sitting in front of a laptop in a smoky Edinburgh flat made me think I was either walking around rural Japan or stuck in a Japanese mansion with a bunch of deviants, Another good aspect is the editing which gives the film a pace that can't be faulted especially compared to the average Hollywood movie. There is one technical aspect I found irritating and that was the intrusive music but again this is very subjective\n\nIt's certainly the visuals that impressed me with this movie , the story less so. Or should I say how the story is executed. As I said the story itself is rather complex but the constant need to spell things out shows a painful lack of confidence"

That still holds true for yours truly, but it still pleases me that my personal Top 50 can change even when I'm in my 30s.\n\nThe Handmaiden is the tale of a young con artist named Sook-hee (Kim Tae-ri), hired by a man to play the role of a handmaiden for an umarried, wealthy heiress named Lady Hideko (Kim Min-hee), who he wishes to seduce, marry and then get rid off. But things get complicated when Sook-hee starts to develop feelings for Hideko. Even more so when the tumultuous and horrid details of Hideko's life start to become known.\n\nThe Handmaiden is told in three parts, from three different perspectives, each going through many of the same events as the previous ones, but each revealing more and more. They stick with the scene longer or start earlier, allowing us to see that not everything is at it seems. And that works beautifully. This is a layered story at its best. No matter how much you've guessed, no matter how much you already know, there's always just a bit more to figure out, a bit more to the story. And it just works.\n\nPlus the film is just beautifully told and executed. The camera angels, the costuming, the sets, the dialogue, the acting. The director Chan-wook Park was already an international sensation thanks to his Vengeance trilogy, especially its middle film Oldboy, but this just might blow that film out of the park.\n\nFantastic film. Daring, inventive, inquisitive, secretive, revealing, sexy, sly and all around great. A must see film for all fans of cinema."

A good film is supposed to keep its audience engaged, not have the audience thinking about something else, let alone another film. And I guess that's one of the reasons I was reluctant to give it a higher score. I also found myself struggling to enjoy the film within the first 30 minutes. Actually, I was dozing off, yet another not-so-good indicator. The acting of both female leads (or co-leads)was top notch. I couldn't say the same for the 2 male characters, Jung-woo Ha and Jin-woong Jo. I've seen both of them in other films, where they gave much better performances, so I guess it was a question of chemistry or miscasting. Or maybe I was just subconsciously biased because of the intense female sexuality in the plot. Either way, I wasn't convinced by the male characters. On a positive note, the production was impeccable (almost too perfect) and the twist in the story definitely resuscitated my attention halfway through. All in all, based on my rating, this is not a bad film, but I guess I would tell anyone who wanted to see this to make sure they lower their expectations; that way, they'll definitely enjoy it more than I did!"

But more than anything, The Handmaiden is just pure cinema, a dizzying, disturbing fable of love and betrayal that piles on luxurious imagery, while never losing track of its story's human core. For Park, the Korean director of crossover genre hits like Old Boy and Thirst, the movie feels like an evolutionary leap forward in an already brilliant career."

The last maybe half an hour deviates from the overall tone of the movie by quite a bit. I think the glut of story ideas should be pared down a little bit, for I feel like the film is too obsessed with surprises. Aside from that, the film is very perfectly executed, its highlight being the strong characters."

With lots of twists sometimes movies become boring and feels that the writer is trying too hard but no not this one. Everything falls in it's place perfectly. The style of story telling with non-linear narrative lends it a fitting way to convey the story. All the actors are stupendous, couldn't have played their part any better. Specially the Handmaiden, for me it was love at the first sight. Her innocence, beauty and smile took my heart away. Similarly the Lady Hideko played her part with utmost perfection . The Villains also come out and deliver a perfect performance. Talking about cinematography ; it is picture perfect, the color combination sometimes remind one of Wes Anderson . The Music too is crafted in a suitable manner and makes it more emotionally charged and gives it a strong feel. I usually don't just praise a movie but point out what I thought was missing but sorry this time there is nothing I think about. If you want to see a sensual, dramatic, unpredictable movie this is perfect treat for you. They don't make it like this anymore."

In fact most of the characters had some quirky sexual interests and were generally all sex obsessed.\n\nIn the beginning, it seemed to be quite an engaging romance of betrayal, but it took an odd turn halfway through in what was referred to as \"Part Two\", when it all became about a kinky book club I had imagined something more along the lines of 'Memoirs Of A Geisha' (2005) and less like a marriage of 'Shortbus' (2006) or 'Dangerous Liaisons' (1988), so I was quite shocked by the content and not particularly impressed either, because the story didn't really seem to be anything new and appeared to be all about getting as many lesbian sexual acts in to one film as possible. It was definitely not one to watch with Mother.\n\nPerhaps if it had been about an affair between two men, I might have seen it differently, but I don't think that I would, unless it had been made more thoughtfully too.\n\nThe acting was fine, but difficult to pinpoint anything outstanding and the cinematography was quite pretty or well set up too, with great sets, props and costumes, but I just couldn't get along with the story after it hit that \"Part Two\".\n\n477.65/1000."

        "review_detailed_main": "Park Chan-wook's succulent period drama is a three-act intrigue set in a Japanese-occupied Korea, a close-knit cast includes a Japanese heiress Lady Hideko (Kim Min-hee), her newly hired handmaiden Sook-hee (Kim Tae-ri, in her blazing film debut), the professed Count Fujiwara (Ha Jung-woo), a Korean con artist who is wooing Hideko but schemes to wrest for the marriage's collateral financial gain, and Hideko's current guardian, her uncle Kouzuki (Jo Jin-woong), a Korean book collector who is spoiling for a Japanese identity, and has no qualm of marrying his niece as long as he could keep a tight rein on the latter's magnanimous inheritance.\n\nThe narrative is succinctly coordinated among the central quartet and starts from Act I, we peer into the game plan from the angle of Sook-hee, she is not a dewy-eyed lamb as the first impression suggests, but an orphan pickpocket equipped with street smart and a yen for wealth (her con artist mother died during parturition), colluded with Fujiwara, she is arranged near Lady Hideko to sweet-talk her into the marriage, which Fujiwara plans to throw her into an asylum once it is consummated, so he can hog Hideko's assets, among which Sook-hee also demands a handsome paycheck. Things get complicated when Sook-hee is swooned by a doll-like Lady Hideko, whose delicacy and naivety, the aftermath of a reclusive lifestyle imposed by Kouzuki, is something she never expects to encounter and once her sexual awakening stands in the way of Fujiwara's plan, there is no telling who will come off as the winner. Act I ends with a bang in your face, a twist segues into Act II, now we get the perspective from Lady Hideko.\n\nSheepish is not an apposite word to describe Hideko, she can be calculating and menacing (no one can indeed see the whole picture, that's the lure of its narrative game: offer us a chance to leafing through those often imperceptible), flashback of her childhood, with her now defunct aunt (Moon So-ri in a transfixing cameo as the fruitcake) emblazons the perversity of Kouzuki and his reading club, where her aunt (later herself) are trained to narrate (sometimes even perform, with a wooden puppet for instance) erotic and often kinky stories from the antique books in front of an all-male audience, those who are solvent enough to participate in the auction of these said salacious urtexts, that's where Fujiwara first lays his eyes on Lady Hideko.\n\nAnother grand revelation finally sets straight its multi-buried subterfuge, in the Act III, where Park Chan-wook's unloosed endorsement of womanhood reaches its exuberant zenith, women are f\u00eated by the abandon of sexual liberalization (under a vibrant pace) whereas men are doomed in their Freudian subservience (heightened by an overt self-referential appearance of a giant octopus, Park's trademark metaphor of pervert and ruination).\n\nLeading lady Kim Min-hee impeccably holds court here, conveying a tangy impression of Goddess finesse mingled with unpredictability, mystique, and empathy, her ageless countenance adorned by the gorgeous period costume and make-up, cogently embodies the most alluring quality of oriental feminism, paired with a ludic but emboldened Kim Tae-ri, their resultant eye-popping soft-core sex sequences dare to give BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR (2013) a run for its money. Ha Jung-woo, the superstar of South Korean cinema, dutifully deploys a broader touch to transmit a tinge of caricature and incredulity in a supporting job that elicits our sympathy even when on paper, his character shouldn't.\n\nInveterately operatic, ravishingly sumptuous, THE HANDMAIDEN tops off a none-too-novel plotting and scheming pulp with an absolutely captivating momentum which leaves its rapt audience feel triumphant and thoroughly justified, all by dint of Park's upmarket artistry, aesthetic sensibility and gallant vision."

        "review_detailed_main": "THE HANDMAIDEN is a great film. It seems to glow with creativity and beauty with each new scene, and during the entirety of its over 2 hour run time I found myself entranced by a slow-churning mystery that left me once again excited by the craft a good movie can make appear so easy.\n\nThe film is a South Korean production helmed by director Chan-wook Park, known mostly in America as the director of 'Oldboy.' People often say that foreign films demonstrate a higher quality in comparison to the stuff of Hollywood; that stories are daring and the craft is not as pressured by executives who would rather turn a profit than make something truly substantial. Did they ever get it right.\n\nThe movie is a period piece that is lush in costumes and sets. Each new shot paints a picture on the screen that simply pulls one into the world of South Korea in the 1930's. The cinematography, a lush landscape of vibrant hues and meticulous staging, keeps us engaged as though by hypnotism. The story follows three people, each scheming in their own right, telling the audience information that might only be a passing thought in their mind. In the simplest form, the story is of a conman who hopes to rob a wealthy woman (Lady Hideko) of her inheritance by feigning love with her and posing as a Count. Once married, he will find her mentally unsound and throw her in a mental institution, leaving him to bask in a newfound fortune. In order to make the most of his plan, he sends a maid (another con artist named Sook-Hee) to infiltrate the Lady's home and gain information and insight into the mind of the woman.\n\nThe film opens with a scene of forgers and thieves who meet to hear the \"Count's\" plan. He runs a business of sorts, forging money, legal papers, and jewelry. He promises them a cut of the fortune assuming they can help pass himself off as a man of means. Sook- Hee, for her troubles, is promised $50,000 and a new wardrobe once Hideko is institutionalized. She is a simple girl, illiterate, but the prospects are insatiable.\n\nIn the night, she takes a car ride down the coastline to the estate of Lady Hideko, a grand estate built in two parts: one half designed as though an English mansion, and another half in traditional Japanese style. It's truly East meets West, and the blatant metaphor of clashing cultures and ideas only becomes more potent as the story progresses.\n\nLady Hideko lives on the estate with her elderly uncle, a man who uses an ink pen so fervently that his tongue is stained black. He is a collector of antique literature and texts which are entirely erotic in nature, and uses Hideko to recite the texts to potential buyers who frequent the mansion in hopes of bidding on what is essentially pornography. We learn about her past, raised by her Uncle in a disciplinarian manner, losing her aunt to a suicide as a child, and an eternal fear of ever leaving the confines of the estate. For Sook- Hee, the innocent maid come to spy on her, it might already seem like a mental institute is not too far off.\n\nAs these two women begin to know each other, they become friendly, with Hideko using Sook-Yee to model her clothes and confine dark secrets in the privacy of her room. Sook- Yee, who sees the potential wealth she will soon inherit, seems hypnotized by the beauty of her boss, and in some of the most beautiful moments of glances and gestures, we can see a dark romance forming between the two women.\n\nThe story is broken up into three parts, and to venture in even discussing the array of twists and turns would do no favors to the structure of the story, so expertly-written and brilliant that at any one time we may have flashbacks within flashbacks told simply to act as footnote to a line of dialogue or interpret the actions of a character. Never are we lost or in over our heads; this is a masterpiece of story and style. In fact, Part 2 nearly replays the entire first act of the film but through the perspective of an entirely different character. Scenes are repeated in their entirety and yet the insight we gain only leads towards understanding of the next moment, and the next...\n\nThe movie is based on an English crime novel called \"Fingersmith,\" and we can see how this story could easily be (at first glance) a serial crime novel with a predictable plot. The story is tense at times and deeply erotic at others, showing these two women in moments of ultimate vulnerability and strength, sometimes in the same instance. I would expect many audience members to be offput by the graphic nature of several scenes, and yet I can do nothing but praise the artistic endeavors to use sex on film as a means to tell an emotional story.\n\nThe Academy Awards have created a shortlist of potential nominees for Best Foreign Film, a list that does not include 'The Handmaiden' (South Korea instead nominated a film called 'The Age of Shadows'). It's a shame that a movie as wonderful as this could be looked over, even if by technicality that a country needs to pick one film only to represent it. The soundtrack is haunting, the story compelling, the look is heavenly. I know I will see many more films as the Fall rolls along, and yet I know that when I come to make a list of my favorite films of the year, this is now the one to beat."

        "review_detailed_main": "Up front, you should know that \"The Handmaiden\" is a crazy film, the work of an immensely talented -- and seriously depraved -- artist. That artist would be Park Chan-wook, the Korean director of the already- classic \"Oldboy,\" as well as the recent English-language \"Stoker.\"\n\nPark Chan-wook seems to enjoy peeling back the layers of normal people and recognizable situations until, layer by layer, things turn darker, kinkier, and infinitely more surreal than we could have imagined at the film's outset. He's very good at this. His films are tense but often funny affairs, with the pacing of thrillers. His camera lingers on beautiful images but also on acts of graphic violence, as if to juxtapose the two. He lures us in with stories which feature a simple, seductive setup -- and then reveals that nothing is what it seems.\n\nI'm not the guy's biggest fan, but I've grown to admire his films over the years. He is quite a visual artist, and his movies are often so singular -- at once immeasurably accomplished and completely inexplicable -- that their very uniqueness justifies their existence.\n\n\"The Handmaiden\" is a Gothic-romance and an erotic thriller, set in 1930s Japan-occupied Korea. A beautiful young pickpocket, Sooki, is hired by a fake Count, Fujiwara, to become the handmaiden of his rich benefactor's niece, Hideko. The rich benefactor, who is Hideko's uncle by marriage, expects to marry her soon, in order to claim her inheritance as his own -- after which, he plans to send her away to a madhouse. Fujiwara enlists Sooki to help him win Hideko's affections, so that he can essentially do the same. Nobody is who they seem to be, everybody has a hidden agenda, and when Sooki and Hideko actually seem to be falling in love, we have to wonder whether it's true, or whether they're both acting for the other's benefit?\n\nThe film is neatly divided into 3 parts. Part 1 has us thinking we've figured things out, until Part 2 revisits the same story from a different perspective, and has us questioning everything we learned in Part 1. Part 3 resolves the film.\n\nIt's a strange, twisted, beautiful ride. I honestly feel like I need to watch it a second time, in order to better understand everything that happened. It's so densely-plotted that I fear I only understand the basic outline. I'm guessing that a second time through would increase my appreciation of the film's artistry, as it did for \"Oldboy.\"\n\nCertainly worthwhile, especially for fans of Park Chan-wook's other films, and for fans of Korean cinema in general. I can't say it connected with me on much of an emotional level, but I found many scenes darkly amusing, and the intricate plot rather fascinating."

At a running time of nearly 3 hours, the film is in desperate need of editing to reduce its excesses - of which there are many. The plot is dragged on for far too long, and the voids are filled with unnecessary, protracted, over-the-top sex scenes to force sexuality into a story that it does little to benefit. While the central premise of the film (a revenge tale) is promising, it is squandered by the film's length and lack of originality. After the first twist of the film is revealed, the plot becomes increasingly predictable and offers little payoff for the viewer's time.\n\nThe acting and cinematography were well done, but wasted on a movie that offered far less than it was promised to be. In truth, this movie could have been edited down to half its running length with nothing of value lost.\n\nMy advice: 3 hours of your life are better spent on almost anything else.\n\nWE OUT HERE"

You don't spend the entire film trying to outguess it but instead are so enraptured by it that it can take you by surprise.\n\nIt's also a provocation, one that rides the line between exploitation and art quite daringly. You can justify good chunks of what happens in here, but maybe not all of it (or the extent of it). But taken as a cathartic release from the tyranny of a patriarchal society (and also the Japanese occupation of Korea, which is a subtext I won't pretend to completely understand) it is fitting and has its own brazen clarity.

This is a film best watched without much prior knowledge. The film grabs you from the first minute, and then takes you on an awe-inspiring, sensual journey of feelings and emotions as a result of its distinct unpredictability. You will be thrilled, shocked, touched and totally captivated as the story unfolds - not to mention spellbound, by the sensational visual work at play throughout. Something the director and crew clearly invested so much time and imagination into.\n\nAll in all, I give this film a 10/10 rating as I simply can not find a single fault. Bravo!"

In \"The handmaiden\" there is a library with erotic books. Once in a while a female servant of the master recites from these books for his guests. The way she puts a spell on them and brings them in a trance like state, is one of the most erotc moments in this film."

No unnatural behavior. I was completely convinced by their acting. The pace, the tense, the emotion and the atmosphere are all perfect en every chapter. From the story to screen play, everything make sense at the end. All details are part of the big puzzle. Also, the film has a spirit of the Korean and Japanese culture. The clash between the two. A story about man and woman, business and love, rational and emotional, oppress and resist. Again it reveals the power of woman. It is definitely the best Asian movie I have ever seen this year."

What do you get when the double-crossers are double-crossing each other? Triple-crossing? Then that's what it is.\n\nThe film is set in Korea during the Japanese occupation. Two women and a man are engaged in complicated shenanigans, involving gender, sexual preference, social class, nationality and even language. Each character is pretending, in order to deceive the others.\n\nIn each of the three parts, a new level of deceit is shown. Sometimes parts of the story are repeated from another angle, to show how things are slightly different from how you think they were. Confused? Don't bother to understand. It'll all become clear when you see the film.\n\nVisually, this movie is absolutely great. Each scene, even if it lasts for only a few seconds, is beautiful. The lighting, the camera angles, the costumes, the scenery, the make-up - everything is picture perfect.\n\nThe flip side is that the visual perfection takes away much spontaneity. The film is extremely stylish, perhaps even a bit too much so. But the visual bravado is not empty. There's a lot going on at each moment, and the imagery is always in line with the story itself. Only the explicit lesbian sex scenes seem to go on longer than strictly necessary - but who am I to complain?"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Japanese/Korean film Ah-ga-ssi was shown in the U.S. with the title The Handmaiden (2016). It was directed by Park Chan-wook.\n\nThis movie has been described as an erotic thriller. This is accurate, but it doesn't convey the richness and complexity of the plot. The actor Min-hee Kim plays Lady Hideko, and Tae-ri Kim portrays Sook-Hee, her new servant (handmaiden). We learn at the beginning of the film that Sook-Hee is a petty thief. She has been hired by the deceitful Count Fujiwara (Jung-woo Ha), himself a fraud, to betray Lady Hideko and encourage her to marry the count.\n\nThe film has many positive aspects--the two women actors are beautiful, the 1930's costumes are glorious, the settings and cinematography are superb. I had trouble with the plot, however. The movie is divided into three parts. Apparently, parts one and two convey the same story, but from different perspectives. Part three brings the plot to its conclusion. (I didn't understand this when I saw the movie--I learned it from reading what was written by other reviewers.)\n\nThe movie would be rated R in the U.S. Lots of sexuality and flesh, but nothing that would earn it an X. Some reviewers found the sexual scenes gratuitous, but I thought that they were important, and well integrated into the film.\n\nAs I write this review, The Handmaiden has an incredible 8.1 IMDb rating. I believe that the film is worth seeing, but I don't think it's quite at that level.\n\nWe saw the movie at Rochester's wonderful Little Theatre. On one weekend in mid-December 2016, there were three films with IMDb ratings over 8 showing on The Little's five screens! If you live in Upstate New York, The Little is worth a special trip. For example, we saw The Handmaiden and Manchester by the Sea as a matin\u00e9e double feature. It's an hour drive for us, but I would drive two hours if necessary to see such excellent movies at the same theater. Think about it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Non-English movie trailers will sometimes go very far out of their way to hide the fact that their film isn't in English. The trailer for Park Chan-wook's latest film, The Handmaiden, follows this tradition, and is incomprehensible as a result. It is, however, one of the most striking trailers of the year, and promises a pretty visually distinct piece of film. I'm happy to say that, while The Handmaiden is not what I expected based on the trailer alone, it lives up to that promise, marrying arresting film-making with a twisty narrative.\n\nPark Chan-wook's films, in a way, feel like a distant cousin of Quentin Tarantino's (who championed his breakout, Oldboy). The Handmaiden at it's best contains similar stylistic touches, such as denoted act breaks and nonlinear narratives, and it's plot certainly has a lot in common with Western con movies. Effectively, the movie concerns itself with the relationship between three characters in 1930s Japan- occupied Korea: wealthy isolated heiress Hideko, grifter posing-as-noble Fujiwara, and petty thief turned handmaid Sook-hee. Fujiwara enlists Sook-hee to be his eyes and ears as he tries to marry Hideko from under her abusive uncle's nose, but Sook-hee and Hideko soon find themselves drawn more towards each other. It's fun to watch it all unfold, although those expecting a mind-blowing twist in the vein of Oldboy may be let down; while the movie is quite far from traditional, its plot machinations are fairly traditional (although very engaging).\n\nWhat pushes the film up quite a bit is Park's style. Most of the film takes place in Hideko's mansion, which crosses English and Japanese architecture much like Park wears his English and Asian filmmaking influences on his sleeve. The movie threatens to be a haunted house flick briefly, and many times evokes Park's early Gothic drama Stoker. But Park and production designer Ryu Seong-hee give the film a vibe of its own, selling the oppressive opulence of Hideko's life. Moments of pitch-black humour help to cut the tension effectively, including the best noose gag ever filmed. Where Park's instincts falter a bit is when it seemingly exploits the Sook- hee/Hideko relationship for pure titillation value. To its credit, even the exploitation isn't without thematic relevance; a subset of characters in the movie are connoisseurs of artful smut, and the closing moments cement the idea that Park set out to make exactly that. But the narration and interaction sells the attraction between the two well enough, which leaves the explicit scenes feeling a bit superfluous.\n\nEven if a bit exploitative, The Handmaiden is a sharp, stylistic, and engaging piece of liar's fiction. It successfully creates a universe of its own and fills it with memorable images, characters, and moments. It has plenty of bite, but also an underlying sweetness that's a bit surprising from Park. I can't wait to watch it again."

        "review_detailed_main": "A loose adaptation of 'Fingersmith' by Sarah Waters, Park Chan-wook's 'The Handmaiden (2016)' is a layered and subversive thriller that very much feels like a novel brought to life. It's a film that knows exactly how to handle its audience, revealing only what it needs to for the current status-quo to be compelling. Its twists and turns come at the exact right moments, leading to a satisfyingly unpredictable experience that only gets deeper with each new revelation. The subject matter is darker than you might initially imagine; it deals with themes of domestic imprisonment, abuse, grooming and pre-video-tape pornography. It's also, even at its core, a romance. The relationship that blossoms between the eponymous handmaiden and her originally eponymous lady (the Korean release is named after the latter) is what fuels the narrative. Much has been made of their graphic yet restrained (though still very 'movie') sex scenes, but it's their budding sensuality and genuine connection that makes the pair believable. They're good, somewhat understated characters that keep you invested in the picture. This adds a layer of emotional resonance to the otherwise plot-heavy affair. The flick just grips you and doesn't let go. It has a palpable texture to it and it takes you on an unexpected journey. It's one of Park's best efforts. 8/10"

I honestly cannot wait to see his previous films because The Handmaiden was awesome.\n\nThe Handmaiden shows a woman who is hired to be a handmaiden to a heiress but is secretly there to defraud her.\n\nJust the story alone is why I think people should check out The Handmaiden. The film's narrative goes back and forth a couple of times and the way Park Chan-wook uses this to his advantage is incredible. The film led me to believe one thing was happening but then it revealed something else happening at the same time and it's these twists and turns which made the film so fun to watch and everything was built up extremely well. The twists revealed a different side of each character, kept the film suspenseful and it didn't feel forced at any given moment. The entire story was so well thought out that I found it incredibly hard to find a flaw in it.\n\nApart from the story, the technical craft is outstanding. The production design is terrific and the colours of the films are great. I really loved the score and overall music. The cinematography and direction were sublime and the pacing was really good. It's over 2 hours long but it never felt that way because of how interesting the story and characters were. The two lead actresses (Min-hee Kim and Tae-ri Kim) had to do a lot of demanding stuff but they both were fantastic. Jung-woo Ha and Jin-woong Cho also gave really great performances.\n\nPark Chan-wook's twisted, sexy and suspenseful story is must watch. The only thing I didn't like was an editing choice made during the end of the film. I don't understand why a choice like that was made but apart from that everything else about The Handmaiden is truly phenomenal. Definitely give it a watch."

In addition to talking about topics such as sexualization, ambition, greed, manipulation, ethnic strife, violence and psychological torture in a playful but raw.\n\nThe highlight of the film in the first moment is its script, however, we have here a great soundtrack, optimistic and sad at the same time, which complements the void that each character has, plus a clear and beautiful photograph that contrasts with internal angles cold and colorless, causing caustrophobia. The photograph of the film speaks with its shooting angles, innocence and perversity intertwine with a macabre beauty, the sex scenes are extremely well filmed, intimate and irrational, that are at the same level of their scenes violent and cruel, psychologically and physically . With some planes sequences and angles open, its direction is beautiful.\n\nIn addition, we have great costumes, composition of scenes, makeup and sound, \"The maid\" is a complete film.\n\n\"The maid\" is not perfect, but flirts with perfection, aesthetics and technique, we have a great movie, full of feelings and symbologies. 9/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Handmaiden\" is a deeply romantic story full of erotic tension, but also a highly intelligent thriller. It is told in three parts, with countless conspiracies and turns. Everything that you think you know, will turn out in an unexpected way.\n\nBut not only the story convinced me. The visuals are outstanding and the general look of the film is close to perfection. That is cinematography at its best. The music of the film is fitting and contributes to the great atmosphere.\n\nThe only weakness of this movie are its overacted and sometimes silly male characters. But the main focus lies on the two female protagonists, who are convincing.\n\nFor me, this film is a must-watch for fans of Asian cinema and everyone else, who is into new exciting ways to tell great stories on the big screen."

        "review_detailed_main": "As an unconditional Park Chan-wook fan i was very eager to see the Handmaiden and i was not disappointed. It tells a story of a maid who agrees (alongside a con artist) to work for a young woman who is about to inherit a substancional amount of money and at the same time brainwash her to marry the con artist so he can put the young woman in a mental facility and get the fortune for himself, and a small portion of money for the maid of course. But the plan goes sour when the maid starts to develop feelings for the young woman and regrets what she's doing to her. It's a wonderful movie, but when the second part of the story starts its when things really begin to heat up and then you can clearly see that this is truly a Park Chan-Wook film that it's not far from he's master piece \"vengeance trilogy\". Without spoil ling to anyone the ending myth surprise some of the die-hard fans of Park's early work because it's a different end from the rest of he's movies, but don't get me wrong it's a perfect end it's just a 180\u00ba from what i was expecting. And a final word for the performances, i was not familiar with particular actors but they all delivered."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm a huge fan of Chan-Wook Park's work. I've seen them all and been an avid follower for years, and this one doesn't disappoint.\n\nIt's a complicated layered story of con artists and deviants, but there are many aspects to it all. There's humour, scares, romance, eroticism and suspense. Lots of twists add up to make a film that really you don't know what to expect next with. It's excellent.\n\nIt's all shot brilliantly in Chan-Wook Park's philosophical style. Each shot is picturesque. It's wonderful to look at, the music is wonderful and the storyline is engrossing.\n\nThe motley crue of characters have some great depth to them that you are just intrigued. I've just watched the extended version, so I'm reviewing that here. It's very graphic sexually so be careful on taking a date to this film.\n\nIf you're liberally-minded, then you'll really enjoy this. It's erotic and sometimes crude, but never really offensive. It is actually also a criticism of certain forms of sexual abusive behaviour, and that's intriguing.\n\nIt's a wonderful film, and another in what is marking the director to be amongst the finest directors I've ever encountered. I can't recommend his work highly enough. Give it a try."

Early on we see a wealthy man living in an opulent mansion who is corrupt in that he forges books to sell and wants to marry his niece for her inheritance, and a couple of grifters who want to swindle him in a cruel way that will leave the niece in a madhouse. There is some real darkness here, and this is just the start of it. The film is 145 minutes long but the production value is so high that the time seemed to fly by. It was almost ruined by director Park Chan-wook not exercising the slightest bit of restraint during the sex scenes; it goes from sweet seduction and lesbian empowerment to exploitative soft-core porn as he holds the camera/male gaze on the young actors for far longer than was necessary on more than one occasion. To me it was far steamier in the scenes of glances and small touches, though I know I sound hopelessly old-fashioned saying that. Still though, this was a damn good film."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's rare that I can watch a movie this long in one go. Obligingly it divides itself into three distinct acts that serve as convenient check points so you really feel the progress being made.\n\nDoes it justify its runtime? It really is an epic story, not in the sense that it spans any great amount of space or time but in how it shows with great ambition and attention to detail, explores a complex and enigmatic relationship, that is for both its participants a testing of the limits of gender, sexuality, ethnicity and economic class.\n\nA sensual and atmospheric evocation of a particular time and place where two cultures live uneasily side by side, there is plenty of the Korea/Japanophiles to jack off over except there is an irony to it presentation of ostentatious culture and refinement; showing the dark side to the beautiful and that deeper vision that lies beyond the patriarchal gaze. (I woke up this morning in a pretentious mood).\n\nThe non-linear narrative structure presents us with mystery and intrigue regarding its central conflict, where less and less is exactly what it seems and we are treated to an impressive bout of story telling and misdirection in this tale of hidden identity and self discovery as well as characterisation and thoughtfulness.\n\nVery visually beautiful with a lyrical surface belying the bitter core, in which even the whether are not immune from this world of alienation and loneliness.\n\nA serious movie, but with a sense of humor when it needs it. A love story of sorts, but thankfully that kind in which the relationship is a tool to explore the characters rather than the other way around.\n\nMy only real issue is that it is not exactly cogent what the plan is even when we're supposed to know.\n\nNot a movie to watch casually, but give this movie the commitment it requires and it will pay you back in spades."

        "review_detailed_main": "This review of The Handmaiden is spoiler free\n\n***** (5/5)\n\nIT'S OFTEN DIFFICULT to imagine the thoughts of a big-name filmmaker such as Park Chan-wook. He's optimistic to say the least, and this has lead him to become a Korean cinema mastermind, just by a few films that have shocked audiences all over the world, he's been called a genius. It's given his films a particular high-standard, whether they're thrillers, Oldboy or whether it's a sexy vampire story, Thirst. He's good at thrilling his audience no matter the genre.\n\nHis previous film, Stoker, his English-language debut and his first foray into Hollywood, went beyond all that; he added a new feature by going beyond the mark with sexual content. It had a scene where Mia Wasikowska's burgeoning villain, masturbated joyfully after the assassination of her attempted rapist. That was sex on a smaller scale; his latest The Handmaiden involves that scene on a much larger scale, think Blue Is The Warmest Colour, that's this film in a nutshell. Inspired by Sarah Waters' crime novel Fingersmith, this powerful Byzantine-esque tale is a picturesque journey of a lowly pickpocket who is employed by a powerful Seoul con-man to defraud a wealthy Japanese heiress out of her money, during the Japanese occupation of Korea in the 1930s.\n\nIt's a voluptuously stunning tale of love, sex, violence, and vengeance, at 2 hours an 24 minutes it is a slightly episodic endeavour of vengeance but it's gorgeous every scene from inside the mansion or outside in the gardens is presented like the number one painting exhibit at The Louvre, even the luridly mesmerizing intimate times are like a painting, thanks to Chung Chung-hoo's cinematography. Told over three chapters, each set with a purpose, which most of the time ends up with somebody getting hurt it's an irresistible tale of wonder and joy. We open with Sook-hee (Kim Tae-ri) a young pickpocket who is employed by a con-man, Count Fujiwara (Ha Jung-woo) to work for a wealthy Japanese heiress, Lady Hideko (Kim Min-hee) as a handmaiden, while he tries to seduce her into marriage. But it later transpires that Count Fujiwara isn't the man who he says he is, he's self-indulgent in many ways and also he plans to put young Sook-hee in jail for thievery. She, however, has different plans she starts to fall in love with Hideko, and as their love gets stronger to a point she's then taken away.\n\nAt which point she forms an elaborate plan for vengeance, it's a while before this plan comes to play and when it does Chan-wook isn't afraid to steer away from the material. He presents himself as a cinematic thesp by creating his characters around turmoil, pain, suffering and emotion. The film is fiery at this point getting faster as every minute is an irresistible moment, towards vengeance. Meanwhile, intercutting flashbacks of Hideko's life growing up with her narcissistic uncle and her insane auntie and how they taught her to read erotica with proper diction around an audience of perverted elderly men. Sure it's a perverse moment, but it's still equally mesmerizing there are plenty of those moments that evolve this film and each one is better than the last. In addition, it's frankly sexual, horrifically violent, and voluptuously stunning.\n\nWhen the final thrill comes to play it shows that Sook-hee has planned her moment of shine well, it's a non-bullsh*t thrill which involves a lot of pain, a giant octopus on the wall, pollution from smoking and ultimately a stunning shot of Sook-hee and Hideko tearing up a studio in the home. This is lifted with perfect execution, it's almost too hard to look away from beauty of love (which is the message this film gives). The Handmaiden is sybaritic yet luridly mesmerizing down to its final moments that are executed perfectly, it's a joy. It's Chan-wook's best film in years that will stand the test of time.\n\nVERDICT: A part Oldboy, a bit like Stoker with a part Blue Is The Warmest Colour makes this is a cinematic masterpiece of the ages."

Using smaller side plots, twists and emotions that act as release valves throughout the film rather than a final release of tension is something this film does. While this looks all too nice at first, it puts the pace of the story in an awkward position when there is no final kick to end it all. The visuals were good but at most scenes they weren't that special. Really liked how the director told us the story in a way that it moved on our reactions. While this is good for the first couple of twists and turns, it hinders the story when the audience gets tired on the long run. The whole film felt more like an American Classic, like the Great Gatsby, in its Storytelling rather than a Japanese drama at first but it slowly turned sour as the story commenced. The whole love and death theme was also well-done. The most highly noticeable thing that I don't like is probably the timing of the themes. In this matter, some are underdone and raw while others are overdone and burnt. This is caused by the far too many turns arcs in the story. Good watch overall."

Another barrier is the heiress' evil uncle (Cho Jin-woong) who has dominated her for many years. The film is based on the novel \"Fingersmith\" by Sarah Waters and updates the story from Victorian England to Japanese-occupied Korea in the early 20thcentury.\n\nThere are various plot twists to keep this movie intriguing throughout. The first two (of three) parts are the same narrative while the second is more of a revision of the first with a different perspective. These are the best parts of the film.\n\nThe third part wraps things up well enough but with some difficult violent scenes. Also, at the risk of giving away a spoiler, the story has too many resemblances to the superb American indie film / lesbian love story \"Bound\" (1996).\n\nIn addition to \"Bound\", \"The Handmaiden\" takes cues from another more recent lesbian love story \"Blue is the Warmest Colour\" from France. Both films had sex scenes between two women that began as erotic but ended by being (or at least bordering on) pornographic. The less-is-more approach would have been more effective.\n\nOverall though, director Park Chan-wook has crafted a fine film with a fine mix of great performances and stunning photography, settings, and music. The two and a half hours go by with the viewer's full attention."

        "review_detailed_main": "South Korea has produced some of the world's most creative and exciting works of cinema since the century began, and Park Chan-wook (of \"Oldboy\" and \"Thirst\" fame) is one of its most acclaimed filmmakers. Still, knowing that, nothing prepared me for \"The Handmaiden\", unquestionably Park's masterpiece to date, and even perhaps the finest film to ever come out of that country.\n\nBorn and raised in Seoul, Park was determined to be an art critic until his first viewing of Alfred Hitchcock's \"Vertigo\" which dictated the rest of his life. In 2013, Park actually made a twisted, stylized loose remake of Hitchcock's \"Shadow of a Doubt' (called \"Stoker\" with Nicole Kidman, his only English language film) but whereas that movie was somewhat inconsistent albeit visually lush, \"The Handmaiden\" is perfectly realized, the framing of every shot and the rhythm of its pacing fully controlled in structure and tone, and executed with such an exquisite sense of visual beauty in its production design, costumes and cinematography (as well as the aesthetic beauty of its cast) that virtually every frame of this film could be hung on the wall of an art museum.\n\nAdapted from Fingersmith, a Welsh novel by Sarah Waters, the film is set in the Japan-occupied South Korea of the 1930s as if its characters and setting had been lifted out of Henry James' Victorian England. Divided into a three-part structure, it tells of a handmaiden hired to a young Japanese heiress who lives a secluded life on a large Dickensian estate with her dominating Uncle -- but the intricate plot that develops has more twists than a Philadelphia pretzel, with scheming and swindling, double-crossings and betrayal, as well as explicit lesbian sex (and a small dose of shocking violence). What makes it all so engrossing is the three-part construct which allows its events to double back on themselves (a la Quentin Tarantino), keeping viewers constantly off balance as new twists become slowly revealed like layers falling off in the peeling of an onion. All of this is in the service of a high class, richly poetic work of cinematic art, one that is as intelligent and sophisticated as it is intense and erotic, a film displaying no less than the most gorgeous images of the year in cinema. Not to be missed.\n\n(One added note: I was lucky enough to view a special extended director's cut of this film in an art cinema which ran 167 minutes, adding 23 minutes to the theatrical 144-minute version. Although much of the additional footage was of totally explicit sexual activity, these scenes were shot with such taste and poetic beauty that it was never exploitative or offensive, to this viewer anyway. Both cuts are equally recommended -- the regular theatrical version more of a thriller; the longer one more of a romance.)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Subverting the trope of feminine subservience and the male gaze, Park Chan-Wook's latest thriller is fiercely anti-patriarchal. Inspired from Sarah Waters' contemporary romance novel set in Victorian-era Britain, Park transports his story to 1930's Japanese-occupied Korea. Parallels can be seen between subjugation of women by men and that of Korea by Japan; clash of culture, class and identity. It exposes and condemns the bare-faced misogyny brought upon by class and culture. Being a tale about deception, Park makes sure that we are one of its casualties as well (through its efficient narrative structure); nothing is as it seems. I repeat, 'Nothing'. Each of the four main characters are pursuing a vision of freedom that can be achieved only through a lie; the story explores the tension between the authentic self and the facade that individuals create, and that society imposes from without.\n\nThe tradition of men eroticising the female body (and even lesbian sex) for their own personal fantasies has existed for ages now - whether it's books, films, paintings, manga, any kind of art - and pornography in general (shunga is referenced in the film); Park highlights this, then lets the female protagonists explore their sexuality for their own pleasure, not anyone else's. One wouldn't have expected Mr. Park, known for his exquisite revenge thrillers, would give us the best romance film of the year (not to say this isn't a revenge thriller as well). It's essentially the story of two women who are victims of their circumstances and finally find solace in each other. The female characters may appear duplicitous, but actually, they subvert the expectations of the people around who constantly underestimate their wit and sexuality.\n\nThe gorgeous visuals, the compulsive attention to detail and crisp editing get you hooked from the very first scene. Loved the efficient and subtle use of humour at apt instances; absurdist humour underlines even the most tragic and violent moments. The casting couldn't have been better; both the actresses are stunning, and captivating in their performances. Their characters are so thoroughly developed, and the sex scenes are highly erotic and sensual. Park masterfully constructs his narrative, dividing the film into three segments, each with its own narrator, sub plot and con. Even when previous moments are visited, they are done from a different angle or vantage point, thus altering our perspective literally. I love how the film's climax literally ends with a climax, with the two women reveling in the silly freedom of acting out a pornographic clich\u00e9 mentioned earlier in the film. Ultimately, the movie is about embracing one's true self, and the liberation of mind and body. It's Park's most uplifting film yet."

        "review_detailed_main": "I try not to use that word, it's rather overused for films that just aren't masterpieces. But when a film is so gorgeous that it imitates art, so multi-dimensional that it transcends the majority of narratives and so daring that it tests the limitations of film itself...I can't help but call it a masterpiece. A rich Japanese lady recruits a handmaiden who soon turns out to be a swindler, tasked with falsifying a wedding in order to steal her money. Twists and turns soon reveal many secrets that question the legitimacy of the new handmaiden's undercover task. Immediately I was hypnotised. Park Chan-Wook has such an eye for detail, every frame is lovingly crafted and resembles a jewel on a glistening necklace. Cinematography rarely looks this gorgeous, honestly. The visceral imagery conveys multiple themes of lust, greed, jealousy...in fact, nearly all the seven deadly sins are thematically interwoven in this complex narrative. Chan-Wook played me like a puppet. Manipulating my mind with every unexpected twist. It's a story of how powerful love is. An emotion so overwhelming that people are moulded by its presence. The lead characters all experience this, whether it be falsifying love or truly experiencing it for the first time. How motivations for money and power can be blurred by love. It's just a work of art. It truly is. Deceive me once? I applaud you. Deceive me twice? I'm jumping up and down the room like a lunatic. Tiny intricacies that are soon explained within the narrative's three parts, these revelations blew my mind. With an everlasting haunting undertone, it just made the story all the more resonating. Even the musical score was stunning, replicating orchestral symphonies with traditional Asian instruments. I will say it's an 18 for a reason, the sexual nature is extremely explicit yet it doesn't detract from the seamless story. Asian cinema has yet again proven that it's better than Hollywood. The Handmaiden, easily, acquires the perfect rating."

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie starts with a young Korean girl leaving her family to go to be a servant in a Japanese household. The visuals, the language, the mood, they are all so Asian. The eroticism is so pronounced even from the start, so different from the sanitized Anglo-Saxon media, too. So I was quite amazed to hear that this is an adaptation of a British Novel called Fingersmith. The adaptation is great, though.\n\nI can't say much about the story without spoiling it, but it is split into three parts, each from a different viewpoint, showing you that things are far from straightforward. It's basically a thriller noir, only set in 1930's Japanese occupied Korea. I liked the acting, the sets, the story, but what put them all into perspective was the way it was all presented. The non linear way of storytelling really made this a fresh and interesting film.\n\nBottom line: a very beautiful Asian adaptation of a British novel that should be easily accessible to both Eastern and Western audiences."

        "review_title": "A Feminist, empowering, sexy love story, told in a most creative and thrilling way.",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Handmaiden\" by Park Chan-wook is a very feminist film (though it may not identify as such) that unearths a morbose, and sado-misogynistic world of literary pornography, as well as a culture of women subjugated to read these books out loud to gatherings of wealthy older men. It is a story of trickery, scamming, and conning. It is a story of power, dominance, and control. It is a story of ritual, customs and twisted desires. But, above all things, this movie is a beautiful and empowering love-story.\n\nMuch like Kurosawa's \"Rashomon\" Chan-Wook's film creates powerful suspense and tension through its multiple perspective story-telling; allowing the viewer to slowly piece together a narrative puzzle (as each character recounts their experience), revealing bits of information that unravel the truth about the chain of events that occur. Divided into 3 Parts (not to be confused with Acts), the different Points of Views serve as a witty story-telling trope that plays out beautifully and seamlessly in \"The Handmaiden.\"\n\nWhile it has the unapologetic perversion of Pasolini's \"Salo:120 Days of Sodom\" Chan- Wook has a sense of (dark) humor throughout his film. Telling a compelling, somewhat-stylized, and dark story but without taking itself too seriously; provoking moments of laughter despite the discomfort, the beauty, the perversion, the seduction. We are not only seduced by what is unveiled, but Chan-Wook also seduces us with lavish sets, luxurious costumes, and beautiful scenery, as well as meticulous directing, and gorgeous cinematography. The love-story and the tension that the Director is able to build between the two leading female characters is reminiscent of the forbidden love between Mrs Chan and Chow Mo-wan in Won Kar Wai's \"In the Mood for Love;\" generating tension and density in the air by controlling and denying us (the viewer) of our desires and expectations. By not allowing love to consummate when we most wish it to. And, although I have not actually seen \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" (and nor is it on my \"Must Watch\" Movie list), I imagine \"The Handmaiden\" also shares similar thematic elements with the E.L. James franchise.\n\nMuch like the 2013 Cannes favorite, Abdellatif Kechiche's \"Blue is the Warmest Color,\" Chan-Wook's film also shows graphic sexual encounters between two beautiful women (and runs about 3 hours long), but unlike Kechiche's film which indulges in woman-on-woman sex through a very accentuated self-centered, male-gaze, \"The Handmaiden\" on the contrary, is a very empowering story about two bad-ass women who--despite the sedimented patriarchal world they inhabit-- are able to break away, find love, express themselves sexually (in a very tasteful, romantic, at times humorous, and tender ways); and outsmart the ego-centric, sex-obsessed, wealth- obsessed men.\n\nChan-Wook is very smart in the way he shows us grossly perverse \"acts\" performed for the amusement of men, and under the control of men; and the same act later reclaimed by the leading females and turned into an act of pleasure for themselves, and for each other. A very beautiful, current, and empowering love-story told in a most creative and thrilling way.\n\n\"The Handmaiden\" is now added to my list of feminist films directed by progressive male filmmakers. Sure, Chan-Wook is a male Director, and by default, it's impossible for the story not to have \"a bit\" of a male gaze, since it is a man literally standing behind the lens and looking through it; however the film is quite feminist. Like Rivettes' revolutionary \"Julie and Celine go Boating\" and Eric Rohmer's \"La Collectionneuse\" and \"Claire's Knee\" as well as Truffaut's \"Jules et Jim\" really progressive feminist films made by male filmmakers. Much like the aforementioned auteurs, Park Chan-Wook has managed to deal with sexuality, misogyny, and power from a very feminist perspective. Unapologetically and refreshingly empowering."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is about Sook-Hee, a pickpocket who gets a chance to make fortune by helping a con man seduce a heiress, Lady Hideko, as her maid. This movie covers the Sook-Hee dilemma after getting along with Lady Hideko, Lady Hideko's past and her struggles with her uncle, twists and turns in the con man's plan.\n\nThis movie is an erotic thriller with an intriguing plot and presented in kind of a rashomon effect. The movie captured my attention from the start as it created expectations of what would happen. The movie is well written as the time passes by without any boredom or distractions. As the relationship between Sook-Hee and Lady Hideko grows, it helps the major twist in Part 1 of the movie. Retelling the story from Lady Hideko's perspective reveals more of the story and state of her uncle, her childhood, and the estate she lives in.\n\nI can say that the 3 parts of this movie act as a three-act structure of a film. Sex literature plays an important role in this story as the characters meet, suffer, love, and profit from it throughout the movie. The only drawback in the movie is at the climax, as it is stretched longer than required. As I watched the extended edition of this movie, I was intrigued most of the time.\n\nThe actors did a good job as they expressed the emotions of their characters as the scenes required in the movie. Park Chan-wook delivered another fabulous movie. The cinematography and shot composition were great, as were the landscapes, and the frames looked great throughout the movie.\n\nIn conclusion, I like this movie. I would suggest watching this movie. It's strictly an 18+ movie."

Pacing is absolutely brilliant, especially for such along movie. Actors are unknown in the west, but they did an amazing job here. They also used a lot of sex scenes, which was fitting to the story. Those were extremly good performed.\n\nI have the feeling that we won't see such amovie ever again in Hollywood, their time is just over. Speaking of all the political ideologies of modern movies. But that's not the viewers problem because luckily we have guys like Chan-wook Park who still know how to make entertaining movies.\n\nI can recommend you this film without any limitations.

So much of this film is simply exquisite from the electrifying interaction between the two leads to the beautiful cinematography, costumes and score, and the film unfolds like a beautiful butterfly in Part Two. There is one brief gory scene in part 3 which jarred somewhat with the rest of the film but overall this production is a delight for all the senses and you are left thinking that you have seen a superbly delivered and unique piece of cinema."

        "review_detailed_main": "A con story gone wild, that's another way to summarize what The Handmaiden is about. In between these two short formulas, there's a story no description would be able to do proper justice. It would defy your expectations and keep you puzzled about what's actually going on and what's to happen next. This ability to surprise is The Handmaiden's most undeniable quality, and that alone makes this film worth watching.\n\nThere's, however, a certain \"anime\" flavor to this story. No, not in the sense that the characters have disproportionately big eyes or hyperbolized emotions. The characters' emotions here are pretty well-explained, but the events that cause them are often contrived beyond any rational explanation. Especially when it comes to people's greed, violence and perversion. As if the film tries to take us aback by flummoxing and mesmerizing us with its explicit and graphic nature, so that we obediently submit ourselves to its cinematographic will.\n\nBut while the entourage of this story, taking place in Korea during the Japanese occupation, is indeed captivating and colorful, there's a certain \"modern replica\" feeling about it. And not just because it is inspired by a book released in 2002 but whose events take place in Victorian Era England. It's the whole concept of womanly love that can be vicious and cruel to conquer all, something that our society found a taste for only recently. This concept has everything in it to haunt our minds and become a true icon of our generation, but with The Handmaiden it felt neither entirely fresh nor entirely genuine. The world already has Blue is the Warmest Color and Gone Girl. If not for them, The Handmaiden might have been groundbreaking. But now, it feels too much like those two stories intermixed, with an octopus added for a graphic effect. To a stimulated bidder, this book could still be sold high. But it still doesn't make up for a difference between an original and an artfully crafted fake."

It's more suspense, mystery, lesbian drama.\n\nIn fact, I haven't seen this much graphic lesbian sex in my life. I'm no prude, but girl-on-girl action isn't my forte, so it's not on my top ten porn searches. But, if you're into that, you might be pleased when it shows up several times in the film.\n\nThe movie revolves around a rich heiress who's woo'd by a scheming Count and his Maid-to-Be to get her fortune. She's somehow set to marry her uncle, but the Count's got other plans for her cash. Only, his decoy, the film's title, has other plans.\n\nWhile I had to start/stop this several times, it's highly recommended as it's beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, scored excellently and the twists just keep on coming that makes the whole experience worth it. Yes, it's overlong and could've been severely cut, but it pays off and in the most satisfying way. Definitely check out this Handmaiden.\n\n***\n\nFinal thoughts: Helps I have a thing for Asians and this serves both my Japanese and Korean love. Granted only one real male is predominate, he is quite the catch throughout. Luckily, I can concentrate on him while they make me watch so many naked females make love."

The very existence of Park Chan-Wook's \"The Handmaiden\" is inexplicable. It features a lesbian love triangle set during the Japanese colonial rule of Korea. It is based on Sarah Waters' Victorian era novel \"Fingersmith\", but almost a third of the movie varies from its source. It keeps the best stuff about a great novel and reaches new heights.\n\nThe movie tells of a female pickpocket (Kim Tae-ri) who conspires with a male con artist (Ha Jung-woo) to pose as a maid to a rich young heiress (Kim Min-hee) in an attempt to seize her wealth. But the story gets complicated when the maid and the heiress fall in love. The movie is filled with twists and turns. Every character has a hidden agenda. Trying to keep pace with the plot was the some of the most fun I've had while watching a movie.\n\nThe blossoming affair between the two women is observed not only through startlingly blunt and lavish sex scenes, but also through tender scenes like where one woman rushes to the other's defence. The romantic relationship between the two women opens up all sorts of emotions in the story than a more traditional film. When the two female lead characters fall in love, movie also becomes about love showing them how the men in their lives use and abuse them. In \"The Handmaiden\", love doesn't just make you feel great \u2014 it also completely reorients your perspective.\n\nThe film's narration is intriguingly constructed. It reminded me of Christopher Nolan's work. During the second half of the film, the director rewinds the scenes and plays them again from fresh vantage points, thus altering their meaning or revealing previously unknown facts.\n\nThe casting of the movie is perfect. The melodramatic performances are perfect. The cinematography, the production design and the score are perfect. The direction is perfect. Every frame, every movement of the camera, every performance feels perfectly calibrated for maximum effect.\n\n\"The Handmaiden\" is sensuously sumptuous, frankly sexual, occasionally perverse and ghastly violent. Park Chan-Wook has reached a new zenith with this movie - which is, to be honest, pure seduction. Don't. Miss. It."

The craftsmanship involved in making this movie makes it extremely effortless for the audience to enjoy the plot. One element that I enjoyed the most was the movie's pacing; Chan-wook's direction for the movie was a genius move. The movie is divided into three acts; the transitions from one style to the next was well thought of, everything was smooth.\n\nWith that being said, It's not a movie for everyone. It's an erotic thriller with a dark humor sprinkled on top but Chan-wook balances those so well that it prevents the audience from being too distracted. Even when using the words erotica and thriller to describe the movie, it is in no doubt that this was crafted and executed so well that it is such an aesthetically pleasing movie to me. Some parts of the movie might be a little too much for some people but for myself, I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen for two and a half hours."

I only seen a few seconds of the trailer but stopped the trailer so not to ruin it for myself.\n\nI loved the story, suspense and twists at the end of each part. It was also very funny in some scenes. I was also impressed at how beautiful the cinematography. Having an OLED TV and watching hundreds of films on it, not many films are mastered well in HDR. I can probably name 10 or 12 films after two years with an OLED TV. This film is one of them\n\nThis film really comes to life with its magnificente HDR capture. You can see ambient light brighten and dim as clouds out of camera view cover the sun. You can really see those minuet changes in ambient luminosity even in the indoor scenes lit by outdoors .\n\nThe filming set is also beautifully done and the camera composition impeccable. Forgive me for being a photography geek, but I really do appreciate these small technical details in films\n\nI watched this film on Amazon Prime, but unfortunately Amazon added large subtitles baked into the picture. I normally have user defined subtitles that hand below the bottom black bars so not to obscure the picture. I would love to watch this film again in DolbyVision HDR without the hard subtitles."

He wants to win her over for a plan he is preparing for several years now. His goal is to get the fortune of the young Hideko (Kim Min-hee). This young lady has been kept by her uncle since her childhood at the stately home of her aunt (who hanged herself), and forced to give readings for her uncle and other wealthy gentlemen from the gigantic collection of erotic books that are the uncle's pride and joy. Fujiwara will offer himself to the uncle as a forger (as he does not like to give away the original books, he has them copied and sells the copies instead). Sook-hee is to become the new maid of the high lady and convince her to run away with Fujiwara. After the wedding he will claim Hideko's money and lock her up in an insane asylum himself, Sook-hee gets a share of the fortune won. At first, everything seems to work out well until Sook-hee becomes attracted to her victim, and it seems to be mutual ...\n\nAfter the 2005 BBC TV series, The Handmaiden is already the second film adaptation of Sarah Waters' novel Fingersmith. Director Park Chan-wook takes his own approach, however, and so his film is significantly different from the ten-year older series; to the extent that Sarah Waters, who read the script, asked him to write that his film was only \" inspired\" by her novel.\n\nA still rather marginal but nonetheless important contrast is the historical setting. Originally, the book (and the series) was set in 19th century Victorian England. Moving it to 1930s Korea not only makes the decadence of the uncle and his erotic book collection seem even greater than it already did in the original, but it also highlights social class differences a bit more (everything Korean was considered ugly and dull to many wealthy Koreans back then, everything Japanese glorious and worthy of imitation).\n\nGo to bestlesbianmoviesever dot com for the rest of the review."

It takes the best aspects of your favorite films and directors and puts it into a deliciously show stopping package. It is the sharp societal commentary of Parasite. The creativity and absurdity of Oldboy. The fun of Tarantino. The shock of a Fincher film.\n\nThe film is shot gorgeously. The cinematographer had an absolute field day putting the shots together for this. The set design is immaculate. The writing is witty but easy to follow for someone reading subtitles. The colors of the film are a little uninspired but particular scenes looked absolutely fantastical.\n\nWithout spoiling the plot of the film, I will say that the plot is mostly classical, although the execution is masterpiece level creative. It is an absolute joy to watch even when the next 10 minutes are spelled out for you.\n\nThe pacing is fantastic, although the film slows down significantly just after the halfway point. This isn't necessarily a problem, as this lowered momentum is used as set up time for the closing act.\n\nIf nothing else, this film has some ICON scenes that took me straight to my core. These are scenes like \"luke, I am your father\" or the end of the usual suspects which make us love cinema.\n\nPark has shown that he is one of the greatest in the world at his craft."

Then I've went through some reviews over IMDb and amazed to see it's praise among the audiences which dragged me here to watch this movie.\n\nThis movie is basically divided into 3 parts. Part-1 is pretty simple and damn easy to understand. Being an non-Korean or non-Japanese viewer I was little bit confused in it's 2nd half's timeline, then I catched up whole plot of 2nd half within 10-15mins & Final part-3 is just redemption of this whole storyline. And I'll say You'll just love it's part-3 especially it's climax, because it was ended superbly.\n\nI will definitely praise the cinematographer for delivering us such a brilliant masterpiece videography in front of our screen. The Background Music director also did splendid job here. I felt like I was watching an Opera kind of stuff, Juz Kiddin'. Every character did justice to their characters, I mean no complains in Acting part. The screenplay was also perfect and properly edited as well.\n\nI will Go with 7 Out of 10 Stars for this movie, because I liked this offbeat content. It have some fully s*xually explicit scenes with hell lot of direct violences as well,so definitely not at all suitable for family audiences. But if you belongs to 18+ category then you can go for it. Just a free tip- It may taste patience of some masala movie watchers! But if they hook with it then they'll taste the essence of this movie."

The Handmaiden was an extremely unique and beautiful movie. The cinematography, visuals, sounds, everything was just as it was meant to be - gorgeous and amazing, or sickening and disgusting, depending on the scene. The 'lady' and the 'handmaiden' were both extraordinarily beautiful and unique. In other words, it was hard to take your eyes and ears off this film It was just stunning.\n\nI loved the twisting and turning, it kept everything exciting and guessing up until the end....the allegiances, who was in love, who was in lust, it was fun.\n\nThis is just a personal downside, but I'm just not a huge romance or erotica fan, and there were a lot of drawn out scenes that made the movie a bit too long in my opinion. I'm not a prude, I just find it boring. If that had been pared down I would have given it 10 stars!"

A very good BBC adaption of this was filmed in 2002 with Sally Hawkins and Elaine Cassidy. This version does reframe the story beautifully within a Korean/Japanese cultural framework and this brings a lot to the tale. Recommended."

But even with these excellent films I can always find a spot that doesn't quite sit right with me. With The Handmaiden, it is perfect; every frame handcrafted to perfection. Even with 4min of explicit sex taken away by my country's dumb censors, this is still perfect every way I see it.\n\nAuteur Park Chan-Wook's The Handmaiden is a superb exercise in form, structure and tone. With the latter, Park (Oldboy & Joint Security Area) has achieved something extraordinary. If any scene were to linger a few seconds longer or he had decided to focus on a certain issue, the film would have veered off to a different territory. As it is, and with all the major characters' kooky off-kilter portrayals, I can't pinpoint whether I was watching something real or abstract. I was also kept in awe by the intricate and resplendent set- design which suggests something dark and Gothic is working the undercurrents. There are of course some serious girl on girl action but that never encroaches into the spine of the story.\n\nAdapting Sarah Waters' Fingersmith, a Victorian tale awash with all manner of Dickensian motifs, Park spins an engrossing tale that ebbs and flows with a Hitchcockian suspense; it withholds as much as it discloses; it is an erotic tale that beats with raw fervour. It is at once a love story but also a menagerie showcasing human beings in their vilest forms. Park's finger hovers over all the buttons, teasing us gleefully but it is with the ultimate restraint that he never descends down to the usual tropes. The story is divided into three chapters; each told from a different character's perspective. The structure is Rashomon-esque but Park puts his own stamp on it. The film may be nearly 2.5 hours but I hardly moved in my seat; my senses kept spellbound as each twist hits me hard. When it ended I couldn't believe 2.5 hours have whizzed by. The plot is pulsating and it never lets up. There is even an octopus in it! This is definitely the most perfect film I have seen this year. You may not agree with me but for me this is cinema of the masterclass level.\n\nIt's sexy time!"

It is specially visible during the sex scenes, even though the 2 actors had a lot of chemistry and their emotions were mostly shown without them having to say a word those scenes made no sense at all and it was painfully obvious that they were directed by a straight man who has no idea about a relationship like this (have in mind that I'm NOT talking about the writers but the director). I did not feel the femininity I should have which I don't think is an acting or writing problem but a directing one. Overall the camera work and the story line were amazing, the movie is long but you don't feel bored at all and the acting was spot on but in my personal opinion this movie was not able to deliver the message it wanted to."

Overall a really average movie that looked good and had kind of an interesting plot that led to nothing and was really flat in some parts."

The director is in full control, only showing the audience exactly what he intends to show.\n\nFilms, and all media by extension are an endless conversation between the medium and the audience. The role of the one presenting said medium is to manipulate the fourth wall so that the messages become muddled. The audience is left questioning the director's intentions, the things unsaid, the missing information. This precisely describes the experience of watching The Handmaiden, a film that carefully weaves together its various plot threads to one of the most satisfying sequences in recent cinema.\n\nThe only major issue with the film - and none due to any fault in the film's part - is its use of language as an integral plot device. Audiences who are not fluent in Korean will not be able to have quite the same experience with the film.\n\nThough unfortunate circumstances around the film has prevented it from reaching similar acclaim to Parasite, this is another masterpiece of Korean cinema that should not be overlooked."

The plot is full of twists and turns, showing that every event has more going on than what we really knew.

It centres around the charming, butter-wouldn't-melt \"Sook-Hee\" (Tae Ri Kim) who takes a job attending the wealthy \"Lady Hideko\" (Kim Min-hee). She lives on a grand estate with her cantankerous uncle \"Kouzuki\" (Cho Jin-woong) and is frankly rather low maintenance for her new maid. Pretty quickly, though, we begin to smell a rat! Is she what she seems, and what has the obviously duplicitous \"Count\" (Ha Jung-woo) got to do with things? Well gradually, we find out that there are schemes afoot to rob the lady of her fortune, her liberty - even her mind. What the plotting didn't take account for, though, was human nature. A bond gradually starts to build between the two women, a bond of friendship, of trust - of love! What happens next...? This benefits hugely from having a tightly-knit cast who work well together; a solid and intriguing story that marries the Machiavelian with the mischievous, the sexy with the sordid - and, it looks great too. The characters vacillate from being likeable, kinky, and often pretty loathsome in equal measure, but somehow there is always a sense that right will be done! I loved the ending, and the performances from the two women are engaging and captivating. Some of it isn't for the squeamish, but it flew by, is expertly crafted, and I thoroughly enjoyed it."

        "review_title": "Smart, enthralling and theatre-like; but a bit too dense",
        "review_detailed_main": "I watched this a few days ago at the Ljubljana film festival. I wasn't sure whether I wanted to watch it or not, but a string of events led me to a spontaneous viewing. Why wasn't I sure? Because I expected some similarities with Oldboy, the only Chan-Wook Park film I've seen, and even though I loved Oldboy, I knew it's a specific type of cinema that gets you in a certain mood and reverberates days after.\n\nMore than the dark tone of Oldboy, I remembered the overall density of it. I felt like it didn't give me any time to breath. Despite the unquestionable quality of the film, I felt like the scenes in it were competing against one another in three main categories: wit, shock value and contrast in comparison to the previous scene. It seemed a bit technical, a bit too thought-out.\n\nIn Ah-ga-ssi I definitely spotted some similarities with Oldboy - again, not so much in the tone of the film than in the shooting techniques, editing style, theater-like squarry perspective of the shots and the incredible density and intensity of events, shown through wide angles as well as details, that pull you into a world of incredibly well painted subconscious human tendencies, into a nightmarish world where events follow a certain twisted logic and where humour appears in its most darkly form.\n\nIn another review I read that one has to understand korean history in order to better comprehend the film. I definitely agree, but I felt like Ah-ga-ssi is clear enough to let even the most unknowing spectator know what's going on. It is #intuitive enough to be able to translate the micro-meaning (site-specific, historical) onto a universal human level: even though it depicts a certain era of Korean history, it also depicts very basic human tendencies, which one can apply to several historical, as well as personal events. I feel like this is one of the most important quality of good cinema, and one of Ah-ga-ssi's main strengths.\n\nWhat I also loved was the twists - varying from micro ones to big ones. All of the twists are so well drawn-out and built-up earlier in the film that the suspense is crazy. The twists are well presented and very coherent with the story. I felt a bit of Kurosawa's Rashomon in here - the three part structure, the objective/subjective truth theme and even a few visual references to Rashomon. Ah-ga-ssi is immersive and rich with flavour, but is it a bit too rich? Can a movie be too rich?\n\nI felt like everything in this film reflected the theme of illusion - the camera movements, the tricks, the costumes, the characters and the actors. I felt like the team wanted to slightly expose the illusory nature of film as a medium - we know that we're watching something fictional but we still tend to emotionally involve in it. Why is that so? Anyway, I felt like the theater \"set-up\" component could be a bit more visible, it would definitely add a nice self- irony layer upon the smartly built, but a tad stiff cinema puzzle that is Ah-ga-ssi. I love the korean name of this film by the way, much more than Handmaiden. Also, a few moments of rest would be nice for the brain, especially because the tone is so dark. If the film would've been a bit more genre-versatile, I'd love the density, but since the genre definition is pretty clean-cut, because the overall tone of the film is rather dark, and because the story demands a lot of processing, I feel like this film could use a few moments of silence or completely unimportant subplots, just so that the spectator has more time to fill in the gaps with his own ideas.\n\nThe positive definitely outweighs the negative. From the first moment on, I was hooked. I sat there, looking at the actors, thinking about how incredibly good they were. I loved the nakedness & I loved the poetic intertangling of the bodies. I loved the photography in general. I remember very well how the first few minutes produced a tiny drop of uneasiness in me - a tiny drop that grew bigger and bigger as my understanding of the story was becoming better and better. And when I finally grasped all the crazy twists, the meaning behind the unusual behaviour of the characters - pop. It was like fiction immediately turning into dust, the facades shattered, the film-time becoming what it is in the first place - a remnant that can be revisited in order to be viewed again, from a different point of view.\n\nThis was definitely a crazy and cathartic experience. Maybe it would never be as cathartic if it wouldn't be so dense with information on so many different levels. Maybe it was the movie's goal - to pile up as many pieces of information one upon the other, stack the spectators mind with various opposing narratives only to be able to prove the spectator that nowadays, no narrative is the right one - we live in a make-believe world, in a constant state of cold war. We can trust nobody, we have no truth, just multidunous realities that we have to constantly update and make sense of... if we don't want to be fooled."

        "review_detailed_main": "South Korean films are not exactly flavour of the month in Britain, even among \"world cinema\" buffs; the most one can say is that they are at least more popular than North Korean films. \"The Handmaiden\", however, has recently had a long run in central London. Perhaps its popularity can be put down to the fact that it is based upon a novel by a Welsh author, \"Fingersmith\" by Sarah Waters, albeit with the setting changed to Korea under the Japanese occupation. Or perhaps to the fact that it features two beautiful young actresses in bed together.\n\nThe plot is a complex one, too complex to set out here. It revolves around the plans of a conman posing as a Count to marry and elope with Lady Hideko, a Japanese heiress living in Korea with her authoritarian uncle. To further his scheme he hires a Korean girl named Sook-hee to obtain a position as a maid in the uncle's household. The film is divided into three parts, and Parts 1 and 2 essentially tell the story from two different viewpoints, giving us different perspectives on these events. At the end of Part 1, which is largely told from Sook-hee's viewpoint, it appears that Hideko and the supposed \"Count Fujiwara\" have conspired together and played a cruel trick on Sook-hee to enable them to elope together. In Part 2, which is largely told from Hideko's point of view, we realise that appearances can be deceptive and that it may in fact be Sook-hee and Hideko (who have become lesbian lovers) who are in league together.\n\nThe film is not only based upon a British novel; director Park Chan-wook may also have been influenced by the visual style of the British \"heritage cinema\". It is notable that Hideko's uncle lives in an Edwardian-looking European-style mansion built for him by an English architect. The photography certainly has that rich, sumptuous look we have come to associate with British historical dramas, and, like some Western directors such as James Ivory and Martin Scorsese, Park is able to use this style of film-making to shed light on some weighty themes.\n\nThe most important theme explored in this film is that of the mistreatment of women by men. (There is an implication, although perhaps no more than that, that Hodeko and Sook-hee have become lesbians because of the way men have treated them and that under other circumstances they might have been heterosexual). Hideko's uncle Kouzuki is a sex-obsessed bully, whose greatest passion is for his collection of antique erotica. Kouzuki is a widower, his wife having died in what was supposedly a suicide, and it is strongly implied either that she was driven to kill herself by her husband's mistreatment of her or that he in fact murdered her when she tried to leave him. During her lifetime Kouzuki distressed her by forcing her to read from his pornographic books to his guests, and after her death he subjected Hideko to the same treatment. Fujiwara may claim to love Hideko and poses as her liberator from her uncle's tyranny, but in fact he is just interested in her money. As for the working-class Korean Sook-hee, Fujiwara regards her as being both socially and racially inferior so has no compunction about the way he treats her.\n\nThe film occasionally slips into Grand Guignol; the final scene involving Kouzuki and Fujiwara is particularly lurid and does not make a great deal of sense. Overall, however, this is an intriguing, visually and intellectually literate, film from a culture that does not feature very highly on the average British film buff's radar. 8/10"

I honestly did not expect the full-on, pretty much nothing left to the imagination rendition of a rather graphic novel. Bravo!\n\nMy worries were unfounded: not only was Park Chan-wook able to convey the imagery convincingly, the rather complex story-in-two-parts translated wonderfully. The timeline (30's occupied Korea) the utterly sumptuous settings of the Japanese/European style mansion amidst the almost desolate beauty of the countryside and finally, The strong, character driven story lines acted out by a first rate, suitably gorgeous cast.\n\nAs a Japanese speaker, I found the Japanese half of the movie to be blissfully well acted and the Japanese convincing enough, considering the Korean cast... However I was forced to rely on some sub-par subtitling for the Korean half having only sparing knowledge.\n\nFinally, having the original novel and the UK screen version to compare against, If found that the story told here was as triumphant and thoroughly heart-warming ode to trust as was the original and so well adapted to the Korean 30's that it felt truly in place in the sumptuous sets and in the hands of the gorgeous cast."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Handmaiden\" is visually stunning, sensual, and full of twists that will keep you guessing until the very end. Director Park Chan-wook does an incredible job of creating a world that is both beautiful and sinister at the same time. The story is divided into three parts, and each part reveals more layers to the characters and their motives, completely changing how you perceive them. What starts as a con turns into a deeply emotional tale of love, betrayal, and revenge.\n\nOne of the film's strongest points is the relationship between Sook-hee and Lady Hideko. Their chemistry is palpable, and watching their bond grow deeper adds so much emotional depth to the plot. This is more than just a thriller; it's also a commentary on power, manipulation, and the roles of women in a society that seeks to control them. And let's not forget the twisty plot that keeps you on your toes! By the time the film reaches its climax, you realize nothing is as it seemed at first. Definitely a rollercoaster of emotions and a feast for the eyes."

It's undermining, patronising and it comes from an exhausted, and what feels like at this point, an artificial formula.\n\nNote: All I could think of during the scissoring scene, when they clasped hands, was the scene in Predator \"You son of a b*tch\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's the 1930s. Korea is occupied by Japan. A clever rascal named Fujiwara plans a conspiracy to con the Japanese Lady Hideko out of all her money. His idea: The lady shall fall in love with him, and after the marriage he will put her in an asylum. The pickpocket Sook-hee, disguised as a handmaiden, is meant to influence Hideko. Fujiwara, Hideko and Sook-hee entangle themselves in a web of liaisons and intrigues ...\n\n\"The Handmaiden\" by Park Chan-wook is the riveting tale of a love triangle, where nothing is as it seems. It's disturbing, humorous, erotic, suspenseful and cryptic - a treat for everyone enjoying weird and original cinema. Park Chan-wook is well known for his movies dealing with themes such as violence, perversion and insanity. \"The Handmaiden\" might be his most excellent effort to date, even surpassing the powerful revenge thriller \"Oldboy\" (2003), which is a bit too erratic and over the top. This movie however has a clear vision and a much more subtle approach, masterfully playing with the expectations of its audience and twisting the story several times.\n\nThis movie is about men forcing their sexual fantasies on women: Hideko is forced to read grubby texts to a male audience and to perform strange BDSM aerobatics. The only way she can escape this perverted world is through lesbian love, which culminates in one of the most awe-inspiring sex scenes I've ever seen. Park's depiction of sexuality is subversive, as there seems to be no escape from male fantasies no matter what. (And not just because Park is a male director.) There's some really interesting subtext going on here, but that doesn't mean that \"The Handmaiden\" is just pretentious gibberish. No, it tells an entertaining and engaging story as well, all while looking gorgeous. The humour is pretty great, too: There are many laugh out loud scenes. (Yeah, there might be some penis jokes in this.)\n\nWith \"The Handmaiden\", Park Chan-wook proves that he's still one of the most exciting directors in contemporary cinema. His vision is artistic and daring, light-footed and sexy, captivating and beautiful. It's a brutal thriller, a sentimental drama and an erotic romance all at once. A truly original movie. Don't miss it."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have only seen one previous Chan-wook Park film ('Oldboy') and it just so happened it was one of the finest films I have ever seen. I've always planned to see more of his work, but sometimes find it hard to get motivated to watch foreign language films. However, when I saw he had released a film in 2016 which was getting a positive response I decided I had to check it out. 'The Handmaiden' is quite a different tale to 'Oldboy', yet it's told with equal measures of class. Park makes terrific looking films with amazing attention to detail and has an incredible ability to intrigue and fascinate an audience with the complex and intricate stories he tells.\n\n'The Handmaiden' is mostly a love story, partly a mystery and partly a violent thriller. The story is told in three parts. We are told a story, then asked to question everything we have seen, and then given an explanation of sorts. Throughout all of this we are being treated to some wonderful acting, direction and writing. It truly is a wonderfully put together film.\n\nIn some ways this film may alienate a portion of its audience. People who like romances and love stories don't often tend to enjoy high levels of violence. Conversely, those who do enjoy high levels of violence and a mystery/thriller element to their films, don't often have the patience or desire to sit through what is at its heart a love story. This is the only problem I can see this film having. As long as you're able to get past that side of things, you're going to have a good time with this one."

When the old housemaid is dismissed, it is for the innocent Sook-Hee to venture out of the apparent hard work before her. We also have the presence of the charming Count Fujiwara who appears as a pretender to the love of the young Lady. The aura emanating from the house is somber, it is not known exactly what happens inside. And it is inserted in this environment that we will have the outbreak of a true game of cat and mouse, where the masks are slowly undoing, revealing the perverse people who belong in the environment."

Beautiful costumes, the script is the great wonder of the film, an erotic suspense with great surprises even for those Holmes who usually see a good policeman. Impeccable performances as usually oriental films are, but without excesses as it is also customary to see in their films. Unfortunately it did not make a commercial profit, perhaps because it was made for such a high age rating that it cannot be shown in so many theaters, or because it was made for more festivals."

Amidst everything that carefully decorated this delicate artistic expression, the rapport between the lead pair shone the brightest.

        "review_detailed_main": "Man, Korean films are just exceptional in their writing, and The Handmaiden (2016) is an excellent example of that. I never would've imagined for the plot to be executed in that way at all. Splitting this movie into three parts from three different perspectives was an unbelievably stellar decision, I cannot stress it enough. I bet even Hollywood writers can admit that the storytelling of this feature exceeds that of many many Hollywood films. You see, if you were to just retell the story but in simple chronological order (and not from different perspectives), it's actually a relatively simple one (subplot aside), yet somehow the writers, along with Chan-wook's directing, manage to make it seem so complex. It truly deserves many plaudits for this alone.\n\nAs for the cast, every member put in phenomenal performances. The protagonists in particular - Sook-Hee (Kim Tae-ri), Lady Hideko (Kim Min-hee), & Count Fujiwara (Ha Jung-woo) - were remarkable. It's impossible to go more in-depth on their acting without spoiling the film, so all I'll say is, they were faultless.\n\nCinematography was pretty damn good as well, worth the mention. I was surprised to see the use of a sudden zoom-in at one point to channel all our focus onto the speaker, since that's typically a camera technique used in much older movies (Judgment at Nuremberg is a brilliant example), but I'm a massive fan of it, so I'm always happy to see it being utilised. And here it served a strong purpose, as did the cinematography in general.\n\nDespite all the positives, I had just one issue with the movie, which is simply that it was very confusing during key scenes. For example, when Count Fujiwara is explaining his scheme to the handmaidens through the use of props, I was so lost that I had to rewind back to finally get a grasp on things, which I really shouldn't have to do as a viewer. Maybe it's more of a me problem though, I'm not sure.\n\nOverall, I urge you to check this out if you haven't already. There's a reason why this is in both the IMDb *and* Letterboxd top 250s. It is so close to a masterpiece for me, and I can totally see why people consider it to be one."

The Handmaiden certainly has one of the best Twist for any thriller in the last decade but the film is hurt because the climax is revealed much before it opens the 2nd and 3rd subplots of the narrative. The primary plot is, A woman is hired as a handmaiden to a Japanese heiress, but secretly she is involved in a plot to defraud her. When the 2nd plot running along with it is opened we audience are totally shocked but then there is third plot which is even weaker than any ordinary single plot thriller to spoil the momentum. There are plenty of small small loopholes in the Twists but formally endurable because you are going to witness something amazing after that but then you meet one weak side of this narrative which doesn't do anything thrilling but just eat time and make it Overlong. Just imagine, if the third story in the film had pre-planned twist, The Handmaiden would have probably ended as the 'Best Erotic Thriller Ever made'. For now the opportunity is lost but anyways it still has 2 Great Twisty tales corners and 1 weak side in this triangular Thriller. People might not like the sexual explicit scenario but somehow it was used correctly according to the need of the script and thankfully it wasn't added deliberately just to please perverts. The Handmaiden is technically very powerful because the use of camera and background score makes this one look quite furtive. All the actors have done no compromises while being wild physically and verbally which is impressive. Director Chan-wook Park did a great job while crafting it but only if could have made it more pacy as pace is one of the most needed element in thriller genre. Overall it's a Great Erotic triangle of thrill in which two sides are strong and one is weak. Surely Watchable but not a Must see material.\n\nRATING - 7/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest"

Now Chan-Wook slightly changed his style and made a more accessible movie for the general audience, but at the same time a great movie.\n\n'The Handmaiden' is clever, well constructed, full of great characters and in a strange but understandable way erotic. Especially, the two female characters showed a great range of emotions and acting skill in this movie. I most admit after the first big turn in the story of the movie, i expected the way the story would play out in the end.

        "review_detailed_main": "Park Chan-wook is one of the most versatile directors around. Sure, Park seems fixated on tales of vengeance but never does the worn theme feel like a detractor in his films. Oldboy and Snowpiercer add intricate layers which transform the initial quest for revenge into other issues entirely. The Handmaiden is a movie that keeps the best traits of the South Korean director. Sure revenge underlines the narrative and yet the film is not entirely about revenge. Likewise, the Handmaiden is an erotic thriller and isn't an erotic thriller. A lesser director would hone in on the pornographic but the film never undercuts one of the meta-messages found within the film. Without spoiling Handmaiden, a Clockwork Orange is a film with a similar meta-commentary directed at the audience. Instead, the erotic scenes give the intended effect without going full throttle. The result is a lesbian love story which accentuates emotion over physicality. Male directors have a tendency to get a little excited with lesbian love stories and turn an otherwise amazing movie into pornography. Blue is the Warmest Color is a recent example of a film which could have utilized a little restraint required of its subject matter. The central \"love triangle\" in the Handmaiden is given an air of realism due to the level of restraint. Most characters are never who they appear to be throughout the film. In fact, the three chapter structure of the film allows for the rare successful attempt at having more than one plot twist. Film veterans are likely the only group of people who can put the puzzle pieces together early on. The twists never come across as cheap gimmicks thanks to the cinematography. The gorgeous mise en scene is spellbinding with the amount of variation found in limited locations. In spite of the lavish designs, the camera never hides character ticks one can begin to hone in on. The Handmaiden contains a lot of the admirable traits one might in a Stanley Kubrick film (the Clockwork Orange reference is not entirely pulled out of a hat). However, the middle-aged Korean director is able to separate and maybe transcend Kubrick in his use of overt dark humor. Manchester by the Sea is another serious film which also successfully utilizes humor to create a humanistic story. Kubrick usually utilizes dark comedy for an entirely different effect. The Handmaiden is an absolutely must-see for those who appreciate cinematic greatness."

        "review_detailed_main": "When considering the pantheon of greatest living directors, few names spring to mind more readily than Park Chan-wook. He makes films that are staggeringly operatic, meticulously crafted, and always stylishly visceral, specializing in films which showcase several perspectives of Korean class and social strata, usually with a degree of bone-crunching violence thrown in for good measure.\n\nThe Handmaiden, an unequivocal masterpiece, is set during the Japanese occupation of 1930s Korea, taking place primarily in the opulent residence of a Japanese heiress. Park has made his bones by shooting gritty, intense action films, but his handling of the subtle textures, unspoken relationships, and tranquil landscapes of the rich is equally as breathtaking. In addition to the tense, languid drama, there still exists the seedy underbelly of the story, which is just as taboo, intense, and primal as any previous Park film.\n\nThe film follows Sook-Hee, who becomes a handmaiden for Japanese heiress Lady Hideko under false pretenses. Influencing events from their own perches are Count Fujiwara and Uncle Kouzuki, who wish to control both women for their clandestine purposes.\n\nThe Handmaiden is easily the best film of 2016 and one of the best movies I've ever watched. Every single element is perfectly absorbing, wonderfully engaging, and hold-your-breath-throughout tense. It is satisfying visually, emotionally, and psychologically, balancing the turmoil of its characters' political and emotional dynamics with the jaw-dropping beauty of the central estate. Every pan, tilt, and dolly generate greater engagement of the story, every actorly choice and motion provides new information about their interior states, and every structural development gives the film greater and deeper intrigue. This is a nearly flawless film.\n\nThis will be a deliberately vague review (just go see it, get up right now and go watch The Handmaiden) but I would like to praise each and every central performance. Kim Min-hee, Kim Tae-ri, Ha Jung-woo, and Cho Jin-woong are all absolutely captivating. Kim Min-hee plays Lady Hideko with a deeply felt vulnerability and uncertainty for the world ahead of her. Kim Tae-ri effectively captures the emotional volatility and shaky arrogance of Sook-Hee's youth. Ha Jung-woo's Count Fujiwara is brash and suave, and Jung-woo possesses an incredibly assured charisma. Cho Jin-woong is a menacing, rigid force as Uncle Kouzuki. In tandem, the four work off each other beautifully.\n\nI don't want to give too much more detail about The Handmaiden. It's a difficult film to critique because there are simply no negative elements, dull moments, or curiously distracting creative decisions. There's no path to free associate on how the film could be improved or approached from a different perspective, even in minor ways.\n\nConstructing reviews is so much fun because the mind tinkers with the film, repositioning pieces and rethinking decisions to create a new mental product. This proves difficult because the film is free of fat, frequently organic, and fully realized, with a superbly tight internal logic and masterful pacing. In the case of The Handmaiden, watching the film is proving far more fun than reviewing it; I can scarcely give higher praise.\n\nI've exhausted every filmic superlative, and would like to refrain from wading through the weeds of the plot. This film should be seen with absolute minimalknowledge going in because each scene is informative and surprising. It plays like a patiently delivered oral tradition, and I'd rather not ruin Park's careful method by giving away any details. I'll just say that the man knows how to weave a great yarn, and you won't be disappointed.\n\nDon't let the length of this review misguide you. The Handmaiden is a masterful film which doesn't need paragraphs of detail about how great it is; it only needs to be seen, and it's best if you go in blind. Check out the logline on IMDB and let it be your only primer. The only piece of relevant information you should know is that the film earns its rating, a very hard R. Those uncomfortable with sexual depictions...may not like the film. Those who have no qualms with graphic imagery will love it, so go dim the lights, grab some popcorn, get comfortable, and enjoy."

        "review_title": "The Handmaiden is unexpectedly one of the best thrillers I've seen, beautifully shot and directed with some spectacular acting",
        "review_detailed_main": "In the 1930s Korea, in the period of Japanese occupation, a new girl (Sookee) is hired as a handmaiden to a Japanese heiress (Hideko) who lives a secluded life on a large countryside estate with her domineering Uncle (Kouzuki). But the maid has a secret. She is a pickpocket recruited by a swindler posing as a Japanese Count to help him seduce the Lady to elope with him, rob her of her fortune, and lock her up in a madhouse. The plan seems to proceed according to plan until Sookee and Hideko discover some unexpected emotions.\n\nThat's the story for The Handmaiden, a South Korean production. It is inspired by the 2002 novel Fingersmith by Welsh writer Sarah Waters, with the setting changed from Victorian era Britain to Korea under Japanese colonial rule. Park Chan-wook (the director) co-wrote the film with Chung Seo-kyung. This is the first film of Chan-wook which I'm watching and certainly not the last, I think the direction and writing are two of the strong points in the movie, the cinematography and acting too. It stars Kim Min-hee as Lady / Izumi Hideko, Kim Tae-ri as Maid / Nam Sook-hee, Ha Jung-woo as Count Fujiwara, Cho Jin-woong as Uncle Kouzuki and Kim Hae-sook as Madame Sasaki. The former two, Kim Min-hee and Kim Tae-ri are excellent in their roles, Min-hee's performance are award worthy! There's so much emotion, power and range in her performance, nailing every mannerism and acting. In 2020, The New York Times ranked Kim sixteenth on its list of \"The 25 Greatest Actors of the 21st Century\". I have only seen her in this and honestly, it's a superb performance, I can thus not talk about the placing but I found it worth noting to describe her strong acting in the film. The cinematography and imagery is brilliant and will probably appeal anyone who loves photography or cinematography.\n\nThe Handmaiden is told through three parts, the first one has me sitting invested throughout the whole hour with some great direction and writing, three dimensional characters and an excellent story, the film has some of the best storytelling I've seen for a while, it's perfection. The second part goes deep into the psychological thriller genre and less drama-thriller which the first part had, the thing is how different it is and how difficult it can be to watch but the writing and direction along with acting and cinematography is there from start to finish, same with the third part, giving the film a spectacular conclusion. I've read so much about this film, critics who love it and the same for the audience, it won the category of Best Film Not in the English Language at the BAFTAs after all. The Guardian ranked it 41st in its 100 best films of the 21st century list, also ranking it number 1 among the classics of modern South Korean Cinema. Overall, The Handmaiden was listed on numerous critics' top ten lists. I agree, this must be one of the best thrillers I've seen, which I didn't expect."

        "review_detailed_main": "The sttings are splendid, set in a Korea being occupied by Japan, and mostly in a mansion that is half-english and half-japanese. There is much going on about social status and nationality and the productionis careful about what languages the character is using even though it is all subtitled.\n\nA rich book-loving older man has arranged to raise and marry a niece with a fortune. The other main male is pure con-man who has contrived a way to get the same fortune. The niece's handmaiden was brought aboard to help steer the target. This is all set up early; a spoiler would be still a long time away, as who is conspiring against who changes. The word \"underestimated\" is used a lot, meaning advantage to whoever is the most deceiving, strategic, and cold. A love is found---unless it's a trap. The deceptions are not so horrible since there is a clash of cultures anyway.\n\nThere is sex and guessing is encouraged, but no comedy or horror. It is long, divided into three parts with a different perspective... The first protagonist is the handmaiden Soon with aliases (Kim Tae-ri), but others get their reveals. It just feels wrong to call this movie asian, when it is deeply Oriental and set a hundred or so years ago. Deeply asian is less of a thing.\n\nI thought movie a bit overconcerned with greatness, but at least it does aim high, and does give multiple perspectives. To me it did not have distracting holes."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Handmaiden was born as an adaptation of Sarah Water's 2002 novel Fingersmith, a Victorian crime novel Park Chang-wook took the inspiration from, taking as a reference its investigation in repression and the limits of female empowerment. Despite of this, he was able to convert the story, the characters and the costumes and scenarios into the dynamics of the Japanese occupation of South Korea during the war. Thus, the film tackles themes as love, betrayal, conflicts on personal interests and liberation. With only four characters, the movie offers a magnificent story with several plots and twists, thanks to a successful choice of narrative style and form. The Handmaiden is an amazing movie that evidences the perfected style of a recognized director who surpasses himself with every movie he releases, that shows majestic combinations of quality cinematography, editing, sound and the perfect use of scenarios, a very well written and complex characters, along with an even more well developed story throughout the plot, thanks to the correct decisions made on form and style of the film. All of this brings together an amazing experience that makes this movie an outstanding work in the 7th art history."

Director/ Writer Chan-wook Park \"Mr. Vengeance\" (known for his \"Vengeance Trilogy\"), along with writer Seo-Kyung Chung provide a sexy, seductive, cat and mouse drama that peeks into the Japanese culture where shy pickpocketer turned Handmaiden Sook-Hee (Kim Tae-ri) is placed with the strictly watched Lady Hideki (Min-hee Kim), at the request of swindler Count Fujiwara (Jung-woo Ha), one of many men who participate in her Uncle Kouzuk (Jin-woong Jo) \"readings. Under Chan-wook Park's captivating direction, and very crazy imagination, the acting is outstanding and what you see may not necessarily be what you think. While the film clocks in at just under 2 1/2 hours, requiring the viewer to almost watch the film twice (you'll understand when you see the film), and more than a handful of audience members walked out, those who stick with the presentation will surly be glad they did. Japanese films are almost always a \"hit or miss\" experience. With \"The Handmaiden,\" the cultural adventure is a hit."

        "review_detailed_main": "Those who are into the world cinema, particularly the Korean, knows Park Chan-wook very well. But if you don't, then you must. His films are definitely for the grown ups. Like everybody else, my admiration for his work has started a decade ago with the film 'Oldboy'. He had tried his luck in Hollywood with 'Stoker'. Despite a good entertainer, it was criticised. I love Park Chan-wook doing hundred masterpieces like this in Korea than trying to do one in Hollywood. His ability to turn the good book into a great flick was phenomenal. Here it goes another one. This was based on the British novel 'Fingersmith' by Sarah Waters. The story of an orphan woman who assigned to be a maid for a young rich woman who is living under the shadow of her uncle since she has no parents.\n\nYeah, I was expecting it, but I did not think it would be another masterpiece from the director. I even thought the ratings could be exaggerated, and the reviews from his die hard fans like Nolan's or QT's fans does. The timeline of the story was prior to Second World War Korea under the Japan rule. A perfect setting for such theme. The film opened like it is an average film. That's where all I got wrong. Or probably I judged it too soon. The storytelling was split into three parts and the first part was a bit mix of fun and like any film, introduction, the platform for the rest of the narration filled with surprises.\n\nThe young orphan Sook-hee was recruited by a thief who is planning to trick a young woman named Lady Hideko with all the wealth left behind by her parents. The only obstacle for him is her uncle, a guardian. So Sook-hee becomes close to her. More than she had expected, but their plan is working. Now they have to wait for the perfect moment for a perfect strike. When it arrives, an unexpected twist takes the tale to go back to where the film originally had started. But even further earlier and this time, the perspective of the story was from the Lady Hdeko.\n\n\u275dSo even if my love for you leads me to ruin, don't pity me.\u275e\n\nSo, with that flashback, the second part begins. But literally it was a series of twist, that keep explaining us in another angle of the whole scenario I had witnessed in the previous part. Believe me, I have never seen such a long twist before. I was like unmoved for that entire segment. One of the best things I have ever in a film. The praise must go to the author, but the director and his actors as well did a fine job. There's a twist in every scene. So, for that one must pay close attention to the first part, despite slow moving story.\n\nBut above all, what I'm surprised was I did not know it was a lesbian film. Moreover, I did not think it could have bold scenes for such theme. Everything seemed perfect. I mean the erotic parts are sensual, but very artistic than unnecessary disturbance. Mainly because of stronger hold of the story narration than anything else. Even the pace picks up, like a crazy speed. Everything about the film you would learn in this section. All the secrets of the past revealed and what might comes are still kept under mysterious for the third and final part.\n\nThe most awaited, the conclusion part begins forth. For everything we saw so far, what might come after makes this film at its best. Just like the mid part, this is also full of twists. Because it will going to tell who ends where and what they get. Over two hours long film, and every frame are worth. The casting was best and so the setting of the 1930s Korea. Especially I must applaud the filmmaker's effort to turn the original setting from Europe to East Asia. It was great, but still now and then you can see the influence of the original source. I mean western culture, names, architect references which might have come from the book.\n\nNot just the lesbian or a love triangle story, but something like a circle of love with deceive and defraud. You can notice that in the film poster with four main characters. So when it has a multiple strings attached, you could expect surprises/twists from each angle and it gives that more the convincingly. Put this into your must see list. This is not the first screen adaptation, but surely the best so far. Now we can expect a European or a Hollywood project in a big scale soon. Believe me the Oscars would pour in, because it's that kind of story. Highly recommended!\n\n8/10"

Park's screenwriting is as well impressive, as he is able to weave together facets of cinema, from passionate romance, heavy drama, to dark humor & contained horror, rendering the 145 minute runtime as an effortless viewing experience. Myriad of praise to the remarkable cast, who shines in between these transitions through immaculate acting. Visually, The Handmaiden boasts of splendid cinematography as well, that each frame is either a thing of beauty, or meticulously detailed.\n\nOverall, Park Chan Wook delivers another stunning film that screams quality & storytelling genius. The perfectly structured, jaw dropping narrative that is further complemented by Park's rich in detail, filmmaking prowess, sets The Handmaiden apart as one that is exquisite & simply beautiful."

I beg to differ. It's overrated."

The film is not afraid to be ahead of its audience, nor allow it to settle. Nothing here is what it seems. Very, very beautiful, Ah-ga-ssi embrace the audience, and does not let go until he is excited and surprised."

I mean come on this is just nonsense and a total waste of time. Intense, gripping and a masterpiece you claimed what are you watching! What are you sniffing! I know what it is it's Hollywood panicking that they've got to include other cultures in how things go. It's got to stop. I will judge a movie how I see and how it exactly is. Let's socially and professionally and poking fun at you now politically involve these other nations work and admire what they've done well no not if the work isn't up to standard. Wow.

The story is separated into three parts, showing different occurrences through other points of view with different contexts. The director wants the audience to second, even third guess themselves. One part might show a particular scene one way, and the next may show it through a different angle/tone, adding or excluding dialogue. It creates an atmosphere where the characters true intentions are not clear. This contributes to the film's unpredictability. The set for much the movie is an incredible estate, built with an extreme contrast in English and Japan architecture. A maze lending itself to voyeurism and eavesdropping. The sex scene (shown twice with different contexts) is as intense and provoking as it gets for the big screen. Much homage is payed to artistic vision in this movie: The shots of the many scrolls and paintings/drawings themselves, the closeups of spying eyes, the visual reenactment of the erotic novels, and scenes with the estates Japanese gardens as the backdrop. Pickpocket or handmaiden? Count or con? Pampered Countess or prisoner?"

The director takes his time to unfold the story; making it appealing and bloody interesting. The twists are all so cleverly written; it's witty, funny and romantically naive at times. This movie is a present; a gift; and needs time to be appreciated. The music throughout the film is on point.\n\nKim Min-Hee (as Lady Hideko), Kim Tae-Ri (as Sookee) and Ha Jung-Woo (as The Count) are exceptionally good - their performances are remarkable. _____________________________ Rating: 5 STARS / 5 Story: 5 STARS / 5 Direction: 5 STARS / 5 Performance(s): 5 STARS / 5 for the Entire Cast _____________________________ JUST Consider watching -The HANDMAIDEN-"

The crusher plot line was \"inspired by 'Fingersmith,'\" one of Sarah Waters's tales of the lesbian demimonde, and the film kicks off with some vintage romance-novel shtick \u2014a scoundrel's plotting to elope with an heiress, Lady Hideko, and relieve her of her fortune.\n\nHe installs an accomplice, a skilled female pickpocket (that's what a \"fingersmith\" is, apparently), as Hideko's lady's maid to help him win her over, and the intense relationship that develops between the lady and the lady's maid is what saves \"The Handmaiden\" from being just another forgettable genre film like \"Stoker.\" There's some pervy Sadean stuff involving a hanging tree and forged pornographic MSS and such, but the two heroines' tale is so compelling and the plot ticks over so smoothly\u2014despite an amazing WTF?! moment at the end of part one\u2014that you'll barely notice. Great performances, fascinating background (esp. the Koreans' cultural cringe toward their depraved Japanese rulers); those who have problems with what a know-it-all Netflix reviewer called \"tribadic\" sex scenes\u2014not even sure that's the right word\u2014should probably look elsewhere, however"

Nor who was really who, nor if it changed to alternate possible points of view, or what was real & what was not. Should I be embarrassed that I somehow, have lost my cognitive abilities? NO, I think this film which amazingly has (at this moment) an 8+ rating is just too into it's own self reference that it doesn't even realize how meandering & confusing is apparently likes to be !"

He then suffered a huge period of \"meh\" movies...\n\n... and is back in form with what may very well be his best movie.\n\nThe Handmaiden is a display of a director who now controls all the codes of movie making. The photography is beautiful and carries you to the Japanese controlled Korea of the 30s. The sets are gorgeous and the shots even more.\n\nThe editing also makes the movie. Park plays with his viewers with smart editing, going through the same story in three passes. And it just works, builds empathy and hate for the same three characters across the movie. It's smart and the strength of the movie.\n\nThe topic is what might disturb some and, without spoiling, it is a little R Rated and saphic.\n\nIf that doesn't disturb you - go for it, it's such a great movie!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Chan Woo Park's \"The Handmaiden\" is a fantastic film that borders on being a masterpiece. From a film making perspective alone, both its cinematography and editing are incredible (and I don't use that word lightly). As of this moment this is the best shot film of the year. The shots are gorgeous and the camera work is fantastic; the camera always seems to move to the perfect angle at the perfect time to maximize the quality of each and every scene. Lots of times the movie jumps out of chronological order rapidly between scenes. These scenes never feel hard to follow and they always transition into each other beautifully. By showing moments of the film out of order (as well as some scenes multiple times from different viewpoints), the movie allows the viewer to glean new information about the characters and the story. And yes, the story is also very good and filled with deep characters and twists at every turn. \"The Handmaiden\" is definitely not a good first rated-R movie to show your kids, however. In fact, maybe only \"The Wolf of Wallstreet\" rivals this movie when it comes to the sheer graphicness of nudity and sex scenes (besides NC-17 films of course and much of Lars Von Triers work). What I love about the sex scenes besides the fact that they're, you know, hot sex scenes, is that they aren't there just help somebody feel the blood flow down low. They actually serve a purpose; both to the story and to the development of the film's major characters (They do have some nasty and loud a** licking sounds going on in them that I can't say I'm a fan of however). The other graphic aspect of this movie is its violence. This movie isn't overly violent, and in fact there are only a handful (this is a pretty good pun if you've seen the movie) of scenes with any brutality in them whatsoever, but trust me when I say those scenes aren't for the faint of heart. The movie's blackly comical nature helps negate lots of the more disturbing aspects of these moments as well. Park has made his best movie to date in my opinion, and it goes without saying that I love \"The Handmaiden\"."

And same with the soundtrack!\n\nHowever i do agree with many reviews here on imdb. I think it mostly is a pretty overrated film. A very slow, dull and sometimes boring and confusing movie. Pretty bad storytelling. The story is not very easy to follow, unless your very easily entertained.\n\nActing is very good and feels very authentic.\n\nBut its a really well made film with a interesting story. But still a very weird and confusing one. I dont get it to 100% really. But very well made, but lacking with the storytelling. A weird film, but a smart psychological thriller."
