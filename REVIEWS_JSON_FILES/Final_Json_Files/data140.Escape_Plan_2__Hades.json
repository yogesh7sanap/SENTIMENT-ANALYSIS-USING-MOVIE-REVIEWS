I really liked the first one and thought that the cast in this one was decent. Sadly, almost nothing about it works.\n\nThe script is disastrously bad. The plot and pace are all over the place, making an 85 minute movie feel long. The cinematography is horrendous. The movie is filled with neon lights that are almost headache inducing. The fight scenes are banal and are there just for the sake of it.There are Sci-Fi elements that serve little purpose and don't really fit. Oh, and Stallone and Batista are secondary characters. This would not be a problem if the leads were interesting, charismatic or well written, but they unfortunately are none of those things.\n\nI enjoy B movies. For me, everything can be forgiven if the movie is fun. But this is just boring."

So you would think I went in expecting to see Stallone. I was wrong. A team needs a setup, I do not care about any of the characters. The lead Asian man was a nice surprise since I love martial arts movies but his character is like a walking cliche. He does martial arts, meditates etc. It feels shoehorned in to give him weight. His martial arts seem good but that leads me me to the main problem I have with this movie: they cannot keep the camera still at all. Why, oh why is it so hard to keep the camera still? Put the damn thing on a table, the constant movement(AWAY FROM THE ACTION) does not help, it ruins the coreography which seems good, just that I can't see any of it because the damn camera moves so much all over the place. I apologise for cursing but I honestly was really looking forward to this movie, being a Stallone fan but this movie I cannot recommend in any way shape or form. Stick to the first one."

It blends suspense , thrills, action , twists and turns . it is believed that no one can ever flee from impregnable prison , except for a daring man , Ray Bresl\u00edn : a senile Silvester Stallone . As he manages an elite team of security specialists trained in the art of breaking people out of the most impenetrable prisons . Years after he fought his way out of an inescapable prison , Ray has organized a new awesome security force formed by brave members played by Dave Bautista , Xiamong Huang , Jesse Metcalf . And his usual colleague , the resourceful technology expert Shu Ren : 50 Cent Jackson , as well as his sweet companion Abigail : Jaime King .But one of his team members goes missing , as he is kidnapped and disappears inside the most elaborate jail ever built : \u00a8Hades\u00a8 , entirely computerized by a huge super computer called Galileo and ordinarily changing its shape , then Bresl\u00edn has to return to the hell he once escaped from . As a decrepit Ray must track him down with the help of his former colleagues , infiltrating himself into a futuristic facility with extreme security measures . This is not a prison , it is a Machine . He's back.\n\nThis thrilling flick packs intrigue , nail-biting violence and lots of fights . The movie takes place into four walks of a high technology jail with plenty of computers and glimmer lights . Of course , expired Stallone is also locked and equally determinated to get his freedom, using his special skills to break out , as he goes on to push the boundaries of what is human possible , dealing with his preparatives and fights to escape by confronting nasty enemies . Sylvester Stallone plays in his ordinary , but already out-of-date , style as the obstinate hero to get the wished escape .The final confrontation between Stallone supported by his underlings and the baddies is stimulating and violent , including some surprises . In the film shows up some actors from previous installment as 5o Cent Jackson , and Stallone himself , adding others as Xiamong Huang , Dave Bautista, Wes Chatham , Titus Welliver and Jaime King who replaced Amy Ryan as Abigail .The motion picture was badly directed by Steven C Miller and was filmed in 20 days only , and several countries was exhibited direct to video . Steve C Miller is an expert on action and terror movies , usually played by famous actors , but with no much success , such as : Line of duty , First kill, Arsenal, Marauders , Submerged , Extraction , Under the bed , The agression Scale, Scream of the Banshee , Automaton transfusion , among others. Rating 3.5/10. Only for Sylvester Stallone's hardcore fans .\n\nThis Escape plan trilogy is formed by the first , original and the best : \u00a8Escape plan\u00a8 2013 by Mikael Hafstrom with James Cazievel , Arnold Schwarzenegger, 50 cent Jackson , Amy Ryan , Vinnie Jones ; in which Stallone finds himself set up and incarcerated in the world's most secret and secure prison, \u00a8The Tomb\u00a8 -a highly fortified prison based on his own design- and he must use his skills to escape with help from the inside . Following a third outing titled \u00a8The extractors\u00a8 2019 by John Herzfeld with 50 Cent , Jaime King , Sea Bruckner , Russell Wong , Daniel Bernhardt, this latter concerns a rescue of the abducted daughter of a Hong Kong mogul from a formidable Latvian prison,, then Breslin's girlfriend is also kidnapped."

Stallone and Schwarzenegger headlined 2013's Escape Plan teaming up for the first time since the Expendables but moreover working together for the entire movie. Why Stallone why? Why was this movie made? What is wrong with this movie? Boring as hell, A lot of CGI, shaky cam, horrible dialogue, horrible acting, terrible music sound, Stallone isn't even in this movie.\n\nThe plot makes no sense. This movie is more a sci-fi film, it has no action. The plot is pointless. Horrible shaky cam jumps up and down. When Stallone fights on the end, that is his stunt double. Stallone is far too old to fight with a younger guy. What the hell Stallone? Why did he went to make this movie? Did he do it only for the money? In this movie Stallone isn't much in it! His character Ray Breslin is useless, he does nothing. Sly is old and his character is old fat sack! Sly even him self is disappointed, I am dissappointed Sly. Hades might boast some decent star power, but there isn't a celebrity in the world who could save this bargain bin nonsense from feeling like a bootlegged ripoff of its own franchise. Not even Arnold Schwarzenegger, who faced off against Stallone in the first one, could have rescued this from abject boredom.\n\nThe ending is unexplained this movie is nosence un realistic joke! I will never watch this movie again. I don't need to watch this movie in my life again. I am staying away. I am Stallone fan 4 life but this sequel? Attrocius sucks! It sucks, sucks, sucks and sucks more. Dave Bautista is wasted in this movie. The plot makes no sense, the soundtrack makes no sense. This movie is garbage waste material deserve to be in trash. Who ever is going to buy this movie on Blu-ray disc will have a bad day! Stallone's worst garbage movie he ever did, he only made it for the money.\n\nJaime King as Abigail is in this movie replacing Amy Ryan, but we don't see the actress whole picture only half of it. 50 Cent I don't see him full lengt I only see him half. Horrible cast, horrible acting, horrible writing, horrible direction. Steven C. Miller messy blew it, you blew it Miller! This movie is really bloody messy, stay away. It has so manny CGI colors, no songs, no heart, no souls nothing!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I never saw the first film, \"Escape Plan\", and only saw the sequel because it's apparently awful. How do I know this? It has made its way onto IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List--a list of the lowest rated 100 films with at least 10,000 ratings. It now is number 97...but by the time you read this it might have changed position or might no longer be on the list.\n\nI should point out that I have little interest in most action films...particularly Sylvester Stallone's. He's made a few very good movies, but, for the most part, I just don't enjoy the sorts of pictures he makes. So why did I watch it? Well, the answer is above...it's supposed to be a horrible film and sometimes I enjoy watching one of these to see if it's really as bad as its IMDB score would indicate.\n\nStallone is the head of some private group of 'good' mercenaries. They specialize in extricating prisoners from their evil captors around the world. As for Stallone, he is the boss and doesn't work in the field any more--and considering his age, it makes sense that he sends younger folks to run these missions. However, when one of his best men is kidnapped and sent to a 'super-duper prison', Stallone himself is going back to the field.\n\nI felt mad when the film explained why the team member was kidnapped. Why? Because if the writers had even done some BASIC research, they would have learned that the plot was impossible. Let me explain: to receive a patent for an idea or product, you need to register it. When you do so, you describe the exact formula. The film supposedly has kidnapped the team member and his family member because this family member patented a secret plan which can disable the world's computers....but that plan should all described in the patent! What they really meant is that whatever he'd developed was top secret or the like...not a patented product. My wife have has a few patents and I understand this part of the process...apparently the writers did not!\n\nWhat I also hated about the film is the prison the two are being kept in because it's like something out of a sci-fi movie. The prison supposedly is all automated and can rearrange and change...thus making it hard to plan on how to break into it. The idea is just dumb...let alone impossible with modern technology. It also is dumb that within this silly prison there are no holds barred fights...almost constantly. Just a lot of mindless macho theatrics if you ask me.\n\nSo is the rest of this badly written film any good? Well, for those who want punching, kicking, explosions and killing, the film will fit the goods...though this alone doesn't make a movie...or at least a good one. It's also slickly made...and it's obvious they spent a lot of money on the picture to make it look and sound good. But again, this doesn't mean the story is any good. And that brings me to the final thing I didn't like about the film....if you are going to spend $45,000,000 to make it, why is the weakest thing about the thing the writing/plot??\n\nOverall, a slick but dopey film. I cannot see, however, anyone putting it in the Bottom 100...not because it's good but because there are hundreds of stupider and worse pictures. I assume this one made the list less because it's really among the very worst but was mostly a big disappointment to Stallone's fans."

And it is an error to snowball this film by taking account of the CGI.\n\nLets examine this case in reverse. What if the same film frame by frame had an astonishing expensive super impressive CGI ? You would not be able to see past that. The meaning of this film would be hidden under so many layers of heavy CGI that you would not be able to see the meaning.\n\nThe cheap CGI releases the ability of the viewer to receive the meaning of this film. It makes it easier to see past the effects curtain and see what is on the other side. Stallone knows this. He is an extremely experienced actor and film maker, he might not be a Stanley Kubrick but in this case I think the cheap CGI was meant to be cheap from the start. I think it was a wise choice to do so by Stallone.\n\nAnd that is why we are going to get another escape plan."

Maybe I'll come here to read the Critics reviews but not to read the viewers reviews. Because I could be stop from having some fun watching this movie which has a solid plot (no plot holes), good action and it doesn't pretend to be something which it isn't.

Unfortunately, this did not happen and I was disappointed by it. The plot was simple, boring and in some moment did not make any sense while the direction which was made by Steven C. Miller was below average. The interpretation of Sylvester Stallone who played for one more time as Ray Breslin was good but not good enough to save this movie. Lastly, I have to say that \"Escape Plan 2: Hades\" is not the best movie and if you have watched the first movie then I am sure you will be disappointed so, I do not recommend you to watch it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Escape Plan 2: Hades fails to capture the magic of the original film, leaving much to be desired. While I was excited to see a continuation of the story, the film ultimately falls flat due to its lack of focus on the beloved character of Ray Breslin, played by Sylvester Stallone. With Stallone's role significantly diminished, he feels more like a background character than the formidable lead we came to appreciate in the first installment.\n\nThe film shifts its focus to a new group of characters and their struggles within the titular Hades, a high-tech prison that feels less compelling than the previous setting. While there are moments of action, the narrative lacks the intricate plotting and tension that made the first Escape Plan so engaging. Instead of the clever heists and psychological maneuvers that defined the original, this sequel relies more on generic action tropes that fail to hold the audience's attention.\n\nThe absence of Stallone as a central figure detracts from the overall experience, and the character dynamics feel underdeveloped as a result. The film does not capitalize on the chemistry and camaraderie that made the first film memorable, leading to a disjointed viewing experience.\n\nIn summary, Escape Plan 2: Hades is a disappointing sequel that lacks the heart and intrigue of its predecessor. For fans of the original, it may be hard to overlook these shortcomings, making it a less-than-satisfying addition to the franchise."

        "review_detailed_main": "The original \"Escape Plan\" movie wasn't an action classic, but it was all the same a fun diversion. Although it underperformed at the box office in North America, it was a hit in China, which explains why several years later we have this sequel. Although I had read some brutal reviews of this sequel here and elsewhere, all the same I decided to give it a chance, because I am usually more forgiving of B movies with limited budgets.\n\nThe fact that Sylvester Stallone this time around had been demoted to a supporting role, and that there was more focus on the Chinese character, did not bother me. However, pretty much everything else about the movie did. The budget is a lot lower this time around, which often leads to cost-cutting features as tacky sets and frequent close-ups by the cameraman. The cinematography is extremely ugly, being frequently dark and lacking detail. The direction is very poor, with difficult to follow action sequences. The story is very garbled, as if linking footage that might have explained plot details was cut out or never filmed in the first place. But the biggest offender is how BORING the movie plays out. There's no suspense, no energy, and no enthusiasm by anyone in front of or behind the camera.\n\nIf the producers wanted to appeal to the Chinese market, they would have been better off giving more control of this movie to Chinese filmmakers. Right now on Netflix, there are a number of Chinese movies and television shows that offer some great entertainment, and show that Chinese filmmakers can make great action and drama. But as it is, while some audiences in China or elsewhere may be suckered into watching this sequel as I was, I think that they will be greatly disappointed, and subsequently ignore the upcoming second sequel. I certainly will."

And most annoying of all is that the audience is being treated as idiots, by having chinese people speak english to one another, which makes NO sense and ruins what little immersion there is, making ou have to \"re-set\" when the patronizing whitewash finally ends. If you manage to get past that, there's decent hand to hand fight scenes, but apart from that, most of the action is pure scifi, again, ruining immersion. I like most of Stallone's movies including the prequel to this shlock, and Batista has become one of my favorite actors,and I DID enjoy the scenes with the two together, but that doesn't rescue this accident of a movie, because the plot is all over the place, the cinematography is bad and so is the editing, and did I mention CHINESE PEOPLE SPEAKING ELNGLISH TO EACH OTHER..?

Luckily, movies like this are generally easy to spot from a mile away, long before even watching them, where them being good would be the real and actual surprise, so I had absolutely no high expectations, nor was I disappointed with how terrible this movie is; it was exactly as I figured it would be.\n\nThough the first outing, 2013's Escape Plan, was not too bad and rather enjoyable, with Arnold Schwarzenegger adding some authentic charm, 50 Cent was terrible in it, and he continues to be just as abysmal and flat in this instalment. The man simply cannot act, though he can somehow appear palatable to a point where it seems like he is at least alright.\n\nDave Bautista was average, while his character felt incredibly random, and for Stallone, I feel this movie, and franchise, is a \"why not\" type of involvement for him, or maybe even a favor. His performance was okay with a splash of lazy, which I doubt he was too bothered about, while Huang Xiaoming seemed to have given it his all, but sadly his all wasn't great at all. The story is a repeat for the most part that even felt thin on this occasion, the CGI came straight out of PlayStation 2, and the directing was simply, bad, with dreadful action sequences.\n\nThis movie is an unsurprising 3.4/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "I Am Huge Fan of Stallone and Schwarzenegger First (2013) Escape Plan Great Movie i really loved it. But this still has Stallone it's still great and having Dave Bautista it's great to have him in movie i enjoyed him he kicks ass in movie he is very entering to watch in movie, and i didn't expect Sequels for Escape Plan but i saw this i am like what ? really did Stallone escape already ? how many times is Stallone is going to get out of prison ? but anyway for me i liked sequel it's a lot of fun it's VERY Slaright Forward Action, i really understand people got pissed off Escape Plan 2 i understand it but i saw movie i enjoyed it everyone got different opinion of opinion but just because Critics say this is crap just watch movie then at end of day you make choice it's not really bad as what you think of Critics write. now i had a lot of fun with this movie. i knew what was i getting into what it was a direct to DVD sequel of Escape Plan i was ok some people say oh this is REALLY BAD BAD i am like ok at end of day i enjoyed it so far it's just fun, good fun time to watch movie i would not say it's time waster i would say it's a lot fun. it's not as bad what everyone says. i had fun Stallone was their kicking ass a lot of action in movie so as Baustia i didn't like movie just for Stallone and Baustia it was just a lot fun very slaright forward action flick. the action was a lot of fun the script is maybe not the best but it's not silly script or dumb the script is good, it's a lot of fun action in film a lot of it, i rather say it's more quicker then first Escape Plan because first had a lot of action and Schwarzenegger nailed his role but in this movie it's a lot fun, very slaright forward then the first Escape Plan movie just moves on i think it's bit too short for people who wants more of sequel. i really wished this was not a direct to DVD film because this was directed buy Steven C Miller he made a lot of bad, bad, bad movies not this movie, this movie is good a lot of fun but he did kinda ruined Sequel for another people i liked movie all movies Steven C Miller made i liked Is Just Escape Plan 2 and Extraction the rest of movies he did crappy Bruce Willis movies was First Kill, Marauders, Nicholas Cage film Arsenal bad films but this in my opinion sequel of Escape Plan is good but i wish it wasn't direct to DVD film. Plot follows Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone) is now manages an elite team of security specialists trained in the art of breaking people out of the world's most impenetrable prisons. nothing after events from First Escape Plan nothing about Schwarzenegger character, you have new Asian character with talented Martial Arts Shu (huang xiaoming) know for IP Man 2, but rest of his movies he made is just Asian movies not well known for everything i wished it could be Donnie yen or Tony Jaa but Huang Xiaoming is eh nothing special about his acting but he wasn't annoying character he is a jail breaker as well, When his trusted operative, Shu Ren, is kidnapped and disappears inside the most elaborate prison ever built, now with prison isn't very huge like in first movie i wished it could be big Exactly like that but the prison is big but it's all feels like the film was set in an abandoned Laser Quest building. but not as what you think watch movie then you know what i mean. Ray assembles an elite team to assist in the rescue Shu in prison, i love Action scene in movie Trent Derosa (Dave Baustia) Guardians of Galaxy, Kickboxer: Vengeance, House of Rising Sun, Man with iron fist. is in this movie as second role of movie he is in it his their and their he is i can't say his not much but he is their kicking ass in scene i love in bar when Stallone and Basutia both kickass to kill couple bad guys. villains are aren't so good i thought villains sucked lame villain in movie Gregor Faust (Titus Welliver) known for Lost TV Show, Sons of Anarchy, Town, Argo, Man on Ledge he has been few movies, he is called ZOO keeper keeping his Prisoners like Animals in prison, and he isn't good villain he is not enjoyable not really good villain just nothing i really wished they could hired another actor as villain maybe could hired Johnny Messner or Daniel Bernhardt as villain lead villain have someone kickass with Stallone, elite team Luke (jesse metcalfe) known for Dallas, John Tucker Must Die, i am like ok i am not fan of that actor but he is bit wooden could hired Victor Ortiz could worked again each another like Expendables 3 but Jesse Metcalfe is eh he didn't suit in this movie, Abigail (Jamie King) is good, Curtis ''50 Cent'' Jackson Hush from first Escape Plan. team was ok not best but could Hired MMA Stars reason for Action film, UFC Fighter was in it not to much Tyron Woodley not much in movie only fights with Shu that's it.\n\nStallone Acting is good he looks like he is enjoying it not like in Reach Me where he looks beyond tired, and he's really slumming it in the first two acts, Stallone is good in movie.\n\nthe things i hated about this The effects are awful, the bad guy has an awful ulterior motive for his actions. he is very wooden, effects and CGI i am like god why did Steven C Miller directed this i mean he is not best to hire he is not best writer i would eh say he did ok with this movie it's fun slaright forward action film Stallone and Baustia for sure but Steven C Miller is bad director movie needs different director like Isaac Florentine he would have done this movie better or i wished Stallone could written the sequels all of it he is director he hasn't directed movie since Expendables (2010) Stallone could make things a lot and a lot better then to Steven C MIller can't direct for crap i liked movie but it doesn't block me to hate over for director. Stallone has not been more hands on -or more passionate about any other projects he has been involved in. Its pure octane, its fight after fight, guns slinging, hard knocking flick headlined by Stallone in top form. Its not my favorite Stallone film and Basutia film but movie is eh good movie, a good pacing film it didn't suck. still disgusted at the CGI, It could have been better. it has a great twist in middle of movie, 8.10 love action scenes a lot of fun, Stallone and Baustia Rocked in movie it's great and it's fun but hey it's not best but still a lot fun it's worth for your time, it's good to see Sequel it's not bad like what Critics Say how it is, like i said in end of day it's your choice, don't trust Critics it's wrong, it's your choice if you liked movie or not. some characters don't really have much development and some of the tech stories can be a little confusing, never the less it's an enjoyable movie, Sly is great and has his trademark voice and confident attitude, the links to the first movie make a good follow up to the original and I am certainly looking forward to Escape Plan 3 Devils Station."

Where ironically, during the climax of the movie, it moved too fast and didn't allow some of the scenes to develop.

        "review_detailed_main": "Is this a sequel or a separate film that has no connection to the original movie?\n\nThat's the issue here. When a film succeeds and gains popularity, the creators decide to produce a sequel and turn it into a film series. However, the second part often fails due to exploiting the success of the first part, relying on its reputation while neglecting the story, plot, and direction. This results in a poor-quality film that ruins everything built by the original. Such is the case with this disastrous film, which tells the story of a man named Ray who owns a company specialized in discovering prison loopholes that make it easy to escape. It's a different story and had potential for success, but then comes the second part, which barely features anyone from the first except Sylvester Stallone and 50 Cent. The new film's story is unrelated to the previous one except for the idea of prison escapes, which is poorly executed. Sylvester Stallone is sidelined, and the focus shifts to a new hero who gets imprisoned in a supposedly secure prison but decides to escape and fails miserably, searching for hope to escape this hell called Hades. The plot is weak, the story unsatisfying, the direction poor, and the graphic scenes are of the lowest quality. The antagonist lacks value, background, or clear motivation-yes, revenge, but even that motivation isn't properly justified.\n\nThis film is considered one of Sylvester Stallone's worst, if not the worst, according to him personally regretting his involvement. My rating for it is 4 out of 10.\n\nNote: Do not watch this film unless you're interested in watching worst Sylvester Stallone movies."

Acting is also quite appropriate for a non-pretentious action movie. And the participants will make some money in-between large budget projects. So, it's OK. Much better than the majority of trash on the market and considerably worse than some Marvel action movies. I cannot say that I love it but it's likable.

        "review_detailed_main": "In the first couple of minutes of this movie you can tell how much effort were willing to put into it. The bullet special effects are ridiculous; like something you would see in a very low budget television show, and there is even a part where someone (I seriously can't remember a single persons name from this movie) gets electrocuted and I actually laughed when I saw the special effects for the electricity. There is simply no excuse for how poor the effects are, I really want to stress that because it's freaking 2018 for crying out loud. CGI should be practically indistinguishable from reality at this point in time. However, what we get instead is a complete backwards tumble to CGI from the year 2000.\n\nBut enough about the effects. Let's talk about the movie itself. The entire thing is expositional. Each scene exists in a linear fashion and serves no other purpose than to terribly propel the plot. There is no downtime for character progression. There is no progression. There is just \"I guess we need to put a scene here, so let's just regurgitate the first thing that comes to our mind.\" Half this movie is over before you even realize it. It's like a machine gun firing on full auto in terms of how fast the scenes are presented to the viewer. It's almost like the creators wanted the scenes to go by quickly just to keep people from noticing how crappy the story is-or keep them from realizing there is no story. \"These people need to fight each other for REASONS, why? Shut your mouth and give us your money!\n\nLook, I enjoyed the first movie. I thought it was actually a decent film. However, I really don't know what the hell happened in this. I even jokingly predicted that the next movie was going to be in Outer Space, and apparently that actually turned out to be true, because it's already in development. That's not a good thing. I shouldn't be able to jokingly predict your next move, while thinking of the stupidest idea that I possibly can. The fact that I was correct about it, is just an insult to your intelligence as writers and directors.\n\nGiving this a 1/10 and no that's not at all harsh. This movie should not exist. And until someone can explain to me why it does exist, my rating will stay at a 1."

Escape Plan 2 is like a sequel created by a computer algorithm, which is funny, because it is about a computer algorithm controlling the \"yet another most advanced prison in the world\". And it's more a Chinese film now, than an American one. Don't get me wrong, I liked that part, with the martial arts and the Sun Tzu like thinking. Only it was also really badly made as a story. It felt like a compilation of all the cinematics in a video game put on YouTube. The game would have been interesting, but it doesn't exist, while the cinematics are just like one would expect: rushed and not relatable.\n\nBottom line: if you started watching it, you probably like escape movies, so you will enjoy this, maybe. But look at the great cast: Stalone, Bautista, Wes Chatham (Amos from The Expanse), Xiaoming Huang (with great martial prowess)... even 50 Cent as a dorky hacker... ahem... Anyway, that potential was totally wasted in this film. And the escape itself? A clumsy, confusing affair, that made little sense."

This one is right up those trash buckets' alley. Stallone and \"The Animal\" Dave Bautista have secondary roles at best. If I had to count, I'd say Dave utters, maybe, 8-9 lines the entire movie, none of which are interesting or memorable. The movie itself is so ridiculous, illogical, and scattered. There's no substantial plot, no real point to what little plot exists beyond that unsubstantial mess, and anything remaining is as cheap and low-grade as you get. The entire movie is full of throwaway characters. When you do watch this, just count on six hands how many characters are in the movie yet have no actual point what so ever. For fun, I'll give you a quick start:\n\n\n\nYou could even argue 50 Cent, but I guess he does have a purpose in the film, and at leas this character contributes something, even as ridiculous as it is.\n\nApparently this Hades prison has no ability to stop wave-based signals either, for 2-way audio communication works just fine in this electrified floor setting. Really, the entire prison is a joke. It's security, its layout, its prisoners, the way its ran, the way the prisoners work ... none of it has any thought behind outside a couple of screen writers who drew the story out on a napkin over lunch. It is that shallow.\n\nLet's not even talk about the abysmmal \"shakey-cam\" all of these trash A-C level action movies have started abusing for the past 15 years. Or the lack of direction. Or the awful script. The poor dialogue. The vacant acting. The amateur cinematography...\n\nThere is no redeeming qualities to this movie--at all. You will watch it, you will (maybe) finish it. Subsequently, immediately, you will forget it after giving it a bad review, then proceed to delete it from your hard drive.\n\nAWFUL."

I sure felt his pain watching this movie.\n\nI liked the original Escape Plan, it was an interesting story. This was not interesting, It didn't really have a story although there was an attempt to teach a moral lesson. None of the actors were memorable, the dialogue was totally forgettable as well. I just felt pity for Stallone, he looked so old and he's still trying to do action pics well past his prime. He kind of reminds me of Brett Favre neither one of them could face the fact that their glory days are behind them and instead of staying out of the spotlight they crave just 1 more score. I don't understand it, if you have the money why not retire when you're on top and let your legend speak for you? It's crap like this that tarnishes what you used to be.\n\nIf you're a big Stallone fan and you feel like you have to see this movie, wait a month it will be on Netflix.

It follows Ray Breslin's protege who is imprisoned in a high tech prison run by robots. They are forced to fight each other in a Mortal Kombat style dojo in order to gain rations.\n\nIt's full of stupid moments that makes the first film look like a masterpiece. It repeats a lot things from that film from a set-up fight used as a distraction to a poorly conceived twist reveal towards the end. The digital effects look shoddy as if they were made using an iTunes app and the editing is wonky in places. It rips off films like Tron Legacy and The Hunger Games making it feel like a cheap looking parody.\n\nThe film is let down by a lame set up, predictable plot, bland characters and lazy writing. Don't let the film mislead you into thinking this is a Stallone/Bautista actioner as they are only in it for about 15 minutes. Instead it focuses on unknown actors who are not very good at acting (which is most likely because they used to be MMA fighters). The director does an okay job directing some of the action scenes, some of them are well choreographed however they suffer from the dreaded shaky-cam where we can barely see what is going on.\n\nThe film could have been a lot better if it was backed by a proper production company. It just looks cheaply produced as if it was made by a bunch of incompetent film students. It's let down by a bad story, a slow pace and lack of character development. In the end it's a loud, dumb fun guilty pleasure that (thankfully) runs at 90 minutes."

The way how bullets are coming out doesn't seem like real. So, I'd say it's kind of low quality film for a start.\n\nThe film itself doesn't seem like long. I can catch everything of the previous film. But this one, I don't understand a lot of things. Maybe it's just because of some people said the script has a problem.

Despite its very interesting premise the first film was very silly on occasion and made Arny and Sly look their age (unlike the Expendables franchise). We do get a new action star, in Xiaoming Huang, and the concept of the inescapable prison is taken further, although the criterion for who should be locked up is decidedly shaky. But that's always the rub with prisons isn't it. Perhaps it's time for a prison movie that actually questions the logic of keeping criminals in free board and accommodation (and increasingly generous facilities) while the taxpayers who are covering those costs have to work hard to obtain the same things. Surely there has to be some cost/benefit analysis so it doesn't become incarceration just for the sake of keeping criminals away from society?"

Oh there's another one\" How fake does that bruise look?? \"Did he just throw his cigarette at him??\" How fake was that explosion 10 mins in. He calls the movies big twist. \"Hahaha the zoo keeper!! Bit lame to call yourself the zoo keeper!!\" \"Oh my god he is such a bad actor!!\" He was referring to the main guys cousin!! \"That Chef is awful too!!\" Big fake laugh and eye roll at the \"It's bad to be back\" line The twist happens \"Oooh I was right!! Didn't see that coming!!\" Oh god HE is gonna fight the old man!! \"Let me guess that's what number 3 (which he didn't know there was) will be about\" He pulled a puzzled expression as the movie ended, as it's abrupt. Before saying \"What a great movie that was\" full of sarcasm.\n\nHe did like the main character's fight scenes!! Although I didn't, as it was mostly shaky cam and the quick cut that I hate!!\n\nFor my own amusement, I timed his screen time. He has 19 minutes 56 seconds (not counting his voice over) It seems like he is hardly in the movie during the first half, and then is in it a lot during the last half hour!! but in truth he has only slightly more in the last half hour, in the opening hour he is onscreen for just under 10 minutes, with the remaining 10 minutes coming in the lat half hour, but they use what they have well, and it seems like he is in it, a lot more than he actually is."

This make me Disgusting.\n\nEP1 is a great movie. i give 7/10 in imdb. EP2 just ruin Escape Plan series. In this film, the main actor is not Stallone or Bautista. In fact , the main actor is a china guy who named \"shu\" in the film. This film totally is a china-style film , china-style cgi , china-style arrogant. i can completely understand why this film not showing in US cinema.\n\nDont waste time on this film.\n\n-by Lee 9/7/2018"

It isn't a classic like First Blood or Predator but it's an enjoyable action/prison escape movie with decent action scenes and some genuine laugh out loud moments which felt like they were tailored for fans of the genre.\n\nEscape plan 2 is garbage. On the movie poster Stallone and Dave Batista (Hell yeah, let's go!) are front and centre so i went in to this expecting it to be a fun time. The actual star of the movie is some Chinese dude who i've never heard of (he is nowhere to be seen on the poster advertising the movie) and is also a bad actor with zero charisma\n\nStallone is more like a side character in his own movie and Batista is in it for about 10 minutes, he doesn't really do anything and the bad guys are all played by people who look and act like they're from a cheesy soap opera. The action scenes are shot in that annoying quick-cut headache inducing shakey style which i really hate and overall it's just dull.\n\nThe worst part is once the credits rolled i felt cheated. It's crap. Don't bother."

To round out the \"Expendables\" style cast we also have \"Curtis Jackson\" back as \"Hush\" & \"Jaime King\" as \"Abigail\" both who appeared in the first film. This story is about one of there own who turns \"bad\" & sets his old team mates up & locks them up in a brutal futuristic prison, this new lock-up is mesmerising to look at with it's colourful glowing neon lights everywhere like something out of \"Tron\" or \"Blade runner\" & with the Awesome pulsing electronic score that's straight out of the 80's sci-fi genre it's actually a really good well made action film, the fight scenes are excellent & brutal with blood & grit. This is actually one of the Coolest Action movies I've seen in a long time, there's something raw & retro about this sequel, the hypnotic lights & music completely sucked me into this dark & dangerous prison world, the visuals are stunning, often the film feels so dark with it's tough 80's style tone & moody atmosphere, it's an excellent low-budget movie & it's fine that \"Mr.Ego-Stallone\" is a bit part here because the younger team are an interesting bunch.\n\nA very good movie considering it's a straight to dvd sequel to a big budget cinema released film, Escape Plan 2 tries to be completely different from it's original & at that it succeeded, it's obviously not better than the brilliant first film but it's a million times better than the more dull & boring 3rd film, I'm surprised to hear that \"Stallone\" doesn't like part 2 at all & considers part 3 to be way better? Know idea how? Or why? Escape plan 3: Hades is a visually stunning sci-fi action Thriller made by what seems to be a visionary director, I'm going by the excellent style of this film, \"Stallone\" is good as \"Ray Breslin\" again but he's not the big main part & maybe that's why he didn't like it? Because in part 3 it's more his lead role again!!! Oh i have to say that i was impressed with \"Jesse Metcalfe\" in an action role, he's actually really good & is one of the better characters of the movie!!! Anyway i really enjoyed part 2 & it was a good choice giving the main lead part to \"Huang\" as Shu Ren, the guy is a total tough nut & a good moody & ready to strike action lead."

I actually somewhat liked the first 'Escape Plan' movie starring Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger. It was nothing brilliant, but at least it had some entertainment value.\n\nThe same can't be said about the sequel, though. Many would give up after about 20-30 mins, but I decided to see how low its score would drop on the scale by the end of it. Well, the answer is: very low.\n\nFirst of all, the plot and the writing is terrible - the story and the opening sequences make little to no sense. At one point I just gave up on trying to make any sense out of it and just wanted to see the \"brilliant\" conclusion, which was (unsurprisingly) weak and felt rushed, but at that point I was happy it was over. All of this is only made worse by the awful acting. If you just look at the names on the cast you might find some well-known names like Dave Bautista, Jaime King and Jesse Metcalfe, but it's all a trap. I wonder if they now regret having this movie on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Throughout the movie the acting is so stiff that it just doesn't bring any interest in any of the characters. The viewer just never really cares or roots for the supposed good guys nor despises the actions of the bad guys that's how plain they are.\n\nIn this sequel Sylvester Stallone is back playing Ray Breslin - one of the main guys of the first movie, however the role of his character is diminished to the point where he might be better off being left out of it. But even if he had the main role, it wouldn't help much to save this movie. It just feels that Sylvester is getting too old for this action/tough guy business - we've just seen too many of these already.\n\nSetting aside the acting part, I actually found the camera work to be decent for my taste, unfortunately in the final cut it's meshed with some poor CGI, which spoils the only thing that might be considered positive about this movie.\n\nIn short recap, yes, you can find some shootouts, a car chase and plenty of fight scenes in the movie, but it's all just one big, MEH! It's an empty shell with no substance. If you haven't seen the first movie then I'd recommend watching that one instead, otherwise - avoid!"

But he's patented it.... so it's sort of in the public domain already and he just wants to monetize it. Point is, it's out there and available. Otherwise it would've just been a secret program he had/was developing.\n\nThat's a minor point really, it's supposedly an action movie so having a poor plot is par for the course sometimes.\n\nThe prison that wants to keep it's VALUABLE prisoners who are filled with information that they want to extract .... yeah, let's have them do some bare knuckle fighting, because no one ever gets hurt doing that.\n\nThen there's the \"reward\" of TWO hours with some art supplies. Why??? What purpose does it serve.\n\nThe prison has what must be a rotating cell block setup, as one guy walks 2 different distances to the kitchen. Which is also just a superfluous bit of info as nothing ever comes of it.\n\nMaybe I missed it but this super top secret prison with robots for guards and a mystery of a food delivery system, has a lot of things being delivered to the prisoners, notes, remotes, more notes... the outside team doesn't even know where the prison IS, let alone the supply companies, OR how/who to get their extra supplies to inside the prison even if they did know.\n\nThen just prior to the final showdown, mystery shadow figure business man, who is on a life size panel screen on the wall, watches Breslin and Kimbral meet up, then goes away??? Only to turn on a different screen later on and \"oh wait, you're not Kimbral....\" as if he expected a more positive outcome.\n\nAll in all, this was a pretty terrible movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Escape Plan 2: Hades\" is the 2018 sequel to the original \"Escape Plan\" film, and unfortunately, it struggles to live up to its predecessor. While the first film was a thrilling and entertaining action movie, the sequel feels lackluster and uninspired by comparison.\n\nThe plot of the film follows Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone) and his team of security experts as they are hired to rescue a group of kidnapped tech moguls from a highly advanced and automated prison called Hades. However, the film's plot is convoluted and confusing, with too many characters and subplots that never quite come together in a satisfying way.\n\nOne of the major issues with \"Escape Plan 2\" is the lack of chemistry and charisma among the cast. Stallone is still a force to be reckoned with on screen, but the rest of the ensemble feels flat and uninteresting. Additionally, the action sequences are lackluster and poorly choreographed, lacking the excitement and energy of the first film.\n\nThat being said, \"Escape Plan 2\" is not a complete disaster. There are some redeeming qualities, such as the visually stunning design of the Hades prison and the inclusion of interesting new technologies and gadgets. But ultimately, these elements can't save the film from feeling like a lackluster imitation of its predecessor.\n\nOverall, \"Escape Plan 2: Hades\" is an okay movie, but it pales in comparison to the exciting and entertaining original. If you're a die-hard fan of the first film, you may enjoy this sequel, but otherwise, it's not worth seeking out."

The first Escape Plan was thrilling, it was what was promised. But this movie was so bad that i might consider this the worst movie i've seen. The action doesn't even seem like it's in a cinematic movie, the solutions to the problems are stupid. And it is so fast paced that it becomes weird. Just save your money."

Star Sylvester Stallone returns as a security expert who must enter an inescapable prison yet again, in order to rescue one of his team who's trapped there. Dave Bautista replaces Arnold Schwarzenegger in this sequel, while Huang Xiaoming, Wes Chatham, Jesse Metcalfe, Jaime King, Chen Tang and Titus Wellive also join the cast. 50 Cent reprises his role from the original movie as well. It was directed by Steven C. Miller and it was written by Miles Chapman (who also co-wrote the first film). The movie was released directly to video in the U.S., and it's gotten mostly negative reviews from critics. I found it to be mostly entertaining.\n\nRay Breslin (Stallone) has built a new team of security experts. One of them has lost his trust though, Jaspar Kimbral (Chatham), so he fires him. Shortly later, another one of Ray's team, named Shu (Xiaoming), goes missing. Ray believes he's being held in a new inescapable fortress like prison. So he gets himself locked up again, in order to get his friend out.\n\nThe movie is pretty routine Stallone action fun, so I enjoyed it. Once again, he's casting an ensemble of younger (and hipper) actors as his costars though. I'm fine with that here. Still, as I look back at the movie now, it definitely wasn't that good (I realize now). I did like it while I was watching it though, and I'd definitely still recommend it to a Stallone movie fan."

The editing and camera work is jerky and shoddy, too many close ups hiding the low budget and a plot which is just various scenes stitched together. There is another unescapable prison, but Stallone isn't even in the prison until the final 20 minutes. I am unsure why this film was greenlit as it has nothing new to say over the first film, and at times has a sci-fi vibe to it which just comes across as bizarre.

It's not easy to compete with the pair Stalone + Arnold especially when the cast does not include big or established names outside of them. Main characters feel shallow, the prison is too futuristic and the mechanisms feel too complex and not like a prison at all as it's more about the Arena than the cells and the system itself. The flow is kind of confusing for the viewer and the plot is not deep at all. It's good that the movie is 1 and a half hour long. Action movies usually should not be more more than 100'. The fighting scenes are okay and enjoyable for the casual fan. Some of the dialogue and the escape sequences can be considered fun.\n\n\u270d It's a decent movie at best, but watchable nevertheless. You might enjoy it yet not get filled by enthusiasm, every film needs the proper expectations. If this one did not act like a clickbait with the major names being promoted, maybe it would have done better because the hype hurted it but it's not that bad after all. Just nothing special. 5.5/10"

But now that I have watched ut...twice...I must say that I was actually pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed it. Yes, its made on a low budget. But they made the most out of the bucks...it looks ok for the most part (minus a terrible cgi explosion in the beginning wtf). They made the top secret prison facility look really cool...loved the robot. Think Running man ! Actually the stylish look of the movie and the very, very cool (!) retro 80's synth score makes this a fun and cool B-movie experience. The style, score and overall atmosphere reminds me somewhat of Beyond the black rainbow (something I never expected of a Sly movie). I was even surprised Sly had as much screentime as he did...he was a major part of the movie, eventhough not as much as in the original. I must admit he does come across as a little tired and uninterested...he does seem to phone it in little, probably not the most exciting project he was ever part of. But he is a professional and delivers ok. The story, characters and the flow of the story...could have been better for sure. Its not a 10 star movie, but Im giving it 10 to balance all the ridiculous 1 star reviews. If you are a fan of stylish cyberpunk B-movies you might want to give it a chance."

But this does nothing more than repeat the plot, do it with a much smaller budget, the characters barely offer interest and everything appears so forced and unbelievable that indignation and disbelief grow minute by minute. Not only that; Besides, we have Stallone who appears very little on the screen and when he doesn't appear everything, it's truly pathetic. It's a bad movie with just five minutes of good work. The ending offers words similar to those of Liam Neeson in Taken. It is not good."

I think this is more of a 6-8, but not as bad as many have stated. 15 minutes in I was thinking, what the heck am I watching. This is not at all like the first escape plan, in fact Stalone plays a minor role at least initially, so much so, that I was feeling this was just a way for the studio to make a quick buck off of the first escape plan and billing it as another Stalone movie. Even the opening scene is much more gritty than the first, almost like Zero dark thirty. I started thinking maybe they are trying to go for a higher caliber setup, but then seemed to fissile for a bit. However if you sit through it, it's more of a chess game. Sure there are plenty of plot holes and if you blink things can get confusing, however, the acting is pretty good and the overall plot and twists are enough to carry it through. Overall I ended up enjoying the movie and getting into it much more than I expected from the opening. The ending is a layup for another movie, which I immediately suspected would not happen as I know many will not like this movie at all. However, I an see on IMDB that #3 is already in the works and yes I will plan to see it, albeit maybe when it's on video, guess we'll see."

It ended being a competent movie that left a lot to be desired from its main cast especially lacking action.\n\nFor the sequel gone is Arnold and even Stallone kinda take a backseat. The movie is mostly about Xiaoming Huang's character Shu. As for Batista? He is in the movie even less than Stallone. Its pretty obvious they where going for a much smaller budget this time and it show. Even if the prison is more high tech in a way than the one in the first movie, it does seem much cheaper made.\n\nWhat for me tought saved the movie was Xiaoming Huang action scenes. The dude is pretty good at martial arts and weird enough, you could almost consider this sequel to Escape Plan as a martial arts movie.\n\nI think the fans of Stallone will be a bit disapointed and maybe even the fans of Batista, as there role are much smaller than the cover poster would let you believe, but if you can pass over that and apreciate the movie for what it is, and if you enjoy on screen martial arts, i think you should had a good time with this movie."

There is no hard coded subtitles and all their names feel like \"fighdhfg\" and \"dhigfhdfgb\". I couldn't care less who is in it from the poster if it's a good story it's a good story regardless if it's actually Sly escaping these over the top prisons or not. The director just wanted the movie to look pretty for the visuals and everyone looked in dire need of a shower. Granted you're not going to look like a movie star in jail but I don't know.\n\nIf he was going to out source everyone to be in a team why not spend the first little while training a team or something so it's easier to process who is who and actually focus on the story. The first 5 or so minutes I wasn't sure if I was watching the right movie. You know the movie was going to bomb though when there was half a dozen production teams.\n\nI think I spent more time writing this review than watching the movie. 0 out of 10. The only thing you'll want to escape is the movie theater. Why even call it escape plan if Sly just makes such brief cameos."

In 2018 what this really tells you is that the official release was not in the US -- who still watches DVDs in the US? A little bit of research will tell you that this was mostly financed by Chinese investors, which is why the main star of the movie is Chinese. Basically the story is Chinese with foreign actors that were filmed in China, yet then some filming with the Escape Plan actors was filmed in the US and then integrated into the movie. Are the US actors and foreign actors ever on the same screen with each other? If so it is limited. Knowing this, you should compare this movie with other movies of the same caliber... Chinese action/martial arts movies. The \"Escape Plan\" skin is just to give it some credibility in the US with minimal effort by the US actors. This is very common in sequels that aim to setup a franchise.... Stallone announced a 3rd movie and it will most likely be a great movie if it is based in the US and not as liked in China, or a great movie if based in China and not as liked in the US. Either he wants to be serious with the franchise (which we will know how serious if he, 50-Cent, and Bautista are in the next film). All of this being the case here, one should watch this movie out of the eyes of a fan of 80's action beat-em-up mixed with 90's action martial-arts mixed with cheap fX, older action stars that don't move around that much anymore because they are like 80 years old (yeah, seriously.... can you do backflips even at 55??), and the introduction of new actors/actresses in hopes that they can make a career and Stallone can make some money off of the whole thing. The dude is brilliant when it comes to creating and maintaining franchises and stretches them out for decades to make millions and millions of dollars---- Rocky (with the new film coming out this year it will be 42 years of movies), Rambo (with the new film coming out in 2019 it will be 37 years of movies), The Expendables has been running 9 years already with the new movie slated for next year, Escape Plan will be on its 6th year next year, and don't forget that Stallone owned the late 80's early 90's action genre with roughly 10 blockbuster movies that made almost a billion dollars combined. What does all of this say??? It says that he knows what he is doing as an actor and as a film maker. Having a little bit of understanding how Hollywood operates it is easy to see that this movie isn't really Escape Plan: Hades.... it is Escape Plan in China: Hades. This movie is easily a 5 star movie. If you love Stallone you will like this movie. If you love 50-Cent you will enjoy his cameos. And if you like Chinese martial arts with very colorful gadgetry (ever been to Asia?!) then you will really like this movie. The movie is not a 1 star. But it is not a 10 either. Somewhere in the middle is just."

The lead of the film is a Chinese actor named Xioming Huang, which works out fine as his acting is pretty decent and his fighting skills are good. I was wondering why this did'nt hit theaters here in the US, I guess that is why. Bautista's got limited screen time as well, but his performance is memorable. This is in no way an equal to the 1st film, but for what it is, it is not bad at all. Escape Plan 2 is a bit more sci fi then the original film, but in a lot of ways it is similar and uses the same formula. You certainly could do a lot worst for direct to video action and some action movies that did go the theater, this is a lot better than Expendables 3 in my opinion."

        "review_detailed_main": "Escape Plan 2: Hades: 3 out of 10: Sylvester Stallone runs a firm that breaks people out of prison. After a job goes bad the team breaks up only to be brought back together when a new secret prison, the titular Hades, threatens one of their own.\n\nThe Good: Dave Bautista is fun for the three minutes or so he is in the movie. I also like the way the sets are a throwback to the Full Moon pictures of the 1980's with all the neon and bad special effects.\n\nThe Bad: Dave Bautista is the only fun interesting character in the movie. The way he has been arguing with Disney we may see him in a lot more direct to video films like this. His loss is honestly our gain.\n\nThe movie Cube managed a much more effective future prison look on a much smaller budget twenty years ago. I found the sets and special effects hilariously bad. I am not sure the filmmakers really meant that.\n\nThe Ugly: To say this movie's plot makes no sense is an understatement. The futuristic prison contains advanced technology (healing robots, virtual reality etc) that is certainly more profitable to market to the outside world than the current kidnap people and makes them fight so they will reveal the industrial secrets business plan. It is like one of those movies where the bad guy invents a ray that can control the weather and then decided to use it to rob a bank.\n\nIn Conclusion: I have not seen the first Escape Plan but I understand it isn't that bad a movie. Why they thawed out Sylvester Stallone for this junk I have no idea. This is clearly one of those international co-productions meant for foreign audiences. This is not always a bad thing. Bloodrayne is an awful movie filled with international stars but it is also a fun movie filled with sex, violence and hammy acting. This honestly has no action, nudity or violence. Just a bunch of nobodies wandering around a set from 1980's The Apple while some American stars pop in for glorified cameos. More purgatory than Hades I am afraid."

The scenes and settings change so quickly and are so disjointed throughout the movie, that in the end the spectator is left with a bored anticipation only a 1h30 long trailer could accomplish.\n\nDialogue is so badly written that one could watch the movie without any of it, and come out with the exact same understanding of the plot.\n\nUnlike in the first movie, where the catharsis is brought by the characters discovering what and where the prison is, the ending here is so lackluster and blatantly set up to be continued in a third, possibly even worse sequel, that it makes this one of the worst movies I have ever watched.\n\nAnd the worst thing about it? It's not one of those \"movies so bad they make you laugh\". It's just cringe inducingly bad.\n\n2/10 because set design wasn't bad, and CGI, while low-budget, is sparingly used and isn't as bad as some other reviewers make it out to be."

        "review_title": "This movie is so bad that we should be naming and shaming the individuals responsible",
        "review_detailed_main": "Honesty I am shocked above all. The first escape plan was such a good movie. Everything about it was interesting, new and unique and enjoyable to watch with a great cast! There is nothing to suggest that a sequel could have done this badly.\n\nI don't think it is merely a coincidence that this movie did as badly as it did. There were some very, VERY poor decisions made throughout the movie which resulted in this complete and utter train wreck and embarrassment of a sequel to be produced. I honestly think movies that do this badly are on another level of bad, and the people responsible should be named and shamed and sacked immediately as they are clearly not suited to the movie industry. Sure, everyone makes mistakes, but such an accumulation and frequency of them in such a high magnitude points to a very unsuitable individual in the movie industry. So I had another look into the details to help me understand how this all could have gone wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at the cast. Yes, some of the acting was dry and bad, but there were 3 amazing actors part of the cast which should have boosted the appeal by a great deal. So why didn't it? Well, it could be because the main and loved actors were barely featured in the movie. Now this could be down to poor writing of the movie but when we look at Miles Chapman's previous works including escape plan 1, they were largely great hits and there were few major problems in his writing that could lead to this being produced. Even with gaps in the movie plots and a poorly thought out scene can easily be amended if the director and other writers have any half of a brain to do so to still transform the movie into something great. We see this all the time and movies are never the same as books, but rather key scenes put together to tell us roughly the same story in a logical and well thought out way.\n\nI began focusing my attention on the director of this movie. Some unknown guy called Steven C. Miller. Have you ever heard of him? Nope, neither have I. At first glance, this guy is a 5 foot 5, beerbellied, overtattood man with a terrible track record in the past. After observing his previous works, just one of his movies has scored over a rating of 5/10, and even that was a close call as well. So what were people expecting hiring this man? That suddenly he would produce a masterpiece as good as the first movie when he barely has produced a watchable movie in the past on not even half the budget this movie had? I honestly think this is where the movie goes wrong. Whoever was responsible for hiring this complete clown essentially ruined the franchise from day 1, and seeing the result, I can't be surprised that Steven C Miller cannot cope with such a big movie as this, considering his past works are a complete joke and taunt to good movie directors. The poor efforts and abilities of this man have resulted in a terrible unwatchable tragedy of a movie, and this man should never be allowed to work on a film again as he has proven time and time again of how incapable and how unsuitable he is for directing.\n\nIn conclusion, I think this movie failed for a large number of factors, but the largest of all, the one which put this movie in the top 100 worst ever movies of all time, was the incapable and unintelligent director (should not even have the privilege of being called one), Steven C Miller, who's terrible sense of directing and track record resulted in one of the most catastrophic failures from a good franchise I have ever witnessed in my life. This man should be sacked and fined for his terrible work, and I think this movie should be remade with the same director from the first movie before you guys go ahead and make the third because this is unacceptable garbage that fans cannot possible ever want, no matter how hard they try to bare it."

While impressive to shoot a full feature in that amount of time it would be more impressive if the feature was actually good. . Which this was not. If you came here for reviews before watching this film...don't. You will be disappointed. Go back and watch the first one instead. I'll be latching for 3 to reunite original cast."

        "review_detailed_main": "Escape Plan 2: Hades. Sharp descent. Considered a classic of the prison drama genre, The Shawshank Redemption forever changed the way audiences viewed the subject. The film \"Escape Plan 2: Hades\", however, was not so successful. Director Stephen S. Miller failed to repeat the success of his predecessor, and the second part of the franchise seemed much weaker and secondary to the audience. Despite an impressive cast, including Sylvester Stallone and Dave Bautista, the script wasn't compelling enough and the plot pacing wasn't up to par. Erratic editing and a confusing plot make Escape Plan 2: Hades feel unbalanced and difficult to understand. However, it is worth noting that the film still has its positive aspects: detailed fight and pursuit scenes, high-quality choreography and visual effects make it quite spectacular and dynamic. \"Escape Plan 2: Hades\" may certainly interest action fans and Stallone fans, but the overall impression of the film remains rather controversial due to shortcomings in the plot and direction."

I liked the first one - it wasn't no mindblowing cinematic achievement, but it was fun to see Arnie and Sly team up and they actually looked like they were enjoying making that movie, which turned out as a solid piece of action.\n\nThis one, however, seemed more like a 'leftover' side scripted first one. Acting wasn't that great, but what can you do, even Brando couldn't pull this one off with those scripted lines. I had trouble getting through the movie itself, since it's pace was so non-linear (even though, that can be good sometimes, trust me, this time it wasn't). Sly was barely in this movie, pushed more to the side role in the first half. Even Bautista appearing here and there, with that actor from Desperate housewives didn't help this movie. Script was just so vague. Sly looked like he just had to do this one, for no real reason at all - there's a third part coming soon aswell. I give it a merciful 5, since the soundtrack (retro 80s nuances) and some fight scenes from the begining were alright, 50 and DH dude weren't bad either, but everything else is just bad. Looks more like a TV movie, even though the cinematography and editing were done nicely."

It undermines your perceptions at every opportunity. Actually,, what decade is it supposed to be? With its contemporary 2018 setting soon becoming a garish abundance of neon, and a plinky plonky 80's electronic soundtrack.\n\nYes, there's a bit of an 1980's revival since the wonderful 80's themed Strange Days, but to me, instead of accomplishing that feeling of being returned to those wondrous days of youth, it's was more like being dragged back to my parents first divorce. What about the plot I hear you cry? The plot holes make Swiss cheese look like that big lump of mature cheddar that has sat at the back of the fridge since before you can remember, but you don't have the heart to throw out. It's like a cacophony of familiar household noises. The ones that wake you up in the middle of the night with the feeling that you are either being burgled by a rhino, or the dogs going through the bins. I would love to read the script, to see what the writer's original idea was, and if it started off as a good idea and was then put through the studio's equivalent of Banksy's Girl with Balloon.

I don't know why they thought this was a good idea, but a shakey camera constantly too zoomed into the characters face throughout the movie not only made it difficult to follow what was going on, but literally made me sick by the end of the movie and ended up puking as soon as i left the cinema.

Loved the first one and even though had slightly corny parts the film was a solid 7/10, trouble is if your major Stallone fan like myself in that painful hour I experienced I think he featured possibly 10/15 mins in it and kept switching the plot to the main character. Don't watch and don't even think about escape plan 3!!"

What else can one ask for?\n\nLadies and gentleman, we are talking Sylvester \"Sly\" Stallone, an ICON of action movies who, many newcomers movie goers wouldn't know, starred in Rambo, Rocky I-IV and The Specialist along Sharon Stone.\n\nThen we have Dave Bautista - brawn meets intellect- where an alpha male the size of Koko the Gorilla solves Rubik's Cube faster than Will Smith's character in Pursuit of Happyness.\n\n50 cent stars as a 'sly' ... (get it?) higher-tier consultant or something of the firm and is relatively restrained for all his chutzpah and Crack-A-Bottle soundtrack.\n\nThe movie portrays, projects and extrapolates what it would be like in futuristic prison. Gone are the days of Salinas County Jail and what not. We have AI-driven, robotics who take care of an entire engine that is called Hades (underground.. see your Greek Mythology).\n\nI was a big fan of Stallone in the first Escape Plan where he wrote a dissertation about the structural engineering of the prison and the same intellect, level-headedness, coolness and wit (such as Go scene) is present in the sequel.\n\nEach shots are cinematographic masterpiece and not your typical Instagram filters. Sure critics will say the delivery is wooden, or complaint of the ropey dialogue or abrumpt jumping of scenes or lack of storylines and numerous other plotholes... but the end the of the day this is not your average Fast and The Furious meets Prison Break meets Tolstoy's War and Piece.\n\nIn fact, some of the robotics scene alone is worth the movie entrance and budget of many Hollywood films. Only Hollywood can provide insight and glimpse into superior graphics, visualization and VFX as to what a futuristic prison will look like with hi-tech gadgets.\n\nBravo. Well done folks. Take a bow. It may not be an Oscar material but sure HP Lovecraft, Jules Verse and even Robert Heinlein and Asimov (as in conjoined Robert Heinlein and Asimov in an alterante universe) could have foreshadow'd such master piece.\n\nWith all aplogies to Shakespeare:\n\nIf Escape Plan Franchise is the.food of love, play on!!\n\nPlay on!"

One year later. \"The first escape plan\" was a Paramount film with well molded acting, featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger, and a movie that actually showed equivalency pertaining to great acting and a shadow two legends acting humorous and very solidified the entire film. The second one was to matrix fantasy type for me to actually dig into I actually skip that least 10 minutes of the movie due to lack of interest.

To the lead actor, just because you're semi good-looking does not mean you don't need to act, this is still a movie with some big name actors (even though they just appear for 10 minutes). Not worth it to watch, even if someone paid me."

        "review_detailed_main": "Any action movie fan is probably familiar with this film's hilariously bad reputation. People just hate it. With a passion. And it's hilarious.\n\nYes, ok, yes. It's bad. Cheap-looking, cheaply executed entertainment with meh acting and an overwrought story that can't just pick a lane genre-wise. It's an action thriller, with a bit of a sci-fi element that doesn't really work (the prison is futuristic and high tech), making it look like a Doctor Who (2005) episode.\n\nIt may be the worst of Sylvester Stallone's career, which is sad because he still has charisma and physicality. I love Dave Bautista, and was excited to see him and Stallone doing their thing together, even if Arnold's absence is still damaging to the movie's appeal. Sadly, Bautista is barely in it. He is in like, three or four scenes total, and he only has two action scenes, in which all he really does is shoot some dudes. Sylvester Stallone strangely isn't in it as much as he should be, though I guess he's there a fair amount. But when he gets top-billing, he should appear way more than a fair amount. It's horribly underwhelming.\n\nThe action sequences are the movie's saving grace, and that's not saying much. There are some well-choreographed fight scenes, a cool bar shootout where Stallone and Bautista kill bad guys, and some good sequences at the end. Sly does have a brutal final fight, which is cool. The violence is pretty graphic, but not OTT.\n\nXiaoming Huan is a great martial artist tho. He takes center stage for much of the movie with lots of cool kung fu-oriented fight scenes. My problem isn't that he's so central, it's that he's central at the expense of Stallone and Bautista. It's like when you're at a concert for a band you love, and you really like the opener band, but then you realize they have the majority of the concert's length. No matter how good they are, they're not who you're there for.\n\nIt's just kind of a mess. The script is muddled, the action is well-done but kind of underwhelming, the two great leads are barely present, and the villains are completely forgettable. It might be really hard to like for a lot of people, and this is as forgiving a review as I can give. It's definitely not the worst movie I've ever seen, like it seems to be with so many other people. It's still better than the DTV garbage Steven Seagal is still putting out."

Yes, good old days (hmmmm... I'm only 29! What is old days!?)\n\nFrom Stallone you expect always one thing - action, action and action! And a little drama (remember Rocky?). Yes, he can this. But in my heart he always a fearless hero. Besides, I liked another his characters in comedy.\n\nBut, Escape Plan. The first movie was good. Not excellent, but you have this \"warm\" feelings after film. For me, there are three basis of success: good actors, good story and good atmosphere. And Escape Plan partly has everything. Good actors - well, there are \"stars of 90th\" Stallone and Schwarzenegger. Good story - well, neither new, nor very interesting, but with some charm. Good atmosphere - yes for me.\n\nAnd from second part I expected two things - Stallone and good atmosphere. And... got nothing.\n\nThe story is very similar to old Plan with some modification. In the centre of plot two Asian brothers, one of which work for Stallone's company. But there no interest for looking at all acting. The actors are washy and their characters are similar.\n\nTwo pillars of movie - Stallone himself and Bautista, hadn't time and willing to show themself in full force. Sly has a little time maybe of his age. Well, but I turn on this movie because of him! And Bautista... Well, Bautista is Bautista. He is weak as actor and you can use him as one-time characters, such as: \"This is Bautista! Wow!\". And then forgot about him. His best role is in the Guardians of the Galaxy as Drax the Destroyer. This is mean something, if you understand me.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is weird. Creators thought about future prison as collection of dark with color lights, robots and holograms. But this is more hiding bad fantasy, then showing \"future\".\n\nThe movie is so \"peaceful\", that showing only minimum of the minimums of blood. You know, this \"piu-piu\" sound and etc. But in the last scene we can look at the beaten face of Sly.\n\nMain villain - are your joking?! He is so cute and useless, that you can't perceive him seriously. Sorry, pal. Even plot twist (if we can call it such word) can't help.\n\nI expected for trap, but not so big! Sorry Sly, but we can't eat this.\n\nOnly 2 Sly from 10."

But then he turns against the terrorists and helps the hostages escape. He also takes the time to destroy their weapons cache, which delays their escape and as a result one of the hostages ends up shot.\n\nBack in the US we learn this was an operation run by Breslin (Stallone) who ends up firing the one guy responsible for the delay the in the escape. This guy, Kimbral, was trying to modernize Breslin's operation with algorithms and according to one such algorithm they should have all made it out in time alive even with the destruction of the weapons.\n\nYears later, one of Breslin's team members, Shu, is tasked with protecting his brilliant tech-guru cousin. There is an attack and both end up taken prisoners in some high tech prison called HADES. The prison us run by no other than Kimbral but his investors want the technology that Shu's cousin developed so they're torturing him to the get the info. Kimbral developed the prison precisely so that not even Breslin could escape. Meanwhile another guy from the the team is captured and in HADES. So Breslin and 3 or 4 left on his team will have to figured out who to get their friends out, while those one the inside will have to figure out how to escape from a prison with no clear layout with the help of some other convicts. Eventually Breslin himself gets himself imprisoned to get the others out.\n\nNot sure Escape Plan ever needed a sequel but it certainly didn't need a C-movie sequel. For the first 20 minutes or so EP2 actually works that is until HADES is introduced. In HADES everything is obnoxiously dark except for some 80s special effects occasionally. It is probably the lamest movie-prison ever shown. How they paid whoever claimed to be a set-designer I don't know. But like all Chinese-coprodutions, this movie doesn't exactly aim for quality and excellence. There are some cool martial-arts scenes but then other action scenes are weak. The only cool thing are some robots since this is an automated AI-run prison. Bautista is in this movie, not kicking butt. Curtis Jackson not sure what his role is here. Escape Plan 2 offers little to the audience."

        "review_detailed_main": "Escape Plan 2: Hades (1 out of 5 stars).\n\nEscape Plan 2 is just pure horrible and nothing can describe why Sylvester Stallone would agree to being in this sequel. The first film was at least decent with him and Arnold Schwarzenegger costarring together and being in a movie were they have to work together to break out a maximum-security prison. However, this sequel fails to live up to the first movie. For starters, this film is a straight to dvd type of movie. You can expect it to be low quality this time. Sylvester Stallone is barely in this movie as well.\n\nThe plot is lame and dumb. It focuses on Shu Ren (Huang Xiaoming) who works for Breslin's security company and gets captured. And placed in a futuristic prison. Were the owner of the place is known as the zookeeper. And rewards the prisoners if they survive the fights. They have a robotic droid that is a medic in med bay. They have a hologram cell of your preferred setting. Shu is captured cause the owner of the prison wants something from Ren. That involves satellites. While Ray (Sylvester Stallone) and his team Abigail (Jaime King), Hush (Curtis Jackson), and newcomer Luke (Jesse Metcalfe) are trying to get in and to break out with Ren. The plot was all over the place. From the beginning scene was a failed mission of a break out. And a twist that is not as exciting. It was just bad.\n\nThe direction was horrible. The shootouts were terribly executed. Come on, guys are shooting at each other up front and the bullets are not hitting anyone or anything. It is like they are shooting blanks towards each other. The fight scenes are consisting of close up camera shots and quick editing cuts which does not help make it exciting.\n\nStallone should have passed on this sequel. Dave Bautista was a waste in this role. Appearing for a small amount of screen time. Huang Xiaoming gave a dull performance.\n\nOverall, Escape Plan 2: Hades is just pure terrible. A stupid plot. The concept is overkilled with a futuristic prison that has holograms, a rotating prison that changes its layouts, a robotic medic, and force field doors. Yes, it is ridiculous. The action and shootouts are badly executed. And sadly, it does have an ending that leaves for another sequel."

        "review_detailed_main": "While 2013's Escape Plan was no masterpiece, it did tap into the dumb-fun action movie vibe of the two leads' heyday. The film was a simple and entertaining enough B-grade actioner with Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger making a good team.\n\nAlthough it's likely that most missed it, 2018 saw the release of sequel Escape Plan 2: Hades starring Sylvester Stallone and Dave Bautista. The film went straight to DVD in the US and yet, despite it being a flop overall, a third installment is still currently in the works. The plot sees some of Ray Breslin's (Stallone) new recruits get kidnapped and thrown into Hades, a maximum security prison not unlike The Tomb from the last movie except it's always moving and shifting, making its layout hard to figure out, and some of the staff are actual robots.\n\nYes. Robots.\n\nBreslin attempts, with the help of his hacker friend Hush (50 Cent), former associate Trent (Dave Bautista) and others, to break his team out of Hades while Breslin's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Shu Ren (Huang Xiaoming), one of the prisoners, tries to understand the prison's inner workings. Eventually, everyone finds themselves in Hades and the real \"escape plan\" is finally put into motion.\n\nEscape Plan's premise should have been an easy one to bank on in continuing sequels. Essentially, you could have just had Breslin tackle different types of prisons with the help of Schwarzenegger or other big name co-stars with a new hammy, villainous warden every time. Somehow, however, Hades is a convoluted mess and neither Stallone or Bautista get much screen time. Both really come into play in the film's last third and, until that point, we're mostly spending time with Shu Ren and other new, far less charismatic and entertaining leads.\n\nThis movie feels more like the fourth or fifth movie in a tired franchise than it does a straight-up sequel. The plot never really takes off, the new characters are dull, the writing is terrible, the twists are uninspired and the film ends abruptly, without any real ending. While Bautista, when he's actually in the movie, is likable, the cinematography is at least competent and the prison's concept is appealing, this is all frankly half-assed.\n\nWhat could have been a light-hearted and fun sequel turns out to be a surprisingly miserable experience that should alienate both newcomers and fans of the original. In the same way that The Expendables ran out of steam with its third film, this one completely deflates after just one movie.\n\nAwful."

There are no interesting sets, no effects, no cool locations. Nothing. The \"prison\" is just a big room with dark edges so you cant really see whats going on. 3.

The film seems to have been filmed entirely in close-up. Sets are minimal and unimaginative. Most of the actors are bland and forgettable. It got so uninteresting I actually picked up book of poetry I bought about 15 years ago that I've been meaning to read."

I just can't understand how they were able to mess this one so bad. The acting is awful for the most part, there is no flow to the scenes, they're entirely disconnected, and the story is terrible. I gave it 3 stars because in that terrible story there is a plot twist which actually caught me by surprise and one action scene that was half-decent. Beyond that not worth it."
