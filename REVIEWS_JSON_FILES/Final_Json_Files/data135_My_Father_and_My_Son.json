The story may not be all that original but the way it is told is just wonderful. Lot's of humor (we laughed a lot) and real tragedy (we really needed that handkerchief at the end). I love the parts where you get carried away in the little boy's dreams. That surreal view shows us the differences in thinking between an adult and a child. The music is what you can expect from a Turkish film. You either like it or you don't. But it's never overwhelming. I really recommend this movie to everyone. And no, I am not Turkish!"

A young socialist newspaper writer (Fikret Kuskan) loses his wife on birth of his only son on the very first day of the military action, because he can not find any help for delivery of the child. After 6 years past, the father was desperate to find any jobs on the papers, which are now supporters of the new order, and decides to return his father (\u00c7etin Tekindor)'s home in a small village near Izmir: A house that he has left years ago fighting his father's wills to make him a person that his father would like him to be.\n\nI can not even summarize the rest of the movie, since one should see the movie himself/herself to understand the encounters of two strangers, father and son. One should notice the mother (Humeyra)'s role on the relationship (or non-relationship) of these two different men, and the grandson (Ege Tanman).\n\nIf you have a Mediterrenean blood, Greek, Italian, whatever, you will find many things in this movie. You don't have to be Turk to understand the emotional rivers in this movie. It really touches hearts of the Turkish people."

Hospitality, love, grief, laughs... Everything is included in this movie. An emotional breakthrough. The movie also points on the elderly reality -now an impossibility- the torture, made by the cops.\n\nBetter to be watched by fathers and sons. Also, crying may occur, don't worry; too many people who watched the movie had the same."

The actors do such an amazing job that you will sympathize with them and might indulge in some crying even if you are a male.\n\nEven if you don't cry this movie will touch you and will make you think about your own life.\n\nMovies that are able to and make you REFLECT and THINK about yourself, for my taste, are part of the best movies of all time because their messages are delivered in a way so that you will never forget them.\n\nGo see this movie and vote because this is not only the best Turkish movie ever, but one of the best movies ever made."

The acting is definitely remarkable with less experienced characters (including the little kids) putting on a display to remember when aiding patriots of Turkish movie industry.

No special effects, no superhuman strengths no fantastic landscapes.. Just human and the ordinary feelings. I felt some rush to call my mom and dad just after the movie to be sure that they are OK and to make them know once again that I really care about them. This movie makes you think deeper on values that make us human and also etches itself irreversibly to your memory by touching the deepest possible regions of your soul.. Highly recommended; a must-see! Do not forget your tissue papers because you probably will not be able to keep your tears from flowing...\n\nThanks Cagan Irmak, and continue to blow our minds away.."

While acting wasn't spot on in a couple of places, mostly everybody has done a very good job and though it may appear that the actors are overacting you have to keep in mind that different cultures have different norms and different ways of expressing emotions.\n\n\"My Father and My Son\" is not groundbreaking, but It is both touching and humorous without falling in too many clich\u00e9s.

It is a very touchy story..\n\nHowever, it is not that what makes this film good one.. You don't need to know all Turkish history to feel the movie.. You don't need to be Turkish either.. This is emotion.. This is life.. The Mediterrenean way of life.. I guess in a Mediterrenean perspective the movie would appeal to many. I myself watched a lot of Italian movies with similar scenario. The life from a 7-8 yo kid's eyes gather things in a three-generational dimension.... There are many scenes that are going to be remembered long.. The first encountering of the kid and grandfather is really touchy.. The blood is thicker than water.. This is what so called about a FAMILY..\n\nBy the way\u0085 for the international audience.. Deniz is name of Turkey's one of the most famous leftish youth leaders in 70:s with a great charismatic personality. So, that's why the name of the kid is not at all a coincidence.."

I went to back again to my childhood when I was watching the movie. It reflects the life style of those places in a very good manner and reality. No detail was skipped. Also the director mixed the drama and joy in the movie very well so that you can laugh suddenly when you pity for something you see in the movie. This was, I think, a great directing success for the new generation director, \u00c7agan Irmak. So, this a \"must to see\" film I think, especially for the Turkish viewers (It includes so much domestic features).

Lots of people have already commented that this is a good film so I don't need to add to that, but I did have some problems with it.\n\nThe film is very Turkish, while that is not a bad thing I do think it appeal to audiences from other countries is limited. That nearly all the comments here about the film are from Turkish people shows that it appeals mainly to Turks.\n\nThe theme of the film is: blood is thicker than water. The moral of the story is: even if your father treats you like rubbish you should still respect and love him. The father/grandfather is unpleasant and self-centered. If my father was like this man I would never trust him with my son. But this is why Turks will understand this film better than some other people. This is not about being 'warm blooded' (as Turks like to believe they are), it is about being unable to survive without a family support system (even if that system is dysfunctional).\n\nTowards the end of the film the old man seems to have a turn around of character; but we have to assume that this is only temporary, and that he will later go back to be a horrible old man, because it is noticeable that no one likes him. And they have good reason not to like him.\n\nThe film is not really political, it dodges the political issues. The military coup is only used as a melodramatic backdrop. If fact the film also dodges the issues about family, about why we treat people they way we do and instead uses sentimental melodrama to pull on our heart-strings.\n\nI do not believe this can be the best film made in Turkey (as many people have written)."

The role of the strong mother (H\u00fcmeyra) who is trying to do her best to retain the relation between her husband and her son into its normal course and how she is keen to get her family back together was brilliant that she make you cry and laugh in the same time.

The oldest brother (\u00c7etin Tekindor) his natural simplicity which he conducted in his role of a loving older brother whose ill youngest brother was being fed by his own hands while he is waiting for his destiny at the hospital.

In fact this is the best movie of Turks.\n\nStory, Acting, Music etc. everything was perfect.\n\nIt is about 3 generation. Father, Son n Grandpa. Most of the theatre cried many times and in the same scene we suddenly start smile sometimes they were more than smile.\n\nThis is my reaction in a scene :) => :( => :(( => :('' => :)I would like to celebrate Cagan Irmak and all the actors even children\n\nTurkish Movies are commonly made for money but this is not one of them but this will be the most movie ever watched in Turkey this year. I think this is also better than Gonul Yaras\u0131 which is a nominie for Oscar nominies."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's one of those films which really affect you deep. The movie somehow makes ordinary places, ordinary people and ordinary events become interesting. I think it's due to the way Cagan Irmak (writer and director) cleverly and carefully blends everything. The movie is definitely not like a Hollywood production, maybe more like a European film. The film has many enjoyable moments but it's mainly emotional. The actings are magnificent, the story is heart-breaking and the places are so real. All performances were remarkable, but I should say I was over impressed by Cetin Tekindor's (Huseyin Aga) acting. While the bitter truths about life and family relations are portrayed perfectly, the movie also reflects life from the innocent eyes of a child. Personally, the local rural village life took me back to my some good memories. There is no need to tell what happens in the film as enough is said in the plot summary. More would only spoil it. But, it should be noted that even though the plot may sound political, the film is actually not.\n\nThe movie came out without much advertising, but in short time became very popular - won many awards in Turkey and some in Europe. Not much to say... brilliant work. If you haven't seen it, I advise you watch it whenever possible. If you don't feel like crying in this movie, you will feel sorry for yourself."

This one is definitely in my top 10 best movies ever made.\n\nThe drama and comedy genre is so perfectly mixed that many times one will get the feeling of laughing and crying all at once.\n\nIf you have not watched this movie yet, get it. No matter what you will like it. Actors do a very good job and the director's is one which is not even one to mention, just EXCELLENT.\n\nThis movie will relate to everyone and will give you an emotional vibe.\n\nEnjoy"

His first short-cut film was also quite remarkable called bana old and wise i cal. When all of these considered, i went to babam ve oglum with high expectations yet i could not find something just above the average.

        "review_detailed_main": "A huge hit on its first release in 2005, BABAM VE O\u011eLUM (MY FATHER AND MY SON) is an unabashed melodrama with the emphasis on excess.\n\nThe story is a straightforward one: Sad\u0131k (Fikret Ku\u015fkan) has to deliver his first child alone, when there is no one to take his wife Aysun (Tuba B\u00fcy\u00fck\u00fcst\u00fcn) to the hospital. The wife dies, leaving Sad\u0131k a single parent on the first day of the military coup taking place in the Republic of Turkey on 12 September 1980.\n\nTime passes: Sad\u0131k is imprisoned and tortured for his political views; but on his release, he leaves \u0130stanbul with his son Deniz (Ege Tanman) to return to the family home near \u0130zmir. He receives a frosty welcome from his father H\u00fcseyin (\u00c7etin Tekindor) who has never forgiven Sad\u0131k for quitting his studies in agriculture in \u0130stanbul and turning to politics instead. The rest of the movie focuses on the way familial relationships change, as well as how people cope with an unexpected tragedy.\n\nDirector \u00c7a\u011fan Irmak looks at the oppressive influence of the past on the present; not only does it affect relationships between Sad\u0131k and H\u00fcseyin, but it significantly dictated Sad\u0131k's love-life too. Returning to his home-town, Sad\u0131k is at once attracted and repelled by its familiarity; those who have never left - even for a short time - remain blinkered in their world-views. On the other hand BABAM VE O\u011eLUM shows how families stick together in times of crisis, and can resolve their own problems so long as they are prepared to acknowledge them in the first place.\n\nThe narrative contrasts Sad\u0131k's story with Deniz's imaginative fantasies, in which the little boy positions himself as the hero. In the first part of the film they can be read as a retreat from reality, as Deniz tries to cope with the trauma of moving to a new town and coping with a new life. By the end, however, he has discovered that such fantasies might change, once he grows up. They will remain fantasies, but they will fulfill a different function in his life.\n\nThe film is full of major scenes of confrontation and reconciliation, with Irmak's camera-work designed to achieve maximum dramatic effect through the use of close-ups, panning shots, dissolves, and two- shots, complemented by a florid musical score (by Evanthia Reboutsika). Although the narrative celebrates excess - of emotion, of feeling and of reconciliation - it does not seem in any way forced. In fact, it is as convincing and emotion-provoking as the best Ye\u015fil\u00e7am melodramas of the past. Clearly Irmak planned BABAM VE O\u011eLUM as an homage to the genre, and he accomplishes his task with \u00e9lan. Definitely worth more than one viewing."

In Turkey film awarded so many prizes in film festivals as best film, best actor, best actress, best supporting role ...etc. I think this film is really a milestone of a Turkish Film Industry. One of the best film ever seen without a doubt. I recommend everybody to watch."

Although it may not affect a foreigner in the same way, for people who lived the era described in the film are moved. The film focus on the coup d'etat of 1980, and how it ruined the lives of idealist people, especially leftist. However, there is more than that... The drama of the small family is based on a contradiction between the traditions of the Turkish rural families and the thoughts of the youngsters of these families. This contradiction is in the minds of these young people as much as it is in their relationship with their parents. Thus, the film both judges and defends the Turkish traditional family structure, first by showing how cruel they can be when a family member is against the \"tradition\", and secondly by showing how compassionate they are when the same member of the family is in trouble. Consequently, the film may not mean much for foreigners but I should mention the fact that I have cried first time watching a movie in my 28 year long life!"

Even then the music could sometimes be overbearing but it fitted more since we got to know the characters and things had more weight for us. Overall it was well shot, the acting was good. I expected this movie to be more political but it was mostly family drama about relationship between father and son. Although some things were exaggerated for the sake of emotional impact, the movie still held together without being a typical spanish or turkish soap opera, but it still has elements of them none the less. Although it pulled my emotions, I cant rate it very high overall. It gets 10/10 for emotional manipulation but it falls on other parts. Its a 7/10 for me."

He has been estranged from his conservative father since leaving for school in Istanbul. Intending to leave Deniz with his parents, his mother forces him to stay. The father and son struggle to come to terms in their relationship.\n\nThis is digging into a deep family rift and finds a compelling movie. I would prefer Sadik to look more sickly when he arrives back at the village. It meanders as the plot lacks an obvious ticking clock. That's why Sadik's sickness should be played up to make his end more inevitable. It culminates with one oddly riveting emotional eruption by the father. It is breath-taking in its rawness. It helps that these actors are unknown to me which creates a realism despite the surreal emotional eruption."

In my opinion \u00c7agan Irmak is the best director in T\u00fcrkiye and he will be one of the well-known directors in the World. Also the cast of this movie performed well. Jokes and melancholic element are perfect balanced. On the other hand; your psychology can be underover because you can cry and laugh at the same time.I want to congratulate all these people who helped to film this movie. Some good things can be in T\u00fcrkiye. You must see this movie.\n\nEDIT: Turkish voting madness crossed the line.. This film's avarege is now 9.0. I think it will be over it.. It's nice for Turkish Films but this film can't be better than GOD FATHER.. Think two times giving 10 for this film."

It was so effective that most of the spectators including me watching the film in the cinema could not help weeping. I think Sadik's son will be a great actor in the future. Because his performance at he age of 7 was remarkable.\n\nFikret Kuskan's performance also meets our expectations. The beginning of the film I think conflicts with the quality of the whole film, the only performance that did not fit the situation was the performance of Sadik's wife. She was so artificial, her appearance of pregnant woman was not convincing at all. Fortunately, her role was short. Overall, it was the best Turkish film I have ever seen."

I couldn't find the opportunity to watch it on the silver-screen, but the recently published DVD is also awesome with all aspects.\n\nCagan Irmak, with his movie \"Mustafa Hakkinda Hersey\" already put forward his magic in Turkish cinema industry, but \"Babam ve Oglum\" takes you to some place else, where you cannot stop the tears in your eyes. He is a genius in many ways, from the scenario to the realization...\n\nAll the cast, without any exemption are totally fit and every little detail, every gesture is almost precisely calculated... The little boy ( Ege Tanman )is a marvel, and I hope he's gonna stay that way all through his career.\n\n\u00c7etin Tekindor ( the granddad ), is a theatre based actor and performs one of his best. Fikret Kushan ( the dad ) is already a Cagan Irmak favorite and is just perfect with no exaggeration. Humeyra ( the grandmom ) also performs one of her best in her career and let's you put a smile on your face in all those dramatic occurrences.\n\nI hope this movie will find a way to exhibit itself worldwide and warm up many hearts who need to examine the fragility of a father-son relationship.\n\nBravo Cagan Irmak !!! Thanks Avsar Film...\n\nPS. For anyone who reads this critic: if you have no way to watch the movie, insist on having the DVD, that'll be a classic in no time."

Both laughter and tears exist and are very deeply knitted in almost every scene, resembling real life: you can find something of yourself in every character of the movie, you can watch your childhood within the eyes of Denis and realize that you have lived similar pains, sorrows and joys.

I love those moments when the film is over and i am sobbing & sniffing. I love it writing a film review with teary eyes and wrenched heart. After seeing more than Ten Top class Family dramas in Hollywood, Bollywood and Indian Cinema finally i found something which i can call 'The Best Family Drama Ever'. Family emotions were never so new and never so touching before. I know Emotional Family Drama is nothing new, it's the same old story but i don't know how this film managed to pull off the same old stuff with such a new and innovative way? My Father And My Son is story of Sadik who left his father and Mother years ago and now is blessed by a Child. He returns to his Father and Mother's house so that his Son can have a Home. See there is nothing new or outstanding in the plot but the storytelling is New and Outstanding. The way film is narrated by a Child who is living Real Life and Fantasy together, the way things are mixed up, the way memories from old days are used, the way Father and Son relationship is explored, everything is so Emotional and for a change so Clever. I don't remember watching such an intelligent narrative in this genre. All actors make this one look like a real family, they create thier place in your heart because every character is different in nature and you are forced to love them all. Background Music is so beautiful and mesmerizing, i could feel it in all those emotional moments. Direction is Top Notch. A rare case when i don't have any complaints to make. My Father and My Son is a story for everyone who love thier kids, fathers and thier family and that's why it is Universal subject. It would be shameful for you if you miss this MASTERPIECE..\n\nRATING - 9/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest"

The players in the movie are so flawless and perfect on their job; like Cetin Tekindor as a famous actor (I consider him as Antony Hopkins of Turkey) and the great actress H\u00fcmeyra are in the leading roles. Besides the players, the creative director Cagan Irmak is one of the greatest young directors in Turkey. A few cheer-up-scenes are not missing even though the movie affects the people with the very dramatic ambiance. This is a really must-see movie for the Turkish people and for foreigns, do not ever miss it if you find this movie somehow. It may be seen as i'm exaggerating the whole thing but i really think that this movie is a turning point in the Turkish Movie History."

This is perhaps a double-edged sword, because although it has its appeal, the doses of suffering, pain and anguish exceed realistic parameters, becoming highly exaggerated theatrical acts. Some characters even fall into caricature, further detracting from the film's credibility.\n\nThe overall performances are good. The photography and direction are very well developed, taking the shots into creative territories. The soundtrack becomes repetitive, being one of the weak links in the technical aspects of the film.\n\nIn general, this is a product that is aimed at an audience that enjoys tragedies and family dramas.

It was not, as hyped, \"One of the best movies ever.\" Instead, it was a poorly done, trite melodrama that I forced myself, and I mean FORCED myself to watch for about 35 minutes. I'll admit, one does take a chance when he buys based upon the recommendations of other IMDb users, but sometimes the risk is worth the reward. I suspect that the movie was \"ramped\" up by users in order to increase its appeal, and it certainly caught my interest due to its seemingly high ratings. But let's not be fooled. The $30 I spent for this title, yes $30!, was a complete waste of money. Usually I will try to resell those purchases I make on Amazon and Ebay that don't meet my expectations, but in this case the movie was so poor that I threw it into the trash, not desiring to foist the same foolish film on others. My warning: stay away from this movie at all costs, even if it is offered to you for free!"

Everyone in this movie is so talented.The music is(composed by Evanthia Reboutsika ) minimal and wonderful.\n\nI wish the movie will be released in the other countries.Highly recommended.

        "review_detailed_main": "Babam ve Oglum, or My Father and My Son, takes place at the start and in the aftermath of the 1980 Turkish coup, where the existing government was overthrown and a military junta took power. This took place on September 12th, and on that same night a left-wing journalist, Sadik (Fikret Kuskan), lost his wife in childbirth. We jump some years into the future as Sadik returns back to his childhood home in the countryside with his son Deniz (Ege Tanman).\n\nWhat I appreciate the most about this movie is how layered it is. How it tells so many stories at once. First of all, it's a great story about returning back home after having left it years ago. I too grew up in the countryside, and this movie tells it just like it is. About how it feels so alien, like the place has been frozen in time, but at the same time there's immediacy to it, certain purity even. It feels like home in a way city never can.\n\nIt's also a story about three different generations trying to build and rebuild bridges. About grandparents finding a connection with a grandson they've never met. About a son trying to reason with his father, both Deniz with Sadik and Sadik with H\u00fcseyin (\u00c7etin Tekindor), Deniz's grandfather. And as a sidenote, can I just state how much I loved the character of Salim (Yetkin Dikinciler), Sadik's brother, who stayed when he left. What a kindhearted, honest and utterly likable character.\n\nAnd yes, it's also a story about a certain period in Turkish history. But that stuff is not at the foreground. It plays a part in the narrative, but more as a source of causality. It's the reason why things happen, but not the focus. And I think that was the right call to make, in order for these other stories to have enough room to grow and shine.\n\nThis movie isn't widely known as of writing this review. And that's a shame. It has the depth, the expertise and the purity of message to be a true classic. I hope more people find it in years to come, because it surely deserved to be watched and appreciated."

Big thanks to him for this masterpiece. There are not many directors who could portray this type of intense realism into movies.\n\nStanding ovation for the cinematography! There are many subtle details which can only be understood by multiple watching. Special thanks to Evanthia Reboutsika for her outstanding music composition for this movie. Her music can stir all kinds of emotions.\n\nThe movie was a good example of character development. Especially pleased with the acting of the kid (Ege Tanman). He was just mind blowing. Hussain Aga sometime looked like Turkish version of Vito Corleone. At the time when Hussain said '.... if I stood like this, Nuran if I stopped Sadik, if I hugged him like this......' - this was probably one of the best scene in the history of movies.\n\nThere is no happy ending for everything in life. Like Deniz, it's important to accept reality - no matter how hard. It's necessary to move on. Some movies can portray this truth artistically. That's how they become milestone movies. This is one of the best Turkish movie I've ever seen.\n\nDon't just see, experience it."

People separate each other with external factors and it takes time to bandage wounds and to forget about what were lived. 12th of September was such kind of phenomenon. Cagan Irmak did fine work on making movie about this fact.\n\nUsing local accents, authentic music in background, accomplishment of actors and actress are the main factors for being liked. The characters are very familiar to us and they are certainly assimilated from the life itself.\n\nDramatic wave walk with a swaying movement along the movie.\n\nOne of the last scene in which Sadik come out of camera and make a speech to this son should have been eliminated. This scene does not contribute to the story. If the marginal contribution of scenes is zero, cut them and make the movie simpler. This is the golden rule of film-making.\n\nI am pleased that Babam ve Oglum is a worldwide movie and we are in the right way to find a good position in this art world."

The film talks about a close history of a country, by perfectly harmonizing the historical and political history with a totally personal and emotional relationship between sons and fathers. In Turkey, the film made such a great success that for months, it was really hard to find any tickets before reservation. Cagan Irmak is a great director who manages to make the audience feel the warmth of relationships and life, by creating natural scenes of village and city life, affairs between people and struggles of human with himself or outside."

Some movies are able to pull this off, but this one never seems to provide quite enough background or personality behind the characters to make me feel emotionally attached to any of them.\n\nThe acting also played a role in my failure to connect. Many scenes were acted convincingly or adequately, but others seemed either unrealistic or overacted. In my opinion, the only consistent actor played the brother Salim, who was quite funny in several scenes (even if one of those scenes abruptly killed an emotional scene).\n\nA final comment is that the composer and director quite obviously did not cooperate for this film. Whenever background music is playing, the end transition never failed to be jarring. The music would stop or change in such a way that never failed to break any immersion I had in the film. It was very apparent that the director, composer, editor, etc. did not have any idea how to make a musical transition."

Both groups went as far as to do bombing (or they say it was the work of the Western ideologies in play along with the secret state in Turkey). Then the Army staged a coup on September the 12 in 1980 and made thousands of arrests and significant amount of torture went on in the prisons... They even hanged 50 people that were found guilty(!) as they tortured hundreds of people (at least 171, proved) to death... And to this day the good people of Turkey suffers the consequences... Now, if we say that this movie tells one of the many stories of that era, it is absolutely true as \"the father\" had seen the torture and mistreat in the prison for what he had done nothing wrong... His heartbreaking story also reveals so many levels of the culture of Turkey and the bigheartedness of its people... Last but not least, if you ever claim that you have seen \"drama\", and your eyes won't just stop \"shedding tears\"; I kindly dare you watch this piece of art!.. I say it is gut-wrenching as well as mesmerising!.. So, no point in denying that the top 250 it belongs to!.."

It speaks to the universal struggles of family life-the misunderstandings, the unconditional support, and the moments of pure joy-that are familiar to everyone, regardless of where they come from. This powerful message resonates deeply, reminding viewers of the shared bonds that unite us all in our experiences of love, loss, and belonging.\n\nThe film is not just a visual spectacle but an emotional journey, weaving together layers of storytelling that evoke both thought and feeling. Its ability to balance moments of subtle beauty with raw, heartfelt emotion makes it a unique viewing experience. In every scene, the film seamlessly blends visual artistry with a deeply human narrative, creating a work of art that is both moving and visually stunning.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a film that transcends entertainment, offering a rich and meaningful reflection on the human condition.

It is a must-watch for anyone who values family, storytelling, and the shared experiences that make us all human. This film is not just a story-it's an experience that will stay with you long after you leave the theater."

        "review_detailed_main": "On an individual basis, I like this movie because it includes everything about the family relationship as dram, sadness, humorous, compassion, hatred which are actually explain family relationship. Besides, movie starts from 1980 Turkish coup so we can learn Turkish history as well as we can understand difficult situation on that time in Turkey. Also, we can enter the child's world who is a motherless. I do not know someone who did not cry in this movie. I remember my grandpa and my father when I watch this movie, I remember my childhood with amazing soundtracks. Both \"my father\" and \"we will meet again\" songs are so emotional and mopey and these songs help me to trip down memory lane because all childhood memories are actually mopey for me."

It is a beautiful depiction of simple rural life in Israel following a contrast in city life that is mixed with turmoil and conflict. It covers three generations of a family coming together.\n\nThe movie depicts how you can never forget your roots or stay away from it and whatever happens life comes full circle. You can each take your own meaning out of the movie, the father may regret his actions as his heart is filled with his childhood memories or it may just be a recollection of his simple life. The sons imagination runs wild and is amazing to behold while the grandfathers stubbornness stays grounded in reality.\n\nIt is a nice family drama and the movie captures all of it beautifully till the end."
