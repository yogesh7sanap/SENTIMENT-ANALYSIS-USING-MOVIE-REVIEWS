        "review_detailed_main": "This movie will not disappoint you, thats for sure. It is a fun filled hilarious film for the entire family. No double meaning or sex comedy. Enjoyable for kids and elders. It is not as entertaining like Hera Pheri, but certainly 100 times better than recent disasters like \"Do knot disturb\". The cast of the movie was pretty good. Sanjay Dutt, Fardeen Khan and Ajay Devgan did a good job. It starts to make you laugh almost from the beginning and then keeps you laughing till the end. The theater hall was roaring with laughter at times, and everyone had a smile on their face throughout. Other comedians apart from the trio were: Asrani: As funny as ever. He still manages to deliver the comedy with the same energy as before. I really admire him for that. Johnny Lever: Pretty good comedy Ashwini Kalsekar: Fails to get a grip on South Indian accent, so was disappointing. Sanjay Mishra, Atul Parchure & Vijay Patkar: These people don't need to do any comedy, their looks are funny enough.\n\nThe jokes in the movie were fresh, unheard and hilarious. There were some breathtaking car racing stunts in the beginning for the action freaks. Most of the comedy credit goes to Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan duet in the movie. Bipasha Basu did her part well. All in all a very hilarious movie. Watch it with your family, you will certainly enjoy it. P.S: David Dhawan should certainly watch this movie and learn how to make comedy movies for today's audience."

        "review_title": "The first enjoyable comedy of 2009.",
        "review_detailed_main": "It's October 2009 and we still haven't got any worth watching comedy to remember. But the good news is that this dearth of quality fun capers has finally come to an end with \"All The Best\", a well made potent fun movie, packed with highly enjoyable hilarious moments for the needy viewers. Interestingly, though Rohit Shetty's comedy may be less exciting in its star presence as compared to the other biggies released on the same Friday, but in reality it seems to be the best of the lot presented before us in this festive mood.\n\nMoving around the same lines of \"Golmaal\" (2006) and Inspired by the play \"Right Bed Wrong Husband\", the story has the same old elements of mistaken identities, which in turn gives rise to some amusing funny moments to enjoy. The story mainly revolves around the character of Sanjay Dutt, who is a big business tycoon just visiting his younger brother, Fardeen Khan for a few hours. Mistaking Ajay Devgan's girl (Bipasha) as Fardeen's wife, the confusions start cropping up which even get worse when Sanjays's few hours stay gets converted into days due to the flight cancellation.\n\nThough, the movie starts with the same routine stuff of introducing the characters and their love connections along with the two unwanted songs right in the beginning. But after the first 15 minutes it straight away comes back to the job of making you laugh and also manages to complete its job quite successfully. The hilarious interaction between various characters entangled in the identity trap, generates enough laughter to give you a good time in the theater.\n\nWith the entertaining comic timing between Sanjay Dutt & Ajay Devgan, the film picks up fast and gets good support from the side tracks of Johny Lever & Sanjay Mishra. In fact Johny Lever returns with his impeccable mannerisms posing as a Don who can't speak. He mimics Prem Nath's act of Karz in a very engaging manner and just excels in the climax when he gets his voice back accidentally. Sanjay Mishra as the rich man from the slums is also at his best, especially in his interaction scenes with Sanjay Dutt. Along with the superb performances of Ajay & Sanjay, Fardeen Khan as usual, just provides the required support to both. Bipasha also tries well to match up the comedy acts of others and looks after the glamour quotient of the movie too. But Mughda Godse is hardly there to prove herself.\n\nPritam's not so great musical score sounds fine while watching the movie, but for a change, it doesn't compel you to buy the Soundtrack CD after the screening. Moreover a few songs could have been easily edited out to make it a crispier watch. Cinematography is perfect as required by a comedy flick, but the dialogue writing excels with some superb one liners and funny jokes.\n\nAll the performers get brilliant support from their writers, especially in the scenes where Sanjay Dutt enters the house for the first time and in the climax, when all the characters are together on the screen. As a surprise, a highly emotional sequence also impresses you in this comedy when Bipasha is declared pregnant by the doctor. Collectively, all the three, Ajay Devgan, Sanjay Dutt and Johny Lever are in their full form after a long time, getting adequate support from the rest of the cast.\n\nIn short, the multiple character entangle once again proves lucky for the director Rohit Shetty and he surely comes up with the first quality comedy of 2009. Go for it to have a good festive weekend with the family."

        "review_detailed_main": "Being a big fan of Rohit Shetty's previous work i.e. Golmaal, Golmaal Returns & Sunday, i was so excited about this release that I forced my friends to catch the morning show. The film like the Golmaal/Returns starts with a song which wasn't as good in comparison. The starts on a slow track and it is clear with the Maid's fake accent and few other scenes that they are trying to force the audience to laugh. Not much happening for sometime and when you have already concluded that this is a big mistake booom enters Sanjay Dutt. The fun actually starts from there as we the audience now feel like laughing. The biggest drawback of this movie I feel is that it is very clean, and now a days when everything has been tried in comedy, it is very difficult to make a comedy movie without double meaning dialogues. If you refer back to Golmaal/Returns & Sunday, you will find many adult jokes hidden. As all the best is family movie, it lacks that kind of humor. Overall i would say the movie is decent, horrible acting by Fardeen Khan, Bipasha is OK, Ajay Devegan has given much better performances and Sanjay Dutt is the best."

        "review_detailed_main": "Directed by Rohit Shetty, the man behind the two recent Golmaal films \u2013 the first hilarious, the second not so \u2013 All The Best stars Fardeen Khan and Ajay Devgan as buddies Veer and Prem, who owe an awful lot of money to a local don, but have no means to raise it. Renting out Veer's sprawling Goa bungalow seems to be their only choice, but when Dharam, his burly step-brother played by Sanjay Dutt, shows up unannounced, Veer and Prem find themselves trapped in a mess of their own making.To increase his monthly pocket money, Veer has been lying to Dharam that he's married to his girlfriend Vidya, but Dharam has never met his sister-in-law. When Dharam mistakes Prem's wife Jhanvi (played by Bipasha Basu) for Vidya, no one bothers to correct him. So the real Vidya (played by Mughda Ghodse) must pretend to be Prem's girlfriend Jhanvi. Confused? Wait there's more. There's also the issue of the don's loan, and the new tenant wanting to move into the bungalow, but Veer and Prem are trying hard to hide those dirty little secrets from Dharam. An ensemble piece, apparently based on a popular play, All The Best wanders aimlessly for its first 15-odd minutes, only to come into its own with the arrival of Dutt's character Dharam, whose scenes with Devgan's Prem are easily the film's funniest. The set-up also includes a bunch of madcap characters including a mute gangster who communicates by rattling a spoon inside a glass, a Malyalee housemaid with a deep voice, a crackpot tenant who can't wait to move into his new house, and a tempo-driver who wants to unload the furniture in his vehicle so he can attend to his pregnant wife. The humour in this film isn't exactly smart, but it helps that the makers give you little time to dwell on that fact. The jokes come flying at you from all directions, and it's hard not to break into laughs when a big guy like Sanjay Dutt participates in the silliness. Shorter in length \u2013 its songs sacrificed, its action scenes trimmed \u2013 All The Best might have been a great Diwali treat. As it currently stands, it's a delicious one-time watch"

A young man, who is in love and wants to marry his girlfriend, is a singer by profession but has problems related to money and his best friend, who is married, tries to help him by giving him some ideas and implementing them.\n\nStarring Sanjay Dutt, Bipasha Basu, Ajay Devgan, Fardeen Khan, Ashwini Khalsekar, Asrani, Johnny Lever and Mukesh Tiwari. Directed by Rohit Shetty, Produced by Ajay Devgan and the music score is by Pritam Chakraborthy.\n\n\"Munnabhai\" Sanjay Dutt and Mukesh Tiwari along with Johnny Lever, steal this show from all the others and all three of them are worth watching as they have some good scenes. Fardeen Khan was good but he could have done a bit better as he is capable of doing comedy. Action man, Ajay Devgan has improved in comedy, while Bipasha Basu and all the others are OK. Director, Rohit Shetty has made sure that there is laughter almost on a non stop basis as one comic scene follows another.\n\nWhat makes this film a bit interesting is that the actors speak a dialect of an African language \u2013 Swahili, which is from the East African region of the African continent and this is used rather nicely in a semiotic manner by Rohit Shetty, who has mixed this in with humour.\n\nIf you are out to have a good laugh then this is a film that is worth watching."

Direction is very good from Rohit Shetty, he had done Superb work after Golmaal and Sunday. Performance wise, no doubt Ajay devgan is the show stealer, Fardeen improves a lot, Bips and Mughda was hardly dere, But Sanju Baba does an awesome job, though I am not a fan of his movies, he is at his best in this movie, Another person who impress a lot in small role is Sanjay Mishra. I will rate 8/10, as these is a situational neat and clean comedy, without any double meaning words, and its a complete fun journey which you can enjoy with your whole Family\n\nALL THE BEST AJAY!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Its silliness will get to you and make you laugh. The plot is nonsensical, implausible. Half the jokes will not appeal to you. But the other half will, so you're assured a fairly decent two hours spent, watching the antics of Ajay, Fardeen and Sanjay sparking off each other, while watching the widely assorted supporting cast of Bips, Mugdha (who looked slightly ill at ease), Asrani, Johnny Lever, Atul Parchure and Sanjay Mishra, prance, dance and get beaten The story is irrelevant so I wont get into it. Lets just say it involves a rich brother, mistaken identities and eccentric villains, tenants, music bands and a car race. The film is actually just a string of assorted gags, jokes and situations. Sample : What is a PhD : Phata Hua Dhol. MBA : Maha Bekaar Aadmi. When someone serving tea asks, 'kitne chamach ?', pat comes the reply, 'bhai, chamach to ek hi lekin cheeni do dena..'\u0085 The male trio here, Ajay, Fardeen and Sanjay are the ones who really carry the movie on their shoulders, reducing all others to necessary extra's. Ajay's laconic nature and deadpan expression suits him well as does the Sanjay's more expressive nature. The antipathy between the two is nicely built up and provides for several of the funnier moments. Fardeen does a good job in his role but is second fiddle to the two seniors.\n\nThere are plenty of slapstick moments \u2013 you get the 'dog chasing a guy in boxers', the 'man on man moment' etc but thankfully the bulk of the film relies more on the silly, goofy moments and snappy one liners.\n\nDecent, worth a watch and you're assured a few laughs\u0085you may try to resist, but the silliness does overcome all stiffness and eventually you join the ride\u0085All the Best"

The main reason for this movie become a very good entertainer is because of only Ajay Devgan(as prem chopra) and Sanjay Dutt(as Dharam). The comedy is all on the right places with nice logic and no vulgarity.\n\nThe story revolves around two friends one who is rich (fardeen khan as veer) wasting his pocket money(sent by his step brother Dharam) in unnecessary things. Since he wants to double his pocket money he lies to his brother as he got married. Every thing goes into the confusion when Veer's brother comes to his home(which is in GOA) to meet the newly wed couple when Veer gave his home for rent.All the trouble comes and goes with some rib tickling comedy between Ajay Devgan and Sanjay Dutt is really awesome. Until the most disgusting climax I have ever seen showing some African's(where actually Dutt does his business with the king)come to kill him and Sanjay Dutt revealing his love for the king's sister.\n\nThe movie is very nice with awesome jokes in some parts but the climax made me irritate so 7/10..............\n\nDon't miss it.............Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "There is one thing conspicuously invisible in 'All The Best' \u0085. The Director - Rohit Shetty. Not that he has any noteworthy cinema riding on his back with forgettable works such as Golmaal, Golmaal returns (??!!), Zameen and Sunday but this time around, it's as though the actors Ajay Devgan, Fardeen Khan, Sanjay Dutt, Sanjay Mishra, Johnny Lever and the femme fatales were left on their own with a half page story to work with. Screenplay, script, editing etc are left to the spot boys while the handful of funny dialogues must be conjured up by the actors themselves. Thus, all we get in terms of entertainment are a few funny scenes and dialogues and the rest of the movie being a stale brew of hamming, over-the-top action, loud comedy and silly amateurish scenes that suit a 4th grade school play than a movie with so many actors.\n\nAll the best is what one could watch on a holiday afternoon when there's nothing better to watch on television. You will kill time instead of passing through it\u0085.. some brain cells as well. Fardeen Khan is wasted in a role where he appears to be nothing more than helpless, Ajay Devgan has done better even in Hindustan Ki Kasam with his performance while his aspirations of being a producer are rightly picked on by Dutt's humorous take on it in the movie. Even Johnny Lever had one of his worst roles in the movie where he plays a mute gangster whereas Sanjay Mishra's character does nothing but repeat the same dialogues over and over to the point of irritation. Bipasha does what best she can do with the piecemeal role that she has while that Mugdha Godse may not be seen on the big screen again after this stint. Sanjay Dutt is the only actor who entertains in the movie. All the jokes, quirky dialogues and funny scenes belong to him and he renders them flawlessly.\n\nSurprisingly, in all the mess, 2 songs truly stand out by Pritam \u2013 'Haan Main Jitni Martaba' & 'Kyon'. KK & Pritam have given countless hits and this time too, they excel with their combined skills with a rocking track in 'Martaba' while Clinton Cerejo gives his best so far in 'Kyon'. The conclusion is that Sanjay Dutt is the only factor one can sit through the movie that has some bit of humour in dialogues and scenes associated with his character. The rest of the movie is simply forgettable and at the same time memorable for the complete lack of direction in its plot, editing, screenplay, meaning, purpose and authenticity. For a Diwali release, such negligence should be unforgivable. One must subject Rohit Shetty to watch Golmaal & Golmaal Returns \u0085\u0085\u0085back-to-back!!"

And hats off to Rohit Shetty for coming up with this absolutely fun and hilarious movie. I was burst into laughters all the time. Great job. This movie will surely give Priyadarshan a run for his money. My rating : 9/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Rohit Shetty is THE David Dhawan of Bollywood today. Dhawan ruled throughout the 90's with comedies, and the 2000's belong to Shetty when it comes to comedies. 'Golmaal' was hilarious, while the sequel was plain average. 'All The Best' is Shetty's finest work after 'Golmaal'. It's silly, but funny and a fair entertainer nonetheless.\n\nLogic is not the question here, Entertainment is. I laughed my ass off at times, while sometimes I thought the humor went stale and plain bad. Shetty's direction is neat, handling the funniest of sequences with ease and style.\n\nSanjay Dutt may be in a supporting role in 'All The Best', but he eats everyone up in here. He's excellent and his portions are the Highlight of this film, loved him. Ajay Devgn tries hard to make you laugh, he's okay. Fardeen Khan is good. Sanjay Mishra & Johny Lever are fantastic. Mishra's just chill n Lever's silence keep the proceedings alive. Bipasha looks a million bucks, which is a routine thing for the babe. Her performance is really good. Mugdha is wasted. Asrani is effective.\n\nOn the whole 'All The Best' is a must see for those who thrust for a strictly time-pass fare."

It was even better for me since I was stressed out this week :) This is definitely better than Golmaal Returns, this movie just keeps getting better as it progresses. Some punch lines are too good, and Johnny lever returns too! Like all good comedy movies, this works because the movie gives a decent share of funny lines to almost all characters. I found the character played by Sanjay Mishra funniest (the guy who used to play Shukla in Office Office). I am saving one star for the unfit climax but it hardly matters. Ajay Devgan has done it again!\n\nThere's no need to read what the plot is etc. Just go and watch to have a good time!!"

The same concept three or four stupids and jobless friends (still having some beautiful girl friends !! as the producer wants) messing around in the set. No script or real plot never required. Only some bluffs and confusions here and there for extracting a comedy out of a story less video. Every one will run and tell lie to every one making and absolute confusing and massacred situation (climax). And then all of a sudden every one will start running in a loop for another and the film will end (due to shortage of rills). Try to avoid it. BOLLYWOOD PLEASE LEAVE THIS FORMULA.....ROTTING SMELL IS COMING OUT"

        "review_detailed_main": "Ajay devgan production, well, thats good since, he can't act so much compared to his fellow colleagues who've gone high like Akshay. He wants to produce now. Good stay on this, and don't act.\n\nThe movie is a time pass fun. The fun really doesn't begin until Dharm(played by Sanjay Dutt) the elder brother arrives. Upon his arrival there are series of lies which follow after one and another that point is where the comedy start but very much expected. The movie is given cool look. Sanjay Dutt steals the show basically. Being a Ajay Devgan fan, I expected much more. The leading ladies rock the party as with there glam. Songs are big and cool. The rest of the cast do there job very well. Johnny Lever come'on he can't be that comic with his glass of churaliya hai. If this movie is a sequael of golmaals then, don't watch it cause it's bad sequel. But fresh starters can enjoy some moments but not all. Fardeen gives a decent performance, Bipasha also is charming with her glam. Mogda hardly has anything to say expect for few lines in the movie. Sanjay Dutt is back with his comic charm and does still the lime off from Ajay and Fardeen. Watch it for him, he looks cool, with tattoos and comic scenes. He rocks, but the film is not even a masala mix, it's just whats us usually expected. Veer lies to his brother to get more money every month and upon surprise arrival of brother, there are series of act of lies which follow and that is where few comic moments are fun to watch but otherwise, a worse movie of Ajay. I would give a 4/10. Rohit Shetty the director does his job but needs to work harder to obtain a position in making comedies. Music is good for tittle song only. No story lies in today's movies. Leave your mind and thoughts behind and don't think while watching the movie. Watch it for Sanjay and if you don't have anything to watch. This movie is a time pass on DVD. Paisa Vassoool be nahin. I need my money back."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hindi comedies tend to be rather broad, and when I read the description of this movie, I thought, \"this sounds like a possibly entertaining romantic farce\", and it might have had some potential in that department. Unfortunately, it's the B'wood version of a genre that is perhaps best left to the French. It has its moments, but is more or less ruined by silly sound effects and repetitious, over-the-top character tics. With 20 or 30 minutes of judicious cuts, the movie would have been at least as, if not maybe more, enjoyable than it is in its present form. The idea of partner swapping and mistaken partner identity is nothing new in the world of farce, but this example lacks a great script and is probably doomed from the start because of it. The music is forgettable. I am a fan of Ajay Devgan, but he is considerably better suited to more serious roles, in my opinion. He was superb in Omkara, for example, but his gift is really not for broad comedy; I don't understand why he keeps making movies like this...he is better than the material he has been choosing."

No double meaning jokes which is a trademark of Rohit Shetty films. I have personally watched it more than 10 times whenever i need to timepass or there is nothing interesting to watch on TV. The stars of this film are Ajay, Sanjay Dutt and Sanjay mishra. Kalsekar too cracks me up with that \"Rolex ki ghadi\" part. However, as the film approaches climax, it kind of becomes bad hence it is not the best out there."
