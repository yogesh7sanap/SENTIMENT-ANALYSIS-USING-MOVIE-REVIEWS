She becomes a hard-nosed successful businesswoman. Darnell gets 5 months for insider trader after being outed by bitter ex Renault (Peter Dinklage). Her long-suffering assistant Claire Rawlings (Kristen Bell) finally quits. When she gets out of prison, she has nobody and nowhere to stay. She guilts Claire's daughter Rachel for a place to crash. She goes to Rachel's Dandelion meeting and decides to start the competing Darnell's Darlings to sell Claire's brownies. She convinces Claire to date Mike Beals (Tyler Labine) and quit her job under bad boss Dana Dandridge (Cecily Strong).\n\nSome of the jokes work well and some others are awkwardly bad. There are plenty of stupid pratfalls that aren't smart enough. Melissa needs to trim back those bad jokes that aren't working. She and husband Ben Falcone need help to sharpen up their material. The basic premise has good bones. They have the lovely Kristen Bell. The little girls are cute and the girl fight is hilarious. Melissa and Ben have a tendency to inject bad low-grade comedy in all the wrong places. This is better than some of their other comedies and this could have worked much better than this."

        "review_detailed_main": "I really hate it when bad movies happen to good people. Despite bursting onto the entertainment scene with a killer supporting role in Bridesmaids (2011) and a star turn in Mike & Molly (2010- present), Melissa McCarthy has struggled to find material truly worthy of her talent. She's a reliable box office draw and can be trusted to perform exceptionally well with an assortment of interesting characters so why is she constantly being saddled with wafer-thin plots, broad and boring scripts and paint-by-numbers directorial choices? Is it pride; risk aversion; nepotism?\n\nThe Boss is the story of Michelle Darnell (McCarthy) a larger-than- life business tycoon, who looses it all for insider trading and is forced to start from the bottom once more. Armed only with a mega- maniacal ego and aided by her former assistant turned partner Claire (Bell), Darnell desperately tries to claw her way up to the top of Chicago's industry professionals. Undermining her at every turn however, are a multitude of former colleagues and competition who will stop at nothing to keep her at bay. Her most nefarious foe is Renault (Dinklage) a former lover whose obsession with Darnell is rivaled only by his obsession with the ways of the Samurai.\n\nMcCarthy (predictably) does a stellar job channeling her inner Trump. The story begins with Darnell as a young girl being dropped off a number of times by would-be adoptive parents which, while being a lazy setup does give the audience a reference point in which to pin our aspirations. McCarthy takes that baton and runs with it; fleshing out the broadly drawn character into one you could imagine exists in real life. You're never made privy as to why everyone hates her and abandons her (other than Renault) though I suppose one could gleam such insights by her unofficial motto \"Family is for suckers.\" Also despite once again being a lazy setup, the emotional payoff by the end isn't exactly deserved, but thanks to McCarthy's sensitivity she at least saves it from being offensively ham-fisted.\n\nOne can't help but think there was a much better comedy left on the cutting room floor here. There are extended moments of improvisation that go no where, and could have been sacrificed for the sake of filling in plot-lines that are dropped or disappear into the ether. One particular plot-line surreptitiously involves Kathy Bates as Darnell's former sensei Ida Marquette who despises her but we never find out why. You'd think with two very talented actresses a moment of catharsis could have been captured on film but instead we get five minutes of McCarthy and Cedric Yarbrough taunting Claire for being the smartest gal in the room.\n\nSpeaking of Kristen Bell; the former Veronica Mars (2004-2007) star plays a variation of the nagging, humorless, smarter-than-thou wife we've seen in hundreds in sitcoms and comedic vehicles. Her character is so irredeemably oppressive and boring that when Claire and Darnell have the third act falling out we all know is coming, I was less worried about what would happen to her than I was about why no one was standing in front of Chicago's Cloud Gate sculpture during the film's wistful montage. Her character arc completes itself with a budding romance with Mike (Labine) that was neither interesting nor convincing.\n\nYet despite all it's faults, the movie achieves what it set out to achieve, that is to say it makes it's audience laugh and laugh often. This is largely accomplished on the strength of bawdy R-rated humor and McCarthy's shrewd comic timing. Peter Dinklage, who gives a particularly daffy performance, has a lot of fun riffing, joking and tumbling with McCarthy, thus saving the film's third act contrivance from completely ruining the movie. The Boss is certainly not worth the price of admission unless you're already a fan of Melissa McCarthy. Yet for those already annoyed by her shenanigans, The Boss is just further confirmation that she's simply playing to the Plebes."

        "review_detailed_main": "'THE BOSS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)\n\nSlapstick comedy flick, re-teaming actress Melissa McCarthy with writer/director Ben Falcone (her husband); the two previously performed the same duties on the 2014 hit comedy flick 'TAMMY'. McCarthy stars in the movie, and she also co-wrote the script; with Falcone and (actor turned first time screenwriter) Steve Mallory (who also played a small part in 'TAMMY'). The film costars Kristen Bell, Ella Anderson, Peter Dinklage, Tyler Labine and Kathy Bates (who also costarred in 'TAMMY'). It tells the story of a very successful businesswoman, named Michelle Darnell, who's imprisoned for insider trading, that tries to make a comeback by selling delicious brownies. Michelle Darnell is based on a character McCarthy previously created for the comedy troupe 'Groundlings'. The movie performed well at the Box Office (like all of McCarthy's films), but it also did poorly with critics (like almost all of McCarthy's movies). I liked it (like most of McCarthy's films).\n\nMichelle Darnell (McCarthy) was an extremely rich and powerful businesswoman; and then she was busted for insider trading. When she gets out of prison, 5 months later, none of her old business associates want anything to do with her anymore. Only Michelle's former dedicated assistant, Claire (Bell), will help her out. Claire lets Michelle stay with her, and her daughter Rachel (Anderson). At first the ex-con is extremely annoying, but then she learns to bond with Claire and Rachel; and when she learns how good Claire's home cooked brownies are, she gets an obsessive new business idea.\n\nI think McCarthy is a very talented comedic performer, and writer, and this character is brilliant. So the movie is definitely funny. It's a little hit-and-miss, but it's more hit than miss (I think). It's not hilarious, or an exceptionally well made film; but if your'e looking for laughs, it should deliver. Unless you're just not a fan of Melissa McCarthy, or her style of comedy (everyone has their own tastes), than this film probably isn't for you.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/- KJTB5KGois"

When men slap and kick each other in the movies nobody bats an eye. I believe that if the child gets in the movie business the parents are quite well aware of the pros and cons and they study the lines with their kids so its not Melissa's fault there. Shes a writer not a priest. There is a \"just for gags\" program on TV. Its stupid as hell but it makes people laugh. It's a comedy for goodness sake not a tfue story. As for the reviewer who told us to watch his review on YouTube... I wouldn't watch it even if you can pay me. Its not possible to sit for more than an hour in the movie and give it 1. Its not an ebay product. You only give it a 1 if you stayed for 5 minutes and felt it wasnt for you. This is a great comedy. Well done. Having said that... there were few mistakes like when Michelle told Claire that she had a cellmate for the last six months when really she was arrested for 5 months.\n\nWhat's with these critics who tell people not to watch certain movies? What the hell is that? Make your own conclusions yes... but dont tell people not to watch the movie just because you hated it. That's what shows that it goes deeper than the movie. I call that hating..."

If so, they are wrong. The thing is, with this movie in particular, it could have been very funny. Good cast, fair premise, but instead we ended up with a film that was nothing much more than garbage. When a movie ends and everyone is just looking at each other with, \"What the heck did we just waste money on?\" looks on their faces, it's not good. Even worse, waiting for this one to come on, we were treated to a couple of coming attractions with pictures as bad, or worse. Foul language, as if the writers have completely lost any ability to write witty, clever dialogue, or dialogue at all that isn't merely four letter words, over the top sex that, frankly, is not interesting, is tiresome, and is so over- done. Who decides to spend money putting out money for this stuff? Nobody with any intelligence, I'm thinking. Too bad. You're cheating movie audiences, big time."

There was nothing funny about the film---the violent attempt at slapstick humor failed. It was badly timed and came off rather flat. No one was likable except Peter Dinklage's role. Even then, he is shoved into a stereotype about funny midgets. What are we? 8 year old children? That was the last time I ever laughed simply because someone was shorter than average.\n\nThere is a way to mix violence/vulgarity to create a comedy (See Deadpool, Hot Fuzz, etc.), but The Boss definitely never even took off.

        "review_detailed_main": "Sometimes a filmmaker is simply too emotionally invested in a movie to see when it needs to be better than it's turning out to be. Of course, every filmmaker needs to be passionate about his/her cinematic endeavor, but there is such a thing as letting emotions get in the way of sound artistic judgment. It often happens when the same person both writes and directs a movie (his/her \"passion project\"), especially when also acting in the movie. Then, there's an even greater danger of things going wrong when these kinds of overlaps involve a married couple. It happened when Dax Shepard wrote, co-directed and starred in the pointless action-comedy \"Hit and Run\" (2012) which co-starred his real-life wife Kristen Bell. In 2014, another couple, Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcone, took the practice of overlapping jobs and complicating it with marriage to another level by co-writing and co-starring in \"Tammy\" while Falcone also directed. That movie made money, but was poorly received by most critics and many Movie Fans as well. 2016 has the pair taking the same chance with the comedy \"The Boss\" (R, 1:39), which, ironically, co-stars Kristen Bell (but her husband is nowhere in sight). So, is \"The Boss\"\u0085 boss? Read on.\n\nMcCarthy stars as Michelle Darnell, a high-powered businesswoman and motivational speaker whose childhood (back and forth between an orphanage and foster care) taught her that the only person she can depend on is herself. She's self-centered, arrogant and basically amoral. Michelle generally uses and abuses her personal assistant, Claire (Bell), and Michelle's bodyguard isn't much more than her personal hype man. When Michelle is arrested for insider trading and sent to jail for five months, everyone abandons her, former lover and long-time business rival Renault (Peter Dinklage) buys her companies and the authorities freeze all of her remaining assets. Looks like someone has to start all over again.\n\nWhen Michelle is released from jail, she doesn't have anyone to call or anywhere to go, so she takes a taxi to Claire's apartment. When Claire gets home from her new job (where she works for a crazy Darnell disciple played by SNL's Cecily Strong), Claire's pre-teen daughter, Rachel (Ella Anderson), convinces her mom that they have to do something to help Michelle. Claire allows her former boss to stay in the apartment until she gets back on her feet, but Michelle's feet remain reclined on Claire's couch until Claire forces Michelle to do something to earn her keep. Michelle takes Rachel to her Dandelions meeting (think Girl Scouts) where the troop leader (Kristen Schaal) is discussing their cookie sales.\n\nMichelle gets an idea that her \"way back\" is to form a group called Darnell's Darlings which will teach girls business skills as they sell the unusually delicious brownies that Claire makes from an old family recipe. Michelle gets Claire to make the brownies and help with the troop and gets Rachel to help her recruit various tough girls and other misfits to join up and sell brownies for a percent of the profits. Michelle also approaches her estranged former mentor (Kathy Bates) for financing to help expand the business, but as all this is going on, Renault and his equally evil assistant (Timothy Simons) are keeping tabs on Michelle and her new business, hoping to increase the payback that he feels her still owes her.\n\n\"The Boss\" is mostly unoriginal, uninspired, unrealistic and unfunny. The clich\u00e9d plot lazily recycles the often used story of a main character who has been hardened by a tough life and doesn't know how to give or receive love. Falcone's direction randomly makes use of McCarthy's talent for physical comedy, but rarely gets her or the other actors to show us anything interesting or even very likable about their characters. Both the script and the acting give us characters who often change their tones and their attitudes toward other characters abruptly and with no clear reason why. We also see characters meeting for the first time, but acting like they already know each other, again without explanation.\n\nThere is also a lack of realism in the way the script portrays the fallout from Michelle's crimes, and her business dealings as the head of Darnell's Darlings, but this comedy's biggest flaw is its lack of\u0085 comedy. There are a few laughs to be found here and there, but the movie's other problems just kill the mood. Besides that, the movie's attempts at humor are overly dependent on cartoonish violence involving children, cursing around, by and at children, and vulgar sexual references which come off as more crude than funny. McCarthy herself has been much funnier in previous films and hopefully she'll be funnier again in her future projects. Sadly, her character in this film is one boss who should be fired herself. \"D+\""

        "review_detailed_main": "\"I don't need anyone. I'm going straight to the top.\" Michelle Darnell (McCarthy) has had a hard life. Living in and out of orphanages growing up hardened her and made her the woman she is today; one of the richest and most powerful women in the world, and former prison inmate. When she is released she has nothing and no one to turn to, except her former assistant Claire (Bell). Willing to accept her in for a few days but after Michelle takes Claire's daughter to her Girl Scout meeting everything changes. After watching the last few McCarthy movies I have said that she only has a few movies left before her humor starts to get played out. After watching this one I realize that I am wrong. She is as hilarious as ever in this one and is one of her best movies she has ever made. She really lets loose in this movie and says and does things that are different then her usual unsure of herself characters, and it works. There is something about her that is just so likable that even when she plays a character like this you can't help but laugh with, and not at. Overall, one of the funniest and smartest comedies I have seen in a while. I laughed out loud many many times watching this, and I watched by myself. McCarthy is a comic genius and I can't wait till her next movie. Watch this today, unless you offend easy. I easily give this an A\u0085a very very hilarious A."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ah, where to start? Perhaps to mention the whole theater was in stitches most of the time? That's always a good sign, even if I missed some lines due to the noise of the laughter.\n\nOne quick thing to get out of the way: The plot was basically a vehicle to move from one funny scene to the next. There was something about a rich woman who lost everything and tries to get it all back, but that wasn't really important. This movie could have been just as much fun if it involved game show hosts or ballerinas, but the plot as written was fully passable. Remember folks, this was not a drama, but an actual comedy.\n\nIf hovering undecided over the button on Netflix, the best thing to ask yourself is if you've enjoyed other movies with Melissa McCarthy. She was an absolute scene stealer throughout this movie. She was unabashedly foul-mouthed and as politically incorrect as could be. Kristen Bell got to play the uptight, straight man (or person, in PC-speak).\n\nAnother sign of a good movie is I never checked my watch once. There even a few good sight gags, something sadly missing in so many high-brow flicks. I'll never look at a sofa bed the same way... It's been a couple of days since we saw this, and my wife and I are still chuckling over this one. It was quite the pleasant surprise.\n\nPay attention to Melissa McCarthy's costumes. She wears a turtleneck in every scene, even as a child. Some were quite over the top, practically covering her chin. This was a running sight gag throughout the movie. It had me chuckling, anticipating each new scene just to see how outlandish the next costume would be."

What set McCarthy apart in the movies where she shines is that she's the one being crass and crude, surrounded by more normal people who make her stand out. In this movie, everyone seems to be trying to be just as crass and crude, if not more so, including the numerous girls playing Girl-Scout-like cookie sellers who get into a street brawl over cookie-selling territory. Poorly written movie. Not funny. Despite that, the movie is doing well in the box office. It's hard to imagine the audiences for this. Too crude to take kids. Not enough adult humor for adults."

She has just been released and wants to become something huge, something big and ready to become \"America's sweetheart.\" All the people she messed over aren't quite willing to forgive her. Very simple plot.\n\nMelissa Mccarthy is just plain horrible. We all know that her character is unlikable, but this was beyond a joke. In the movie world if you decide to create a very obnoxious, nasty, mean, and repulsive character...it can work...but the actor/actress playing this character needs to be able to bring something great to the table and by acting greatly and making you appreciate this horrible/unlikable character. Melissa Mccarthy does none of this, and therefor makes it completely outrageous and leaving you in total discomfort for a full 90 mins. Kristen Bell was horribly casted and was just pointless. Peter Dinklage was the only decent thing about this film, and he managed to give us a few chuckles. That's the sign of a good actor. But he's used as the stereotypical midget and we are laughing at his advantage. Again, it just didn't work.\n\nWomen and slapstick comedy - a mixture that fails abysmally. And this movie does just that. Nothing worked. It was a horrible combination. I will never watch this again. I disliked Tammy, but this one was even worse! It was just horrible. 1/5 stars. 1/10.

So what were these people expecting from the movie? The trailer sums it up perfectly. I honestly think most people are upset simply because of the vulgar language/jokes while there are children in the movie. Including some of those vulgar remarks are made by the children. So if you look at that as being bad, don't watch the movie.

It mocks women and even worse, young girls. That is not funny. Second, the movie is poorly acted. Third, the movie experiments with gender role switching with poor results. Fourth, the principal player, Melissa McCarthy just is not funny. She is loud and obnoxious. Actually, it all comes down to this: gals acting like nasty wise-guys just does not work, at least not for this writer. Lucille Ball was funny, Joan Davis was funny, Jean Stapleton was funny, Irene Ryan was funny, Rosalind Russell was funny, Gracie Allen was funny, Shelly Long is funny, Barbra Streisand is funny, Melissa McCarthy is not funny. Women punching each other in the face is not funny. Young girls brawling is not funny. What's worse, the movie early on establishes that McCarthy's character, the Boss, is a rotten person and shows it. She generates no empathy. She does stuff that is really hurtful and nasty. The one strong male character in this movie, played by a midget who actually is funny, despises the Boss and with good reason: she used him to get a promotion and then dumped him. Throughout the story she is the cause of all the interpersonal conflicts. In fact, she is intensely disliked, and with good reason: the character is repulsive. She is pushy, a hustler, loud, obnoxious, aggressive, and physically unattractive. That alone would not necessarily render her humorless. The problem is that she has no redeeming qualities to make her lovable. She's not warm, endearing, sensitive or even misunderstood by others. Her abrasive personality is as transparent as clear glass. She is not the victim; she is the perpetrator. And that is not funny. What's next: a female version of The Three Stooges (Mai, Lara and Coochie)? Or what about a movie featuring a female version of Harold Lloyd? Or what about a movie about a female Sad Sack (Sadie Sack?) Or what about an all-female version of Gomer Pyle, USMC? (Scene: affable but slow-witted Gina Pyle is berated by her hysterical sergeant, Violet Carter). Or what about an updated version of All in the Family with Archie transformed into Alma, Edith into Alma's clueless husband Eddie, Gloria into Alma's hysterical son Glen and Mike into Alma's obnoxious daughter-in-law Midge?

I was saddened to see a script that to me downgrades women which is not at all funny. I must be honest and admit I did not stay to see the whole film so there may have been an improvement further on which I missed as I left the cinema. This experience has discouraged any further viewing of Ms McCarthy's work which is a pity. This film had all the makings of good entertainment and would be more successful if the language was cleaned up. However, perhaps I am old-fashioned!"

Melissa McCarthy has not built her career on subtlety, but even for her standards, this latest comes across as a lazy effort with missed opportunities for both laughs and a message.\n\nMs. McCarthy re-teams with those responsible for Tammy (2014), including her husband writer/director Ben Falcone and co-writer Steve Mallory. Here she plays Michelle Darnell, an egotistical hyped-up business tycoon with no sense of integrity or humanity \u0085 constantly wearing an odd turtleneck. Somehow the filmmakers thought it a good idea to explain this lack of soul showing a young Michelle being continually \"returned\" to her orphanage (run by a nun played by Margo Martindale).\n\nWhen Michelle's business rival (and former business associate and former lover) Renault/Ron (Peter Dinklage) turns her into the SEC for insider trading, the correlations with Martha Stewart become impossible to ignore. There is even an acknowledgment of this by McCarthy's character. Once released from white collar prison, Michelle hits rock bottom and ends up sleeping on her former assistant's sofa. Kristen Bell is Claire, the assistant that Michelle once dumped on and now crashes with. Ms. Bell is mostly relegated to \"straight man\" to McCarthy's string of lame punchlines.\n\nIn the spirit of exaggeration in lieu of creativity, three scenes in particular stand out: the street fight between rival scout troops, a ridiculous breast grope-off with McCarthy and Bell, and a clumsily staged sword fight between McCarthy and Dinklage. The missed opportunity to have a point about girls in business, and stooping to schmaltz with the Michelle family story are every bit as disappointing as the mostly unfunny and constant use of profanity-laced insults. Saying \"suck his d***\"over and over in one scene does not make it funny \u0085 in fact, it's a bit sad.\n\nExacerbating the frustration is the misuse and underuse of such talents as Cecily Strong, Kristen Schaal, Tyler Labine, and Kathy Bates. Ella Anderson as Claire's daughter does come across as a real kid, and she's part of the best scenes in the movie. Somehow a movie that (finally) calls out the Girl Scouts on their unfair-to-girls business model, manages to disappoint on every other front."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Boss is another vehicle to demonstrate Melissa McCarthy's comedic talent and flair which cemented her win as MTV Movie Award's first ever female winner for the Comedic Genius Award earlier this year, managing to bring some of the scripts duller moments to life while managing to make the genuinely hilarious moments even bigger and better than expected. Without her, I cannot help but think the film would collapse around her, but her involvement (matched with the character and supporting cast) make the film a success. I struggle to comprehend the negative reviews for this film, as it is nothing but enjoyable from start to finish. A success that should tide McCarthy over until Ghostbusters, in just a few weeks...\n\nSummary: Melissa McCarthy is absolutely The Boss, adding another notch to her belt of impressive comedy and hilarious characters, registering in the higher end of her filmography, despite what reviewers would make you believe.\n\nI truly do not understand the hate that this filming is attracting. It's pretty damn hilarious if you ask me.\n\nFULL REVIEW: http://goo.gl/03vrSb"

Ms. McCarthy plays a woman who was mostly raised in an orphanage who grows to be a very powerful woman until...well, if you're really curious, watch the movie. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it. She and Kristen Bell seem to have some good chemistry though not enough for me to highly recommend this. Peter Dinklage also was a little amusing.

I actually enjoyed the bloopers during the credits much more than the movie itself because they at least made me laugh a couple of times.\n\nThe plot is unbelievable, ridiculous and not very funny. Melissa co-wrote it, which is unfortunate as I expected better from her. Melissa plays an emotionally corrupt, mouthy, brash business woman with few morals. The rest of the supporting cast are simply over-the-top stereotypes. I'm surprised that Kathy Bates, Peter Dinklage and Kristen Bell accepted this movie, as surely they must have read the script first? This is not clever writing. Save your money for more worthy film."

        "review_title": "The Boss is a mostly unfunny clich\u00e9 of foul jokes and predictable scouting story lines. This box of cookies is not worth buying!",
        "review_detailed_main": "A story clich\u00e9 that's often used for comedies, especially family comedies, are the ones where an adult is thrown in to the world of a child's, sometimes by choice or by accident, and try to benefit from that. There is a lot of comedic potential from this kind of fish-out-of-water scenario, considering if their character is out of their element or if the children know more about the subject that the main character is about to face. Movies like Bushwacked, Troop Beverly Hills and even Ernest Goes to Camp not only uses this story element, but also throws in the theme of camping or scouting.\n\nThis also has comedic potential (even if the previous examples aren't good ones), as the idea of scouting is often the first time children get the chance to become adults while retaining innocence, and yet the adult in question would be getting a dose of how much harder it can be to return to such a carefree time. One element that turns girls into women is when their tasked to selling cookies for their troop. Rather then tackle this idea as a family film, The Boss goes for a full, hard R rated comedy the tries to push how bad a person can be.\n\nMichelle Darnell (played by Melissa McCarthy) is a successful businesswoman (I don't think were told exactly what it is she made or did) who prides herself through expensive self-help seminars and daily richly living. She cares little for anyone, even her never sleeping assistant Clair Rawlins (played by Kristen Bell). One day, Michelle's business enemy, a Japanese culture loving Renault (played by Peter Dinklage), exposes her insider trading, which puts her in prison for five months, along with her property seized by the government and her bank accounts frozen, putting back at square one.\n\nWith no place to go and no one willing to work with her, she shows up at the front door of Claire, who lives with her young daughter Rachel, and has taken a new job. She lets Michelle stay with them, but forces her to help out, including taking Rachel to her scouting meeting. It's here where she discovers that the girl's troop sells a high amount of cookies. It's here where she's inspired to make a brand new scouting troop that sells brownies that are cooked by Claire and twenty percent of the profits go back to the girls.\n\nWhile I wouldn't call Melissa McCarthy a comedic genius, but you'd think a talent like her would have had a lot more to offer for The Boss. Directed by McCarthy's husband Ben Falcone (who also directed the really bad Tammy), much of The Boss rides on how foul she can be in front of children. This wouldn't be a bad thing, but like how Tammy attempted to put in some unneeded drama, this also tries to sneak in some schmaltzy material about the importance of family and such. That's not going to work as this is supposed to be an R rated story for adults and not for kids.\n\nMaking an R rated movie around something that's supposed to be child friendly is a extremely tough sell and this movie justifies why something like The Boss shouldn't be pursued without an intelligent script. As is, I laughed a few times, but mostly by how insane McCarthy can be with her character. Both Kristen Bell and Peter Dinklage try their best, but the material gives them little to work with, and their stuck telling predictable jokes with a predictable story.\n\nI'll give this three boxes of cookies out of ten. The Boss is a mostly forgettable comedy that we can toss into the bargain bin that will probably satisfy those that want cheap laughs. I hope McCarthy can show a lot more creative idea with her upcoming Ghostbusters movie. I know she's capable of a ton of laughs (no pun on her weight)."

        "review_title": "An absolute mess",
        "review_detailed_main": "Let me start by saying something very bluntly - Melissa McCarthy and her husband Ben Falcone need to stop writing movies. They are tarnishing McCarthy's career. Ever since her Oscar-nominated performance in 'Bridesmaids' McCarthy has been hot property in Hollywood. Yet nearly everything she has starred in since has been an abysmal movie (with the exception of 'Spy'). If things continue this way for much longer she will no longer be hot property and her career will likely fall by the wayside. So to be entrusting the writing of her scripts, at the peak of her career, to herself and her husband (who have never written before) is nothing short of insane. They first gave it a go in 2014 with 'Tammy' and the general consensus was that it was pretty bad, and yet here they are again two years later with 'The Boss', and I can confirm without a shadow of a doubt, it's really bad.\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind as being a major issue is the story. Selling cookies and battling a rival group? This wouldn't even pass for an episode of a sitcom. I know what you're thinking though, if the characters are strong enough the story shouldn't matter too much. Let me assure you this is far from the case. The characters are dreadful. Almost every one of them in the film is completely unrealistic and over the top, and yet at the same time incredibly boring. The jokes are amateurish and would struggle to make in immature five-year-old laugh most of the time. The film also uses the same jokes over and over, at one point even twice in a row within the space of a couple of minutes. If McCarthy really does have the comedic talent to carry Hollywood films (which I'm starting to doubt truth be told) she needs to find a very fine set of writers to write a script that plays to her strengths. And she needs to find them fast."

        "review_title": "Melissa McCarthy steals the show by only a short shot",
        "review_detailed_main": "Melissa McCarthy has had plenty of ups and downs in her career. It seems in recent years she has gone back and forth from landing in hilarious roles to disappointing roles, her last major role being the action comedy 'Spy' from last year. She has often stolen the show in films directed by Paul Feig, 'Bridesmaids' and 'The Heat' to be more specific, but seems to slop in other roles. This film marks her second collaboration with her husband director Ben Falcone, the man behind the critically hammered 'Tammy' which starred McCarthy as the titular character. In this film, McCarthy plays Michelle Darnell, a chairwoman of a billion dollar company with her best friend Claire (played by Kristen Bell), a single mother of a pre-teen daughter Rachael (played by Ella Anderson), working by her side. In the process, she's made enemies with her former lover Renault (played by Peter Dinklage) after taking his position as manager, and he has vowed revenge against her ever since. After a botched interview with a television personality, Michelle is arrest for insider trading and sent to prison for six months. Upon release, Michelle stuck on the streets with her assets wiped clean, her home on foreclosure, and with nobody to turn to but Claire and her daughter who move her into their house in attempt to get her back on her feet.\n\nFor the past several years, McCarthey has proved her gift of comedic talent, and this movie does not fail to show it, but she certainly doesn't embrace her full potential in her smart-mouthed role here. What good does she bring to this movie exactly? Well, she doesn't fail bring on some occasional laughter enough to distract you from the thinly written script, and her comedic chemistry with Kristen Bell works, but the jokes don't always hit home. McCarthy tries desperately on bringing out laughter through her shamelessly vulgar dialogue, some of which in the presence of elementary school-aged Ella Anderson. In some scenes, the jokes work, and leave a fair number of people in my theater laughing. In other scenes, they tend to come off as bold and mean-spirited, or otherwise rather forced. A lot of it begins when her character volunteers for Kristen Bell's daughter's Girl Scout. As shown in the trailer, one scene features a violent street brawl between dozens of young-aged girls, a scene where we sit through little children engage in slow motion fist fights, throw each other against cars, karate kick each other in the face, etc. Apparently we are supposed to believe this is funny when it really just comes off as cruel and makes you feel guilty for laughing, if you happen to do so. As the most of the fun and hilarity take place during the first hour, the film completely drops the ball during the second hour and laughs come to a halt. That is when Peter Dinklage begins consuming some major screen time. This actor is shown to have comedic potential, but sadly it doesn't work. The jokes he shoots out never land and his comedic chemistry with McCarthy falls completely flat.\n\nThe biggest accolade The Boss manages to achieve is being slightly funnier and more fun to watch director Ben Falcone's previous film 'Tammy'. Overall, this definitely doesn't sit on the ladder of Melissa McCarthy's best works, not even close. She and Kristen Bell manage to steal the show here, but only by a short shot. This is comedy that will please mostly fans of Melissa McCarthy, but leave others with a cold shoulder."

        "review_title": "Mediocre Melissa Film That Lacks Quality Writing",
        "review_detailed_main": "Another beautiful day another reason to head back into the theater. Hi I'm Robbie Karim and that despicable display of comedy is my attempt at a funny opening for my latest review. Today we look at the latest production starring Melissa McCarthy called the Boss, a film that looks promising for a quick laugh. However, does this movie shine in terms of quality or is it another mediocre media designed to net our money? Let's get this review started then and see if we can answer that question.\n\nTHE GOOD: \u0095 Very funny moments \u0095 Cute moral built into the movie \u0095 Fairly Fast pace \u0095 McCarthy's acting\n\nThe Boss is certainly a humorous film that uses a lot of McCarthy's old tricks that we've become accustomed to. McCarthy herself bears most of the comedic weight using her delivery as the main punch to get you laughing. She's loud, drawn out, and she has the sass that I can't help but chuckle at every now and then. Kristen Bell and Ella Anderson assisted with keeping the film fun in two ways. The first, and major contribution was being the medium for McCarthy to bounce her jokes off, where they acted as props to react and keep the rants going. And the second contribution was bringing the cute, life lessons that every comedy film seems to need. In the Boss' case, that moral is family and these three actresses do make a fun, interesting family to watch. This dynamic keeps the plot going and thanks to some decent editing helps avoid some longwinded and slow plots that Hollywood likes to waste our time with.\n\nTHE BAD: \u0095 A lot of scenes already shown in the trailers \u0095 Some comedic scene went on too long \u0095 Not the most unique or original film \u0095 Too much obsession with genitalia and sex\n\nNo surprise that the trailers give a lot of comedy away and the Boss is another victim of this trend. You will catch a lot of the more unique moments on the commercials, which depending on how much TV you watch, can dilute the comedic punch it was intended to bring. Fortunately there were still golden nuggets still buried in the movie, but even these weren't as funny as some of the other things that have come out of McCarthy's films. The problem was these jokes weren't that original, easily blending in with the sea of Melissa McCarthy jokes that we've seen. In addition, the scenes not shown in the commercials centered very heavily on sex, which seems to be the only medium they think audiences like. The Boss doesn't even try to put cleverness behind their dialogue, instead relying on the delivery and a low comedy threshold to carry their writing. If relentless vulgarity is your bread and butter, this is the movie for you, but for me well it got old after a while, especially when you see as many films as I do. I can't deny I laughed at a few dirty moments, but some scenes where they bantered on and on crossed over the stupid line.\n\nThe Final Verdict: The Boss is a fun film that takes its place in the mediocre works meant to kill time. However it certainly isn't the greatest of Melissa McCarthy's works and the lack of originality, wit, or even balance are the components that weaken this film. But it still feels like a Melissa McCarthy film and those who are extreme fans of this movie will laugh their heads off regardless of the stale tactics and lazier writing. Regardless I can't recommend this one for a trip to the theater, but then again I'm just a reviewer and can only share my opinions. Again this is a fun Melissa McCarthy movie and will most likely crack everyone up, I'm just not the biggest fan of sexual humor and I see more movies and trailers that really dilute humor for me.\n\nMy scores are:\n\nComedy: 6.5 Movie Overall: 6.0"

Personally, i myself think it's a huge lesbian joke that every TV show be it cable, satellite, netflix, syfy, such as The 100, Z Nation, etc., etc., etc, turns q previously hetero character into a lesbian just for a few hot lesbian scenes instead of introducing new characters who are already lesbian. I don't see anyone getting upset about that big joke.\n\nI happen to be pretty fat, and I laugh at fat jokes. I laugh at funny fat jokes, let me clarify. So if you are sensitive to just about anything, don't watch this.\n\nIt seems the only thing we are supposed to laugh at when it's insulted these days is white people.\n\nGood nuff movie to rent, don't buy it, it's not worth buying, but is a good Red Box rental especially for a double feature night.\n\nI don't expect all movies to be perfectly polished and politically correct blockbuster hits.

I think she brought her A game, but the movie itself is a C tops.\n\nKristen Bell for the most part was the straight man to McCarthy's comedy, but the chemistry between these two seemed lackluster. Tyler Labine seems to be going somewhere as Bell's love interest, but his screen time was really coming to little too late.\n\nThe concept of a Martha Stewart styled situation, bouncing back by selling girl scout cookies was Boss. The material with McCarthy interacting with the girls and teaching them big business is funny.\n\nBut the big laughs... Peter Dinklage (pun implied). He plays McCarthy's ex-lover turned business rival, and his whole persona of a wound tightly Mongol who keeps focus with his interest in Japanese Samurai culture was golden. I loved all of it.\n\nOverall, it's good for a few laughs, if you catch it on Netflix, but it's not the strongest comedy one of the Queens of comedy as every done."

McCarthy did not bring any real depth or humor to the character, and poor Kristen Bell must not be getting any real offers (she is sadly cast as the wet blanket once again).

        "review_detailed_main": "Melissa McCarthy is definitely hot in Hollywood right now. Her Oscar nomination for Bridesmaids in 2011, didn't just give her respect in the business, but also more opportunities to make films. So what did she chose to do with her time. In The Boss she is directed by her husband Ben Falcone, after a screenplay they have both written together. She plays Michelle Darnell, a business woman who built her own economical empire from scratch. After being sentenced to prison for insider trading, she is later released completely bankrupt and forced to stay on the couch with her ex assistant Claire, played by Kristen Bell. Here she puts Claire in trouble when she suddenly sees a business opportunity in her daughter's girls scout cookie sales.\n\nI have to be completely honest and say that it is difficult for me to find anything positive to say about this film. McCarthy plays Michelle as an unsympathetic devil, which appears to be meant to create humor in the contrast between what is morally right to do, and what she chooses to do. The problem is that the film completely lacks comical timing and jokes that actually works. Minutes long breast jokes are mixed with girls fighting each other bloody and other scenes loaded with boring stereo types that just doesn't work anymore. I think that in the middle of this mess, the filmmakers sort of forgot what kind of film this was meant to be. Is it supposed to be a fun family film with a cookie selling daughter, or more closely to black humor with jokes about death, illness and other normally tense subjects? I just don't know.\n\nThe Boss is badly edited, badly told from a dramaturgical point of view, and also incredibly predictable. Don't get me wrong, a lot of classic drama is predictable but if the rest of the film is below tolerable, you just don't care anymore and long for the film to end. Who even thinks that it is fun with an arrogant lady who tries to sell cookies to get rich? Very strange plot even to begin with. I find it very difficult to see where this film could have been saved. Very few things are even good to begin with, but the worst part as I mentioned before, is the extremely bad and terribly timed jokes. Watch the film and see for yourselves. But do it on your own risk. Because of the limited opportunities to makes this film even slightly better than it is (and it is not good to begin with), I can't grade it anything else than low.\n\nDavid Lindahl - www.filmografen.se"

The great script was written around a really good brownie recipe, and McCarthy's ruthless \"Michelle Darnell\" runs into legal problems, then has to deal with innocent \"Girl Scout\" types, and decent grownups. Dinklage's character (He did this on a hiatus during GOT) is a very bad man who fights Darnell for the business. I think most people, by far, will like this one. The numbers above were just up to 12 June 2016, and the overseas profit must have been HUGE. I can't wait to see how it ends, so here I go."

        "review_detailed_main": "Melissa McCarthy stars in \"The Boss\" from 2016, also starring Kristen Bell and Peter Dinklage.\n\nMcCarthy plays a tycoon businesswoman Michelle Darnell, who loses everything when she's found guilty of insider trading and goes to prison. When she is released, she has nowhere to go, so she hits up her ex-assistant Claire (Bell) for a place to stay. Claire has a young daughter, Rachel, and Claire asks Michelle to take her to a Young Dandelions meeting - the Young Dandelions are similar to the girl scouts. There, she gets the idea to recruit some of the Dandelions and go into business selling Claire's fabulous brownies. It takes off, with Claire as 50% partner. But an ex-boyfriend and enemy (Dinklage) is anxious to ruin Michelle yet again.\n\nI have no problem with swearing, no problem with sex, but if there's one thing I have no tolerance for is vulgarity. And the humor here is vulgar and geared to the lowest common denominator. Why someone as talented as Melissa McCarthy does this type of film is beyond me. She's better than this - either she or Hollywood don't think so. Is it because she's overweight? If so it's even more insulting.\n\nI'm a huge fan of Kristen Bell's and wish this had been a better role for her.\n\nThere were some funny slapstick scenes and the premise was good, as was the cast, but the script was bad. And tasteless."

It's not realistic, it has formulaic elements, but the production values are great, the actors commit to their roles and it's an enjoyable escape. And McCarthy is superb--as are the rest of the cast members."

In the first ten minutes, three key scenes (an opening orphanage scene, then her seminar, then the conversation between her, her assistant and bodyguard) are just lacking any punch at all - there's just nothing to even smile at.

The first 5 minutes was the best, the rest of the time I struggled not to turn off the movie.\n\nThe cast was better than main star Kristen Bell, Tyler Labine, Kristen Schaal but the one that made me laugh most of all was Peter Dinklage but not even he could save this movie.\n\nThe Boss tries too hard to be funny and is a forgettable movie (thank god).

Unfortunately, and before midpoint, this goes completely off the rails, and aside from the way too trite story element of emotional denial and epiphany. You keep wanting someone to give McCarthy something decent to work with. The earlier, admittedly very broad farce simply degenerates into stupid and unfunny cartoonishness, and it's just too bad. You can almost feel the actors' wondering of how and why any comic promise was allowed to be destroyed. Melissa and we deserve better."

        "review_detailed_main": "Melissa McCarthy has had plenty of ups and downs in her career. It seems in recent years she has gone back and forth from landing in hilarious roles to disappointing roles, her last major role being the action comedy 'Spy' from last year. She has often stolen the show in films directed by Paul Feig, 'Bridesmaids' and 'The Heat' to be more specific, but seems to slop in other roles. This film marks her second collaboration with her husband director Ben Falcone, the man behind the critically hammered 'Tammy' which starred McCarthy as the titular character. In this film, McCarthy plays Michelle Darnell, a chairwoman of a billion dollar company with her best friend Claire (played by Kristen Bell), a single mother of a pre-teen daughter Rachael (played by Ella Anderson), working by her side. In the process, she's made enemies with her former lover Renault (played by Peter Dinklage) after taking his position as manager, and he has vowed revenge against her ever since. After a botched interview with a television personality, Michelle is arrest for insider trading and sent to prison for six months. Upon release, Michelle stuck on the streets with her assets wiped clean, her home on foreclosure, and with nobody to turn to but Claire and her daughter who move her into their house in attempt to get her back on her feet.\n\nFor the past several years, McCarthey has proved her gift of comedic talent, and this movie does not fail to show it, but she certainly doesn't embrace her full potential in her smart-mouthed role here. What good does she bring to this movie exactly? Well, she doesn't fail bring on some occasional laughter enough to distract you from the thinly written script, and her comedic chemistry with Kristen Bell works, but the jokes don't always hit home. McCarthy tries desperately on bringing out laughter through her shamelessly vulgar dialogue, some of which in the presence of elementary school-aged Ella Anderson. In some scenes, the jokes work, and leave a fair number of people in my theater laughing. In other scenes, they tend to come off as bold and mean-spirited, or otherwise rather forced. A lot of it begins when her character volunteers for Kristen Bell's daughter's Girl Scout. As shown in the trailer, one scene features a violent street brawl between dozens of young-aged girls, a scene where we sit through little children engage in slow motion fist fights, throw each other against cars, karate kick each other in the face, etc. Apparently we are supposed to believe this is funny when it really just comes off as cruel and makes you feel guilty for laughing, if you happen to do so. As the most of the fun and hilarity take place during the first hour, the film completely drops the ball during the second hour and laughs come to a halt. That is when Peter Dinklage begins consuming some major screen time. This actor is shown to have comedic potential, but sadly it doesn't work. The jokes he shoots out never land and his comedic chemistry with McCarthy falls completely flat.\n\nThe biggest accolade The Boss manages to achieve is being slightly funnier and more fun to watch director Ben Falcone's previous film 'Tammy'. Overall, this definitely doesn't sit on the ladder of Melissa McCarthy's best works, not even close. She and Kristen Bell manage to steal the show here, but only by a short shot. This is comedy that will please mostly fans of Melissa McCarthy, but leave others with a cold shoulder."

There's no single point that she really makes this role her own, instead of weakly impersonating Danny McBride and Vince Vaughn in their most boring movies.\n\nThanks to the McCarthy's current star power and marketing it as a straight comedy, it managed to get 80 mil USD from cinemas. Way more than it deserves!\n\nConsidering that McCarthy is also one of the screenwriters, and her husband Ben Falcone director and also one of the writers, it's surprising how they can't play to leading lady's strengths.\n\nComparing to other recent big-name comedies, it's as useless as \"Zoolander 2\" and \"Anchorman 2\"."

Melissa McCarthy did her best with what she was given, but they didn't utilize her full capabilities as an actor. Kristen Bell's character was genuinely boring. Tyler Labine played in an unfortunate role but, like McCarthy, he did his best.\n\nThe drug references in this move weren't funny. The samurai references weren't funny. The sexual more-than-references weren't funny. The couch-flip was funny in the previews but in the movie it was no longer a surprise. There needed to be more moments that surprised the audience like that. The constant references to the tall girl being tall... Yeah, not funny after a hundred times. Once. That's a one-time joke.\n\nI think that's partly what happened. Any actually funny material was replayed over and over so that the original joke didn't even get a chuckle toward the end. You can do it, writers. We believe in you.\n\nI don't think the actors did anything wrong here, but the writing was very odd (lazy) and the pacing poor. They lingered where they didn't need to linger and ignored opportunities that could have been very funny. I had high hopes for this movie, which definitely contributes to my disappointment."

In this movie she plays Michelle Darnell who is the 47th wealthiest woman in the world and just a titan of industry but other than that her character very flat and the material is just over used. Director Ben Falcone also known for Tammy (2014) another immature adult comedy just like this one.\n\nAfter being released from jail she seems lost and tries to seek the help of Claire (Bell) and her daughter Rachel (Anderson) to try an make herself a better person. She gives Rachel some business advice to run a successful cookie company and she gives Claire advice on dating. Peter Dinklage who plays Renault (not the car) is just as equally bad even he doesn't make the film any better.\n\nJust so you know this is an adult comedy but it just feels rushed and isn't the raw humor we're used to from McCarthy. There is no story and no character development it feels rushed, and made me feel guilty for watching it as if to say \"why am I watching this.\" It certainly isn't as funny and as enjoyable as last years Spy which was the funniest film of 2015 and just a balls out smash. There are two funny moments in this film and only two this should be left alone.\n\nHere are some points as to why this comedy should be avoided:\n\nCharacter: Michelle Darnell has a very Trump-esque feel to her and other than her just being the 47th richest in the world, again like in Tammy her character feels rushed. Michell starts life as an orphan being taken in and out of the orphanage where she lives even when she tries to change she is still a bad character, and still over done. Just as humorous as she was in Bridesmaids.\n\nStory: Other than the story of her being wealthy there is no other story better than that, it's not even well written by Falcone or Steve Mallory. To be frank this is just a plot-less and unfunny mess. I miss Spy. Renault's story is no better he is a business man who likes to take whatever everybody else has got because he feels he should have it. The story is just to real life it's just silly.\n\nThis a cheaply done comedy and I thought comedy meant funny but this is just unfunny and as I said before just a mess. Like Tammy this is one to be missed.\n\nVerdict: Stupid and immature. Melissa is not her funniest and not her silliest if you like Melissa McCarthy just avoid this. Comedy not worth watching.\n\n4/10 plain bad."

The plot was shaky at best, the jokes toed an odd line between being childish and very crude, and the end result was a disappointment. The film felt awkward, forced, and cheap throughout its entirety. After watching, I was honestly confused as to why Kathy Bates and Peter Dinklage agreed to have any role in the film whatsoever. I felt as if Melissa McCarthy was simply yelling at me for the entire movie, and was hoping that I would laugh either out of confusion or because that was what I was supposed to do. It wasn't the worst movie I had ever seen, and I would be lying if I said I did not laugh a few times as I watched. The Boss has a few laughs in it that will make you not completely regret spending your time watching it, but as you watch it, you will probably think that the movie is a quickly and poorly made sham."

As for me, I think the film was missing something most comedies have...a reason to care about the leading character.\n\nMelissa McCarthy plays Michelle Darnell, a self-help guru who treats everyone around her like dirt. She's amassed a huge fortune by lecturing, selling books and more....much like a foul-mouthed version of Tony Robbins. However, when she's convicted of insider trading, she's sent to prison. While the sentence isn't very long, when she leaves she learns that pretty much everything she owned has been confiscated. So, she moves in with her old assistant, Claire (Kristen Bell), though there is no conceivable reason why Claire would have anything to do with her...as she's completely repellent and awful and has learned nothing from her ordeal. She's also a god-awful influence on Claire's daughter. What's next and, more importantly, who cares?!\n\nIf the notion of seeing McCarthy play a god-awful character who constantly curses and acts vulgar, then this film is for you. Some vulgarity can be funny (such as in \"Step Brothers\")...constant vulgarity and nastiness simply makes you wonder \"what were these people thinking???!!!\". I thought it was all way over the top and nothing like her sweet film \"Spy\". I liked \"Spy\" and liked McCarthy's character. But with \"Boss\", I found her and her character very easy to hate. The film is occasionally funny...but not enough to make it possible to overlook McCarthy as Michelle. In fact, after a while I tired of all this and just turned it off and found something better...it was nearly over but I just didn't care."

Melissa McCarthy is the same character pretty much every movie and her act can be entertaining and if your a big fan of her you will probably like it. I am getting somewhat tired of it and it started after seeing Tammy but after seeing this one Tammy was actually not even that bad. This can be hard to watch and the plot isn't worth going into great detail but McCarthy stars a orphan turned millionaire who then loses her job again due to her ex boyfriend Renault who's real name is Ron. The movie has its moments mostly when McCarthy does things like gets thrown into a wall, or falling down a staircase or hitting a tennis ball at some guy. However the character she plays in this movie is unpleasant, she was an orphan who no-one liked and when she gets rich she treats everybody poorly and throughout the movie even when she is poor again she is crude nasty but not too funny. Another thing is that I can't tell who the target audience is there's a kid who's in the movie and makes it feel like a family comedy but then she does some horrible things that shouldn't be in a family movie. I got pretty stoned during this movie and even then it was hard to sit to but I am just not into McCarthy enough where I can enjoy a whole 90 minutes of her comedy . Like I said if you're into McCarthy you might like it but otherwise not really worth a watch"

        "review_detailed_main": "Review: When this film started, I must admit I couldn't stop laughing but once it settles down, the jokes become more silly than funny. Melissa McCarthy plays Michelle Darnell, whose an extremely successful business woman with ruthless business methods. After growing up in a orphanage, and constantly sent back by her adopted parents, Ida Marquette (Kathy Bates), takes her under her wing, and shows her how to succeed in business, without caring about her peers, or anyone that surrounds her. Her right-hand girl, Claire (Kristen Bell), puts up with her selfish attitude so she can have money for her young daughter, Rachel (Ella Anderson), and pay to live in her small apartment. When one of Michelle's business deals goes wrong, due to her archenemy and ex-lover Renault (Peter Dinklage), Michelle turns to Claire for help, even though she has taken on a degrading office job to pay her bills. Whilst under her roof, Michelle finds it hard to ditch her bad habits but once she tastes Claire's delicious brownies, business alarm bells start to ring in her head. There are some touching moments in the movie and I did rewind the bed and rapping scenes a couple of times but the rest of the film seemed like a bunch of one-liners with Kristen Bell being the kill joy. Its a shame that Michelle's bodyguard, Tito (Cedric Yarbrough) exited the movie so early because I liked the banter between him and Michelle. Anyway, it's a watchable movie with a few funny scenes but the unrealistic plot became a bit silly after a while. Watchable!\n\nRound-Up: Melissa McCarthy, 46, is definitely becoming a certified, bankable star, who has hit the big time since her cameo role in Bridesmaids in 2011. With popular movies like Identity Thief, The Heat, the funny St. Vincent, Tammy, Spy and Ghostbusters in her portfolio, her quick rise to stardom, and dramatic weight lose, is definitely a huge achievement for the popular star. This movie was written and directed by Ben Falcone, 43, who has been married to Melissa McCarthy for some time, and also directed Tammy, which also starred McCarthy in the leading role. Although he has only directed 2 movies in his career, he has had small roles in his wife's movies and a few TV series. He didn't really push McCarthy to the limit in this movie, and we have all seen her play this type of role before but it wasn't bad for his second project. Personally, I was hoping for a bit more, after enjoying Spy so much, and after watching the movies outtakes, it would have been much better with Dave Bautista as her nemesis at school, but the director must have had his reasons to change at the last minute. Anyway, it's light-hearted fun with a decent plot but I doubt that McCarthy will be remembered for her performance.\n\nBudget: $29million Worldwide Gross: $79million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their comedies, starring Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Bell, Peter Dinklage, Tyler Labine, Kathy Bates, Margo Martindale, Cecily Strong and Dax Shepard. 4/10"

When wealthy businesswoman Michelle (Melissa McCarthy) is sent to prison for insider trading she is left with nothing except her massive ego. Turning to her former assistant Claire for help, she ingratiated herself into the lives of her and her daughter with a grand plan to become successful once again. Sounds good on paper but this film, although mildly entertaining and fairly easy to watch, did not live up to its promise. As with many comedies, this film tried too hard. We were given all the funny bits in the trailers and what was left was insipid and dreary. There were a few funny moments throughout but mainly the humour was inappropriate to the plot and uncomfortable to watch. It's a shame because it had a strong cast, my favourite being the character of Mike, played by Tyler Labine, who added just the right amount of desperate craziness in his bid to woo and date Claire. Melissa McCarthy was wasted in this role. Glad to have seen it, will not rush to watch it again."

(Bridesmaids) Imo, if you enjoyed The Heat or Tammy especially, with their raunchier humor, you'll love The Boss. I saw it on $5 Tuesday, and would have gladly paid triple the price to see it. It seems like critics hate Melissa, and the public can't handle her adult humor being as we're in the year of the butt-hurt, part 2. My advice is to lighten up. Go into this movie with all your guards down and allow yourself to laugh at everything, whether it's p.c. or not. Laughter is the best medicine. People are getting too serious these days, as well as being too easily offended. This is a rated R comedy. That means rude and crude humor and anything over- the-top to get a laugh. If that's not your thing then by all means avoid this movie. If you find offensive humor funny and want to pee your pants laughing then do yourself a favor and let loose the laughter.

This puts them into conflict with a rival girl scout group and a former bitter rival comes back on the scene Renault (Peter Dinklage) who wishes to destroy her for once and for all.\n\nMcCarthy looks weird with a collection of turtlenecks that makes you think that there is something wrong with her neck. The film should had aimed for some kind of School of Rock vibe but McCarthy constantly curses around the kids, is mean spirited and shows little empathy even though at the beginning we see her as a child rejected by various foster parents. There are some bright moments with some decent knockabout comedy when McCarthy's girl scouts tussle with the rivals but the film is too unfocused and meanders all over the place."

Unless you don't have a sense or humor or hate dirty jokes, than I don't think you might like this movie.\n\nMelissa McCarthy, Peter Drinkalge and Kristen Bell as the lead roles, I think they did a very wonderful job and served super acting, especially from Drinklage. Ignore the other user reviews, they honestly have no sense of humor not to enjoy a film like this.\n\nBig thumbs up for this movie and the actors! Hopefully we would get a sequel one day too."

She really is so versatile. The movie is funny, period. If you're not into raunchy comedies why would you even watch a Melissa McCarthy movie? I think the premise of the flick was pretty believable behind all the jokes. Takes real work to start a business, and it takes real work to work through trauma that makes you build up walls. I love that most Melissa McCarthy movies have some little life lesson in them. Even if they do get wrapped up in \"vulgar\" jokes. I have watches this flick multiple times, and will watch it again."

Melissa McCarthy once again proves she's a comedic powerhouse, delivering a performance that had me laughing from start to finish. The way she embodies her character is simply brilliant, with impeccable timing and a flair for physical comedy that makes every scene a joy to watch.\n\nIf you enjoyed her performances in Spy and The Heat, you'll definitely love her in this giggle-fest. The chemistry between the cast is fantastic, and the witty, sharp script adds layers of humor that keep you engaged throughout. Each supporting character brings their own unique charm to the film, making it an ensemble worth watching.\n\nThe storyline, while lighthearted and fun, also carries a message about resilience and redemption, which adds a bit of depth to the laughter. The movie combines slapstick humor with clever dialogue, resulting in a film that is both entertaining and uplifting.\n\nDon't let the critics sway you-give The Boss a chance, and you'll find yourself in stitches. It's a feel-good movie that's perfect for lifting your spirits and providing a much-needed dose of laughter. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a fun and hilarious comedy!"

This comedy will make you look like an absolute fool in front of others in the cinema - that is, because you will be laughing so hard!

Yes, there are curse words, there are cartoon-sh fights, the unsettling \"children of the corn\" battle. But i think this all together makes a great comedy. I think Hollywood needs to toughen up a little in the sterile and boring world of political correctness. We are not watching \"House on a prairie\" here. I mean, there is nothing wrong with the \"House...\", but this is Melissa McCarthy comedy. Delivered as advertised.\n\nTo be honest, i loved the speech in the beginning. Very empowering. Is that what have scared the male population? And i am not feminist in case you are wondering."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Boss\" is one of those movies that you can only enjoy if you accept low, in-your-face humor. Melissa McCarthy is all about said humor, and her character here is no exception. Part of the movie's aim is to show the contrast between McCarthy's brash, crude-mannered former magnate, and Kristen Bell's uptight former employee, with McCarthy trying to launch a new business and hire Bell. There's no shortage of talk about sexual organs, and McCarthy's abrasive character even upsets a Girl Scouts-like organization. I suspect that they had fun filming it. Even if you think that it gets too over-the-top at times (such as the tanning scene or the plan of what to do with the guard), you gotta love McCarthy's character's outrageousness."

        "review_detailed_main": "Channeling a combination of Lucille Ball and Jerry Lewis, Melissa ushers physical comedy to a whole new level. The movie starts with a little history of Michelle Darnell's troubled childhood, being rejected from family after family. As she grows up, Michelle becomes overly self-reliant, deciding to make it in the world as independently as possible. That independence comes at a cost. Will Michelle grow a conscious or continue her corporate climb, stepping on as many heads needed to make it back to the top? You have to see The Boss to find out!\n\nIt is a hilarious movie watching Michelle Darnell transform from a despicable tyrant to a heart-warming character that you ultimately root for. Kristin Bell plays the Dean Martin straight man to Melissa McCarthy's Jerry Lewis. Peter Dinklage is pure icing on the cake with expertly delivered lines and evolving hairstyle.\n\nThe kids in the movie are the real winners here. Ella and Eva steal every scene they are in, and the West Side Story rumble on the block is half kid Braveheart and half sugar- cookie filled insanity.\n\nIs this a high-brow, erudite comedy? Newp! This is the heart-warming, trash-talking, hair scalping comedy that will keep you in a silly mood for days! If you need a pick-me-up after a long work week, this is the comedy that will have you seeking out brownies, itching for an old-fashioned street fight, and motivate you to finally ask for that raise. Now go see it!"

There was some serious scenes that didn't pan out, but all the goofy scenes hit the spot. McCarthy still can be funny whatever role she plays. From Plainfield IL to Hollywood must not have been easy, but to still be able to pull it off, great.

She and Kristen Bell play off each other with such perfection. Peter Dinklage is also quite the scene stealer, when he is on camera, he goes for the moment each time.

We have crassness, tenderness, brains, and the heroine is hardly a barbie doll. So, what gives? There is subtlety and slapstick, there is suffering and joy. TBH, I cannot figure it out.

        "review_detailed_main": "The Boss, a comedy starring Melissa McCarthy and directed by her husband, Ben Falcone, is the worst kind of bad movie. It is passively bad, switching gears to no discernible purpose and having things happen that don't constitute \"events\" in any meaningful sense. Throughout its last hour, it keeps jumping into your lap and demanding love without doing anything to earn it. This is the worst kind of bad movie. Melissa McCarthy plays a disgraced businesswoman trying to re-invent herself in \"The Boss\". She is a brilliant physical comic, in a particular mode of id-monster, reptilian brain clowning. She is the kind of actor who can crash through a wall spouting gibberish and make you believe that it's something that a person might actually do. She shines when disrupting order, but here she's mostly begging for love. She's the kind of actor who can crash through a wall spouting gibberish and make you believe that it's something that a person might actually do. McCarthy's character in \"The Boss\" is a self-help guru and businesswoman who was raised in an orphanage. The movie drains her of any distinguishing characteristics save poor impulse control and pathological neediness. When the neediness overwhelms everything else, the effect is off-putting and depressing, and there are no compensatory virtues (brilliantly staged slapstick). McCarthy's other star vehicles have had a bit of this \"please love me\" thing, but in general, the less obvious her films go to that well, the more focused and entertaining they are. The Boss is a movie that constantly shifts in tone, with McCarthy's Darnell being a complete dolt in the Will Ferrell/Zach Galifianakis vein, but then snapping back to present her as a business genius and a warm auntie to Claire and Claire's daughter. It is not that The Boss wants to explore the psyche of a capitalist savant, but it is ready, willing and able to ditch all story momentum in pursuit of a cheap joke. The film is sloppily patched together with endless shots of Chicago streetscapes set to bland music. Director Ben Falcone is actually McCarthy's husband, and if they want to continue to collaborate on projects, they should limit themselves to putting on plays in their backyard for friends and family. Darnell is released from prison and ends up in Claire's walk-up apartment. The Boss is going for a Great McGinty-esque redemption story, but it takes 40 minutes for the first scene with any real laughs. Melissa McCarthy's character is obnoxious and bull-in-the-china shop, but she still manages to make her likable. The Boss is trying to create a Great McGinty-esque redemption story, but it takes 40 minutes for the first scene with any real laughs. McCarthy can sell the Bill Murray-esque obnoxious bull-in-the-china shop character and still make her likable, but to watch her flounder with such poor material is humiliating for all involved."
