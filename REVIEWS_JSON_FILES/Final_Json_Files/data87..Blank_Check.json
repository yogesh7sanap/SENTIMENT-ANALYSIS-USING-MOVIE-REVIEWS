This is like a knock-off Home Alone that didn't really understand how the formula works, and it stretches plausibility almost to the breaking point. Also, I get that this is a childhood fantasy story, but the relationship between 11-year-old Preston and 30-year-old Shay borders on creepy. I don't regret watching it again, but I don't think this will make it into our regular family rotation of films."

He attends a little brat's birthday party and after seeing all his big-spending friends and the birthday boy, decides it's time for a change. Now we know his own special day is approaching. His thrifty father provides him with an $11 check, and as he goes down to his local bank to cash it, a recently-released thief named Carl Quigley(played convincingly by Miguel Ferrer) runs over his little bicycle. Eager to avoid the police, Quigley gives the kid a blank check and takes off. The check has fallen into the wrong hands, as Preston fills it in for a cool $1m and what do you know, has no trouble cashing it! Things get worse for the boy after a spending spree, as the money will eventually disappear, and a certain someone will be longing for that fortune.\n\nI enjoyed Brian Bonsall's and Karen Duffy's little friendship, along with friendly limousine driver Rick Ducommun, but the plot is way too basic, and my opinion remains the same now, as it did in 1994, when I first saw the film."

Certain movies - like this one here - just aim at plain and comical nonsense. Such movies can't be rated from the point of view of a hypercritical reviewer. Of course these movies lack quality, lack a sophisticated storyline, very often lack first-class acting, but if they do fulfil their primary premise - that's okay. I don't have this movie here on my list of all-time favorites, but I still thought it was funny, had some very enjoyable sequences and made a good story. Brian Bonsall is a smart actor anyway."

Carl is sending Juice (Tone Loc) the next day to cash a check. Outside the bank, Carl almost runs over Preston with his car and destroys his bike. Carl gives Preston a check but fails to write down an amount as he rushes away before the cops arrive. Preston fills in $1 million. Biderman mistakes Preston for the expected Juice and hands over the money. Preston creates a fake identity Macintosh to buy a mansion, hire chauffeur Henry, woo bank teller Shay Stanley (Karen Duffy) who turns out to be an undercover cop, and throw a big birthday party.\n\nMoney obsession is not necessary a great subject for a kids movie. This could still be fun if Preston has friends. It could be loads of childhood fun. Instead, he's alone and it's terribly sad. The young actor isn't charismatic enough and it's probably expecting too much from him. His fling with Karen Duffy is borderline creepy. The villains are not bumbling enough and Miguel Ferrer is actually quite scary. There is simply a lack of fun in this kids movie."

People Say it's a Ripoff Of Home Alone but it's still enjoyable. The Movie is About a Boy Named Preston Walters (Brain Bonsall) who gets a Blank Check from a Criminal Named Carl Quigley (Miguel Ferrer) who works With a Corrupt Bank Teller Edward Biderman (Michael Lerner) & A Guy Named Juice (Tone Loc) who Biderman was Supposed give the Money to Juice buts gives it instead to Preston. Preston spends all the Money & The Villains try to go after Preston. The Movie has A lot of Pratfalls & Silly Stuff but I liked it enough.

All this changes when a bank robber runs over Preston's bike and passes him a blank check as compensation. Preston uses the check to withdraw $1 million from the bank (ironically, the money belongs to the bank robber who gave him the check). Preston then buys a mansion and says that he's working as the assistant of a mysterious and wealthy backer named Mr. Macintosh (named after his computer). After that, he just goes crazy with the money.\n\nOn paper, this sounds like a great idea. However, on screen, it is one of the emptiest movies I've ever seen. For one thing, it's too unbelievable. I know some parts of the movie were meant to be incredible, but I draw the line at a twelve-year-old boy going out with a thirty-year-old woman, and being put in charge of a imaginary person's small fortune. Also, this was a shallow movie with weak acting, a predictable plot line and characters who are less than memorable. The characters were either cheesy, over the top, annoying, or underdeveloped. But \"Juice\" was a funny character.\n\nIf you're looking for a good movie to watch with your family, skip this one."

For some, that is saying very little, but those who are seeking something that is a child's fantasy, and not particularly taxing on the mind, will always have this movie to consider.\n\nThere are numerous details of the story that I could go into to further argue the point that it is innocent, and simple fun, but to do so would be to ruin any enjoyment that this movie has to offer, because this movie is without a doubt not something you would want to watch repeatedly. I have seen this movie exactly twice, and that was enough for me. Would I watch it if it were playing? More than likely, but this is a movie that just gets old fast due to its meaninglessness."

At the end, when the boy has to let go of his money and his crimes, they agree to date when he is older, and she kisses the little boy passioniately on the lips.\n\nThis movie would not exist if it was a grown man kissing a little girl the same way.\n\nAnd to think that this Disney movie was released in 1994, the same year as The Lion King, The Return of Jafar, Angels In The Outfield, and The Santa Clause.\n\nSo, if you want to see a cross between Catch Me If You Can and Lolita from the House of Mouse, or a dumb movie to laugh at (not with), then this is the movie you need to see.

Basically, an 11 year old who is bullied because he has very little money is given a blank check by a moronic criminal. Of course, the 11 year old happens to possess enough technology and intelligence to purchase a house, cash a check for 1,000,000 dollars, and even foil three bumbling idiots, reminiscent of the three stooges.\n\nPreston Blake is an annoying, obnoxious, boy, who decides that, when written a blank check by a complete stranger, he will take advantage of the situation as best as he can. In other words, he wanders into a bank,\n\nhands a teller a check he makes in his printer, and miraculously walks out with a million bucks in cash. Preston is also apparently capable of reaching incredible speeds on his bicycle, due to the fact that a man driving a Jaguar after Preston and his 10-speed could not catch him, even when Preston jumped a row of cars.\n\nOf course, with every hokey adventure movie, there has to be hot heroine. In this case our hot heroine is a child molesting FBI agent who dates the eleven year old Preston, and promises another date when he turns 17.\n\nHowever, the absolute worst aspect of this film was not its casting, nor its sloppy dialog, such as \"The only other way I could think of skinning a cat is to stick a hose up it's butt and then pick up the fur\". It was, rather, the entire fact that nobody in the entire film seemed to realize that the FBI does not give a damn about random people . What I have failed to explain is that Preston uses the alias \"Macintosh\" to masquerade as an entrepreneur of sorts. Of course, the FBI finds this intriguing and sends our young heroine after Preston, who uses his 11-year old wit to first scream when lobsters fall on his face, then treat her to hamburgers, finishing with a ridiculous romp through a cemented area where water jettison's from the ground. Our heroine fails to realize during this whole adventure that the criminal the FBI is pursuing is slipping and sliding right behind the two, as they make their way to Preston's limousine, complete with a 1-dimensional driver who never fails to provide cheap, 3rd rate laughs that the whole family can choke on.\n\nOverall: 1/10 is incredibly gracious for this film. I don't see how it only has a 4.4/10."

The jokes are not funny, the main \"protagonist\", Preston is a little brat that has no idea on how economics really work and who's idea was it to have a romantic subplot with a 12-year-old little boy and a 20-something year-old FBI agent?! That was just stupid. The only thing that's good about this movie is Tone Loc's performance, but other than that....all of the character are freaking' idiots and the father is complete douche-bag.\n\nBottom line, do not bother showing your kids this movie. It will send them the wrong message!"

Even Miguel Ferrer the voice actor of Shan Yu (Mulan) and Death (Adventure Time) had to be in this abomination.

        "review_title": "\"Blank Check\"- The pangs of nostalgia for a childhood favorite are overcome by a general sense of apathy and sometimes unease while revisiting this 90's family film.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Don'tcha just love nostalgia? Those warm, fuzzy and oft-forlorn feelings for days long since past. The yearning to revisit childhood favorites and return to a simpler, easier time. Everyone has those things from their past that bring back the memories and the magic. For many in my generation, it's all about the 90's- a peculiar time period indeed and a blur of experimentation and transition in the world of entertainment that supplied some classics... but also many duds.\n\nOne film in particular is most certainly a bi-product of this odd period in time- the 1994 Disney release \"Blank Check.\" It's a film that celebrates the excessive desires we all have as children, and for many of us watching it back in the day, it was the ultimate power-trip. A film that revolved around what any kid would do if they suddenly came across a million dollars. And we loved it! We loved seeing a child suddenly given near-limitless power, able to buy all the toys and video-games and play-things he wanted. It was pure magic.\n\nBut at the same time, our parents would collectively roll their eyes, shake their heads and scoff at the complete and utter lack of realism and consequence presented. But we didn't care... what did they know?! They're not kids! They're stinky old adults! They just didn't understand the movie like we did! And we knew we'd treasure this film until the end of time! ...well, until we grew up ourselves, that is. Yes, it's a bit of a sad thing to admit, but these sorts of childhood power-fantasy favorites just don't hold up when you revisit them as adults. We enjoyed \"Blank Check\" at the time because it was tailor made for the 6-12 age demographic. But that enjoyment is wholly replaced by a general sense of apathy and sometimes even startling unease when going back and revisiting it as we enter our late 20's and early 30's. We start to see why our parents scoffed and rolled their eyes... because often, these types of films aren't nearly as good as we think they are.\n\n12-year-old Preston (Brian Bonsall) just can't catch a break. His family is incredibly frugal. He can't afford to do fun things with his friends. And he is bullied by other kids. All that changes when he is given a blank check one day after a man accidentally runs over his bike. Preston tries to capitalize on the opportunity by filling the check out for a million dollars, not realizing that the man who crushed his bike (Miguel Ferrer) is actually a career criminal! A seedy bank official actually gives Preston the money, assuming he's being used as a middle-man for cover. Now, Preston has a million dollars cash to use any way he wants- toys, games, you name it! But the men he stole it from might just come looking to get it back...\n\nThe failure of \"Blank Check\" boils down to two huge fundamental issues I have with the story and execution of the film. That being the troubled and uneven storytelling on the part of director Rupert Wainwright and a frankly eerie and even disturbing tonality and focus that is impossible to ignore as an adult. The film is a complete and utter mess too often, to the point of distraction. Director Wainwright takes a simple enough premise but can't find an appropriate and consistent sense of pacing, composition or flow, leading to a frenzied and sometimes hackneyed final product that alternates between being filmed like a low-key police procedural and an Adrenalin-pumping music video. It's difficult to watch or let yourself get pulled in because it's completely scatter-brained, and the wonky storytelling also makes the many holes and gaps in logic in the script feel glaring and blatant. Wainwright also seems far too committed to making the film appealing to kids first and foremost, but it's to the detriment of the work. Too often he throws in kitschy camera angles and sped-up footage to emulate cartoons, and has the camera focus on comedic- relief characters (including a woefully unfunny Rick Ducommun who hams it up in the worst of ways) to the point it becomes transparent pandering. It's poor work, and a glaring example of how not to make a kids film. It feels like it's talking down to the viewers... not having fun with him.\n\nAnd then there's the creepy bits. Oh, boy... this film is not appropriate in the slightest. And I'm not talking about violence or profanity. I'm talking about tone and focus. This movie is a complete and utter nightmare to behold as an adult. From the presentation of our \"hero\" as a glorified thief who gets away with basically everything and faces little consequences until the final act (which I will not spoil), to making all of the adult characters the types of people kids will not respect, to a truly disgusting \"love story\"... this is not a good movie to show to young children. When I say \"creepy bits\", I'm not talking about potentially frightening scenes for children. I'm talking about incredibly uncomfortable scenes to watch for adults, including a prolonged subplot in which 12-year-old Preston goes on \"dates\" with the adult woman (the admittedly very sexy Karen Duffy) handling the finances, who openly seems to be \"flirting\" with a child. It's supposed to be played for \"Aww, adorable!\" moments... but the execution is just incredibly cringe-worthy and leaves you feeling unclean. As do the many moments where Preston openly manipulates, lies to and harasses people for his own amusement. It makes the film and the characters impossible to like.\n\n\"Blank Check\" might benefit from a fun premise and a strong central performance thanks to its talented child-star. But it's an ugly film with a mean-streak, morally questionable moments that adults will find worrying and sub-par storytelling. It's not the film you remember it being. And I give it a very sub-par 3 out of 10."

Granted, these are very unrealistic situations, but I do think that if parents discussed these issues with their children, maybe they should watch this video as well, in order to show/scare their kids that lies have the potential to get you hurt."

Tone Loc gives a raucous performance as Juice, the middle man in the money laundering scheme. Miguel Ferrer plays the actual crook, who ends up taking on the alias of Mr. McIntosh and Michael Lerner is the bank manager handling the scheme.\n\nIn recent years, there has been controversy surrounding this film and the kiss that Shea gives to Preston.

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of my favorite movies. I've heard this movie being compared to Home Alone. If you look at the movie cover, you'll see how it says, \"If You Loved Home Alone, You'll Love Blank Check.\" I've noticed many similar scenes to both Home Alone and Home Alone 2 as both movies were out by the time this movie was made. It is possible that the people who wrote and worked on this movie, came up with a lot of their ideas from Home Alone and tried to make a Disney Friendly slapstick humor of Home Alone with what a kid would do with $1 Million. I personally like this movie better than Home Alone. I feel like it has a lot more of a plot to it. In this movie, Preston tells his parents about wanting his own house, his own rules, his own money. While that might seem like a kid's dream he ends up being able to get $1 million. Some of the things that make this movie great. For one, watching this movie will take you back to the '90s. A lot of people from my Millennial Generation, old enough to remember the '90s miss those times considering life to have been really good back then. They try to remember life and entertainment back then. This movie shows an old computer in Preston's room. It also shows how rather than Preston buying things online like you would now, he just looks numbers up to call from a phone book. It shows some old arcade games and Preston having many TVs turned into his own virtual entertainment system. Something that still is incredible years later. It also shows '90s things like you see a lot of TVs that aren't flat screen. Also, one time I watched this with a friend my same age during the scene where we see Preston in the store riding a bike playing with the things inside the store. My friend told me he remembers when you used to be able to try things like that out at a store. I can't remember doing that as a kid. This movie entertains you showing all the things Preston bought. We see how a kid would spend all that money, he gets chased by the bad guys in this movie. We also see a lot of Preston's community in Indiana. Things like his neighborhood, a typical looking neighborhood with a castle house across the street, a really big bank in his town close enough that Preston rides his bike to, an amusement park, a water park, a public park (during the chase scene), Lots of really nice stores, businesses including Preston going to Tangerino's on a date. Also, one of the more memorable scenes from the movie where Preston and Shay dance in these fountains we all wonder where those fountains are. So, this movie is also better than Home Alone as we're more familiar with Preston's community than Kevin's in the first Home Alone. Also, a whole community of people are curious about who Mr. Macintosh is, not ever meeting him only hearing Preston saying he works for him. People gullible enough to buy things from a kid, and believe a kid who claims he works for somebody they've never met. All this action takes place in like only a week time. So this movie has great music, it's fast paced, and it's funny. This movie will end leaving us with a couple of unanswered questions we're all curious about. They haven't made a sequel for this movie, or even an explanation as to what would end up happening later. Preston's the main character so he's a character we like. But, we ask ourselves even if he mostly seems like a good kid other than a little bratty and selfish. But, seriously I'm sure people would eventually discover including Shay that Preston was behind all that spending and that fake character, Mr. Macintosh. He might even confess it to his parents as he said as the movie was ending about Mr. Macintosh how he shouldn't have fooled everybody and told his Dad that he'd tell him all about Mr. Macintosh the next day. So, did Preston confess to his parents about being behind the whole Mr. Macintosh thing, and how would his parents feel if they found out Preston got $1 Million and bought a house? So, we wonder if Preston as a kid would have been arrested or eventually arrested if the police found out? How much trouble would this get him into? We also wonder what would happen with all the stuff Preston bought? The people in the movie, especially the ones that would clear out the house should figure that a grown man would not want to buy all that kid stuff. That is stuff a kid would buy. The final question is does Preston ever get together with Shay? Disney did not consider it inappropriate to show like an 11/12 year old kid in love with a 30 year old woman, going on a date with her, and kissing her. I wonder if Disney could get away with that now? But, while they did agree to see each other when Preston was older, they said 6 years and as this movie takes place in 1993 that would mean they were supposed to see each other in 1999. How about now, over 20 years later? Did they eventually reunite and fall in love? It should not have taken long after the movie ended for Shay to have discovered that Preston was behind all that spending and Mr. Macintosh. But, she liked him enough and was a gentle person. I'm sure she'd forgive him and not take it too seriously. Overall, I'd give this movie a 10/10 as it's always an empowering movie for me to watch. I think most kids even kids of today would enjoy this movie."

What really helps this film is it has a good cast of actors. Now overall, they are B list actors, but overall good character actors nonetheless. The story is centered around the main character who is 11 years old, and it's his birthday. He is upset that his grandmother sends him a blank check. He goes to cash it and ends up with a check for a million dollars. But the money and check belongs to a local gangster- who wants his money back. After that, he goes after the kid and the adventure goes from there! This is a fun and good story!"
