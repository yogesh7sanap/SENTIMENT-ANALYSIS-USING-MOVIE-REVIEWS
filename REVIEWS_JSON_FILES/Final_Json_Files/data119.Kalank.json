Direction wise the movie is really bad, probably one of the worst direction of all time.No plot.No character Development. Only Melodrama. Director is wannabe SanjayLeelaBansari. Music is forgettable and Pritam's worst movie as music director. Like other review says, the film is extremely boring."

The roles of Madhuri, Varun and Alia are highly highly commendable..My big appreciation and admiration to such stars who played the characters soo well and put life in them as real..\n\nThe cinematography was also very amazing.\n\nWill definitely watch this film again once it comes to Amazon Prime!"

Looking ravishing, beautiful and delicate from start till the end, all thanks to her amazing costumes, make-up and poise! Rest, all are manageable! Nothing extraordinary!\n\nProduction design has done wonderful job at creating a complete city from scratch! Costumes are fabulous! Especially Alia and Aditya's costumes are worth a mention!\n\nBad: Music is very average, never works in favor of the film! At times, it breaks the continuity of the film too. Like all are sobbing and abruptly Kriti Sanon barges in with Saiyya Mera with zero expressions and lame dance moves, the city is on fire, relationships are getting tested and Madhuri can't stop dancing on Tabah Ho Gaye etc). Even, the only manageable song \"Kalank\" gets wasted and poorly utilized and no emotions gets translated to the audience!\n\nOverall writing is too bad, being set in Year 1945 won't give you a licence to tell a lame and lazy story!!!\n\nDialogues which would have been the strength of this kind of \"Period Drama\" are so bland! I can still enjoy \"SLB's Devdas\" for that fact!\n\nYou can get the lame \"references\" from other hit films like HDDCS Aishwarya's entry Patang Wala Song - Alia Entry Song, HDDCS Aishwarya's Look - Alia Look, HDDCS Salman-Ajay getting drunk, talking about their love, singing Dholi Taro- Varun - Aditya scene, even HDDCS Chandelier (Jhumaar) reappeared here, DDLJ's train climax - yes, it was hanging here too, and many more....)\n\nStrictly any emotion get conveyed to the audience! I had no emotional connect at all, neither in the start, nor in the end! I can feel no pain of what these characters are going through I was just waiting it to be over!\n\nLength is 2Hours 48 Minutes long! Be prepared, as it feels a decade inside the theater!\n\nAnd yes, the story is so predictable that you can guess that in the start only, I got it right after only 8 Mins into the film, literally, 8 mins!!!\n\nAll in all, paisa Bachao, Avengers Endgame Dekho next week! Baaki sab first class hai"

The songs are fantastic. It looks and sounds brilliant. 10/10 in that regard. It's just the story doesn't really hook you until near the end. I feel the acting was quite good overall but the standouts were definitely Varun Dhawan and Madhuri. It ends on a good note which makes the whole experience worth it for me.

What kept me hooked was everyone's acting as well as the sets, costumes, and cinematography. The songs were good too. The climax was surprising with a lot of emotions. Alia was superb and Varun did a pretty damn good job. Aditya and Sonakshi stood out too. I appreciated Sanjay Dutt for his efforts as well. But most importantly, Madhuri was just breathtaking! People are not giving credit to where it's due and are bashing the entire movie. It's not that bad!"

First of all when you merge the film with history, one has to show at least the history as real, you can amend the future, hence Sci Fi. There are no mountains near lahore for miles and bull fighting, in Indo-Pak, which wrong history books have the writer read. Then it was Alia Bhatt and Varun in the movie and their God father Karan producer so there are expensive sets, expensive clothes and expensive everything but anything near to a sane movie. Sanjay Dutt was credit as Special Appearance but he is having more screen time then Sonakshi sinha. Madhuri, well there was and there will be only one Devdas and one chandramukhi, a fail attempt to recreate that magic. Alia entry song over inspired again from Sanjay Bhansali movie hum dil chuke sanam picturized on Aishwarya Rai. Dont watch it at all"

Please, we want substance, not a soulless opera masquerading as a magnum opus.\n\nSeriously want a REFUND - for the tickets and for the coffee (even the extra shot of espresso didn't help revive my dying brain cells) I had to buy during interval to suffer through the second half. Karan Johar has clearly lost it but I'm mad at myself for not waiting until the reviews were out.

Watching paint drying or drinking your Nana's bath water is more enjoyable than watching this movie. All this movie has is huge eye-catching sets and good costume design, rest all is dud. It's still mind boggling to see these producers and directors think just having huge sets, big budget and a huge star cast makes a hit film. Making fun of marriage and testing it's boundaries which many consider holy is not new to Dharma production, but when you want to test the boundaries at least tie it with good story line where it feels like a literature and not a regurgitation of crap that the producer swallows from a leather funnel."

But the girl (Alia Bhatt) won't agree to wait till the first wife dies and says she'll enter the house only as the second wife. But she soon finds herself lonely and unloved as her new husband (Aditya Roy Kapur) loves his first wife only and says so. He's obviously into mature women and not wispy young girls. And the wispy young girl is not into serious, intellectual men. Left to herself, she falls for a young blacksmith (Varun Dhavan). It is soon revealed that the two men share the same father (Sanjay Dutt). One is his illegitimate son by a brothel keeper (Madhuri Dixit). The other is the highly educated editor of the local newspaper. After all this is established, the film drags slowly to a fairly predictable resolution. The sets are unrealistically opulent, with the brothel resembling a five star heritage resort and the rich man's house resembling the White House. Kalank is part of a now established genre in Bollywood, which includes films like Vidhu Vinod Chopra's Eklavya: The Royal Guard."

It was very grandeur. And the acting by everyone was really well done. I didn't expect Varun to be so good but he was. Everyone was. Now the story isn't the best out there but it's not terrible. It made logical sense but there were some choices that I disagree with especially in the end. It is a slow paced movie but I was intrigued all throughout. I felt the movie was more about the people than the partition and it was a side thought even tho it's supposed to be a love story during the partition. The partition only came to center stage when a conflict needed to arise. The story could've been better. But go watch it for the direction and the imagery on screen and the amazing songs. Arijit and Sherya killed it like always. I give it a solid 7/10."

Kalank create such moments many times. One can visit the set of this movie on their mind while watching this.\n\nAbhishek Barman may not be still on the position of Sanjay Leela Bhansali but the effort he made is great. Varun Dhawan's as always same body language but he stole the show. Alia Bhatt never failed to amaze and finally Aditya Roy Kapoor after a long time did something promising.\n\nThe movie can get boring at moments but you need to be a film lover to watch this movie. Because in Bollywood we hardly get good techniques in movies. And Kalank is one of those. Where everything was near good, but Kalank failed to reach average film watcher because lack of salt on everywhere."

The history of India takes an epic turn, from where there is no coming back.\n\nAs the name suggests, Kalank is a story that questions the high morals of society, especially when it comes to love and family ties.\n\nThe film focuses on how eternal love goes beyond the norms and rules of society, the trappings of religions, and all other physical and man-made boundaries.\n\nAt a dramatic moment in the film, Aditya Roy Kapur's Dev remarks that if someone's wife is in love with another man, then what is the point of the marriage at all.\n\nThe story is based in a town called Husnabad near Lahore, a few years before the Partition of India and Pakistan. It's a town populated by blacksmiths and a majority of them are Muslims.\n\nDev and his father Balraj (Sanjay Dutt), who also run a liberal newspaper called The Daily News. Dev's life takes an sudden turn when under strange circumstances he gets married to Roop.\n\nRoop meets Zafar, the local blacksmith and they fell in love, The story is predictable.\n\nWhat's fresh about Kalank is the sets, the costumes, everything about the film.\n\nThe other high points of the film are the problematic equation between father and son, Dev and Balraj as well as the fragile teacher-student dynamic between Bahaar Begum and Roop. But all thiiz are presented in very bored manner. \ud83d\ude10\n\nAn epic love saga \ud83d\ude44based during the 1940s ,,is too away from reality. (Like Movie Saawariya 2007)\n\nMusic by Pritam is good, performances of all actors are intense.\n\nAt 2 hours and 48 minutes, with a tighter edit the story could have wrapped up much sooner though.\n\nMovie makes u feel bored at times,,Characters are strange and looks serious always unnecessarily.\n\nFunny points are as follows:\n\n1. Madhuri lives in a palace and one has to travel by boat to reach her.\n\n2. Bull fight is funny. Bull is intelligent and returns back when crowd thinks it is over.\n\n3. Kuch rishte karzon ker tarah hote hain unhe nibhana nahi chukana padta hai. Key dialogue of movie.\n\n4. A lot of extra in dances but only two person in the funeral of sonakshi. Why..none knows..!\n\n5. Siddhart Roy Kapoor : Ajay Devgan from HDDCS\n\n6. Varun : SRK from Devdas\n\n7. Sanjay Dutt : BigB from KANK\n\n8. Madhuri : Madhuri from Devdas\n\n9. Alia : Aishwarya from HDDCS\n\n10. Sonakshi: New character\n\nThis time Karan Johar dsnt excel.\n\nRatings: 5/10 for big starcast, music & production values..!!"

This movie keep on drag for nearly 3 hour, which made climax dull (easily predicted from trailer/song already). It could have easily been an hour less and be more entertaining. There was nothing novelty in this movie. It is just disappointing and OVERPRICED TOO. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR AVENGERS...SKIP IT."

The actors have acted well, the songs are great and the sets are amazing. The sets actually left me in aw.

Her husband Dev Chaudhary (Aditya Roy Kapoor) runs a newspaper that propagates the theory of \"one nation\" that attracts the ire of the majority Muslim population of Husnabad, further complicating matters. Throw in the twist of Zafar having a sinister other agenda of vendetta regarding his lineage, Kalank assumes a complex labyrinthine plot that you know must end in a tragedy, albeit unpredictable.\n\nI know that the aforesaid appears riveting but in reality the story actually is rather shallow to be stretched for 166 minutes. Laboriously slow, this is yet another case of form overtaking the content where the objective appears to be one of a demonstration of opulence and grandeur in everything and the story playing a mere second fiddle to gloss. Unfortunately the sets appear artificial and unconvincing and the characters aren't allowed to achieve significance, other than the lead pair. Aditya Roy Kapoor is wooden as usual, Sonakshi Sinha has precious little to do, Sanjay Dutt and Madhuri Dixit could have gotten meatier presence, but the director Abhishek Varman remains besotted with Varun and Alia only, making the experience rather monotonous. The climax where the train to Amritsar virtually strolls out of the station is so prolonged that one could steal a couple of winks in between.\n\nHaving said the above, Kalank makes for an experiential watching for several reasons - both Varun and Alia are outstanding in what they do, the grandeur is indeed spellbinding, Madhuri is grace personified and Pritam's music is ace. \"Kalank nahin ishq hai kaajal piya\" is a haunting melody that refuses to leave you, and \"Ghar more pardesiya\" is art sublime, in every form."

        "review_detailed_main": "Everyone is being too harsh on this movie. Movies are art and not about achieving 100 crores club (unless you've personally invested in the movie!?).\n\nDon't compare Kalank with a masterpiece from Sanjay Leela Bhansali for a start. 4 of the 6 leads are not mature actors and are still on their journeys. They will develop over time for such movies and Varun, Alia, Aditiya and Sonakshi have done what the makers asked of them. Madhuri is amazing ...acts her age, looks beautiful and dances like a dream. Love her in tabaah ho gaye song. Deserves credit. Sanjay dutt again does what he's been asked to do. His character flaw is that he is a stubborn man who doesn't know how to express love or fix his mistakes. So that's how and why he acts expressionless.\n\nThe film could have cut out the Alia song at the start plus the Kiriti song...if people have such an issue with the length of the movie. The bull scene and 2 others I can recall (car drive & carriage at the end of the movie) had poor special effects for such a big movie.\n\nThe title track is so beautiful. I think it could have been used much better.\n\nThe ladies outfits are beautiful. Aditya looked great. Even Sanjay Dutt looks good.\n\nI rate this movie 3/5 6/10. It's not awful. Had some nice moments. There are some strange moments in the script and direction that I didn't like. I think some of the characters would have taken different actions too in some scenes.\n\nThe story didn't make me feel happy or sad. Didn't make me hold back tears. The box has been ticked. That's something for what feels like an experiment movie from Karan J. Go watch it to simply sit back and take in the scenery. Not every movie will leave you thinking wow and it'll make you re-appreciate the ones that really do ; )"

        "review_title": "Little India Directory Review: Kalank (3 Stars)",
        "review_detailed_main": "The interesting thing about Abhishek Varman's Kalank (Blemish) is that it introduces almost all its characters in the initial minutes and then starts narrating the story, an ambitious period drama that asks its viewers to judge its moral at the end. Unfortunately, that is one of the few interesting elements in this otherwise nondescript tale of love and partition.\n\nSet in just a few months before the Partition of India, Kalank tells the story of a young woman (Alia Bhatt) coaxed into marrying the husband (Aditya Roy Kapoor) of her dying friend (Sonakshi Sinha). Tied into this unwanted union to show her loyalty to her friend, this woman now questions the status quo of a nearby place that has a potential for conflict, a communal one, with the help of her husband's newspaper press (another interesting element). And in her exploration is where she finds a calling for her talent in perhaps the most popular dancer-for-hire (Madhuri Dixit) in the locality as well as a ray of hope in her chained life in a womanizing blacksmith-cum-daredevil (Varun Dhawan). No prizes for guessing what happens to some of these characters because Varman seems confused with writer Shibani Bathija's story as he weaves and explores the relationships between these characters with an unusual degree of unpreparedness. In a way, it surprised me that there is some uncomfortable storytelling happening here, sampling characters that are not too far from realism. But then come the hidden messages and twists that rob the fun out of this drama that is only good at displaying its grand budgetary wealth.\n\nTrying to make sense of the plot and why the characters do what they do, especially in the second act, is what turns Kalank into a tedious affair. Its transition from a romantic drama, struggling to disseminate the sounds of the aching hearts of its characters, into a retelling of the disastrous butchering of the Indian state, with communal rioting as the highlight, further dislodges the film's construction. There is no closure between these transitions and characters seem to act without preamble to keep their audience guessing, which becomes tiring for them especially after having witnessed heavy sequences of singing and dancing that are visually extravagant yet sometimes detached from the plot. There is also a dance sequence involving Dixit in the second half which I think was made solely for the purpose of highlighting the actor's dancing chops and nothing more. And to make it classic Bollywood, Kalank also has an item dance towards the end, which just adds into the many reasons for a lot of people to skip the rest of the film.\n\nHowever, Kalank does stand high in departments that would see it win come awards season: the dialogues, the production setup, and the costumes. It is evident, if it was not already from the marketing, that Kalank has put all the resources into making its characters look like advanced versions of the people living in that period. If you like looking at attractive people wearing glitzy ornaments and threads, Kalank will be more than worth the money you spend on the ticket. Add to that the lavish production design, which makes me want to go back in time despite the circumstances, and the film manages to attract and entertain the doe-eyed viewer who is in the hall to take in the grandeur and nothing else. Unfortunately, all this display does stand out like a sore thumb. Not that I am a historian, but I strongly believe there have been anachronistic slips in these exotic, ethnic costumes worn by the characters throughout the film, even as they jump and dance in background adorned by some good CGI that couldn't really be extended to scenes where it was needed the most. The film is also terribly too long, which gives me ample reasons to complain about.\n\nThe chemistry between the characters is surprisingly effervescent, largely because of the heavy, shiny dialogues written by Hussain Dalal. There is a lot of philosophical talk in here, that might enthuse some people in the audience, but then again it is overkill when characters speak beyond their assumed intellect level. Everyone in Kalank tries to set a precedent and that is probably its biggest issue.\n\nThe cast performances are tried at best. Kunal Khemu, thanks to his well-written character, stands out as he plays an acquaintance to Dhawan's. Bhatt is sweet-looking yet fumbles a little towards the end to maintain her character that is made up of multiple layers. The shuffling between her fierce and submissive traits is lost both because of Varman's direction and Bhatt's unenthusiastic air, which she shares with Sanjay Dutt (who 100% does not want to belong here). I am not impressed by Kapoor's performance either as he fails to move multiple muscles of his face on a single try. His interactions with Sinha's character are ridiculously inorganic, almost making me head for the exit. But Sinha manages to keep the decorum of these scenes as she struggles to play a woman affected by cancer. Dhawan has the meatiest role in Kalank and his efforts (read chiseled body) are very clear both when he courageously gets into a ring with a bull to play a harmless matador and seduces every woman in the locality including Kiara Advani's laughable character. Dixit has this much screen space.\n\nThere are plenty of things wrong with Kalank, starting from the tepid writing to a lack of clarity in the proceedings. As mentioned before, all of its characters want to come first in this race conducted by Varman who forgot to add soul into this beautiful-looking, tasteless recipe. It is ambitious yet uninspiring, grand yet hollow, and unworthy of your attention save for a view or two of its dance sequences. TN.\n\nOriginally appeared in the Little India Directory (Singapore)."

        "review_detailed_main": "Never understood till now that if the makers of a film are willing to spend humongous amount on the production values including grandiose sets, expensive costumes and locations, why can they can't spent more time and effort on the content of the film. I am going to write a story on a fantasy world which can be used to put you in a sleeping mode.\n\nSet in 1944, Kalank tells the story of a blaclsmith, Zafar ( Varun Dhawan) who wants to avenge the rejection by his father, Balraj Chaudhary (Sanjay Dutt), by marrying Roop (#AliaBhatt), second wife to Balraj's legal son, Dev (Aditya Roy Kapur). Inspite of his mother, Bahar Begum (Madhuri Dixit), not supporting him, Zafar hatches the plan.\n\nDirected by Abhishek Verman, who made the disappointing 2 States, Kalank is even worst than that. The film opens with some colorful song (will remind you of the opening sequence of Aishwarya Rai from Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam) and then slowly each characters comes into the picture. You can only breathe for first 30 mins and then the suffocation begins. Believe me, even if you walk out of theater or scroll through social media on your mobile, you will not miss anything as the film hardly moves. The story is similar to any melodrama you watch on TV and the screenplay (also written by Verman) is traumatic. There is Gladiator like battle scene between Varun Dhawan and a raging bull a poor CGI and horrible action scenes. The story by Shibani Bathija is as confusing as the plot while the editing is poor with film length touching 169 minutes long. Music is passable with \"Pardesia\" being pick from a lot.\n\nThe silver lining is the visual appeal the film carries. Sets are indeed gorgeous and full marks should be given to Binod Pradhan. I liked the climax scene which was shot at the background of the Partition riots. The performances by the actors have been fine, especially Varun Dhawan who emotes through his eye brilliantly. Alia Bhatt does well but gets limited due to lack of strong character. Aditya Roy Kapur is good while Madhuri Dixit, Sanjay Dutt and Sonkashi Sinha does not get much scope.\n\nOn the whole, Kalank is a perfect medicine to make you fall asleep."

Good actors like Madhuri, Sonakshi & Sanjay Dutt are wasted. Idiotic bull fight and useless item numbers and unwanted scenes make the movie slow and dragging.

Despite having such an amazing cast it failed to meet my expectations. If I would have to talk about the music I would say that most of the songs were really good. Remo d souza done a really good job at choreographing the songs. The film at the beginning is extremely boring. I honestly think I slept through the first 35 minutes of the film. I think what would have changed the experience for me is if Sanjay Leela Bhansari directed the film. There were some scenes in the film which was stupid to add. Overall , I think the story line could have been a lot more better."

As for this movie it was beautiful, the pace was slow, but the cinematography and acting were great.

The dialogues are reminiscent of the good old times when Urdu and Hindi were spoken; yet, not one of them delivers a punch. It was a delight to see Kunal Khemu after so long. He does justice to his role. Unfortunately the same can't be said about the script which does no justice to his character. The computer graphics in the bull scene lacked finesse - Bahubali 2 had a realistic bull scene, though it was made two years ago. The music was pretty forgettable.

One can make an oscar winning film with a mobile phone camera. So putting in big money and starcast won't bring you money and applause back..\n\nAnd the biggest flaw i saw or heard in the movie is the Background music.. It was a worst imitation of Titanic..! The composer copied the notes and tried to imitate the same score, but it was Horrendous to hear..

No semblance of history, no semblance of geography , and they even have the weather all wrong . And the locales move from desert to snow capped Himalaya to a Ladakh type place to a horrendous set supposed to look like the bazaars of Lahore . The lead actors sit in a fake car and fake horse carriage where they have zero body movements , and everyone is always colour coordinated.\n\nVarun Dhawan is a man who makes swords for a living in Lahore who suddenly becomes a matador in a gladiator type scene. Yes, the bull is fake too.\n\nAlia is a village belle in Ghaghra choli in one scene who is suddenly wearing shararas after she gets married and is a \"highly educated woman \" in another scene.\n\nMadhuri sleepwalks in her scenes like she's waiting for the director to say \"cut\"\n\nAditya looks like a wooden doll with facial hair and no expressions.\n\nAchint Kaur is a woman who nobody knows who she is but she is the only one who knows what's happening in everyone's lives , alas she is killed.\n\nSonakshi seems happy to be bumped off midway during the film, at least her character is spared the insanity.\n\nAnd the Madhuri Alia duet has the same playback singer singing for both ... and Madhuri saying \"timhare awaz mein namak ki kami hai\"\n\nVarun and Aditya's lakeside scene looks like the ghats of Ujjain or Banaras where the two men discuss how many women they have slept with . Ughhhhh\n\nAnd the movie ends with the ghosts of Sonakshi and Madhuri miraculously appearing like Banquo's ghost, only these two ghosts wear white designer shararas.\n\nI want to know what the filmmaker Abhishek Varman was smoking during making this film.\n\n#beyondbizarre"

        "review_detailed_main": "Watched it in theaters finally and it's not as BAD as it is made out to be. Surely, the minuses for me are the same - length, hardly any story, only costume designs and huge sets on display. The film's mediocre considering the budget however, what saves the film to a major extent are the performances. I'm no Varun Dhawan fan but would still say he has done a nice job. He has intensity in his eyes and revenge on his mind. His character has layers but they all crumble in the second half. Alia looks beautiful, but here she is not Impressive as her role does not allow her to show histrionics. It's all there but doesn't come out totally. Aditya Roy Kapur is fine but his character runs on one single narrative. Sanjay Dutt, despite a short role looks convincing in his part but he doesn't have much to do. You could expect the makers to show his weakness, motivations, guiltyness but that doesn't happen. He's a talented actor and they wasted it totally. Ditto for Madhuri Dixit, its a pleasure to see her onscreen and her character has a lot in herself like pain and anguish but again, it's all inside..nothing surfaces on the screen which is why you feel cheated and disappointed.\n\nBut the biggest problem in this film is lack of Romance. Varun's character has been shown a casanova but once he falls in love there's hardly any romance. It does blossom but does not reach a conclusion. The same story we might have witnessed in so many movies earlier. The Audiences have become smarter and Impatient.\n\nAnyways the plusses of the film are music, some dramatic moments and the climax. Its a one time watch but you don't need to go to a theater and buy ticket for it. Can be enjoyed on digital. But it's a lesson for the filmmakers out there to not compromise with the content any longer"

The story moves in twenty different directions with the only common thing being the bond of love between different characters. Character development is poor and you don't understand most of their motivation as well as you should. Unnecessary songs just add to the woes of the audience. Sonakshi and Madhuri are the only ones who feel like they are playing their patts naturally. The rest of them even with their great acting/emoting skills fail to pack a punch when it comes to dialogur delivery. It feels like you are watching a school play at times. Kunal Khemu is the saviour in this mess with his natural portrayal. All in all, forward the songs and watch this movie for the visuals. The most bizarre and silly sequence is one that involves a bull fight. It adds nothing to the narrative and I couldn't understand why it was put in."

This review is not about this particular film only but about the status of films those are being made by so called big film makers and banners of Bollywood. They are making disgusting films which should not be called films at the very first place. Today when we have option to see Hollywood, Netflix, Japanese, Irish, South Indian, Regional Indian films with great stories and approach, why do we need to see such soulless films which are nothing but a pain. Guys! Follow you instincts and start avoiding such nonsense, masala, films. They can never feed your soul. And please stop going to theatres for them. In fact go for those films which are not being able to get their money back just because we didn't watch them despite of having great stories and emotions in them. Until and unless you won't stop watching these films, until and unless you'll help these losers gaining back their money spent on useless scripts and teams, they will keep making such pathetic films and you'll keep getting suffered.

What a crappy plot. And besides a beautiful set there is nothing much to watch in the movie. You will desperately wait for this boring drama to finish whole of the time you are in theater. This movie is new low baseline for me.\n\nThe 2 stars are for the beautiful set used."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a positive review of the 2019 movie Kalank. I don't know why this movie is being panned by people. It is a very watchable movie with some good hummable songs and images that stay with you. Kalank is a stylized love story set in the backdrop of the times leading to the partition of India. The sets are amazing, as are the Cirque du Soleil like stunts in the operatic style presentation of Ramayan and 'bullfighting' or Jallikattu. Sonakshi Sinha did not have much of a role, but she looks and acts stately. Aditya Roy Kapur looks handsome and acts well, in an understated way, well suited to his role. Kunal Khemu also does justice to his role. Madhuri Dixit, looks good, delivers her lines well, emotes even better. She shows that she should be given serious roles. Sanjay Dutt did not have much of a role, but he is all right. Alia Bhatt acts well, her eyes and emotions conveying the unfulfilled promise of her life, and looks pretty especially in the first song. Varun Dhawan is the one who surprises. He has evolved in this movie, his emotions as a romantic hero are credible. He looks right as a blacksmith with a muscular physique and tough mannerisms. He can evolve further into a crowd pulling heartthrob especially in the hands of a good director like Abhishek Varman. Varun Dhawan, however, needs to work on his diction, his style of speaking, so it sounds cultured and pure and not like a person trying to say his lines in a hurry or in a street style. If he improves his diction, he can be one of the top heroes of the Indian film world. So why should one watch this movie which is being given a very poor rating across the forums? Watch it for its good opera like feel, its larger than life cinematography by Binod Pradhan, its costumes and camerawork. It is somewhat like Saawariya, but much better; it is also like Devdas, but lighter in its touch. Watch it for the choreography of its songs, songs by Pritam and Balhara team, not to forget Arijit Singh's singing, that hitch a ride with you and stake a space in your brain."

        "review_detailed_main": "Yash Johar conceptualized an idea for a film in hopes of something new for Dharma Productions 15 years ago but due to his demise, this idea was pushed until 2019. Abhishek Varman who received fame for his debut film 2 States was roped to handle this conceptualized idea by implementing the direction and screenplay.\n\nAnticipating factors of Kalank 1) Multi-Starrer Seeing Madhuri Dixit & Sanjay Dutt back together after 3 decades 2) Alia-Varun's chemistry 3) Majestic feel\n\nHusnabad is a city that lies between Pakistan & India near Lahore which was set in 1945. The city is known for breeding blacksmiths who produce swords for a living and an influential family with a power known as the Chaudhury's which consist of Balraj who runs a newspaper business and his son Dev whose wife is dying and is told by her to marry Roop. Zafar is a Muslim blacksmith who falls for Roop and their chemistry and their stigma is what forms the story\n\nThere is a saying that \"all style and no substance\" and that is exactly what this film did. A film that had the chance to dodge that bullet but turned out to be a headshot. The screenplay was very inconsistent in terms of its predictability and just messing up the film with such high hopes and aspirations that the audience had for this film by the commonality of religious love with already predicting the outcome of it. The dialogues were very new and it didn't fit that historical culture.\n\nThe acting in this film was somewhat lackluster.\n\nVarun Dhawan's role as Zafar, a blacksmith with daring instincts wasn't that bad but he did overcomplicated while introducing his character during the 1st half of the film. The point where the action scenes started to emerge, that is when his role managed to do justice.\n\nAlia Bhatt's role as Roop, a middle class married to Dev and Zafar's love interest with the passion and endurance of dancing was boring and bland at the same time. Her role didn't have that energetic brilliance that we were expecting.\n\nSonakshi Sinha should seriously get a new acting agent and maybe better roles that fit because the dress she wrapped up in was a wrong fit and that's how I can describe her acting.\n\nAditya Roy Kapoor's roles are all about drinking and getting drunk \"beware\" and that is exactly what Dev did throughout\n\nSanjay Dutt's look was fantastic but his acting was too underwhelming and he was on standpoint throughout.\n\nMadhuri Dixit's role was like a repeat performance on how she acted in both Devdas and Dedh Ishqiya just dancing and little miss \"begum\".\n\nAesthetically it did have that wow factor in terms of its set design and somewhat there was that historical feel to cling onto even with the grainy screenplay.\n\nMusic was a headshot and seeing Pritam just messing up was just obliterating although Ghar More Pardesiyan is a good song.\n\nOverall, potentially wasted and too baseless beyond belief.\n\n2/5"

If Varun Dhawan was not in this movie, it would not be worth watching. I wish the script was written in such a way that two lovers would get together and Mr. Do Chaudhry would die and reach his late wife in that world. They made the appearance of friendship horrible and worthless. I did not understand all this hatred of Abdullah from Zafar. If he killed Dev Chaudhry, everything would be fine, and at that time I watched this movie ten times instead of once. It is true that the script had a problem at the root, but I am still happy that Varun Davan played in this film. Among his comedies, I liked the movie (I am your hero) the most. I wish we felt a change, at least in his comedy films. Like this movie"

This film is really UNDERRATED considering that many worst of the worst Bollywood movies have higher ratings on IMDB so, 3.5 is really low for a movie like this.\n\nIt is just the Bad acting by some actors and few editing mistakes, and yeah definitely the direction could have been better, it's a missed opportunity for a great memorable movie.\n\nThere is very thin line between what makes a movie great to watch and otherwise. Just a few mistakes can ruin a great movie, despite having Everything else excellent.\n\nThe story could have been more complicated, it was emotionally complex no doubt about that, very few movies achieve this level of complexity of emotions, but few good dialogues were not enough to redeem the shortness of this story in full duration of almost 3 hours.\n\nIt definitely gave us a nice visual treat with marvelous music, grand designs which really felt like a work of art.\n\nIt's a good movie nonetheless, 6.4 in my opinion, it had a potential of being 8.2 but missed.\n\nI absolutely love the meaning it conveys, that Kalank Mohabbat ko nahi, nafarat ko hona chahiye. (It should be HATERED that should bring DISGRACE and INFAMY not love!)"

Big actors, huge budget, larger than life sets and by the time you realize there is no story in it you start wondering - Why was it allowed to release or why did the WWII bombs not fall on these dumb characters randomly dancing and crying. That could have saved a lot of lives. What remains by the time movie is finished, is your body strongly questioning your minds decision making ability and your soul searching dor another body to live in. And dare I call it Pathetic, because that word too has its dignity. Do yourself a favor, do not watch this KALANK on movies. But if you do, do not blame anyone, even the makers had warned us with its name - KALANK (which meaning taint / stain)"

Directors and Editors must know that they can't put all the things whatever they have shot. You need to edit and cut. If you can't do that then don't make movies.

A phenomenal movie on the level of classics like Devdas, but with a different tone and flavor. All 6 actors have given their best performances. The cinematography and sets are out of this world - worth seeing it alone for those 2 things. The dialogues were some of the best I've ever heard and the costumes and visual details make you want to watch it again and again. The story was very unique and very good, secrets continue to unfold throughout the movie and best of all, the climax and ending were not predictable! All in all, loved it and can't wait to see it again in the theater!"

Varun Dhawan overacts (with bad pronunciation for the character he plays, as usual) and his overly greased body takes center-stage instead of his acting.

The final scene of chasing train is just extension of DDLJ, unnecessary with boaring end. Director Abhishek Varman, may be crushed under big production name of Karan Jauhar to show unrealistic setups. He forgets that he needs to tell the expression for scenes. Every characters emotion is flat even though story took the turn. With series of big flops like Zero, Thugs Of Hindostan now soon Kalank join the club.

He, delivered an honour killing episode in the best possible manner to hide the emotions of the aged people below his belt, under the smile, and beneath every action.\n\nPeople who failed miserably in recreating the magic were Achint Kaur because of a conspiracy theory that was planned and plotted against the general public who wants to embrace the emotion that holds the future of every technically challenged person alive."

        "review_detailed_main": "To begin with, I went into the movie with minimal expectations of a slightly gripping story, hopefully strong performances, good music (which I had already heard on YouTube), aesthetically pleasing sets and surroundings, good direction, stable production, and simple but strong use of CGI.\n\nPROS: 1. Solid Performances: -The actors all lived up to their characters and did them justice. Never did I once think they were anyone other than who they were pretending to be on the big screen 2. Music and Background Score -Songs were great, and the music had the right inflections to try and ignite the besotted emotions 3. Aesthetically pleasing: -Certainly a bit of a treat to the eyes with the set and costume design\n\nCONS: 1. Confusing, cheesy, stereotypically predictable storyline -Hardly anything was original in the story. I had watched all but 15 minutes to be able to guess what was going to happen, and I was absolutely right. It seemed as if Karan Johar had decided he wanted to add elements that has already been iconically shown in other movies and come up with a cheesier, more dramatic version for this film. 2. Abhorrent storytelling: -if the story wasn't bad enough, the storytelling was even worse. The characters had little to no depth or growth, the love stories were not detailed enough for investment from the audience, there were way too many plot lines happening simultaneously, and each of them had abrupt beginnings or endings. I found myself not caring for a single character or their lives by the end of the movie 3. Excessive use of slow-motion (movie run time 2 hr 50 min) -death by slow mo is literally what this film did to me with the second half and some of the first being littered with slow motion action 4. Ridiculously bad and inessential CGI -Just because you hired a CGI guy, does not mean you need to use them to make unessential, unwarranted frames. WHY KJO? 5. Madhuri's disappointing dance performance with horrible cinematography and choreography\n\nAlthough Kalank's portrayal of strong female leads, positive depictions of minority and marginalised groups, and push for feminism through subtle themes are to be applauded, overall, the cons far outweigh the positives. I do not remember the last time I have sat squirming in my seat in a theatre waiting and praying for a film to end. It felt like a Sanjay Leela Bhansali knockoff where the production team went for an Adidas but came out with a Ababus instead. Kalank was horrendously dragged out, and murdered through it's story telling style with the actual script adding to the misery. It left a bitter aftertaste in my mouth and so I give this movie a solid 1.5/10. I would not recommend this disappointing grub to anyone."

Its genre is not action, thriller, masala, or romcom - it's a periodic love saga! Hence the audiences need to understand its pace and intensity, rather than sitting with expectations of a thriller or otherwise. Millions of fans of love stories (over the globe) are spellbound by the portrayal of Kalank's love story. To be honest, Zafar's love is still living inside many of them - audiences feel the eternal love in Kalank.\n\nTrue, there were some scenes that could've easily been taken-off - the bullfight scene especially. It would've made certain audiences happy with the length of the movie. However, periodic love stories are expected to grow slow alon with grandeur and great cinematic experiences - which is what Kalank is truly about."

        "review_detailed_main": "Abhiskek Varman who gave us the 2 States with his first directorial outing naturally had escalated expectations for his second venture Kalank, boasting of a stellar cast and Bhansali-esq opulent sets. Delving deeper we find the history behind the influence. He was in the directorial team which had assisted SLB for Devdas. Sri Varman clearly forgot that SLB's trappings are always the gossamer around a solid story. Regrettably a weak and yawn-inspiring narrative allows the glitter of lavish trappings to implode. Screenwriter Shibani Bathija who gave us the engaging 'My Name is Khan' fails miserably with this one. Set in a fictional town Husnabad outside Lahore in pre-partion Pakistan in 1945, Kalank remains undecided even at the end of its 166-minute run, whether to be a romantic story or a period drama. Countless questions assail you from the word go as you realise that the town is not the only unbelievable part of the film. Agree that Satya, the daughter-in -law of the Chaudhry clan suffers from a terminal disease and would like to see her husband Dev marry for a second time, but why choose Roop who is so unwilling? Why does a courtesan's abode appear more ostentatious than that of the Chaudhry's? Why the big deal about Zafar's illegitimacy, when apparently the whole world or at least Hira Mandi knows about it? At what point exactly does the friendship between Abdul and Zafar turn sour? Why does Abdul attack Zafar in the end rather than Dev or Roop? You get the drift? The plot is more porous than a blotting paper. And even a 3-year-old toddler would have scoffed at the pathetic VFX of the bull-fight. An insufferable plot made worse by the dead slow pace of the movie just cannot be supported by the laudable histrionics of the cast. Alia Bhatt as Roop and Varun Dhawan as Zafar especially stand out. Kunal Khemu tries his best in a poor role construct of Abdul. Sanjay Dutt and Aditya Roy Kapur underplay their parts well but appear wooden in some shots. Sonakshi is just about ok and Madhuri definitely looks jaded. Kalank like the Titanic sinks under its own weight. After the dismal failures of Thugs of Hindustan and Zero, Bollywood should re-examine the commercial acumen of persisting with big budget, big star and larger than life sets especially when the storyline is weak. The taint of 'Kalank' should remind them of this pitfall."

The set of the movie look totally artificial.\n\nThe flow was so discontinuous and random, at some times the director seemingly got confused.\n\nThe acting? Dixit's outstanding talent in dancing and poising with alluring expressions and grace had been seemingly, ignored.\n\nSonakshi had appeared in very few scenes, which was kind of unfair.\n\nAditya Roy Kapur has definitely made a good comeback after Fitoor, the chemistry between him and Sonakshi was pretty much commendable.\n\nComing to acting done by Varun - A BIG joke.\n\nAnd, Alia Bhatt - swift and sweet yet a novice at some points especially in dancing.\n\nA big NO this movie.\n\nIn future, I am totally going to avoid any of the film produced by Karan Johar."

Also, the twist adds up when Roop falls in love with Zafar (Varun Dhawan). As the story unfolds further in the film, you will witness all the emotions at once. Be it heartbreak, love, happiness, etc.\n\n*Performance* - Varun Dhawan & Alia Bhatt stand out of the crowd throughout the film, the will never let you down when it comes to their chemistry, Sanjay Dutt has a less screen presence but its hard-hitting and impactful, whenever he is on screen and especially with Madhuri Uff.. they both literally Lit up the screen. On the other hand, Aditya Roy Kapur and Sonakshi Sinha are pretty average and do their part quite well. Kunal Khemu is a surprise package as he shines out in the 2nd half.\n\n*What's Good -*\n\n\n*What's Disappointing -*\n\n\n*Final Verdict* - Kalank will have its own audiences, it's not everyone's cup of tea I'll say. Some will enjoy it thoroughly while others will be bored for sure. It's way-way-way too Over-Dramatized. You can Skip this movie and instead save your money for Avengers: EndGame which releases next week.\n\n*My Ratings - \u2b50\u2b50\ud83d\udcab( 2.5/ 5)*"

Coming to Madhuri Dixit's performance - a lot more was expected from Madhuri Dixit. I think should have made her comeback with grandeur acting and performance. After watching series of movies that Madhuri Dixit has done recently, she must quit industry and give chance to other theater actors who can pull it off with their outstanding performance."

        "review_detailed_main": "Storyline is good however what disappoints us as viewers is the slow pace. And this slow pace is the actual cause that people found the duration of the film unjustified. It is set as a period drama with nice dialogues here and there that make the film soulful and worth-watching for one time.The film started with an abrupt scene and the flashback narrative from Alia came much later that led to confusion. Many scenes were unnecessarily long whereas some of them were insignificant adding no progression to the story.\n\nSanjay Dutt was missing his ferocity. Madhuri's attempts to balance her 'adaa' and 'kirdar' are worth a praise. She has proven that she would be the right choice for 'Pakeezah's remake if ever made. Alia Bhatt proved yet again that she is working hard on her acting skills. For Varun Dhawan, it could have been a lot better if his role had more anger instead of perennial anguish and chronic complains of being an illegitimate child. Aditya Roy Kapoor was quite disappointing. He was stone-faced and had confusing face expressions. If the story had shown Satya (Sonakshi Sinha) as already dead, and instead Balraj Choudhry convincing Dev to remarry, the movie not only had had less duration but less confusion too. And by the way, where were Dev & Satya's boys and girls as they were not shown even once throughout the movie? So, why mention them? Kunal Khemu's role was nicely etched and he did more justice than anyone else.\n\nOverall, it is a film with a good heart. If you expect to watch a period film with slow pace, you won't be disappointed. However, if you are looking for the frivolosity of contemporary Cinema From this grandeur casting, you might feel cheated. So, set your perspective right!"

BGM was also so irritating. Not sure but something was missing in Alia's performance she was so blank and bleak that I hated her for the first time , her nostrils flaring gimmick is becoming repetitive for some reason. Her dancing was equally graceless. Varun what to say about him he was so confused about his performance that he was sleep walking in the entire movie copying Shahrukh which was a failed attempt. Aditya Roy Kapoor , Sonakshi , Madhuri and Sanjay Dutt all are wasted in the movie. Still can't understand why they infact made this movie. So so unworthy. Ghar more pardesiya was the only thing worth watching that to majorly for shreya Ghosal and amazing production set. Waste of time otherwise."

The story had a HUGE plot twist. The dialogue in the movie was really good as well. I definitely recommend that you see Kalank. If you don't want to spend the money wait for it to come on Netflix.

A epic love story that's takes you with them in their love journey with beautiful rhythmic poetic dialogues and equally enchanting canvas. They hammered it for it's rhythmic dailogues seriously a love story with Muslim backdrop will not even have shayrana andaaz. Mirza Galib poetry used to flows in viens of mostly everyone during that era specially in Punjab ..One thing disappointing is screenplay which doesn't flow smoothly ..But this is minor crack in otherwise Masterpiece it's beautiful enchanting experience for any die hard romantic..Varun Madhuri acting so top level ...Every nuance of their character so we'll depicted by them ..

        "review_detailed_main": "Kalank, a period drama, with lots of characters. Few positive facts about the movie: 1. Heavy sets and grand palaces. The lavish sets remind you of the Sanjay Leela Bhansali's grand sets. Art director has taken extra cautions while planning the set. 1940s India has been shown properly without any sign of modernity. 2. Music is the biggest USP of the movie. Background score and songs are unforgettable. Title song is so melodious with sweet and appealing voice of legends like Arijit, Shreya, Javed Ali..... 3. The story is good with twist and turns leading to the death of the protagonist. The end has been woven unpredictably. 4. Love affair between a Muslim boy and Hindu woman in 1940s India shown in a well mannered way. 5. All characters are given due importance. Their utilization has been done in proper way.\n\nFew Negative facts about the movie: 1. The movie revolves around the extra marital affair of second wife of a renowned Hindu press owner, with a Muslim boy who was born out of an illicit affair of her prostitute mother. The extra marital affair of Hindu woman has been shown without any objection from the society. No one talking about such affair in 1940s is indigestible. 2. Muslims are shown as short tempered, easy to tampered, mindless and aggressive. Merely saying that machines would displace man leads to riots. Communal violence, which is initiated for no political reason is bizarre. 3. The prostitute is living in an ornate fancy palace. The palace is build in between the water body and one must travel by boat to reach there. Bit showy. 4. India is always rich in its varied heritage. Classical music and classic singers are well known personalities of the ages. But here the singing is restricted to prostitutes only. 5. The animation team of the movie should work hard as the bull fighting scene is not upto the mark. 6. Length of the movie is the last but not the least factor that adds to its negative reviews."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Kalank\" is a classic example of style over substance. Despite its grand scale, elaborate sets, and a star-studded cast, the movie fails to deliver where it matters most: storytelling and emotional depth.\n\nThe plot feels unnecessarily convoluted, with forced drama and zero connection to the audience. The characters are shallow, their motivations unclear, and their arcs unconvincing. Even powerhouse performers like Alia Bhatt, Varun Dhawan, and Sanjay Dutt seem wasted in poorly written roles.\n\nThe dialogues, which should evoke emotion in a period drama, come across as overly dramatic and often cringe-worthy. The pacing is painfully slow, dragging the movie to an unbearable length.\n\nWhile the film is visually stunning, with beautiful cinematography and costumes, it lacks soul. A good movie needs more than just a glossy surface. The songs, though well-composed, feel shoehorned into the narrative without adding value to the story.\n\nIn summary, Kalank is a colossal disappointment. It's a prime example of how a movie can look grand but feel empty. Not worth the time or money."

So I wanted to change the channel, but the decoration, the costumes, and the beautiful restoration of the historic space, the detail of the film, and the type of filming attracted me. There are countless beautiful sequences and decoupages in this film, which is brilliant and engaging, showing that many groups have worked behind the scenes. I don't like or follow Bollywood, I think the actors are average and this story is very repetitive. Overall, fans of \"filmin taking\" and \"scene design\" will love this movie"

        "review_detailed_main": "Kalank promised to be a grand period drama with a stellar cast including Varun Dhawan, Alia Bhatt, Sanjay Dutt, Madhuri Dixit, and Sonakshi Sinha, but unfortunately, it fails to deliver on almost every level. The movie's biggest flaw is its weak and unconvincing storyline. Despite a compelling setting, the plot is melodramatic and full of clich\u00e9s, offering nothing new or original.\n\nVarun Dhawan's performance as Zafar feels uninspired and lacks the emotional depth required for such a character. Alia Bhatt's character, Roop, is poorly written and lacks any real substance, leaving her to struggle with a role that doesn't give her enough room to shine.\n\nMadhuri Dixit and Sanjay Dutt, two legends of Indian cinema, are sadly underutilized, with roles that are more about creating spectacle than adding anything meaningful to the plot. Sonakshi Sinha's portrayal of Satya was also forgettable, and she hardly makes an impact.\n\nThe film's visual appeal is the only thing that stands out, with extravagant sets, costumes, and music, but even that doesn't compensate for the lack of substance in the script. The dialogues feel heavy-handed, and the emotional moments feel forced rather than heartfelt.\n\nOverall, Kalank tries too hard to be an epic but falls flat due to its shallow characters, predictable plot, and lackluster performances. It's a film that promises much but delivers very little."

This movie was worse that Bahubali, which had great VFX, cinematography, and locations! The cast members like Varun Dhawan, Alia Bhatt, Sanjay Dutt, Sonakshi Sinha, Aditya Roy Kapoor, and Kunal Khemu's performances were satisfactory. But Madhuri Dixit was amazing, flawless, and gorgeous! She was the only actress, who was very talented in Kalank! I honestly watched this movie for Madhuri Dixit! I got to know that Madhuri Dixit's role was originally given to Sridevi, who was one of the greatest actresses in Indian Cinema! Madhuri Dixit got this role when Sridevi suddenly died! Anyway, Madhuri Dixit's performance was absolutely fabulous! The only obvious and positive thing in Kalank was Madhuri Dixit's amazing performance! The remaining things in the movie were not good. The storyline wasn't great, and some character arcs were not engaging. The movie would have been amazing if the director did a great job on everything. S. S. Rajamouli and Sanjay Leela Bhansali would be considered as 2 of the best directors of Indian Cinema since their movies and direction were too fantastic! The director of Kalank could have learned something from them! Anyway, Kalank wasn't a box office blockbuster since it obviously failed to entertain the audience. I wouldn't watch this movie again since it was not a great movie. Now, don't watch this movie unless you are huge fans of the lead actors in Kalank! I have watched this movie for Madhuri Dixit only because I am a huge fan of Madhuri Dixit. She is the only actress, who is amazing in Kalank! This is my honest review of Kalank!"
