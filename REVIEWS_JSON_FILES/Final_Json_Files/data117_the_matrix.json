The mystery about what the Matrix is, unravels and you see a dystopian future unlike any we as a race would want. I have watched this over and over and never tire of it. Everyone does a great job acting in this, the special effects are above par and the story is engaging."

Iconic scenes are still having benchmarks setting up.\n\nIf we say it sci-fi at its best, it won't be wrong. The hype was real, it is still not easy to match the level of Matrix where we experience the connection of humans and science, that too with amazing action fight and chase scenes, not just normal scenes they were, multiple exposures, slow motion 3D moves, Oh My God, and it's understandable as well like what are the characters up to and what storyline they are entering into. The script was very well written and executed otherwise it could have been a mess. A special appreciation in managing the theme with those black color costumes and a scientific zone with unimaginable equipment and props doing unbelievable things in the two worlds created. No spoilers, but the action scenes in the climax where the protagonist goes to save someone from agents are really breathtaking. The technology used at its best.\n\nA salute to Wachowski Brothers and the team for creating this masterpiece. It will be a great competition and motivation as well for many films coming in the future."

        "review_detailed_main": "The story of a reluctant Christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, MTV backdrop, The Matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come.\n\nHollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre. There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (Or nobody simply cared about anything.) There a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody 'ooh'-ed or 'aah'-ed at the special effects. With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync. Not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition. Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated.\n\nBut what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes. The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky. The kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of. The photography was breathtaking. (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.) And the acting? Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did. But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting. As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked! Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne. His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out.\n\nPeople will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation. My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE. What is the Matrix, you ask? Something that's closer to reality than you think.\n\nEither that or it's my personal choice for best film of all-time."

        "review_title": "Immensely entertaining, intriguingly philosophical and just about one of the best films ever made!",
        "review_detailed_main": "Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film justice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn't until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film. I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn't until I wrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. I won't say that I have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.\n\nActing wise the film works excellently. I won't say that there aren't any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix (and the sequels). He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don't wan't to spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor (mostly in the sequels). Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.\n\nEffects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my God has it already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.\n\nThe reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I didn't see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I think I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the film draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name (Neo = one, as in The One) but also hidden in his other name, Thomas A. Anderson. The first part of his last name, Anderson comes from the Greek Andros meaning \"man\" and combine this with the second part of his last name \"son\" and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination \"son of man\" which was a title Jesus came up with about himself. Also the first time we meet Neo a man calls him (and I quote): \"You're my Saviour man. My own personal Jesus Christ.\" It doesn't get any more obvious than that. Aside from the Christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism, Gnosticism (Gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by Plato and his analogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard's essay, Simulacra and Simulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them further.\n\nTo all the people who doubt the profound nature of The Matrix I can only give one advice: Free your mind and watch the film again. You won't regret it. If I had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either The Matrix (obviously I don't expect people to agree but if they do thats great) or The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and I recommend it to all fans of sci-fi and people who like philosophy.\n\n10/10 - on my top 3 of best films."

But after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it (and believe me, I hear bad reviews for every movie I enjoy) I decided to give it a try. At first, although I really loved the fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you'll find out everything you could want to know) By the second time I watched it, I really understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.\n\nI really loved this movie. Just about every character, good or bad, is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity). Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.\n\nThe plot is one of the best movie plots I've seen in a movie. An accountant by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. Not only that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does, so you can really relate to his character.\n\nMy favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated, but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away."

        "review_detailed_main": "Without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time, the Matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990's and the biggest leap the genre has taken since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The Matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.\n\nThe film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by A.I powered machines.\n\nThe direction and script by the Wachowskis is fantastic, as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great sci-fi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film, combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style, substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. The research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. Every character presented on the film, has a well-defined arc and a purpose, and their motivations are clear.\n\nThe cinematography is impeccable. It was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements, the zooms, the slow-motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the Matrix and the real World. The editing is flawless, as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. Each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. The visual effects introduced us to the bullet-time effect and their impact can still be felt in today's movies. The performances are also incredible. Each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life, but the one that stands out the most is Hugo Weaving's disciplined rendition of his character, Agent Smith; a powerful computer program made to search and destroy the human rebellion, in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career.\n\nIn conclusion The Matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. It is one of the most thought provoking, inventive, pioneering, influential and stylish movies of all time and it's also full of philosophical and religious allegories waiting for interpretation. Immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture, its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects, excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best, most influential and most entertaining movies ever made."

Yes, it had great cinematography and effects, yes it had a great soundtrack but NO WAY was the acting superb and NO WAY was the storyline great.\n\nTake that storyline and stick it in any other action movie and you would leave feeling disappointed at the end. It's major selling point was \"What is the Matrix? You have to see it for yourself.\" Come on, the only plot twist was that thing to do with Cypher, and that wasn't greatly unforeseeable, there's things like that in every frigging action movie.\n\nThe thing that set it apart was the ground-breaking camera effects, gnarly special effects and a funky soundtrack, as well as the costume design bit, with all that leather and expensive sunglasses. Without this stuff, all you would be left with is your average action movie.\n\nI'm not saying it was a bad film at all, just not one of the greatest. Highly entertaining, great to watch with your mates, definitely one of the most interesting films in recent years. But give me The Third Man, Memento or the Usual Suspects any day.\n\n7/10"

The camera angle, costume, music, and the gunfights.. all these qualities shine the heroes. The entertainment value of this movie should not be overlooked because of its high quality and philosophy.\n\nI can see how much research Wachowski sisters put in to make their imaginations and concepts realized in the two-hour movie in plausible ways. How is dystopian future and present is connected? How does dream within a dream work? All the questions about their imaginary world is answered because they pay attention to details and they explain every existence and terms with logic one step at a time. There is no leap of logic, very tightly well-woven script.\n\nTheir concept is not just future or imaginary anymore. In 2020, we see AI taking over many of works and jobs that humans used to do and invading privacy. Virtual reality games gain popularity over time, and you see Neo everywhere who adapts quickly in the Internet world and learn the combat game so fast and naturally.\n\nThe impact of 'The Matrix' in the movie industry is more than imaginable. Of course, revolutionary visual effects with elaborated CGI techniques created iconic bullet-dodging scene of Neo. Because the Matrix system in the movie is kindly well-explained, it widens a scale of sci-fi genre. Hunger Games, Inception, Eagle Eye, Wall-E, and so many other movies that followed benefited from this epic work."

The Matrix along with They Live have the best metaphors about life/society, most of which a lot of the population aren't woke to!\n\nFor example the entire speech Morpheus says \"The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. That you are a slave, Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind.\" Among other brilliant quotes like when he talks about what the world has become, then mentions we have become this referring to a battery. So many genius lines I could list that I won't.\n\nThe effects, stunts, lighting, sounds, and tone are outstandingly spot on! They really did train for the fight sequences for months I've seen all the special features plus more. Yes this is a sci-fi film, but I see it as a documentary as well. We're all slaves that take the blue pill throughout many things it's just hard to realize that. I also love what someone else said, it's a benchmark for sci-fi to come, that is very true and it's the last of its kind; movies aren't made like this anymore!\n\nA lot of people worked hard to make this film what it is. I respect that; I've always wanted to work on film just haven't had a way for many reasons. If you've read this far or even at all thanks and sorry! I usually don't leave a review this long, just thought it was worth it for this one. Check out my others if you're interested for now 10 out of 10 phenomenal movie in many ways!"

        "review_detailed_main": "20 years after its release, and several years since I last saw it, some reflections on the experience of rewatching The Matrix. In no particular order ...\n\n1) It still look great. I mean, this is one amazing, stylish looking phone. Very little about the look of the film has dated - the mobile phones, obviously, Neo's computer, and very briefly a couple of visual effects creak. But otherwise, this looks as amazing at it did on release. It's sumptuous.\n\n2) I think I was one of the many who misjudged Keanu Reeves all those yeas ago. I made easy jokes about his vacant stare and apparent intelligent. From this vantage point we can see he's been in a good number of successful, intelligent films. It's also become clear that within the industry he as a reputation as decent, hardworking man who is a pleasure to work with.\n\n3) It's apparent again how literate and cine-literate the film is. I knew this 20 years ago, but since then I've seen a lot more films and read a lot more books, and this time around I especially loved the way the film nods its head to other film genres and influences. I noticed a lot of Peckinpah, and did I see a nod to Kurosawa there too? And I was reminded that for an English Literature graduate like me, this is a goldmine of quotes, allusions and references.\n\n4) Seen 20 years on, its influence on cinema since is clear. There's a lot we could talk about here, but I was especially struck by how indebted a director like Christopher Nolan is (keeper of the flame of intelligent blockbusters), especially with Inception.\n\n5) I'd forgotten that the narrative ostensibly maintains uncertainty about Neo's identity until just before the end. I'm not sure this really works - anyone who's read many books or ever done an anagram will not find that the most suspenseful part of the narrative.\n\n6) Despite a run time of 2 and a quarter hours, it never flags and attention never wonders. The film fizzes with kinetic energy and the time flies by. It's a lean film, without a wasted moment.\n\n7) The film is, of course, packed with religious allusions. When I wrote a chapter on this for my BA Theology dissertation, I said I thought the film was neo-Bhuddist (forgive the pun, please), and I stand by that on rewatching. Of course, there's lots of allusions to Christian and other theology, and The Matrix spawned some really bad reading of film by Christians which has never really stopped. When will some Christians learn to read a film/book etc with integrity and understanding of what the film is trying to do? It's a spiritually confused mish-mash of a film - but still a gloriously entertaining one.\n\n8) All these years later, it turns out The Matrix was somewhat prophetic about the role technology would play in our lives. Humans permanently plugged in to networks? Different layers of reality that are somehow more real than what we think of as real? The Wachowskis saw all that and more coming 20 years ago. Artists are the weather vane of society; we really should learn to pay attention to them.\n\n9) Bottom line. I still bloody love this film. I'm trying to work out if I have the requisite strength to revisit the sequels...."

It's a brilliant movie on a number of different levels - the directing is excellent, the camera work is great, the visuals are stunning, the kung-fu is A+, acting is executed with style and conviction, and the plot is truly inspired. It's really hard to use enough superlatives on this movie!\n\nIt'd be a 10/10, except for the ending. Having Neo do what he does at the end really lets it down, in my opinion. However, there's a couple of sequels on the way, so let's see what the Wachowskis can do to make up for it.\n\nOther than that, (and like I said above) the movie is operating on so many different levels that each time you watch it, you pick up something new... this isn't by accident, either. The Wachowski brothers had the actors read a number of definitive works (Simulation & Simulcra was one I believe) in modern literature and psychology, and applied liberal dashings of aspects of the major religions to provide the best sci-fi movie of the decade, if not ever.\n\nI'm yet to meet somebody who hasn't enjoyed it. It's my favourite movie to watch on a good cinema system, too."

Luckily, these can be ignored fairly easily.\n\nGood action sequences for the most part. Most of the cast is summer-movie capable. i.e. Their acting is neither embarrassing nor impressive. Keanu gives his second-best performance ever (after Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure). Unfortunately, that is likely merely the convergence of his naturally confused look with the confusion inherent to the character.\n\nAll things considered a fun action movie provided you don't buy the hype telling you that it is so much more.\n\nBy the way, stop with this one. This movie is watchable and complete in its own and is only degraded by its truly dreadful sequels. If this movie is the triumph of style over substance, its sequels are the cruel beating and maiming of substance by style gone bad."

This ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executed.\n\nParticularly striking about 'The Matrix' is its production values. Simply put, the film looks amazing in its audacious production design, dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultra-cool and imaginative to exist, super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography. So much more than a film with ground-breaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundaries.\n\nUse of sound was also striking, and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used. Andy and Larry Wachowski direct adeptly, while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and well-explored themes, mysticism, philosophy and even Lewis Carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly done.\n\nAction is superbly shot and edited, and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy, Kung Fu has rarely been more vertigo-inducing (despite how this sounds, this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the story's atmosphere) on film.\n\nKeanu Reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler, certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then. Carrie Anne Moss is strong. Even better are an imposingly charismatic Laurence Fishburne (also in one of his best roles), an amusing Joe Pantoliano and a deliciously wicked Hugo Weaving.\n\nSumming up, not one of the best of the genre but a mile-stone nonetheless and a great one. Followed by two sequels, both nowhere near in the same ball-park. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

The camera angles really work for the action sequences and the choreographed fight scenes made me yearn for more. Say what you want about Keanu Reeves' acting.

There have been lots of theories regarding it. And the plot is very simple with many plot holes. Neo as the chosen one isn't portrayed correctly. I see no special abilities in him.\n\nFights were really silly and were too long where you get bored and just want to skip them and I see no reason why trinity fell in love with neo when they didn't spend any time together at all , just because a fortune teller told her that she would fell in love with the chosen one , is it how emotions work? Well , I don't think so.\n\nApart from these there are a bunch of positive things too. Special effects were awesome considering that this movie came out in 1999. The idea of the story is innovative for Hollywood and matrix came out in era where there isn't much interest in sci-fi among filmmakers while the thrillers ruled them. So these things made it highly rated back then in 1999. Watching today wouldn't make much sense considering that special effects based movies are ruling the theaters now and every now and then sci fi movies are being released."

I first watched this film when I was merely 12, and was absolutely blown away by it, and rewatching it now, i'm so glad to catch so many little things that add to the depth of this film and its storytelling. The Wachowski's have created something masterful here, creating a dystopian sci-fi world unlike any other before it and managing to not only build upon it greatly throughout the film but allow the audience to be immersed within it as well. It's a movie that makes you think, and it may start off a bit slow because of that, but it knows what it's trying to do, and it doesn't need to apologize for it. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, and Carrie-Anne Moss provide for excellent leads throughout the film. The cinematography is unique and gritty, its action style more than entertaining, and its deeper themes of societal norms and challenges make for quite an interesting commentary. Its special effects may not have aged very well today, but at the time they were quite unique and it fits the films vibe in a way that truly has to be seen to be believed. In the end, The Matrix is a sci-fi masterpiece and no one can tell me otherwise. Its an intricate and beautifully executed blend of action, sci-fi, and potential and just may be one of my favorite films the 1990's had to offer.\n\nMy Rating: 9.9/10."

He is looking for Morpheous (Lawrence Fishburn) who could give him the answer to the question 'What is the Matrix?' The more relevant questions to ask, though, would be \"How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?\" and \"How would you know if what is happening right now is not a virtual reality?\"\n\nThe antagonist, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), is one of my favourite characters. Just watch his mouth - the way he speaks, the tone and pitch of his voice, his pronunciation, even the pauses he makes while speaking, have an incredible effect on the viewer. The concept of people being like cancer to this world is absolutely astounding.\n\nCarrie Ann Moss was the perfect choice for Trinity because any other blond, big lipped, big brested 'bimbo' would have totally ruined her character.\n\nA few more questions pop up in one's mind. \"Haven't we gone too far creating such super intelligent machines?\", \"What if they become so powerfull one day and take control over humanity?\"\n\nThe acting's just amazing, all of them, no exceptions. The 4 leading characters though... (Morphy, Trinity, Neo & Agent Smith) - (yes, to me there are 4 leads) - I love them all. I can't imagine the movie with any other 4 actors but L. Fishbourn, C.A. Moss, Keanu and H. Weaving. They were born to play those roles.\n\nWhoever did the casting did a terrific job. Bravo!\n\nBrilliant, absolutely brilliant!"

So a friend lent me the video and I finally got a chance to see it. It's a pretty remarkable film. The premise of an alternative reality works here where it often fails. Keanu Reeves is a sort of messiah, not by his own choosing originally. He has been attacked and abused by men in sunglasses whom, we find out later, are a part of a representation of Artificial Intelligence. The side Neo ends up on are the original humans whose ranks have been nearly driven to extinction. Laurence Fishburne is the leader of the rebels and he believes the the Reeves character is \"the One.\" I thoroughly enjoyed it but would have like a little more creative final scene. Too many shell casings. Apparently, weaponry didn't advance much in twenty years. But, it keeps one on edge with its special effects and its non-stop action."

Reality is the only what we see and feel.\n\nWe can understand the movie in different ways. You will see what you emphasize. Slavery, the fight against the system, the role of man in this system and the system in life, fanaticism and faith, chosenness and resurrection.\n\nI suggest watching The Matrix even if you've already watched it."

The action scenes and special effects are awesome. They really did set new standards and knocked that hackneyed load of tripe The Phantom menace into the bin. The ending is also fantastic- there is no way that an ending this perfect was meant to be followed by two mediocre sequels\n\nHowever, The plot is more full of holes than a fishnet stocking. For instance- I know this is nit picking- but how can Cypher be betraying the crew when not only do they have to plug him into the matrix for him to go and meet the agents in the first instance, but are also monitoring said conversation.\n\nSecondly- the philosophical parts. The matrix basically asks the question is it better to live the dream. The flaw comes in that in this case it is quite clearly better- great, so mankind is not \"free\" but each person lives a sufficiently realistic existence inside their own head for it not to matter. If the alternative is living in fear and squalor, dodging sentinels whilst eating what looks like congealed semen then I would frankly rather live inside my own dreams dining on fine food etc.\n\nNext up, the acting. Could someone please explain to me how Keanu Reeves is a leading man. He single handedly trashes all the good work put in by the supporting cast- especially Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving. Anyway how can I be expected to take a film seriously where Keanu is effectively god?\n\nOverall, a reasonable film but not the second coming of Christ so many people think it is."

        "review_detailed_main": "In the realm of cinematic landmarks, few films have blurred the lines of reality and provoked philosophical ponderings quite like \"The Matrix.\" Released in 1999, this groundbreaking film from the Wachowskis isn't merely a visual spectacle; it is a thought-provoking exploration of existence, consciousness, and the nature of reality itself, making it a masterpiece that resonates profoundly even today.\n\n\"The Matrix\" catapults audiences into an intricate universe where humanity is unknowingly ensnared in a simulated reality created by artificial intelligence. Keanu Reeves delivers a stunning performance as Neo, a hacker drawn into a rebellion that challenges the very fabric of his understood world. This narrative is punctuated by striking characters, each embodying profound philosophical archetypes; Morpheus, with his unwavering belief in prophecy and fate, and Trinity, who symbolizes both strength and connection, serve as guiding lights in Neo's journey of self-discovery.\n\nThe film's visuals are nothing short of revolutionary. The signature \"bullet time\" effect not only redefined the action genre but also serves as a metaphor for the clarity gained when one awakens to the truth. With every slow-motion leap and gravity-defying dodge, the film invites viewers to question their perception. The stunning choreography of the fight scenes-elegant yet visceral-transports the audience into a world where every choice reverberates with existential weight.\n\nBeneath this dazzling exterior lies an intricately woven narrative rich with philosophical inquiry. The Matrix poses questions that tug at the very essence of human existence: What is real? Can we trust our senses? In an age increasingly dominated by technology, the film's cautionary tale becomes strikingly relevant. It dares us to reflect on the data-driven realities we inhabit and challenges the notion of choice when confronted with overwhelming digital influence.\n\nThe film's infamous \"blue pill/red pill\" dichotomy embodies the quintessential human choice-between comfort in ignorance and the painful truths of reality. It speaks to the dissonance many feel today amidst the barrage of information and entertainment that can distract us from authentic experience.\n\nDavid's haunting score, combined with a distinctive, neo-noir visual style, enriches the film's atmosphere, creating a sense of foreboding and urgency as the protagonists navigate their treacherous world. The dialogues are imbued with philosophical depth, offering nuggets of wisdom that resonate long after the final scene.\n\n\"The Matrix\" is not just a film; it is a cultural phenomenon that transcended its genre. It invites viewers to ponder profound questions, urging us to look beyond the surface of our existence and to consider the forces that shape our realities. As we navigate a world rife with virtual experiences and complex technologies, \"The Matrix\" remains an enduring beacon-a challenge to seize our autonomy and discern truth from illusion."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've always called the first Matrix film a rip-off. It's a mix of many different films put together with component parts stolen from the Terminator (robots rule the future and have enslaved the remainder of humanity), Total Recall (futuristic 'Is it a dream or reality' sci-fi) and even Johnny Mnemonic (futuristic cyberpunk trash starring Keanu Reeves as a guy who can plug computers into his head and 'go into them'), plus various other works by William Gibson and a lot of Anime.\n\nThomas 'Neo' Anderson, is a computer programmer/hacker who meets with the mythical cyber-terrorist Morpheous, who asks Neo if he wishes to know the truth about the world or live a lie forever. Neo chooses truth and soon wakes in a gel-filled pod in a techno-hell future. His body, and billions of others, is nothing more than a battery to power the machines that rule the future (exactly what they do with this world that they now rule is not explored).\n\nConvinced that Neo is 'The One', Morpheous trains him to be deadly digital warrior, but this set-up doesn't go beyond fighting a sentient program called Agent Smith. The war against the machines comes later.\n\nThere's no denying that the film, unfortunately, was massively influential for virtually every action film that followed. Gone was the 'Die Hard' formula where action was gritty, somewhat realistic, and with practical stuntwork. In it's place they all went for excessive CGI, green-tinted photography, impossible cameras, and impossible physics. The Matrix is semi-stylish with it, but it doesn't ever entertain or excite me.\n\nIt's the style of the Matrix that's more fondly cherished than the story. It won 4 technical Academy Awards, proving that all the Matrix is is eye-candy. Call that narrow-minded if you want but I believe this movie is no more than a very, very popular cult movie. A contradiction in terms yes, but still the most appropriate way of describing it."

What would i think of the film on first viewing almost 20 years later?\n\nI never lost interest during this film and I can see why it was such a huge hit in 1999. Its heartening when any highly stylised film which isn't utter base level bilge to take megabucks at the box office.\n\nBut heres where The Matrix succeeds brilliantly. It offers mind blowing concepts- but isn't too deep. It offers striking visuals- which unfortunately quickly became de rigueur as many other films, commercials and pop videos copied this visual style. Not the fault of the filmmakers and as they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.\n\nCertain parts of the film feel like a comic book fans fapfest. The costumes assumed by the main protagonists would only be thought cool by basement dwelling geeks. Black PVC, long coats and clumpy boots- a cyberpunk's wet dream. Soo late 90s.\n\nBut this film did dare to take to the masses something original and daring. It succeeded. Fair play especially in these times of stale remakes and turgid reboots. But don't try to interpret things too deeply. Beneath the surface isn't a whole lot of depth or substance. Precisely why it was so massive.\n\nThe scene need the end where we learn that Neo really is 'the one' is one of the most bombastic, unintentionally hilarious sequences in modern cinema. I don't know if its pure cheese, genius or both. Which is noteworthy in itself.\n\nBut for a film that tries to show us what the modern world is really like and what it revolves around I'll still stick with They Live. A film that accomplishes its mission statement with less gloss, has infinitely more depth, substance and charm and does so on a substantially smaller budget than The Matrix."

Thats when I finally understood the 2/3 of the film. Matrix forced me the Red Pill on entertainment and films."

A lot of thought provoking material, and some interesting subtleties. I've seen it 10 times (I don't usually watch a movie more than once), and I'll watch it a few more. Enjoy!"

Quite original for a Hollywood flick, it is often given more credit than it deserves. The giant plot hole is that using people as batteries makes absolutely no sense. Contrived in its core, it however delivers many themes and is a decent movie, and the influence it has ups its rating a bit. But lets not get over ourselves, this is not Terminator or other such gem, not by any stretch. Still, worth a watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "A lot of people like The Matrix because they think it's deep. In fact its apparent deepness is its primary selling point, and is what has turned it into a blockbuster and trendsetter. Just ponder over this, because there's a contradiction here. Whenever has Hollywood hit the jackpot by being profound, either in a philosophical or religious way? Something strange is going on here. A lot of the mystery disappears after we identify exactly what belief the Wachowski brothers are purveying here. It's Scientology. They are telling us that the power of the mind is able to free us from the matrix of the senses. The scientologists are anxious to free themselves and become thetans \u2013 omnipresent and omni-powerful minds.\n\nNow, the success of The Matrix tells me just one thing, that people have become closet scientologists. They don't grapple with the issue of \"appearance and reality\" in the way scientologists do, but the core belief is there. They might call themselves an atheist, or an evolutionist (\"We only accept what science tells us\"), but that's only an excuse for not really sorting out what they really believe in. So, along comes a film called The Matrix and it hits a chord. They can identify with Neo because they are aware of a thing called corporate media manipulating reality for them. They are also brought up on computer games, and so it's not too big a leap to imagine a virtual world completely replacing the real one. I can see how closet scientologists can completely immerse themselves in the plight of Neo and his Christ-like struggle to free humanity from the clutches on the senses and become omni-powerful minds (in the parlance of the film, taking them to promised city of Zion).\n\nIn that sense, the film is profound, in that it resonates with popular belief so accurately. There is just enough spattering of science and philosophy to take them in. People want to believe in science, but they don't want to be troubled like Einstein was (\"Does God play dice?\"). The most convincing part of the film is where Morpheus demonstrates to Neo how virtual reality is created. This, and the recurring motif of \"freeing the mind\" are the only authentic components of the film. The rest is a conventional Hollywood action flick, and one that is totally at odds with the underlining philosophy. Considering the struggle with agent Smith, and the frequent popping in and out of virtual reality, nothing makes sense. This is where real confusion starts to parade as profundity.\n\nI always thought that it was only intellectuals who mistook confusion for profundity, but apparently normal cinema-goers do too. Maybe intellectuals and Hollywood action flick fans have something in common after all. They both worship the rational mind. And when rationality delivers a mess, the mess itself is seen as something profoundly rational. Maybe that's the crowing achievement of the Wachowski brothers. They have composed the \"Being and Time\" for the masses. But Heidegger's philosophical book was mostly pretentious garbage, and so is the Matrix."

It marries Lewis Carroll with HongKong Kung Fu wirework and the back trenchcoat. They invent bullet time and amp up the cool factor in gun fights.\n\nThe story borrows heavily from a lot of different sources. Machines have taken over. The world is a computer construct. People fight using computer avatars. These are all ideas that have been done before. The Wachowskis have weaved it all together into a functional tapestry.\n\nBut it is ultimately the cool visuals that makes this movie unique. For a relatively lower big budget, the production value is incredible. They have squeezed every movie magic out of all the visual and computer effects."

Some people they make fun of the idea that one day humans will be in direct war with machines but those people have not read yet about the Nano technology. The latter technology offers something like the software which teaches Neo how to fight in little time. Well through Nano, they will be able to plant a brainlike chip which works 10,000 times faster than our brain and they are now trying to optimize the speed limit in a way that doesn't endanger our brain which might be burnt working under such speed.\n\nAs for the flying part, it is very possible if the science of Psychokinesis is given more consideration and in the near future I reckon they will with the evolution of human body which is going toward less and less movement. Has anyone seen the prototype of the new cars which have no pedals and we use sticks to drive and direct the car in different directions.\n\nWell, I guess the movie has tackled all these scientific aspects alongside psychological and philosophical ones in a very brilliant way and I 100% give this move 20 on a scale out of 10!"

        "review_detailed_main": "A large part of the appeal of 'The Matrix' for me was the special effects and action-packed scenes. But, on reflection, part of the appeal is also its philosophical and religious underpinnings...\n\nWhen asked whether Buddhist ideas influenced them, the Wachowski brothers offered an unqualified \"Yes!\" and at a very basic level, the movie portrays two levels of reality: our everyday existence and a deeper, more significant, underlying reality (the matrix). This is very much like the Two Truths in Buddhism: relative truth, in which everything is perception, and ultimate truth which is the way things really are (objective reality).\n\nBecause of our ignorance, we mistake the everyday world for something real and objective, and this is the cause of our suffering. As in 'The Matrix', breaking through relative truth to direct contact with ultimate truth represents a high spiritual attainment, some would say enlightenment, an awakening. (Remember the message on Neo's computer screen: \"Wake up, Neo!\")\n\nMahayana Buddhism suggests that there are great spiritual warriors (like Neo?) who are walking the path from ignorance to enlightenment, and who can in turn guide us on the path."

Now, most people think this film is intelligent, but I thought that is was incredibly long and was almost entirely plotless. It's a shame at how the characters act so serious that you don't know what they are talking about. Another problem I have with the Matrix were the incredibly overrated effects. First of all, I can't understand why the Matrix won the Visual Effects Oscar over the Phantom Menace, which took much more effort and used much more technology. I see so many unoriginalities with the Matrix's effects. People who think that the Bullet Time effects were original and told the story, you obviously haven't seen the slow-motion bullets in Face/Off, which I personally found more eye-catching. And for people who think that the story about a computer programmer entering a virtual reality world, you obviously haven't seen the Walt Disney masterpiece Tron, which, by the way, had far more groundbreaking technology for its day than the Matrix's effects had when it was first made. Overall, the Matrix is one of the most overrated films I've ever seen and had more attention than it actually deserved. Grade: D"

There's \"great\" and then there's The Matrix level. Let's be real-this movie is an 11/10 because it took everything we thought we knew about action, philosophy, and filmmaking and turned it upside down.\n\nKeanu Reeves as Neo? Absolute perfection. He starts off as a regular dude stuck in the system, and by the end, he's out here dodging bullets in slow motion, questioning reality, and literally becoming \"The One.\" It's impossible not to root for Neo as he navigates the layers of this dystopian world, and Reeves' iconic coolness makes the whole journey legendary.\n\nThe action scenes? Next level. From the mind-blowing bullet-dodging scene to that rooftop battle, the Wachowskis changed the game with their insane choreography and visuals. Slow-motion, 360-degree camera spins, martial arts that feel like poetry-this is the movie that made us all want to learn kung fu (or at least pretend we could).\n\nBut what really makes The Matrix more than just a sick action flick is the story. The whole concept of questioning reality, breaking free from the system, and figuring out who you really are? It's the ultimate \"wake-up call\" movie. It's got layers on layers of philosophy, tech paranoia, and human struggle that hit hard, even years later.\n\nAnd let's talk about the supporting cast-Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus is the mentor we all wish we had, and Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity? She's a badass from start to finish, breaking stereotypes and just oozing confidence and skill in every fight scene.\n\nVisually, The Matrix is still ahead of its time. The green coding, the dystopian cityscapes, the machines-it all blends seamlessly with the mind-bending plot, and it still looks SO clean today. Every frame feels iconic.\n\nThe soundtrack? Straight fire. Rage Against the Machine's Wake Up closing out the film? Chef's kiss. Every song fuels the adrenaline and tension, making the entire experience feel epic.\n\nThe Matrix isn't just a film, it's a full-on experience. It makes you question reality while delivering some of the best action scenes ever filmed. 11/10 because it's the ultimate sci-fi action movie that blew everyone's mind and keeps doing it, no matter how many times you watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "Every so often a movie will come around to challenge the minds of the people; make people think, \"What if...\" \"The Matrix\" was such a movie. \"The Matrix\" took an idea that was not entirely original and took it to another level. The concept of machines rebelling against their human creators had already been explored in successful movies such as \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" and \"Terminator\", but never had a movie dabbled with the idea of machines being triumphant and eventually enslaving all of humankind.\n\n\"The Matrix\" as a story alone was extraordinary. The Wachowski brothers obviously put a lot of thought, time, and energy into the story alone because it is without equal. The story itself triggered thoughts of \"What if we are plugged into a matrix? How would we know?\" And it also spawned many contemplative conversations all over the country if not the world. The Wachowski Brothers covered even the most minute detail with regards to the matrix: its origin, its function, its current state, and it flaws. Each scene and each conversation seemed to be carefully chosen and put together so as to convey the plausibility of the matrix.\n\nThen coupled with the great story was almost equally fantastic directing and special effects. Before \"The Matrix\" none had tried or adequately tried the still shot and pan. Almost immediately into the movie we get to see a shot of Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) jumping in the air, then being frozen perfectly still while the camera pans around her, before she proceeds to kick butt. This movie had no shortage of special effects and action blended it perfectly with critical and revealing dialogue."

It's is a masterpiece in it's own way. It's not for everyone as the idea itself is only for particular type of movie fans.\n\nThis is a movie way ahead of it's time. It's still a better movie than most of the movies we got to see in 2020 which had better technology! Some of the effects are way cooler than many recent movies. The action sequences use way better CGI than any recent movies we saw in 2020 or any other recent movies. It's full action packed and the effects they used is way ahead of their time.\n\nRecommending this to be added to your must have must watchlist."

        "review_detailed_main": "As the world and the movies head into a brand new millenium, old narrative formats have been gilded with all the techno/cyber concepts and jargon that now inundate us in our daily lives. In no areas of filmmaking is this more true than the action/adventure and sci-fi genres. Probably the most popular example to date comes in the form of \"The Matrix\", a film that actually chooses as its setting a never-never land located somewhere between reality and the abstract plane of cybernetics.\n\nThe plot of the film, though too complex to reiterate here, is actually put forward in a fairly straightforward, comprehensible manner. What is missing from the film is the essential grounding in reality that makes the audience care if the main characters succeed in their mission (to rescue the world of course) or fail. Unlike say \"Enemy of the State\", which managed to grapple with the potential dangers of an over-computerized and mechanized society in a world with which we are all familiar, \"The Matrix\" takes us to a sci-fi world that never fully engages the audience in even its own reality. Part of the problem may be that the film's visual designers settle for the conventional sci-fi view of the future world as a series of dark, cramped, fog enshrouded rooms and corridors familiar to us from countless such movies. We follow the obviously well thought-out and meticulously explained storyline but find ourselves never particularly engaged in the characters or feel any stake in the outcome of the final resolution. As to the film's much vaunted special effects, they are, admittedly at times, intriguing, but since computer graphics now make even the most preposterous situations possible on the screen, the audience craves more than simply scattered moments of jawdropping visuals to engage its full attention. \"The Matrix\" borders on dullness quite often during its overlong 136 minute running time. Perhaps a movie that takes place in a world that really isn't a world needs a more engaging central character to make the audience care."

        "review_detailed_main": "Years ago, when I was in grade 10, we watched this in ethics class. My teacher Mrs. Kosiol proudly announced that she had interpreted how the Matrix was inspired by Plato's cave allegory before the maker of this movie mentioned it.\n\nI just rewatched it mostly because I don't remember everything in the movie and want to watch its sequels. The first half of the movie really had me. All these ideas must have been so revolutionary for 1999 and surely defined parts of film-making. Some ideas like AIs and humans destroying the planet seem overused nowadays but for 1999 this is a remarkable movie.\n\nI really like the matrix idea. As my teacher said, it really is like Plato's allegory and it's interesting and scary to think about what were if the matrix was actually true. The idea also reminded me of the Infinite Tsukuyomi from Naruto. I wonder if Kishimoto was inspired by the matrix.\n\nSo the first half really had me and I kinda wanted to like this movie but so many points just destroyed the feel for me. Especially the second half was pretty boring and absurd.\n\nWith such an intriguing idea as the matrix, why does there have to be all those fight scenes? Why does there have to be hand-to-hand combat and gunshots and what-not? Maybe that generates more viewership in the cinema but for me it really didn't fit the scene.\n\nAnd then the very ending, like what was that? Why does Trinity have to wait so long and tell Neo something almost meaningless in front of the phone booth? For god sake, just get out and then you have all the time in the world to say whatever you want.\n\nIt was all to set up some romance between Neo and Trinity. But I ask you: Why?! This was so forced and at no point of the movie it seemed like there would be a romantic relationship arising between them. It was romance just for the sake of a Hollywood kiss.\n\nAnd then there is Neo. How flat can a character be? This guy has absolutely no personality besides being the one. And him going back in to save Morpheus also just doesn't fit his personality, it is a forced superhero behaviour. Then, at the end he just randomly becomes overpowered for no reason at all. Oh, I guess there is a reason - the power of love. How clich\u00e9.\n\nHe starts flexing and fighting one-handed but man just get the **** out of the matrix. We don't even know what these people see in Neo. Why was he chosen? His hacker personality seems to have almost no impact at all. Neo is really one of the worst written characters I've seen recently.\n\nIt's a revolutionary movie that you should have seen to experience the idea of the matrix. But other than these ideas, it is not too watch-worthy."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Matrix is a stunning, fast paced movie with lots of great special effects, high action, and a great soundtrack.\n\nBut...is that all it is?\n\nNo. It isn't.\n\nWhen I listen to people talk about this movie, or read reviews by people who don't like it, the main problem they seem to have is the the plot, which they claim is mind-numbing, inaccessible, or just plain dumb. They claim that the reason the movie is so popular is because if the special effects.\n\nThose who make these claims are just a little clueless, and the true art of storytelling is lost on them.\n\nHere's why. Every story that we see on screen, read in a book or on the web has been told before in one fashion or another. \"Jurassic Park\" is nothing more than a retelling of \"Frankenstein\" when you get right down to it. What catches our attention is when the story is re-told in such a different light that we like the retelling without really being called back to an earlier version. The \"Jurassic Park example can work again for this point. No one sees it as another retelling of \"Frankenstein\" at all, or at least, they don't dwell on the issue. Shakespeare didn't create any stories....he borrowed from other texts, used other sources, and used words to his advantage. The whole thing involves what is called \"intertextuality\", a term that I won't go into here, but is what I am trying to explain in the brief example of \"Jurassic Park.\"\n\nOkay, stop yawning.\n\nNow, the Matrix has done the same thing, and what is funny is that very, very few people have recognized the major source of the story ( I wonder if the writers really know ). I have heard that it is supposed to be Christian themed, and while there is some imagery in that respect, like a character named Trinity, Neo's death and rebirth at the end of the movie, the ship's name, etc. etc. etc., the list can go on. But it has nothing to do with the story, which borrows very heavily from a philosophy written by Plato, of all people, back when the years were still labeled as BC.\n\nPlato wrote a philosophy, the actual name escapes me, but I keep hearing it referred to as \"The Cave.\" In this philosophy on the workings of a society, Plato stated that if you were to take four people from the day they were born, tie them to chairs so that their heads cannot move, and place them in the back of a cave where they cannot see the opening, nor have any daylight. They only have contact with each other. Now, on the wall that they are facing, they can see shadows moving, be it a shadow puppet play, or whatever you can imagine, but all they see are those shadows. You leave them in this cave for 20 years. The only life that they know is the chair, and the playing of shadows on the wall. They will not know the shadows are merely shadows, nor will they know the idea of freedom, and they will now know anything of the real world. Then, you release one man, let him wander the world for awhile. He sees that the world isn't just shadows on a wall, etc etc. If you put him back in the cave, he will not view the shadows the same way that he once did. He will also try to enlighten the other three that the images on the wall are only shadows, and that there is a beautiful and colorful world outside their cave. But they will not believe him, and will even begin to see him as a blasphemer, and an enemy.\n\nWHEW!!\n\nThat's the basic story in the Matrix. Neo has been removed from the cave, and has seen the real world, and now knows he has been seeing shadows his entire life, and his mission is to make humanity realize that they are seeing shadows as well, but until that time, he will be regarded as an enemy by those still inside the cave. The agents are the keepers of the cave, and the Matrix itself is the shadows that we see. When you see this connection, the story can make more sense to those who can't quite understand it.\n\nAnd so by blending old, old stories with modern filming techniques and great acting by all involved and fast paced action, there is something to be said about this movie being a work of art, because it truly is."

        "review_title": "The most influential and refreshing science-fiction movie since \"Star Wars\".",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Matrix\" has redefined the science-fiction genre. Previous to this movie, most science-fiction movies consisted out of scene's in space with spacecrafts, aliens, all set in a futuristic world. Most movies that tried to be different from this, mostly failed. \"The Matrix\" does however does not fail and it redefined the science-fiction genre and has taken it to a whole different and more seriously taken level of movie-making. The movie has inspired many different movies ever since and showed that science-fiction and action elements are a great and spectacular combination. From that perspective \"The Matrix\" is one of the most important movies for film-making, from the '90's.\n\nThis is a superb piece of movie-making. The Wachowski 'brothers' were obviously inspired by the Japanese anime style and they transform that style spectacularly into a life-action movie. Because of the style and flair of the movie, it makes the action look spectacular and even also look as something totally new. The fantastic bullet-time effects were something unseen before and are already alone reason enough why this movie is already almost a classic and certainly unforgettable movie. The style and new effects used in the movie make this movie to be also a refreshing one. It's an extremely original movie, both story-wise and technique-wise.\n\nEspecially the action is what truly makes this movie a success. The fight and action sequences are beautifully choreographed. It also all is beautifully shot by cinematographer Bill Pope, who uses some fantastic lighting and camera-angles at times. The musical score from Don Davis is also quite good. Also the costumes and settings most certainly do not disappoint. The special effects are spectacular and also something totally new at times.\n\nThe cast is not the strongest element of the movie. Keanu Reeves is fairly good as the main character but he lacks some charisma at times. Some goes for Carrie-Anne Moss to be honest. Actors who do not disappoint are Laurence Fishburne, Joe Pantoliano and the fantastic Hugo Weaving in his real big breakthrough role. He is an excellent 'villain' because of his look and way of acting.\n\nBut what really makes and shapes the movie is its story. Yes, it's complex and believe, not everything makes sense or is explained in a satisfying way but it at least is something totally original and imaginative. The story really shapes the movie and its style and make the action and science-fiction elements of the movie work fantastically together.\n\nThe movie is great non-stop spectacular action entertaining that doesn't even get slow or boring even when nothing is really happening. This is mainly due to the imaginative powerful story of the movie. If you don't understand and/or get the story the first time, just watch it a second or third time. The movie is worth it. The movie uses multiple layers, symbolism and elements from religions and other styles of movie-making. It makes you discover more new things, every time you watch the movie. One of the most original and influential movies from the '90's and therefor also an absolute must-see!\n\n10/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

Oh, who cares... it looks great!!!).\n\nIn short: with The Matrix, the Wachowski Brothers have given sci-fi fans one of the finest films of the genre ever.\n\nWhat a shame they had to go and make those sequels!"

But like a good video clip does not make the music worth listening to, a whole bunch of special effects do not make a great movie.\n\nAfter watching the Matrix I recognized that:\n\n1. I don't get why super-robots, who overwhelmed the whole human kind, are not able to build some nuclear power plants, despite the fact that they really needn't care about radioactive pollution. Instead they get their energy from humans, and if you take a look at their body \"farms\" you must agree that it looks like they are putting a lot more energy into it than they get out of it... A good movie (even if it's science fiction) should provide some ground level logic in its story.\n\n2. I did not care about the characters. They die? Hmmm, okay. Trinity loves Neo? Uh, why is that? Did I miss something? A good movie makes me feel for the characters and understand their reactions. In this point Matrix is a total failure. Ever watched Brazil? You maybe should if you'd like to see a good \"big brother\" picture.\n\n3. This pseudo religious bla bla. Realize that there is no spoon? I realized that there is something else missing somewhere in the story writers head. Well, wouldn't be so bad, if there weren't point 1 and 2.\n\n4. This background theme of being something better than the others. Uh, am I really just some role playing games liking informatics student? Or am I the master of the universe? Look in the mirror, decide for yourself...does not look like Keanu Reeves? What a surprise.\n\nWatch this movie, it won't bore you. But if you think your going to see a REALLY good movie, or even a masterpiece, keep away from it. You will be quite disappointed afterwards.\n\nAh, and if you like MTV...this is the best movie ever made. ;)\n\n5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I guess everyone has once seen a church service young American denominations-style. It's like female choir is singing, someone's playing synth or guitar, and a priest in front of them shouts \"God is love\", and \"Jesus loves you.\" The lambs shout back these things and all other stuff which is familiar to everyone who has heard something of Christianity.\n\n\"The Matrix\" has very much in common with such ceremonies. An action movie with an original aesthetics and slow motion can be interesting to watch, just like listening to gospels is sometimes an unalloyed pleasure. But the problem about \"The Matrix\" is its annoying sermon. With an incredible solemnity and wannabe-prophetical intonation we're fed with an alloy of the most common places philosophy knows. The famous \"There is no spoon\" phrase - Neo's pupils widen, now he understands everything. A stupid watcher is supposed here to make two or three thinking operations and feel satisfacted for being smart. The intention is simple - or I give too much credit for Wachowskis, maybe this half- philosophy is really the ultimate one for them.\n\nIt's possible to associate solipsism and platonism with a modern virtual reality concept cleverly and softly. Wachowskis, however, do it boldly and pushily. Even the spoon quote is not enough, they also use messiah figure, i.e. Neo himself. Now it's a serious business. Neo's gonna show people what they don't wanna see (quote-unquote). The film starts to fail in amusement at once because Neo hogs the story's blanket; however, film's grandiloquence increases to an unbelievable level.\n\nThus, \"The Matrix\" is an example of movie which is trying to seem what it's not. Wachowskis try to insert their simple story of people in stylish black coats into as many classical contexts as possible: here we have Nebuchdenazzar, and messiah, and also Morpheus, - whilst the ideological concept is more like of a high school student's essay on a subject of philosophy, compiled in one night before deadline. That's what is the word \"tedious\" exists.\n\nNevertheless, it occurred to be the rightest thing. (By the way, effectiveness of such model is well-known: in literature it's exploited by Richard Bach and Paolo Coelho, to name a few.) More than ten years have passed, and still millions of Wachowskis' lambs singing and dancing, and repeating whatever the siblings say. \"There is no spoon,\" chant Wachowskis. \"There is no spoon,\" echoes the congregation deliriously."

Putting together the thinking line of the new generation, where we are just but pawns in a system we don't understand or belong, Matrix also borrows a lot of the oriental culture with the fights and it's inner travel over the nature of Life.\n\nLittle by little one will start to see the light, and everything will make sense. By the second view, you will get a higher conception. By your third view this will amaze you.\n\nBrawn mixed with brains. The Matrix IS the science fiction film. With a perfect script that drowns so profoundly into the true nature of things, and with major, Industrial high tech digital action, I will ask you this if you haven't seen the movie:\n\n-What are you doing reading this instead??"

The story is complex, original, intriguing, and extremely detailed. The characters are all unique and they are all very interesting. The story is full of philosophical questions that make you think and the film is so complex it needs to be watched multiple times.\n\nThe acting is very good. Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Gloria Foster, Joe Pantoliano, Marcus Chong, and many others perform perfectly. Keanu Reeves is a very dry actor. He is very dry in this film but he plays his part well.\n\nThe pacing is perfect and the runtime is perfect.\n\nThe special effects are good even today.\n\nPros: Complex, original, and extremely detailed story, great philosophical questions asked, unique characters, amazing acting, perfect pacing, a good runtime, and amazing special effects\n\nCons: Keanu Reeves is very dry throughout the film\n\nOverall Rating: 9.8"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Matrix is the first installment of a \"trilogy\" of sci-fi movies. In fact, it's not really a trilogy, in an organic sense, it's just a movie and its sequels.\n\nAnyway, \"The Matrix\" is a film with good premises, but bad developments. Although most of the ideas of the film were taken from sci-fi writers of the 60's and philosophers of the past (the idea that we exist as a thought, or a dream, goes back to Plato at least), the script did a good job in putting these ideas together in a modern plot (at least as for year 2000). The oniric influence of recent sci-fi comic books on the film is visible throughout and is what makes the visual appeal of the film.\n\nUnfortunately, what could have been a really good movie has been turned by the W. brothers into an average action flick targetted at 15 year-old boys, among which must belong the guys who wrote this flick is the \"best movie\" they've seen. There is almost no acting, and the heros wearing sunglasses all the time is a good way to avoid any sort of emotion to show on their faces. This total absence of emotion is one of the reasons why nobody gives a f..k whether or not everyone dies in the sequels.\n\nThe W. brothers have a strong tendency to show off : heroes wearing sunglasses and Armani black leather coats designed for yuppies, trendy night-club population, \"bullet time\" special FX, (ugly) kung fu video game action, heavy metal and techno music during the whole film, etc. All this is supposed to make the film look \"kewwwwl\". In opposition to the heros, the agent Smith wears a dark working suit : he is not cool (although he also wears sunglasses, but that's because he is a spy agent).\n\nBut what really turns me off is the pretense of the religioso-philosophico-technobabble which hardly hides the vacuity of the characters and the serious weaknesses of the script. There are so many other films which say much more with less, that this film looks highly overblown in comparison.\n\nI'm not even trying to elaborate on the sequels, which, instead of correcting these problems, show them in their full splendor.\n\nIn a word, this flick is highly overrated. But hey, who cares ? The \"trilogy\" has ripped off enough spectators to make the Warner happy."

Containing a storyline that makes you think and question your own reality to induce questions you might not have thought about before. Every single scene serves its purpose meanwhile every single scene is incredibly thought out, with no unnecessary scenes.\n\nWith incredibly thought out scenes comes beautifully filmed scenes that are nothing less than eye-catching. There are so many scenes that are well done from a film perspective. With beautiful use of colours, to incredibly used angles that manages to capture different feelings.\n\nThe action is nothing short of incredible. The start of the action movies that will come in the 2000s, The Matrix is an inspiration. With awesome action scenes that capture intense fighting, while also keeping you on your toes it's nothing but amazing.\n\nThe Matrix is one of the best movies there is with very little to no negative things to say about it. I highly recommend everyone to watch it with the promise that you won't be disappointed."

Also: the names, Morpheus (Greek God of Sleep), Neo (anagram of \"One\"), Trinity...\n\n\n\nPersonal note: all plots, sub-plots are easy to follow and digest, yet the multi-layered nature of this opus will have you benefiting from a few re-watches. Philosophically, this movie is mature, and deep; to not be too complex for the viewing masses, not too clich\u00e9 and typically Hollywood for the practicing partisans.\n\nNot to even mention this movie created an entire sub-culture, cult following; \"what is the Matrix ?\"."

This was the ride of the decade and brought a new look to the new millennium.\n\nIt's not without some flaws and faults, mainly that the matrix is so complex and complicated that its own concept had to be \"bent and broken\" to allow for some of the story to translate to an acceptable theatrical experience. At least to its targeted mainstream audience. In the hands of a quirky and edgy Director it could have been done with more \"in house logic\", but then it would be quite a different experience.\n\nThe whole concept of a Messiah and \"The One\" is kind of elementary in an extreme exploitation such as this but that only drops it a notch from the best of Sci-Fi and does nothing to hold this exhilarating experience back from being quite entertaining, if on a lesser level."

Everything still holds up and doesn't feel that it has aged too much both visualy and story wise. I watched this movie last time in 2012 and remembered quite a lot of the story watching it again in 2019 but this time I paid more attention to everything.\n\nI want to talk about few aspects of the movie very briefly\n\nThe story. ( Easy to watch, engaging, action packed about a regular guy whose life changes quite drasticly and the growth of becoming the one he never thought he could. Sound design. (Excellent. When I watched all the fight,action scenes the special effects gave a satisfying feedback in my ears when someone landed a punch or got knocked out.) Cinematography (Feels like they thought about everything and it has that special Matrix feel to everything.) Characters (Most m\u00e9morable are Neo which needs no introduction and agent Smith which has a way to intimidate even the viewer and they both are just iconic legends.)\n\nProbably my favourite scenes were the lobby,the rooftop and all the fighting scenes against agent Smith where an underdog just tries anyway even knowing his chances of winning are slim.\n\nTo conclude I would say people in the year 2070 could watch this and it would still hold up. Would I reccomend it? Yes. Will I watch it again ? It's great but I will most likely watch it again in few years after somehow my life leads back to Neo."

None of them do anything to help build or maintain the shock of the original reveal. Rather they just turn in into an odd kinda joke. I really wish I could go back to the theaters and experience that gasp that must have gone through the theater on opening night.\n\nI wish I had been as blown away as all those people who experienced it the first time.\n\nAll I though was, 'Huh.'

The stupid, faux philosophy about different realities was clearly ripped from a film called Dark City, which was far more chilling and unhinged, and managed to steer clear of the juvenile philosophical clap-trap that infected The Matrix (even the title is lame).\n\nIts only saving grace was some innovatory and influential action sequences and a good Don Davis score.But the action eventually seemed to contrive to divert the viewer from the paucity of original ideas exhibited, and culminated in a ridiculous, Dodge City-style shoot 'em up that had me laughing out loud. Then Neo turns into Superman: yep,s-o-o-o original. Then there's the bit where Neo is resurrected by the kiss by Trinity. It's ET and Snow White and every other now-predictable clich\u00e9 in the cannon of story telling. To top that Fishburne's character whispers in hushed awe: \"He's The One\". I would have laughed if it wasn't so pathetic.\n\nIn another comment someone described this and the sci-fi benchmark for all others to follow. Excuse me?! Show some me actual science in this muddled subterranean labyrinth, then I might reconsider. I won't even comment on the ensuing two movies,with the preposterous Christ fixation that dominated the third. Horrible, style-over-content rubbish."

        "review_detailed_main": "25TH ANNIVERSARY THEATRICAL RE-RELEASE REVIEW - Let me tell you what I believe. I believe that this is cinema. It was cinema back then in 1999, and 25 years later in the year 2024, it's still cinema. There are many great films out there, and I've given some of them a 10/10. However, if there's 1 film that stands above them all, it's The Matrix - my favorite film of all time. I think I had already seen it 5 times, and for my 6th time, I finally saw it in a movie theater. The film really shows that no matter what kind of world we live in, we can make our own choices. Some of them may be good or bad, but there's still that freedom of thought...which can be freedom of action - or in my case, the freedom of telling people that The Matrix is my favorite film of all time even when flaws are pointed out. Pretty much every film I've seen has flaws like \"why can't they suddenly do that thing?\" or \"why is this subplot randomly added?\" The Matrix is no different, but it's still something very special and easily a timeless classic. Score: 10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've heard a lot about this movie over the years, but I never got around to watching it until now. I finally did, and I have to say-it was absolutely amazing! I really didn't expect it to be the kind of movie that it turned out to be, but I was pleasantly surprised in the best way possible.\n\nAt first, the plot was a bit confusing, especially in the beginning, but that's totally normal. We, as the audience, know just as much as Neo (played by Keanu Reeves) at that point, so the confusion is intentional. But once everything starts to make sense, it's incredibly satisfying. The whole concept behind the movie is really unique, and it definitely makes you stop and think-what if the world actually worked like this?\n\nThe practical effects are seriously impressive, and even the CGI still holds up remarkably well, especially considering the movie was made in 1999. It's clear a lot of care and attention to detail went into making everything look as cool as it does.\n\nAll the action scenes are spectacular, but that final act? Wow! It's one of the most entertaining and exhilarating things I've watched in a long time. And let's not forget about the soundtrack-the music is incredible and really adds to the overall experience.\n\nOverall, this movie is an easy 5/5 for me. Everything about it-from the story to the action to the effects-was just spot-on. I can't wait to see if the sequels live up to the standard set by this one."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Matrix defines Y2K sci-fi action. Its special effects are most notable because a combination of CGI and practical gives the film a dreamlike, yet grounded feel. Plenty of action is enhanced by effects in The Matrix, but the highlight has to be the shootout in the lobby because it is done without CGI. Painstaking work was put into actually dismantling that lobby and it paid off. Next, the production design of The Matrix builds a sleek world of green hues and leather jackets that still inspires aesthetics today. The dystopian future is appropriately bleak while the computer world is appropriately polished.\n\nMeanwhile, The Matrix has dynamic camerawork. Its use of the bullet time effect has become synonymous with the film and is even known as \"the Matrix effect\". The sound design is surreal and the music is borderline iconic. The story is philosophical and trippy. Lastly, the direction is wonderful because The Matrix has such a precise style. Its combination of eastern and western action, its slick fashion, and its futuristic visuals create an experience that cannot be replicated. Because The Matrix is jam-packed with so much excitement, flair, and abstraction, it is a generational experience.\n\nWriting: 9/10 Direction: 10/10 Cinematography: 9/10 Acting: 8/10 Editing: 8/10 Sound: 9/10 Score/Soundtrack: 9/10 Production Design: 10/10 Casting: 8/10 Effects: 10/10\n\nOverall Score: 9.0/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "I made every effort to be open minded about \"The Matrix.\" I put aside such questions as \"Why does Hollywood see Keanu as a cyberpunk? How came everyone is making making a big deal about these fx which you can see in shampoo commercials?\" I can honestly say I gave it every chance. The fact that the creators were trying to create fully developed worldview was admirable, and the movies surprises hadn't yet been revealed.\n\nSo as the movie rolled, and I got too see one of the worst, most painful movies I have ever seen, I could honestly say it wasn't me. I enjoy scifi and Hong Kong films, enjoy Philip K. Dick, so I was basically the ideal audience for this film.\n\nThe plot was so full of loopholes, maintaining suspension of disbelief was impossible. Except for one or two supporting cast members, the acting was lifeless, and the action was unsupported by any motivation. The antagonists were far more sympathetic than the protagonists, whose cold-blooded killing sprees did nothing to endear them to me. Finally the washed out lighting and coloring took away a lot of depth from the images.. when someone seems to leap from building to building, if the buildings look collapsed together, it's not that impressive.\n\nAnd the fighting.. when you watch Jet Li or Jackie Chan fight, even when they are obviously assisted by wires, you feel an exhilaration at what they are physically capable of doing. The fights flow, and the character is maintained through out. In The Matirx, there is no real joy or sense of exertion. People punch each other, pull some interesting feats, but without any sense of risk or accomplishment.\n\nWhat people saw in this waste of film, time and money, I do not know. But I include it with the American remake of Godzilla as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. If you want Phillip K. Dick reality warping, see Blade Runner. If you want good cyberpunk anime, see Akira or Ghost in The Shell, or for martial arts, a good Bruce Lee or Hong Kong flick.\n\nBut don't waste your time on this."

Directed by the Wachowskis, this film brilliantly blends philosophical questions with groundbreaking visual effects, creating an immersive experience that challenges viewers' perceptions of reality.\n\nThe story follows Neo (Keanu Reeves), a hacker who discovers that the world he knows is an elaborate simulation created by machines to subdue humanity. As he joins a group of rebels led by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), Neo embarks on a journey to free the human race from this artificial prison.\n\nThe film's visual effects, particularly the \"bullet time\" sequences, revolutionized action cinema and set new standards for what was possible in filmmaking. The iconic green-tinted digital world and the stark contrast between the simulated and real worlds are visually stunning and symbolically rich.\n\n\"The Matrix\" is more than just an action-packed spectacle; it delves into profound themes such as free will, reality, and the nature of existence. Its philosophical underpinnings, inspired by thinkers like Descartes and Baudrillard, invite viewers to question the very fabric of their own lives.\n\nKeanu Reeves delivers a career-defining performance as Neo, perfectly capturing the character's transformation from a confused hacker to a confident savior. The supporting cast, including Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity and Hugo Weaving as the menacing Agent Smith, also shine in their respective roles.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Matrix\" is a thought-provoking and visually stunning film that continues to resonate with audiences two decades after its release. It is a timeless exploration of reality and perception, and a must-see for anyone who appreciates cinema that challenges the mind while dazzling the senses."

In 2003 a lit bit older i rewatched as a study in a philosophy class. And that i just remarckble. After that day it opened my mind to many aspects in films and moviemaking. First for the movies itself ( the oracle and its messages, the pils, the Matrix itself and its meaning). And of course, .this broadened my vision of film interpretation, not just in the Matrix itself, but ignited my perception as whole and after that i become a lover of the seventh art, In short, I liked Matrix Iwhen I was 12 years old, and I loved it when I was older and could really understand it (or thought I did). The perfect mix of sci-fi, philosophy, action, a perfect mix of cult and mainstream movie, a real masterpiece.\n\nFor all the meaning that this movie has in my life i would say that its ( of course in my opinion) the best movie the human kind did."

The Wachowski's simply knocked it out of the park when it came to the visuals.\n\nKeanu Reeves is Mr Anderson an ordinary computer programmer by day and secret hacker called Neo at night who is suddenly pursued by government agents led by a sinister Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) after he is contacted by computer hacker Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne.)\n\nMorpheus believes Neo is the 'One.' Humans lives in a false reality that controls humans and Neo will lead the harvested humans to rebel against the machines creating the false reality.\n\nThe film mixes cyberpunk science fiction with Hong Kong style martial arts and elements of Japanese manga type animation as inspiration.\n\nKeanu Reeves is in his element in a world where he does not understand what is around him. He looks cool and does well in the martial arts sequences. I guess revisiting this genre made up for the failure of Johnny Mnemonic.\n\nLaurence Fishburne is even more cooler as Morpheus guiding Neo in this hostile new reality and how to take down the system. Carrie-Anne Moss is kick ass sexy in black leather as Trinity who displays superhuman powers.\n\nThe film has philosophical underpinnings as the Wachowski's ask us to think about the world around us and our place within it.\n\nThe subtext of the film can be re-analysed in light of the personal journeys of the Wachowskis. Change and transformation. It is laughable to see the right wing attempting to co-opt the movie for their own agenda.\n\nThe film is cool, it is hip but I felt slightly too long and little bit too po faced. However the Wachowskis did manage to catch lightning in a bottle which they did not manage to do with the following two sequels."

The whole thing is based on special effects. It's a film by two directors that think half of the cameras running at 300 fps is art...or something.\n\nHugo Weaving has the only good performance in this movie as Agent Smith. Carrie Anne Moss is bland as can be. Do I even have to comment on Keanu Reeves....dude...woah...nuff said.\n\nThis is the perfect example of Joel Silver run amuck. Just because you have money to produce movies, doesn't mean you should produce bad movies....sounds pretty obvious to me. I'm just so thankful when I see someone like Steven Spielberg putting out a movie like Minority Report...a movie (actually...a director and crew) that knows how to USE special effects to drive a story. Not just shoot the hell out of a government building...hmmmm...not such a great scene to slip in there now, huh?\n\nSo, to everyone involved in The Matrix...give up your black leather, gun toting, world-is-an-illusion, horrible filmmaking and go put your money to good use...like film school."

The combination of overt philosophy, -- ranging from Plato's cave to Descartes' intellectual autonomy-- cyberpunk aesthetic, and balls to the wall action is utilized so well. It shouldn't work at all, but it does. Now the film isn't perfect by any means: Trinity is reduced in the second half of the movie to character on standby mode and while the ending is cool, it leaves the viewer with too many questions that have to be lazily answered in a sequel."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Wachowski Brothers enjoy action movies, but like the rest of us, realized that most of those made by Hollywood in the last dozen years or so have been basically mindless, however entertaining they are in other ways.\n\nSo they wrote THE MATRIX -- actually, before they wrote BOUND -- and had a hard time selling it. No wonder. It's furiously intelligent, very serious but with an undertone of dark comedy that makes it different from all other action movies. While clearly influenced by movies like BLADE RUNNER and ALIEN/ALIENS, they've also clearly been jazzed by comic books, cyber-science fiction of the William Gibson school, Hong Kong action movies and Japanese anime, as well as classic Hollywood films noir.\n\nBut while they're clearly influenced by this heady stew, they've stirred into something fresh and original, and provided a back story so rich that dozens of other stories could be set in this same universe without ever getting around to actually doing a sequel to THIS story.\n\nKeanu-bashers will be deeply disappointed, because Reeves is terrific here, as is the rest of the cast, including the ultra-cool Laurence Fishburne. But the standout performance comes from Hugo Weaving as the head bad guy; it's hard to believe he played the leading role in THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT."

        "review_title": "Amazing Movie Ever!!!",
        "review_detailed_main": "The Matrix Is one of the best Classic Sci-Fi Action Film ever !\n\nIt depicts a dystopia future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called \"the Matrix\", created by sentient machines to subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. Computer programmer \"Neo\" learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, which involves other people who have been freed from the \"dream world\".\n\nWritten and directed by the Wachowski brothers, this classic sci-fi action film stars Keanu Reeves as a lowly computer programmer who discovers his entire existence, and that of all mankind, is nothing but a simulation in a computer. The reality within a reality is a concept that's done before... but never like this - The Matrix requires absolute attention from his audience, least you'll be completely lost in a few minutes. With the help of supporting cast members Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne-Moss, Reeves discovers that inside this simulation environment known as The Matrix, he can control, bend, and manipulate space-time... resulting in some of the most incredibly iconic images to ever grace the silver screen.\n\nThe slow-motion \"bullet-time\" effects as they're known today were groundbreaking and revolutionary when we first saw them 12 years ago. Although Reeves is notorious for his inability to really convey much emotional range, his character here lends itself well to him as an actor. This is a movie that makes you think, makes you gasp, and makes totally forget where the 136-minutes went after finishing it. It's no wonder this film spawned two very successful sequels, and dozens of copy-cats. The Matrix, \"Visually revolutionary, and mind-blowing.\"\n\nKeanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix. He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting.\n\nCarrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. He also played the roles in Underrated Daredevil (2003)and Bad Boys I & II. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job.\n\nThe best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor. Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.\n\nEffects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopia atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly."

Truly, it's an incredible experience."

The cast of Matrix was chosen perfectly in my opinion, and the lead by Keanu Reeves is a 10/10 perfect performance. This is definitely one of the best movies I ever saw in my life and I hold it very dear to my heart. The soundtrack is a perfect match with the tone of the movie."

Where in the world did they find actors so badly on par with Keanu Reeves? Amongst the 'pretty boy' actors in Hollywood, he is the prince of the wood face. Clint Eastwood may have more expression. All of the actors, with the possible exception of Larry Fishburn, who I have seen in other roles that were good, are as stiff as a corpse. None of Neo's pals need to be in this film. They are totally uninteresting and unnecessary. Apoc? Switch? Mouse? Why? These people have the personalities of a smock. At least the two brothers serve the purpose of getting them in and out of the Matrix and driving the ship. The others are there to look good, and they missed on that too.\n\nAnd why so much needless violence? All these 'cops' they kill are just people suppossedly stuck in that gooey jell you get out of the 25 cent vending machines, right? So, Neo and his babe go around and kill a bunch of helpless, innocent people. Those guys were just minding their own biz when they burst in with an arsenal that rivals that of Rick James's.\n\nAnd then there are the scary characters. They range from the emotionless 'smiths' to that of those creepy kids who bent spoons and made me wax sentimental about unicef for some reason. In fact, the Smiths were the best 'acted' roles, but I think that's because they had the least to stretch since they were the bad guys.\n\nI can't even get into the plot holes, since there is a word limit, but there were a lot. This whole movie is beyond improbable. But, it's worth a viewing or 2. Check it out if you got a friend who wants to blow there money one saturday night."

        "review_detailed_main": "The good: The action scenes involving guns are original. The \"frozen moment\" camera effect is well done.\n\nThe bad: The script is uneven and horribly horribly written. I mean Saturday morning cartoons are better written than this, not even good cartoons either, I think that the average episode of Voltron or Scooby Doo have more meaningful and profound scripts. The main characters can't even manage to be two dimensional.\n\nThe ugly: The acting is hideous, and I'm not just talking about the spoken lines. I can almost hear Keanu saying \"dude\" after every line. Fishburne is also attains a whole new level of corniness, Mumra on Thundercats levels of melodrama. As in another over-hyped movie, Crouching Tiger etc. etc., no amount of special effects can disguise the fact that these people do not know martial arts. The fight scene between Fishburne and Reeves made me laugh out loud, and not in a happy way, more of a \"I can't believe how pathetic this is\" kind of defensive laugh. Hong Kong movies made in the late seventies have better wirework. The cookie cutter villain is actually the most compelling character, and that my friends is sad.\n\nThis is what really makes me nauseous: Two more movies are coming out. Umm... did I miss something here? I thought that the movie's only redeeming quality was the \"surprise\" midway through when we found out what \"The Matrix\" was. There's not much sequel material here to work with.\n\nThe first half of this movie is decent in that it doesn't really insult the viewer. As soon as Reeves wakes up in the tank, the movie becomes a laughable, pretentious Saturday morning cartoon. Junior high kids should eat it up, but any reasonably intelligent person who has read a book in his or her life will take absolutely nothing from this move of any lasting value. A truly mind-numbing movie."

With their chilling, dark film \"Bound\", which they directed and written, I knew I was going to expect another fantastic presentation. \"The Matrix\" completely blew me away.\n\nI got the announcement about this film over three years ago, and I was curious to see what \"The Matrix\" really was, but information was far too limited, leaving me only the names of the people behind the magic. However, it creeped up through the neighborhood and slapped me in the face, yelling, \"Damnit! Look at me!\" Look at it I did, and I am stilling pondering about \"The Matrix.\"\n\n\"The Matrix\" stars Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburn, Carrie-Ann Moss, and Joe Pantoliano, among others. I have tracked Fishburn's acting career since his infamous role on \"Pee Wee's Playhouse\" as \"Cowboy Curtis,\" and I must say, I am amazed once again. Fishburn with the rest of the actors/actresses perform stunningly, and leave you wanting more.\n\nBut what is this Matrix I keep rambling on about? Well, as Fishburn states, \"Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself.\" That is exactly what you need to do to decipher \"The Matrix.\"\n\nAlthough I promised myself not to let out too much information on this film, I have permitted myself to blabber on about what this film has done. It has done far past my expectations in technology. The slick movements by the characters, and the martial arts are amazing. Obviously, a lot of work has been put into this film, and work has done it good.\n\nAnother point about this film that may be brought to your surprise. The actual fight scenes, twirling about, action scenes, and so on, were conducted by the actors themselves, not stuntmen, which also adds another nice touch to realism. The training that the actors must have gone through has to be appreciated from this film.\n\nNow, after viewing this film, you may decide, \"Oh jeez. I thought I was in for something. This is just another Hollywood show-off of an old, repetitive storyline.\" Well, may-be, but \"The Matrix\" has an insightful and nice touch to its storyline. It brings it out in a unique way that no film has brought before. That is why it stands out.\n\n\"The Matrix\" is a marvel among movies. This may not get an Oscar or two, but it definitely stands out among other films. \"The Matrix\" cannot be explained unless seen, so for you to discover the mystery behind \"The Matrix\", you have to see it, to believe it."

It simply has so much to offer... all that food for thought, different beliefs, tons of themes that are explored and such immense room for interpretation, with very little in this being certain or definite. The plot is excellent, develops well, and combines various interesting ideas(and no, they weren't original, they weren't meant to be... this puts a lot of fascinating concepts together, and presents them all for the mainstream audience). Granted, it spawned a ton of suddenly enlightened pocket philosophers with little doubt as to their own prowess, but with anything this influential, there are going to be some negative results. The pacing is spot-on, not a moment of this is too long or overly short. The action is astounding, exciting, fun, entertaining and awesome, and they manage to do amazing and memorable sequences. No, perhaps it does not dodge all of the clich\u00e9s. The slow-motion(and bits clearly inspired by John Woo) and other tools appeared before this, yes, the point isn't that they were new... it's the way this uses them, and creates a unique style. Mixing Noir, Anim\u00e9 and countless allusions, and doing so with expert-like skill is an impressive feat. The Bullet-Time was invented for this, and it is fantastic. The martial arts, the choreography, the moves, magnificent. The effects are stunning and seamless, to this day. The cinematography and editing are perfect, and enormously well-planned. The mood and atmosphere is masterfully achieved. The acting is quite good, Reeves fits, Moss and Fishburne are marvelous, and Weaving is utterly impeccable. The dialog is almost completely invariably well-written, and well-delivered. There is no nudity or sexuality, at most hints thereof. There is language, moderately harsh, albeit not too bad in frequency. The DVD holds a text introduction(to the following) by the Wachowski's, that makes for a great read, as well as two commentary tracks, one of philosophers who enjoyed the film, Dr. Cornel West & Ken Wilder, and one of critics who did not care for it, Todd McCarthy, John Powers & David Thompson. These are worth listening to. I recommend this to any fan of science fiction, and anyone who wishes to be encouraged to think by what they watch. 10/10"

Morpheus thinks that Neo is \"The One\" which means that this person would be very strong and can dodge bullets and do wild stuff like that.\n\nThe reason so many people loved this movie was because it was so out of this world and no one else not even Mr.Spielberg could have done this movie because only two brothers could have brought this to life and made one of the best sci-fi sagas ever made(tied with the \"Alien\" saga) and make remembered through generations, so i hope when i get old this movie will still be remembered because it is simply amazing."

Neo (Keanu Reeves)was my idol, and I hope one day I can be as great as he was in this film!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw this movie last night on German TV, and there must be something to it, because after I went to bed I dreamt I myself was caught in the Matrix, trying to convince Morpheus that an unexpected intruder to his ship was benign and ending up as Morpheus's secretary. Possibly it is the dreamlike quality of the movie that makes it a classic. There are some scenes visually compelling, if not really beautiful (e.g. the green insect penetrating Neo's body). But the excessive martial arts sequences were at first annoying and then, as they became more frequent, I was just bored by them (just as in Charlie's Angels, if this comparison is politically correct). Obviously martial arts are fashionable, but I never cared for Bruce Lee either. In general, The Matrix forgot about its lofty aspirations as it drew towards its end, turning into a plain action movie with endless special effects, fireworks, shooting, and all, even with a helicopter. But what about the very idea of the Matrix? Isn't it just nonsense? After all, if machines took control of the world, using human beings as \"batteries,\" these machines could easily put the poor humans into a perpetual coma, leaving them without consciousness, a state in which they would even spend less energy to sustain themselves, making the whole thing more efficient for the machines. Such human beings would not need any surrogate reality; the Matrix, which is not only a complex box of tricks, but also a waste of energy, would become obsolete."

While being perfectly casted with Keanu Reeves playing NEO, and Carrie-Anne Moss playing Trinity, while leaving the boss himself in the middle of it all, Laurence Fishburne playing Morpheus.

        "review_detailed_main": "The Matrix came out in 1999 for almost 23 years ago, but the vfx is still pretty good, the movie wasn't supposed to be the biggest thing but still looked nice. It has this unique green tint that some may say looks bad, but that makes the movie look unique compared to other movies. If you have watched the 4th installment witch came out X-mas 2021, you can see that the tint is gone and it don't look like a matrix film, even do it was created 22 years after the 1st one, it looks out of place, so the tint is a great thing.\n\nThe music, is great and has this sci-fi theme mixed with great action music witch brings back memories of Terminator 2. The music works great with the great performances of all the actors & the well choreographed fights. There are some nice action scenes and then towards the end it's all action. There is so much variation in the fights aswell, it isn't just a small area the characters fight for a long time, but the last almost hour of the film is just one big pile of action that still has variation whiles being fluent.\n\nThe story and concept is also pretty interesting and the movie and the whole franchise really shows the concept in an deep way.\n\nAnother great thing is the characters that all get love, the antagonist is also awesome, agent smith is a great villain even do you only see him in a black suit with glasses most of the time, at least the suit always stays on. The movie also manages to have little to no boring scenes, many movies have to explain something's and most movies like to balance the explaining throughout the experience, some movies no matter how good have some of those boring scenes that are necessary and understandable to have in the film if the audience is going to understand the story being told. The scenes that have som explaining still feel good, you might feel a tiny bit bored but it just gets more and more exiting and you don't feel bored at all, it's kinda hard to explain with words.\n\nAt the end of the day, an iconic sci-if movie with great everything and also if you made it this far I hope you have a great day and:\n\nUnfortunately, no one can be told what The Matrix is. You'll have to see it for yourself."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have heard so much about the Matrix and finally watched it for the first time this weekend.\n\nBoy, were there lots of action sequences. Lots and lots and lots of action sequences. You can feel the filmmakers just trying to top the last sequence instead of doing something like advancing the plot or developing the characters. Unless you think the action sequence is the be-all-and-end-all of movies, all that action just gets boring after a while. I have nothing against whiz-bang special effects as long as they do something worthwhile to move the film along (the Lord of the Rings films are good at this). But this is just not happening with the Matrix.\n\nThe Matrix concept itself is thought-provoking. Why isn't it developed more? The fact that this monumental struggle for the soul of humanity ends up with a shoot-out, a helicopter-dangling rescue sequence and a martial arts fight is almost laughable. It's like saying the mysteries of the universe can be unraveled by watching beer commercials. If you want to see an ending that leaves you with something worth chewing on, you'll be sadly disappointed (as I was).\n\nAs for other elements of the movie -- Keanu Reeves, as much as I usually enjoy watching him, was extremely wooden. Fishburne and Moss were good at what they did, but their parts were pretty two-dimensional. I couldn't get emotionally involved with any of the characters, which is ultimately the fault of the writers. The cinematography and \"style\" of the film and the sets is pretty cool to look at. However, the whole black clothes and sunglasses motif is just a little bit hokey after a while. And the agents -- I swear they look just like the bad aliens in Brother From Another Planet -- I kept expecting them to shriek at each other.\n\nI look at it this way - people who think that sitting in front of their tubes and playing video games is a worthwhile way to spend their lives will probably love this movie. People who want something more will think it's pretty hollow. It's a shame because the concept had a lot of potential, but the filmmakers took the easy way out."

The film, which is directed by the Wachowskis, is stunning to watch, the visuals definitely add to the dystopian tone of the film. Almost every shot has some kind of reflection, depth, or color contrast to make the science fiction even cooler. The film editing is also incredible and makes every action sequence amazing to watch. The visual effects are also amazing, especially for 1999. This is a must-see sci-fi film."

The fight scenes, with cool bullet dodging, guns , helicopters, all the martial arts, it was all so exciting, apart from two scenes that always freaked me out. Neo's mouth going missing and when Neo gets the bugs in and out of his stomach, plus I might add the baby scene too, when Neo is born again. But other than that it was just a cool movie with cool clothes.\n\nBut boy was it even better to watch it as an adult. The complexity and symbolism throughout every scene is so detailed. It's almost as if every line is deeply thought out and chosen. Concepts that were way too hard as a kid like the connection of the ship being called Nebuchadnezar, being connected with dreams and reality. Or the white rabbit and Alice in Wonderland references. Each of these tip offs were sp exciting, especially what occurs in Neos interactions with the people coming to his door. How did I miss the lines of them saying wake up. Neo spends the first half of the movie asking so many questions. It was also great to see how times have changed from 1999 technology and the phones used in the office scenes.\n\nThe acting and casting is superb in this movie. I love every character. Hugo Weaving, Keanu Reeves especially display one of the best faces off battles of good versus bad that I've scene. And that gun scene in the foyer has the be thee most insane shoot out fighting scene in movie history. The fighting is so impressive. All credit to the effort the movie makers and cast put into pulling this off with excellence!\n\nThe costumes and colour design is also well thought out with the green that matches the Matrix reality.\n\nThis .movie is so good. If you haven't watched it for a while or again as an adult, I'd highly recommend."

Probably that's why it didn't do as well as big, dumb, lumbering things like \"Independence Day\" and \"The Phantom Menace\", and a dozen or so films I didn't bother to watch.\n\nMuch of what you will have heard about this film is false. You will have heard that the premise is that we're all prisoners in a virtual reality world; but the premise is not that WE are prisoners in a virtual reality world - it's a good deal more interesting than that. You will have heard that it's hip and cynical; but thankfully, it's neither. You will have heard the word \"cyberpunk\" being used, with the odd allusion to films like \"The Ghost in the Shell\" and \"Blade Runner\"; but it's NOT pretentious, deep-breathing, tawdry angst of that kind at all. It's really quite charming once you get to know it. Beneath all the up-to-the-minute computer gimcracks lies a gentle and trusting heart.\n\nThe central character is played by Keanu Reeves, and I retract my claim that there's no use for the man. Indeed he acts rather well. Admittedly he plays a character who spends most of the film, and indeed most of his life, with the air of someone who (in the words of another character) isn't worried because he expects to wake up soon; but being able to do this well is being able to do something well. Besides, we spend the opening half being at least half as bewildered as he is - even if we've read the plot synopsis. When the set-up is revealed in all its glory I admit that one or two details are a bit far fetched. But I never felt that my intelligence was insulted in the way things had been revealed to me.\n\nSpecial effects are marvellous. I don't think I've ever seen computer-generated images look this convincing - usually they disfigure a movie - and there are several reasons why they work so well. A dark (but attractively dark) style of lighting shows them at their best. Psychological tricks - well-chosen camera angles, misdirection - are used to make us believe in what we see: no-one makes the assumption that George Lucas made in \"The Phantom Menace\", that software alone will do the trick. And more to the point, a story has been chosen where the kind of technology favoured by Hollywood these days is not out of place. The air of vague phoniness that computer effects impart, the sense that something is deeply wrong, is exactly what we want in a story where something really IS deeply wrong.\n\nOnly two things let the film down: the last couple of minutes (and after two fantastic hours I can forgive a little fumble at the end), and a HORRIBLY synthetic musical score, which seems to be there only to make us glad when it stops. Luckily it stops often enough and it only succeeds in ruining one or two scenes. I don't know - maybe this kind of musical pollution has been around for a while, and I only noticed it now because \"The Matrix\", unlike the brainless action movies surrounding us on all sides, deserves better."

How many of us today have not felt or wondered if this is all real? Does the Matrix have you? Classic lines from the movie which ask questions on several levels.\n\nCasting was excellent, direction was top notch, and the CGI was over the top. People will forget or have forgotten the new methods and techniques that the Matrix brought to us that we now see on TV and every other movie out on the screen today. A much better product then the next two Matrix movies. I would recommend both of those to hard-core fans of the The Matrix. So if you want a great action flick or a great action flick which will make you think the Matrix is the movie for you to watch. Now after the success or lack of success of Matrix I, II, and III will there be a Number 4? Will Neo return? In many ways I hope he does."

I'm dead sure they didn't understand the story behind the world & the principles of the Matrix. Go see this movie 5 times more, then watch the Animatrix & read the books, maybe you need a manual to make it to your minds who knows....\n\nI agree that a quite similar idea was used in Alex Proyas' Dark City. But what if I tell you both Dark City, & this so called Star Trek Episode is a complete copy of another concept?\n\nGo see for yourself. Google these keywords down :\n\n\"ALLEGORY OF THE CAVE by Plato\"\n\n\"Thinking so ruthless for the ones who create or derive ideas & improve them to a point where they can shape it into a movie, & not showing any respect for creative minds\"....\n\nit's a very easy thing to do. If I start to think so blame oriented, then I come to a conclusion which is \"from this time ,no one should make a movie. No horror movies! No vampires, no werewolves, no creatures. No thrillers with killers. Why? because these were all used 200 centuries ago in books & literature. Oh all movies are copycats right!?!? Then I think we should kill ourselves, drink cyanide or something. there is nothing else to do in this world."

        "review_detailed_main": "Finally a science fiction film that cannot be immediately dismissed as either unreal or impossible. How can anyone say that this isn't exactly the way that reality is? To try and disprove this view of reality would be like trying to disprove the existence of God. Maybe he's there, maybe he isn't, but no one can possibly prove it either way. It works the same way for The Matrix. It is possible that everything that we see is fed into our minds by machines and that we would never know it.\n\nProbably the only remotely convincing argument the other way would be that if that were true, why would the machines give us a movie like this to watch? It would expose them! But then again, maybe they just want to get us thinking, maybe to see how we'll react to the possibility of their existence. Maybe they are getting ready to present themselves to us. Robot rapture! Who can say that the Wachowski brothers are not messengers?\n\nThis is by far the best science fiction film that I have ever seen. Aside from the relatively plausible story, every other element of the film was spectacular! The special effects (which, in my opinion, usually take more away from a film than they add) were awesome, the fight scenes were incredibly intense, and the pace of the film itself was breathtaking. Every hole is covered up brilliantly, even down to a definition of deja-vu and a possible reason for why so many different foods taste like chicken. These little ties to reality are one of the best ways that this film was able to come off so realistically.\n\nThe Matrix is absolutely not to be missed. Even people who don't like science fiction or even action films will more than likely enjoy this film. It is well presented, it is not unnecessarily excessive, and it presents the most innovative camera work in years. It has something for everyone, and will become a science fiction classic without a doubt."

        "review_detailed_main": "i love this movie for the manny many themes that come up repeatedly. The story's arch is quite good in that it doesn't feel as though much of anything else could be added. The central philosophy is admirably brought to a movie that a mainstream audience can digest, along with metaphorical and allegorical strains of the bible, alice in wonderland, drug use, the life cycle, cartesian dualism, buddhist one consciousness, giger style enemies, artificial intelligence, newtonian physics, orwellian nightmares, and euclidean view of the world as a series of numbers and probabilities. Sci fi need not be the same old, evil monster chase humans without rhyme or reason. The movie dooes sidestep charecter development by making it's charecters not know who they are, and also by killing most of them off as soon as they are met. while this isn't the arty pretentious greatness of citizen kane or waking life, it is a movie that is likely to be long remembered and worshipped like Star Wars"

        "review_detailed_main": "Like \"Blade Runner\", the \"Matrix\" trilogy has at least two different levels of story. Both are evident, but we, at first, only see the first and less important, which is the Matrix itself and the man-against-machine war. The second level, which is the central plot of the whole thing, is so obvious that it becomes invisible.\n\nIf you liked this movie more than the sequel, \"Matrix: Reloaded\", then you, like almost everyone else, didn't understand it. If you are feeling bad about that, don't worry, it took me almost eight years to finally understand it, too! Many people liked this first part, the rest hated it, and both didn't understand it. Interestingly enough, the ones that hated it were closer to understanding it than those that liked it. People that didn't like the \"Matrix\" trilogy always talk about the \"shallow story\" and the \"cheap philosophy\". As much as they are right about the cheap philosophy, they are complete and absolutely wrong about the shallow story. The \"pseudo-philosophic junk\" is, actually, junk, but a very important part of the story, and that is so clear in this first part of the trilogy that no one actually realized it. It happens because, taken alone, \"The Matrix\" is just a fantasy movie, placed some time in the future.\n\nThe key to realize the greatness of the \"Matrix\" trilogy is accepting that it is a science fiction, not a fantasy movie. With that in mind, you can find the real villain of the trilogy, then everything will make sense, including the things that make no sense at all in a science fiction movie, like Neo's skills, both inside and outside the Matrix. The really interesting thing is that the villain openly shows its evilness in \"Reloaded\", it even explains its reason to do the things it does, but we promptly forgive or forget it! And pay a lot of attention to the dialogs at the very ending, in \"Matrix: Revolutions\", don't be deceived or misled by the background, because they present the final results of the main struggle of the trilogy and you will realize who is the winner.\n\nSo, follow the white rabbit and find out who is the real villain in the \"Matrix\" trilogy. After that, you will see that almost all speeches in it have two completely different meanings, one that supports a weak futuristic cloak-and-dagger flick, with lots of \"cool\", but unimportant Greek-and-whatever references, and another that leads to a much darker reality, which will make you love the whole trilogy, or more properly, the trilogy as a whole, not only this first installment."

What made this movie great was the same reason that made A Clorkwork Orange great, it was very original and entertaining. That scene where Neo does the crazy bend back to dodge the bullets thing was purely amazing. Very unique storyline what with turning humans to batteries. That was just brilliant. I dare to even say that I liked the acting. Keanu Reeves and Laurance Fishburne(not sure if that's spelled right) were what clearly made this movie what it is. I still can't tell if Morpheous is a homosexual."
