        "review_detailed_main": "Is The Avengers a good film? No. Is it the worst film ever made? No. I first saw the movie at the cinema upon its release and, at that time, I did think that it was one of the worst films I'd seen up to that point. I've watched it 2 or 3 times since then and my opinion of it has improved, well, very slightly at any rate. Apart from a pervading incoherence, I think the film's major problem is its slightness; it's only an hour and a half long and the plot is very simplistic to say the least. It's not hard to imagine audiences feeling a bit short-changed when it first came out, especially as the film was a big-budget, would-be summer blockbuster. Another big problem is the casting of Uma Thurman as Emma Peel. Thurman has shown herself to be a fine actress in movies such as Pulp Fiction but she just looks out of her depth here (I never believed in her as a top-level scientist for a second) and her English accent doesn't sound natural. Nicole Kidman, to whom the role was first offered, would surely have been better, in particular, she's displayed flawless English accents in films such as The Others and The Hours. An English actress I also think would have made a great Peel is Joely Richardson but the studio would probably have vetoed such a choice on the grounds of her not being a big enough name. Ralph Fiennes was a real enigma in this film - there was nothing wrong in principle in casting him as Steed but he looks ill at ease throughout the movie as if he'd rather be elsewhere. I can only assume he'd already twigged that the film was going to be a turkey. What's worse, Fiennes and Thurman have absolutely no chemistry between them, which wastes the snappy dialogue they have with each other throughout the film. The supporting cast fare a bit better with seasoned pros such as Sean Connery, Jim Broadbent and Fiona Shaw making the most of their underdeveloped parts. The retro-chic world of the original TV series is nicely recreated and there's no shortage of nice cars, costumes and locations but what's good about the film is easily drowned out by what's bad; The Avengers is ultimately a shallow, rushed and messy affair, severely hampered by the performances of its two leads. Handled properly, the film could have been a wonderful success for all concerned, the first chapter of an entertaining and lucrative franchise, stretching well beyond the 1990s; instead it's one of the most embarrassing flops of that decade. The original cut of the film was apparently two and a half hours long but, following negative reactions from audiences at test screenings, the studio hacked the film down to its present one and a half hour length. This doesn't actually come as much of a surprise as there is a lack of proper narrative flow to the film suggestive of chunks of explanatory scenes having been cut out. Just one example: towards the end of the film, just before they enter Sir August's underwater lair, Steed and Peel enter a phone box and Peel says \"how now brown cow?\" down the phone. The phrase seems to be a password to enter the premises but how does Peel know it? There's been talk here and there of the possibility of Warners releasing a director's cut or special edition DVD, restoring the original two and a half hour version. I think this would be a good idea and I'd definitely be interested in watching the full version of the film. It's highly unlikely to be any kind of masterpiece but it's difficult to imagine that it wouldn't improve upon the movie as it stands. At the very least you'd have to assume that it would be more coherent. Sadly I don't think the chances of Warners going down this line are high; I have the feeling that this is a movie the studio would rather forget about than draw attention to."

Today I have just seen it again on DVD and I found again a silly and boring movie that wastes cast and budget. It is hard to believe that Sean Connery accepted to work in this turkey.

        "review_detailed_main": "Warner Bros. fantasies have always had a certain memorable flare. Dating back to films like \"Superman\" and \"Blade Runner\", a viewer could always be guaranteed at least a ticket into another world. \"The Avengers\" would have been that next \"big\" thing for Warner Bros. had it not been so shoddily edited at the last minute. It should be duly noted, however, that this film had all the signs of a thanksgiving turkey: It's release date, which was moved from late June to the dog days of August. Then the fact that no press screenings have been allowed for critics. No good can come of these prophecies.\n\n\"The Avengers\", which, at best, is a second rate version of the original \"Batman\" has all the features of your top blockbuster: A Big name or two, a plethora of explosions, and enough special-effects to put \"Godzilla\" to shame. The Plot follows the exploits of the legendary secret agents John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman), as they do battle with a maniacal meteorologist (Sean Connery) who has intentions on controlling the world's weather. Simple enough. Or so one would have thought. It would appear that some 25 minutes (!) was excised from the film as a result of poor test screenings. As history has told, no good comes from test screenings. As a result, the film becomes so utterly confusing that the viewer would sooner give up, rather than be insulted by a film that insists on staying one step ahead of you at all times. Only potentially good films are butchered in an attempt to make the film more appealing to youngster's attention spans. But make no mistake about it, this film is certainly not for children. Perhaps the last half hour will provide enough enjoyable action (and it does, believe me!) to distract them, but up until then the film consists of awkward dialogue, inane action (Gigantic teddy bears, anyone?), and an uncomfortable overdose of strangeness.\n\nThe cast, at one time, might have been game, but only once in a while does Ralph Fiennes even crack a smile. Thurman has apparently got the English accent down perfectly, but the only problem lies in the fact that she forgets to give a performance worth remembering. And last, but certainly not least, Sean Connery. Sadly, he doesn't even look like he wants to take over the world. Only once, in a mumbled rant, does he evoke some feelings of evil. That being said, \"The Avengers\" is a technical masterpiece. Providing the viewer with a universe of dazzling sets (that should at least be nominated for an oscar), imaginative visual effects, and beautiful costumes, one almost forgets that England doesn't look like this anymore. Unless of course, you live there. The score, composed by Joel McNeely proves to be one of the coolest scores ever produced. Inducing excitement, tension, and a little smoothness, provided by some nifty jazz notes. All of which the film is unable to do itself. For those who won't enjoy this film, it is mercifully brief. So brief to the point that it's strange. It jumps from a one hour section of the beginning to a half hour of climactic action that the viewer blinks and the movie might just be rolling into the credits. One can only hope for an improvement with a director's cut. Until then, this film should gain cult status before it makes it's way to video. Which I'm sure will be soon.\n\nOut Of Four - **"

I was ridiculously excited for the arrival of this film and had nauseated all my friends when the project was first announced about who was to be our two spies. I was thrilled with the selection of Fiennes -- but Thurman? I was hesitant. Then Diana Rigg passed on being in the film. Another bad sign. Then, the television trailers, yet a third omen but I told myself the movie could not possibly be that bad. IT was worse than my wildest nightmares -- and I have an excellent imagination. Thurman was as bad as I thought, Fiennes had nothing to play to. Macnee, oh, how it could have improved if we'd seen him. I think this movie is terrible because they didn't get the joke. The Avengers is cheeky, campy, fun, and never without some form of the double entendre somewhere. Apparently, the script writes never actually saw the series and didn't get the joke. I beg, some British filmmaker somewhere give it a chance. Make your own version. Give some dignity back."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie based on the popular British TV series is such a flop it doesn't really deserve comment, but here are a few nonetheless.\n\nThis is the kind of movie making that really has you wonder if you should ever visit a theater again, when you consider the waste of millions of dollars on sets, special effects and high-powered actors that could have been used for such better causes (such as, oh, say a big-screen version of \"My Mother the Car\").\n\nAt any rate, the film got what it deserved by being universally panned by critics and bombing at the box office. It was then rushed out of theaters with the bad-film strategy that relative obscurity would result in more bread at the video stores.\n\nConsidering that Ralph Fiennes (Schindler's List, Englsh Patient) and Uma Thurman (Pulp Fiction, etc.) were at the top of their box-office draw potential, and with the addition of the always popular Sean Connery in a unique role as a villain, one would think that this movie would have been a sure hit. However, the potential went lightning fast down the tubes, greased by a stinky script, second-guessed editing and incompetent direction.\n\nThe best elements of the original series, namely, its charm and style, are absent. A lot of the charm came from the relationship between Steed and Peel. But Fiennes' Steed is aloof and Thurman's Mrs. Peel is cold as ice. The two appear to be sleepwalking through their respective roles, with visions of fat paychecks dancing in their heads.\n\nIronically, an imprudent element of the TV series that was indicative of its downhill slide after the departure of Diana Rigg (the original Mrs. Peel), namely, the introduction of the silly character of \"Mother,\" IS included in the film. Go figure.\n\nConnery 's performance as a mastermind who can manipulate the world's weather falls flat. Like Fiennes and Thurman, he appears to be going through the motions of a script he has no faith in.\n\nQuirky aspects of the original series that were cute and amusing have been replaced with gimmicks that are just unfunny strange and head-scratchingly bizarre. For example: the requisite cameo of an actor from the original series features only the voice of Patrick Macnee in the role of an invisible man behind a desk. What this character has to do with anything, other than adding to an already disjointed script, is anybody's guess.\n\nOn a website competently dedicated to the series it has been speculated that the director never saw a single episode of the TV Avengers. If you were any kind of fan, you will immediately observe that there is a good reason to believe this. Jeremiah Chechik's direction seems to lack any instinct for the flavor of the original series.\n\nAt any rate, with this brand of TV series-inspired movie making, you may find yourself yearning for \"Return to Gilligan's Island.\" Originally hyped as a summer blockbuster, the cinematic version of \"The Avengers\" is only spectacular in its capacity to disappoint."

I would NEVER put it in the Bottom 100 as I can name many other movies that are much worse than this one (FREDDY GOT FINGERED, THE CAT IN THE HAT and DISASTER MOVIE for example).\n\nIn this full length version of the 1960s TV show John Steele and Emma Peel battle with a duplicate Emma Peel and Sir August de Wynter (played by Sean Connery), a mastermind that wants to rule the world with his weather-controlling machine. And while this plot could look stupid to some, it certainly is! But you can't do anything but admire the extraordinary special effects as well the sets. In particular I loved the special effects (the CGI insects were cool to look at). I personally can't give a 1 to a movie with great special effects and sets, it deserves at least other 4 points for the effects.\n\nAs for the acting, even though the movie it's bland Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman are good in their roles. And it was a surprise for me seeing Sean Connery in such a nasty role and Patrick Mcnee as the Invisible Jones (a small role).\n\nHowever, while the movie is a bit bad, it's watchable and far from a huge disappointment.

I am pretty sure that THE AVENGERS is the worst movie of the decade and one of my least favorite movies of all time.\n\nJohn Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman) team up to stop Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery) from destroying the planet with a weather-changing machine. I won't go into the plot too deeply, because it's just plain stupid.\n\nThe acting in this movie was not very good. Ralph Fiennes and Fiona Shaw (Father) play two of the most annoying characters in any movies that I have ever seen. The constant unwitty one-liners between Fiennes and Thurman is very annoying. Sean Connery is at his worst here. I was disappointed in him, because he is a great actor who doesn't belong in this movie. Sir August de Wynter? Just the name of the character alone should tell you much.\n\nThere was, however, one thing that was good about this movie. That would be Uma Thurman in her tight leather. I am absolutely in love with Uma Thurman, and I don't think she belonged in this film, but I am pretty sure seeing her wearing those catsuits were the only thing that kept me from having to eat my own legs and drink my own urine to survive this movie.\n\nMaybe you'll think I'm exaggerating a bit, but I found this movie to be boring and annoying. I recommend that it be avoided at all costs."

Sean Connery's eccentric megalomaniac (so much more interesting than a serious, conservative megalomaniac) fit right in with the The Avenger's roster of enemies.\n\nWhatever sense of fun the movie had (and The Avengers tv series never seemed to take itself too seriously; does anyone remember Steed being shrunk to the size of a mouse and jabbing a villain in the ankle with a fountain pen?) was destroyed when the nut jobs at the studio fell for the old \"edit out what the test audience didn't like\" trick, and put a botched film on the screen.

Uma Thurman fares slightly better, but there's never any real chemistry between them, and it just makes you long to see the original instead.\n\nWhy do they drink tea all the time? I don't remember that happening in the real Avengers! Predictable views of tourist London only serve to add to the feeling that someone thinks this will all make it more 'English' & please a section of the American audience who think England is still like how it was 50 years ago.\n\nSean Connery does a good job as the villain bent on controlling the weather with his elaborate machine (nods to the episode 'A Surfeit of H2O' here), but the whole Bond-like epic climax falls flat, & goes down the drain faster than rain in a rainstorm.\n\nThis whole ludicrous film feels contrived, unreal, charmless and cartoonish.

Although its about as far away from the original television series as you can get, there's this retro '60s thing going on with the film which makes it pretty amusing to watch. Although the fact that the cast members are obviously taking everything as a joke does get on your nerves after a while, I consider this to be an enjoyable failure and I must admit that I pretty much enjoyed some of the individual scenes.\n\nYou know you're in for a crazy time with the film's opening, which sees Steed walking down an apparently normal English street only to be attacked by a number of surprise assailants. For example, at one moment a whistling milkman smashes two empty bottles together to use them as weapons as he lunges as Steed. This exceptionally odd beginning sets the campy tone for the rest of the film, which is not for all tastes it has to be said.\n\nPacked with cheesily overemphasised dialogue, lots of one-liners and innuendos worthy of a Bond movie, THE AVENGERS has the benefit of a huge budget to include lots of nifty (but hardly convincing) computer effects. These include an attack by a swarm of mechanical bees, characters walking in see-through bubbles and the climatic \"storm within a building\" scene which is sufficiently loud and over-the-top enough to be a crowd-pleasing event. Elsewhere, we have the ever-odd Eddie Izzard as a mute henchman, one of the least threatening ever to grace a cinema (or television) screen, and bad guys dressed up as giant multicoloured teddy bears in order to disguise their identities.\n\nRalph Fiennes (looking a lot like a young version of Peter Cushing) essays the role of the straight-faced John Steed, and is pretty good; Uma Thurman plays the leather-suited Emma Peel: one wonders why she agreed to be in such a fantastic movie again after the failure of BATMAN & ROBIN but I guess she's a glutton for punishment. Sean Connery is the non-threatening chief villain, and has had enough experience with Bond villains in order to know how to play it, but his performance is somewhat weak. Elsewhere, we have Jim Broadbent as the wheelchair-bound Mother, leader of the agents, and a funny turn from Patrick Macnee as an invisible agent (!).\n\nThe major problem is the obvious cutting that went on with the film after initial test screenings, which undoubtedly make events confusing at times. In my mind this just adds to the weirdness. See it for yourself to find out how."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Avengers\" is one of the biggest money-losers of the decade. I've read estimates that it lost $40,000,000...and with a film this clumsily and expensively made, I can certainly understand it. Initial previews went disastrously for the studio and they had the brilliant idea of trimming 26 minutes from the movie. Unfortunately, this made the film choppy and incomprehensible...and audience members stayed away in droves. So why did I decide to watch it? It was simply too infamously bad for me to resist it!\n\nThe plot is a confusing mess involving a duplicate Emma Peel (Uma Thurman) and a guy who can apparently control the weather (Sean Connery). But the characterization of these and all the people seemed unimportant and everyone in the film lacks depth...and you have no idea WHY they do what they do. Instead the film focuses heavily on overly mannered dialog (to the point of being incredibly annoying), lots of expensive stunts (something never seen in the original TV show) and gadgets (such as giant robotic wasps, an invisible agent as well as a board meeting where EVERYONE is inexplicably dressed like the Grateful Dead bears...also the sorts of thing not seen in the TV show, thank God). Clearly, the folks who made the film had a severe lack of reverence for the source material...which would irritate the die-hard fans. And, the incomprehensibility and constant style over substance would certainly irritate all the rest of us! This is an expensive looking film which just doesn't make much sense, isn't entertaining and substitutes stunts and gadgets for plot.\n\nSo, is it as bad as its reputation? Perhaps not...but dollar for dollar, you'd be very hard-pressed to find a film that delivers this little for the dollar! It's wastefully bad...and about as much fun as a case of the Shingles."

The problems lie in the stodgy pace and direction, the inane and really quite terrible script and the uninteresting story. In regards to the cast, Fiennes is the only one who is decent enough, Uma Thurman is miscast, Sean Connery phones it in and the supporting cast are unforgivably wasted with so little to do.

But........it's great! Incredibly stylish, amazing sets, great acting and as light-hearted and witty as the original TV series.\n\nThe two leads are excellent, and contrary to what has been claimed, do indeed have a wonderful chemistry between them. I would argue that Ralph Fiennes is incapable of giving a bad performance, and Uma Thurman is rather wonderful too. Their dialogue is very well written with quips a-plenty. Sean Connery is hilarious, and obviously relished his role as the baddie, and Jim Broadbent is equally amusing. The plot is wafer thin and zips along splendidly. I wasn't aware until I read other comments here that the film was butchered by studio executives. If that is indeed the case, I add my vote for a Director's Cut. 90 minutes was definitely too short.\n\nThe initial failure of this film at the box office was undoubtedly due to its subtlety. Understatement and tongue-in-cheek humour have never been a premium on the other side of the pond, and I imagine that in Blighty the TV series is seen through such thick lensed rose-coloured spectacles that any movie version was bound to be heretical.\n\nWhich is funny - granted that Diana Rigg played the sexiest TV character in history and that Patrick McNee was perfect as John Steed, but anyone who actually watches these old episodes will be aware of their surrealness and complete inability to take themselves seriously (hats off to the writers). These are exactly the elements that the movie version captures so well. Hats off to Mr Chechik, the director (and Canadian - significant?) After so many turgid and gloomy blockbusters (Bourne trilogy, new Bond - entertaining but not exactly a barrel of laughs) it was fantastic to discover this lost classic. Watch it!"

The reason it failed was not IMO the surreal wackiness, it was that Warners panicked and cut huge chunks out of the film rendering it not only surreal and weird, but missing links in the story that would have tied all the bizarre stuff together better.\n\nIf you look on Wikipaedia it details what was in the original script, such as the attack on the secret base by the evil Emma Peel that was seen in trailers. I also recommend reading the novelisation, which you can pick up for a couple of quid. It really is absurdly stupid how Warners had, judging by the book and screenplay, a great film and then they decided 'instead of a long movie people might like, we'll cut it down to a short movie that people will hate for sure'. They should have had the courage of their convictions, and if they had The Avengers might have been a huge success. One can only hope they pull their fingers out and release the director's cut.\n\nOn reflection there's a lot to like in The Avengers: Uma Thurman in leather: always a plus, Sean Connery hamming it up more than Porky Pig at a bacon factory, and henchmen dressed as multi-coloured teddy bears. Bonkers. Utter bonkers. I like it."

There's a preview on many home videos these days that features clips from classic old films, designed to inspire the viewer to go out and buy or rent movie classics - you know, Gone With the Wind and the like. I had the same impression, watching The Avengers. Mr. Freeze and his plan to chill the world, from Batman. The cat woman's costume and persona, draped on Uma Thurman. The catwalk fight scene from Moonraker. Search parties dispatched to locate James Bond, who turns up in a life raft with his romantic interest. A sprinkling of the hurricane special effects from Twister. There's even computer generated special effect attack bugs from an episode of TV's Gene Roddenberry's Earth: Final Conflict. To name but a few.\n\nDoes this producer have a single original thought in his head? You know, there are places in the world where people get fired for reproducing someone else's work without citing the source [like Boston!].\n\nRalph Fiennes, in The English Patient, made me feel his intense love and desire, and his subsequent anguish. The only anguish I felt watching the Avengers was over the total lack of character development. Both Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes were trapped into reciting lines that left them no opportunity to flesh out actual characters. That is not to say that a movie has to be serious for the audience to believe in the \"hero,\" James Bond films being a perfect example. The Avengers fell terribly short.\n\nPerhaps Sean Connery got involved in this project, wanting to play the diabolical genius madman, bent on conquering the earth. What great fun that could be for an actor of his caliber. The same can be said for the motivations behind Thurman and Fiennes' roles as well-known heroes. Too bad the script was written so badly, the story so disjointed, to derail even the most devoted fans. The musical score was just as uninspiring.\n\nAnd tell me, please, what's going on with the greasy guy in the wheelchair sucking down cigarettes? And the blind chick that is just too weird? What's the motto here? The bad guys are ugly, handicapped, and bizarre? I don't get it.\n\nWhat was good about this movie? If you're into fashion, Thurman's wardrobe was stunning from start to finish. And sure, for the ladies, seeing Ralph Fiennes in the buff - okay, that was fun (though you didn't really need to do that, Ralph.)\n\nThis movie will definitely appeal to the average 15 year old, preoccupied with role models who have something \"cool\" to say, in any situation. If you're past the pimple stage in your life, however, these characters are as flat as the screen on which they're projected.\n\nOverall, leave this film to rent when it comes out on video (maybe, next week) when you are looking for something mindless to do for 90 minutes."

This is one of the worst directing jobs I've ever seen.

Fiennes and Thurman do the best they can, but, given that they both have exactly the same failings, I'm left to believe that they were actually directed to depict it that way.\n\nThe dialog is extremely fast and precise, as if they were directed to ennunciate every word crisply, but as quickly as they possibly could. It comes acrossed as being as natural as polyester. The effects and props are extremely contrived in their delivery (who came up with the bear suit idea??? - and I don't get the invisible man thing either).\n\nI gave this a two just because I actually have seen worse.

        "review_detailed_main": "I guess there are two ways of looking at 1998's 'The Avengers' film (and, yes, it has NOTHING to do with the Marval brand that would dominate the Box Office a decade later). You can either believe everything you've heard about it, or just keep an open mind and go with the flow.\n\nIt's a remake of a British 1960s spy show about a male and female secret agent, generally saving the world with gadgets and an assortment of witty quips. The studio had high hopes for the big budget adaptation and cast two major stars (Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman) in the lead. However, close to release it became clear (from 'critics,' anyway) that the movie wasn't that good and its release date got put forward while they did reshoots, or re-edits etc, trimming the run-time dramatically. When it did hit theatres, basically everyone hated it, claiming it was a 'mess' and it now lives on only in top ten lists of movies that bombed hard.\n\nYet, saying all that, I quite enjoyed it. I enjoyed it then and I enjoy watching it on DVD every so often. No, I'm not saying it's perfect (or even that good!), but I'm saying there's enough there to keep me entertained for an hour and a half.\n\nFor a start there's Sean Connery as the bad guy, who's threatening to control the world's weather and force countries to 'purchase' their weather directly from him. Therefore, Fiennes and Thurman must stop him. Yes, it's kind of like a Bond film plot and you can expect the regular punch-ups and car chases that come with the genre.\n\nWhat you also get are some truly surreal scenes which don't make a lot of sense. Now, these could be written just to add to the film's 'kooky' feel, or it could be because the other scenes that explain them were left on the cutting room floor, therefore leaving these scenes' meaning up to our imagination.\n\nPeople also remarked on 'how little chemistry' there was between Fiennes and Thurman. I can see their point. However, it's worth noting that they were supposed to be playing cold and unflappable characters lifted from yesteryear when this kind of acting/social interaction was more common. It's a case where the film tried to copy the source material and succeeded - only a little too well for its own good.\n\nLike I say, 'The Avengers' is just about as far from perfect as you'll ever get, but it's not the car crash you've probably heard it is. And, if you're in the mood for a spy movie that's a little bit different and has a mute Eddie Izzard, a gun-totting Granny and a swarm of robot bees, then give this one a go. And I didn't even mentioned the giant teddy bear costumes."

This is mainly because she has long legs, and is frequently naked in her various films. Her most famous parts have been short, and very uncomplicated. As Emma Peel she is brutal. The original Mrs. Peel, played then by Diana Rigg , possessed a kittenish, yet lethal sexuality,all the while exuding intelligence and mystery as she spoke. Rigg's Peel was art, in vaguely arty times.\n\nThurman's Peel suffers from an uncomfortably affected British accent. Frankly, even without this impediment, Uma is just not up to the task.\n\nHollywood often tries to bolster bad scripts and bad ideas with what is often referred to as, T&A.\n\nThe Avengers is unique in that you can find bad writing, bad acting, and bad production, all in one expensive package. Unfortunately it is not bad enough to be camp."

        "review_detailed_main": "Disclaimer: I'm a HUGE fan of the original The Avengers television series (well, at least the Emma Peel era). It's brilliant. With great anticipation, I went to see this film in the theater back in 1998. It had a lot to live up to, but I tried to be fair with my assessment. Unfortunately, the movie failed on almost every level. I rewatched The Avengers last night for the first time in 20 years. I wondered if time had been any kinder to the film.\n\nThe short answer is no - The Avengers is still (and will always be) a steaming pile of dung. The movie is a bloated, boring, and often confusing mess. There are so many problems I have with this one that I could quite literally write pages. However, for brevity's sake, I'll limit my discussion to two of the most obvious issues:\n\n1. The relationship between Steel and Mrs Peel was one of the main things that always made The Avengers special. It was the soul of the entire series. In the movie, it never works. To begin with, Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman have nothing that resembles real chemistry. They never click and it all feels forced. The relationship in the original was always flirtatious, but never went much further than a knowing look. Having Steed and Mrs Peel engage in a real relationship as pictured here destroys all the mystery.\n\n2. The plot is a complete disaster. You can read about how the movie originally ran much longer but was gutted after comments form test audiences. The resulting mess is full of plot holes, events with no explanation, and an apparent lack of logic. Not that I think these missing minutes would have helped that much, however. If you put the cut footage back in, you'd probably only add to the films utter dullness. I was bored to tears.\n\nI could go on about the acting, the ridiculous special effects, the poor editing, the invisible Patrick Macnee, or the fact that so much of the movie feels random simply for the sake of being random. But really, why bother? With a movie this bad, the time I've already spent on The Avengers is more than it deserves. While I rate the original series a 9/10, I'm being generous with the 2/10 I'm giving the movie."

I preemptively avoid things I'm not going to like, but this one slipped through as I watched it with friends in the theater when it came out 20 years ago.\n\nThe interesting question to me 20 years later is not how bad it was, but why it was so bad.\n\nIt's not the fault of the people in front of the camera, all more than talented enough to pull this off. I'm not inclined to blame the people behind the cameras either. The movie is competent enough at a technical level. Though the script, direction, and camerawork were all lackluster, that just makes a film dull, not terrible. No, I think the responsibility for this one is ultimately the Hollywood system as it existed in the 1990s. Studios imposed a lot of requirements on any film which was going to be marketed as an action blockbuster. Chase scenes, big special effects set-pieces, explosions, Sean Connery's name on the marquee, more chase scenes.\n\nThe Avengers (TV series) is not action, the draw is the amiable, flirting but non-romantic interaction between the lead couple, the sixties glamour and charm, and lightheartedness mixed in with campy international intrigue.\n\nI'd say that The Avengers (movie) got Micheal Bay-ized except that's being unfair to Bay. He made Pain and Gain after all so we know even he can manage stylish humor, at least of the sardonic variety.\n\nNope ... this movie is just dead. An assembly-line commercial product with no redeeming qualities. All the interesting and fun things cut out, nothing of value added in."

There is dialogue aplenty here, but it's never bright. There is wordplay in spades with a screenplay that is overwritten by half -- wait for the novelization. When delivered under the sluggish direction of Jeremiah Chechik, the banter is lifeless, as dead as a mechanical wasp from the film's most throwaway special effects sequence. Patrick MacNee provides a guest voice, and Ralph Fiennes does admirably well in MacNee's old role of Steed. The glamorous Dame Diana Rigg played Mrs. Peel the first time around. Here we have Uma Thurman. She has rarely been sexy or provocative in the past. She can't seem to find it here in her bone-dry, too clever repartee with Steed. Sean Connery chews the scenery -- there's a lot of it on the film's fabulous country estates. At least he looks natural in a kilt. The film revolves around natural disasters, but it managed to become one in the process."

When I heard about an Avengers movie I assumed we'd be getting a bastardised Hollywood formula movie, and it would resemble some of the recent Bond films more than the original series. But I was thrilled to find the film had the same wonderful sense of absurdity as the show. :)\n\nI think a lot of people are unaware this is a complete comedy. This being the case it's not surprising people think it's bad, but that's their problem. The comedy style is not a popular one, it's a particular style of generally British humour, best described as complete and utter nonsense. If you have no appreciation for absurdity, then you will NOT like this film.\n\nNothing in The Avengers should be taken at face value, it's all a load of s***. Steed and Peel are full of s***, that's the point. No one acts the way they do, they are both constantly trying to out cocky each other. The world of The Avengers is a place where \"small things are taken with the utmost seriousness and important things are not taken seriously at all\".\n\nThe Avengers purposely doesn't explain things, it's not supposed to make sense, that would ruin it. It's the little things in The Avengers that make it shine. Small asides from left-field that seem to go over most peoples heads.\n\nFiennes and Thurman are different than Macnee and Rigg, but I'm not sure they're much worse. Fiennes could perhaps have been a bit more cheerful. Thurmans whole screen presence is so vastly different from Riggs that it's impossible to compare, but I did enjoy Thurmans version of the infalable Peel. Connery going nuts was fun to see too. BTW Eddie Izzard not talking was the point of him being there, get it. Having Eddie Izzard in your movie and not having him say anything is to my mind very funny.\n\nIt's very hard to explain to people who flock to films like The Waterboy, why a film like The Avengers is so funny. Most people I guess will just never get it. I got it, and I'm glad that there ARE plenty of other people who did too. Congrats to the makers for daring to be different and convincing the studio into letting you spend $70 million.\n\n8/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I can see why this may not be some people's very particular cup of tea, but to call it one of the worst movies ever made is - quite frankly - preposterous! Ralph Fiennes DOES look uncomfortable, but Thurman is perfect as Mrs Peel; and if only the stars hadn't got cold feet in the same way the studio did, this could have been one of the most triumphant casting successes ever!\n\nThe production design is cool, harking back to a 60's era of far-out psychedelia, and some of the set-pieces are inspired and downright hilarious. The film's many flaws (make no mistake - they are here in droves) actually made the film a much more enjoyable experience for me, because unbelievably, they meshed with the 'trippy' feeling the film wallows in. No chemistry between the two stars? True enough, but the characters are so weird anyway that's it's almost like they're designed to have their own orbit. Although there are cavernous chunks missing from the plot, it DOES mean that you can never be totally sure what will happen next. As this should never be misconstrued as a drama, that's no bad thing.\n\nAs escapism it's thoroughly enjoyable and none too taxing on the patience, looking positively trim these days at just under an hour and a half. I'm one of its lone defenders, so its obvious that the film is not for all tastes; but for those with an appetite for the kooky, kitsch and often BAD, it's fun. Far more enjoyable than watching countless other far worse films trying to make a sober point.\n\nI'm even so kindly disposed to this film that if I saw it for about \u00a34, I'd buy it! I'd be wary of paying more than a fiver, though. There is a retail line for each product that an individual should not cross. For \"The Avengers\", I'd say that's probably mine... !"

I knew that they had avoided reviewer screenings, and understood the implications of that studio decision. I had seen the original series and while I liked it, I did not consider myself a huge fan. Unlike some I know, I had no problems seeing Uma Thurman as Emma Peel.\n\nHowever, nobody I know who saw The Avengers was prepared for how BAD it was. Despite what looks on paper like an excellent cast of quality actors, they lacked almost any on screen chemistry and not even their combined talents could rescue this dismal film.\n\nInstead of the witty banter the director strived for, what we end up with is endless prattle. Both Thurman and Fiennes appear to be just going through the motions. In fact, Fiennes' (who I consider an excellent actor) John Steed is so understated and stiff that he might as well have been replaced with a cardboard cut-out with a pair of moving lips. Sean Connery can't even save this turkey, seeming confused and bored on screen.\n\nThe only thing that might have saved the film was the cinematography. The Avengers is filled with eye candy and stirring images, but not even the camera work and set decoration in the film can save it. The opening theme was well done, but then disappears, leaving us with the rest of the score, which was simply disappointing.\n\nDebates have raged between those of us who weren't lucky enough to avoid this film over what the worst aspect of it was. Some say script, some say direction. Yet others insist it was the actors. For myself, I can sum the film up with a quote from my wife:\n\n\"It was a movie I was sorry I didn't wait to see on cable - someone else's cable.\""

The special effects were ok, but it doesn't take Fellini to figure why this tanked at the box office.\n\nSean Connery portrays the atypical mad genius character, which has been around since the dawn of movies, itself. Sean takes the ball and runs with it, churning out one of the hammiest performances I've witnessed in quite some time. Absolutely merciless. Patrick Macnee has a rather lengthy cameo, as well.\n\nWhen one takes into account the talent involved, THE AVENGERS should have captured at least a little bit of the magic that graced the 1960's series. Alas, it proved the old adage correct: \"You can't turn back the clock.\""

I heard rumors that Connery was offered the part of Morphius in \"The Matrix\", but turned it down because he felt it would be another \"Avengers\". Just as well, but Connery here is cringe-worthy. The plot itself is okay for an action adventure spy fantasy, but merely serves as a background for 90 minutes of cheeky British double-entendres (Or what an American thinks British double-entendres are) between the main players. A waste of time."

That drove me to only focus on the actors and how they played their roles. That's the 3 stars. I liked the acting and not much else. The feel of the original series comes through with Fiennes and Thurman's performances. The movie doesn't suffer from the acting and of course Connery playing a kind of Bond villain is fun.\n\nThe story has a good premise that fits in well with the type of stories you'd see during the Diana Rigg era of the TV show. There was even a story relating to weather \"A Surfeit of H2O\", but here it jumps from plot point to plot point with no link. You will ask yourself more than once, \"How did they get there?\" or \"How did they know to do that?\" Things just happen in between cartoonish CGI and action sequences. A better visual approach would be using the English locations like the show did and incorporate the strange visuals only lightly to really hammer home the idea of surrealism. This was the 90s though and CGI wasn't very old then. Maybe 15 years old.\n\nThe one really good lasting result of this movie and I do credit the buzz surrounding it when it was initially announced is The Avengers tv shows getting released remastered and unedited on home video by A&E. They started with the Rigg episodes in color then the black and white episodes, then most of the Honor Blackman episodes, then the Linda Thorson episodes and ending with whatever early episodes from 1961 and 1962 they could find. I am not sure any of them would be released had this movie never beem produced no matter how poorly it turned out. In that sense I am grateful to it because I never would've seen any of those old shows without those sets."

Uma Thurman delivers a worthy Emma Peel with more than enough man appeal to keep me starry-eyed to the screen for 90 minutes. Mr. Fiennes combines distinction, humour and resolution in a way that is worthy of Mr. John Steed. The plot is original, yet partly predictable - but aren't all of the original 'Avengers' episodes predictable by modern audiences? Isn't a Mozart symphony predictable? Add to this the cinematography that is just delicious, and you have a real audience treat, even for those who consider themselves long-time Avengers fans like me."

That the two of these films star Uma Thurman is unfortunate. However, I would argue that The Avengers isn't all that bad. Having recently viewed some of the original television series I have come to appreciate what was attempted with the movie.\n\nThis movie's tag-line is 'Saving the world in style' and that's precisely what it does. The Avengers is not a rough-and-tumble James Bond or Mission Impossible type action-adventure but a retro-stylish tongue-in-cheek jaunt through the marvelously preposterous diabolical schemes of an over-the-top madman. The tongue-in-cheek humour grates on most viewers but it is essential to this particular film in that it honours the source material wonderfully.\n\nThe casting of Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman is spot on, the overt double entendres between them is light and playful and they handle it with aplomb. The supporting cast is filled with wonderful character actors from Britan and Ireland including the likable Jim Broadbent and the delicious Fiona Shaw. Original TV series star Patrick Macnee makes an inventive cameo appearance.\n\nIf the film falls short in any way it is with Sean Connery. He is never presented with enough material to chew upon, and my only guess is that (seeing as it is a relatively short film) some of his scenes ended up on the cutting room floor.\n\nThat said, I think the film delivers precisely what it set out to do. That audiences stayed away and fans balked is a shame as it is a gloriously retro, stylish yet restrained romp. The opening title sequence is superb, the music fits perfectly and scenes such as the climactic inflatable ball river-walkers could have been iconic.\n\nWorth a look, in the right mood. I suggest watching some of the original episodes first. This is no action movie clone... Makes you wish it had been a success to see where they would have gone with a sequel."

The whole heart of the TV show was the tension between the agents. Thurman and Fiennes look like they filmed their lines on separate days and then dialogue scenes were pasted together later by a hermit who hadn't heard a human conversation in years. The dialogue was either so badly written or poorly spliced together that frequently it seemed they were talking right past each other, tossing out non sequiturs at each other like popcorn.\n\nThe plot and action of the film were obviously butchered beyond repair. Unless one has the attention span of someone on a very good marijuana high, the vast gaps in the narrative and even the action sequences will become very irritating. I would like to imagine that this was a good movie pruned into a mediocre movie by studio trolls, but this strikes me as wishful thinking. My guess is that the bare 90 minutes (boy does it feel longer than that) was the least crappy stuff they had to work with. The rest of it was probably just more unexciting chase scenes, unconvincing umbrella tricks, wooden Fiennes, Sean Connery yelling with a big stupid grin on his face, flat jokes, and so on.\n\nI can't believe they cast Eddie Izzard and gave him almost nothing to say.

It feels like there are action sequences missing from the film at the beginning. Particularly ridiculous is the disguise of the conspirators in multi -colored teddy bear outfits and the introduction of an invisible man who does nothing to help drive the story.\n\nFiennes does make a good Steed and Connery tries to give the film some energy, but altogether things just seem too disjointed. Definitely not worth full price admission and questionable for even discount prices."

It was good to hear Patrick MacNee again, and Ralph Fiennes made an acceptable Steed. Sean Connery made a good villain, although he overacted a bit. Overall, though, this is not a film I would recommend. My husband went so far as to compare it to Howard the Duck in its badness. He wanted to stand outside the theater and warn others, thus saving them from making his horrible mistake (cooler heads prevailed, however). We will settle with using this forum to warn you. Unless you need the sleep, do not go to see this film. If you must see Uma Thurman parade around in a variety of 1960's cat suits, wait for cable. Or video. Better just to skip it."

I really felt sorry for them. Patrick Macnee also made a cameo, but only a small one.\n\nThe main fault of the film is that there's not really much good about it, even the best scenes are still mediocre and with the budget, cast and screenwriters at their disposal this should have been miles better.\n\n2/10: Just watch the series"

At first, I was excited when they were shown on TV recently. But I soon stopped watching them. They didn't age well.\n\nWhen the movie came out, it didn't work on any level. It wasn't like the original series, so it didn't please those who expected it to be. It didn't have a good enough plot, and the actors seemed to have no idea who they were supposed to be playing.\n\nRalph Fiennes' performance was flat. Uma Thurman as Mrs Peel was the most spectacular piece of miscasting since Nastassja Kinski as Tess (of the D'Urbervilles)! Why not use British actresses for British roles?\n\nOne change I really didn't like. In the original series, there is no sexual relationship between Steed and Mrs Peel. Steed is a partner, a mentor, not a lover. In one of the final episodes, we even see Mr Peel, Emma's husband (he looks suspiciously like Patrick Macnee, of course). Steed is a gentleman, he would never presume on a married woman.\n\nThe relationship was very interesting, nonetheless. Making them lovers in the movie was a loss rather than a gain. All in all, a poor movie with few redeeming features."

But the stars put forth effort and give truly noteworthy attempts with a flagging script. The plot may be wretched, but the dialogue is clever and engaging. If nothing else, perhaps this is what makes watching The Avengers a lot like getting a visit from an witty-if-awkward friend.\n\nIf you're into the series, don't expect the polish given to that British classic, but don't be too afraid, either.

They rather spend the whole film throwing mindless banter at each other in order to see whom is the colder of the two.\n\nSean Connery could do no right in this film. I wish he had been smarter and stayed away from this project the moment he read the script. The scene with the teddy bears will forever register in my mind right up there with the fight with Robert Shaw in \"From Russia With Love\" or the laser scene with Gert Frobe in \"Goldfinger.\" Why Mr. Connery? Why?\n\nOne can fully understand why Warner Bros. went through such length to keep this film from being seen by critics before it was fully released. The script is awful, the characters uninteresting and the finale laughable. After all, no one in their right mind gave a damn as to whether Sir de Winter actually did control the world's weather. I'm sure all the armies in world wouldn't stand a chance against a very sensitive machine. Yeah, right.\n\nThis movie stands no chance of getting any kind of recommendation.\n\n3/10 stars."

Fiennes was hopelessly miscast; fine actor though he is, the character of John Steed needed someone with a bit of sleazy sparkle, a bit of a barfly, maybe. Except for one notable scene involving Miss Thurman and a pair of long leather boots, Fiennes' own powerful brand of steely sexuality remained firmly under wraps. It simply wasn't relevant to the character. Uma Thurman was trying so hard to hold onto her British accent that she forgot to act; Diana Rigg she ain't, after all. Connery hammed it up with a vengeance but couldn't save the day. Mysteriously, everyone's timing seemed to be off. Jokes fell flat. Sexy moments went limp. Fight scenes were risible.

Critics tend to jump on the (negative) bandwagon, the public gets an image stamped on its consciousness and the \"bomb\" label is like a self-fulfilling prophecy. This happened with the movie version of 'The Avengers.' It turns out the label is deserved, but maybe for different reasons than one might think.\n\n'The Avengers' doesn't suffer from a stupid script or embarrassing bad acting. Whoever put this movie together bent over backward to make sure that every shot in the film and every line of dialog spoken was something that could have come from the British TV series of the '60's on which it is based. And much of it could get a seal of approval as far as authenticity goes. Except one gets the distinct feeling that love isn't behind this movie, but rather money. Things may look and sound like the old TV show, but this coldly calculated production totally fails to capture its spirit.\n\nEven though John Steed and Emma Peel are supposed to be meeting for the first time as this picture begins, it is assumed that we viewers know the characters and everything about them already, so the action begins without any delay. Consequently, fifteen minutes into the movie, one feels like they've missed the first hour of the film. Also, one never gets involved in the convoluted plot and never develops any affinity for the characters. Plus, the film is given an obligatory 'Thunderball'-style ending done 1998 style. The old TV show never relied much on things blowing up and this addition here is no improvement.\n\nIn this context it's absolutely impossible for new actors to succeed in the roles of Steed and Mrs. Peel. Whether Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman are doing a good job or not is not easy to tell and irrelevant anyway in this by-the-numbers production. They and Sean Connery (as villain Sir August de Wynter) are merely cyphers in this movie, and when could you ever have said that before about Connery, even if he does wear a bear suit? The one positive thing I can say is that Uma Thurman looks absolutely gorgeous as Mrs. Peel."

The movie Avengers entertain us in a different way, it is more like a theatrical piece on the big screen. I really enjoyed the spoken words in the movie, poems replaced conversations. And all this lingual beauty put in a colorful, amazingly well-made, painting-like cinematography. This movie is like indulging ourselves in the world of beautiful paintings and colors, and literature at the same time. So who cares about any plot?"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Avengers is based on the classic 60's TV series of the same name, which starred Patrick Macnee as well-dressed gentleman secret agent John Steed, and Diana Rigg as his cool, athletic and deadly partner (Mrs.) Emma Peel. Fiennes and Thurman take on the roles for this long awaited big-budget revamp.\n\nThe year is 1999, and the sixties have never ended. When the Prospero Project, which aimed to control the country's weather, is destroyed, all evidence points to the culprit being Dr. Emma Peel, a leading physicist at the institute. The Ministry's top agent, John Steed, is assigned to investigate. Accompanied by Mrs. Peel, they discover a terrible plan concocted by a diabolical mastermind\u0085\n\nFirstly, this film is nowhere near as bad as most critics have said it is. It is fairly disjointed, but that is only because Warners' executives ordered frantic last-minute editing to `pace it up'. They obviously didn't understand the basis of the film, as the utter Englishness and strangeness is part and parcel of the whole concept. Fiennes and Thurman are superb as the leads, although the former is a little too young. The script by Don MacPherson (who like the director and producer is a long time fan) is first class, and the direction is outstanding with Checick capturing to perfection the surreal weirdness that the series is famous for. But it is Sean Connery, as loopy meteorologist Sir August DeWynter, who steals the show. He bounds through the film in overdrive, nutty as squirrel droppings, running off with every scene. Connery is obviously having a ball.\n\nThe movie is a perfect addition to the series, with all of its strengths and only one small concession to Hollywood (I'm not saying what). It is definitely the best film of the year so far: exciting, funny, suspenseful and highly enjoyable. Just one thing though- don't take it too seriously. When you see our two heroes being chased along country lanes by giant robot wasps, you'll know it's all just a bit of fun.\n\nP.S. I don't care what you send in e-mails, or if you firebomb my house, because this film is brilliant and I'll take you all on, in a group or one by one, to prove it!"

The movie , however, seems to hail the Bond films by referencing the best scenes of Goldfinger and Diamonds Are Forever, but not as well done as the originals. Sean Connery, even with a short on-screen time, has a well-rounded plot figured out. Unlike SPECTRE's well-thought out intents, however, Sir August deWinter lacks a motive! The writers, seemingly aware of the eventual demise of the script, apparently decided to perform a literary euthanasia - adding random physics jargon to explain a natural impossibility , introducing an invisible man who relates to the plot in no way whatsoever, and also keeping the dialogue uninteresting, dry, and pointless. In fact, the movie might have had a G rating if it had not been for one use of a disagreeable word edited in during post production. If one ever rents this movie, it would be a much more agreeable experience if one turns the volume down and the screen off. Even Roger Moore makes a better British agent than Ralph (Ray?) Finnes, who is an excellent but poorly cast actor. \"The Ministry\" could never stand up to Her Majesty's Secret Service, which is probably why the actors in the original Avenger's series (much better than the movie) eventually turned to the Bond camp. In short, a good intention killed by studio requisites."

Taking this movie on its own (ahem) merits, one can see how weak and poor it really is.\n\nDon't try to figure out motivation. Too much of the film ended up on the cutting room floor to leave coherent explanations for DeWynter's reasons for doing what he does. The clone of Emma Peel is a loose end we never really understand. (It's simply another contrivance, like so much of the plot of this movie.) And the chemistry between Fiennes and Thurman is difficult to believe.\n\nSadly, the cast is a very talented assortment displaying no talent to speak of. Fiennes and Connery deliver their lines with the strength of a TV movie. And while Uma Thurman makes an attempt at actually acting (with a passable British accent), her performance is underutilized by the laughable direction.\n\nAnd I haven't even compared this to the original TV series. When that is made, you can see this piece of trash for what it really is.\n\nEmma Peel is not a weak or easily intimidated character. The director of this movie thought otherwise. John Steed is not a flat, joyless robot. Apparently, Ralph Fiennes had to interpret Steed in this way as to make him less likeable. The sets did not emphasize the loopy eccentricities made famous in the series. Instead, the feel of the story is incongruous and annoying. And it's revolting if you loved the original series.\n\nI was astonished to see this film being sold in stores for $8 (pre-viewed). Word of mouth made certain it was one to avoid. And to save your time and minimize your revulsion, don't even rent it. Watch the original series and rejoice in that original atmosphere and clever campiness."

All the actors are nice and work well: in particular, of course, Sean Connery as the villain is a treat. There is a good deal of English sense of humor, with its amiable apparatus of bowler-hats, umbrellas, cups of tea, etc. For instance, I liked the perfectly good-mannered talking between people killing each other. There are also some subtleties. A remarkable one: when Thurman tries to escape from Connery's palace, she gets trapped into a sort of mathematical paradox, a homage to Escher's paintings (I fear most audience missed to notice it, though). In my opinion, a fault of the movie is the excess of special effects, which fail to blend with English humor. On the whole, to view \"The Avengers\" is a moderately funny but relaxing way of spending 90 minutes. Possibly, the absence of ultra-violence, sexualities and all that has affected its success, but I will be the very last to blame the director and the producers for this."

The other actors, with the notable exception of Eileen Atkins, actually managed to act well below their dialogue, a feat I would have thought impossible before witnessing it. The confusion of Uma Thurman and Sean Connery attempting to cough out words like \"proton\" and simultaneously nod comprehension must have been somewhat akin to that of the writer, Don MacPherson, while copying words at random from the old middle school science book he'd never read. I came to the conclusion later on that Mr. MacPherson had never played chess, either, so he typed in the only word from the game he knew. \"Checkmate.\"\n\nChess is one of those games that film writers use to make the actors seem, you know, smart.\n\nWhat kind of blackmail, I wonder, did he hold over the producers that they allowed him to make this expensive proof that the stars don't make the movie?\n\nWatching \"The Avengers\" is like watching ten-year-old girls play dress-up, have a tea party, and try to talk like adults.

I thought, if a movie even looked like it might be bad enough to deserve that rating, I wouldn't watch it for long enough to be sure it really was that bad. Until I saw this movie on TV.\n\nIt turns out it's like a road crash. I couldn't take my eyes off it. As a fan of the original TV series, I changed channels pretty quickly when I saw what they had done - attempt to recreate the magical chemistry between Patrick Mcnee and Diana Rigg in the original with leads who had all the chemistry of two inert gases. But I kept switching back to see if it was still as bad. It always was, except when it was worse.\n\nThey would have done much better to cast the 60-year-old Rigg to reprise her TV role. They would probably have done better to cast the much older Mcnee as Stead, even if he had to stay invisible for the whole movie.\n\nSome scenes (like the teddy-bear conference and the Escher staircase) were whimsical enough to have belonged in the TV series. But in the TV series, they would have been part of a consistent theme that was plugged throughout that episode and related to the particular evil villain to be foiled that week, and not just plucked from the air as here.\n\nWorth seeing, perhaps, to know that the art of making truly awful movies has not been lost. I've never seen Manos, Hand of Fate. In Plan 9 from Outer Space, the cast and crew at least deserve credit for trying to the best of their ability. The Avengers would get my vote for the worst move ever made."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Avengers\" (1998), based off the original television series (HOW ORIGINAL, RIGHT?) Bear in mind, I have actually seen a few episodes from the show. Now, I haven't seen all the episodes, but the ones I did see I enjoyed. It's not the best show, however, compared to this horrible \"film\", the original TV series deserves an Academy Award! This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It has a boring story, horrible acting, dated special effects, and a cheap generic soundtrack. The \"story\", or lack thereof, is one of the most unoriginal and uninspired I've seen. Probably the dumbest thing about it is, hardly anything makes sense! There's a man named Mother, a woman named Father, a trained agent lets a woman into a place where no women are allowed, etc. I could go on and on, but we'll be here all day. Don't get me started on the dumb flying bug robots, or the villains in teddy bear costumes! It's like the writer(s) of this \"movie\" were high on drugs when they wrote it, so were the people who produced it! As for the acting, I don't know what to say. It ranges from bad, to over the top. At first glance, the cast looks promising. Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, Sean Connery, Jim Broadbent, and so on. That's quite an all-star cast! But, once again, we have a great cast of actors and actresses, and due to poor writing and direction, their presence could not save this \"movie\". It's such a shame, because these actors have done so much better in other movies! The special effects are dated, and have not aged well. Finally, the soundtrack is cliched and generic. Well, it matches the caliber of this \"movie\"! The only good thing I can miraculously salvage are the sets/locations. You can't go wrong with London, and the surrounding areas in England. One thing to point out though, whenever you see any exterior shots of London in this \"film\", you see little to no people at all! Maybe they heard that they were filming this \"movie\", and evacuated the area? \"The Avengers\" is nothing short of a pile of garbage. This \"film\" is so bad, that it almost made my list of the top 10 worst movies I've ever seen. But, it didn't quite aggravate me enough to qualify. At the end of the day, I'm giving this \"film\" 1 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 2 out of 10 IMDB stars. Stay away from this \"movie\", if you're going to watch \"The Avengers\", stick to the original TV series, or \"The Avengers\" films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, except for \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" (2015) of course. \"The Avengers\" is nothing but a diarrhea stain!"

Never have I seen so many people leave a movie early. Never have I seen objects thrown at the movie screen. This movie was simply horrible. It made no sense. People dressed up as bears for no reason...unreal.\n\nThis is not a Police Academy 6 type movie where I had low expectations going in. We thought this would be good and the makers of this movie intended it to be so. That makes it even more bad.\n\nThis ranks with Speed 2, BattleField Earth, Leonard Part 6 and You Got Served as the worst movies I have ever sat through."

I consider myself literate, appreciate good writing in films, and know and appreciate satire. Not only that, but I frequently enjoy dumb, silly movies, if they are fun, even if they don't always make sense.\n\nThat being said: every aspect of the film version of the Avengers is bad, from Uma Thurman's wooden acting, to the bizarre and nonsensical plot. There are no redeeming points to this movie. None. Its just really bad. Its not even fun to make fun of, its too boring.\n\nThere are people out there who seem to take a perverse pleasure in enjoying (or at least claiming to enjoy) movies that everyone else hates. Its a natural feeling, I guess. If you think something else is brilliant, that no one else likes, it would seem to indicate that you have a deeper level of appreciation of things, than people around you.\n\nMany people like that have written reviews to this movie. I've read a few and they claim things like people have become so benumbed by Hollywood blockbusters that they can't understand what a smart, clever movie this is; or they might claim that people don't understand that it was really supposed to be a campy parody of the spy genre; or (my personal favorite) that people just don't \"get\" this movie.\n\nTake my word for it, there is nothing in \"The Avengers\" for you to get. It is not clever, its not some high concept parody, its just a really, REALLY badly written, acted, and directed movie that I doubt anyone on the production team was happy with after it had been finished.\n\nI was really excited about this movie, and went on opening night. I went in with an open mind, understanding that it had gotten bad reviews. I wanted to like it. I couldn't, it was just too painful, like watching a video of a botched operation.\n\nIf you want to see a good revamping of a spy-show, try watching \"Get Smart.\" If you want a silly, campy movie based on existing material, try watching \"Howard the Duck\" or \"Doc Savage.\" Yes, I liked the movie \"Doc Savage,\" and still think \"The Avengers\" was awful. Trust me on this, you don't want to see \"The Avengers.\""

This one lacked all sense of occasion and this was clear from the very opening shot of R.Fiennes' thin head in a fat bowler hat. With such vicious editing the film had no chance, but even so, I can't think of the most minor fragment of the first 45 minutes that has charmed its way into my memory, except the swivel-headed teddy-bears; but I don't want to give anything away. What I will reveal is that I did walk out, but didn't get wet - just slipped into the showing of Wild things (shown in France under the arresting title of Sexcrimes) in the next screen.

I'm not sure if this movie was meant to be a comedy, because the jokes weren't funny (\"It isn't Mother's day!\") and whenever I laughed it was more out of disbelief than actual enjoyment.\n\nUma Thurman stars as Mrs. Peel, over-acting to the extreme with her unappealing way of making every sentence sound like it was the most important thing she ever said. Ralph Fiennes (selling out) stars as Mr. Steed, our grossly smug super hero who suffers from a perverse addiction to his umbrella. Sean Connory (whatever he was on when he made this, I will never know), intent on destroying whatever credibility he once had, chews the scenery as Sir August the Wynter (huh-huh, get it? Wynter kinda sounds like \"winter\", yuk-yuk-yuk!), evil scientist who manufactures weather.\n\nConsidering the level of the \"gags\" in this \"movie\", I'm surprised they didn't name Connory's character Weatherby E. Ville. As if the overacting of the three leads wasn't enough, the script is horrible, the jokes so awful you'll cry rather than laugh. Classics like the \"drop in\" gag never get old, right? Well, you better believe it. It doesn't help either that the characters look like they're reading from cue cards.\n\nMoving on to the \"WTF\" level of The Avengers, well, it's reached an all-time high. Connory's evil assistants are dressed up as teddy bears in various colours; giant mechanical bees attack our heroes; Uma meets up with an agent who's invisible for no reason at all; an old lady calmly shoots the dickens out of some random people before exclaiming \"I hope they were bad guys\"; our heroes split up inside a labyrinth for no reason at all; Fiennes seduces Uma by changing her boots; the list goes on and on.\n\nWhile this movie is as incompetent as Hollywood gets and a enormous waste of money (60,000,000 dollars! WTF?), it is very funny to watch if you can get over how truly awful it is. Unintentional comedy at its best - or is it intentional? You make up your own mind. Watch this WTF-fest right now!(r#14)"

Pointless treasure maps lying about the place? (Maybe in the ninety's when this was made.) No, but back then they thought they should! Miss Thurman's in the cat suits i mean, come on! Eddie izzard is great as the henchman, Sean Connery is hilarious as sir august Die wynter, Jim broadbent is cleverly casted as 'mother'.

        "review_detailed_main": "The original Avengers series is one of the best TV series ever made. It mixed spy intrigue with weird, surreal plots & settings, putting two eccentric heroes against even more eccentric villains. So it was with high expectations fans waited for this movie.\n\nBut something terrible happened. Test screenings Warners Bros. did for their stylish adaptation of \"The Avengers\" (based on the color episodes with Patrick \"John Steed\" MacNee and Diana \"Mrs. Peel\" Rigg) were disastrous; for whatever reason, the audience - many of which had probably never seen episodes of the series and had likely expected something different - just didn't \"get it\". Audience response was reportedly pretty negative, to say the least.\n\nThe people at WB panicked and in an effort to somehow make the movie more \"accessible\" (or whatever) and speed it up somewhat, some 30 minutes(!) of footage (maybe more, I don't have exact figures) were cut. Which, unsurprisingly, shows in the final version. Plot elements - like the mysterious \"evil twin\" of Emma Peel, and the real Mrs. Peel's knowledge of the password that gained them entrance to Sir August DeWynter's lair - are suddenly left unexplained. What we got was basically an incomplete movie.\n\nWhich is a shame, of course, especially since there are so many good things about it. The movie is actually very faithful to the series.\n\nThe surreal settings, like the strangely empty streets of London, for example, or the delightfully deranged teddy bear meeting; the scene with the stairs in DeWynter's castle, the rural English village that's actually a training ground for secret agents...\n\nWhile it is impossible to replace the on-screen charisma & presence of the original actors, in my opinion Ralph Fiennes was decent as John Steed, albeit probably a bit too young for the part. Uma Thurman was good as Mrs. Peel; the movie version was maybe too perfect, being better at everything than Steed, which was overdoing it a bit. But in some scenes another side of her was revealed, showing feelings of insecurity on her part which nicely balanced out the otherwise flawless character. A nice psychological touch, I think (she might be trying to excel at things to make up for that insecurity, etc.)...\n\nCasting Sean Connery - the \"original spy\", James Bond - as the villain, was an interesting idea. Some more insight in the character would have been nice, but that may be because of the unfortunate \"editing\"... Apart from that, he looked great in that teddybear suit. :)\n\nFor the rest: the movie had a nice Bond-style intro (and a nice Bond-style song by Grace Jones at the end), music was very nice, production design was great, a \"60's meets the nineties\" look which was a nice touch; SFX were good. There were cameos by stand up comedian Eddie Izzard, and the lead singer (can't remember his name) I believe, of that pop group the Happy Mondays(?) as henchmen of DeWynter. Speaking of cameos, Patrick MacNee, the original John Steed, makes an unseen appearance as \"Invisible\" Jones.\n\nFinal word, part 1: entertaining, not bad at all, but could have been so much better (it is incomplete; we need a director's cut!); if you are a fan of the TV series, or even if you're not, check this movie out, you might find you like it. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\nFinal word, part 2: test screenings are, in my opinion, a Bad Idea. (Thanks to the wonder of test screenings we got the infamous \"happy ending\" and voice-over tacked on to \"Blade Runner\", to name a good example...) Let's face it: test audiences almost destroyed this movie."

I'd had enough. I just couldn't stomach another minute of it.\n\nDo yourself a favour and don't ever consider renting this. Or if you are suffering from insomnia, this will help, or if you are finding that you lack motivation at the gym and need something to help bring your anger out, this will do fine as well, or if you are short on toilet tissue.......\n\nLet's just put it this way, I have never been in better shape in my life. When I workout now, I just think of how mad I was that I spent 10 bucks on this film and suddenly the weight feels much lighter.\n\nGet the point, this is a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad, cheesy movie that belongs right up there with Plan 9 From Outer Space."

Poor casting all round, though Fiennes was possibly the best match there. Therman was simply terrible as Mrs Peel. Who ever thought she could do subtle yet commanding sexy should be in therapy. Yes, filling Diana Riggs shoes has to be one of the hardest jobs out there but there has to be a thousand better choices out there than Uma Therman (inc. Diana Riggs won daughter who is incredibly talented). Unbelievably bad casting. Please if someone out there is thinking of doing another remake a few years down the track please make it an entirely British production (inc. Cast) You can almost be assured that it will be better than this one.\n\nI almost feel ill thinking about this movie."

This was the first one I ever truly wanted to walk out on before the credits came on. It was really that bad. Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes had zero chemistry and the dialogue was in a word crap! The film was too long. There was no back story for their characters and the first half of the movie was agonizingly drawn out for no good reason. Even when Sean Connery finally came on to the screen it was too late to save this piece of manure. I have never ever been so happy to see the climatic final act, not because it was good, but because it meant the end of the movie was agonizingly close. I did not care for this film and I hope my $11.00 was hopefully put to good use. Hopefully for the director and screenwriter to go back to school and learn how to make a good movie. After 24 yrs I can finally release my frustration and disappointment of this film. Thanks for that!"

Gadgets are weird yet working and look quite outlandish, the storyline propels making no real sense, and it's all like one big sophisticated funny stylish dream. Don't even try to follow the story too much. Enjoy the dialogue with its dry wit, humor one could righteously call british. Watch the settings and enjoy the details and the atmosphere the movie builds up, and get dragged into that world.

        "review_detailed_main": "Firstly I feel I ought to say that this film isn't quite as bad as some people make out. Don't get me wrong, relative to the series this film is an outrage not so much failing to capture the magic of the original as dancing on its grave. What could have been a whole series of campy-surreal Avengers flicks produces instead only this choppy mess. There are some fun moments - none involving Sean Connery - the sets look fabulous, the soundtrack is excellent and it's always lovely to see Fiona Shaw and Eileen Atkins whatever they are doing. That this movie is such an appalling mish-mash with only a very few scenes indicating the original intention to make a decent movie is I believe entirely down to the terrifyingly bad judgement shown by the film's director Jeremiah Chechik, perhaps (indeed for his sake hopefully) under duress from Warner Bros.\n\nThe selection of Chechik himself to handle such a big project given his relatively undistinguished career seems eccentric, perhaps it was felt that as a Canadian he might have an inside track on a series whose distinctive British quality might have made the suits uneasy. However like Lee Tamahori he shows very little understanding of the way the series actually works and his directing of Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman is hamfisted enough to ruin the film on its own. Steed, supposed to be witty, urbane, charming and warm is reduced to a man who emotes less than the furniture in his chic London pad. Mrs. Peel is simply a mess - with no real explanation given for her behaviour in the script Uma Thurman's performance lurches to different extremes from scene to scene like a drunk playing hopscotch.\n\nThe real villain here, however, is Sean Connery. Not, I'm afraid to say in the film, in which he delivers one the worst performances of his already one-note career but in the effect that his casting had on the script. In early drafts the character of Sir August Merryweather (as he is called) was a harmless old buffer, the real villain being someone else entirely and the plot hingeing on the death of Mrs Peel's husband thus giving her some sort of motivation and explaining why at the start of the film she is no longer running the Prospero Weather Programme.\n\nThe studio executives, salivating at the fact that Connery was interested in the script ripped it to shreds to find a role to accommodate him. When the film was screened before test audiences they reacted badly to its eccentricity, the lousy direction of the two leads, the fact that Connery was terrible and the new plot involving him incoherent. The studio's solution was another celluloid massacre performing big cuts making the already messy film a total disaster.\n\nWhat I find most disappointing in this movie is that there are just enough moments in it to realise that what you are actually watching is the corpse of a good film and that a splendid opportunity to revive a bit of British telly history has been comprehensively ruined. The cut footage may have made things better but really, aside from a good early draft of a script, there is nothing here for anyone involved to be proud of. What a shame. Sixty million dollars of shame in fact."

They could have actually used some of the older Avengers' scripts and made a movie out of it. The movie takes awhile to get going because Steed and Peel aren't acquainted yet. The only thing that was halfway decent was a remix of the old Avengers theme song. There's really nothing to see here. I gave it a 4 or of 10 and that's really being generous. Hollywood need to stop with these remakes. Mission Impossible. The Day The Earth Stood Still. I heard they were doing a Mod Squad remake next. Uuhhgg!! Stay away."

Worst Moment of Desperation: Uma Thurman repeatedly throwing herself against a series of walls, trying to escape (come to think of it, I was doing that myself in the theatre) Worst Sense of Humor: The Whole Cast and Crew (who, apparently, either never saw an episode of the original Avengers, or didn't get the joke if they did.)\n\nThis film got a \"1\" from me because zero was not an option: but I can tell you it isn't worth the celluloid it's committed to.

To begin with, the film is not good, but it is not so disastrous for the bad reputation it has acquired. Unfortunately, the chemistry between Una Thurman and Ralph Phines did not work out despite the fact that each one was perfect for the role separately, I understand that Warner did not have confidence in this product and they modified it several times, so their argument became something strange, To make matters worse, in many countries it was not even released in theaters, but was released directly on DVD, which caused a wave of hatters who thought in advance that the film was bad. The most salvageable thing for me is that the writer printed several scenes in honor of the original series and these homages were very clear, like the scene with the flying insects inspired by the Small Game for Big Hunters episode or the scene of Emma Peel locked in a house where the stairs always led to the same place, in homage to the great episode The House That Jack Built, among others."

        "review_detailed_main": "The film's principal flaw is that it's too silly. Silliness in moderation, of course, was one of the hallmarks of the \"Avengers\" TV series, and everyone loved it. The movie goes off the deep-end with it, alas, offering up a cadre of criminal scientists dressed in teddy-bear costumes, radio-controlled helicopters shaped like giant insects, a retail establishment that sells \"weather,\" and an invisible man. A story that taxes our belief a little less would have been better; there is enough humor in the script without it having to resort to Romper-Room-style science-fiction. (One could argue that the original TV show did the same sorts of things, but what plays in one decade as tongue-in-cheek risks being embarrassing for audiences thirty years later. The film's silliness wasn't properly upgraded for the nineties.)\n\nSean Connery's part could have been played by anyone. That's not a criticism of Connery; it's of the part. It calls for a man who can look arrogant and speak assertively. It doesn't call for anything that Connery has to offer, not for his fine-tuned blend of suaveness and ruthlessness, not for his confidence or good looks, not for his size or strength, not for his screen presence, nothing. It doesn't even particularly call for being British. The writers created a generic character and then picked Sean Connery to play it for box-office draw. It didn't work.\n\nThe only other thing that irks is that the film tries to force-feed us feminism. That just isn't necessary any more. In fact, it was barely necessary on the old TV show. The old Steed and Peele operated in an almost Scully-and-Mulder fashion, in which gender-equality is assumed and doesn't have to be shoved down our throats. They supported the feminist ideal by practicing it rather than preaching it. The movie, on the other hand, feels compelled to have Mrs. Peele demonstrate her superiority to Steed in every scene, at swordsmanship, at chess, at science, you name it. At times, Steed even comes across as a bit of a jerk - not the Avengers that I knew and loved. Hey, film writers: we all know that women can do anything men can do. How about relaxing with that fact and enjoying it . . . instead of constantly proselytizing it?\n\nSome good points: Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes realize the roles wonderfully. There is much subtle humor in the dialogue, and just the right amount of sexual tension in their interaction. Thurman exudes the same matter-of-fact confidence that Diana Rigg gave Emma Peel. Fiennes is the perfect gentleman warrior, able to defeat whole armies of villains with his umbrella. Thurman was never more beautiful. Also, I was delighted by the musical score's tribute to \"Laurie\" Johnson's original music from the TV show, still as lush and sophisticated as it was in the sixties.\n\nAnd yes, that was Patrick Macnee's voice as the invisible Colonel Jones. Why no cameo for Diana Rigg, I wonder?"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is it: one of the most notorious critical failures in blockbuster history. This film promises a hip, new, action-packed rendition of the classic British spy show: a slick hybrid of explosive action, thrills, and quirky humor.\n\nThe film definitely tries its best to be quirky, to the point where nearly every scene is weird and off-the-wall. Such eccentricities include a council of villains who dress up as giant teddy bears. There are at least a couple of scenes where old ladies whip out throwing knives or machine guns. The heroes are chased by robot bees at one point. One of the characters has an evil clone, with no explanation as to how or why. There are oodles of other odd things going on here, but the film pushes its quirkiness over the top with its script, in which every single line is a pun. Seriously, nobody ever talks normally in this film: every line is a funny remark, and it can get old really fast. The spaces in between these odd parts are filled up with fighting, explosions, chases, fighting, explosions, fighting, and more fighting! My personal experience with this film has always been mixed; it's something I always wanted to like, but never could. The standard tropes of outlandish spy thrillers are there, and the action can be okay to watch at times. Unfortunately, the storytelling makes this a far duller experience, because there is no real story here to tell. With a whopping 28 minutes cut from the film in post-production, the plot is reduced to a constant string of action scenes, one after another, with zero character development, and zero reasoning given for why things happen on screen. In the end, it's hard to really latch onto this film beyond the aesthetics.\n\nAnd the aesthetics get the job done. Photography isn't too bad. Editing is pretty stupid. Everybody in this film hams up their performances to match the quirky nature of the film. Ralph Fiennes bears a crud-eating grin the whole time, but still manages to channel enough charm and wit to make the most out of what he's given. Uma Thurman is pretty much reprising her role as Poison Ivy from B&R. Sean Connery doesn't seem to give a flying rip about anything, and in spite of that he seems to be the only one here taking his role seriously, even when he struts around in a kilt. I have no idea what Jim Broadbent and Eddie Izzard are doing here. Writing is horrible. This production uses okay-looking sets, props, and costumes. Special effects have not aged well. Joel McNealy's score is annoyingly repetitive and loud (which is a shame, because the movie's theme is not bad per se, and the CD soundtrack has been a favorite of mine since high school).\n\nThere may have been potential in this film somewhere, but so much of the story has been carved out in post-production that it leaves only a threadbare semblance of a plot, and a ton of frivolous action and ridiculous scenes. It's an interesting oddity at times, and a glorious guilty pleasure in its own right, but overall, it is the ultimate example of how a film with all style and no substance can fall flat on its face.\n\n2/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Awful | Film: Marginal)"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Avengers\" 1998 film is a moderately enjoyable and entertaining yarn which held my attention and was better than the dire reviews suggested. While it is certainly not a great movie, with the sometimes rough cinematography being the weak point in my mind, it is still watchable and makes a decent effort at turning the 1960's British TV show into a feature length film. It's unfortunate that this film wasn't more popular because I would have loved to see a series of Avengers films as I am a big fan of the TV show and characters. Of course this film couldn't fully recapture the magic of the original TV show, but who could really replace Patrick MacNee and Diana Rigg with their great manner and chemistry? But Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman do a decent job of trying and Sean Connery seems to be relishing his role as the villain. I do wonder if some of the low reviews have to do with the viewers being unfamiliar with the original TV show and its 1960's British television style that features an inimitable mixture of camp, humor, mystery, and mystique. For example, the scene where Emma runs in circles in the mansion always coming back to the same spot was lifted directly from an episode of the original TV show. In summary, I rate this film a 6/10. If you're interested in it, just go ahead and see it, don't let the low reviews dissuade you, but as said it's not a great film, hence the 6/10. Also, I liked the plot about a villain controlling the weather with electromagnetic waves; it was appropriately bombastic for an Avengers movie and yet is probably currently more fact than fiction, perhaps that is why it was so severely panned by the establishment."

I should have known not to expect much from Uma Thurman after her embarrassing performance in Batman Forever, but I was sure that masters Sean Connery and Ralph Fiennes would deliver. Sadly, even they could not salvage the monotonous screenplay and virtually nonsensical plot. The few scenes which may have illicited a chuckle were generally overdone, and gratuitously repeated throughout the movie. Even the relationship between Steed and Peel was implausible and sterile. I prayed desperately for it all to come together in the end, but by the time the credits rolled, I was left with only numb confusion and bleak disappointment.

Two good actors, Fiennes and Thurman, are drastically mis-cast as Steed & Peel, and deliver performances so insipid, lacklustre & constipated that I keep wondering whether anyone involved with the movie had EVER experienced the original series AT ALL. There are a few moments where this dead-on-arrival remake pleases - a few moments, and minor. I loved seeing Sean Connery as the bad guy in his lab in the dark, his eyes shifting back & forth greedily, actually take on a truly Karloffian aspect (which has nothing to do with the original show, but IS a lovely moment). Fans of the original series may catch the identity of the voice-actor for the pipe-smoking Invisible Jones. Jim Broadbent-lovers will smile to see him cast as \"Mother\", the ministry official whom Steed reports to. And one of Mother's other agents, Alice, unexpectedly brings back the feel of supporting cast characters from the original. And so on. But to sit through the whole thing just for these few bits, continually irked by the wrong-wrong- wrong mis-acting by its stars, is absurd. There is one other moment where things perked up: Steed is covertly ambling through the bad guy's huge estate when he hears a telephone ringing, and sees, incongruously, a bright red antique phonebooth a ways off, under a canopy of trees. As he approaches it, the wind picks up - and mounts to gale force. He takes refuge in the phonebooth, the winds roaring violently all about it, & answers the phone. He can just barely hear a recorded voice scoding him for being on private property. My little recap doesn't do it justice, but that moment in the film did recapture the kind of disorienting atmosphere so often produced evoked by the original show. In a nutshell, if you knew the original, you should pass this re-make- de-make by."

Now this could work if the editing just took out long unneeded scenes but according to the director key parts of the movie were cut. On watching Avengers you can visibly see this, scenes jump to new scenes with no explanation & often make no sense whatsoever leaving the audience confused.

As a fan of the original series it seemed all wrong in so many ways. Anyway out of curiosity I bought it on DVD to have anther look and it is actually rather good - it seems to have been improved by time. Rather like a cheap bottle of plonk which has surprisingly matured into a rather fine vintage. So what is better now? Firstly the theme of a lunatic madman trying to control the world's weather has a timely resonance it perhaps didn't have 10 years ago. Climate change topicality aside what was enjoyable was the self consciously clipped and pun laden dialogue between Peel and Steed. 10 years ago we all hated both depictions as somehow not being true to the original but what one realises is that this is two people very knowingly playing (with) the parts and dialogue in a way which is a perfect update and seems to really work now The humour and irony are very nicely understated - it pulls off that all but impossible combination of parody and thriller in a way Bond used to do before it went all machismo.. The only real shame is that it is so short. So if you if you saw it before and hated it - perhaps try again you may be pleasantly surprised."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film was a definite disappointment for a fan of the original series. However I didn't expect too much of an American remake of a classic 1960's British TV series- particularly one that made so much of its exaggerated Englishness.\n\nProbably this was as close to the original as could be expected. After all even the New Avengers series of the early 1970's had lost the spirit of the original series.\n\nThe much-criticised Teddy bears scene was a classic Avengers gimmick - people who criticised this scene either never saw the original, or more seriously, didn't understand that The Avengers is understated English comedy. It was never meant to be taken seriously.\n\nThe special effects were in fact good, and did not detract from the film in any way. Perhaps people were expecting more fireballs and devastating explosions. There was little of that in the 1960's series.\n\nOne weakness was the dialogue. It was superficially similar to the original. But it didn't sound authentic when spoken by the leads. Fiennes was a fairly convincing Steed, and sounded reasonably authentic, but not so Thurman. There was no way an American could sound like Diana Rigg. I suppose they did as well as could be expected in the circumstances.\n\nThe moral has to be that it is a mistake to try to recreate a programme from another era and country. The result can never be very happy."

Whilst they may appreciate its success, they don't understand what actually made it good. This is Connery's worst movie since Sword Of The Valint, some fifteen years earlier. Quite a feat considering that Highlander 2 and King Arthur are in there.\n\nI watched this with my 11 year old son why questioned if it was a spoof movie, before stating \"I can't watch this\" before walking off. I turned it off shortly after to return to later in the day. Again I turned it off.\n\nTruthfully writing this review is taking some doing. It just fails on every level.\n\nThe Movie was a bomb, only grossing $23 million of its $60 million budget at the domestic box office, to end 1998 as the 77th highest grossing movie of the year."

As a kid, I remember watching the Avengers, and then \"The New Avengers\" which followed. Neither of these series sucked (although the \"New\" Avengers had some stupid episodes) and neither series deserved to have such a crappy big-screen adaptation made of it.\n\nSometimes, when you watch a film adaption of a book or TV series, you can be struck by how much the actors have captured the parts they play and made them their own. In other words, how perfect they are for the roles. In \"Avengers\" exactly the opposite occurs. Fiennes is totally miscast as Steed and Thurman is, well......far too.....well...just too wrong for words as Mrs Peel.\n\nDespite the stupid action sequences and woefully wrong actors. Despite the attempted forced chemistry between Fiennes and Thurman, and the lousy dialogue that emerged, this film could have survived and been a reasonable, if poor adaptation of a great old series.\n\nWhere it descended into total farce, at least for me, was the \"Council of Teddy Bears\" scene, wherein Sean Connery and his evil henchmen discuss their evil plot whilst wearing full body teddy-bear suits. I didn't get any of the lines, I was laughing so hard. As if that wasn't enough, there then followed a chase/fight scene involving the \"bear\" and our heroes. It was just diabolically, ridiculously bad. BAD! I say!\n\nI think that particular part of the film will rate (along with the draught-excluder snake wrestling scene from the King Kong remake) as my all time most pitiful movie scene.\n\nIf you want to ruin a good name, just get some inappropriate actors and a rubbish script and mix them together. Et voila! The Avengers is born......or rather dies a horrible, screaming death that, had I not seen the original series on which it was based, would have ensured that I wouldn't ever watch an episode of the original on rerun. Gods! Even Conan the Destroyer wasn't as bad as this, and that had Grace Jones in it, for goodness sake!\n\nTake my advice...If you are a fan of the series, give this a wide berth and spare your fond memories the beating that mine took."

        "review_title": "A very successful film adaptation of the 60 's show",
        "review_detailed_main": "When I first saw the Avengers I thought it was a messy movie , not necessarily bad , but hard to follow and with very little to recommend , like a few good lines such as \" Isn 't there a Mrs Steed ? \" \" Yes there is.... my mother ! \" . Unfortunately the confusing plot made the film an endless stream of scattered scenes and streched the time slot from the mere 85 minutes to an experience which lasted more than 2 hours in the mind of the viewer . Everybody bashed this film and I believe they had their reasons. Everybody praised the TV show as \"brilliant\" , \"wonderful\" and \"tasteful\". When the public network decided to broadcast reruns I sat down with high expectations to see this long lost TV series ....... What the h**l was THAT ????? Most of the episodes were load of c**p (the Time Machine for example), literally unbearable to watch !!!!!!!!! Very few episodes were interesting , witty and campy in a good way , like the 10 Little Niggers rip off or the episode where Mrs Peel was kidnapped by insane film makers who wanted to make her the star of their movie before killing her . Other episodes were so - so , \"cute\" storylines like \"The Bird who knew too much \" , the \"Winged Avenger \" , the \"Invisible Man\" or the episode with the Nanny Academy . But as I said the majority of the show is nothing but a waste of money and film. Did anyone actually LIKE THIS ??? And I watched the so called \"best\" colourful episodes with Mrs Peel !!! As for the Patrick MacNee - Diana Rigg so called \"chemistry\" ??? Non - existing ! Mac Nee was as stiff as an ice cube and Rigg although has a kittenish charm it failed to reach any acceptor because Mac Nee had the erotism of Hercules Poirot ! Believe me even if you drilled deep deep deep down the MacNee - Rigg relationship it is more possible to find oil deposits than even the least trace of a remotely mild \"sub-erotic\" chemistry ! Not even the most unconfessed one , like Linda Hammilton with her colleaque (I thing he was called Joe) in \"Beauty and the Beast\" or even Jodie Foster with Anthony Hopkins in \"Silence of the Lambs\" !! On top of that there are the infamous carate kicks of Mrs Peel , which (you have to trust me) are ATROCIOUSLY bad . I don 't think there are words in the English language to express how HORRIBLE and unconvincingly directed these \"fight\" scenes were . This classic series is just a P.O.S. No wonder I had never heard of the Avengers before the movie came out !!! (in contrast with other campy 60's shows like Lost in Space or Batman who retained their reputation throughout time) . The filmic Avengers were a masterpiece compared to their ancestor !!\n\nNevertheless I decided to rewatch the film believing that the second time would be more entertaining . Boy was I right !!!! Now that I knew the plot 's surprises this wonderful satire was highly enjoyable . Everything fits in to place , everything makes more sense , we manage to learn the predicament and the motives of all the characters . Not only the pace is fast moving , not only the plot unfolds with a very composed way , not only the hilarious dialogue delivers A-list British phlegm to the screen ( \" Join me and we 'll rule the world \" \"You didn't say please !\" )but we manage to watch some of the most original and inventive surrealistic sets a film has ever brought us. Many have praised the Escher-esque eternal stairs where Mrs Peel is trapped but I will stick to : the greenhouse with a pleiad of plants or the musical kist of whistles along with a jewlery collection in Sir August 's manor .\n\nThe film 's negative points are : Emma Peel is turned more into a victim instead of a more active part and Stead is authorised to kill her if he suspects that she is the leak . On top of that the subplot with Emma 's dark side ( I won 't say more ) should be shortened because it got annoying . The good points : further than the impressive sets and some good SFX (like the snow blizzard) the casting was very successful . Sure Ralph Fiennes was a bit young for the shoes of John Stead but he had all the qualifications for the role . A charming English gentleman , cool tempered and mild mannered , but not deadpan or emotionless , and with the hidden energy of an inert volcano . Uma Thurman was a PERFECT choise for Emma Peel as she had the deadly beauty required . And YES the two leads have the much needed chemistry that their predecessors failed to reach . Oh , their acting skills ? Just as moderate as they SHOULD be . Remember they are British agents and this is a British inspired satire , not your typical adrenaline pumped American blockbuster with explosions and car chases (yes there is a car chase but very different from the usual ones : the pursuers are giant mechanical bees !!) . As for Sean Connery ? Although the script didn 't do Sir August DeWinters full justice , Connery makes a pleasantly memorable and decent job as the bad guy . Remember again : this is NOT your ordinary summer roallercoaster and if Connery stole the show the movie would have failed . The action scenes are wonderfully directed , since Stead kicks a** with his umbrella and Mrs Peel does a fine job with her carate kicks and when she sword fights with Stead .\n\nOverall the Avengers is a much welcome witty satire of the American spy films like James Bond and action / destruction blockbusters generally (like Armageddon) . It is charismatic and eccentric in a very positive way . If only the producers hadn't chop it by editing out so many scenes we would have even more entertainment like the plastic transport bubbles or the deliciously quirky sets in the weather controlling headquarters with black and white colours and weird cross linked architecture . I hope we will have a director 's cut some day . Sit back relax and enjoy the Avengers . It is a great cinematic experience and if you find it lame just give it a second shot (much like the surrealistic Batman Returns) . It has top British phlegm and I believe the main theme and point of the film is summarised in a very characteristic line (I can't say in which point in order not to spoil it ) \" MANNERS , Mrs Peel !!\" =) Wonderful sets , costumes , cinematography , the familiar music theme and an intelligent script give a good mix . One special benefit is that (despite the use of computers and electronic gizmos) you can't easily designate the time period of the events since the atmosphere mixes various stylistic elements and is reminiscent of a fairy tale .\n\nSoon to become a cult classic the Avengers is vastly underrated but it will grow in the public 's heart as time goes by . A definite\n\n8 / 10"

The show had a uniquely offbeat, playful quality about it. Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg were always suave and never labored as the leads. Unfortunately the new movie is overblown and labored, and misses the quirky tone of the original. The fault is not with the stars, who try mightily -- maybe too mightily -- to seem suave and offhand.\n\nOne big problem is that the movie has Steed and Peel meet early in the movie. In the TV series it seemed like they had been together for years and knew each other intimately -- but not in the physical sense. In the movie Steed spends about half the time wondering if Mrs. Peel is really an evil assassin. The teasing dynamic that was so important in the serie is totally destroyed here.\n\nRalph Fiennes and Uma Thurman certainly look their parts. Sean Connery is mostly wasted as the evil genius bent on controlling the world's weather. The only character who strikes the right note of deadly nonchalance is Eileen Atkins' middle-aged, machine gun wielding Alice, who should have been in the movie more.\n\nThere's a nice chase involving giant robot wasps, and a few amusing moments. All in all, not too bad if you need to spend 90 minutes out of the heat, but a disappointment to those of us who loved the show."

I wish they could of taken more time to develop the relationship dialogue with those two, it would of brought more power to the film. Yet Sean Connery's role was very well done. The use of the special effects to produce the weather was admirable. I felt that because of the no early release, critics seem to damn this film early. I thought it was above average..."

It did have the Steed-Peel imitations down - but it just wouldn't stop! It kept going, and going.... Connery was a good choice but he gave away the story too quick. Peel walks up to him and he goes, \"Hello Mrs. Peel, I'm the villain.\" Peel's clone: too convenient. Winter's partner, Father: too convenient (an inside job, how original!) And was anyone else as annoyed as I at the end where there were close-ups after close-ups of Mother (and his dandruff, yuck). Why? I want to see Peel. But the camera was in love with Mother, why? Is there a God? The movie should of started how it ended, with the terrible twisters and unyielding weather. The world's in peril and Steel and Peel must save us. There will be no sequel.

Unfortunately,too many people who do not understand what made the series charming and stylish and classy, must have had a hand in this film, because it lost its way during the opening credits. Literally. Is this yet another example of studio executives creating their own ulcers by meddling in business for which they have no understanding or natural talent ? The dialogue was disastrous; written by someone who thought they had captured the glib repartee of the series, but doesn't have the talent to tell if they did or not. That problem plus the terribly unfortunate miscasting are the two downfalls of the picture. If Mr. Fiennes tested for the part, he would not have been hired by anyone who loved the characters of Steed and Mrs. Peel, or who understood and loved The Avengers, the series. Miss Thurman, I believe, could have been an asset to the film if, in other hands, it were made with an actor who gave her something other than wax to play against. The Avengers, in the hands of those who made this version, is gravely moribund. I'm afraid there is naught but to put this English patient to sleep."

Connery doesn't put much effort into his role, but then none of the cast is all that good...though you do get to see Uma in a rather nice costume.

Lying somewhere between Bond and Austin Powers, The Avengers, for mine, captures the best elements from both.\n\nStylish to the extreme, The Avengers never lets trivial things like plot and reality get in the way of having a good time. Steed and Peel seem more interested in where the next cup of tea is coming from, than saving the world from a diabolical baddy.\n\nThe protagonists are provided wonderfully by Fiennes and Thurman. Not so much like the originals, but rather exaggerated versions of them. With their arch delivery and restrained manner, it isn't so much about what they say, but how they say it. Both cut stunning figures in (and out) of various costumes. Their roving eyes are subtle but unmistakable.\n\nConnery turns up for over-the-top bad guy duties and relishes the chance to act like a complete loon. When uttering such priceless gems as; \"one should never fear, being wet\", Connery is as strangely disturbing as he is funny.\n\nAs previously mentioned, The Avengers is on style overload. This is provided across the board from the polished cinematography to the snazzy music. Check out the marvellous credit sequence, for just a taster.\n\nTrouble only strikes the film, when as Hollywood necessitates, the climatic fight between Fiennes and Connery comes around. In reaching for big spectacle, the result is unfortunately sluggish. The charming closing scenes recover what was lost however, and left me thirsty for more.\n\nThe Avengers has certainly proven to be a film that doesn't please everyone. The public and critics alike, unsure how to take it's quirky, low-key nature, have reacted with vitriol. But as the many wise and thoughtful comments on this message board (in amongst the inane) prove, there is an audience for this film. An intelligent audience, that will be enjoying this film long after the majority of vacant, big budget, Hollywood nonsense has been forgotten."

There are a few lapses (mercifully, the obligitory car chase was short, and there was only one), but on the whole I could easily imagine the dialogue being spoken by Patrick MacNee and Diana Rigg. Indeed, I sometimes wished it were. Ralph Fiennes had the proper British air about him, and Uma Thurman played the role well, but neither had the proper air of restained impishness that I remember.\n\nThat, however, is a quibble. If you enjoyed Mr. Steed and Mrs. Peel before, by all means, try this one out. And if the reviews are awful, chances are, the reviewer was never a fan."

No kidding, Connery is just plain bad camping it up and walking around in a teddy bear suit (don't ask).

Not even Uma's worth going to see - she isn't even given a chance and one of the most pleasant actresses to look at isn't seen enough to make this film even remotely good.

The characters (and I DO mean ALL OF THEM) were dull, uninspired, vapid. Somewhere between people and cartoon characters, with the lustre of neither. The action is anticipated, as there's nothing else to look forward to, and then the action arrives with a dull thud! The dialogue.....Now, I'm old enough to have seen the original airings of the TV show, and can appreciate the attempt of the writers to simulate the sort of dry, yet snappy reparte and subtle sexual tension between John Steed and Emma Peele, but sadly, it not only fell far short of campy TV offering, the dialogue was so flat and understated that you were never quite sure whether they ever even spoke to one another. Visually? One word....blah. I won't even attempt to give creedence to the story line (what story line?)\n\nSo, in short, nothing to look at, nothing to listen to, nothing to think about. On my way out of the theater, (before the credits had a chance to roll) I turned to the guy behind me.... \"Is it me, or was that just awful?\" I asked. After a short fit of laughter, he replied \"I can't believe how bad it was. I'm never going to another film based on the premise that it has great special effects.

There! I don't freaking care about all the negative criticism this film gets because most of the time it's from people who have never seen the series in the first place.\n\nThe original Avengers was done with a very very small budget. Because of that sets were very simple (but extremely original), there were no extras or backdrop actors (London always seemed deserted) and some of the actors came up with their own costumes (like Patrick MacNee). The stories were always extravagant and brilliant. The wit and the humor very British.\n\n'The Avengers', the movie, captured that oh so typical Avengers style and feel. Mrs Peel drives through a deserted British capital, the villain is extravagant, the sets colorful and original, etc....\n\nAlthough the story has big holes (huge scenes were just edited out) I still enjoyed it. The cinematography is fantastic (just like one big Magritte painting), the music super cool and the actors did a good at recreating one of the best tv series in television history ....\n\nSo stop reading all those bad reviews and go see this movie!!!"

WHY?! I'll tell you why!\" and launches into the full-scale plan. I really didn't see a full explanation as to why DeWinter was so hep on taking over the world.\n\n2) The Stupid Science\n\nJust about every plot device using some sort of gadget has stupid science behind it, meaning there are enough holes in the scientific explanation to drive a truck through, yet it kinda makes sense and could actually work. Or so you're led to believe. I must have missed something in \"The Avengers\" about how DeWinter's weather devices worked. Apparently, they did because he said so.\n\nThose points aside, I found the film version a drag. Mrs. Peel and Steed's exchanges didn't come across as sharp and witty; they bordered on catty and bitchy. There were too many times where Mrs. Peel was vulnerable, as in \"I need a hug\". Both characters, when they weren't sipping tea (THAT got tired in a hurry!), were flat and emotionless. The only clever thing was how they crossed the Thames (I won't reveal this for the people who haven't seen it). Overall, it seemed like the movie was written by somebody who was relying on the oral history of the show, rather than watching about 20 episodes and studying it."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Avengers\" could have been a megahit. Certainly, the production values are there. Thankfully, the movies showcases Laurie Johnson's original theme, unlike so many film versions of TV series. However, o say the casting could have been better is to put it mildly. Uma Thurman acquits herself reasonably well, but comes across more as a hybrid of Catherine Gale and Emma Peel. Angelina Jolie, Sela Ward, Amanda Donohue or Cameron Diaz would have been much better choices and I could even see Halle Berry in the part. However, Ralph Fiennes is a total dud as John Steed. He lacks Patrick McNees' droll humor and charm and has absolutely no chemistry with Thurman. Rupert Everett or Hugh Grant would have been much better choices.\n\nIt is nearly impossible to judge the script, as it is clear miles of film were left on the cutting room floor. However, several scenes that were clearly meant as homages to the original simply come across as obvious clich\u00e9s. Clearly overlooked by the writers and producers was that original AVENGERS scripts were great MYSTERIES. Even if the script weren't so obvious, hiring a superstar like Sean Connery as prime suspect is pretty lame. I mean, who else could the villain be? Whatever mystery was not squandered in the obvious script was erased in the preview trailers. Pity, because I would love to see another high caliber AVENGERS vehicle, something with the same degree of excellence as the episodes with Patrick McNee and Diana Rigg or even of the caliber of the NEW AVENGERS with Patrick McNee and Joanna Lumley.\n\nI give THE AVENGERS a strong \"4\" for the production values, music, stunts and the memories, faint as they may be."

Because of that it was a flop.\n\nBut for those of us that don't cringe in horror over the thought of going to an art museum, the movie is beautiful and done in a way that most of the artist-directors out there can only dream of.\n\nIt looks brilliant, it looks like moving art on the screen and the dialogue fits perfectly into that mold. It is the surreal film that puts so many others to shame.\n\nThe only fault it has is the marketing. It was marketed for the Rambo crowd that want nothing more to see the blood and carnage, the over-the-top science fiction special effects that has aliens blow up the White House.\n\nInstead you get Surrealist special effects and killer teddy bears. They hit the mark well, but only for those of you that real enjoy that sort of thing.\n\nIf you walk into The Avengers expecting a lowbrow action movie, you are going to walk out of it in the first few minutes. Think of it more as an action sci-fi art-house film and you'll love it."

The CGI isn't great but is also the least of the problems. I can just imagine how disappointed you'd be in the cinema watching this. It's really got nothing interesting to offer, but is at least not painfully slow like a lot of bad movies.

I had the most flattering pre-viewing perspective going on, I swear. But I barely made it through that opening scene. It was too odd. I stuck it out (and I'm glad of that), but I can see how zillions others would not.\n\nI think the comments about the how badly the movie was casted was due to the opening scene wherein Ralph Fiennes as John Steed goes through his strange little agent evaluation. It was too much of a shock to this poor woman's system to see Fiennes doing the Jackie Chan thang. I don't think Fiennes can only play elegant, subdued characters (in Strange Days he didn't look so bizarre punching and being punched), but this whole scene was just lame at the gate. I can just see how an opening scene with even a little more subtlety (there could hardly have been less) would've paid-off handsomely.\n\nI was quickly engaged by Steed's and Peel's flirty dialog full of double entendre's and remembered why as a grade school girl, it was the only show that my father and I happily watched together. It also reminded me of those wacky English comedies from the 60's like What's New Pussycat ... just didn't remind me enough though. It was too middle of the road. Just not the right amount of outlandishness. When it WAS tossed-in, I found myself thinking, \"What the h*ll is that?\" (especially in the case of those Grateful Dead style teddy bears)\n\nI did love the sets and gadgets and Thurman's groovy clothes. Ralph Fiennes was very sexy as the reserved John Steed (Hello! that boot scene!). Uma Thurman also was really neat as the brainy sexpot (I love that look on her face when Connery makes that crack about being wet.) I think Fiennes' and Thurman's chemistry was successfully evident. Sean Connery, however, looked pretty much annoyed.\n\nThere just wasn't enough good stuff in the space of 90 minutes to outshine the bad stuff. It's too bad."

Fiennes and Thurman are all at sea, and even Connery, an actor who generally acquits himself well whatever the film, gives an embarrassing performance. The interplay and dialogue between Steed and Mrs Peel lacks any kind of subtlety, wit or charm and here is cruder - some of the exchanges feel like they belong in a Carry On film. As for continuity, it's virtually non-existent. Patrick Macnee's brief \"appearance\" as an invisible agent hidden in the bowels of the ministry building seems strangely appropriate - almost as if he couldn't bring himself to actually show his face. In short, it's a mess. While they're all still alive, why doesn't someone get Brian Clemens to write a \"reunion\" screenplay for Macnee, Honor Blackman, Diana Rigg, Linda Thorson and Joanna Lumley? I can see it now - they all meet up in Steed's nursing home (a home for retired agents), where someone's bumping off the residents...."

The male protagonist \"Raf\" Fiennes was less known, and doesn't suit the classic male-MACHO man that is bulky in muscles and filled with general animosity to other males and his antithesis (usually the 'EVIL' villain). He visits the elite club for men and pretends not to blush when his partner barges in. Both characters are highly stylized, elegant, and radical. It is possible to see that this is not a sensibility that Americans can understand or partake in.\n\nThis film is far removed from the normal spy-thriller.

The story was okay, but the dialogue was nowhere near up to the witty level of the series, and the direction was uneven, as were the special effects.

It isn't the best movie ever made, and certainly could have been better, but it deserves better than the trashing it got. If anyone had bothered to watch any of the television series they would have seen that it was frequently over the top and silly. The Avengers was always meant to be a spoof on the James Bond image, and in that this movie succeeds. The straight delivery of the ridiculous material is the point of the Avengers. It this I feel Fiennes and Connery did a wonderful job. Fiennes was perfectly unflappable all the way through, keeping a straight face at all the silliness, and Connery was delightfully over the top as deWinter. Thurman, unfortunately, was nothing but eye candy, not up to her usual standards and certainly not matching Diana Rigg. Yes, the teddy bears were silly, but, then, they were supposed to be. I bought this movie when it came out on video and will doubtless enjoy it many times 7/10"

This film does the TV show no credit at all.\n\nAs others have said, Fiennes acts like he has Steed's umbrella up his rear, and Thurman is unremarkable...astonishing. The scene with the Teddy Bear costumes is stupid, and the idea of the snow storm that almost kills Steed was laughably bad. For once, heed the critics and save your money...a definite ZERO!"

This time The Avengers took it seriously.\n\nWhile the film had so many reasons to hate it, the biggest fault was in the editing. One scene cut to another with no noticeable plot connections. Items were stressed for no apparent reason. Character movement was confusing. \"How did they get there?\", \"Why are they going here?\", \"How did she find that?\", \"How do they know that?\", etc.\n\nOn top of that, the chemistry was flat. One liners were delivered too deliberately, yet the meaning was to vague or juvenile. At times I wasn't aware that they were even delivering a line until the dramatic pause. I was waiting for the laugh-track.\n\nConnery's acting was third rate. I felt like he was just recruited from a high-school casting couch.\n\nRalph Fiennes, was so egocentric, that he seemed more of the bloated actor than John Steed.\n\nUp until now I didn't think it was possible for Uma Thurman to not look stunning on film.

        "review_detailed_main": "There is a certain irony in hiring Sean Connery to be the villain in this failed attempt at recreating for the big screen the cult TV classic \"The Avengers.\" Connery was, of course, the first and foremost James Bond. \"The Avengers\" was the anti-Bond; everything that was typical of the Bond films was cheerfully contradicted by the adventures of John Steed and Emma Peel. The Bond films were globe trotting affairs; \"The Avengers\" were stubbornly British. Bond, for all of his style, was something of a thug; John Steed was the epitome of English gentility. The so-called Bond girls were plentiful and colorfully oversexed; while Diana Rigg's Mrs. Peel rarely wore anything more revealing than a mini-skirt, but was brilliant, brave and funny, as well as being incredibly sexy. The Bond films were Playboy fantasies; \"The Avengers\" were progressively feminist friendly.\n\nAs such, the Bond films were mass market creations, always seeking to be bigger and gaudier and more explosive. The more modestly budgeted \"Avengers\" was just as incredibly far-fetched as far as plot and villains were concerned, but its tone was always self-amused and tongue in cheek. Though \"The Avengers\" had and has its loyal fans (me included), the series just couldn't compete with the world-wide phenomenon of the Bond films. This was especially true after Rigg left the series. \"The Avengers\" at its peak was a class act, but it never escaped the shadow of the Bond films.\n\nAlmost like rubbing salt in the wounds, the producers of the Bond films stole Honor Blackman away from \"The Avengers\" and made her a Bond babe in GOLDFINGER. Worse, Rigg became a Bond girl as well (and was killed off) in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, and Steed himself, Patrick Macnee, also ended up playing a supporting role (and was killed off) in A VIEW TO A KILL. It was almost like a conspiracy to destroy \"The Avengers\" little by little. Thus, when the idea arose to give \"The Avengers\" one last mega-push as a multi-million dollar, big screen adventure, it was both ironic and appropriately just to sign Connery to play exactly the sort of villain he confronted in his Bond heyday -- and to allow The Avengers to subdue him in kind.\n\nUnfortunately, the resulting film is less a vindication of \"The Avengers'\" superiority than a suicide pact. Instead of embracing the cheerful quirkiness that made \"The Avengers\" an enduring light, THE AVENGERS totally sells itself out in an effort to be a cheesy, clumsy carbon copy of James Bond. One gets the undeniable feeling that the makers of the film never actually saw a single episode of the TV series. For all of its outlandishly silliness, \"The Avengers\" was basically a warm-hearted satire of British eccentricity. The show used its dry, understated British sense of humor to mock that very same dry, understated British sense of humor. It was a little bit of Agatha Christie, a touch of James Bond and a gentle sprinkling of Monty Python, all played out at the intersection of Saville Row and Carnaby Street. The traditional and the trendy coexisting and mutually benefiting.\n\nTHE AVENGERS, the movie, is,...well, it's hard to figure out just what it is, especially since forty percent of its running time was hacked off between preview and premiere. The plot, as much as one can comprehend it, involves the standard industrialist-out-to-destroy-the-world plot. It has something of the chilly demeanor of Stanley Kubrick and the garish look of bad sci-fi. It's big and overbearing, but not impressive. Cold and lifeless, Ralph Fiennes brings absolutely no charm whatsoever to his interpretation of John Steed. Indeed, he was more likable as the death camp commander in SCHINDLER'S LIST. It would be hard to find anyone capable of matching Diana Rigg's crooked-smile mix of smug sexiness and blase brilliance, but Uma Thurman's confused performance is further sabotaged by her slutty attitude and creepy appearance. And finally, as if he were a suicide bomber, Connery gives what has to be the worst performance of his career. One could logically accuse him of purposely being awful in an apparent attempt to destroy the \"Avengers\" cult for once and always were it not for the obvious fact that the script and the direction are so bad, that it might not be all his fault.\n\nThe only shred of evidence that this has anything whatsoever to do with the great TV series, is a voice-only cameo by the real John Steed, Patrick Macnee. In a clever aside that has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of this ignorant mess, Macnee's tiny little guest shot neatly captures all the whimsy that made the TV show a perennial delight. It is too little and too late to save this film, but it is the sole reason the film should be seen.\n\nTHE AVENGERS is like WILD WILD WEST, LOST IN SPACE and MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE; they all take the name of and hope to capitalize on the built-in audience of great old cult TV shows, but they totally misunderstand their source material. The filmmakers never stop and ask \"Why was this show loved?\" They want the audience of the TV shows, but they don't actually want to be associated with the TV shows. Television is beneath them; motion pictures are where it's at. Making a bad big-budget movie has more cachet than making a superior episode of a great TV show."

It was simply magical. This gave me a similar feeling, but it's a very different film.\n\nFirst let me say that Uma Thurman was obviously cast for her body rather than her body of work. She looks great, but is totally flat in every way (well, erm, not *every* way). Ralph Fiennes is delightfully understated as John Steed, and Sean Connery is wonderfully over-the-top. The supporting cast is very strong across the board.\n\nThis movie lives and dies not with the acting, or the writing, or the direction, but with something that few film viewers really appreciate. The tone. The tone of this film is delightful silliness. Not one moment of this movie takes itself even a little bit seriously. I can only assume that people who object to the magnificently surreal teddy bear get-ups don't appreciate this fact. Sure, if Al Pacino had tried to rob a bank dressed as a big pink teddy in Dog Day Afternoon, it wouldn't work. But it works wonderfully in this film. In fact, it's absolutely perfect. And it's indicative of the fact that this film is not realistic. It's surreal, and fantastical, and a little whimsical.\n\nThe dialogue fits with this perfectly. The relentless repartee between Peel and Steed is wonderful (just imagine a competent actor delivering Peel's lines with an authentic sounding accent, and it will help). It's a bit of a stretch that Peel is better than Steed at *everything*, and takes the PC thing a bit too far, but this is a minor quibble, as Peel wins and Steed loses with such wonderful grace and aplomb that it's hard to mind. Besides, Steed holds his end up well enough, so it's ok.\n\nAnyway, you'll probably hate it if you're like most people, but I thought it was very enjoyable. I smiled through the whole thing. Fun fun fun."

In which case, he gets a B minus for effort, if not for imagination.\n\nIn attempting to conquer content with style, Chernik had two choices - originality or iconography. Unfortunately the TV series was able to take on both, Chernik opts only for icons. And they are all here - red phone boxes, E-type Jaguars, Mrs Peel's boots, English gardens, bullet proof pinstripe suits and a megalomaniac seeking world domination by means so peculiar they wouldn't make a James Bond script. Essentially we are left with sets that look wonderful and feel as though they belong in the Avengers universe. It is not here that the film fails.\n\nRalph Fiennes seems uncomfortable and plays Steed far too uptight. Surprisingly, Uma Thurman as Mrs Peel copes quite well with the English accent. However, neither actor is helped by a poor script with badly fleshed out characters and a weak plot.\n\nThe story, by the way, sees former secret agent superbrain Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery) forcing retail weather on the world governments. British agent John Steed recruits former weather boffin Dr Mrs Emma Peel to stop him. A few unexplained leaps of logic later our courageous two take turns at being captured, sparring with Sir August and battling various silent heavies. It is almost as if the film is missing twenty minutes and if you have seen the cinema trailer you will realise plenty of it did not make the final cut. Perhaps it should have.\n\nThe fault for this film being poor can be laid at the writer's feet, as the acting performances are as good as could be expected and the production design is actually first rate. The director should take some blame for failing to notice he had no story to work with.\n\nAs a summer blockbuster goes it meets all expectations, simply because we no longer expect them to be about anything."

If you ever want to inflict agonising pain on your enemies then sit them in a theatre with this movie and a revolver next to them.\n\nFirst of all, Uma Thurman does not fill out a catsuit half as well as the REAL Emma Peel, Diana Rigg, did.

In the television series, Patrick Macnee made him a dapper and thoroughly heterosexual English gentlemen. The only problem is that Fiennes plays him the same way 30 years later and, well, he's gay. And I do not just mean homosexual, this guy is as queer as a three dollar bill. To imagine any subtextual sexuality between him and \"Emma Peel\" (the real appeal of the television series) is ridiculous.\n\nWhen I first walked out of the movie theatre, I was like, wait a minute, there has to be like an hour of the film missing.

One of the hallmarks of the series was that no matter how strange it seemed at the start (and the beginnings were often strange), by the end everything would come together in the last five to ten minutes and it would all make perfect sense. Of course later I learned that there was indeed half an hour of the film missing and, well, even if those 30 minutes were the best 30 minutes ever put in a film, it still probably would stink.\n\nSkip this and watch the television series to see the real John Steed and Mrs. Emma Peel."

The fact that MacNee and Rigg got along famously on a personal level is readily apparent in the shows that they made together. With the help of astute writers and directors, they made it their own. In its day, it was charming.\n\nBoth Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman were badly miscast in what may prove to be their most ungrateful roles. They lack chemistry, charm, and charisma here. Their relationship simply never connects at all. Fiennes has a tendency to come off seeming cold and mannered in his other work. Unfortunately, that tendency is exaggerated here. Uma Thurman is ... well... unappealing (\"Emma Peel\" got her name for the British film industry expression \"M Appeal\" meaning \"man appeal\").\n\nThe miscasting (apparently this picture was a casting director's nightmare) pretty much sank the film's chances from the beginning. Generally, it looks rather handsome on DVD, but it simply manages to leave a bad taste.\n\nIn a more enlightened world, Pierce Brosnan might have made an adequate John Steed (a pity he will never be an adequate James Bond). Finding an Emma Peel to compliment the casting of John Steed was always the problem. Regrettably, that problem will never be solved for a second time."

The cats was good, with Ralph Fiennes from Schindler's List, Uma Thurman from Les Miserables, and Sean Connery. The costumes and sets were unique, with many details, the plot was a new concept (weather as a terrorist weapon), and interesting effects. Originally, the film was 2.5 hours or so but was edited down to about 1.5 instead. With that much cut down, it would probably mean that parts of the storyline were lost, and the characterization was toned down. The film also wasn't reviewed before hand in America, thus trashed here."

Diana Rigg was the heart of the old series, and Uma Thurman was a very poor replacement. I've never cared much for Uma anyway, and in this debacle she does little more than wander around and look moderately attractive. The villain, plot, style, and dialogue were all hopelessly lame, failing to even achieve any campy fun. It was truly painful to see Sean Connery acting so silly.\n\nAbout 2/3 of the way through this movie, I experienced something that has never happened in my presence before or since. All 15 or so people in the theater, spontaneously and unanimously, turned the movie into an episode of Mystery Science Theater-- loudly hurling insults and sarcastic comments at the screen. For that reason alone, I enjoyed the evening."

Not only is Macnee British to the core, he is also a guy you can hardly see in very serious roles or heavy drama. There is always a kind of sparkle in his eyes that made him the perfect cast for The Avengers. Fiennes is a great actor but completely without any natural comic appeal. Carrying a bowler hat and an umbrella is by far not enough to make a good Steed. The same applies to Thurman. Thurman had not enough sex appeal for Emma Peel and she is giving the part an edge that does not fit. It might have been a bad idea in the first place, to think someone can bring this perfect pair back to life. I'm trying to think who would have been a better cast. Colin Firth and Emma Thomson come to mind. So, without reflecting on the actual story, in my opinion this was bound to sink."

And seeing that Uma Thurman was also in the movie, I did believe that I was in for a good movie, one that I had just entirely forgotten about.\n\nHowever, the truth of the matter was quite something else entirely. It is hard to imagine what writers Sydney Newman and Don MacPherson were thinking when they sat down to pen out the script for this movie. It was a rather far out there and odd script and storyline, to say the least. And I found it very difficult to get submerged into the narrative and be swept along. I just found very little entertainment in the movie actually.\n\nThe movie actually has a rather impressive cast ensemble, with the likes of Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, Sean Connery, Patrick Macnee, Jim Broadbent, Fiona Shaw, Eddie Izzard and John Wood. The acting performances were good, despite the fact that the script and storyline was a swing and a miss.\n\nThis was a difficult movie to sit through, and it is definitely not a movie that I will be returning to again.\n\nMy rating of director Jeremiah S.

After all,it had a huge production and marketing budget(any thing from 65 to 70 million on the film with about another 50 million spent on advertising)a hot cast,stuningly offbeat visuals and judging by the trailer. Action packed. So how could this go wrong. By cutting large chunk's out of the film that's how.\n\nI wasn't a fan of the avengers when this came out, being fifteen at the time,i'd never really seen the t.v show.(i sitll have'nt mind you)But with it's british spy theme going on and the fact that it stared sean connery,led me to believe this was goner be like a bond movie. Having allways been a fan of the bond film's,i was intrigued, and planed on see it as soon as possable.\n\nBut on it's week of relese i read a lot of negitive thing's in the press. Critic's being banned from seeing it in the form of no press screening's,nearly thirty minites being cut because of poor test screening's,ralph fiennes and uma thurman having no on screen chemesty,none of the star's showing up for the premire. Anyway i finaly saw it on the second day of release,really wanting to enjoy this film because of the great trailer. But when the credit's started to roll and the lights came up, i realised that it was impossible to like this film. It was an utter travesty and to be frank,i felt quite p##sed off.\n\nIt was badly acted especally by fiennes and what sean connery was doing in it i will never know. Many of the cool looking bits that were in the trailer,never made it to the final cut,making the film run at a pidlling 85 minutes(inculding credits)and as a result making no sense what so ever. The only possitive thing one can say about this insult of a film is that it has great production design and good visual effects, but apart from that the avengers is a cinematic mess and one of the worst film's i've ever seen. A film not excitting enough to be an action film. A film not funny enough to be a comedy. And not serious enough to be any kind of drama. And it allso rather dull,which is probaly it's fatal flaw.\n\nI am glad it floped at the box office\n\n*/*****\n\nOne star out of five."

But she's not Emma Peel. Only Diana Rigg can claim that moniker.\n\nRalph Fiennes is a very talented actor, of great range and ability. But he's not John Steed. He phones this role in, and is painful to watch.\n\nThere are other, highly talented actors in this mess. Patrick MacNee, the original John Steed, plays an archivist named Invisible Jones, and has maybe five minutes screen time. Fiona Shaw and Jim Broadbent play the bosses of the Ministry, Father and Mother, in that order, and are wasted in the roles. Sean Connery has a blast chewing scenery as Sir August de Wynter, a lunatic who can control the weather and is out to blackmail the world for all the money he can get, as if he really needs it. And Eddie Izzard is his chief flunky, Bailey, who has very few lines and is wasted here. All of these actors have next to nothing to do, and their presence does nothing to redeem this horrid mess. The attempt at clever banter between Steed and Peel seems forced, and the feeble attempt to inject some small bit of romance between them is totally false. Fans of the original show, of which I'm one, will be hugely insulted by this perversion of the old series.\n\nBut, if you ignore the source material, it's almost worth seeing just for the set pieces and Uma's fine form in a skintight leather catsuit. However, if you've seen even one episode of the old series, you'll realize very quickly just how bad this abortion is. Find something better to watch than this. If you must watch The Avengers, switch channels over to BBC America; at least there you can see what Steed and Mrs.Peel are supposed to look like."

The reviews I had read prior to seeing this film did not adequately prepare me for the total waste of good talent on the screen. Sean Connery, Ralph Fienes and Uma Thurman, no small talents themselves, were put in roles written so poorly one would not have guessed that there was a successful television series to have inspired the characters.\n\nThe leads had none of the chemistry in the banter that was part of the charm of the old show. They spoke the lines, stiffly, and we didn't care. I kept waiting to get past the boring parts, but was never rewarded for the effort.\n\nPatrick MacNee probably had the best on screen role, that of the invisible man. One that at least saved him some of the embarrassment."

        "review_detailed_main": "Uma Thurman has the unenviable distinction of appearing in the 90s' two biggest \"can't be that bad, surely?\" films. Like \"Batman and Robin\", The Avengers, through sheer will of its poor critical reception, compels one to see it. An unseen force taunts the innocent rental video store customer with a \"come on, you know you want to, you're dying to know if it's as bad as they say\".\n\nOf course, the Avengers, like Batman and Robin, IS every inch as bad as they say. 86 minutes (the anaemic \"plot\" can't even stretch to an hour and a half) of sheer, unerring tedium that beggars belief. Thurman is the most obvious target. Her English accent is about 90% successful to my ears, (she's certainly no Keanu or Dick Van Dyke in the fake Brit stakes), but this notably draws on her acting. But the main flaw is her innate lack of irony. She just doesn't appear to comprehend such an old style of wit (not that such a misinterpretation is hard, as limply presented as it is here), and whereas in the delightful Pulp Fiction she amuses with her tales of Tony \"Rocky Horror\" and being the humour element of \"Fox Force Five\", as Mrs. Peel she's a washout.\n\nMany people cite the film's failure as a direct comparison to the television series. Whereas I understand enough of the show to know the real Mrs. Peel was too much of a lady to kick Eddie Izzard where it hurts, I've never really been acquainted with the 60s exploits of Patrick Macnee and co for it to really matter. To this end, I believe this gives me a fresh advantage in viewing the movie. I came to The Avengers without having to compare Fiennes' charm to that of Patrick's, or compare Thurman's curves to the incomparable cheekbones of Diana Rigg. It matters not. As good as the tv show, better, worse, the end result is the same: the movie stinks.\n\nNever on celluloid has there been such a resounding lack of chemistry between two leads. Even Thurman's scripted interruptions and witty rejoinders come too late, with Fiennes, sparkling in \"Strange Days\", excruciatingly self-conscious in Steed's shoes. Wilfully eccentric and forcefully quaint, their mannerisms are more poseur than debonair. These are two people that wouldn't even pass the time of day in real life, much less conduct a sexual relationship with chaste closed lips. Half the time it's almost impossible to believe they were in the same room during their scenes together, so weak is their connection.\n\nA slight upturn in the film is Sean Connery, who must have owed his agent a favour to have accepted this appallingly scripted farrago. As with his James Bond (to which the Bassey-soundalike Grace Jones end song owes a tip of the hat), Connery has an air of physical menace. And, as with the quote of this review, given half a chance Sean can make even the most innocent of lines sound dirty. He was actually talking about rain. Most of the time, though, he spouts about wanting a ransom in exchange for decent weather in England (like English people are so used to decent weather rain and snow would bother them - has the writer ever set foot in this country???) and tries to drug-rape Mrs. Peel in a distasteful scene. The rest of his lines are as inept as \"John Steed... what a horse's a**e of a name\", yet he manages to hold some modicum of dignity dressed as a giant teddy bear.\n\nIn all honesty I can see no way, no level on which this film works. Direction in terms of shots and angles is reasonable, but in terms of actors it's lousy. The script is trite and thin. I really can't bring myself to describe the storyline as a collection of set pieces, as the term \"set piece\" generally implies something good. Whereas even the execrable \"Batman and Robin\" had some good bits threaded together, none of the painfully set-up \"segments\" that make up this inanity carry any form of tension, drama or wit. Believe me, this film truly is as bad as they say. I saw this film so you don't have to. Thank me for it, hate me for it, reward me for it. Just do me a favour and don't bother to see it."

The direction was original and offbeat. The three main actors, Fiennes, Thurman and Connery all give worhtwhile (and very funny) performances in this very odd off-shoot of the classic 1960s TV series.\n\nSo we have to ask.. what were the critics expecting? Obviously a clear, linear, realistic plot. Well, we were never going to get this. A man in a 60's suit and bowler hat teamed up with a woman in a catwoman outfit, fighting a man who wanted to hold the world to ransom by directing the weather. No reality there.\n\nThere was never going to be reality.\n\nLike Batman before it, this is a cartoon-type movie. If you are prepared for the offbeat, then you will like this film.. soak up the subtleties, the very funny aside lines.\n\nIt's a spacey film... no action-a-second here.. but when it happens, it's great... sword & umbrella fights... thurman/fiennes; fiennes/connery; fiennes/badguys.. and of course those great sets, cars.\n\nThis is a spoof... a take off of the original series, James Bond films, even a touch of Star Trek. It's not as obvious as Spy Hard, but a much better trip. The cinematography will stay with you long after you've finished watching it.\n\nLeave your Hollywood expectations at home, and enjoy the ride."

(a bit out of the original order, but I can't help when I was born)\n\nAnd the Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes version is nothing if not true to those characters, the characterisations, and the story lines from those TV series.\n\nThose were every bit as far fetched, over the top, silly, bizarre, illogical, strange, weird and farcical as parts of this film version.\n\nExcept no-one appears to have watched this film version with the same affection as they would watch the original TV series(s).\n\nI like it, and I think if you approach it like you would a re-run of one of the earlier TV series, and divorce yourself from reality, put yourself into the idiom of The Avengers, then I think you can enjoy this film, too. Distance yourself from nostalgia,\n\nSince Sean Connery was also in this film - which brings the 1960s James Bond films to mind, think of this film more like the original Casino Royale (with David Niven as James Bond, and Woody Allen as Jimmy Bond) rather than the gritty modern Casino Royale with Daniel Craig.\n\nIt's not a 1998 film - it's just another episode in a weird 1960s TV series."

I used to watch the odd episode of The Avengers and enjoyed them, but I wouldn't say that I was fan or anything.\n\nThen came the fateful night when I was at a friends place. It was late, about 11pm when The Avengers came on. I had heard that a movie had come out but nothing more and didn't think too much of it. Two danger signs, late night movie and no critical acclaim where there should have been some. I just thought somewhat jokingly, 'how bad can it be?' It was . . . still is . . . awful.\n\nPeople can say that it was a farce of a movie, not meant to be taken seriously or that it was edited terribly. They can point out that Uma Thurman looks good in a cat suit or that one should or shouldn't compare it to the original series.\n\nNone of that helps me come to terms with what happened on that night! I started watching and the dialog puzzled me, then it got bad. I remember a nanny with a machine gun, a weird house that Uma couldn't get out and was for some inexplicable reason and then scientists dressed in colourful teddy bear costumes! That was the point when I said to myself, \"OMG! Well, at least it can't get any worse!\" But then it did! Every ten minutes or so this film plumbed new depths from the second Mrs Peel (for no explained reason) to a mysteriously empty London (again, no explanation was given).\n\nTo say that my decision to watch The Avengers that night was a bad one is like saying that drugs can make one feel a little strange! When I get a personal apology for this film by its makers I might then consider forgiving them. Until then \u0096 no deal! I gave it a 1 because I couldn't figure out a way to give it a 0."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Avengers was a British Institution during the 1960s. It returned again in the 1970s as The New Avengers, which was semi-successful. The series is very much based around characters who are nonchalant in the face of adversity. The chief character is John Steed, played by Patrick MacNee. In fact, one could say that The Avengers is John Steed played by Patrick MacNee.\n\nThere was a certain amount of silliness attached to the original TV series, which was its charm. The characters of John Steed, accompanied by Cathy Gayle (played by Honor Blackman) had started life in an all-but-forgotten series called \"Police Surgeon\". (Not the American series of the same name.) Honor Blackman's catsuit coupled with high-heeled Russian boots, became an icon of the sixties. (How many people know that Blackman and MacNee actually recorded a song called \"Kinky Boots\", which was released as a single?) The catsuit and boots were taken over by Diana Rigg as Emma Peel. Emma's husband is missing believed dead in some remote corner of the world. This allows a certain amount of harmless flirting between her and Steed. This contributes to the charm of the original series. In the series it is done by dialogue. In this film it is more physical, and is charmless.\n\nWe got a sniff of what the original series was about with the scene of all those teddy bears sitting around the conference table. Sadly when Sean Connery bumps two of them off, that kills the mystery, and the teddy bears are (apart from one scene soon afterwards) never seen again. In the TV series, those teddy bears would be a source of mystery and menace until the very last scene.\n\nThe \"problem\" that Steed and Peel have to solve is weather control. Now, how many films have featured that? Offhand I can think of Flash Gordon, Our Man Flint, and wasn't there a Matt Helm film that featured that, too? So we are talking about a plot that is unoriginal. At the end we get the booms and bangs and flooding that has become the norm for Hollywood thrillers in recent years, all filmed through the usual blue filter.\n\nActingwise, Sean Connery starts off well, as an eccentric in the style of the old TV series, but becomes a stereotyped villain as the film progresses. Uma Thurman I thought was surprisingly good, although the script did not allow her to develop her character much.\n\nBut The Avengers is not The Avengers without John Steed. Here Ralph Fiennes was an absolute disaster. The Steed character is built around Patrick MacNee. The MacNee Steed is phlegmatic, effortless, never raises his voice, is graceful in his movements. If the ground opened up beneath him, he would simply step over the chasm giving the impression that he didn't even notice it. MacNee also has the face of an older man, and that gives him an air of authority. Ralph Fiennes's face is too young. His voice is just not right. He wears an open necked shirt in one scene. (MacNee would have worn a cravat.) Fiennes just doesn't have MacNee's style and panache. In fight scenes Fiennes tries too hard. MacNee need only tap an enemy on the head with his Gamp umbrella and the enemy would flake out. No need for all that action and rough stuff. (Whatever happened to realism?) But Fiennes's biggest sin is that he does not know how to carry an umbrella, and he does not know how to wear a bowler hat. To be honest, Fiennes looked more like Freddie Parrot-Face Davies than John Steed."

From the trailer, it did seem to promise action and a bit of excitement, and thus I was rather eager to watch this movie.\n\nWell, after watching it, it might be fair to say that it was somewhat of a letdown. Firstly, the progression of the plot didn't flow quite well. After reading the many user comments, it seems that parts of the film have been cut out. No wonder it was quite confusing and difficult to follow what was going on. Also, the plot was quite stale and mundane, with a lack of twists. I had the impression that the director or writer took us all for little kids with minds so simple that the bad guys had to be pointed out right from the start. The script certainly does disservice to the cast of the movie. Also, I'm sure that British wit and humour is much funnier than it is made out to be in the movie. It was as if I knew that that particular line was meant to be funny, but somehow I found that I couldn't laugh at it at all. Pity.\n\nHowever, the special effects were quite good, and living in the tropics, I loved the snow scenes and those of London and the river Thames. On the whole, an ok movie which can be watched when shown on TV, but not exactly worth going to the cinemas to watch. I give it a 6.5/10."

Although I did not see the original TV series, based on this film, I would be interested in it. In addition, the viewer's ears were not assaulted by the constant stream of profanity found in too many of Hollywood's offerings.

        "review_detailed_main": "If you are a fan of the original Avengers tv series then you'll probably like this too. If you hated the weird, 60s hallucinogenic oddness of the programmes, then this is definitely not the film to watch!\n\nPersonally, I'm still not sure whether the film was seriously flawed, or just `bizarre yet strangely appealing'. I think on the whole though I'm heading towards the latter.\n\nFirst the actors: Uma Thurman (the only American) offered a more than passable English accent as Mrs Peel; however, it was at times just too laboured which gave rise to pacing problems. The rest of the cast are all much liked British actors (ok..Fiona Shaw is Irish) and therefore tended not to suffer so much from the required stylish presentation of their lines. And stylish the film is! This will either annoy, or delight you: as will the special effects which range from computerised blockbusting spectacles to superimposed cardboard cut-outs. Again, all in the spirit of the original programme.\n\nAnd speaking of special effects, I was intrigued with some of the location shots. Particularly the one of them driving down the Holborn underpass, which now appears to overlook the Thames to the Greenwich Naval College! If you've visited London, you'll know what I mean! (Someone's nicked the BBC!!!)\n\nThere are many, many one-liner jokes, not all of which may have been intentional! Maybe those of us with...risque...minds simply read too much into the slightly stilted script??\n\nOverall though, pacing is the big problem. I don't know whether this is because of bad scripting, bad direction or bad editing (the film is rather short: less than 90 minutes, perchance some things were left on the cutting -room floor??). However, if you can overlook this and take the film on its constituent parts rather than as a whole, then you're in for an entertaining hour and a half.\n\nFor me though, the biggest disappointment was the absence of the Laurie Johnson Avengers theme. Or rather, to be more accurate, you get the big opening chords, and then just when you're about to jig along to the boppy bit it went all quiet! Sad!\n\nI wanted to see the film because of its trailer, which is fabulous. However, said trailer does not give an accurate picture of what the film is like. Some people may go because it implies that the film is a stylised James Bond action movie. Be warned...it isn't!"

I saw a small similarity to this film and \"Austin Powers\", only \"The Avengers\" is more serious knowing how suave Emma Peele and John Steed are. Also, Sir August de Winter is no Dr. Evil, either.

        "review_detailed_main": "I've been a long running fan of the original series for a long time so when I heard Warner Bros were making it i was a bit concerned. I think i had every right to be. Instead of a subtle quintessential English theme it had turned into a bizarre version of the original. Mrs Peel and Steed as psychologically disturbed was a surprising idea but Fiennes & Thurman were not up to the job,taking the thing far too seriously. The moments with the teddybears was hilarious, and the double-entrendre by Connery that \"In Ghana you can get a good ten inches overnight.\" was played quite deadpan and I started to warm to it.\n\nThe rest of the cast was underused, Eddie Izzard said nothing and just screamed. Fiona Shaw wasn't given much to work with as Father but did quite well. Jim Broadbent was very good as mother. Eilen Atkins was hilarious as Alice - when an evil henchman of Connery's Sir August DeWinter flee's from her machine gun fire she emits with comic timing \"cheeky little b*****d \".\n\nApart from these little comic gems spread sparingly through the film. The plot was sparse and borrowed from some old avengers episodes. The repartee between Thurman and Fiennes was very stiled and seems as though tried to put over some 'dramatic' pauses or something, it didn't have the same feel as Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg had. The Laurie Johnson theme was give a little blast at the end when it should of been spruced up and been put on at the beginning instead of tame chords. The locations were good but the 80s Lloyds bank building in london was odd. The special effects were quite good on the whole, Eddie Izzard playing about with a squadron of CGI killer bees was the one of the most memorable alongside Big Ben exploding.\n\nOn the whole the feel of the original was there you just had to dig through the impaired script and the poor performance of Thurman and Fiennes. Not bad but it could of been alot better, you'll either love it or hate it."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am somewhat surprise at the vitriol shown by most of the reviewers. To me it isn't that bad. The major fault with it is the terrible miscast of Ralph Fiennes as John Steed. Ralph Fiennes looked ill at ease in this role, lacking completely the easy charm of the Patrick MacNee. While MacNee looked urbane, amused but also amusing, Ralph Fiennes just looked twitchy and uncomfortable in this film, and can't seem to smile without looking like he is suffering from piles.\n\nApart from that, the film is reasonably OK. Sean Connery is below par but it is good to see Eddie Izzard here. The film has the somewhat surreal, quirky and camp feel of the old TV series, and Uma Thurman has enough man appeal to play Emma Peel. It certainly could have been much better, but I was entertained all the same by the cheerful absurdity and eccentricity of the film like the TV series. Not bad really."

With reference to Steed being gay, he is not meant to be Rambo, more a Gentleman, i thought Ralph was excellent along with Mrs Peel. The wardrobe was great as well, some fantastic 60 outfits worn by Mrs Peel along with some fine Cheong Sams when in her cool London flat. I felt the actual story was great with some realy weird characters, like the original. Interesting to see Shaun Ryder (from Black Grape) as one of the zombie like hench men. I came out of this movie wearing a huge smile and felt that i had been totaly entertained as it seemed to be over so quickly. Overall a really good movie."

Uma Thurman proves once again that she is a good martial arts fighter. She's better in Avengers than she was in Paycheck.\n\nSean Connery plays the very silly eccentric role of Sir August de Wynter, totally out of character for him, so he must have done it just for fun. By the way, that year he was voted People magazine's \"sexiest man alive.\"\n\nI wouldn't be hard on Ralph Fiennes as John Steed. The opening scene is fun and he's a likable character: a reserved understated English gentleman who intends to tame the vivacious brilliant Mrs. Peel. Everything follows the morality of the typical 1960s sitcom. No blood."

All I can tell you is that I enjoyed Fiennes & Thurman as the film's crime-fighting duo (they have good, very-British chemistry, too), I enjoyed watching Connery ham it up as the villain, the script is quite funny in places, the surrealistic look of the film is faithful to the original series, the action scenes are fun, and the sound & special effects are truly amazing. All nicely put together in a tight 90-minute package. I was never bored by \"The Avengers,\" and the film left me wanting more. There SHOULD be a sequel, but thanks to all the negative press, as well as the disappointing box-office run, there probably won't be one. A damn shame, 'cos \"The Avengers\" is a lot of fun. Keep your heads up, Ralph, Uma, & Sean. You made a GOOD, FUN movie that I'm quite sure will get a whole new lease on life after it comes to home video. BE PROUD! :-)"

        "review_detailed_main": "When you begin to watch this movie, it is well worth considering the original 1960's TV series on which it is based. The eccentricities, humour, endearing English decorum and copious cups of tea are dominant themes throughout the main plot, which simply is an evil scientist trying to impose his despotic will on the world by controlling the weather. The scenes are beautifully shot, they are well structured and compliment the various characters as they are introduced. Ralph Fiennes is more than capable as Steed, as is Connery as Sir August, although I felt Connery lacked a little depth in some scenes perhaps due to the thinness of the script at these points, but I would have expected Connery's talents to have compensated. Uma Thurman was a great surprise for me. My reservations about her abilities to fill the role of Emma Peel soon disappeared. She was able to master an English accent as well as the poise and witty elegance of expression, giving all the charm and sassiness of Mrs. Peel with ease. Throughout there are some marvelous absurdities introduced into the plot, the 'Teddy Bears' being most notable. Again remember the original series. These are aspects that made the series highly entertaining. They are refreshing absurdities, pure escapism. All in all, well thought out, well shot, fun and a truly beautiful homage."

It felt like it was going everywhere and nowhere at the same time, and there are numerable problems with the plot consistency. This movie is okay if you're looking for a way to kill an hour and a half some dreary weekend, but I don't recommend it for any more than that. And, not having seen the original show, I can still say that the movie in no way lives up to the spirit of the original.\n\nit's not a thinker.

They do indeed \"save the world in style\". Given the somewhat comic -book-nature of the story, suspension of disbelief is easier to come by here than it is in some other films; clearly this is not set in our real world, but rather in a comic-book world with different possibilities and plausibilities.\n\nFiennes' Steed is quite the debonaire agent in a way that Bond could never be, and this is well-demonstrated by the openning sequence where he emerges from several tussles with his suit unscathed.\n\nPeel and Steed's chemistry works well, exemplified by the scene where they play chess (without looking at the board), further themselves on the path to romantic involvement, and analyze weather photographs--all simultaneously --without skipping a beat.\n\nIf you're expecting a regular Action or Adventure film, this isn't it, but if you're looking for a slightly off-beat comic Secret Agent Heros Battle Arch-Villains and Still Have Time For Tea -film, this one hits it dead -on."

As everyone knows \"The Avengers\" wasn't a success in the theaters, which is good, but at the same time very sad. Good because the audience (obviously) doesn't watch any movie that has a great budget, but bad because of that there are some great things about the movie. First of all, the script was funny, but since the film was cut down, there's not a lot left of it. The parts that were left, though, were adequate. The cinematography by Roger Pratt is beautiful and both the production design and the costume design was dazzling. The actors do a good job and deliver their one-liners with good timing. Sure, this movie isn't one of the best action-adventures that I've seen, but works out quite well on a sunday afternoon.

In fact, a copy of the print wasn't even in the UK 3 days before its release date. All this alone was enough to put a lot of the general public off it from the start.\n\nMe being one of the few who went to see it, wasn't very happy that a British Institution was turned into tat by silly American prejudices (tea anyone??) and a silly plot which could have been written on the back of a fag packet in a pub on a Friday night. Indeed, the scriptwriters must have been under the influence to give the highly talented Eddie Izzard a part as a mute. The performances from Fiennes and Thurman are also to be considered dodgy. Fiennes almost looks close to tears in places and the legendary Mr. Connery wouldn't look out of place in a pantomime. The whole charade is a perfect example of what can be made of a talented cast under the direction of Jerimeah Chechick (Sharon Stone in Diabolique.?).\n\nThe plus points are that the whole film looks really nice and some of the effects and set pieces are good, but the wafer thinness of it all soon dashes all hopes of your enjoyment of even this aspect of it all.\n\nAll in all the makers of this film made a total hash of what was a respectable British classic, but now just a laughing stock.\n\nWill Mr. Chechick ever work again..? Only time will tell.\n\nExtremely disappointing."

All in all, not a blockbuster, but a highly entertaining film, which made me smile (OK the teddy bears were a little silly !) The action and special effects were as good as you will find on more up to date movies. Fiennes, Thurman and Connery were all excellent, and the plot well thought out. A wonderfully British theme, of course, choosing the weather. I assume non-Brits will get the humour/self-parody."

The action wasn't invigorating but was fun and the fx weren 't great but not bad either. Each actor looked like they were having fun in their roles. Connery was a fun villain in the James Bond vain.

I am, however, going to trash Warners PR department for refusing to screen \"The Avengers\" to reviewers, thereby sending out a negative buzz worldwide and losing them around $10 million, I reckon, in box office receipts worldwide on the opening weekend.\n\nAnd the movie is good. Not great, but good. It is fast, glossy, stylish and funny, managing to keep the best aspects of the series while successfully updating it to '90s production values. Fiennes and Thurman are excellent as Steed and Peel, with great chemistry between them, while Connery makes an appropriately diabolical madman (although the Connery twinkle is ever-present). The supporting cast do a fine job too - watching Eddie Izzard keep his mouth shut for that long is a strange experience\n\nI am not familiar with much of Jeremiah Chechik's work but he makes a pretty good fist of the action sequences, particularly the car chase, and the weather special effects are superb. The script is filled with bizarre touches which mostly work well, although the dialogue takes a bit of getting used to. Problems? A couple - some of the dialogue in Steed and Peel's earlier scenes is rather stilted and overwrought, and goes on for too long. The whole film feels too short, as if it has been cut heavily, meaning that one or two scenes don't make much sense. But the whole film takes place in a kind of parallel reality anyway so this isn't as much of a problem as it might have been. Overall? It's great fun, and well worth seeing whether or not you're an Avengers fan. I had barely watched the series before, but I might start now..."

Why should promising shows such as these not be compared directly to a film with an over-acting Sean Connery, one of his funniest roles, or a brilliantly proper corp of secret agents.\n\nNo one should care whether giant mechanized bees or people dressed in psychedelic fur bear suits are believable because they aren't, they aren't supposed to be. Unlike James Bond, this movie does not pretend to live in the extraordinary ordinary, rather the extraordinary extraordinary.\n\nNext time a Jackie Chan movie comes out be sure to compare the over-acting and camp to the Avengers because they are more alike then people realize."

I mean that could never happen.... right?\n\nWrong. Enter The Avengers. This movie sold me immediately because I'm a sucker for Uma Thurman, though it did bother me a bit to think that throughout the movie she was preggo with some other man's child. How could she do this to me? I thought we had something special. \"Shut up Tal, and get to the mashed potatos.\" Okay, okay, don't yell. Going to this movie, I didn't know what to expect, I've seen the classic TV show, and first of all it's not such a classic. I haven't seen it anywhere in like forever. The truth is that is basically was supposed to be like another James Bond type thing.\n\nThe movie begins with Ralph Finnes (playing John Steed) and Uma Thurman (playing Emma Peel) being called on some top secret confidential code red really hush hush type meeting with this nicotine stained version of... of... well, some old fat guy in a wheelchair. So there's this chick impersonating Uma and killing people and doing all kinds of mean things, so, who do they suspect? hm. Uma.\n\nIn preparation, Uma dons her tights and prepares for battle. You never see her naked in the movie which is a negative quality about any movie whatever (I am a firm believer that any movie could be made better with a nude Uma Thurman, even grumpy old men could have used a bit of ThurmanBreast). John Steed is almost naked in this one scene, this should excite you ladies. Not. He's such a dork, whatever, not worth the time.\n\nSo Sean Connery is this scotsman Sir August de Wynter who wants to control the weather, and decides the best way to go about it would be to dress up as a carebear (I kid you not). So then all the bears run around shooting each other, Sean gets ****ed, calls up a mighty storm, the avengers step in, Uma kills her clone (I almost cried. Who in their right mind would kill a perfectly good Uma?), there's this great action seqeucne where Sean and Ralph fight for a bit. Ralph kindof wins (he is a sissy afterall), Sean loses and we learn that metereology should be left in the safe (albeit plump) hands of Al Roker.\n\nIf my commentary made no sense, neither will the movie, but it makes no sense consistantly, and makes no attempt to convince you that it is making sense and you're just missing it, kindof like when the carebears had a moral which didn't make any sense at the end of their show, like \"never paint your neighbors lawn green because it already is\" and then they'd cackle on insanely with glee as if they've just revealed one of the secrets of life, and we used to laugh along with them. Now, if you're like me and have waited for the bad bears to come out and play, this is your flick. Either way, it's a good way to pass the time and is a perfect makeout movie for you datebuffs because if you miss any chunk of the movie, it'll be just as if you missed nothing at all."
