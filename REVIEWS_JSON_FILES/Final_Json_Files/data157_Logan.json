        "review_detailed_main": "Gritty, honest and brutal. Just like a movie about Logan should be. This is by far the best X-Men film as far as I'm concerned. Logan doesn't hold back at all which I absolutely loved. For the most part, there is just an onslaught of awful things happening. And apart from the relationship between Laura and Logan, nothing makes you go 'oh, that was nice'.\n\nVery early on in the film, I got huge John Wick vibes. The action was very reminiscent of those films. It was fast, it was brutal and graphic, and it wasn't afraid to show everything. Indeed, you got the sense that Mangold was trying to find more and more interesting and gory ways to kill people. Something that the John Wick franchise also does. This comparison between John Wick and Logan is nothing but a positive one. If you ask me, the John Wick films are some of the best action films to have come out in recent years, as is Logan.\n\nWhere Logan really shines though, is not in the action, but in the story of Logan. It's a depiction Logan that I think a lot of people have wanted to see. Although I'm by no means an expert on the comic books, I have always had the feeling that Logan is a much more complex and difficult character than the previous X-Men or Wolverine films have led to believe. Logan is just as brutal with its depiction of the character as it is with its action.\n\nLogan really should be used a case study on how to do a comic book film. The only problem it faces is its R rating. I absolutely loved the rating as it allowed the film to go as dark as it needed and wanted to go. But comic book movies are, of course, supposed to be the highest-grossing films studios make, and an R rating will automatically lower revenues.\n\nIf you have been looking for a comic book film that isn't just like all the previous ones, Logan is the one for you. As mentioned, it is brutally honest and gritty, and the action is more brutal than you would ever dare to expect. It's a fantastic action film but it also manages to create such an impressive story that you will find yourself amazed with the depth of it. Is it my favourite comic book movie ever? No. But is it easily one of the best ones? Absolutely."

        "review_detailed_main": "The word 'perfect' is very objective especially when it comes to film. While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.\n\nThe film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well.\n\nThe performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.\n\nOverall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation."

        "review_detailed_main": "FILM: 8.5 Rewatching Logan, I can't help but feel a rush of emotions as Hugh Jackman says goodbye to the role of Wolverine... or so we all thought, including Hugh himself. James Mangold teams up with Jackman for their second outing focusing on Logan, and this time it's a decidedly more introspective event, wholly unlike any other X-Men film. Taking cues from his 3:10 to Yuma remake, Mangold turns this into a western of sorts with sci-fi embellishments, creating a unique and compelling atmosphere.\n\nJackman delivers his most nuanced performance as Logan, portraying a character who is older, wearier, and more vulnerable than we've ever seen. It's fascinating to watch him bring depth and raw emotion to the role, making it a fitting swan song for his iconic character. Patrick Stewart also gets plenty of scope to do something entirely different, and his portrayal of Professor Xavier is both heartbreaking and powerful.\n\nEven the plot points that usually come across as generic, such as certain action set pieces, have a different tone and feel in Logan. Mangold manages to infuse these scenes with a sense of realism and grit that makes them stand out from the typical superhero fare. The action is brutal and unflinching, but it never feels gratuitous. Instead, it serves to underscore the themes of mortality and redemption that run throughout the film.\n\nWhat I love most about Logan is how it successfully blends genres, taking elements of the western and the sci-fi thriller and melding them into a coherent and engaging narrative. The film's introspective nature allows for character development and emotional resonance that are often missing in superhero films. It's a fitting way to say farewell to the role of a lifetime... for now.\n\nOverall, Logan is a remarkable achievement, a film that transcends its genre to become something more profound and meaningful. For me, it's a deeply satisfying rewatch that reminds me why I love the character of Wolverine and the world he inhabits.\n\nFORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray\n\nVIDEO: 10.0 Native 2160/24p presentation Detail level: Excellent Colour reproduction: Excellent Level accuracy: Excellent Encode: Excellent Master condition: Excellent\n\nAUDIO: 10.0 Dolby Atmos audio Dialogue reproduction: Excellent Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent Dynamics: Excellent Surround sound presentation: Excellent LFE content: Excellent\n\nMOOFIEMETER: 9.0."

A young girl mutant enters their lives which sets off a story, which is not about super heroes fighting bad guys, but one that is on a more human level. \"Logan\", is a beautifully made X-Men film that deals with themes of importance of family, loyalty, and ultimately how Logan himself deals with new found emotions which he is experiencing for the very first time in his life.\n\nThis is the crowning achievement in Hugh Jackman's role as Wolverine. It is the movie he and director, James Mangold had always wanted to make. It is a dramatic work of art and for X-Men fans, has plenty of action and special FX which are a definite cut above anything that has been seen before in Wolverine/X-Men films.\n\nA MUST SEE FOR ANY FAN AND A GOOD ENOUGH FILM TO STAND ALONE FOR ANYONE!!"

It felt gritty, it felt real with a sense of dread and hopelessness you don't often see in this comic-book blockbuster adaptations. It should be praised for doing things differently and really pushing the edge with what can or can't be done in the genre. The triangle between Logan, Charles and Laura works as the driving force of the plot, and is very well developed. Logan's character arch is quite pleasant to watch, though obviously predictable. With that said, the acting is clearly masterclass. You can feel the dilemmas, the emotions and feelings that the characters are put through, specially those three. And another thing it does really well is alluding to a previous event - the Charles incident - but never fully explaining it to the audience, leaving you wondering. The action is nothing like you'd expect from a tenthpole - the R rating really makes up for wonders - being quite visceral and impactful. \"Logan\" probably deserved a better villain, although one could argue that the real villain here is not the typical multinational corporation, but the inner demons of the characters. Demons that prevent them from living albeit normal and somewhat stable life."

The man has taken the character and made it is own as the likes of Robert Englund did with Freddy and for this reason I hope we don't see Wolverine again as a recast would be a travesty.\n\nDue to the high rating, rumours of the film & Jackman claiming this was his last film as Wolverine I went in with very high expectations and truth be told they simply weren't met.\n\nDon't get me wrong Logan is a good movie, Jackman is great, Keen is surprisingly competent and the movie flows nicely but it all felt very familiar and rather anti-climatic.\n\nWolverine has become of the most iconic movie characters of the last few decades so if this was destined to be his last film we truly needed something special and I don't believe this comes under that category.\n\nEven with fantastic actors like Patrick Stewart, Richard E Grant & Stephen Merchant the movie never came close to reaching its potential and left me more than slightly let down.\n\nThe ending, arguably the worst part of the film. No spoilers to be found here just wads of disappointment.\n\nAfter 9 films as Wolverine I salute Hugh Jackman for literally becoming a character, all the respect in the world.

        "review_detailed_main": "SPOILER: Did we need another X-Men movie? In fact did we need another Wolverine movie? Well the result is there for all to see, with Logan not only showing itself to be undoubtedly the best Wolverine venture by far, but arguably the best X-Men picture as well. If, as expected (and surely to god it's hoped so), this is the last we see of the grumpy metal clawed superhero, then what a fitting and triumphant bow out it is.\n\nJames Mangold, the director, has managed to create an adult superhero movie without it really being a superhero pic, for he has created a film noir Western that happens to be about a superhero. Mangold's love of noir and Westerns bursts from the screen, which for those who follow those wonderful stands of cinema, will come as no surprise having seen with notice his Copland and 3:10 To Yuma redux. There's a perpetual grimness to the narrative that belies the quite often stunning surrounding locales, heavy themes such as men out of time - with destinies written (cue a deft comic book movie within a comic book chunk of metaphysics) - surrogates, mental illness, human ignorance, and on it goes, the narrative strong on intelligence as much as it is in wrought emotion. Western fans will also be buoyed by the part that the 1953 classic Western Shane has to play in things, considerably so as its importance narratively, orally and visually is mightily strong.\n\nLogan's Run!\n\nAh yes, well being \"adult\" is all well and good, but is Logan thrilling? Do we get pumped up Wolverine action, blood brains, splatter and mucho muscle flexing and pained roars of anger? Oh yes! Action from the off is never far away, and wonderfully staged and choreographed it is. Lots of memorable set-pieces, while also some cleverly constructed sequences such as Xavier's mind seizures hold court and enthral. Yet the kicker with all that is we are clued in to the emotional baggage that the side-burn sporting protag carries with him. With each fight we sense the bigger picture, even as we watch in awe the emergence of Laura (ironic film noir name right there as it happens) - and her part in this very \"human\" story - the thrills and spills are propelled by a meaningful but battered heart.\n\nTech credits are superb. Acting honours go to Jackman, who after giving 17 years of his life to the character, gives it his all and this multi faceted performance, in a perfect world, deserves Oscar recognition. Patrick Stewart, also, is immense, playing the nonagenarian Charles Xavier with such class, gracefulness and storming emotion that one can only admire. Film debutante Dafne Keen as Laura is utterly engrossing, quite a debut indeed, whilst Stephen Merchant as albino mutant tracker Caliban is effective to the point we hanker for more. Although the villains fronted by Boyd Holbrook (rote henchman leader) and Richard E. Grant (smarmy scientist git) just about pass muster, there's nothing to damage the piece. Cinematography (John Mathieson) is \"A\" grade, the filters set on neo-noir, with the splendid film noir black and white version a fillip for the heart of noir lovers. All that is left is for the sound mix to boom and the director to steer with heart, brain and soul, without doubt both come up trumps.\n\nOne of 2017s best films, a genre splicer that ticks all the boxes of great film making. 10/10"

Director James Mangold chose to make the film almost colorless with much, much more character development than previous Wolverine and X-Men movies. We see a tired character that no longer belongs in a world that has feared him for over a century.\n\nWhile Hugh Jackman in his last outing as Logan does an amazing job and proves once and for all why NO ONE ELSE can ever be Wolverine, the supporting cast does a superb job as well starting with Sir Patrick Stuart who returns as Charles Xavier, Boyd Holbrook (Netflix's NARCOS) as an astounding and dangerous antagonist and newcomer Dafne Keen who is a rather sweet but incredibly deadly Weapon X-23.\n\nThe movie is filled with gore and violence, but it does not feel forced at all in such an obscure movie. There is a rather new trend in Comic Book Movies after DEADPOOL, make them as brutal as possible, and while this started in the 90s with THE CROW and BLADE it has gained some track and more R Rated CBM are being developed as we speak.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend it."

        "review_detailed_main": "The final outing of Wolverine by Hugh Jackman is one unforgettable ride and one of the best comic-book movies in recent memory. Directed by James Mangold-who was also at the helm of \"The Wolverine\" (2013)- Logan creates a character-driven, violent and emotional film, which benefits from its rated-r rating. The acting, action and story of Logan are one-of-a-kinds in the superhero genre, as the cast, headed by Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and newly- introduced Dafne Keen, play their characters to the fullest. It is unlike any other X-Men film, definitely the best in the series and deserves the praise it's getting.\n\nWhen I saw the first trailer drop, headlined by Johnny Cash's \"Hurt\", I instantly knew we would be getting something different from everything else that has dropped since the first X-Men film in 2000. The brutality and intensity of the characters pay off in this almost two-and-a- half hour that redefines the superhero genre, and I hope pays dividends for future movies to come.\n\nThe introduction of X-23 was a big win as well. She is played by Dafne Keen, and though doesn't say much, plays her role very well. Her connection with both Hugh and Patrick creates a family-orientated environment that makes the movie a whole lot better, especially seen in certain scenes.\n\nLastly, as much as I want the character of Wolverine to continue being played on the big screen, it would be better for everyone if they didn't re-cast the role, as no-one would be able to play the role much like the legendary Hugh Jackman.\n\nOverall, Mangold and the cast, create a masterfully orchestrated film that will be remembered for years to come. Not only is it a great film, but it is the last time we will be able to appreciate and witness Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart in the X-Men universe."

        "review_detailed_main": "Without question, this was Hugh Jackman's movie, from start to finish. No matter how you view it, or who the mantle is passed onto next, Jackman will forever be Wolverine, and this film proves it once and for all. Logan dives deep into the hearts of its viewers, twisting and turning until every emotional string is pulled, and in the end, delivers a superhero film like no other before it; a perfect swan song.\n\nLogan heavily, and fittingly, borrows from Marvel's iconic 'Old Man Logan' comic to tell the story of a grim and desolate future, where mutant-kind is all but extinct. Director/writer James Mangold was finally given all the tools necessary to tell a truly compelling Wolverine story, and arguably the biggest tool in the box was the 'R' rating. It pushes the film into an extremely dark and forbidding tone, which helps carve the movie into one of immense intensity and emotion. The 'R' rating, of course, also allows for studious amounts of gore and profanity, but those elements don't feel like they were added just because they could be, they only added to the atmosphere Mangold created for this film, and in turn helps set the narrative to be nothing short of enthralling. The pacing is spot on, the dialogue is stellar and the emotional weight is that of a moving mountain. I applaud Mangold for his brilliant writing, and subsequent directing, as he was at last able to produce the Wolverine story every fan has been craving for the last 17 years, one of raw emotion, brutality and pure magnificence.\n\nHugh Jackman has devoted the last 17 years of his career to this beloved character, and now, he leaves it all on the table, giving the performance of a lifetime, one which could seriously garner some looks at an Oscar nomination. The writing of the characters, Wolverine specifically, stand out the most in the gritty setting, because few superhero movies have ever done what Logan is able to do; make the characters vulnerable, make them real and to make you truly care like never before. Wolverine is worn down and beaten, looking for a way out, and Hugh Jackman gives you every reason to want to feel for his character. His action scenes are nothing short of powerful, none more than his final, and the emotion he displays in every aspect is worthy of an award-winning performance. I genuinely cannot express my praise for Jackman enough, he gave it is all.\n\nWolverine is accompanied by two spectacular supporting characters for most of the film in franchise favorite Professor X and the ferocious X-23. Both characters add tremendous layers of depth to both Wolverine and the film as a whole, with exceptional performances from Patrick Stewart and youngster Dafne Keen, who's X- 23 is an absolute showstopper. The main villain, Pierce, isn't anything too special, but doesn't have to be in a story like this. The core cast of Wolvie, Professor X and X-23 are what drive the film and the performances by their respective actors are outstanding. The father figure that Professor X is to Wolverine and the subsequent father that Wolverine is to X-23 is a deep, touching addition to their characters. This is no-doubt a character driven film, and with Wolverine in the driver's seat, and a pair of dynamite supporting characters, the ability to connect with these characters is real, and that is a treasure few superhero films have ever held.\n\nThe film's action is gloriously vicious, showcasing what a hacking from Wolverine or X-23 would actually look like. But it's not just the heavy amounts of gore that make the action so amazing, it's again the feeling that these characters are in true danger and every move they make could cost them their lives, none more than Wolverine himself, whose reduced healing factor forces him into a different mindset that, outside of briefly in \"The Wolverine\", we've never seen before. He's not invincible, and even with X-23's relentless attacks, he still has to play his cards differently, and it translates into an emotional roller coaster. All together the action sequences and sheer amount of violence were a sight to behold, entertaining and fierce.\n\n17 years it has been, since we first watched a young Hugh Jackman don his X-Men suit. 17 years of stories, character development, action, hardship, humor and emotion, come together to deliver one final journey. The final scene alone may move you to tears, as Hugh Jackman's time as the iconic Wolverine comes to an end. One final epic masterpiece of superhero cinema; Logan.\n\n10/10"

His time has come . One last time .\n\nGood entry in \"Wolverine saga\" about the invincible bestial Superhero , ex-X Men, in which he becomes involved into a twisted intrigue full of noisy action , thrills , chills and spectacular as well as very violent scenes . The picture has overwhelming battles , impressive and breathtaking fights made by means of computer generador and some stunts . Special effects by Weta Digital are excellent and fantastic, but they don't overshadow the interesting tale. The story results to be more complex and thoughtful to follow , adding extreme violence but also sensitive scenes with an almost father , Professor Xavier , who is really elderly , unabled and wheelchair bound , besides an allegedly daughter with similar bloody skills to Wolverine . The script delivers surprises enough , adding a well-executed , unexpected and exciting ending , while the threads were leaving in previous entries remain compellingly tied . Based on Mark Millar , Steven McNiven comic Books : Old Man Logan and characters created by John Romita , Len Wein, and Roy Thomas with thoughtful and though-provoking story and script from Scott Frank , Michael Green, and James Mangold himself . The film packs impressive combat scenes , a lot of fights , violently staged with plenty of leaps , beheading , slashing , blood and gore.\n\nIt displays a moving and rousing musical score by usual Marco Beltrani . As well as colorful and brilliant cinematography by John Mathieson . The motion picture was competently directed by James Mangold. According to James Mangold who also directed Wolverine 2013 explained : \"I wanted to tell the story without the burden of handing it off a film that already exists and having to conform to it , for me that is such an interesting part of Logan's that it is nearly impossible to explore in a sequel\" . Writer and filmmaker James Mangold is a fine American movie and television director who has made good pictures .

The movie so adult in its approach that I think even youngsters who read the comics will learn to grow into. The script, the action, the acting is all great and goes to show that you don't need over the top action and effects to tell a great story. This movie gave me what I wanted...a movie. Something you can watch, be taken away and talk about hours after you watch it. And you don't have to know anything about the mythology of the Xmen to enjoy this film.This movie has heart and is directed wonderfully by James Mangold. Hugh Jackman's final performance as Wolverine is his best performance to date because of the range of emotions he has to go through in this film. Great film, highly recommended."

He must have liked this a lot if he agreed to watch it again with me as a first-time viewer. Indeed, this was quite different from many previous Hugh Jackman/Wolverine movies as it's a bit more intense and a little more explicit in language as well. This time, it's a future timeline in which he has to take care of a somewhat sick Charles Xavier (once again, Patrick Stewart) in some desert town while he works as a limo driver. Then a woman asks for his help which he at first refuses before a mysterious little girl appears. I'll stop there and just say this was quite a dramatically compelling narrative with plenty of exciting fight scenes along the way. So on that note, me and my friend highly recommend Logan."

A 10/10 should only be reserved for a film that is flawless in every way -- whether it be acting, directing, cinematography, story and everything in-between. For it to be perfect, the story has to be gripping throughout the 140 minute run time, and that's where I felt it was weakest. It's serviceable, but it isn't perfect. I have a feeling that the people who are giving this film perfect scores are doing so because its much grittier than any X-Men movie in the past. It's definitely savage with the violence, which was refreshing to me and I appreciated them going all-out with the hard R rating. It starts out freaking great when it's setting up the overall plot, but then it REALLLLY drags along for the 90+ minutes in the middle. During the second act, the story spent so much time focusing on little moments with minimal significance to the overall arc, that I found myself feeling really underwhelmed when the big emotional moments finally happened. Don't expect to be heavily invested in the villains either... they're given very little development on screen, and as soon as any meaningful dialogue starts happening to give the audience some exposition into what's been going on for the last 20+ years in this universe, it comes to an abrupt stop. If you're looking for action, you will be happy with the beginning and the end. Other than that, it's nothing more than a mediocre country western style \"road movie\" about Logan and the girl. I also left with more questions than I had going into it, which I'm assuming will be told through a new series of prequels. Overall, it was a so-so experience that wouldn't be getting such high scores if it weren't for the fact that it's an R-rated X-Men movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hugh Jackman was made for the role of Wolverine, even though he is a tremendous actor in his own right. However this swan song was one of the weakest X-Men film and it suffered from numerous obvious plot holes that made the audience go \"what?\" At the end of the movie, someone in the audience yelled out \"that ending sucked!!!\" and the entire audience laughed heartily - because most did feel that this was a mediocre tearjerker that wasted some great performances and superb CGI.\n\nI won't give away too much in this review, just enough for you to set expectations. It sucks when characters do stupid things which you know occur solely to continue the plot. For example, if you know someone is coming after you to kill you and it will be worse then next go round, you don't just let them hang around as if you're just a little careless - especially after a bloodbath. And it happens too often.\n\nWhat was truly terrible about the ending, without giving it away, was that it seemed as though the writers were trying too hard to figure out how to work in the ensemble shot reminiscent of a stage play that Hollywood cannot seem to stop itself from doing. It's phony and ludicrous. And I won't even describe the action, which basically happens throughout the movie. Characters will \"forget\" their abilities to do something smart or dangerous because if they do what you expect, it will ruin the scene from going where the directors want it to go.\n\nThe other aspect I didn't like about this movie was that Logan's character doesn't really get developed at all. It is manipulated and you'll appreciate what I'm saying when you finally get there. Please... we're all pretty smart. Don't insult our intelligence with yet another breathtaking spectacular moment where you can feel the director just praising himself endlessly for creating an emotional moment that is right up there on par with, oh... the climax of Saving Private Ryan. After taking forever to get to the ending, they rush right through it, as if they blew too much of the budget drawing out the first 2 hours and 10 minutes.\n\nIt's all watchable although completely unnecessary and milked for one last haul of cash. The young girl is very good but they seem to have kept the mystique for absolutely no reason whatsoever but to... well... make it super mysterious. It's OK but don't expect anything near the 8.4 on the IMDb ratings. This is another X-Men B-Movie, not really worth multiple viewings but something you might catch on cable. Farewell to two of the great actors who graced the screen with some great moments in cinematic history."

        "review_detailed_main": "Superhero films typically have to go down one of two avenues: colourful and humorous (e.g. Avengers, GotG) or more realistic and tough (e.g. The Dark Knight, Watchmen). Logan opts for the latter, producing a film worthy of Hugh Jackman, an actor typically starved of decent screen roles when playing Wolverine. Previous instalments in the Wolverine franchise have been average to poor, making Logan an important film for multiple reasons (especially given X-Men's loss of ground to the rest of the Marvel universe). By stepping away from the rest of the Marvel universe, the story doesn't become saturated with other characters crowbarred into the plot, giving Wolverine what he deserves.\n\nTo merge these two themes of darkness and lightheartedness is near-impossible, as pandering to child and adult audiences is more than difficult. Logan does as good a job as can be expected, using humour sparsely without ruining emotional moments that make up the core of the film. Jackman is unshakeable in his titular role, bringing the same intensity he has to the Wolverine role he had for the previous 16 years; this film allowed him to flex his acting muscles slightly more freely, not constrained by superhero films' typically wooden scripts. Patrick Stewart is also excellent as Professor X, reduced to an ambling shell of what he used to be, but ultimately Logan's only friend.\n\nThe storyline of Logan isn't a world-beater (Wolverine seems to suffer from a lack of decent plots), but for someone who has stuck with the franchise for its duration, it will surely satisfy any hardcore fans. As a standalone, Logan holds itself in higher regard than almost any other superhero film, delivering emotional punches successfully without cheapening scenes using ill-timed humour."

Everything else around are to spice up this very linear moments in the life of decaying wolverine.\n\nIf you are thinking this is a movie that you will remember after even like a week and miss, then you are wrong. This movie is worth watching one time, just one time. But is it necessary movie that I will say you should watch this before you die kind of movie? Not at all. You can miss out on this one and you will miss nothing important in life.\n\nI give it rating of 6 because I have seem better and more deep movies which kept me thing hours after watching the movie rated less than 7. So 6 is a good rating for this movie. Now why is it rated 8 or more? I have no clue how IMDb works who comes and reviews these movies, it got a 8 because I suppose it is Wolverine.\n\nWolverine is a character already developed, new characters in the movie had no emotional influence on me at all including the girl. If I think deeply about that I will rate it less than 6 but I am just gonna be generous and keep my 6 rating.\n\nThank you."

James Mangold wrote and directed it, but I wish he had put down the pen. Each scene is thoughtfully shot, but it's the story within those shots that left me wanting. The positives for me, beyond the ambiance, were two standout performances by under the radar actors. Stephen Merchant, who is usually in English sitcoms, went way off type with his character. Given his past roles I thought it was an odd casting choice at best, but now I couldn't picture anyone else doing what he did. The other was Boyd Holbrook, who played the main antagonist. The subtle choices he made in line delivery and how he carried himself made him a magnetic presence on screen. The film was much more engaging while they were involved in a scene. And then there are the negatives...As I alluded to earlier, the story was just not there. There's weak motivation throughout for both Wolverine and the villains. The movie creates its own plot holes unnecessarily and leans on tropes and off screen happenings to propel it along. The action scenes are an exercise in redundancy. Slash this guy, stab that guy, try stabbing and slashing this person, now mix it up a bit and slash THEN stab this guy. Once you see the first fight you'll have seen them all. And finally there are the inconsistencies with the special effects. They could create extremely detailed battle damage, but couldn't remove the prominent scar on the forehead of the self- healing girl. They could green screen prosthetic arms for multiple characters, but couldn't remove the reflection of the camera in peoples' sunglasses. These, and other details, while minor, added up quickly. Suffice it to say, this western did anything but ride off into the sunset. 4.5/10."

Throwing words like \"masterpiece\" is really pushing it. Makes you wonder if these people watch anything other than capesh1t.\n\nA year earlier, a Mel Gibson movie called Blood Father came out with a very similar story, minus the mutants. Now, the accusation of outright plagiarism is unfounded, but Logan, let's say \"borrows\" heavily from it.\n\nThe movie's central theme is a half-baked allegory for growing old and dying, sprinkled with CGI blood. In order to expand on this allegory, the best thing the filmmakers could come up with is for Logan to fight a younger clone of himself. The intent is obvious, but the result is underwhelming and anticlimactic. An honourable if failed attempt to add some depth to a movie about a guy who has retractable claws in his knuckles and who can heal himself almost instantly.\n\nThe primary antagonist Donald Pierce, played by Boyd Holbrook is the weakest part of the movie, he doesn't have enough screen presence and his performance is forgettable. The director probably didn't want anyone to overshadow Jackman, but a more memorable villain would've added instead of detracted from the storyline.\n\nThe last hurrah for Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, until Marvel Studios decides they want him to reprise the role."

An aging Logan on the verge of drinking himself into a coma has to deal with protecting the last surviving mutants including a dementia ridden Professor X from an organization hell bent on wiping them out once and for all. Along the way he meets up with his clone kin and has to face a younger version of himself that's superior to him in every way while staring down the barrel of his own fading immortality. Logan is a tried and true testament and love letter to the character that manages to give the fans one 'last' ride with the iconic hero that makes him go out with a Wolverine adamantium berserker barrage raging howl and it ends up creating a film with the only version of this character being displayed that you'll ever need thanks to it's hard R rating and expertly crafted screenplay."

Logan lives in an abandoned plant with the mutant Caliban (Stephen Merchant), who was a tracker, and they take care of the senile Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who does not have control of his telepathic ability and needs to use drugs to stay calm. One day, Logan is attending a funeral and a woman called Gabriela (Elizabeth Rodriguez) call him Wolverine but he does not give attention to her. Soon the bounty hunter Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) meets Logan and asks to help him to find an eleven year-old girl called Laura (Dafne Keen) that is with Gabriela. Logan is contacted again by Gabriela and she asks Logan to drive Laura and her to a place called Eden in North Dakota and she offers to pay for his service. The reluctant Logan accepts the job but Gabriela is murdered. He returns to the place where he lives and finds Laura there with Professor Xavier and Caliban. However Pierce returns with a group and Laura uses abilities similar to Logan to escape with Professor Xavier and Logan, but Caliban is captured by Pierce and his men. While heading to Eden. Logan discovers that Gabriela was a nurse in the Transigen Corporation taking care of children developed with abilities by Dr. Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant). When the Transigen decided to shut down the program and kill the children, Gabriela and the other nurses released them and now Laura intends to join her friends. Will they find the sanctuary?\n\n\"Logan\" is the swan song of Wolverine and Professor Charles Xavier in a dismal, violent and sad film. The plot is totally different from the genre with a dark story and unpleasant hero. The road trip showing two former superheroes protecting a girl with abilities is not original, but the cruel fate of the family that welcomes them in their home is. In the end, \"Logan\" is a well-made film too somber for a comic book adaptation. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Logan\""

I'm not a huge fan of the X-Men series of films, but this feels like the 'true' version of Wolverine. He's not a superhero, he's just a man who begrudgingly tries to find redemption by helping a young girl find sanctuary.\n\nI love the tone of the movie, the cinematography is outstanding, the characters are beautifully written and outstandingly portrayed. The action scenes are phenomenal, although the movie is not dependent on them one bit like other superhero films. The film even managed to give Stephen Merchant a believable, bad-ass action line!\n\n8.9 - Everyone should watch this film, superhero and non-superhero fans alike!"

From the emotional relationship to the plot and character of wolverine this film had my interest most of the time.

        "review_detailed_main": "45 minutes of this movie elapsed before there was any significant attempt at a plot other than the fact that Logan and Xavier were very down and out. During that 45 minutes there was extensive gore and violence including several cases of men stabbed in the head by Logan's claws. There was one scene where the child, Laura, rolls a decapitated head which presumably was a result of her own fighting. I think Logan said either the F word or S word more frequently than any coherent sentence. Since there was no chance this movie would not be R rated, there was also a short flash of women's breasts just so the movie could be labeled as having nudity. (There are cases where producers actually find this advantageous.) Logan repeatedly uses either drugs or alcohol.\n\nThe movie improves from there. We get some plot to explain where the movie should go next and why. The goal is to try to get Laura to Eden.\n\nAll the violence and vulgar language continues through the rest of the movie, including at least one blood-spurting decapitation. It also includes the unnecessary killing of a mother and her teen son and then later torture of \"mutant\" children. Even the \"mutant\" children commit extreme acts of gore. I cannot overemphasize how much gore and violence there was.\n\nWe do learn more about Laura's origins and there are several other significant events that occur that are extremely relevant in the ongoing X-Men story.\n\nIn the ratings, I see a very high percentages of 10 votes, 9 votes and 8 votes. I have to assume that the people gave those votes did so because of the significance of events that take place in the story and their enjoyment level. This is no where near an all-time classic movie. I don't even rate it among the best of the X-Men saga.\n\nThe villains were all clich\u00e9 and overplayed. Hugh Jackman did nothing in the way of credible acting. I don't know if Patrick Stewart was acting like he was feeble or if he is just actually getting old, but even so, not his best performance. For much of the movie Dafne Keen did not speak and tried to look fierce and vicious a lot, which is a little hard for the size of girl she is. Later, she showed some promise, especially with events at the end. Basically, IF there was any acting in this moving, it was done by the children.\n\nI still give this a generous rating of 6. This is because after the first 45 minutes the plot became much more interesting."

In this sense, the film should not be considered a traditional superhero story, but instead a violent drama. There is much more of an emphasis on character development and dialogue as opposed to special effects and cheesy one-liners, as we see how the physical and emotional wear-and-tear that Logan has experienced over the years has finally taken its toll on him.\n\nIn addition to Jackman and Keen, we get to see strong performances from Patrick Stewart reprising his role as the venerable Professor Charles Xavier and Boyd Holbrook as the bounty hunter Pierce. This core cast is enough of a foundation on which to build the rest of the film, and is a better way to create a more meaningful film compared with stretching screen time too thin in previous 'X-Men' offerings.\n\nThere are also a few themes that are explored through 'Logan,' including perseverance, sacrifice and faith, which elevates the impact that the film has on audiences. Through all of these, it's really the metamorphosis that Logan undergoes as an individual based on the challenges he confronts that really puts an accent mark on the film.\n\nWhile it's bittersweet to see this franchise likely end, 'Logan' is a worthy, respectable finale that does enough to satisfy fans."

That especially goes for all of the X-Men movies, I just feel pain because of their obvious stupidity. That's when Logan comes into the place. There is no life ending threat to humanity, there are just Logan and those he loves. I liked how the villain can't be called a proper villain, who is just a younger version of Logan himself. The characters are not hilariously powerful, Logan is old and irritated and his actions are lot less destructive than before. And his greatest villain is himself. No superhero movie felt so personal, so intimate to me before. The ending is not the end of the world, but Logan dying with his own heart in his hands. You can't even call it a superhero movie, it is a whole another level."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have to wonder how people will react to Logan even a year from now, much less years from now, when some of the story flaws in this become more apparent. Some of the things in Logan may seem like nitpicking (how does one drive a bullet-ridden limo through Texas into Oklahoma, for example, without anyone noticing until the minute it's pulled up to the hotel to be uh parked), some things may be sort of griping about the logistics of things (i.e. the comic book of X-Men is a plot element in this movie, like the X-Men comics exist, which would be a clever meta moment if it wasn't in the midst of the one of the darkest comic book movies ever made), and there are other beats that just have to do with how quickly (or, really, not) the villains don't catch up with our trio of main characters, Logan, Xavier and Julia, even when they literally have the coordinates to get to them. Not to mention some things in the last third of the movie that make things while not necessarily less violent or intense, a little more standard as a comic book movie, certainly as it's the 10th film in 17 years with an X-Men character from Fox.\n\nAll of this noted... this movie is really good. The reason for that is James Mangold, the director, taking a second (ahem, sorry, I can't resist) stab at this character and as it's the end he takes almost a rough R-rated Clint Eastwood 70's Peckinpah spaghetti-ish western approach to it all. And this is an BIG R rating, so parents take note, if you don't care about your kids hearing \"F\" and \"S\" words (and there's a lot of them, it's not like this got the rating for going over the 1 or 2 time minimum of PG-13 movies), then you might care about the various dismemberments, beheadings, stabs through the head, repeated stabbings *from children* onto nameless bad guys. Or maybe that won't be an issue either; in that case this is a dark tragic western for the whole family about a mutant who is slowly dying from adamantium poisoning driving his 90 year old dementia-ish father figure with a little girl so they can find a possible Eden. If one feels a Children of Men vibe too I wouldn't say that was unintentional.\n\nBut alongside Mangold's commitment to going for something we haven't seen before, what matters most in these movies to me more than the plot or stories more-often - the interactions of the characters, the emotional weight, how characters do (or don't) grow since, you know, once an a-hole always an a-hole - that works spectacularly. This is maybe the most deeply felt of the X-Men films, or at least as close as Days of Future Past was, as far as showing us how these characters are in great pain and danger and grappling with things, but we also get to see more dimension than before. With Xavier, for example, a lot of time in past movies (certainly the first three) while played by an actor with gravitas like Stewart, he was an exposition machine. Here, Xavier gets to show anger, resentment, sadness, pain, misery, confusion (genuinely, remember he's 90 here), and even a moment where he gets to help a farmer coral his horses (it's a minor but important one). And damn if Stewart doesn't deliver the goods; I can praise Jackman high as he does deserve it, and the young newcomer playing the mutant Julia is incredible (mostly in how she listens and her subtle moments in silences), this is Oscar-worthy s*** from Stewart.\n\nSo I think if you have really enjoyed most over the years how the actors and characters have interacted the most, regardless (or regardful) of how it strays from the comics (a touch that gets commented on here, for better or worse), Logan gives that score with moving fashion. If you are interested in a coherent story, that's here too... up to a point. It's a good send off for these characters."

        "review_detailed_main": "Logan unlike most movies featuring superheroes and villains; unlike movies from Marvel Studios, Logan takes itself seriously and at every moment, with perhaps one of the most serious tone not just among superhero movies, but cinematography in general. Logan tells a gripping, yet depressing tale about the fall of the X-Men and Logan's attempt to adjust to the world around him. The movie does not glorify superheroes, but in fact portrays the world as it is; grim, evil and oppressing. Whereas most superhero movies contain the general, hero's journey plot, with a more positive tone (sometimes to the point of absurdity), Logan disregards the common tropes, breaking most of the rules common to superhero movies, and it does so with great success. Truthfully, Logan cannot and shall not be deemed as \"a superhero movie\", as the focus of it lies not in the superpowers of the main character or the collaboration between characters in flashy costumes and red capes (yes, The Avengers, I'm taking about you) to achieve a common goal of defeating the typical bad guy. Instead, focus lies in such aspects as visual storytelling, strong character development and realistic relationships, as well as realistic portrayal of the world. In a few words, without spoiling the plot, Logan is mainly about a broken man, oppressed and persecuted by the world around him and about his transformation from a broody, ruined Logan, into a respectable and caring person, showing that even the most broken of people have a bright side to them. Fortunately, that is where the lighthearted tone ends, as the movie quickly transforms into the gripping, grim tale it is. The R rating given to this movie only supports the point it is trying to make, and is not for the faintest of heart. Logan's realistic portrayal of the world we live in as well as Logan himself sets this movie apart from many movies I have seen, and especially its superhero \"competition\". There is enjoyment to be found for both dedicated fans and casual viewers, although I strongly recommend viewing every movie in the X-Men universe before viewing this, as this movie marks an end to the series (so far), at least timeline wise, as it is Hugh Jackman's very last performance as Logan, and the movie thus acts as a perfect and fitting closure for his long, developed story. While X-Men fans will enjoy the movie more, casual viewers will find it enjoyable too due to the fact that the story is self-contained and sparsely based on and related to previous films, making the story quite easy to understand and follow, without prior exposure to the X-Men universe. Overall, this is a great movie about a realistic depiction of the world around us and how even the most broken people can redeem themselves. This movie gets 8 out of 10 starts from me, which places it in the 250 best movies of all time, and that is an achievement to be proud of. It does not get higher rating because although however great it is, it isn't the greatest movie of all time and cannot and shall not be compared to the likes of The Godfather or The Shawshank Redemption, arguably two of the best movies of all time. Either way, 8 stars is an appropriate rating for this movie and I strongly recommend it to both hardcore fans and casual viewers."

But the mood of the first half of \"Logan\" is quite reminiscent of Nolan's work, as it brings a realism and humanity to these familiar, fantastic characters. There's something fascinating about an old, broken down Wolverine limping around half-drunk. Maybe I'm strange, but I almost wish the entire movie was just like the beginning: documenting the uninspiring life of washed up superheros. However, they just couldn't help themselves and the film's final act devolves into the typical kind of nonsense I've come to expect from Marvel movies. It almost seems like a different film at the end from the one that started.\n\nI can't help but feel this was a missed opportunity to make a true statement and break the mould of superhero movies (a rare thing indeed in today's world of movies by corporate committee). While \"Logan\" is entertaining and certainly worth watching, I was reminded of the 2016 film \"Midnight Special,\" which also features a strange young child on the run, and perhaps does a better job of it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Logan is one of the warmest superhero movies I have seen. James Mangold, who is known for extracting some really heartwarming movies like CopLand (Sylvestor Stallone's finest performance), Girl,Interrupted (Angelina Jolie won an Oscar) & Walk The Line (Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon give outstanding performances) and also thrillers like Identity (mind boggling thriller), 3:10 to Yuma (remake of a classic western) & Knight and Day (Tom Cruise all the way), makes a movie that possesses both these qualities in equal proportion. It seems that the 'blue potion' helps unleash the Wolverine out of Logan giving us one of the most dynamic characters in the Marvel series.\n\nLogan is about this junkie cab driver whose past does not seem to let him go. The movie LOGAN shows us how sometimes even a super hero has to deal with his inner demon. The movie revolves around the impeccable character Wolverine and his undefined love for Professor X and the new mutant Laura (Dafne Keen). The chemistry between Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart is to die for making this superhero franchise a more human touch.  The movie in many parts is inspired by one of the classiest Western movie \"SHANE\" (A highly recommended movie by Chapter 8). Much like Shane, this movie also defines the untold duties of a man and his quest to differentiate between right and righteous. The new mutant played by Dafne Keen has risen hopes for all the fans and to look forward for the next X-Men movie.Hugh Jackman has really molded the character of Wolverine as per his convenience and it is difficult to see any other actor play this 'lone wolf'. The story focuses more on the next generation mutants who look out for Logan as the guiding force. The action sequences are spot on, and it is the claws that bring out the real wolf in Wolverine. The best part was the director's little references to X-Men comics and when the cross becomes the 'X' symbolizing X-Men at the end of the story."

        "review_detailed_main": "For over 30 years, the X-Men have been the concept, fictional characters, stories, genre IP, or whatever you want to call it, closest to my heart and my soul.\n\nWhen the first two films came out, I was in awe that they had gotten so close, as close as I could ever expect, to bringing them to life onscreen. Time and comparisons of what has come since have not been kind. The series has had its ups and downs. And they had to start somewhere in creating a universe with a diverse cast of characters and rich storytelling history. But they will always have a special place in my heart.\n\nThe series had gotten to the point where I haven't even seen the last 3? 4? 6? in a theater upon release.\n\nThat includes \"Logan.\" I'd heard it was good, but I never felt an urgency (or even an urge) to make it a priority to watch, even as I caught up with the other ones. I've been waiting for like 2 years for it to leave FX so I could watch it without commercials. I got over it and watched it on FXNow this weekend, which somehow I still have access to through the cable company even though I don't pay for the TV side?\n\nAnyway, I'm glad I waited. Waited for Fox to finish mangling the franchise into whatever b*st*rdized and bowdlerized nonsense they could imagine.\n\nThis serves as the most fitting capstone and epitaph to the film franchise. Not so much as it was, but for what it could and should have been in more capable, caring, careful hands.\n\nAnd damn, it is a great film. As a film, it may be the greatest single comic \"adaptation\". Including \"The Dark Knight\" which I have always felt is overrated (outside of Heath Ledger's performance). It's not the most satisfying, the most fun, most exciting. But as a film, it takes you exactly where it wants you to go, without any flaws.\n\nIt made me emotional, obviously, or I wouldn't have written all this for an almost 4 year old movie. And that's not anything new for me and comic book movies. But it made me emotional in ways that none of the others have. Not at the wonder of finally seeing all this on screen. But through the pathos put on screen."

        "review_detailed_main": "James Mangold and Hugh Jackman teamed up to make a different Wolverine movie: more serious, inspired by westerns, in which our hero has to deal with mortality and regret, while being on the lam with a girl. That movie was called \"The Wolverine\". For \"Logan\" they decided to do something bold and different by... doing exactly the same, while adding nothing to Wolverine's story, except an ending. Okay, this time the girl is a child with special powers (you know from the trailer and the DVD jacket that she is connected to Wolverine; I won't spoil details), which makes the plot go exactly in the same beats as as every adult-with-child-on-the-lam flick, from \"Escape to Witch Mountain\" and \"Firestarter\" to \"Midnight Special\". The villains in their vans and helicopters behave like all those on-the-lam villains who somehow always arrive quickly to wherever the protagonists are, even at times when there's no plausible reason. Innocent people are befriended on the way, and pay a price.\n\nBut yes, it is well shot, with well directed action, some style, and good performances. Back in the 80s, \"X-Men\" fans were campaigning for a movie to be made, with Clint Eastwood a fan favorite choice as Wolverine. Thus it is perhaps no surprise that style-wise and plot-wise, \"Logan\" behaves like if Clint Eastwood had made it, taking inspiration from multiple Eastwood flicks: \"Pale Rider\", \"Unforgiven\", \"A Perfect World\", and even small shades of \"Gran Torino\" and \"Million Dollar Baby\". It also references some classic anti-Westerns of the 1950s, going as far as including a \"Shane\" homage. All of this it pulls off well, but you do feel like you've seen this too many times before.\n\n\"Logan\" also pretends to be a \"Mad Max\"-like dystopian movie, but then it turns out that they're just in the US-Mexico border, and other than the lack of new mutants, the world looks exactly like the 2010s, despite it being 2029 or so. In fact, there's been no change to every day technology, including cars, cell phones and TVs. Only the villains seem to possess advanced technology, in the shape of cybernetic arms and advanced cloning abilities. The villains (The Reavers) are unimpressive, with the most powerful one being a metaphor of Wolverine's aging issues. And no, Nathaniel Essex is not in this movie, despite how it was promoted. Boyd Holbrook plays Pierce as a cunning dangerous redneck, somewhat of a cross between Gary Oldman and Woody Harrelson, but less strong.\n\nThe story does not do us any service. Aside from the standard plot themes for this sub-genre of 'grumpy dying hero reluctantly takes on a child and goes on the lam', there's little added to the story. We learn of a grim fate of a half-dozen unnamed X-Men, but have no clue what happened to the dozens of other characters. We are left wondering how Wolverine suddenly started aging rapidly, with no good explanation given, or to how/when he retreated to a menial existence. We also wonder how Professor X turned into a babbling fool, other than dementia at age 90. Jackman and Stewart turn in great performances, even if Stewart's character bares only little resemblance to his prior incarnations. Perhaps you can justify it with how dementia changes some great people.\n\nWhat is different from the usual \"X-Men\" movies is the violent gore and the cursing. It shocks at first, then feels repetitive/gratuitous or over-the-top. I will say that the fight scenes are more effective, and overall in \"Logan\" the violence straddles a thin line between action and terror.\n\nSaving the film overall is the good chemistry between the leads, the acting, and the fact that you are watching Wolverine in action on the big screen."

Of course, this is fanservice in a way, but I found it very fitting and helped to show this contrast between the ideal superhero world and the harsh reality.\n\nThe slow narrative pace, the dreary world, the dialogues and emotions reduced to a minimum can unfold their effect on the viewer. In terms of genre, the movie is reminiscent of a modern western in many places. Logan has never been known for his emotional outbursts or witty humor. He has now come to terms with the fact that his life is different from that of \"normal\" people. He's used up and that's exactly what you notice from the first minute.\n\n'Logan' represents a worthy end for Wolverine, or for Hugh Jackman in his parade role. I can't imagine, in the best sense of the word, that there will be an actor in the future who can embody this role better.\n\n'Logan' is, for me, one of the best superhero movies out there."

        "review_title": "Logan Is A Dramatic Action Masterpiece, Not Just Another Superhero Entry",
        "review_detailed_main": "Back in 2016 a special film called Deadpool came out and wowed audiences due to its overall success, considering it was Rated R. I just need to take a moment and thank Deadpool for existing because if Deadpool didn't exist then Logan most likely would've never been made the way it was. Logan to me is a very special film. The hugest praise I can give this film is that it doesn't feel like a comic book superhero movie. Don't get me wrong I love comic book superhero movies, but we're at a time where some of these comic book movies are getting tiring and too familiar. Logan to me is secretly an extremely emotional and serious drama with bits of exceptional action. It is so nice to finally get an extremely dark and serious comic book movie, that treats it's overall product masterfully. Now I don't think Logan by any means, is a perfect film. I have now seen the film twice, opening night and a week after, and I do have to conclude factually, that it has a couple of knit-picky flaws. For the most part though, I think all these insignificant flaws are outweighed by all the positives in this film for sure. In conclusion, the two viewings of Logan have officially confirmed to me that this movie might just be my favorite Marvel film. Hugh Jackman's performance in Logan, is by far his best portrayal as Wolverine. It's quite intriguing to learn about and get behind the character as an older and weaker person. Patrick Stewart's performance as Charles Xavier also, is by far his best portrayal to the character. The new young actress in the film who plays Laura, Dafne Keen, was incredibly good in this film. Normally I get nervous when kid actors or actresses play huge roles in films because, typically they're never really good, but Dafne Keen's commitment to Laura's character is outstanding. These three characters are so grounded and so well developed, through the entirety of the film, to the point where it feels real. A lot of people have been calling Logan, \"The Dark Knight\" of the Marvel entries, and it most definitely deserves the title, because its by far the most realistic and serious Marvel film yet, and has some near Oscar-worthy performances. The only flaw I due have with this film is one character in particular played by Boyd Holbrook, who is a great Actor; I loved his work in Narcos. He plays the main villain in this film, and for me he came off as a little too over the top and clich\u00e9. For one, since his character acts sometimes silly in a couple of scenes, it kind of takes you out of the all-so realistic world the film Logan has developed. His character also takes kind of that MCU villain route, where the villain is always trying to be funny like Loki, and I didn't buy it too much in a couple of scenes with him. With that being said, his character wasn't terrible or anything, I just think he could've been improved upon. I think that just might be my only solid flaw with Logan. Everything else in this film works so well, and is crafted with such care and commitment. Now, the action in the film is freakin' crazy. It is all-over-the-place gore splats, slicing people, bodies flying everywhere violent. From a X-Men standpoint its probably the best action that has ever been done in an X-Men film so far. The choreography for every actors and actresses fight scenes where done professionally. I was worried that the character Laura's action scenes in the film would look fake, since she is a little girl doing action scenes. To my surprise it all looked significantly real, which is to be praised for. This review is spoiler-free and I can't get too into details about the synopsis of the film but all you really need to know is that, going into this film, expect a satisfying, action, drama. Don't go into this film expecting another Days of Future Past, or a Civil War, or even a Dark Knight-like film. because Logan is able to stand on its own so well just like Deadpool was able to do. Like I said, Logan is my favorite Marvel movie ever made so far, and I'm going to give it a grade letter of an \"A\" and a IMDb score of a 10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "I decided December would be X-Men month. Watching the films in chronological order so I understood the storyline. In comparison to the avengers storyline, X-Men barely seemed worth making, the concept is solid, but the end product lacked in almost all accounts, 2d characters, bad villains, poor pacing,And bad writing. I would have probably placed the X-Men franchise around 4.5/10. Then I watched Logan. Had every other x-men film been created to the same standard as Logan (exceptions being the Deadpool series), avengers would have a serious contender. From the outset the grittier violence level, darker tones and lack of silly outfits sets this apart immediately. Picking out a small cast of remaining mutants only helps as it finally gives the audience time to develop a relationship with the X-Men, understand their flaws, and garnish them with a sense of humour, something the franchise has been lacking dearly in its overwhelming pursuit of seriousness. Stripping back the X-Men, and removing much of the technology, vast casts, and grandeur did Logan a world of good. The improved writing really allowed Hugh Jackman to shine, well beyond what I thought he was capable of, and despite sharing the screen with Patrick Stewart, he really held his own, as did Dafne Keen. Keen really did shine bright here, despite. Being mute for most the film she still managed to feed us with enough character. This is a brilliant film, I can understand where my fellow reviewers are coming from but I think many of them are wrong to be overly critical. This was an outstanding addition to the franchise. Void of all the previous X-Men failings. It should have always been gritty and well thought from the very beginning.\n\n8/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Since his debut on screen in 2000's X-Men, grizzled mutant Logan aka Wolverine became a fan favourite, the poster boy for the then budding new series and a career defining role for Australia's very own favourite son Hugh Jackman.\n\nA lot has changed since that memorable debut in Bryan Singer's well-liked comic book hit, for Wolverine as a character, most of that revolves around a lot of crumby cameos and forgettable solo adventures but proving once and for all that good things come to those that wait, Jackman and his The Wolverine director James Mangold have decided enough was enough and finally given the many fans of the clawed mutant the film they've been calling out for.\n\nLogan, a downright glum and violent affair is very far from the \"perfect\" film but considering where this character has come from and where it seemed like he was likely to stay, Mangold's film is one worthy of the name and this Western inspired road trip provides a sense of closure when it comes to the Wolverine name, in that we can finally say Jackman did all he could with this creation that gave birth to his enjoyable international career.\n\nA film that ends up being slightly too long in the claw, Logan is 130 minutes of dust covered, blood strewn and anti-children's entertainment that leverages Marvel's new found \"older\" audience targeting that did them so well with Deadpool and their Netflix events, as a now withered and old Logan is trying to live a quiet life as a driver for hire whilst supporting an ailing Professor X only to be thrown headfirst into a violent battle to protect mutant child Laura who acts as a surrogate daughter to the bearded ex-hero.\n\nThis set-up allows Mangold and Jackman to explore Logan on a deeper level, as the near suicidal man struggles to find meaning behind his sombre existence and Jackman delivers his best turn yet as the character while many fanboys will appreciate the time he gets to spend with Professor X (who I would argue gets too much screen time uttering Logan's name on repeat for the majority) and it's a chance to finally see the famed mutant act out some seriously impressive carnage.\n\nThe action in Logan is where the film truly shines and from the film's opening minutes you're acutely aware that this is not a film you'll be watching with the younger members of your family.\n\nLimbs are lopped, chopped, sliced and diced and Mangold isn't afraid to linger on the killing that sometimes needs to be done and for all those years we've endured rather forgettable Wolverine fight scenes, Logan certainly does more than enough to make up for this.\n\nWith action a high point of the film, Logan's not so amazing moments come from a story that starts to drag come the final stretches and with a finale that will be far from many people's memories come a few months' time, it feels as though Logan wasn't entirely sure of itself when it came to delivering the goods come the films conclusion.\n\nIt's nice to see Marvel shy away from \"city destruction\" and an evil villain that just wants to take over the world but you can't help but feel the earlier beginnings of Logan signposted a far more \"epic\" final act, not one with a bunch of children running around a forest and a bottle of peptides.\n\nA fine final outing for Jackman and his Wolverine to be a part of, Logan is without doubt the best solo Wolverine adventure and easily one of the best X-Men orientated feature films that draws out Jackman's best performance in some time and introduces us to newcomer Dafne Keen, who does a great job in her portrayal of Laura.\n\nThere's nothing truly ground-breaking here but it's certainly refreshing to see Marvel willing to keep expanding their horizons and deliver different takes on stories and characters that have flooded our cinema screens for nearly two decades and while this overlong trip is lacking a little in the emotional stakes and features a few to many corny circumstances, it's unlikely the images of Logan enacting out his sweet form of justice will be forgotten anytime soon.\n\n3 \u00bd bowls of cornflakes out of 5"

Newcomer Dafne Keen is lovable and highly watchable as Laura. Patrick Stewart brings a sad but tender Professor Charles Xavier. But with Logan himself, the detachment and the coldness are almost unbearable. He just seems... bothered by the whole affair. While retiring to the quiet life would be everyone's dream, you just don't get that when you're a mutant with metal claws and healing powers. We never see the true hero Logan has been and could be again. Overall, this reviewer enjoyed the film, but found it too depressing an end to Hugh Jackman's portrayal of the Wolverine."

But, it feels significantly more reserved than his others work in this universe \"The Wolverine.\"\n\nFashioned much more like an old-fashioned western like \"True Grit,\" the baddies feel more like a throwaway sorry Boyd Holbrook, but the villain is the environment itself. Hugh Jackman's quote, \"Nature made me a freak, man made me a weapon, and God made it last too long,\" permeates the viewer with a deep sense of the pain. \"Logan\" is a story about regaining that humanity by fighting for what is right, albeit this fight is forced upon him when encountered with child female clone of himself. Dafne Keen's Laura character (X-23!!!) is arguably the most enjoyable performance in this film despite having very few lines or even screen time. Jackman's capability as an actor is apparent, often evoking an emotional response that continues to gnaw at you long after you leave the theater. If you are able to gloss over the few continuity issues (how does she reach the pedals?!) or the plot holes (you seriously want me to believe that all the x-men are gone because of GMO corn?), \"Logan\" is a very enjoyable movie. 7/10"

Logan is proof that the superhero genre is not stagnant and can work on so many levels. Prime's The Boys (2019) and the Deadpool films where further proof of that.\n\nLogan pulls no punches with it's hard R rating. The level of violence is staggering, yet not gratuitous. These characters live in a bleak and harsh world that barely gives you time to breath. James Mangold steps his (and the genres) game up after the mediocre The Wolverine (2013) with such a superbly crafted film, that I personally expect nothing less from him for the rest of his already very impressive career.\n\nDafne Keen's breakthrough performance is comparible to Natalie Portman in The Professional (1994). Everything about this film is perfectly executed and it's one of the greatest superhero films ever made."

        "review_title": "A Gritty, Emotional Farewell to an Iconic Character",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Logan,\" released in 2017, is not just another installment in the X-Men franchise. It's a raw, gritty, and deeply emotional exploration of the iconic Wolverine character, brilliantly portrayed by Hugh Jackman in what has been billed as his final appearance in the role. Directed by James Mangold, \"Logan\" pushes the boundaries of the superhero genre, delivering a film that is as much a poignant drama as it is an action-packed adventure.\n\nSet in a dystopian near-future, \"Logan\" sees an aged, weary Wolverine caring for a debilitated Professor X, played by Patrick Stewart. When a young mutant named Laura (Dafne Keen) enters their lives, they're forced on a cross-country journey that feels more akin to a classic western than a traditional superhero film.\n\nJackman delivers a career-best performance in his farewell to the character he's embodied for nearly two decades. His Wolverine is worn down, haunted, and deeply vulnerable, yet still capable of intense ferocity. Jackman brilliantly navigates this complex emotional terrain, creating a deeply human character whose struggle with his past and fear of his future resonate profoundly.\n\nStewart, too, delivers an exceptional performance as Professor X. His portrayal of a man grappling with a formidable brain disorder while still trying to mentor Logan and protect Laura is moving and nuanced. The relationship between Logan and Professor X is richly drawn, revealing new dimensions to these familiar characters.\n\nNewcomer Dafne Keen is a revelation as Laura. Her performance is fierce and touching, offering a fitting counterpart to Jackman's Wolverine. Her interactions with Jackman are among the movie's highlights, providing a unique father-daughter dynamic that's rarely seen in superhero films.\n\nVisually, \"Logan\" is a departure from its glossy, CGI-laden counterparts. The film's grounded cinematography and real-world settings add to the gritty realism that sets it apart. The action sequences, while brutal and visceral, never feel gratuitous. Each blow, each battle, feels deeply personal and consequential, adding to the overall emotional impact.\n\nThe script, co-written by Mangold, tackles themes of loss, redemption, and the harsh cost of violence. There's an undercurrent of melancholy that runs throughout the film, amplified by the stripped-down, soulful score by Marco Beltrami.\n\n\"Logan\" is a testament to the depth and richness that can be achieved within the superhero genre. It's a deeply affecting, character-driven piece that offers a fitting farewell to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. With its superb performances, thoughtful narrative, and visceral action, \"Logan\" is a standout entry in the X-Men franchise and a bold, unforgettable piece of cinema."

Environment blending in with the characters aging and deterrence; squeaky car/buildings/clothes etc.. (very nice touch).\n\nBut..\n\nThe overall impression was close to something like; your personal (DIY) home pet project, where you start off with the most accuracy in fixing that fence, or repainting that old mold infested corner in the ceiling, caring for the specifics and all the little details, until you find your self rushing off the job just for sake of getting it done!!\n\nAnd that's what in my personal opinion happened with this assignment, where it felt as the pace climaxed at around the first 20 minutes then duplicated it self thus gradually losing any fertility for potential.\n\nIn what felt like a mash up between \"blood father\", \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\", and \"mad max:, there could have been more done to what is considered as the finale for the evolution of the character on screen, especially after all the years of trial and error, instead of exhausting all the art at the beginning and cruising on the protagonists name for the rest of the screen using it for commercial advertisement to mobile phones, breakfast cereals and automobiles.\n\nWhen maybe a cocktail of \"300\", \"Saving Private Ryan\", \"Terminator salvation\" perhaps would have been more fulfilling in bringing out the protagonist's essence accumulated in the collective portrait of \"Wolverine/Logan\" fan boy generations over the years with his; instinctual beastly charisma, primitive confrontational manner, and repressed superego.\n\nIn conclusion aside from the artistic concentration at the beginning, Patrick Stewart's master performance, and some of the catchy paradoxes in the story line, I think the overall rating should linger between (7,4) and (7) on the IMDb scale."

A lot of drag in this movie, so much that I wanted to leave 15 mins before the end while watching this in IMAX.\n\nOverall it is not a bad movie and would have given it 7.5 if I could but definitely not 8."

        "review_detailed_main": "The theme of the film is quickly revealed from the very first scene that it's not like any of the previous X-Men movie as the R rating appears from the very first second and it actually introduced the X-Men universe to the reality dimension. Acting :\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Everyone in this film was giving another level of performance that we weren't used to from the very same characters. Hugh Jackman did the best performance as Logan in his 17 year long performance and his best performance since his Oscar-nominated performance. The amount of pain and suffer that Logan and Charles went through over the years was expressed by Hugh and Sir. Patrick were priceless and their expressions could deliver a flow of mixed emotions that would hit every X-Men fan right in the heart. Making her debut as X-23, the wonderful child Dafne Keen gave one of the most strong child performances ever that blow our mind and we wouldn't ask for a better representation for this character. Score : \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 By Marco Beltrami (who is also the composer of A Quiet place I and II) gave an intense, thrilling and powerful score that added to the greatness of each scene that will make you on the edge of the seat most of the time. The kind of soundtrack that gives you chills. Cinematography : \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd By John Mathieson (who is also the cinematographer of Gladiator) was brilliant!! It makes you feel like you are right in the action especially the cars chasing scenes and the camera movements during it. Also the wide shots ( as in photo no. 4) was artistic as it could be. The lightning at some shots was just perfect making the shots at some points as a beautiful painting. The only flaw it had was the decision to shoot some fight scenes (especially the last one) in a single shot to emphasize the brutality and violence in them which the CGI didn't help in. VFX : \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 The visual effects were great but had obvious flops at critical points of the movie especially the last fight scene which was the grand finale of the whole movie which only the brutality, excitement and shock could save. The plot : \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd The story is for sure strong and unique from the other X-Men films and the best among them. It's only enough that it introduced us to a new aspect of the whole X-Men universe and it's quite shocking and powerful events that just won't let you move your eyes of the screen, but it was quite predictable for how it's going to end and sometimes brought exaggerated violence which was at points unnecessary to keep us attracted. Direction : \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd By the one and only James Mangold, who saved this franchise after the huge flop and disappointment the 1st film gave us. He made us worry whether this film is going to give Wolverine the ending he deserves or not especially that the 2nd film had mixed reactions but he did give us just the movie we were hoping for and even exceeded our expectations at certain points. Every shot of this film is well studied and artistic as it could possibly be creating the great atmosphere and the beauty that comes out of this brutal world making it an immortal film and one of the all time great. A great Job indeed. A movie that will make you excited, entertained, cry and smile. One hell of a journey it has been. Logan (2017) : \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd Favourite Quote : Charles Xavier: Logan, you still have time."

The storyline allows Hugh Jackson and Patrick Stewart to showcase their acting abilities (a big step up for both from the 2D comic book characters they played in other entries in the franchise). There are a number of plot holes and inconsistencies, but that's nothing new for the genre and, all in all, the story is interesting and (spoilers hinted at) its position in the overall X-man/Wolverine story-arc allows outcomes not possible in earlier chapters. Probably as close to that oxymoron \"an adult-superhero movie\" as I've seen (other than the much superior \"The Dark Knight\").

Logan is the first film I have watched within the \"X-men universe\" or whatever you call it, and it was great. \"Logan\" follows a now old and bitter Wolverine, who is waiting to die with no purpose in his life. That changes when he encounters a child, a mutant.\n\nA great part about \"Logan\" is its relationships. The dynamic between Logan and Charles is a great father-son relationship and it's great to follow. Likewise, it's great to follow the dynamic between Logan and Laura and their father-daughter relationship. She brings something different out of Logan and makes him rethink his view on life and his decisions.\n\nThe story in this film is great. The story is sometimes slow but still enjoyable and not boring. It isn't that complicated of a story, but it manages to keep the viewer on their toes through the whole movie while creating an interesting story where the tension continues to gradually rise and rise until it culminates at the very end. Visually the film is impressive. It is aesthetically very pleasing to look at and it makes great use of different colors and different environments.\n\nThe great visuals continue when it comes to the action which is also great. The action is fast-paced, hard-hitting, and brutal. It is also easy to follow and the combat looks absolutely brutal which is great. The decision to make this film rated R is a great one. The action wouldn't have been as great without the brutality and gore made possible by the R-rating. It is also refreshing to hear unfiltered language in films, especially a movie like \"Logan\" which could've been turned into a marvel-like superhero film, which wouldn't have fit at all.\n\nHugh Jackman as Logan is absolutely amazing. He brings a great performance and he contributes a lot to Logan being the badass that he is in this movie.\n\nTo summarize, \"Logan\" is a great film about redemption and is absolutely worth a watch. I'm not sure if having not watched the prior films made my experience of watching \"Logan\" better or worse, but I can say that you should watch it even if you haven't watched the other films."

It's more a drama in the Sydney Lumet's Running on empty tradition mixed with a road movie (if you don't consider Running on empty a road movie itself). Obviously there are characters with superpowers or enhanced skills, cyborgs, adamantium claws and telepathic stuff but the action scenes just cover less than a third of the whole movie. Maybe is a more mature movie amid its genre than usual but I felt that it lacks a lot of entertainment. At least the kind of fun I expect from a superhero movie. I recognize the risk that the authors have assumed with this kind of story but I don't find it too original. I didn't like a lot the previous Mangold's Wolverine movie and I disliked Origins but to rank all three from best to worst; 1 The Wolverine, 2 Logan, 3 Origins. I think that they have missed a great opportunity with a really great character. I would have enjoyed much more a Bryan Synger's X Men movie style (but discarding Apocalypse) So Long Hugh Jackman's Wolverine"

        "review_title": "Hugh Jackman in his last go around as Wolverine",
        "review_detailed_main": "I missed this film when it was in theaters. That is probably for the best, not that I had any desire to see it then due to the fact my fianc\u00e9 had just recently passed away. If I had seen it, it probably would have triggered an attack. It still did, but at least I was in my own home so no one could see me break down. Just anything like this makes me remember the love of my life and the tears just pour out and I end up having an attack and have trouble breathing. That being said, this was a very good movie and a nice way to send off Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Sure, there are things that make me question what has happened to reduce everyone to the state they are in, but when one reads comics, one understands that the story being presented may be sort of an alternate universe story arc, rather than the main one. I say this is the case with this movie, things may not necessarily turn out the way they did in this film, just in this universe things seemed to have gone very badly. It is a way to change up the actor playing Wolverine and get some closure for the X-men films starring him and Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier.\n\nThe story has Logan as a limo driver trying to earn enough cash to get a boat so that he and Professor Xavier can escape to the sea. Xavier is having trouble controlling his powers in his old age and Logan watches over him as there are hints that the professor has done something rather bad due to this lack of control. Logan is being assisted by a mutant named Caliban who has the ability to detect other mutants, a power nearly worthless now as mutants have become few and far between. Well, a woman tries to get Logan to help her as she has a young girl with her and some men are tracking both of them. This girl is apparently a mutant with some very familiar powers. Logan escapes with her and Professor Xavier and they must stay one step ahead of the agents determined to capture her. However, there is another familiar face that is unleashed in the agents efforts to recapture the young girl and several other mutant children trying to flee their grasp.\n\nI enjoyed the film for the most part, the only problem I had is that I was hoping for someone cooler when they revealed the soulless mutant who had no problem killing. They really did not have anyone new as far as mutants on display as Caliban was the only one I do not think was seen before. I would have liked the reveal to show the new weapon to be Omega Red. Granted, that would have meant a few more special effects I guess so we do not really get anyone new at all on display.\n\nSo the film was good and the action was plentiful and quite gruesome. I knew there would be a bit more stuff shown because this film was rated R, but I was surprised at how many heads rolled and appendages flying everywhere. From what a few people had said about the film that I know, there really was not much action in the film. Not sure what film they were watching as there was a good deal. So ends Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and he did a good job in the role. I just find the makers starting with Marc Singer really did not do the character true justice as he was a much better fighter than the films portrayed, and his healing ability was not as effective in the comics as depicted in the films either. Basically, he was more apt to dodge in the comics than go head on and he would never have any problems fighting ordinary men and most superheroes could not match his fighting skills. Still, as I said, I just think of it as an alternative universe and it still saddens me to see Jackman depart the role."

        "review_title": "Logan is a brutal and emotional film that encapsulates everything good about its genre.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Coming off last year's rather disappointing X-Men: Apocalypse, I really didn't know what to expect from Logan. I was not too impressed by The Wolverine so I was wary of being overly excited. After the initial buzz from the first press screenings, however, my expectations skyrocketed. Fortunately, they were met and surpassed. Logan is a brutal and emotional film that encapsulates everything good about its genre.\n\nFrom the very opening, the the tone is set and you immediately notice just how bloody and brutal it is. Thanks to the film's age restriction, director James Mangold has the full freedom to go as far as the story calls for. There is excessive swearing but it never comes off as forced; it's natural because the situations that these characters are put in are dire. Another thing that fascinated me was that the gore was not gratuitous and was used effectively.\n\nAs far as the story goes, it takes place in 2029, sometime after all X-men are dead but for Logan, Charles and Caliban. We don't know why and how but we are given pieces of the puzzle throughout the film that we need to put together in order to understand what has gone wrong. Logan is now old and tired of life, offering a service similar to Uber until one they his car is wrecked. I'll leave it at that as the less you know when you go in to see it, the better.\n\nLogan never treats the audience as if it is dumb and doesn't spoon-feed us every single thing that is going on. Moreover, the story is so told in such a masterful manner that upon leaving the auditorium, you will have seen a film with a beginning, a middle and an end\u2014something rare these days, especially in the superhero genre. The end of the second act is by far one of the most suspenseful and shocking ones I have seen in a long while. The entire movie is intense and doesn't let you get distracted even for a second; you're glued to the screen.\n\nA big contributor to that, apart from the fantastic direction and cinematography, is the acting. Almost everyone gives an exceptional performance (save for Stephen Merchant, who is a hit or miss) but the standouts are, as you might have expected, Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart. The former is harrowing as the guilt and tiredness from Logan's long life is taking its toll on him, while Stewart gives an incredibly nuanced performance with exquisite subtlety. Dafne Keen is quite stellar as well, even if she doesn't play the most likable of characters. What she does in her action scenes is commendable.\n\nWhile the film's explored themes have definitely been dealt with before, it has its own spin on them to make them thought-provoking: are corporations too unregulated? Where should a line be drawn? Does good always win or does evil overpower it sometimes? Is immigration a solution to some problems? Do you choose yourself or should you go out of your way to help the others? These and many other questions are asked but you don't always get a straight answer. Rather, you need to make up your own mind about it.\n\nIt is deeply emotional as well. Even though it is based on a comic-book, it isn't of the type 'let's save the world.' Instead, it's a much smaller, and therefore, a more personal film about dealing with loss and illnesses, moral dilemmas, and explores the line as to when your actions are justifiable and when you've turned into a monster.\n\nNot burdened by the task to set up a plethora of sequels and prequels, the director has crafted an impeccable film about what it means to be human and how far we are willing to go for those we care about. Logan doesn't cut away from the horror that one may afflict upon others and effortlessly scrutinises the motivations behind its characters' decisions. Combine that with the brutal but exceptionally executed action scenes and you end up with a film that elevates the superhero genre."

        "review_detailed_main": "Now, first and foremost I must stand forth and say that superhero movies is not my go-to pick of movies when presented with alternate choices. Why? Well, because I just don't really enjoy the superhero theme all that much. Usually, they provide nothing more than visual entertainment for me.\n\nHowever, I will say that \"Logan\" manages to stand out in the superhero genre; a genre that is well-diluted with mediocre attempts of bringing comic book heroes to life on the big screen. \"Logan\", however, steps away from the absurdly generic mould that superhero movies tend to follow, and it is not the superhuman powers of the characters that is the drive behind the movie.\n\nWhat makes \"Logan\" so good and entertaining, is that this is a movie intended for a mature audience, and it leaves the generic superhero archetype behind as it has been seen in most previous \"X-Men\" movies. With that being said, I will also continue on to state that \"Logan\" is actually the best of all the installments into the \"X-Men\" universe on the big screen so far.\n\nThis is a movie that is driven by a good story, and spiced up with good characters and good acting all around. This is also the most violent and bloody of all the \"X-Men\" movies, take it as it is, like it or dislike it - that is a personal preference, of course. I did, however, enjoy the approach and the more dark atmosphere that permeated this entire movie. It was refreshing not to see a rose-tinted superhero movie where you know that the heroes will prevail against insurmountable odds.\n\nSure, the effects in \"Logan\" are great, and they do help the movie along quite nicely.\n\nI was more than genuinely surprised with how good \"Logan\" turned out to be, and this movie does have enough entertainment contents to sustain multiple viewings. My rating for \"Logan\" is 8 out of 10 stars, without a doubt. And this is a well-worthy addition to the \"X-Men\" franchise."

They're both dealing with aging, losing control of their abilities. The next generation need their protection. One last ride.\n\nThird time's the charm. As close as the second solo outing got, this is what we've wanted from Wolverine right from when we saw him cage-fighting. And with X-23, or Laura(played to perfection by the incredibly talented young Keen), the torch is passed. The way is paved for the X-Force, as well as the New X-Men. This is a slow burn, and a road movie. The action is amazing, using the R-rating for the ferocity and brutality that is called for, never gratuitously. There is not as much of it as in other entries in the series, and if you're not that interested in the characters this studies, you probably won't be that compelled to watch this. You can go into this blind.\n\nThis has a lot of strong language, and brief nudity, in addition to what I've already described.

The finale takes chances that are unexpected from these types of production companies, and really brings out a lot of emotions that one might not expect to feel when walking into this movie. In the end I decided to give Logan a \"Good\" on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10. Although it's a little higher than I wanted to give it, this is one of those movies that I feel will age better with time, ironically the opposite of Logan's character in Logan.\n\nRead more at theVade."

Encore!\n\nThis is what Wolverine is about, this is the Wolverine movie I'd been waiting for.\n\n\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\" was alright. \"The Wolverine\" was about just as mediocre, but this... this was a masterpiece. This had depth, this had feeling, this had character.\n\nLogan is an older, disheveled, drunker, surlier character with diminishing abilities. He is rock bottom. Probably not the ideal Wolverine but it makes his character so much more layered. This is a Wolverine you will be familiar with but maybe slightly impatient with as well. But one thing is for sure, this movie (hence Wolverine) benefited from an R rating. It wasn't an R rating just for the sake of cheap sexual jokes or gratuitous nudity, rather it was an R rating in order for Wolverine to be Wolverine: a cutthroat killer that uses his claws for more than just neatly puncturing people.\n\nAs for Charles Xavier, he is older and suffering from the effects of old age which has diminished his abilities as well as made him highly volatile. They are alone with hardly any mutants left and not much more to live for--that is until a girl named Laura (Dafne Keen) comes into their lives.\n\nDafne Keen is wonderful as the little Laura. She has limited lines but she commands the screen nonetheless. She was both adorable and formidable and an indispensable part of the story line.\n\nIf you're looking for non-stop action, this isn't the movie for you. If you're looking for a good story with structure and pace and some well placed potent action, then this is for you. The movie may have been slow for some, but I'm an adult and I can tolerate a slow movie that has a purpose.\n\nThis was so much grittier and realler than just about any comic book/superhero movie. There was no saving the world, no saving the galaxy, not even saving a small town, but there was saving--and there was sacrifice. I love the movies that aren't afraid to make us angry or make us sad. Not the cheap anger that comes with every bad guy, or the cheap sadness that comes with the death of a good guy. I mean those movies, such as this one, that can cultivate and build to make an authentic anger and an authentic sadness. Not everyone can be saved, not everyone lives happily ever after and not everyone changes for the better. We try to reach those in need of saving--both literally and figuratively--but some people you can't reach. This movie had that.\n\nI could wax on much longer about this film I love it so much. For the sake of brevity I will conclude with this: Logan is that superhero movie done so well that the super abilities are second to the super story."

And even despite constant provocations, he does not want to harm anyone to anybody and attacks only when he is already being pressed. However, as you know, there is nothing more terrible than a beast driven into a corner. And then the offenders will regret that they dared to raise their hand against him and those close to him.\n\nThis is a very deep and humane film about an outcast, no one needs a single person, for whom his whole very long life was a constant struggle. Life is full of wars, pain, suffering ... disappointment. He never knew what peace was. He's did not know what it's like when you are really loved, when someone very much wants to be alive and close.\n\nSomeone like him. The same tortured outcast is a loner."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are my favorite actors. Hugh Jackman cemented his role as Logan(a.k.a. Wolverine of the X-Men) whereas Patrick Stewart immortalized himself as Captain Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation. As I am writing this review, Patrick Stewart is 76 years old. I don't think he will act in a film ever again. This film marks the departure for Hugh Jackman as Logan.\n\nBack to the film. First of all, I should say that this film is violent. Perhaps one of the most violent X-Men movies I have seen. Also those of you expecting over the top C.G.I. effects will be disappointed. The effects are kept to a minimum to keep the film going. More emphasis is played on the relationship between professor X. Xavier and Logan. The professor has become old and has to be medicated because he is suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Logan has stayed behind to look after him.\n\nCaliban an albino mutant who has the ability to track other mutants has also stayed behind to help both Xavier and Logan. He offers Logan a lot of good advice, however Logan snubs him in his usual gruff manner.\n\nThe film starts in the year 2029. mutants are on the brink of extinction, with no new mutants having been born in 25 years. James \"Logan\" Howlett, formerly known as Wolverine, spends his days working as a chauffeur in Texas. His healing factor has faltered and, as a result, his body has aged greatly.\n\nOne day, Logan is approached by Gabriela Lopez, a nurse for biotechnology corporation Alkali-Transigen, who wants him to escort her and an 11-year-old girl named Laura to a place in North Dakota called \"Eden\". After reluctantly accepting the job from Gabriela, Logan discovers that she has been murdered. Watch the film to find out what happens next...\n\nVerdict: Superb and mature acting by Hugh Jackman. He gives his best performance in what should be his last X-men film. During the screening of the film he and Stewart held hands and wept. This is no doubt due to the long relationship they had during the filming of the X-Men series of films. The cinematography and sound effects are adequate to the film. The film has a sort of gloomy/dismal setting which no doubt lets us know that the theme of the film is that all good things in life come to an abrupt end. People grow old - even mutants. But I do hope that the next generation has a bright future ahead of it.\n\nThank you for reading this review. Live long and prosper.\n\nMore Superhero Films To See: Condorman(1981), The Incredible Hulk Returns(1988), The Punisher(1988), Darkman(1990), Captain America(1990), The Guyver(1990), The Meteor Man(1993), Blankman(1994), The Phantom(1996), Unbreakable(2000), Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut(2006)."

On the other hand, it doesn't have too many things to deal with, and has a simple story that's easy to follow. But that simple story only works for two thirds of the runtime and the third act is a failure.\n\nThe harsh reality and the violence \"Logan\" is bold enough to have on screen go hand in hand both in the beginning and in the middle of the plot, but in the big finale, the plot twists and becomes complicated, and the elements it has to deal with get out of hand, stop making sense, raise questions, ruin what realism there was, and all that's left is the violence.\n\nDirector James Mangold had a strong third act in \"The Wolverine\" from 2013, and the rest of the runtime was boring because the movie couldn't handle the big material it had to deal with until things were clear and simple enough for the big final showdown. There was also a little prologue in that movie that did work, but again, that was just a handful of minutes and they were someone's memory. Here, the big picture is the opposite. It is the big final showdown that can't handle the material it deals with, here, the parts of the film that do work are the ones that didn't in \"The Wolverine\", the beginning and the middle. Fortunately, one failed piece out of three does not necessarily ruin the whole picture, but it does not make it good, either. Not when it's the finale."

Patrick Stewart's character is used to slow down the story and add an alternative viewing to Jackman's character.\n\nThe movie is generally fast-paced and exhibits a clear following throughout - the advancement is very much a journey, and a quest to peace and justice.

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a perfect conclusion for the X-Men saga, and a proper farewell for two massive characters in the cinecomic genre. Despite having just a few dialogue lines, Laura is a well built and very complete character, the actress performed really well. The director created a special bond between her and Logan. Professor Xavier in this case is more of a side character, but he is absolutely necessary because he is the glue that will guide the two heroes, accomplishing their main goal. The movie is not scared to show the deepest and human side of these mutants: we get to see their most intimate emotions, vulnerabilities and weaknesses. We do not have in front of us the typical superhumans that cannot be killed. This is the main reason why I particularly enjoyed this film. The ending is bittersweet and for sure is not the usual \"lived happily ever after\" stuff. This is the perfect conclusion for an amazing saga that I followed since I was a teenager. This is how I want to remember the X-Men. I really wish they stopped here, instead of milking this cow over and over again.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the movie is extremely solid: action scenes and stunts are well executed, the CGI is overall good and it is never over the top. Photography is well done, there are many interesting and creative camera angles. I really liked the fact that they focus more on practical effects,giving a more realistic look to the entire film. This is a big recommendation from my side."

        "review_detailed_main": "To say this movie is Extraordinary is an understatement. This is not only the best film in the X-Men franchise, but this is possibly the best Comic Book film ever made.\n\nThis film tells the story of a now aging Wolverine, who in this is but a shell of who he used to be. He aides a very decrepit Charles Xavier who is also in the same boat. Event's happen prior to the film that made these two just done with life. Their tired, there bitter, and want it all to end. Until they meet a girl named Laura, who's not so different from Wolverine, and gives them a chance of hoping in something bigger than themselves.\n\nHugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Stephan Merchant, Dafne Keen, Boyd Holbrook, all of them give it there all, and together made this movie such a powerful watch. Shoutout to Dafne Keen who really held her own with people like Jackman and Stewart.\n\nAnd the Action, oh my word...ITS SO BRUTAL!!! It is R RATED to the max! There are limbs chopped off, people stabbed, Heads Sliced off, you guessed it. It fits the mold of this movie so freaking well. This is the most brutal Wolverine has been, and that's the way it should be.\n\nThe Score fits as well. For being a more serious Comic Book film, the music did a great job with capturing the overall feeling of what Logan was going. Sometimes being very intimate, sometimes being Very Furious.\n\nI can tell you one thing about this film that I think everybody can agree on, Hugh Jackman gave it his all, and didn't apologize for it. I know We'll get him as Wolverine Once more in DP 3, but it will be Impossible for any other film to capture that kind of gravitas ever again. Well James Mangold, and well done Hugh. You did It. :)"

        "review_title": "Despite the action Logan is an unimpressive superhero movie.",
        "review_detailed_main": "'Logan' is the first movie (minus Deadpool) in the X-Men universe to receive an R rating. Unlike 'Deadpool' this film is not a comedy. Far from it actually. This film is a brutal action movie filled with excessive violence resulting in a surfeit of blood, gore, and cursing. Which, surprisingly enough, is what any fan of Wolverine as a character has been waiting for. Finally, we get to witness Hugh Jackman tear people limb from limb in glorious, graphic violence. For this film, the biggest selling point, aside from the R rating, was the fact that Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are hanging it up after this film. This film will mark their last performances as their respective characters.\n\nSo naturally, people want to see the only Wolverine they know be Wolverine one last time. And, thankfully, this film features an all around superb cast. Every actor in this movie is great with Jackman anchoring the film with his magnetic performance. Patrick Stewart also does a great job despite having fairly limited screen time. Even the young girl (X-23) did a fine job with what was given to her.\n\nBut the crowning achievement of the film is the action. This director also directed 'The Wolverine' which was equally strong action wise. The difference between the two films is that 'The Wolverine' feels stifled by its PG-13 rating. 'Logan' does not have this problem. All the action is well handled and horrifically violent. Every time someone gets stabbed blood sprays all over the place in glorious detail.\n\nAnd it should be shown in glorious detail because the rating is the biggest selling point. Which is why you should see this with a crowd. It's the perfect movie to see with people and reveal in the excessive violence we have all craved. Every time Jackman and his little girl whip out their claws the film gets a burst of life and energy that really resonates with a crowd. So, while I would recommend seeing this with a crowd to experience the impressive action, I can't say that I liked this film.\n\nIt's perfectly fine but the biggest problem comes in the form of the script. There are literally three screenwriters penning this movie. Writers who have such hit films as 'Marley & Me', 'Green Lantern', and 'The Wolverine' under their belt. Despite having three people looking at this script for who knows how long, it still feels like a first draft. Why? Because there is basically no story. Where the last Wolverine film was almost incoherent with its bloated story, hardly anything happens in 'Logan'.\n\nThe first thirty minutes is set up followed by an action scene that all works very well but the next 45-60 minutes is nothing. They go to a place and then leave and then go to a place and leave over and over again. It gets so repetitive and dull to the point of me actually falling asleep. In an R-rated X-Men movie. It's in this hour of time where we are left with so little story that you start to realize that there wasn't really a story to begin with.\n\nIt goes something like this: \"Take this girl to this place Wolverine.\" \"No. OK, fine I'll do it.\" And that's it. After he takes thirty minutes to accept this job he then takes two hours to complete this thin plot and that's the movie. It's nearly an hour of filler in a two and a half hour movie. If the film had this hour of filler cut out we would have had a great, straight up action movie. Instead, we have an uneven, poorly paced, thin story where not much happens.\n\nLike I said earlier, this is a perfectly acceptable action film. It has all the blood and gore you could ever want. It really pushes its R rating in the way we all wanted it too. Couple that with great performances and we should have had a great action movie. But, instead, the film is horribly bogged down with poor writing. Three screenwriters is never a good sign and it really shows here. There are endless action scenes followed by even more endless filler scenes. What results from this is overlong, thinly plotted, and an unevenly paced the film."

Awesome? Not really because the whole thing unfolds every bit as lame as you could imagine.\n\nThis creatively bankrupt paint-by-numbers production stretches the 5'3\" Wolverine to 6'3\". Invisible stilts anyone? Hollywood's version of Wolverine in \"Logan\" doesn't have much in common with the Marvel comics character, besides sharing the same name.\n\nThe pathetic ending, after the clich\u00e9d showdown with the doppelganger really had me scratching my head. This definitely isn't the Wolverine from the comics. Instead it's Hollywoods pale rip off for monetary gain.\n\nThe only ray of light here was Patrick Stewart's solid performance, who always delivers in his roles.\n\nEver since the seventies Stan Lee wanted to see his superheroes make a living in Hollywood, but ultimately by doing so Marvel sacrificed all integrity and identity.\n\nTo all longtime X-Men Comic fans, do yourself a favor stay away from this awful bastardization. It's devoid of any creative substance or even a hint of brilliance."

        "review_detailed_main": "Logan is by far one of the greatest superhero movies ever made. It's a drama focused , character driven and also action packed flick that captivated me since it's start. An authentic , gritty , bleak and hopeless drama takes place here , telling the story of 3 deeply developed main characters who won me over.\n\nLogan a tired , sickly , mean and hopeless man works as a limo driver to take care of the aging Charles Xavier who unlike him , besides his old age , is still hopeful , vibrant , sociable and full of life. These differing attitude and out look of theirs always puts them at odds and makes them argue a lot in a very emotional and sometimes humorous manner. I, for one really enjoyed seeing those two bicker.\n\nBut besides their differences , they look out for each other. Logan respects him a lot and feels like he owes him for taking him in back when he was young and lost. He feels like doing the same and repaying him by protecting him from the Government and everybody out there who wants to capture him ( since he's a wanted man with a very powerful mind capable of being used as a weapon ) and tending to his needs. They planned on saving some cash , buying a boat and leaving for good to live peacefully somewhere out there. Then all of a sudden this little girl , Laura shows up and messes up this plan of theirs and becomes another burden for Logan to carry.\n\nCharles as vigourus as he is makes Logan take her in besides his refusal. But taking care of her proves to be a tougher job since an army is after her. The plot goes on like this.\n\nThe writing was solid. I enjoyed every single dialogue between the characters as none of it was silly and padded out. None of the lines were wasted as each interchange served to develop the story and the characters. The acting by all was also superb. Hugh Jackman gave an amazing performance perfectly depicting Logan's angry , impatient and hopeless mien. Dafne Keen as the little mutant was sweet but also extremely fierce when she wants to be. And for the first time I didn't hate Boyd Holbrook at all. His smuggy and egotistic performance fitted his character well and made him a damn good villain. Sir Patrick Wilson as always was kind , polite and charming. The story was engaging and the gore throughout made the action scenes convincing. A genre defining movie that truly impressed me. A breath of fresh air after all the puerile junky comic movies Hollywood releases these days."

The film Logan undoes all that with it's need to be relentlessly depressing and dystopic. We learn that Logan and Prof. X are on the decline and aging badly. The X-Men have been eradicated, as has mutant kind. So all the work the X-Men did in DOFP was for NOTHING. The film is full of bad language and very gory violence. There is no humor or fun in this movie at all. Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman are to be commended for their strong performances and building a wonderful father/son relationship in the film, but the villains are so bland and boring and forgettable. I can't even remember their names! I kind hope Cable from the Dead Pool movies comes along and time travels and restores the X-Men to greatness again. These characters deserve better than what this movie does to them."

        "review_detailed_main": "Maybe it's a case of high expectations, but I was underwhelmed overall with this movie. It has ramp-ed up the violence to the max and the end is quite good but too many problems mar this movie to make it a hit: - the setting never quite clicks: 12 years in the future they have the same phones and the same TVs? Mutantkind was eradicated? Not a big deal but it never seems right - the movie is a road movie? An action movie? A mix of the both with a lot of dead times and fairly filler moments - What it is not is a super hero movie. It has some of its tropes but lacks the overall sense of wonderment a superhero flick needs - The bad guys and main threat are really **meh** So yeah Hugh Jackman is OK, Patrick Stewart is OK, seeing a Wolverine unleashed on the screen has its moments but overall somewhat disappointed."

        "review_detailed_main": "This gore-permeated, pathos-riddled final chapter of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine trilogy startles its audience with not one, but two curtain calls of iconic characters in the X-Men franchise, and director James Mangold (whose previous Wolverine vehicle is a styled but ultimately self-defeating oddity) ensures that his R-rated version will do something very different from other CGI-heavy products of Marvel cinema, where emotion vacuum has been repeatedly desensitized in favor of visual bombardment.\n\nThe scale is relatively small (no metropolitan city is threatened by impending danger), set in 2029 where mutants have been almost extinct (the reasons beyond that are both a woe of Professor X and a progressive measure from dietary intake), a world-weary Logan (Jackman), now moonlights as a limo chauffeur, traveling to-and-fro between USA and Mexico, to take care of a delirious Professor X, aka. Charles Xavier (Stewart), a mumbling nonagenarian and episodically inflicted by seizure and is unable to keep a tight rein on his psionic superpower, can only be tamed by medication, meanwhile the albino mutant Caliban (Merchant, a bug-eyed phantom actually has a golden heart) is Logan's sole help.\n\nAll Logan wants is to save enough money and buy a boat so that they can live in the sea while the rest of the world stays out of harm's way, because the blast induced from Charles' seizure has already caused disastrous collateral damage to those in the vicinity, but the advent of a Mexican nurse Gabriela (Rodriguez) and her so-called teenager daughter Laura (a commendable debutante Keen) will eventually sabotage his plan. It turns out, Laura is very much like Logan, she is a man- made mutant using Logan's own DNA by Doctor Rice (E. Grant), who takes a vocation to capitalize on mutation to manufacture killing machines, Laura is one of his experiments, but now, along with other mutant children, they are failed guinea pigs needs to be disposed of, since Rice has something much more advanced created. So, reluctantly, Logan embarks on his final adventure to escort Laura (along with Charles) to the meeting place, then with other escapees, to cross the border into Canada, where Eden, a mutant paradise purportedly exists (the metaphor of breaking away from USA today is right on the nose), at the meantime, they are hunted by the Reavers, led by Donald Pierce (Holbrook, manage to pull off a clich\u00e9d role with verve and bemusing ambiguity), a huge fan of Wolverine's legend but also ruthlessly committed to his mission, but he is not the biggest problem for the fleeing trio.\n\nIncredibly, Mangold thrusts a brilliant human touch into the story arc, not the least is the moving Western nostalgia eliciting from George Steven's SHANE (1953) and that soul-stirring denouement when Logan is again, regretfully, embroils an innocent family into his war; yet keeps the action sequences snappy, utilitarian but uncompromisingly lethal, that introduction set piece of Laura's destructive nature and combatting prowess is such a godsend. Hugh Jackman will be forever beloved for this role, which he has been playing for 17 years, and here he is even more manifestly touching in ramming home Logan's cursed kismet with unrelenting taedium vitae, which is countervailed by Keen's perfect embodiment of innocence and dispassionateness, slowly eroded when a father-daughter bond starts to burgeon, effectively reaches its crescendo in the coda where a sort of patricide passes on the baton to the offspring. Patrick Stewart, meantime, is equally poignant appearing for the last time as the aging Professor X, his valediction is every bit as potent as Logan's.\n\nAlso worth mentioning that there is also a noir-version of the film, which is entirely in Black-and- White and makes great play of the story's tragic/heroic tone, when all is said and done, LOGAN is another triumph of comic material's R-rated transmutation (after DEADPOOL of course) on the big screen, but in its core, it is an ardently past-honoring action-er doesn't shirk from the grim fate but also sows its seeds of hope with great dexterity, to a point that we won't even begrudge to bid farewell to our favorite screen heroes, distinguished by their superpower but permanently scourged by its distasteful corollaries."

It portrayed the life struggles of the Wolverine (Logan) and Professor X that I can connect with and able to understand their pain that they had to go through as the last remaining mutants in the world. The action scenes were violent, realistic, and graphically detailed unlike the previous PRE-2011 X- men movies which were more suitable for younger audiences. To me, this should be the standard of most X-men/ Wolverine movies one that portrays real-life struggle, pain, emotional hardship, mental suffering, and graphic death scenes. I also like how they use classic X-men comics to demonstrate the differences of real world X-men and fictional figures. A very good closure for both Professor X and Wolverine."

The script is weak and unfortunately dumbed down and needlessly mindlessly violent. Without ruining the film... you're going to ask yourself why the young girl doesn't talk. Cheap, exploitative tricks like this and a really rushed, dumb ending (because we need the same Kodak moment in every film) make this a pretty boring, droll drag of a film that is camouflaged in a deeper \"so this is what happens when X-Men get old!\" There was nothing deep about it.\n\nThe lazy script leaves open gaping holes but I won't repeat them as a spoiler. Just be prepared to realize that this is a much lesser film than is being lauded here. People feel they must praise Jackman's departure as well as Stewart. If it wasn't for their excellent acting, this film would have gone quickly to cable.\n\nNotable are excellent special effects. I give them credit for seamless visuals. But the violence in this film was gratuitous and stupid, running into the face of danger like Superman. And at the end, after hearing all of this \"we perfected it\" rubbish, you'll have to wonder why the movie resembles Highlander. There can only be one. Really? Why is that?\n\nDon't kid yourself.

No new mutant has been birthed for 25 years and Wolvie lives with the Alzheimer's-suffering Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and the albino mutant-tracking Caliban (Stephen Merchant) in an abandoned smelting plant across the border. After a mysterious new mutant girl enters the picture (Dafne Keen), Logan, Xavier and the lass flee for possible sanctuary in North Dakota hounded by a malevolent security team from the dubious corporation in which the girl originated. Donald Pierce plays the arrogant cybernetics-enhanced chief of security.\n\nThis is the third and arguably the best Wolverine movie, although I slightly prefer 2009's underrated \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\" (2013's \"Wolverine\" was okay, but overall meh). \"Logan\" focuses on aging & death contrasted by new birth and the potential thereof. For a superhero flick, it's gritty realistic with compelling drama & characters and an entertaining road trip, not to mention loads of hard R-rated violence. The movie explores the possibilities of what would happen when high-powered mutants become aged and diseased.\n\nSome of classic Marvel Comics' best moments were when one of their superheroes, e.g. The Thing or The Black Panther, was thrust into an everyday scenario, like talking to regular folks on the street or shopping at the market. There's a lot of this in \"Logan.\" It dares to slow things down and focus on the characters and is the better for it. One of the best extended sequences is the trio's meeting with a hospitable black family (Eriq La Salle, Elise Neal & Quincy Fouse) after a highway mishap somewhere north of Oklahoma City. This episode is Exhibit A in why \"superheroes\" can't mix with regular folk for too long, for their own welfare.\n\n\"Logan\" ranks with the best superhero movies because, like 2009's \"Watchmen,\" it dares to be different. It's anything BUT a conventional superhero flick. Unfortunately, it's overlong at 141 minutes. The movie should've ended shortly after the trio's arrival to their destination, with some kind of potent dramatic close. But the filmmakers insisted on tacking on yet ANOTHER action-packed attack by the antagonists and it therefore ends on a tedious, redundant note. Disregarding this caveat, \"Logan\" is a great 'superhero' flick.\n\nMy favorite mutant, by the way, is the chubby black boy.\n\nThe film was shot in Rio Rancho, New Mexico; Newhall, California; and Pauls Valley & Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The screenplay was written by director Mangold, Scott Frank & Michael Green.\n\nGRADE: A-"

Meaning he intends this to be his final time playing that part. And plus he is caring for a weak and humble Patrick Stewart. So I was already invested and a bit emotional going in because I got sad seeing these two characters in this state. These are people I care for and I feel like I know them at this point. There's been so many films with them and it all lead up to this moment. I wasn't sure if I was ready for it, but I went in and... It exceeded my expectations. I loved it. I'm not gonna spoil anything because I think you should see. I don't even know what to write really, I'm really speechless.\n\nThis is a film that dares to go the extra mile and I applaud them for making an honest humble story and not this big extravaganza. Here the story and characters come first before all the action. Which I gotta say, The action was fantastic. It's extremely brutal and violent. Patrick Stewart gives a heartbreaking performance that's full of range. He is funny, crazy and wise. You feel really bad for him and seeing him be happy and remind Logan of the good values in life really got me. Hugh Jackman is phenomenal. This is \"THE\" performance from him.\n\nIt's a tragic movie too. A lot of scenes actually made me teary eyed. There's so much in this that broke me that I'm still unable to shake the emotions off. This film is something special. I will say that this is the first time I've seen an entire audience stay until the credits ended. Why you ask? Well, because everyone was waiting for a Post-credit scene. There is no extra scene at the end, so you don't have to wait. Some guys started booing because there was nothing extra. I usually stay for the credits, but I don't think this movie needed an extra scene. It's perfect as it is. One negative I can find is that villain was stock. There's not much to him.\n\nThat's it for now. I could talk about this film for hours, but I would have to go into Spoiler territory. My overall thoughts are that I think it's phenomenally exciting and heartbreaking. Go watch it."

However, as previously stated, most of these roles were either before my time. Never did I expect to see the emergence of an unknown Australian stage actor that I would grow up with for the next 17 years over the course of 9 movies, 3 Spidermen, 2 Batmen, 2 Supermen, and 2 Hulks. Hugh Jackman has embodied the Wolverine character in a way that has changed the way people perceive the the comic book counterpart. Whether its his image, voice, personality, or any other trait, Jackman has become inseparable from the Wolverine character. A feat that I am really overjoyed to have experienced growing up, and was genuinely sad to let go heading into this movie.\n\nAnyway with that out the way, the movie itself is an absolute masterpiece. It not only provides the most accurate incarnation of Logan, but also takes the time to explore a broken side of Charles Xavier we've never seen. Then finishes with the introduction of X-23 who has the strong potential to be just as popular as her father.The introduction, interaction, and insight into these characters proves to be the strongest element of this film. The relationship between Logan and Xavier developed over the course of the past 16 movies finally has its payoff as every scene packs the emotional weight that hasn't been experienced in a superhero movie yet.These relationships then help in the introduction and explanation of Laura.\n\nIn discussing breakout movie roles for actors and actresses, Dafne Keen may quickly find herself on that list. Portraying a mutant is already difficult enough, but not having any dialogue for the first half of the film while also playing the daughter of the Wolverine, its a tough task for even the most \"expert\" actors. This girl handles her role with such skill that allows her to stand out in a scene with Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman. That's without even mentioning her brutality once the claws come out!!\n\nI could go on and on about these characters, performances, and I haven't even gotten to the action yet, but no movie is without its flaws. Logan primarily struggles with its villains their motivations. Both villains while given an ample amount of attention, don't really shine essentially due to their vague and simple motivations.This is however combated by the presence of a lethal threat which provides a nice twist that was entirely unexpected.\n\nSo this is it. James Mangold, 20th Century Fox, and Hugh Jackman save their best for last with an all-time great movie that once again transcends the \"superhero\" genre. This classification will unfortunately immediately cause many to compare it to the Dark Knight which has and will always reign king among this newly found category of superhero movies. While I would stray away from making these comparisons myself, I will state that Logan does a number of better than this seemingly untouchable movie. It truly is a near perfect film to end Hugh Jackman's on-screen portrayal of an all- time great comic book hero, James/Logan Howlett AKA Weapon X AKA The Wolverine."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is definitely a movie whose high scores and positive comments are unreasonable. At the center of the film is the blossoming father-daughter relationship between Logan and Laura, but the film fails to convey this. It falls very short in making one feel a deep relationship between them. The problem has nothing to do with Keen and Jackson's acting. Dafne Keen did justice to the role, even though it was an adult film with a high dose of violence. Even though the script is a road story and such stories are very suitable to tell about the developing friendship and care, they could not put it on a proper basis and flow in the movie. I think one of the reasons for this is that they crowd the screen and the plot with other subjects, distracting the focus of the character of Laura. Maybe if this didn't happen, we could focus on developing our main characters' relationship better by making it feel natural.\n\nAlso, the end of this children's story arc is an ending that would suit a shounen anime or cartoon rather than an adult movie. It's like the producers weren't sure what kind of movie they were making. If it weren't for the other subjects, the film might have had a more complete style."

A young girl comes to their door with a group of threatening people looking for her, thus beginning Logan's attempt to help her escape.\n\nAs this is Hugh Jackman's last portrayal of Logan AKA Wolverine, it had high stakes. Personally I didn't expect this level of quality from it, considering how most of these big blockbusters tend to go in the direction of lackluster.\n\nLogan is a heavy movie. It is fantastically performed by both Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart, and the emotion they are able to infuse within the audience is more powerful than anything I've seen in the series thus far. The content itself is hard-hitting, thanks to a fantastic script, and as a whole this proves to be a huge step in an entirely different direction for the franchise. And that's a good thing.\n\nThe R rating allows the movie to reach this level of heaviness, and with that weight comes some pretty awesome, but brutal, violence. Despite the warnings I received about how brutal the introduction alone was, I still managed to be surprised by it. The movie doesn't hold back, but it doesn't overdo it either. It's just right, and just right is exactly where I wanted it to be.\n\nThe movie does a fantastic job of building atmosphere. It's dark, it's gritty, and it really feels like the end of the world. And in the context of the movie, I'm pretty sure that was the case.\n\nOverall Logan is a fantastic end to an already good series, and proves to be the best of that series, at least in my eyes. It's dark and gritty, but also well-acted, well-written, and never overdone. I can't wait to see this one again when it leaves theaters, and in the end I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Weapon X, one of the most beloved characters that Marvel has brought to cinema screens, has departed, but he has made it in style, with scarlet blood dripping down his defective adamantium claws and leaving a feasible regeneration based on young mutants in the bequest. After insistent and suggestive promises of director James Mangold, which were disclosed while he filmed the notorious movie, \"Logan\" has finally landed in worldwide cinemas and we have had the opportunity to refute or asseverate whether or not the words of the scholar Marvel-fan were right. In general terms, the utopian western that Mangold has raised is the definitive entry point to out-of-the- ordinary facets in the genre, for the true meaning of adapting works with abidance. This installment will cause us to apply Plato's Allegory of the Cave to UCM in all its splendor, dusting off the glorious, intelligent, capable and above all human superhero movies.\n\nJackman shows us his alter ego drastically unrecognizable: ill, faint and about to collapse. Australian actor gives everything in order to offer a proper last goodbye his professional epithet, he provides it tangible malady and visible fatigue along capacities, his sad gaze captures hopelessness; this man's actions will annoy to ethical heroes world and yes, what Mangold declared has a voracious source: \"It's not a superhero movie, it's a film about humans with powers\". Hugh offers a properly successor, she is Dafne Keen, newcomer actress who plays Laura, an overfilled with anger and vigor girl, with the potential required to carry upon her shoulder weapon X responsibilities. The dialogs for young actress are quasi-non-existent till the third act of the film, supplementing that phonetic absence by formidable physical skills within magnetic and violent action scenes; she's the precise.\n\nWolverine's last adventure as an irrevocable spaghetti western is unthinkable, a feature-film with a dirty and stylized artistic expression and seemingly devoid of moral characters, rough and badass guys. Here, the action sequences are justified, calculated and incredibly ferocious. Officially, this is the movie adapting Wolvie's pages in form and essence, it doesn't display super bright battles or with light sparks instead of blood, violence has a reason and aftermaths; and although the application is concise, they stir more than Avengers' pompous fights. The signs of summer movie are almost microscopic; the pictures are dry, pessimistic, melancholic and without a doubt, selected components can be compared with \"Midnight Special\" by Jeff Nichols. All this lack of hope is embellished with a sudden parsimonious pace, aggressive when it has to be, but intelligent in emotions posed. Marco Beltrami's music squeezes every means at its disposal, however, paradoxically, calm and sad melodies excel, they capture the atmosphere of the film.\n\nAnd emotional field matters. Sentimentality is suitable in each character, sensations are plausible and touch even the most disheartened person. It differs from sporadic determinations, incomprehensible twists, every act is motivated by a thought supported by feelings. As it's becoming a road/buddy movie, interpersonal relationships are improving and wins a brilliantly tremendous connection. Each of these mutant beings has a well-crafted conclusion, both expected and completely unpredictable endings. In fact, there's something sad about the movie: this one feels like by far the best Wolvie's story, making us reflect how other adventures would have been without MPAA restrictions. Must \"Logan\" thank \"Deadpool\"? It's all in how you look at it, since even though Wade Wilson's feature film has explicit contents, everything tends to the wit, while nuance is different here, and exactly that's what disquieted 20th Century Fox, the change has an abrupt alteration in pace with respect to the preceding film, however, they can breathe easier now, money continues coming in.\n\nUnfortunately, \"Logan\" must not be perfect thanks to the long- standing quandary which Marvel hasn't been able to keep down: antagonists. Year after year, movie after movie, despicable villains have to be as fundamental as setting or leading roles, they are a key piece in the puzzle, nonetheless, \"Logan\" re-inserted its reluctant hands in the painful ulcer. Perhaps, the screenwriters and director wanted the star trio was the absolute center of attention, embedding in the bad-guy role to Pierce (Boyd Holbrook), who doesn't appear the time requested on the screen, a few Mexican police officers and one or two human demons. Another point which many people have reviled is its \"extensive\" length, when a film with fascinating components is long?\n\n\"Logan\" says goodbye categorically to Bryan Singer's and Mangold's adaptations and takes delighted Christopher Nolan's \"The Dark Knight\" trilogy aura thanks to its realistic and pessimistic way, a desolate horizon where the hero isn't super, is a hero facing human issues. The second R-rated Marvel film cements ambitions in the tone, script and performances, portraying fully both the fictional world of the pages as the mortal world, our world which can transmute in the twinkling of an eye, there's a dry and overwhelming realism to our uncertain evolution. A violent, clever and eloquent motion picture; Jackman's final performance gives an unprecedented Wolverine impression so far and offers an open-minded look at the superhero universe, also serves as confirmation that Marvel can get to be as melodramatic and dark as DC films without losing the skills, without losing the touch. A round of applause for Hugh Jackman, who says \"never again\" to Wolvie's suit, however, economic Hollywood can get it. Thank you for everything and good way. X"

        "review_detailed_main": "After 17 Years debuting in the X-men Franchise, Hugh Jackman exits the role as Wolverine, a troubled loner with a heart of gold and claws of Adamantium.\n\nIn the future of 2029, Mutants have almost become extinct. Logan, living with a dementia ridden Professor Xavier and a mutant recluse named Caliban, turns his back on mutant kind, instead attempting to make a living as a limousine driver to retire to the ocean. However, Logan's fate is changed when she meets a young girl with mutant powers very similar to his own.\n\nThe Live Action X-Men franchise has often been accused of being disrespectful to the source material (or rather the more fantastical elements of said source material such as the Dinosaurs in present day of the Savage Land or the space opera adventures of the Starjammers), in an age where Marvel Studios explores space with Guardians of the Galaxy or the microscopic world with Ant-Man.\n\nIn Logan, that grounded reality works to the benefit of movie. Instead of visual spectacle and technicolor explosions, the action grim, grounded and folded to reality. Unlike other attempts to 'mature' the genre through simple additions of profanity and violence, Logan uses its R rating to tell a more character driven story, showing broken old men at the end of their ropes. After years of a PG-13 rating, the R rating doesn't simply add blood and gore, but a sense of melancholy and bleakness other films of the same genre do not have.\n\nLogan has been described as the mainstream Superhero Western, a fair comparison since Superheroes have often been compared to the Western Boom of the 50's while scenes of 1953's Shane plays during a scene.\n\nThe actors are fully giving it their all in this picture. Hugh Jackman has always had incredible range as an actor, but his turn as Wolverine is the thing that made him a star. It's only with an actor of his caliber and the age of playing the role for so long that you can get a performance of this magnitude with the emotional weight it deserves. Just the same, the usually reserved Patrick Stewart completely subverts his role as the kindly understanding Professor Xavier to a rambling, cynical cranky old man with a form of Alzheimer's. But, Dafne Keen will ultimately come out as the highlight of the film. It's hard to get children actors to put out a role of this magnitude but Keen's Laura manages to be both convincing as a child who's exploring the world for the first time and a violent killer in other scenes.\n\nThe action set pieces are astounding. The fight choreography is stable, the edits manage to feel coherent and the amount of chopped limbs, be-headings and spilled blood makes for a gory good time.\n\nIt's unclear where the X-men Franchise can go from here. After the critical disappointment of X-Men: Apocalypse but the financial success of Deadpool, fans have been counting the days when 20th Century Fox will sell the film rights back to Marvel Studios so the Mutants can become part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But, for the payoff we received at the end, Logan is worth the 17 years worth of X-Men films (Some Good, Some Bad, Most Mediocre) to see two actors have one last ride in what was some of the iconic roles in Superhero film history.\n\nSee it!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Ever since the first trailer with Johnny Cash's 'Hurt' in the background was released, Logan looked special. From the locale, cinematography, and Hugh Jackman's performance, Logan is a radical departure from what we have seen in previous X-Men films.\n\nPart of what I enjoyed about Logan was its smaller scope and more personable nature in relation to its narrative and characters. This is not a film about the action or the 'end of the world' narrative that we are so used to seeing in the genre. When we are first introduced to Logan, he is an alcoholic and devoid of any hope. His healing factor isn't working as well as it once was and the scars from his battles do not fade away like they once used to. Whilst working as a chauffeur during the night, he looks after a now helpless, Professor X in his desolate home. Xavier battles with Alzheimer's disease but also his own powers, which have unwillingly turned him into the most powerful weapon to exist. There is a rather interesting backstory regarding Xavier in the film. The characters are a far cry from previous portrayals. For instance, they are more vulgar as the film is Rated R. It was slightly odd to hear Xavier swear, but the swearing is not for the sake of giving the film its rating, but moreover to relate to its darker, gloomy tone. The introduction of Laura, played by newcomer Dafne Keen, becomes a catalyst in the narrative going forward. From the trailers, it was made clear that she is in fact X-23, a mutant who shares the same genes as Wolverine. Their relationship is beautifully conceived and leads to some great character development. Laura is brutal and feral, yet at the same time rather cute. That's quite a lethal combination! As a character, Laura is hard not to like, through her childish innocence, but also her dark history, which is one aspect of the film that helps give reason to the Rated-R.\n\nAnother aspect of the film I really enjoyed was its cinematography. Being set in New Mexico gave the film a warm, orange tint in the desert scenes that helped the film to look gorgeous. Aesthetically it helps to make Logan feel like an indie film. The camera work was thoughtful, particularly during the slower scenes, less so in the action. To elaborate, the camera work and slow paced nature of the film allowed me to connect with the characters. The action scenes worked in the sense that they really demonstrated the strength and brutality of the characters. Director James Mangold doesn't hold back and I loved it.\n\nMarco Beltrami's score is not overly emphatic but it helps connote the right emotion given the scenes. It too is a departure from the often dramatic scores of many superhero films and is instead more humble and soft.\n\nPart of why this film works is because we have seen Wolverine and Xavier's evolution as characters over the past 17 years and as such have an attachment to them. Their acts in this film will shock and surprise you. Hugh Jackman's self-professed final performance as the character is his best yet. He takes the character in directions we have yet to see him, as a father figure for example. Logan is truly a beautiful send off to a character who become a pivotal part of the franchise and its previous success."

I did what any reasonable person did and got into filmmaking myself. I was 14-15 back then and I'm still doing it. I know this was all about me and don't know that would I like it if I watch it today but if this movie made me want to do movies myself, I think its really successful."

        "review_detailed_main": "Barely even a superhero film, Logan elevates the genre to new heights by stripping down the character to its essentials and presents them in a powerful and emotionally moving tale about a worn-out man who has to find the hero who existed within him before.\n\nLogan has incredible direction. The standout is the R-rated action. All the gore and blood is utilized to visceral effect as the audience is carried from scene to scene following the characters. The western style and overtone of nihilism is perfectly captured by the barrenness and roughness of the production design. The score is a mix of melodies and orchestra capturing the essence of the moments and themes of the film.\n\nCharacter interactions are at the center of the film. The development of the characters are presented through subtle and emotionally resonant dialogue. The minimal dialogue draws the audience to the incredible and moving performances of the cast. Hugh Jackman fully embodies the worn-out hero who lives just to survive and has lost his sense of heroism or purpose of living. His performance draws us into his broken down world where little hope exists. Patrick Stewart, as Professor X, plays the opposite character with lively optimism and enduring hope. Laura, played by Dafne Keen, is the symbol of hope in the film and the vehicle through which Logan changes as a character. Boyd Holbrook, as Donald Pierce, plays the unrelenting villain who chases the protagonists and drives the plot of the film.\n\nLogan is not without its message. The film is a critique of unethical human experimentation and it hammers the point that it is more evil when done for the purposes of profit and power. X-Men related characters were created to highlight minority issues and the film is the best adaption of that purpose. It is also about the majority-minority power struggle and how each side acts and reacts against the other.\n\nSuperhero films as an artform are rare, Logan is one of them.\n\n10/10"

This was, without a doubt, the most perfect night I've had in a very long time... and I don't deserve it, do I?\n\nI don't know if it's just me but I love movies with a conclusion. I'm all for huge sprawling storylines but I like the ending. You always want more but at some point it all has to end. Logan does this perfectly. We see Logan who is old now, his body deteriorating and his mutant powers failing on him slowly. He's an alcoholic and he just wants to die. He has nothing to fight for anymore except Charles. Who is now borderline senile and has seizures that are capable of paralyzingly and killing all those around him.\n\nLogan is beaten down and although he still has fight left in him he knows his end is coming. He soon meets X-23 or Laura. A mutant who has powers like him. The film follows them as Logan tries to bring Laura to Eden, a place that she can be safe. You start off and you don't really care for Laura but by the end the relationship between Logan and Laura is heartfelt touching and sweet.\n\nThis movie is brutal. I truly mean it. I like how now studios aren't scared to make a movie a hard R. This movie is brutal and violent and it feels like the wolverine movie we've needed for a long time. Hugh Jackman does a brilliant job as always. The conclusions to Logan's storyline feels fleshed out and real. Not like they just threw it all together. It feels real and like any amazing movie should make you feel.\n\nI saw this a year or so ago and coming back to it now was so much more powerful. I can't say a whole lot because I don't want to give spoilers but this movie is depressing. Really Depressing. If you go into this expecting a fun Quicksilver time in a bottle type movie you're mistaken. This movie is brutal raw and real and keeps with the racism theme of the other X-Men films but puts it to the side a bit to focus on Logan and I'm honestly fine with that.\n\nThe \"villain\" is basically in my opinion just in there to drive the plot forward. This is a character driven movie through and through about a man with nothing to live for just waiting to die who is suddenly thrust back into his old life and has to deal with the death and destruction that follows him.\n\nIt takes a bit to pick up but once it does it's brilliant. This is the best X-Men film I've seen and a spectacular one all around. Please see this if you're ready to get your heart strings pulled on. Maybe have a cry and a bittersweet smile about the future."

People say it's the best standalone X-men film, but in reality it is the culmination of the others. The wanton killing, abuse of the manipulation of time, and repeated ignoring of a reasonable course of action has indeed freed the world from cataclysmic disaster, but has not given Logan more power. It's taken his toll, and now he dodders around, struggling to support a senile old man and save one little girl. It's not fanfare and parades that hail the return of wolverine but a failing liver and many unintentional naps. It makes so much sense, and it gives the film significance. Logan has little new to offer in terms of traditional action films. But as a revolutionary take on the genre and an emotional exploration of Logan and Professor X, it truly is an incredible film."

Some early scenes with Logan and Charles have some great writing\n\nCons\n\nNone!\n\nOverall, I thought 'Logan' was sensational and for me it is easily the best Wolverine film and if we could compare it to the X-Men films, then I would also put 'Logan' at the top of that list. Yes, it's a film that oozes emotion out of the audience and your meant to feel that way, but I will certainly be watching this over and over again. Great performances by all and there's really not much to dislike about this.\n\nQuote - \"Nature made me a freak. Man made me a weapon. And God made it last too long.\"\n\nRating - 10/10"

Many of these things our hero Wolvie has had to deal with throughout his long life but the aging and health issues are all new for him. In the past he never really had a family or loved ones but the X-Men became his family and he began to care and love. Now, mostly on his own, in pain, the loss and loneliness is kicking in and in many ways he can see the real curse of his once non ageing and healing powers. It's sad at times, often fun and joyous and also incredibly violent. The violence set the tone for what is now becoming a genre of its own, the adult superhero movie. Refreshing in so many ways. Hugh and Wolvie, I will miss you."

        "review_detailed_main": "So even though I have watched The New Mutants, I still have a few X-Men films left to watch and the next one is the film Logan and here is my review for it. The premise of the film is set in the future and sees an older Wolverine looking after Charles Xavier when a young mutant comes into their lives and force them on the run.\n\nMain Character Hugh Jackman has become famous for playing the role of Logan/Wolverine and in his final appearance in the role he gives his best performance to date. The fact he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for his performance here was an injustice as he truly deserved it for a mammoth truly emotional performance. We see a Logan worn down and fed up of life, he struggles throughout the movie and it really feels like the world has caught up with him and he is actually in danger, which has been something X-Men films have struggled with. Also this film having a more mature adult feeling means we finally get to see Jackman go full berserker Wolverine and it is fabulous and absolutely brutal.\n\nSupporting Characters Sir Patrick Stewart is back one last time as Charles Xavier and similar to Jackman he is brilliant here. The father figure and strong character is gone, replaced with a weak and damaged man that has gone through a lot. The dynamic between Charles and Logan is fascinating here, as it really feels like the roles have reversed and that Logan has to look after Charles which is great to see. Dafne Keen makes her film debut as X-23 and she is fantastic, she has hardly any dialogue but you can't help but care about her and I really bought into her relationship with Logan and where it grows. The dynamic between these characters is really the thing that carries the movie and you really care about these characters and it really drives this movie. Stephen Merchant, Boyd Holbrook and Richard E Grant also all do good jobs in their smaller roles here.\n\nStory Now even though this film has characters from the X-Men universe, this couldn't be further away from an X-Men film. It really focuses on the characters and the damage that has occurred to them over their lives and why they need to go on living for this young girl. As I mentioned above, the relationships between the characters and the friendship is what gives this movie weight and plenty of heart. It is a tragic story but a really well told one that fits the characters perfectly.\n\nScript The script is really great, this world is so gritty and there is drama galore. The more mature writing fits the film perfectly and really shows where the characters are, especially Xavier when you consider what he has been like in the previous films. There are also little drops of humour too which is nice to see and ensures Wolverine still has those moments even if they aren't always meant to be funny.\n\nStyle The style is brilliant, this world they created for the film fits so well, it is dark, dirty and gritty and it really feels like the end of days for the mutants. The R rating for this film was the right choice, the action is brutal and violent and it adds to this films story and the way it is presented. It is such an emotional ride that is paced really well and keeps you interested throughout.\n\nOverall Overall, this is a brilliant film, whether you are an X-Men, Wolverine or just film fan then you owe it to yourself to watch this movie. It is an emotional roller coaster and by focusing on it's character give a story and journey that you won't forget.\n\nRating - 10/10."

Mr. Mangold has nailed the character and the action, and Hugh Jackman is truly a part of a Wolverine movie that has showcased the true character that the fans had hoped to see full on. Yes, we've seen superb runs and flashes but nothing this deep or this epic.\n\nHow could any movie fan in general not just adore this film? It brought elements of a lot of great genres.\n\nLogan has to be considered genre-defining. The characters, action and story were all beyond outstanding in this movie. We are taken for a ride and can relate to Logan once again. The acting is superb and the dialogue is perfect for the level of each character. Every single character feels believable. You follow the story through Logan's eyes and what a ride it turns out to be.\n\nThis movie is emotional and moving in every single way that matters and is unique and is as far away from anything X-Men we've seen before. In this case, that's a very good thing. The fight scenes and pace are superb. I honestly could see Oscar nominations here on multiple fronts.\n\nThis movie is sophisticated and delivers a grand, tragic story. The action fits in nice but serves the story first. Unlike other \"dark\" films, the tone is perfect and fits the character. The supporting characters are utilized in a comprehensive and cohesive manner and are wonderful in and of themselves.\n\nI loved everything about this movie and they left it as if this was the perfect end to Hugh's run."

Logan is a grumpy old alcoholic with lethal tendencies who is soured by the horrors of his life. The story in this movie confirms that he has good reason to be this way. It was not my kind of comic book material. I only give it a 7 because it wasn't horrible as a movie. Just really over the top with swearing and horrific reality-based violence compared with other X- Men movies. I rate it less than other X-Men movies because the mutant powers are not shown as much as I think they could have been, other than the heavy use of claws. For example - Caliban was a pretty important character and I don't feel we really ever knew what his mutant power was. Certainly it wasn't just being sensitive to sunlight.\n\nOn a side note about Xavier. We saw him die in X-Men: The Last Stand. Then we saw him alive at the end of The Wolverine, at a time Logan was grieving dead Jean Grey. Logan looked surprised at Xavier's appearance but there was no explanation other than \"I have a few tricks up my sleeve\". I am wondering if this was explained in Days of Future Past and I just don't remember it. His death back in The Last Stand really hit hard and he was dead a good 7 years between movies, only to be alive up until the year 2029 and well, you will know when you see the movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is a Western. Let me get this out of the way first and foremost- I love westerns. I do not like westerns that remove the tropes, allegory, and character arcs from the setting of the old west and transpose it somewhere else. Perhaps that is just my opinion, but the setting is intrinsic to a large part of the narratives that westerns often use.\n\nDirector James Mangold clearly loves films like The Searchers, True Grit, A Fistful of Dollars, and Shane- Logan is rife with references. It telegraphs the plot, uses very obvious foreshadowing, and paints its obvious plot out for you. You know what's going to happen, in spite of how much you don't want it to. And I really didn't want it to.\n\nThis film has zero fun factor whatsoever. It's a hideously depressing film, one that doesn't celebrate the history of the character of Wolverine or use him in the comic-book context with which we are so accustomed. Instead, this hyper-realistic version of the universe has just about everything that could turn off someone looking to have fun. Perhaps brutal nihilism in the face of your own growing mortality is one person's idea of a good superhero movie. Not for me. This is Wolverine, not Neil Gaiman or Jhonen Vasquez creations.\n\nPerhaps this is why the film got such a great reception: it is not a prototypical superhero film. But it isn't a very ambitious film, either, just a film that plays with genre expectations in one specific way in order to completely copy elements of older films. Even the cinematography is lengthy, uninspired, and wholly traditional. Even the plot follows a rinse-repeat formula reminiscent of the Man with No Name films. The saving grace of the film stems from its obvious influences, because if you copy enough good movies you'll eventually make some good narrative choices. The plot isn't bad, it's derivative. The movie isn't poorly made, it's poorly conceived.\n\nI simply ask one thing of superhero and comic book films: Even if it is dark or r-rated, it still has to be entertaining. Logan is not. It;'s anti-fun, sucking energy from every person who views it. Logan has some fantastic performances and calls back to a lot of great old Westerns, but it's not a good superhero movie because it made me uncomfortably depressed, bored, and begrudgingly disappointed at how traditional, derivative, and copycat the movie is, and how much it utterly failed at being fun."

        "review_detailed_main": "The third and final Wolverine film following X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) and The Wolverine (2013), 'Logan' is the darkest & also THE most brutal X-Men film to date. Director James Mangold & Lead-Star Hugh Jackman returning for one last time as Logan/Wolverine, deliver a superhero film, that's Super in its truest sense. The one's an emotional, gruesome, gritty & powerful film, that holds your attention, despite excessive violence. Faint-Hearts please stay away, but those who relish Hardcore stuff, Grab A Ticket Now!\n\n'Logan' Synopsis: In the near future, a weary Logan cares for an ailing Professor X in a hide out on the Mexican border. But Logan's attempts to hide from the world and his legacy are up-ended when a young mutant arrives, being pursued by dark forces.\n\n'Logan' explores very less of Wolverine's journey, its all about Logan this time. 'Logan' is a character study of a superhero finally off his prime & facing enemies who are stronger than him. Even his life may end, for someone to whom immorality was certain. And that's exactly why 'Logan' works so hugely. The narrative is about Logan's constant fight to survive as well protect his mentor & a young mutant, who's on the run. The villains are ruthless & Logan's fight against them, is clap-worthy.\n\nThe Violence is too much though. I'm not complaining here, I mean a superhero with claws so sharp can't be projected with fake juicy blood, but the bloodshed here is rather disturbing. Whenever there is action up on screen, its brutal & unforgiving. The finale, particularly, is no-holds-barred. Don't tell me later I didn't warn you, dear faint-hearts!\n\nThe biggest triumph of 'Logan' is its emotional connect. Logan & the young mutant girl, share a wonderful relationship here, as does Profresser Xavier. The connect among them, despite all the brutality around, forms 'Logan' in its entirety. I was engrossed & even concerned about Logan & Co. here, I was connected with them & was rooting for them when they fought the evil-heads.\n\nScott Frank, James Mangold & Michael Green's Screenplay is intense & engaging. Its all-out brutality, with strong emotional undercurrents. The Writing, though predictable at times, is thoroughly arresting. Mangold's Direction is excellent. He's handled the film with authority. Cinematography & Editing are very good. Action-Sequences/Stunts are spectacular & pushes the 'R Rating' with force. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Graphics are top-class. Background Score & Make-Up, merit a special mention.\n\nPerformance-Wise: Hugh Jackman returns as Logan/ Wolverine for one last time & he's in terrific form. Right form his broken body-language, to the aggression he expresses when the claws are out & to the softness he emotes when building a connection with the little girl, Jackman brings fabulous layers to his portrayal. This is the best performance Jackman has delivered being Logan/Wolverine. Sir Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier/Professor X, is remarkable. The Screen Legend adds tremendous depth to the part & shines in every scene he appears in. Dafne Keen as Laura, is a surprise packet. She's electrifying! Boyd Holbrook as Donald Pierce, is menacing to the core. And is it ironic that the chief villain here is named Donald?? Elizabeth Rodriguez as Gabriella, does well in a brief role. Others lend good support.\n\nOn the whole, 'Logan' is Brutal & Brilliant! Two Thumbs Up!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The X-men might be the next step in human evolution, but until now, they were certainly not the next generation of superhero films. With the exception of Magneto, these mutants are a pretty forgettable bunch. They have a host of generic superpowers and equally unremarkable personalities. King of this bunch is the Wolverine. This character dominated the core franchise and spinoffs, ripping enemies to pieces in PG-13 glory. But even after a half a dozen movies this antihero never really grew beyond the loner among rejects persona. Honestly, the only character-centric scene I remember is a dialogue free montage of the immortal warrior fighting in American wars. I have seen enough movies that I know after the first twenty minutes rarely do things change for the better. By this standard, Logan (the 8th film featuring the Wolverine) is a miracle.\n\nLogan takes place in the near future were no mutants have been born for decades. With his race virtually extinct, Logan/Wolverine works as a limo driver earning enough to support Professor Xavier. Xavier is suffering a degenerative brain disorder and is further addled by medication. To keep civilians safe, Logan conceals his former mentor in an isolated Mexican dump. Logan is also seriously ill and detached from the world, so when he is contacted by a stranger who knows his identity he wants none of it. This woman wants Logan's help in escorting a child to an \"Eden\" in North Dakota. Wolverine grudgingly accepts for cash, but when he finds the woman dead he returns to Mexico and Xavier. However, the child stowaways and with a small army in hot pursuit, Logan is inescapably involved. This mute child is Laura, an experimental subject. She is a product of the Wolverine's DNA, effectively Logan's daughter and a mutant with similar powers. Obviously, the corporation that created Laura wants her back. After a close escape, Logan, Xavier, and Laura head to North Dakota in search of Eden.\n\nLogan is the conclusion of Jackman's Wolverine saga, equal parts superhero movie and contemporary western. Action sequences abound, but set to a background of dying old men driving across America's wastelands. One can sense director James Mangold's vision beyond the norm. His love for the genre has been expressed before in the 3:10 to Yuma remake. Here the approach works because of new vulnerability. Xavier is infirm and, like many elderly, he is stripped of dignity. His seizures and bouts of incomprehensibility recast the man, formally a paradigm of erudition and control. The classic wheelchair takes on brand new symbolism. When Xavier achieves moments of lucidity his reflections reach a profundity that was never matched in earlier films. Speaking of never before seen, this old man Logan. Even the fight sequences are not the same. With Wolverine's regenerative abilities hampered, finally bullets and beatings have consequences. The R rating also helps on this front. I could never quite ignore how a man could eviscerate enemies with metal claws without blood. Freddy Krueger must have been ashamed. But really this improved action is just an incidental upside. The mutants facing inevitable extinction is a scenario that allows for the character to thrive. The immortal veteran never fit comfortably in a boarding school for wayward children. A fight for survival where Logan has nobody to lean on is more reflective. Logan can finally assume the mantle as caretaker for what is left of his family. The best manifestation of this tough love is between Logan and pseudo father. It's shocking, watching Logan assist formerly omnipotent Xavier use the bathroom at a wayward gas station. Although less enthralling are scenes portraying a failed father and lost daughter. Logan has learned love, but he is used up, always drinking and practically coughing up a lung, finally beat. A classic western hero. There is a scene of Xavier and Laura watching the film Shane, but enthusiasts will recognize the tone and tropes without the direct reference. Hired hands, vast empty landscapes, the innocent family. The genre gives the film a familiar structure and ascetic core. Recognizable, but unlike any superhero movie before.\n\nUnfortunately, character and tone brake down in the final act. I don't know what I expected, maybe an operatic twenty minute standoff? The film finally devolves into the been there seen that, dashing a chance at greatness. It's not that the end is even particularly unsatisfying, just that by then expectations had been raised. Still the ride was worth it, and I even walked out the theater optimistic. Logan suggests the potential of these massive multi-movie universes. Usually squandered sure, but with any luck Logan's success will open doors for directors, writers, and actors with fresh takes. Let's hope Logan is not an evolutionary dead end in the superhero movie genre."

        "review_detailed_main": "Half-man, half-beast. A brooding, violent mass of rage who shreds to pieces anyone foolish enough to stand in his way. Isn't that what all of us Marvel fans envision when we hear the name Wolverine?\n\nI was a bit disappointed when I saw the trailer for Logan. The fierce anti hero we're familiar with is a shell of his former self. Suffering from pain and drudging through day-to-day life. Far from the short-tempered badass that characterizes Wolverine.\n\nI went to view Logan with low expectations and sense of loyalty. After all, Hugh Jackman is nearing 50 years of age. His hard work and determination to give us a final Wolverine performance is admirable (hopefully I can deadlift half the weight he does at his age).\n\nThe plot is set in 2029, with Logan making a living as an alcoholic limousine chauffeur - while doing his best to look after an ailing Professor X. The tone is dark, gritty and somber. Unsurprisingly, Logan's attempts to hide away from the world is botched when a young girl shows up in his life.\n\nThe movie starts off depressing and slow, but the pace ramps up quickly. Rage-fueled slashing and hacking? Delivered in spades. The action scenes are extremely violent and gory. The R-rating is well deserved.\n\nHugh Jackman gives his best performance to date. He portrays Wolverine's nuances and inner struggles flawlessly. Dafne Keen, who portrays the young mutant Laura, gives an amazing performance as well (looking forward to her future roles). And Patrick Stewart delivers an exceptional performance as Professor X.\n\nOverall, Logan blew away my expectations. As the credits rolled, I felt highly satisfied - and sad that Jackman's role of the character had come to an end. He reveals a vulnerable, humanistic side of Wolverine I'd never imagined - without omitting the ferocious, savage aspects we all know and love."

        "review_detailed_main": "In purely literal terms, Logan is a comic book movie. However, it's a significant departure from the standard comic book movie formula. It does not have a super-powerful threat intent on destroying the city/world/universe. It does not have a gigantic CGI battle sequence. It does not have a contrived romance subplot. It doesn't even depend on the audience having seen some number of previous films to understand the plot or character motivations. And it certainly wasn't made for the standard PG-13 audience. Instead, Logan plays out in way that could perhaps best be described as an extremely intense, violent, and emotional family road trip. And as strange as that may sound, it works almost perfectly.\n\nThe tone of the film is one of weariness and struggle; from very early on it is made clear that Logan and Professor Xavier are in hiding. The look of the characters and world itself both reflect this tone perfectly; Logan and Xavier both look like they've seen better days. Not long after the film begins, Logan becomes the begrudging guardian to a seemingly mute young girl, Laura, who is being hunted by dangerous people. What follows is a road trip across the country, punctuated by a mix of quiet, heartfelt moments and brutal, unforgiving clashes. The tension of being pursued is a constant driving force giving our characters' actions a sense of purpose, and keeping the audience engaged at all times.\n\nIf I were to note a flaw with this otherwise very strong story, it would be the abrupt introduction of a large number of characters towards the end of the film. They are mentioned previously, but they aren't really developed beyond the bare minimum. They weren't particularly necessary to the ending, and it is hard to care about them seeing as we barely know them. I couldn't help but find myself thinking that if they were written out of the story it would have been more focused overall.\n\nThat being said, the three main characters work perfectly together as a strange little family, and they are developed in such a way so as to not alienate viewers who have never seen any of the other X-Men movies. The villains are also threatening and scary throughout while still being completely believable, albeit fairly one-dimensional. The near-future world in which the events take place is also a very grounded and believable one instead of a monolithic comic book fantasy world. References to events in past films are also minimal, though they reward people for following this character through his various past adventures. The ending is incredibly satisfying.\n\nOverall, Logan is a highly compelling standalone film that can even entertain crowds that have no interest in comic books or the movies based on them. It is one of the rare comic book movies that transcends being great within the comic book genre to being simply great, period."

        "review_detailed_main": "This down-and-dirty 'X-Men' spin-off takes its cues from classic westerns, specifically 'Unforgiven', and presents a compelling and surprisingly emotional take on cinematic comic book characters who had started to feel somewhat worn out. Ironically, this final chapter of the old guard rejuvenates what had become a stale and predictable franchise.\n\nHugh Jackman reprises his animalistic icon and the role now fits him like a well-worn boxing glove, only this time he imbues Wolverine with such a sense of irreparable brokenness and emotional gravitas that it ranks as one of his finest performances to date. Patrick Stewart also shows us some of his best work as an ailing Charles Xavier, no longer the stable source of wisdom and serenity, but instead a fragile old man suffering through an illness of the mind that has robbed him of his dignity. If you strip away the fantasy then this is about two ageing men \u2013 one a fallen war hero turned washed-up alcoholic and the other a former community leader turned lonely, Alzheimer's-ridden geriatric. Together, Jackman and Stewart make for the most compelling and unexpectedly touching double act. They turn a comic book western into something of a fragile buddy movie cum pseudo father/son story and their chemistry makes the film work.\n\nThere are issues with 'Logan' that stop it from realising its full potential though. The first hour is almost without fault: it's affecting and tense, full of pain and anger and grit and snarl, punctuated by salty dialogue, soulful performances, and bloody, brutal action set-pieces that pull no punches. However, as we switch gears into the third act, things begin to fall back on formula, especially once we meet the 'big bad' of the piece and lose an old friend in the process. The film loses something as a story after that and devolves into more standard comic book action adventure fare, particularly with its woodland-set climax that looks closer in spirit to the ramped-up silliness of 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' than the dusty, dirty western-inspired imagery of the previous 100 minutes.\n\nBut I won't get too bogged down in the negative because there is much to celebrate here. This is really brilliant stuff, commendable for the risks it takes, more so because it is produced by a candy floss factory of blockbuster entertainment that usually assembly lines its products to be sweet and light. And there ain't no candy to be found with this flick. It's bloody, it's brutal and it's emotional. It's everything you could want from a mature comic book film really. 'Logan' engages with its key theme of growing old both in tender and tough ways, so much so that you forget you're watching an 'X-Men' film half of the time, while director James Mangold finally fulfils the promise he once showed (20 odd years ago no less) with his own magnum opus and neo-western 'Cop Land'. Even with my reservations about the last 30 mins, 'Logan' is still a magnificently made, uncompromising superhero film that has absolutely no interest in being a superhero film."

        "review_detailed_main": "Not since the first Iron Man have I left a superhero movie as satisfied as I was after seeing Logan. There are a few factors that pull this hero flick into an exclusive group of its own - and for good reason.\n\nIt may sound typical, but basic brutality and gore are what hero films have lacked in recent years. How many times can we watch an Avengers fight scene and feel a tad underwhelmed? Logan's intense and at sometimes dark violence makes you actually witness the pure epic slasher that the Wolverine is supposed to be. Time after time I found myself actually putting my hand over my mouth in pure awe during the fight sequences of this absolutely shocking take on the Wolverine.\n\nBut it isn't pure blood-soaking fight scenes that put this film over the hill. Logan in all actuality has a story, a good story - and in relation to most other superhero movies, a great story. Not once did I find myself waiting for the dialogue to end in order for the action to begin. This movie is the perfect action thriller that has a story that keeps you engaged until the very end.\n\nI only have a few minor complaints that keep this movie from earning a perfect score. I do not mind \"inappropriate\" language in movies; in fact I think that different examples of crude language can greatly add to the effect of a film. However, I think with Wolverine earning the \"R\" rating - they went a little over the top and in some moments were just lazy with dialogue. The other very minor thing, is I thought Dafne Keen was slightly annoying. In terms of child actors she was fine, but her repetitive screams and yells were irking.\n\nLogan is the closest thing I've seen to a perfect superhero movie in a long time. The characters are dynamic, the story inviting, and the action brutal. I couldn't have asked for more out of this film."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is my first review even though I have been a member here since late 90's early 2000s. This is due to the fact that I don't understand the love for this movie.\n\nThis movie stumbles about trying to figure out how to be a road trip movie with a western genre landscape and superhero theme. The result is a pretentious sloppy mess that takes itself too serious while giving very little regard to the films that led to this one.\n\nThe fans that requested an \"R\" rating did so with the thinking that it would open up the film to be more free with the character. Instead it felt like it was pigeon holed into justifying the R rating from the senseless breast flashing to random F-bombs that don't fit the characters as presented previously in the last 17 years.\n\nThe 2:21 run time seemed to drag past three hours as I felt a lack of empathy for any of the characters as they are not fully developed and flushed but rather used as props for beautiful shots against the desert and country roads of Mexico and rural America.\n\nLogan's disregard to the other characters in the film was forced and lacked any connection to the empathetic character we were introduced to in the original X-Men film in which we were introduced to a character that felt compelled to help Marie D'Ancanto after encountering her on the road. Logan, though he has tried to be a loner, never really was a loner without any empathy. That is until this movie and the motivation for this lack of empathy towards a little girl and her issues is troubling as a movie goer.\n\nI can not find a reason to recommend this movie or to see it again outside of the beautiful cinematography throughout the film."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's violent, it's very dark, and in the end it's notably depressing. But 'Logan' is also exciting, deeply engrossing, and ultimately unexpectedly fulfilling. And it's quite possibly the single best live-action superhero or comic book movie that has been made to date.\n\nThe genre was all but reinvented when the Marvel Cinematic Universe launched with the first Iron Man film in 2008, and the MCU has since largely defined the standard for comic book movies. That's a double-edged sword: Every new superhero blockbuster now has to have heroes that are as snarky and sarcastic as they are superhumanly powerful. There's room for humor that is more clever, and for deeply affecting drama, but above all superhero movies must have Action, Action, and more Action to draw in the box office numbers, and a tangled web of world-building to lead into the next projected number of films.\n\nIt can be enticing, but it also becomes tiresome after a certain point - we can only watch so many protagonists formed from the same mold before the pattern begins to wear thin. In 2017, 'Logan' struck a very different tone that's just one part of what makes it so great and, even now, more lastingly impressive.\n\nThe opening scene alone gives a peek at how violent and bloody the movie is going to be, and also imparts a bit about our protagonist before we even get the full picture. The man called Logan is no longer the powerhouse known as Wolverine. He's noticeably older, he's tired, and he doesn't bounce back from injuries so easily; the abilities he has relied on for many years are failing him. That's only the introduction for a narrative that becomes ever more dour alongside the setting: This is not your typical comic book movie.\n\nWhat follows is partly an examination of mortality, and the consequences of a hard-charging heroic lifestyle, as Logan tries to get by with odd jobs and care for a very ill Charles Xavier. No one else among their recognizable mutant allies, the X-Men, are around any more - it's just them. When Logan is tasked with protecting a young girl, life becomes significantly more difficult.\n\nHugh Jackman is an excellent actor, and for all the times he's portrayed Wolverine on film, none of them can begin to compare to this performance. Patrick Stewart, legend that he is, again turns heads in the role of the man once known as Professor X, but this time it's a much more frail, saddening depiction.\n\nThe rest of the cast is fine, but extra special commendations must go to young Dafne Keen, appearing in 'Logan' as the mysterious girl Laura. Keen was only 12 years old when this film premiered, but she lights up the screen and handily steals the spotlight away from the bigger names on the bill. The first time that Laura shows who she is, and bursts into action, Keen lets loose with a bombastic, feral rage that makes the scene absolutely electrifying, and almost a little startling for how very visceral it is. She shows more range as the picture goes on, especially at the finale, and impresses upon us right away that she is a talent to be reckoned with. One can only hope we get to see many more features with Keen in the future, because she is outstanding.\n\n'Logan' is exciting and suspenseful, but it's also a bit of a punishing watch. In following our aging protagonist, the film forces viewers to recognize their own mortality. For all his abilities, and all the things he has done, Logan is no longer the person he once was, and to continue to push himself to the same limits may actually break him. At the same time, the minor focus on Xavier complements that mirror by showing us a man who is losing himself, and losing control of his faculties - yet who is no less powerful, and therefore a danger to both himself and those around him. As much as 'Logan' is filled with action to satisfy fans of superhero movies, it is also highly suffused with sorrow, frustration, regret, and a hurt that runs deeper than the most grievous wound.\n\nAs heavy as the narrative is in its themes, we're still not done. The X-Men, as an intellectual property, has always been a thinly-veiled metaphor for the queer community, with substantial emphasis on the persecution, ostracism, and prejudice levied against people just because of who they are. The focus on these themes have perhaps lessened over time as attitudes in society have shifted. Yet as the means used to target lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, or otherwise queer folks have changed, story beats in the comics and movies have changed, too. 'Logan' doesn't shy away from the subtext as the narrative also includes mention of genetic engineering that echoes real world concerns: mapping the human genome means better understanding of the diversity of our species, but the knowledge also presents a danger of being used to alter people before they're even born.\n\nMany other superhero movies dabble in sociopolitical topics; 'Logan' bathes in them. Many other superhero movies give a passing glance at the human condition; 'Logan' is laser-focused on it. I repeat: This is not your typical comic book movie.\n\nIt's simply a bonus that 'Logan' stands on its own, independent of other films. One doesn't need to have seen other pictures featuring Wolverine to appreciate this one. One doesn't even need to have background on who the X-Men are to appreciate this, though it does help and adds significant context. As long as violence is no object, this is a movie that anyone could enjoy.\n\nMy interest in comic book films has waned considerably over time, and only periodically will one come around that truly piques my interest. 'Logan' falls into the genre thanks to its source material, but it refuses to follow the established formula; you will not find any shots here that accentuate the imposing heroic stature of the protagonist. The thrilling action is intense, but so is the arresting drama. 'Logan' is a superhero movie like no other, and I don't expect we'll see another like it any time soon.\n\nEssential viewing, for comic book fans and for general audiences alike. I don't want a glut of films copying what 'Logan' has done, but action blockbusters could definitely stand to learn a lot from this."

And as far as swan songs go, they could not have asked for a better film.\n\nIt's 2029 and mutants have become an endangered species. No new mutants have been born in years and only a few of the old guard are left. One of the few \"lucky\" survivors is Logan, who is radically removed from his glory days, being reduced to a suffering husk of his former self. And he has gotten off lightly compared to Charles Xavier, trust me. But then a new mutant enters their lives. A young girl with a power set almost identical to that of Wolverine's.\n\nJames Mangold is once again directing and he continues to show that he really gets the character. The Wolverine focused on Logan's past and the human behind the adamantium skeleton and the nigh immortality. Logan focuses on the mortality of the character. On the fact that all beings, even one such as Wolverine, must grow old. Must one day, no matter how far into the future, die.\n\nIn that light I'm almost hesitant to call this movie a superhero film. Because it's such a reconstruction of the genre that it's almost a new thing in and on itself. It borrows heavily from westerns and the rougher side of Americana, while also being a bittersweet love letter to all the previous X-Men films and to all superhero films in general. While also being a brilliant film in its own right.\n\nHere's to you Hugh Jackman. Here's to you Patrick Stewart. And here's to you James Mangold. This will not be the last superhero film. But it almost should be."

        "review_title": "\"As I live and breathe, the Wolverine.\"",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Logan\" is the final farewell to Hugh Jackman as the iconic X-Men superhero, Wolverine, who wouldn't be so iconic without his performance. Jackman hangs up the gloves in \"Logan\" and in a grisly fashion. \"Logan\" is everything we ever wanted in a Wolverine film, a hard R-rating with bloody violence and over excessive language. The film follows Logan as a limo driver trying to support himself and Charles Xavier as they live in an abandoned factory a couple of miles from the border to the U.S. in Mexico. One day a mutant girl (X- 23/Laura) finds her way into the lives of the two men as she is being chased down by the Reavers, led by Donald Pierce, and the man Pierce is working for Dr. Rice. Soon Logan and Charles are sucked into the situation and take it upon themselves to protect Laura by any means necessary and getting her to safety.\n\n\"Logan\" might be the most realistic and mature superhero film that has ever been made. It's really hard to categorize this film under the superhero genre because the film is so grounded. There are no big budget explosions or people wearing spandex suits, this is an in your face film about what happens to superheroes when they are no longer superheroes. Logan is a heavy drinker and is slowly losing his healing ability and his powers are slowly draining. Charles Xavier has violent seizures which cause tremors and has lost all hope in what he is and was. This is a very depressing film where there is no glimmer of hope in these characters, all hope is basically lost.\n\nThe opening scene of the film where Logan fights off these gangbangers trying to jack his limo is not only awesome and violent but very depressing. You see Logan struggling with his powers and getting his butt kicked around a lot, even though he comes out victorious there's no feeling of relief or success. The Wolverine we know and love is gone, he's not making sarcastic jokes, or buffing up his ego. All of that is gone and all that is left is a broken man.\n\nThe acting is spot on. Jackman and Stewart do their finest works in this film and Dafne Keen as Laura/X-23 was great, she is a very talented little girl. Boyd Holbrook as Pierce did a very good job, he was very cool and calm, and brought so much life to the character. Stephen Merchant as Caliban was so great in the film. You felt so much empathy for his character and it wouldn't have been the same without Merchant's performance and the fantastic writing and character development.\n\nThe film has a lot of action, blood, and gore. This is a very unconventional superhero film in that the action is very grounded there aren't any explosions and most of the action heavily relies on the hand to hand combat the characters face. The opening scene of the film just shows the grisly violence it has in store for us. It was just awesome to watch, I still have goosebumps thinking about it.\n\nJames Mangold returning to direct this film did such a fantastic job at it. He really created a Western drama disguised as a superhero film and it very much does feel like a Western. Mangold's vision for the film was spot on, it just shows how far gone the world is and the state the characters are in. Mangold directed the previous solo Wolverine film \"The Wolverine\" (2013) which I found to be quite underrated, Mangold did a good job with that film took what worked best about it and brought it to \"Logan\".\n\n\"Logan\" in my opinion is the best superhero film that has ever been made. It tackles so many themes in the superhero genre that haven't been touched upon or even noted and does it masterfully. Mangold's direction and Jackman's performance is what really brings this film together and in the end the best portrayal of the Wolverine."

        "review_detailed_main": "Logan is probably the most hyped X-Men film of all time and I promise you this film will not only meet your hype but downright break your expectations.This is a searing epilogue to the character of Wolverine and a swan song for Hugh Jackman after 17 years of playing this legendary role.Logan is not only in my opinion the best marvel superhero film ever,arguably this is the best superhero film ever as well.I know in terms of technical ability Dark Knight might just edge Logan out but in terms of enjoyment this is an experience that is yet to be matched by a superhero film.It's brutal and merciless and when I say say brutal and merciless I MEAN IT.I mean we all knew that it was a R-Rated film but nothing can prepare you for the hell that will unleash upon.I don't care what people will say but Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewert are Oscar worthy in this film.This is most probably the first film where Hugh Jackman was challenged as an actor to play Wolverine and sadly it's his last.After 17 years of playing this role he knew everything about the character like the back of his hand but in this movie he had to portrait a person not a hero.It was gritty,brutal and downright gut wrenching.And can we talk about X-23 now?BEST SIDE KICK EVER!!!!!In fact she is much more bad ass than Wolverine.Wolverine is very worn out in this film.We see that the world has taken it's toll on him so,he doesn't fight too often but when he does you'll feel sorry for the guy who's gonna fight him.But when Wolverine isn't using his claws to slice up wholesale meat it's X-23 who does it and HOLY Crap!It's brutal and Awesome.Dafne Keen plays the role of X-23 and before going into this film I was kind of skeptical cause she's a kid and we all know kids in Hollywood movies are always the weak link.Can someone just slap me now for thinking that?She knocks it out of the park.I don't know if she'll feature in any future X-men films or not but I'd give anything to see her in this role.Let's talk about the action,Probably the one of the best action film of the decade and not just because it utilizes it's R-Rating brilliantly,The fight sequences are genuinely well choreographed.It's absolutely insane. Is it a perfect film?No,it's not.Do I give one ounce of crap?No,I don't.It's the most fun I've had watching a superhero film and that's the only thing that matters."

I just put it on for background noise while I went around cleaning and cooking. But guess whose jaw slowly dropped when they looked up and guess who ended up giving up on cleaning about a few minutes in. *raises hand*\n\nI applaud the performance given by all the actors in this film and I'm extremely excited for any of Keene's future performances. That little girl is special and she's gonna blow the roof off of any role she ends up playing.\n\nEvery one of the actors took a piece of my heart and kept me invested in them, the character development and character dynamics were complex and real. Laura was pint-sized child that held all the fury and fists of a grown man, fiercely loyal and bloodthirsty. Professor X's ailing disease turned him bitter but at the root of him you still saw the compassion and caring professor that had always been around. And Wolverine, man, I applaud the performance of this character. Jackman really blew me away; Wolverine was so complex and riveting and I'm sad to say I don't have enough words to explain how amazing it was. I have to applaud the writers for this as well.\n\nThis was truly a masterpiece. It seems as if Hollywood is really getting it's act together. This film was unflinching raw; it grabs you by the throat and doesn't shy away from showing you it's dark world.\n\nI was in for one heck of a ride and I didn't even know it."

It had its comedy moments but not so much that it makes the film look less serious as this comes across as a serious film.\n\nIt just seemed like it was in a much higher league from all the other xmen/wolverine films.

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, if you're thinking this is just another typical X-Men or clich\u00e9 superhero movie ... You're seriously wrong. Of all the comic- book movies I've seen, I dare to say this is the one that I can finally call a goddamn DRAMA. Plus, this time it's rated R! Thank you Deadpool, I honestly hope that we'll have more films like this in the future.\n\nThe very first scene instantly transports us to a different tone that we're not used to seeing in this type of films. It's darker, gritty, bloody, gruesome, grisly, did I mention bloody? There are so many scenes that just stuck to my memory, I constantly jaw-dropped at almost every single action scene. AWESOME! Excellent direction by James Mangold, the quick cuts worried me at the beginning, but it's almost flawless. As for the action, this movie nails it and surpassed the already huge hype that it had. Best action from the whole  X-Men franchise.\n\nHugh Jackman ... It's an epic goodbye. As always, he's magnificent which I already expected before entering the theater. I mean, it's a character that he's been playing for almost 20 years, it's a routine that he knows from scratch, but this one is really the best from him.  A very different Logan and he nailed it perfectly. Patrick Stewart is great as always and this time he's even funnier than Hugh Jackman! However, the real surprise is Dafne Keen (Laura), who plays the extraordinary kid. She's able to connect with the audience without saying a SINGLE WORD until the beginning of the third act. Honestly, she reminded me of Millie Bobby Brown's powerful performance of Eleven on Stranger Things. She's that good. Marvel just keeps getting the casting right, again and again, every single time.\n\nI can't and I won't tell you much about the story. What I can say is that this is definitely the most emotional and captivated that I've ever been in an X-Men movie. The ending is as perfect as it can be and the movie is honestly more than I expected it to be. It surpassed the hype surrounding it and I can only congratulate James Mangold for the brilliant work.\n\nUnfortunately, the movie isn't perfect as a whole (none is) even if it has a lot of perfect action scenes and performances. The pacing drops to a slow-burn in the second act (the least great of the three ... still great, though) and, don't get me wrong, it is needed and it's well compensated later in the movie, but it still dragged on for a little too much. The villain worked for the plot, I don't have that many problems with him even if I did expect more from him. A few exposition scenes, in the beginning, explaining the origins and purpose of some important backstory nagged me a bit, I think they had the possibilities and means to achieve a better way to explain everything (as they did in some other situations throughout the film) without recurring to an iPhone video.\n\nAll of these are minor issues because Logan is f*cking AWESOME! The bloodiest X-Men movie ever, the best X-Men action scenes ever and the best Hugh Jackman in all of the franchise: this is the best film from the X-Men universe. An emotional DRAMA, with powerful performances from both main and supporting actors, a beautiful ending and an epic journey that now (supposedly) ends. Thank you, Hugh Jackman. You will not be forgotten!"

        "review_detailed_main": "If there was any film likely to leave me in tears this year in the cinema, it was going to be Logan. Hugh Jackman's swansong to the X- Men franchise and to the character of Wolverine he'd been playing for 17 years. Logan is a character I've been watching since I was 4 years old back in 2004, so in many ways it felt like the end of my childhood.\n\nThankfully, Logan is a film that has matured with it's audience that had been watching X-Men since their early years. It's a dark, miserable and depressing film and barely resembles a single superhero film of recent years. I'll also say seriously that this is the best superhero film since The Dark Knight, possibly even better.\n\nThis was a beautiful, powerful and violent send-off that worked far better than I ever possibly could have imagined. Hugh Jackman plays a far older, broken and worn down Wolverine whose healing powers don't work very well anymore and has to look after a dementia stricken Professor Xavier who is prone to dangerous psychological outbursts. Logan ends up reluctantly having to look after and take a clone of himself in the form of a young girl to sanctuary while being hunted by a military group.\n\nWhere Logan differs itself from other superhero films is its tone and content. While Deadpool was a violent and crude film, Logan is far more mature, resonate and powerful. This is not a kids film, not just due to the adult content, but the bleak and miserable tone throughout.\n\nIt's really sad to see these characters you grew up with in such a broken state. Logan is a borderline alcoholic reduced to being a limo driver, while Xavier is a shadow of his former self. It's heartbreaking stuff that works so well thanks to the incredible performances from Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart. They manage to mix superhero nonsense with genuine heart, warmth, tragedy and even comedy at times. It's all so bittersweet, but it works.\n\nThey're joined by a star making turn from Dafne Keen as 'Laura' a near mute clone of Logan who is on the run from a military group. While barely saying anything, Keen brings so much to the role, delivering a really touching father-daughter relationship Logan had been unable to have throughout his whole tragic life. What's even more impressive is the fact this is only Keen's second role in her entire career and she nearly stole the show from Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart. This is probably the best child performance I've seen since Chloe Grace Moretz in Kick-Ass.\n\nThe Office/Extras writer Stephen Merchant also gave a memorable turn as Caliban, a pale albino mutant who brings a lighter tone to some of Logan's more bleak outlook. He's essentially doing what he usually does, but with some makeup on. Anyway, it was nice to see him a huge blockbuster film for once. He earns it more than his co- writer Ricky Gervais. And now I just imagined an alternate universe where Gervais was in this too...\n\nJames Mangold takes on directorial duties as he did with the previous Wolverine outing 'The Wolverine' in 2013, which was great until it's third act, but still 1000x better than 2009's 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine'. Logan thankfully does not suffer from the same pitfalls as Mangold's last effort with the Wolverine character. Probably due to the fact he was allowed creative control to make a violent, R- rated send-off that lacks a bombastic CGI heavy finale.\n\nAll the action in Logan feels small and contained, but is brutal and hard-hitting at the same time. It was so satisfying to see Wolverine actually cut people up into gory messes. While extremely violent, it all works within the tone of the film. I wasn't a massive fan of the frequent swearing at the beginning of the film, but that soon wore off and they toned it down.\n\nMangold directs the action scenes with kinetic beauty, making use of both Wolverine and Laura in some visually beautiful action scenes. The cinematography of Logan feels closer to No Country for Old Men than it does a superhero film. Logan has the vibe of a neo-western and looks gorgeous, full of nice looking deserts and even a trip to Las Vegas.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, I'd honestly be okay if this was the ending to the X-Men series as a whole. It leaves things in such a powerful and perfect way that I was tearing up. While is the end of Hugh Jackman's run as Wolverine, it also feels like the end point of the X-Men we all grew up with, and it managed to do it all perfectly.\n\nLogan is a powerful, violent and beautiful send-off for Hugh Jackman's 17 year run as Logan. It's also one of the best superhero films of all-time and likely to be one of the best films of 2017. I really hope there's Oscar considerations for Logan for next years awards."

This is much more personal, emotional and brutally violent, strictly not for kids. After the 2 shitty solo Wolverine movies, this is not only one of the best X-men movies, but also one of the best superhero movies, almost at par with Batman: The Dark Knight and Spider-Man 2.\n\nIts the future, and Logan is now an old mutant, still surviving through claws and regenerative healing powers but he's growing weaker. He's taking care of Prof. X, who is now 90 years old, who still has the mind-power but its now uncontrollable. Somehow both meet a kid (X-23/Laura) who they have to save, but as it turns out she's also a mutant with Logan's DNA, hence obviously, CLAWS. The organization who created her and several other mutants, are on the hunt and the whole movie is about survival.\n\nThe kid who played Laura is so BAD-ASS, its amazing. Its a big deal to be the highlight of a movie where Hugh Jackman is the protagonist. The relationship between Prof. X, Logan and Laura are like Grandpa, Dad and daughter which makes these characters highly relatable. Patrick was amazing as a very different and never seen before Prof X. Hugh Jackman did what he has been doing last 17 years, only this was his best. Other Villainy characters did a fair job.\n\nThe movie is dark, like \"Game Of Thrones\" dark, people die, there's blood everywhere, heads and other body parts are coming off. But overall, its the best send-off they could give to Hugh as his last Wolverine film. Best part is you really don't have to watch any previous films to watch this, if you don't know what are mutants, it doesn't matter. Its a great watch for anyone (Anyone who's comfortable with blood and violence).\n\nHugh Jackman will be missed as Wolverine."

That being said, I believe this to be one of the best and most meaningful of the comic book movies made. It's dark, it's gritty, it's real and most importantly, it is NOT just another action movie. The story line brings to a head the struggles portrayed in so many other X-Men movies over the past 17 years and shows the development of characters that we've come to associate with certain actors. That being said, I would definitely not recommend this movie to younger audiences who have no familiarity with the characters or even foul language as this movie is dark but also real to life: People in Tough Situations Curse and Wolverine is Always in a Tough Situation."

When he's not chauffeuring drunken hen parties, he's in Mexico, tending to Charles Xavier, who now suffers from dementia. After a woman called Gabriela (Elizabeth Rodriguez) comes to him looking for help, Logan unwittingly becomes the protector of a young mutant called Laura (Dafne Keen), who is being hunted by a ruthless scientist (Richard E. Grant) and his armed cronies.\n\nDirector James Mangold takes a decidedly different approach to this follow up to his 2013 superhero flick The Wolverine: whereas his first outing for the Adamantium-clawed X-man was pure comic book silliness, Logan goes for gritty realism. While the sombre tone is a gutsy move, Mangold's film does have a tendency to slip into over-ponderous mode as the director attempts to add depth and poignancy to his character.\n\nMangold's story also leaves much to be desired, being yet another case of young mutants persecuted by the authorities, with our ageing hero caught in the middle. Logan's character arc is easy to predict, as is the inevitable outcome, while certain elements aren't adequately explained (the drug used to keep Xavier from having seizures, the origins of the comic containing the co-ordinates of Eden). Trite as it may be, the plot at least offers up plenty of opportunity for action, which the director handles with aplomb, his R-rating allowing for lots of blood and severed body parts.\n\nUltimately, Logan is a mixture of exhilarating (brilliantly executed fight scenes) and exasperating (the uninspired plot), bringing fans some of the best the series has to offer, but also some of the worst."

Either way, the sad reality remains, a simple and unspectacular movie like Logan gets a 8.5.\n\nThe movie begins at a somewhat slow pace. The more it progresses, the more it starts to get evident that we're not going to be seeing decent special effects. This was produced on the \"cheap\" and has a TV series feel to it. The execution and the sheer scale are not up to par with the other X-men movies, the script is lacking too. The worse part however is that this movie is supposed to give the whole X-men series closure and it does that in a very unspectacular and boring way. They rushed it, probably seeing a good opportunity to slaughter the dying cash-cow, seeing that Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart wanted to retire from playing their iconic X-man characters.\n\nA big disappointment and a sad ending to an otherwise decent franchise. Can't wrap my mind around the 8.5 mark, I guess a good part of the budget went for paying up the shills."

        "review_detailed_main": "There are those films that follow formulas and that are very successful and there are those that also become recognized and gain notoriety for not following formulas or for following other types of formulas not inherent to a certain genre. This second case is where 'Logan', by director James Mangold - fits, who had already directed the also excellent 'Wolverine Immortal \". FOX and the director decided to put a definitive end to the most acclaimed hero of comics and cinema, who followed for almost two decades and the final result is one of the great superhero stories ever written for the cinema. We are facing an innovative, courageous, incredibly creative film with performances and direction that enshrine this work and will make it remember for a long time In these more than 15 years on screen, adding both great adaptations and not so happy moments, Hugh Jackman's Wolverine was in almost everyone.\n\nBased on a story by fellow director James Mangold, the screenplay written by Scott Frank, Michael Green and Mangold himself was inspired by a more recent Mark Millar and Steve McNiven comic, 'The Old Logan'. From this story of the road - in which the aging and debilitated mutant crosses the United States in a post-apocalyptic scenario in which eccentric villains dominated the country to help an old ally deliver an illegal package - however, Logan's script takes advantage only the state of Wolverine and the idea of a dystopian future. The trio manages to deliver a first-rate drama, with a character development arc, with twists and turns and emotional and action scenes hardly portrayed in films of the genre. Being a superhero film is just one detail in the complex and striking plot. In it, we can follow a whole journey of self-knowledge and redemption of our beloved hero.\n\nIn 2029, Logan (Hugh Jackman) makes his living as a limo driver to look after nonagenarian Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart). At his side in this endeavor, we have Caliban (Stephen Merchant), one of the few mutants left. Physically debilitated and emotionally drained, he is wanted by Gabriela (Elizabeth Rodriguez), a Mexican woman who needs the help of the ex-X-Men to defend little Laura Kinney / X-23 (Dafne Keen). At the same time that he refuses to return to active duty, Logan is chased by cyborg mercenary Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook), interested in the girl.\n\nDeveloping this idea of a dystopian future well, the director deftly creates this darker, darker world and the tone of pessimism is what prevails throughout the entire projection. However, it is in the list of characters that the great asset of 'Logan' is found. Anxious by the fans, we can see the family relationship between the weakened, calloused and scarred pupil Logan and the master, Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart), the most powerful mind in the world, who now suffers mentally with advancing age. And when the girl Laura (the excellent Dafne Keen, who dominates the non-verbal expression, showing a variety of emotions with just her eyes) comes on the scene, we have the idea of family again present in Logan's life. The interaction between the trio is what sustains Logan's actions throughout the film. In one of the scenes when they pass for a family, it is one of the best in the film, with several references to Professor Xavier's Mutants School and the relationship between them. Make-up on the edge of the unrecognizable, old and tired, Jackman and Stewart do the best job as these characters have since they started this journey. The film balances these moments exceptionally well with explosions of action and fury, setting the stage for a promising and liberating continuity from the shackles of the confused canon established in the X-Men universe in theaters. At no time does he worry about being didactic, does not use cards or voice-overs to prepare us for this future, he passes on to us every information we need to know through his dialogues and does not waste time offering us the causes of all that . At no time did we discover Xavier's disease, Alzheimer's is only left in the air through Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant), who is also the apparent culprit for the disappearance of the mutants, a fact that we also do not understand how it happened and, fact, we don't need to know.\n\nThe film already establishes the state of the mutant in the first few seconds of the projection, making it clear that his glory days are gone. Hugh Jackman arrives with a wistful air, red eyes and a wobbly walk. The excessive use of alcohol acts as a way of escape for Wolverine not having to deal with his biggest enemy: the guilt he carries for everything he did in other times. To work this out visually, director James Mangold bets on open plans to show the ruin of the scenarios and on closed plans to create an intimate connection with the people shown there.\n\nJames Mangold makes 'Logan' a road movie with several turns. Forget if you expect a classic superhero movie, with cover heroes and scenes full of special effects. Realism sets the tone, not only in the setting, but also in the action scenes. Logan also knew how to take advantage of his higher rating to give fans the brutal violence they always wanted from Wolverine. However, management did not use this freedom to deliver rampant gore and profanity out of context - everything was used for the sake of history.\n\nIt is not an action movie with dramatic sequences, but a drama movie with action sequences. The scenes of violence in the place where Wolverine and Caliban took care of Professor Xavier are visceral. It was also the first time that we saw sweet Laura showing a side that even shocked the viewer. Talent and pure competence of the young Dafne Keen, who manages to pass the innocence and sweetness of a child at the same time that she is able to cut cold and violently with anger and fury several of her persecutors. The graphic violence of blades piercing heads, necks, arms, viscera is present to exhaustion here and is repeated in the scenes of the Harrah hotel and casino in Oklahoma, on the Munson family farm, and the last act near the border for Eden. In all the scenes, brutality, strength and realism impress and shock the audience, on purpose. Filmed millimeter, each blow or injury is felt. In the X-Men movies we never saw Wolverine really release all of his anger and show off the killer animal he is. In 'Logan', the film is not afraid to show all the blood and violence it entails.\n\nIt is certain, however, that Logan - even though he idolizes his origin in the comics all the time - could have been more \"heroic\". Were it not for the claws and powers, the film would go very well as an action drama disconnected from this legacy of the hero. By anchoring him in a supposed realism, looking for the adult Wolverine that fans had been waiting for years and without really exploring the potential of villains like Pierce and the Butchers, Mangold and Jackman disregard another aspect of the character that was desired ... the super -classic hero, who is once again left in the imagination - in conversations about the past and what was left behind. A superhero movie, a road movie, a western, a family drama, a farewell letter, a new start, which teaches you \"not to be what they did to you\". Anyway, a movie. A great movie. No label. Full of symbolism, James Mangold's feature opposes past and present, youth and old age, nostalgia and novelty to make the baton pass to a new generation. 'Logan' is a visceral experience that leaves the bittersweet taste of questioning about life and death, about the past and the wrong choices left in it and also about the possibility of redemption. Perhaps the film will not appeal to those who seek something similar to other superhero films, but it will certainly delight everyone who seeks a melancholy, harsh, tense drama in many moments, but above all human. This does not mean that 'Logan' is better than traditional superhero films, but it is simply different, in discarding everything we could expect from him. And the most impressive thing is that the film can do this without being pretentious. It is a film full of emotional and unique in which Hugh Jackman delivers the best performance of his career, honoring almost two decades playing the character in a farewell worthy of reverences marking his name in the history of cinema."

Tons of ACTION - rarely a dull moment! We get a new enemy (rather than the same story of mutant vs. Mutant clans). Even better was the heroes were mostly children - so, a very different type X-Men movie\n\nThe ending felt kind of flat, and disappointing - that's probably my biggest complaint!\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Even if you're not a huge fan of the Logan/Wolverine character - this movie is EXCELLENT!"

Not that it is bad, not at all, but I will stress that I mostly consider it a spin-off, and therefore my favorite \"X-Men\" movie is still Day of Future Past.\n\nBut in this movie Logan is approached by a nurse who recognices him as the Wolverine and wants his help, but he doesn't want to. But that woman ends up turning his life upside-down because she knows something unsettling involving an 11-year-old girl and a gang of other mutant kids.\n\nThis story adaption is just all out violent, sad, gory and packs up all the heartbreaking events we got in the comic, so if you don't mind all the severed limbs and children being harmed, then you're in for a hellride of emotions. It does give itself room for some quiter moments to let us get into the wants and hardships of the characters, so it works as a satisfying journey with enough growth and bonding to make you care for them."

It's surpassed that. Hugh Jackman, the man, \"The Wolverine\". IRREPLACEABLE!!! Next is, the character \"Laura\". That kid, the depth in her eyes, spoke a lot. In many ways, she was over shadowing Hugh Jackman. Seriously, FOR REAL. At that moment, I was like, Tom hardy, respectfully can take a backseat and let \"Laura\" take over as \"The Wolverine\".\n\nThere are no end credit scenes in this movie. Many say, after the trailers and the movie begins, there is a pre-credit scene. I was right there sitting even before the trailers began and came across no credit scenes. I saw it online while typing this. Maybe it differs from Country to Country.\n\nPeace Out!"

I never understood 'X-Men', I thought it was the worst superhero film series I've ever seen. But 'Wolverine' was the only reason I watched them all and particular, Hugh Jackman. There won't be Logan now onwards, though a set of new generation welcomed in this film, while saying goodbye to the old guys. So now what happens in the future of this franchise is a very suspense. Yet Logan had been the precious gem in the crown of 'X-Men', that mean it won't be the same anymore.\n\nAfter many years passed in the future, the last survivours of mutants hiding their identity and living among the humans. Logan and two others were attacked by the armed men when he decided to help a child mutant. Running away from them and looking for a place where they can be safe prioritised in the narration. More dramatised film in the franchise, but there are enough actions those who desire for that.\n\nIt's an emotional time for the hardcore fans of Logan/Hugh Jachman. One final great performance by him and the little kid was also good. A well shot film, with minimum graphics and more realistic stunt sequences. Well, not all were real, too strong fights, too bloody, despite having a child actor in it. Yeah, it is a good film, I liked it, but not a masterpiece as you might have heard of. But anyway, it is a must see for the 'Wolverine' fans.\n\n7/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Wolverine has had quite a bumpy and uneven ride since Jackman took on the role back in 2000. He's been in the main trilogy, he's made appearances in the prequel-trilogy and has had also three spin-offs of his own. As charismatic as the character and the actor playing him are, all of his stand alone outings ended up lacking just that: charisma.\n\nWhile Origins is often pinned down as a disaster, The Wolverine follow up ended up being a truly catastrophic mess; and despite Mangold's efforts to make amends in this final outing, \"Logan\" is not as strong as it should have been and also isn't the proper conclusion the character needed. The whole selling point was to adapt the Old Man Logan comic as the send-off to the iconic mutant with an R-Rating, an approach the character was craving for since 2000. The gripping action is there, the acting is unexpectedly superior for comic-book films' standards and there's enough character development to elevate the film. Nevertheless, Mangold somehow manages to have the film feel uncomfortably familiar, predictable and deficient denoting a weak directing pulse and sense of conclusion urgency.\n\nAs an avid X-Men fan and Jackman's interpretation of Wolverine, I ended up finding all three of the solo outings lacking in a way the ensemble ones (even the weaker ones) never did; he has inhabited Wolverine from day one and it is quite astonishing how he's made 9 appearances in the franchise and none of those felt flat, phoned-in or tired. It was a fully physical and emotional commitment to the mythos that honestly doesn't leave much space left for anyone else to take on or reinterpret(although sadly, we know it's bound to happen)."

And this time he sure made a comeback with Logan. So needless to say , Hugh Jackman was great as wolverine and the little girl who played x23 was great too , the bad guy was good but would've sucked if it weren't for the R rating. Patrick Stewart was 'okay' as for most of the movie , he's just an old dude in a wheelchair annoying Logan. There are many references to the previous x men movies but without giving reason on what happened to the rest of the x men .The story is not your typical superhero movie , its a road trip drama with lots of gorey action and that's the best part , because you see wolverine for the animal he is. So ,in the end , Logan is not just a good superhero movie but a great movie with loads of action , good one liners , great characters and one big farewell for Hugh Jackman."

It may be the best superhero film ever made. Then again, it's hard to say. Is it it even fair to call it a superhero film? It's more like a gritty western. This film is the perfect conclusion to the X-men films, and to Wolverine's tale. If X-men 3 ruined X-Men in the worst way, than Logan killed off the franchise (for me) in the best way possible. It broke my heart again and again. The characters I loved are at their absolute lowest and worst. The action has never been more spectacular and violent. Wolverine is at his absolute finest in brutality and in Hugh Jackman's performance. The inclusion of a new young girl mutant also brings in a great new character. This film left me in tears with all that occurred from beginning to end. It's so hard to sit through this film but I can't dislike it. Of all the X-men films, this one truly has the most heart."

Slooow to kick off, lots of repetitive violence of the same kind, little emotional attachment to any character (especially the girl, who spends most of her time either doing bugger all or making holes in people's heads, shoulders, knees and toes), a plot so compromised Logan himself couldn't make any more holes in it with his pointy bits. One very annoying technical aspect was the cheap lens they used that created really noticeable parallax distortion every time the operator pulled focus. Made me feel ill. Have you noticed that any Marvel film gets highly rated on IMDb - I'm convinced they employ lots of kids in bedrooms to submit fake reviews."

It is also too long, I should have cut it a little more. But the film is not bad, it can be seen, it is fundamentally the entry of the new mutants to continue the franchise. I will be generous: 6."

He's an OAS (Old Age Superhero) and, as such, it doesn't take much for his superpowers to run out long before the Duracell Bunny would like.\n\nAnd that opens up a depth of story line that is seldom seen in these franchise affairs.\n\nIt requires, and is given, a quality script and a complexity of performance that makes it both engaging and sustaining throughout.\n\nIt won't be my movie of the year by a long shot (and it fails to breathe the sort of life into an old vein that Mad Max Fury Road did two years ago) but it's an excellent evening's entertainment and I'd recommend it."

        "review_title": "A masterpiece, and one of the best comic-book/superhero films of all time.",
        "review_detailed_main": "What is there to even say about Logan? There is a short list of superhero films that go beyond the tier of \"pretty fun\" and \"entertaining\" into genuine masterpiece territory, and on pretty much everyone's list, Logan is there. It's well deserved, and especially true for me in context of the rest of the series.\n\nIf you, like me, felt that the X-Men franchise had strayed a bit too far from its character focused, soap opera roots, then Logan is really the movie for you. I find it funny when people say that this is \"less of a superhero movie, and more of a Western,\" when distinctions like that don't exist in the comics. (When you're writing literally hundreds of stories for characters, different genres inevitably pop up). Logan honestly feels like a graphic novel brought to life, as it's more self-contained and character-focused that typical films like this.\n\nI have to admire James Mangold's courage to go truly BLEAK and depressing here; the world of Logan is a miserable place, where we see beloved characters become shells of themselves. The X-Men are a distant memory. Professor X suffers from seizures and dementia. Logan, sick by the adamantium bones that once made him indestructible, is slowly accepting death.\n\nWhen I complain about the lack of world building in later trilogy, I feel even more vindicated by how AMAZING the world building in this movie is. Everything from the technology to the culture to the politics feels very well thought out but never in your face. (It's crazy how OBVIOUS a commentary this movie is on the Trump administration when you rewatch, with migration, xenophobia, and an honest-to-God blonde villain named DONALD)\n\nThis is also one of those rare times where the R-rating absolutely elevates the film in every way. We've seen a version of this movie before without it, also directed by James Mangold: The Wolverine. The blood and gore are purposeful, reflective of a brutal, unkind world where even children can inflict horrible violence. Without, the movie wouldn't work nearly as well (and let's be real, the R rating was an undeniable box office draw).\n\nThe performances in this movie are next level. Hugh Jackman delivers what is honestly an Oscar worthy turn as Logan; he's a different character, but constantly reminds us why audiences fell in love with him in the first place. A 17 year culmination of his cinematic depiction of Wolverine, this performance is a masterpiece. He shows so much range, vulnerability, and ferocity here and it's truly amazing.\n\nPatrick Stewart's heartbreaking performance as Professor X is what, I know for a fact, probably drove many people to tears. The sadness and desperation in his eyes, the hope he feels, the deterioration that's so evident; even little moments when he sneers at Logan when taking his pills are so true-to-life for us that have seen loved ones decline mentally, it's also honestly, Oscar worth.\n\nWe also need to talk about Dafne Keen. While I would've preferred her stay non verbal or at least solely speaking Spanish, I can't deny how unbelievable she is as X-23. He inhuman shrieks are exactly what I imagined the character to sound like. She has a vulnerability and childishness that feels realistic, yet is an absolute killing machine and neither feel awkward. You can fully buy that she's the type of kid to play with the locks on a car door to annoy her Dad, but also decapitate a man with ease. Also, shout out to Stephen Merchant as Caliban, a character I cannot believe we've seen TWICE in this series.\n\nI also initially didn't like the idea of Wolverine vs. Younger Wolverine when I first saw this movie, but I was wrong. It was a stroke of genius to have an older, weaker Logan face off against his prime self: another example of the movie using a sensible plot element as subtext to drive the theme - aging and acceptance - home. Like all great movies, it's not only great on its own terms, but is ABOUT something and a movie that honestly resonates more with me the older I get.\n\nI also love how this movie - despite its darkness - is still inherently hopeful. I don't think you could've crafted a better ending, honestly. The final shot still gives me goosebumps every time.\n\nI've always found it funny that Wolverine - a dude who has claws that come of out his hands and super healing - became the face of the X-Men. We have people who can control weather, teleport, shoot lasers out of their eyes, but this guy is the one everyone adores? What this movie so beautifully demonstrates is there's a complexity and deep humanity to this character that can't be matched.\n\nYeah, this one is special."

        "review_detailed_main": "The decision to make this rated R was such a perfect choice for both the tone and the story of this film. It's dark, gruesome, somber, and definitely gory. Hugh Jackman has his best act yet as he departs away from Wolverine (at least for now) carrying a huge, dark and heartbreaking performance. Storytelling is also huge in this, definitely the darkest X-Men film thus far with huge stakes as our beaten down Wolverine and elderly Prof. X try to help Laura - a young mutant. The only thing that can be said negatively about this film is the pacing, the second act of this film is mostly traveling and learning about Laura and her past. But the first and final act all ride really fast and are thrilling to watch. Even with how dark this film is, theres some pretty solid humor in both the first and second act before taking an even darker tone in the final act. And the action, oh man what do I even say. It's so brutal and gruesome its honestly just what we all wanted from a Wolverine film. Dafne Keen even has some crazy awesome action scenes. I hope we get to see more of her in this role."
