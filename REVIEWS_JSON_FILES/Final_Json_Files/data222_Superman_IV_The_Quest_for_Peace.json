        "review_detailed_main": "SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE\n\nOK... so everyone knows that this is the worst Superman movie ever made... but if you have not seen it in a while, you should watch it.\n\nIt is still pretty rubbish, but it is not as bad as I remember.\n\nThe story is not that bad... Superman rids planet Earth of all the nuclear weapons, and in doing so unknowingly creates a super villain named Nuclear Man thanks to arch rival Lex Luthor.\n\nThe movie does star all the original cast, which surprised me. I knew Christopher Reeve was in it... and after reading his autobiography now know why. He said in the book that he only made it because the film studio wanted to make it and they said to him that they would only finance another movie he wanted to make if he made Superman IV. I will quote what he said in his book... \"The less said about Superman IV the better.\"\n\nGene Hackman returns as Lex Luthor & Margot Kidder is back as Lois Lane. They all did good jobs as always, although Margot was a bit unsure in places. The other supporting cast were not great. Mariel Hemingway played the new boss of the Daily Planet. She was awful... not a great actress in this I'm afraid. But she was not the worst. Mark Pillow played Nuclear Man. Absolutely terrible. His acting was definitely the worst of the whole quadrilogy.\n\nThe effects in this film were so bad. You could see that the budget of this film was so much less than the other 3 movies made. Superman flying was so bad that Flash Gordon was more convincing... and speaking of Flash Gordon... Nuclear Man looked like him... but more camp! Nuclear Mans outfit was embarrassing... it was not much of a super villains outfit. It honestly was just a bad character through and through.\n\nThere are also some really bad scenes... there was a scene where a large chuck of the Great Wall of China gets destroyed and Superman fixes it just by looking at it and using some dodgy blue eye lasers. What the hell? Terrible. Also, there is a scene where Nuclear Man kidnaps a Lacy and takes her into space... WHAT? He drags her to space and not only does she not scream or even say anything, but she can breathe fine in space... erm... really? I know Superman was never meant to be realistic, but that is too much!\n\nWhen I was a kid I was a big fan of the Superman movies... but I think my parents protected me from this disappointment, because I don't remember this film at all... I didn't see this film until I was an adult. Haha. Thanks Mum.\n\nI will give this film 5 out of 10.\n\nIt's a shame about this film... it was a very disappointing ending to Christopher Reeves Superman career. But no matter what he will always be a legend.\n\nFor more reviews, please like my Facebook page:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl"

        "review_detailed_main": "Superman (Christopher Reeve) continues his life of costumed superhero and Daily Planet reporter Clark Kent. As the Daily Planet is taken over by tabloid magnate David Warfield (Sam Wanamaker), Clark and fellow reporter Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) find themselves uneasy with the more sensationalist route taken by the paper's new owner and editor/David's daughter Lacy (Mariel Hemingway) who also has a crush on Clark. Meanwhile the failure of a summit between the United States and Soviet Union causes both nations to increase production of their nuclear stockpiles. A young boy, Jeremy (Damian McLawhorn), writes a letter to Superman asking why Superman can't dispose of the nuclear weapons himself, and while he's uncertain about whether he should get involved following public pressure Superman makes an announcement that he will rid the world of nuclear weapons singlehandedly. While Superman's words and actions are met with approval by the public and (I think) several public officials, they irk war profiteers, military strategic think tanks, and others whose pocketbooks and political standing is threatened by the new development. Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) having escaped from prison with the aid of his dimwitted nephew Lenny Luthor (Jon Cryer) formulates a plan with the help of those with vested interest in preserving the arms race to create a nuclear clone of Superman which comes in the form of Nuclear Man (physically played by Mark Pillow, voiced by Gene Hackman) who has the power to destroy the Superman.\n\nFollowing the disappointing response to Superman III and disastrous response to Supergirl, Ilya and Alexander Salkind scrapped a planned Superman IV and out of financial necessity sold the rights to Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus of The Cannon Group, Inc. For $5 million in 1985. When Christopher Reeve was approached by Cannon to reprise his role he was reluctant, but Cannon offered Reeve $6 million, story input, director approval, and financing and distribution for Reeve's long stalled pet project Street Smart. With Reeve on board, Cannon was able to lure back other veteran members of the Superman cast such as Gene Hackman and Margot Kidder who hated the Salkinds for their abusive treatment (especially of Richard Donner) and underhanded and duplicitous dealings so the change in producers was seen as a fresh start. While Superman IV was a priority for Cannon, the movie beset with production difficulties from day one with the promised $36 million budget slashed to $17 million, which lead to downscaling in the special effects and locations with noticeable results. As a company, Cannon had often kept themselves afloat with foreign presales to upcoming movies as well as sales of TV and home media rights to current films used to keep the cycle afloat with their primary output being action and horror fare of $5 million or less that could continue this endless cycle and in essence \"robbing Peter to pay paul\". With movies above that $5 million threshold the company didn't have that windfall hence why Superman IV was so troubled. Superman IV is considered the worst film in the Superman series and often labeled one of the worst of all time, and it's hard to disagree because not only is it a stupid story, but unlike the previous films it's not even technically competent.\n\nSuperman IV is an anti-war movie with Reeve credited with a story credit. Reeve was apparently inspired based on his personally reaction to the failure of the 1986 Reykjavik Summit as well as then President Reagan's military buildup and skepticism towards arms control. Now on the surface that's not an awful idea, but when you have Superman making declarations he will singlehandedly remove all Nuclear Weapons from the Earth without consulting with the leaders it feels like it goes contrary to his character. Now as much as I don't like this direction....it does unfortunately have comic book precedent. In stories that Marv Wolfman wrote for the comic Adventures of Superman that ran concurrently with John Byrne's run in the main series that reintroduced the character \"post crisis\", Superman did undertake a one man crusade against the fictional Middle Eastern nation of Qurac destroying all their weapons and artillery so as dumb as this plot is, it's not the first time this route has been taken with the character. The movie is a disjointed mess with a number of dangling unresolved subplots and jumps due to the fact that the movie's 110 minute runtime was trimmed to 89 minutes making it the shortest Superman film by a considerable margin. Not that the footage being put back in would've helped because the script is not only stupid with its very reductive look at the arms race and the nature thereof, but the comedy present in these movies has reached the worst of hackneyed writing with Superman now utilizing the dreaded \"two dates to the prom\" setup that doesn't even have a proper payoff to that tired clich\u00e9. In fact many of the \"jokes\" feel like they're missing punchlines or reactions which is probably a tell tale sign of things that were cut.\n\nReeve remains good as Superman (his poorly thought out story notwithstanding) and Gene Hackman looks like he's at least having fun despite his knowledge of how bad he movie is. But most of the other performances, effects, and set pieces feel passable at best or unfinished at worst. The Superman films have always had competent work at minimum and you do not get that here. Editing is often shoddy, characters have knowledge of things they shouldn't, things explode despite a lack of projectiles, it wouldn't surprise me if not only was the budget slashed in half, but the post and foley work also felt the wrath of Cannon's budget scissors.\n\nSuperman IV is bad, but it is at least fascinatingly bad. The same goofy optimism that began this series is on full display, except without the brain that added substance to the silliness. Even at their lowest point the Salkind Superman movies gave us at least ONE scene that we could say \"that's impressive\" like the Clark Kent vs. Superman fight in Superman III, or Supergirl being stranded on The Phantom Zone in Supergirl. Here however, I can't name one scene that even approaches good. If you watch this movie you'll watch it all the way to the end, and you'll even laugh, but only in the manner most befitting watching a trainwreck."

The movie has obviously been cut from its original length make it incoherent at times. The special effects are below the standards set in the first two movies (even the third movie had decent effects). Maybe if the movie were restored to its original length, it would be better. I can only give this movie a 5/10. I wished it were better and hope someday they do restore this movie to its original length."

Special effects were horrible as well as character development and plot line. How could any studio head or those involved with the final print of this film feel comfortable with the finished project?\n\nTalk about a film that rode on the popularity of its predecessors and failed to live up to any expectations that fans of the earlier films had. This movie certainly was the nail in the coffin as far as the Christopher Reeve Superman films go. And for what it's worth I fall in the category that feels Superman 3 was better than this mess.

It was great seeing the Superman cast back together again, including Gene Hackman who we haven't seen since Superman II. This time, Alexander and Ilya Salkind were not producing the movie. Instead, Menaham Golan and Yoram Globus, the owners of Cannon films, were producing. If you ask me, the Salkinds knew how to make a Superman movie better than those two.\n\nIn Superman IV, Superman hears the threat of Nuclear War over and over, and so he decides that he will rid the world of every nuclear weapon known to man. At the same time, Lex Luthor has broken out of jail again and this time, his sidekick is his dorky nephew Lenny. The two criminals create a device that they put on one of the nuclear weapons and that ends up creating Nuclear Man. Nuclear Man has the same powers as Superman but, the only difference is that Nuclear Man gets his power from the sun.\n\nWhile all of this is going on, The Dailey Planet is being controlled by a tycoon and his daughter who has her eye on Clark Kent.\n\nSo Superman has a big job here: SAVE THE WORLD FROM NUCLEAR DESTRUCTION!\n\nI'm going to say that, anyone who has seen the first three Superman films, then just go ahead and see IV because it would be a shame to not see the film that is last in the series. But, in my opinion, I didn't like it much. I think Alexander & Ilya Salkind would've made a hell of a last movie."

Oh, and he has a new sidekick: Nuclear Man!\n\nMany people have given this a lower rating (understandably), but a 3 or 4 out of 10? It really is not that bad. The film is fun, fast-paced and very watchable. Some consider it the worst, but I did not find it any better or worse than part 3. Granted, parts 1 and 2 are superior (thanks Richard Donner) but I've seen many worse films than Superman 4.\n\nRandom thoughts: The double date scene was clever, but really annoying and completely pointless. If Superman would just reveal himself to Lois Lane he wouldn't have to find other girls on the side... although see below.\n\nThe idea of getting rid of nuclear weapons was very nice and a great social and political commentary. I agree getting rid of nuclear weapons would be a good move. But the film made this very unrealistic. The world cheers him on, when in reality the countries would protest. He invades a variety of countries and steals their to secret hidden weapons (not sure on the legality or logistics of that). And what is to stop someone from building these weapons all over again?\n\nWhat happened to Lana Lang? At the end of part 3, it looked like Superman finally realized that Lois Lane is a loser and hooked up with Lana. But she is never seen or mentioned in part 4, despite working for the Daily Planet (at least as of the last film). What gives?\n\nDoes anyone else think Lex Luthor is getting a little tired? Did we really need 3 films with Luthor and one with a Luthor knockoff? What about Brainiac or Bizarro or the Eradicator or just about anyone else? Heck, General Zod is so much cooler than Luthor (with all due respect to Gene Hackman).\n\nThere's a scene where he rebuilds the great wall of China just by looking at it. What power did he use? Tractor beams from his nipples?\n\nBut anyway, this film is not as bad as many would have you believe, and if you've spent six hours on the first three, you might as well invest 90 more minutes in this series finale."

It's also a film that clearly shows the limits of special effects, as even with 1980s technology the film should have looked so much better--especially since it's about the most effects-laden Superman film up to that time.\n\nThe story is full of saccharine when the entire planet stops to take notice of some little boy who writes to Superman to request that he bring about world peace! Superman, never wanting to disappoint any child, responds by destroying the world's nuclear stockpile. However, Lex Luthor disguises one of the nuclear missiles as just a garden variety nuclear bomb when really it's infused with some Superman DNA. So, when the missile is tossed into the sun, it naturally produces an evil Krytonian who is bent on killing Superman and working for Luthor. Can our incredibly plastic hero destroy this evil menace AND balance two women...one who is beautiful and loves Clark and another who's an idiot who STILL can't understand that Clark and Superman are the same freaking guy!!\n\nWhile the story is saccharine and stupid and the special effects quite bad, the film team do manage to also make the acting terrible- -even by Superman standards. The standout in this department is Jon Cryer-- who really can act. But given the bilge the writers (a room full of baboons, I think), he comes off as simply annoying and hateful. The rest, by the way, aren't much better.\n\nSo do I recommend this film? Yes and no. No if you want to see a decent film. Yes if you are either using it to torture someone or if you are a glutton for punishment, like me, and occasionally enjoy laughing at Hollywood stars destroying themselves. A little schadenfreude is what's needed to enjoy this picture, that's for sure."

Lacy Warfield (Mariel Hemingway) is the new woman at the paper who falls for Clark Kent. Meanwhile, nephew Lenny (Jon Cryer) helps spring Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) from prison work detail. Using a strand of Superman's hair, Lex Luthor creates Nuclear Man.\n\nThe movie is pretty boring and even more silly than all the others. There are a lot of problems with the ridiculous nature of this movie. Nephew Lenny is annoyingly silly. The premise of the world politics is stupid. The idea that Superman would reveal his identity and kiss it away just to ease his mind seems wrong. The effects may have actually gotten worst. However the biggest mistake is the idea that Superman would get rid of all the nuclear weapons.\n\nDuring WWII, Superman never really battle the Nazis or the Japanese directly. It was a matter of Superman not be a God like figure to direct and interfere with mankind's wars. If Superman is to act like God, then the reaction from the earth's political and commercial powers have to act more realistically. This movie is too silly and simplistic dealing with world politics.

Riding the world of nuclear weapons was a good start, a nice foundation to build on; unfortunately there was not enough money to finish the film and it was released unfinished.\n\nThe other nice things about this film are the return of Lex Luthor,and the return to seriousness in the film series. One can only wonder how this movie would have turned out had all the necessary funding been there.\n\nThe special effects are just plain horrible, and the audience winces as Superman makes his 'dramatic entrance' by saving a space capsule from spinning into the Earth's atmosphere and rescuing a man falling into space. Everytime Reeve is in flight, the animated Superman is obvious to everyone, and it is sad to see this; for the audience no longer believes a man can fly, but that a cartoon can instead.\n\nSo many scenes are deleted from this movie that it is confusing to understand just how certain key elements of the film are executed, or worse yet, why!\n\nThe only scene which holds interest for a little while is the climatic battle between Superman and Nuclear Man, at best the scene gets a mediocre.\n\nSo far this has been the final entry of the Superman series, and although the film is exceptionally weak. Christopher Reeve once again sparkles as the Man of Steel. He always gave an excellent performance as Superman even when the movies where sub-par, and that speaks plenty.\n\nAt least the ending to this movie is done well with Superman flying out of the Earth and smiling at us as he flies off into space, protecting the world; that alone will always inspire some kind of hope to people."

That was because the stories got increasingly juvenile and silly, and tried to too hard to be decent and honorable and a teacher of sorts. In other words... boring!\n\nYet even in this time, the DC comics were simple fun escapism and the artwork of Curt Swan made it palatable to the eye. The same could be said of Superman IV: The Quest For Peace. The budget was obviously lower and the platitudes higher (due to Christopher Reeve's need to make a statement about nuclear proliferation) but the film as its moments of excitement, particularly in the scene between Superman and the manufactured super-villain of Lex Luthor, a sort of Sun-Man.\n\nI still prefer it to be second film in the series. That one, at least for me, really bit the big one. That's why I rate it higher than Superman II."

OK your probably thinking I'm mental for liking a film thats got a review of 3.3...but bear with it as I will explain why I like it.\n\nOK first off when I was younger I watched a film that had superman in it and a superman in a black costume....but I could never remember what superman it was, I knew it wasn't the first one or the third because I had them on video, so it was bound to be the second.\n\nWhen superman two was on sky movies I watched it and to my shock it didn't have that bit of cinema and action that I remembered watching as a child. After countless google searches I finally found out there was a superman four so quickly got hold of a copy and watched it...this is where the review begins.\n\nTo begin with it has almost all the original cast back for the final film of the series, which is nice on its own, the opening sequence is (I will admit) abit poor compared to the previous films but when you hear the music you know your watching a superman film. Anyway the film goes on and superman starts to deal with issues that are important, a child writes to him and asks him to take all the nuclear weapons off earth and destroy them, to begin with superman isn't too sure on the idea. Anyway in the end he does destroy them, mean while Lex Luthor steals one of superman's hairs from a museum and uses it to create Nuclear Man, basically an evil superman...well it's almost exactly like superman except hes blonde and needs the sun to get energy on a more extreme level than superman.\n\nStill the movie has some great action sequences and fits in well to the other superman films, though you do have to take this for what it is \"a comic book movie\" it is good at what it is, you have to watch it and forget everything you where ever taught or believe...OK some of the stuff like the fight on the moon is abit extreme but it's a SUPERman movie. I can only suggest you watch this movie but just don't take it seriously it is a nice movie to watch and it is memorable which I hope is the message you got from the beginning of this review."

Being somewhat of a Liberal \"peacenik,\" he was the kind you'd see out with a big \"peace sign\" at rallies against nuclear weapons.This movie had the kind of message that was dear to his heart.\n\nSuperman goes about trying to rid the world of nuclear weapons here, especially, of course when they get into the hands of villain \"Dr. Luthor\" (Gene Hackman). It was a nice message and, overall, a nice film. Unlike the other Superman films of the era, they didn't overdo the sappy romance with \"Lois Lane\" (Margot Kidder). They concentrated more on the story. Unfortunately, that story - even with good intentions - just wasn't all that memorable.\n\nAsk anyone: people remember the first two Reeve Superman films a lot more than the last two. This one, and the third one with Richard Pryor, pretty much \"bombed\" at the box office, at least compared to the others.\n\nIt did not help that the producers of this movie were Golan-Globus films, guys that were known for their cheap and usually-sleazy exploitation films. \"Superman\" deserved better."

        "review_detailed_main": "I will not succumb to the temptation of reminding everyone once again how terrible the special effects are and how many times one can see the supporting wires. Instead I will focus on the few good aspects of the movie. Chris Reeve is once again great in being superman and Gene Hackman is an absolute joy to watch as the menacing Luthor with only one thing on his mind \"Destroy superman\". The references to the first two movies e.g.flying sequence with Lois Lane and the well known score remind us of why they were so successful.\n\nI agree with the nonsensical space sequence but not so much with superman moving the moon. It's a comic book movie after all and in the first film he managed to get the earth out of orbit! You know the whole idea of a man flying and being invincible is quite impossible so why don't you pick on that too? In superman's world anything can happen.\n\nHowever what is painful for me personally is Warner Bros not being bothered to refurbish superman 4 just like Lucas did with the original star wars trilogy(added better sound, new scenes e.g. Hayden Christensen at the end of the return of the Jedi). They could use modern technology and hide the visible wires and improve the flying sequences. I am sure it won't be expensive. Plus why not even restore the 45 minutes of deleted footage? Dick Donner did so in the first film and also later this year a new restored cut of superman 2 is coming out with all the deleted Donner footage. Why not patch up a low budget effort and restore superman's former glory?\n\nFor the performances of Reeve, Hackman and the rest of the common superman characters I chose to give this film 5 out of 10 and I hope that one day we will see it patched up."

        "review_title": "An insult to fans and a disgrace to the franchise",
        "review_detailed_main": "Shall I recap Christopher Reeve's \"Superman\" franchise and the roller-coaster ride it was? It began with Superman in 1978, a strong, faithful adaptation of the comic book hero, bright and colorful, fun to watch, exciting in its action, and overall, a serviceable, genuinely entertaining piece of filmmaking. Its sequel was an equally strong film and, thanks to a refreshing but controversial change in directors, welcomed in a more satirical, comedic take on the comic-book character. It was fun and enchanting, if still accentuating the plastic kind-of qualities its predecessor had. By Superman III is when the character started taking a nosedive back to earth. The film lacked the great chemistry that was erected in the first two films, and focused predominately on a lame villain and an uninteresting character ironically played by the very interesting Richard Pryor.\n\nAnd now we have Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, a cinematic disgrace to the character in every regard that could've been prevented if something called source-material-respect was implemented. The production history of Superman IV is heavily noted, with a lot of it being revealed in Reeve's post-paralysis autobiography Still Me. Reeve's participation was made possible by a convincing deal, but even in his heart he knew it wasn't right. The film was made by Canon Films who, at the time, had thirty movies in productions. Superman IV wasn't treated any different than other winners the company had set for release at the time like American Ninja 2: The Confrontation and Death Wish 4: The Crackdown. Enormous budget slashing, extreme cutbacks in nearly every film department, and the lack of interest in making a film that would rebound the mediocre response to Superman III all lead to the dismal product that is Superman IV.\n\nYou can almost see it in the cast's face that they have little enthusiasm for the material they're currently acting in. Even Reeve, whose face gleamed and personality erupted when he did his first big scene in the original film, has seemingly checked out of this franchise. Gene Hackman's return to the franchise, too, feels forced and looks as if he is totally uninteresting with what is happening, and additional talent from Margot Kidder, Jon Cryer, Sam Wanamaker, and the lovely, beautiful Mariel Hemingway is all wasted on a third-rate script.\n\nThe plot involves the \"Daily Planet\" newspaper being bought out by a journalist tycoon who favors sensationalistic titles over real journalism, leading to Clark Kent and Lois Lane's (Margot Kidder) job to be more about catering to the narrow-minded and stretching the truth rather than about honest journalism. Lacy (Mariel Hemingway), the tycoon's daughter, also takes a liking to Clark and his kind ways, as she desperately tries to throw herself onto him at every conceivable opportunity. And if that's not enough, Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) has returned, this time with his son Lenny (Jon Cryer). They are planning to create \"Nuclear Man,\" a man to battle Superman since they have failed numerous times on their own to destroy him.\n\nWith a larger budget and maybe a studio that took this material seriously and recognized they needed a colossal rebound after Superman III, these ideas could've worked just as well as in the first two films. But under the stiff, clearly rushed direction of Sidney J. Furie (who already had several films under his belt when this was released, so I'm sure circumstances and time constraints were mostly to blame) and the effortless special effects (again, likely caused by budget constraints), this is an incredibly paltry effort to revitalize a franchise.\n\nNot to mention, a trilogy is understandable, but a fourth movie after the third film already seemed that the end was nigh? This seems like an outright joke in itself. Even the subtitle for the film, \"The Quest for Peace,\" leaves a person slightly confused. Wasn't that practically the ultimate goal in the last three films, whether it be peace and silence from Lex Luthor or Ross Webster's exhaustive computer hacking plan? Superman IV: A Quest for Peace is a rather disingenuous ending to a franchise many loved and many adored until lackluster decisions were made in the franchise's latter half. While the series had always maintained sort of this plastic quality I have been talking about, where characters do what is mostly expected of them and there's little deeper, below-the-surface mystery, the first two installments of the series were fun and quite exciting. What it evolved into was something no fan asked for and no fan deserve.\n\nI laugh at how one of the opening scenes in the offices of the \"Daily Planet\" show the journalistic tycoon implementing controlling policies and budget cuts to make his vision of the newspaper. Something tells me that's how the production of the film went, with the tycoon being Canon Films and the angry staff the cast.\n\nStarring: Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman, Jackie Cooper, Marc McClure, Jon Cryer, Sam Wanamaker, Margot Kidder, Mariel Hemingway, and Mark Pillow. Directed by: Sidney J. Furie."

Somewhere in this mess is a good film that isn't allowed to break free, haphazard and lazy direction from a mediocre director and two very lame scriptwriters make sure of that.\n\nThe idea in itself isn't bad. Superman becomes active in disarming the world of nuclear weapons but his arch nemesis Lex Luthor still holds a grudge against the Man of Steel and devices a plan to get rid of him; by creating a super villain of his own.\n\nReeve shares co-credit story this time around but he's not responsible for the terrible script. There are good things floating around but executed in the poorest manner. And what's more the special effects are terrible, I can't believe they saved money on that front. The film moves along too fast, clocking in at under 90 minutes and some interesting angles are not explored nearly well enough.\n\nSo what's good here? Well, Reeve of course. He IS Superman and once again delivers a fantastic performance and shows all too well that he's way too good for this film. Margot Kidder is good as well but her role is minimal and Jackie Cooper appears all too briefly. So that leaves Hackman. Of course it's good to see him, he's a very good actor, but one can't help but think he got a big paycheck and simply did what he had to and nothing more. He doesn't look too excited.\n\nA wasted opportunity this film. Could have been very good but looks incredibly rushed and made without passion. But it's always good to see Reeve in flying action."

        "review_detailed_main": "1. Overall Plot - 2/10 The plot for this movie is all over the place. At times it feels like there isn't even a story happening at all. The setup is absolutely terrible, and really just doesn't make sense. I do like how they brought Lex Luthor back, because he is the best Superman villain.\n\n2. Entertainment / Engagement - 2/10 The only thing that even kept me awake during this is that I barely remembered it. So it was like watching it for the first time. This movie is only an hour and a half long, but feels longer than that.\n\nThe story is also just kind of dumb, so it's hard to even care about what is going on.\n\n3. Emotion / Investment in Story - 1/10 Feels like there is nothing emotional in this movie. Other than it being interesting to see Superman get sick, and how he acts when he is sick.\n\nThe little amount of plot that there is, is nothing to even care about. The way that the story itself isn't really explained, or make sense doesn't help with this either.\n\n4. Theme and Depth of Story - 4/10 The theme of this one is that you can't force people to do things, or world peace. Another theme is greed. Greed will make some people do anything for money.\n\nThis movie isn't deep at all. Nothing really has any meaning to it, and the film kind of just goes through the motions.\n\n5. Characters - 5/10 I love how they brought back Lex Luthor. He is the best nemesis of Superman. Nuclear Man is just dumb, and they didn't really explain anything about how he was created. I like how they included another \"love interest\" for Clark. It gives a different perspective than what we've seen so far.\n\nLois Lane is just as if not more annoying in this one again. Clark Kent feels less like Clark in this. He just doesn't have the same Christopher Reeve flare to it.\n\nThey also decided to give Superman random extra powers again, like they did with the second film. And that's just dumb.\n\n6. Acting / Writing - 4/10 There really isn't any good actors in this. Even Christopher Reeve, who has been phenomenal in the other movies, just isn't very good in this one. Gene Hackman is also not as good as Luthor as he was in the past.\n\nBut besides Margot Kidder as Lois, none of the actors are terrible. Just not very good.\n\n7. Cinematography - 3/10 It almost feels like watching photoshop or a powerpoint. This movie feels older than the previous 3, which is just not good.\n\n8. Score - 5/10 The music in this doesn't even sound like a Superman film. They have the original theme a couple of times, but that's really it. Other than that, the music is boring and incredibly average.\n\n9. Editing / Pace - 1/10 It feels edited like a powerpoint.\n\nThe pacing is terrible. It is already a short movie, but feels too long. Because it's short they don't actually explain anything, it all kind of just happens.\n\n10. VFX/Practical Effects - 0/10 Literally looks like something a teenager would do in photoshop. I don't understand how it is the newest of the Christopher Reeve Superman films, but looks the worst.\n\nA lot of things, whenever objects move on screen, like Superman flying is just a 2D image being dragged across the screen. It's pretty laughable to be honest.\n\nAverage Score: 2.7/10\n\nMy Overall Rating and Final Thoughts: 2/10 This movie is bad. It just is. It really sucks that this is the last time we see Christopher Reeve as Superman. He was so legendary, and there hasn't been, and never will be a Superman and Clark Kent like his. I also found it funny how similar Megamind is to this movie. The plot is basically the same."

In order to see what the film should have been, I suggest one seek out the DC Comic Adaptation. This film, as Christopher Reeve's final performance as Superman deserves to be restored for DVD. The reason for Superman using powers he has never had, was the result of unfinished effects. The great wall of China scene should have been finished by adding Superman fixing the wall at super speed, and finished with Superman sealing it with heat vision."

They even used action figures in some scenes of nuclear man flying. This film is full of Plotholes. Like for example nuclear man requires sun to function, but one scene he goes in an elevator and guess what, he doesn't lose his powers! One major plot hole is when characters are in space, they don't have spacesuits on, but somehow survive, how did the studio not realise that plot hole. One stupid scene is when Superman repairs the Great Wall of china with a beam from his eyes, that's so unrealistic. Just avoid this movie altogether, it's a flawed waste of time."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is just awful. It tries too hard to be a message movie and it might have managed it if it was entertaining in some way. At least Superman 3 was genuinely hilarious at times (God Bless Richard Pryor, you know?).\n\nThe script is convulted. It staggers from plot point to plot point before the ending is quickly rushed. The budget for the moviebwas obviously slashed to nearly nothing for an action movie. Only 17 million which was less than half of the previous film. I feel for Christopher Reeves and Gene Hackman who both seem embarrassed to be involved in a movie of this quality.\n\nComic book movies weren't always a big deal. They definitely weren't before 20 years ago. Nowadays it's impossible to imagine a studio not pulling out all the stops to make a top notch comic book movie. The opposite was true here and the result is a very poor film. Think Batman and Robin for other dubious examples from last century."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well to say that the final chapter in the Superman series was a big let down is an understatement. I have read many people's opinion on this movie and agree that it could have been a way better film. Though the film's theme does have some merit attached to it.\n\nSuperman IV is about the man of steel grappling with his emotions of his now home planet, Earth. He is afraid the planet could suffer the same fate as his mother planet Krypton. Superman agrees to rid the planet of the threat of nuclear war. But the mastermind of the greatest criminal in the modern era, Lex Luthor, uses the Superman peace bid to create ciaos. His new creation is a Frankenstein like being, a Nuclear Man. Can Superman stop the Earth from blowing itself up?\n\nActors such as Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman were crazy when they agreed to do this film. I know that Reeve helped to write the story to this film, and the whole nuclear war theme was quite fine. But tell me if I am wrong, the big screen version never turned out the way it was suppose to? Reeve was good again as Clark Kent/Superman (but only when his feet were on the ground). The flying sequences in this Superman were atrocious. Scenes like when Lois Lane and Superman fly around together. These scenes look fake. The original Superman gave me the impression that this bloke really could fly. But this film makes a mockery of the Superman name. I must commend the speech of Superman to the world congress on nuclear war, it was quite touching and when you watch the movie up to this point, I thought hey this might be alright. But how wrong was I?\n\nGene Hackman made the role of Lex Luthor his own. Yet, I am amazed he even wanted anything to do with reprising the Luthor role. Not that he was bad, but the film itself was. Hackman since then, has had to reinvent himself in films like Enemy of the state, which I enjoyed immensely. It is only lucky he didn't ruin his whole career. Another of his better films was the Quick and the Dead, starring alongside Hollywood beauty Sharon Stone. Margot Kidder was back in Superman IV and I did enjoy parts of her in this. Lois' emotions towards Superman were well acted by Kidder. Looking at Kidder's career since this film nothing really stands out to me though. Margot has had bad luck in the last ten years, being in a serious car crash, managing maniac depression and requiring psychiatric care. I do remember that she went through a tough trot.\n\nI will tell you which cast members weren't quite that super. First of all, Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow). It is fine to have a menacing look about you, but aren't you suppose to able to act a bit also? Pillow was a terrible choice in this role. The other point is that I haven't seen or heard anything of this guy since. The other crappy part to his role was that Gene Hackman supplied the voice of his character. The Nuclear man character was ok, but could have had a better actor playing him. Then you have the attractive actress Mariel Hemingway, who played Lacy Warfield. The daughter of tycoon David Warfield (Sam Wanamaker). As good looking as Hemingway is, her character in this was of no importance at all. Likewise Wanamaker, who just makes up the numbers, plus the whole take over bid of the Daily Planet didn't make much sense to me. Last of all I want to talk about Jon Cryer. He played Luthor's nerdy nephew, Lenny. He was terrible and a complete waste of time being in this film in my view. I also read somewhere, has anyone seen Jon Cryer since Superman IV? My answer to that is yes, in a film titled Holy Man starring would you believe Eddie Murphy, Jeff Goldblum and the gorgeous Kelly Preston.\n\nI have mentioned some scenes in Superman IV that I liked and that I disliked. Another favourite was when Lacy and Lois had a double date with Clark and Superman. This scene was well acted and cleverly done. Superman was up and down this tall building for the entire scene. Reeve's talent's again shone through with this. The only problem with this scene was that it totally gives away who Superman's secret identity really is. Anyone in their right mind should know after having a double date with the guy. The worst scene in the film is when Nuclear man takes Lacy Warfield after falling in love with her. Superman discovers that Nuclear man's energy comes from the sun and shifts the moon's orbit to block the sun. Meanwhile Lacy is dragged into outer space. I don't know who got this wrong, but no earthling can breathe in space without help can they? So why didn't Lacy die huh?\n\nThe other dilemma this film had was that the budget was cut back. After a test screening, it was reduced from 134 to 90 minutes. I say that the edit button destroyed this film. Scenes were deleted or cut. It might (I stress might) have helped if I could have seen the whole film. I read the book to Superman IV and admit that I actually enjoyed reading it. I hope we get to see what was taken out of this film on the DVD of Superman IV.\n\nAll in all this was a movie which probably never had a chance to succeed. With poor special effects, ordinary cast and a shortened version that really did kill it. I want to wish Christopher Reeve all the best in his recovery from his quadriplegia. I will always remember him as Superman, on the big screen and in real life. I am afraid to say that this film gave Superman a bad name.\n\nRating: 2 out of 5 Stars or 4/10."

This is not true. Yes, for a human to fly in space, they would have to survive being burned up leaving Earth's atmosphere, then survive the vacuum of space (in other words, two people would have been dead by the end of the movie). However, let's revisit the 1978 original, in which the Man of Steel flies around the world, making it spin backwards, which also makes time reverse. If that really happened, every living thing and object on the planet's face would be flung off into the cold depths of space.\n\nI won't linger on this anymore. Yes, \"The Quest for Peace\" has unbearable dialogue (in places), but it's classic Superman-- the cheese, the cheap effects, and the general cartoon feel. Plus, it does have Jon Cryer, in what is oddly his best performance of all time (you'd better believe it), and a solid message people still need to think about. In other words, come to believe a man can fly, stay for the inherent message of the movie: we would have to be very stupid to nuke our own planet."

But Part 4 is just an awful film overall with few redeeming qualities. Reeve's admirable storyline works well, and the double date scene with Superman & Clark is very entertaining (similar to the style of Superman III). But it's when Superman IV tries to get serious and exciting in its action sequences that it fails miserably and becomes a cheesey, ridiculous farce that only succeeds in showing how pointless it was to make the film on such a small budget. The story's not bad and if Donner was directing and you had 100 million dollars you could do it now and create a great adventure movie with some classic comedy scenes and some exciting action sequences. But anyway, it's too late. For all its failings, every time you see it, it's still fairly watchable, mainly because you're always expecting it to magically be better this time around. It's not as bad as everyone makes out and far more creative and original on a 16 million budget than what Batman and Robin did with 100 million! If Batman and Robin's a 3 out of 10, then Superman IV's a 6 out of 10."

The movie could had certainly used some more humor and comical situations and characters.\n\nThe movie had still quite some potential to be honest but the weak directing and storytelling makes this a movie filled with holes and loose ends. Some moments are just completely unbelievable and there are more than a few obvious goofs in the movie and the story.\n\nIt's surprising to see that Gene Hackman actually agreed to return in this movie after his absence in \"Superman III\". Not even he can give the movie a fun and light feeling. His character is terribly underused in the movie and the real main villain of the movie (Nuclear Man) is only introduced towards the ending of the movie. Nuclear Man is a pretty decent villain but he is simply introduced too late in the movie to leave a lasting impression.\n\nNot even Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder seem to feel at ease in this movie. They were both great in the previous 3 Superman movies but they really don't seem to feel comfortable with this movie its script and dialog.\n\nThe special effects look absolutely horrible and are by far the worst of any of the Superman movies.\n\nYes, the movie does still have some entertainment value and it still has some good superhero elements in the movie but overall it's a movie not really worth watching. The directing and the script are weak and not even the normally fine actors can make the movie fun or believable enough. All that is left now is a silly, horrible mess.\n\n4/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

The other extras for the scene were brought over from the high school that was on the same RAF base.\n\nThe overall quality of this film pretty much stunk.

No wonder it killed the franchise for 19 years ('til Bryan Singer came to the rescue), it really sucks, sucks, sucks.\n\nThere's only one thing I enjoyed, and that's the late, great Christopher Reeve, whose incarnation of the Man of Steel was once again pitch-perfect. Sadly, everything else is a 90-minute disaster: from the dire script (it almost screams: \"Hey, nuclear weapons are a bad thing, you know?\", and it has some awful dialogue, such as \"You know what we can do with Superman's hair?\" \"A flying wig?\") to the far from exciting SFX scenes (the same flying shot is reused at least four (!) times), The Quest for Peace is even worse than Joel Schumacher's Batman & Robin, which at least tried to be decent (Schumacher himself admitted he wanted to make it less \"clownish\" than it turned out).\n\nAnd let's not (?) forget the villains: Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) is sidelined in favor of his obnoxious nephew (Richard Pryor, who was the bad guy in Superman III, had a bit more charm), and the \"frightening\" Nuclear Man (voiced, God knows why, by Hackman) is probably the most throwaway movie character I've seen to date.\n\nThe premise was interesting, but not even Christopher Reeve could completely prevent this movie from crash-landing rather than flying. Apart from the leading man, Superman IV is about as interesting as a flying wig.\n\n3,5/10"

This ends up back firing however since Lex Luthor after breaking out of prison attaches Superman's DNA onto one of the missiles which mutates into Nuclear Man who has the same powers of Superman and more. Superman must now stop him as well as the world's impending self destruction.\n\nNow to this movie's credit I do like the script of this movie better than Superman 3.\n\nFor starters I like the idea of Superman's inner struggle of whether or not to interfere with the ongoing tensions of war. I think it was an interesting idea even if it was a little too political.\n\nI also liked all the new characters they introduced in this movie like Clark's new love interest Lacy Warfield who makes for some really funny scenes with Clark Kent. Christopher Reeves is also once again perfect Superman.\n\nGene Hackman is also back as Lex Luthor and once again does a great job. Not only is he really funny but he also has a new sidekick called Lenny who's also hilarious. I also like the idea of Luthor cloning Superman which was also an interesting idea.\n\nUnfortunately everything else in the movie lets it down. Mostly because of the special effects which are horrible.\n\nThis was because unlike the 1st 3 Superman movies which all had a budget of 50 million dollars each, this movie Superman 4 had a budget of 17 million dollars and it shows.\n\nThe special effects in this movie just look awful and quite frankly unfinished.\n\nIn fact the whole movie in general just looks terrible with horrible camera angles and rushed action sequences no doubt caused by its poor budget.\n\nThe main villain Nuclear man is also a joke. Like I said the idea of cloning Superman was a good one but not only does he not look like Superman at all but he also looks ridiculous and ends up just roaring most of the time. He's more of a joke than a threat and he's not even from the comics.\n\nWhich makes no sense to me considering how many great rogues Superman has in the comics like Brainiac and Parasite. Why is it after Superman 2 they stopped using the villains from the comics?\n\nSo yeah this movie is terrible which again is a shame since it had a lot of good ideas. It's just a shame that this movie's slashed budget ruined everything.\n\nAs it stands this movie is an unpolished mess that should only be watched if you want a good laugh."

I used to watch it only to laugh at it, but it turned out later I wasn't watching it anymore to laugh. I love this movie. It's not as good as the other Superman movies in the series, but it is still good. I also used to say that Mark Pillow was horrible as Nuclear Man because of how corny he was. I was wrong. He is good as Nuclear Man because the way he is you would think you were reading a comic. Christopher Reeve of course is great as Superman and I enjoyed the acting of his co-stars. I complained about the special effects, but I read about how much trouble the filmmakers went through to get this movie finished. One thing though that still stands as something I dislike is one, the mistake in the end of having Nuclear Man fly Lacey Warfield up into space and two, the fight on the moon. There are some good moments in the moon fight, but Superman acts like a wimp in some parts and doesn't know how to fight. He stomps on Nuclear Man's foot, he takes Nuclear Man's head and brings it into his knee and he tries to kick(tap) Nuclear Man and it results in Nuclear Man throwing him. But one last thing about the scene that I love is how Superman walks over to the American flag and stands it back up. Great stuff. There are only plot holes in the movie because a lot of it was cut because of idiots in Orange County that didn't like it. Thanks to them we have a movie second rate to the original version. This could've been one of the best in the series. It is still very good though. If you want to collect Superman movies don't leave this one out."

        "review_detailed_main": "Despite its reputation as the worst of the Superman movies, Superman IV: The Quest For Peace is not. Despite the horrendous special effects and rushed ending, the film manages to still present itself with some respect.\n\nChristopher Reeves had proved in the three previous films his ability to convincingly play the role of Superman. With this film, he not only proves his abilities but this is, in many respects, his best performance in the role. His speeches during the film are a sign of this and his chemistry with all the other actors helps also. Reeves also does his best to sell the special effects sequences it is a shame he couldn't. Reeves is the films biggest saving grace and it's a shame this would be his last time in the role.\n\nGene Hackman also returns in the role of Lex Luthor and with brings him that character's with, charm, and silent menace. But somehow he seems to be out of place most of the time and serves as a drawback in many of his scenes. Mark McClure, Jackie Cooper and Margot Kidder all return in their roles. But unfortunately they are all under used and their appearances might as well be cameos.\n\nThe rest of the cast does a decent job. Mark Pillow does excellent in the role of Nuclear Man, Luthor's super powered creation. Pillow does the role so well that one wonders how much better eh might have been in the special effects had been better. Mariel Hemingway is a welcomed addition to the cast as a heiress who serves as an additional love interest for Clark Kent. The only major addition that doesn't fit is Jon Cryer who could easily be the single most annoying character to ever appear in a Superman movie.\n\nThe film's real drawback is its low budget values. While this doesn't affect the majority of sets, the Fortress of Solitude set in particular looks cheap when compared to the one found in previous films. The same can also be said of the Daily Planet set. The low budget would also hurt the film in the area a budget was needed most: special effects.\n\nThe previous films, for all their flaws, at least had decent special effects and mostly convincing flying sequences and this film has neither. The special effects are sub-par by virtually any standard and despite being made nearly a decade after the first movie the effects from the first movie are still more convincing. The truly horrific nature of this films effect sequences can be seen during the climactic battles between Superman and Nuclear Man. The added addition of new powers with bad special effects doesn't help either.\n\nThe other major problem is the pacing of the film. The first 50 minutes or so is sheer entertainment that's the set up the story of both Superman riding the world of nukes and Luthor's evil plan. The set up, however, is better then the execution of the ending, which is both rushed and disjointed. The subplots of Mariel Hemingway's character and the boy who inspired Superman's quest are both left unfinished for example. Whole scenes feel incomplete and the final battle is over far too quickly to be effective.\n\nBut the film does have a saving grace in its concept. The idea of taking Superman, the ultimate hero of America, and placing him into the timely situation of Cold War disarmament is a stroke of utter brilliance. The concept of Luthor and Nuclear Man added to it also serve as an interesting addition to the story and it makes for good entertainment when viewed in this context. But this concept is ruined by the rushed feeling of the ending. But one still has to give high marks to Christopher Reeves and the screenwriters for their concept.\n\nThe films does have another saving grace: its musical score. Like the Ken Thorne scores for II and III, Alexander Courage's score makes heavy use of the John Williams themes composed for the first film and is highly effective. The Courage adaptation never fails to use the Williams music to maximum effect and it's a shame that, at Courage's own request, it has yet to see release.\n\nDespite its flaws in special effects and editing, Superman IV has saving graces in Christopher Reeves, the rest of the cast, the music, and the timely nature of the story. While nowhere near as good as Superman The Movie or Superman II and while not as bad as Superman III, the film still serves its purpose and is your average Superman adventure."

I think Reeves is okay as Superman (a character I have no fondness for), but the humour that permeates this series is asinine and childish. So while I would admit that this film is astonishingly shoddy and stupid compared to the previous entries (or at least the first two films), I can't say that I like it any less than any of the other films. In fact, I probably enjoyed it a bit more, but that's not really to the film's credit. A lot can be made of the fact that this film's budget was cut by about 2/3 due to Cannon's financial difficulties, but although that really shows in the film's insanely shoddy effects work and poor subbing of London for New York City, you can't really argue that this would be a good film if the effects were better. This is a film where Superman seems surprised that an elevator won't hold someone with strength similar to his. This is a film where Superman pushes the moon out of orbit with no repercussions. To be fair, it's also a film where the comedic elements are just as idiotic if not worse that the previous films. I grant all that ... but somehow the fact that this film is clearly junk makes it's stupidity less egregious than the stupidity of the earlier big budget studio films."

        "review_detailed_main": "Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder and Gene Hackman return for the fourth and final Superman entry. Released in 1987 it's by no means a good film, it received universal hate upon release for cheap looking special effects, inconsistencies and plot holes. But over the years the film has gained cult status due to its cheesy dialogue, poor acting and far fetched plot making it enjoyable for all of the wrong reasons. It set the standard for bad superhero movies long before Batman & Robin was released.\n\nSuperman/Clark Kent still works for The Daily Planet newspaper but it has gone bankrupt and tabloid tycoon Petty White takes over. His seductive daughter becomes the new editor and takes a liking to the bumbling clumsy Clark Kent. Lois Lane gets jealous and it becomes a pointless love triangle which (like everything else) leads nowhere.\n\nAnyway, Superman wants to rid the world of it's nuclear weapons and so every country (including Russia...) decide to help him gather all of these weapons so he can launch them into the sun. Meanwhile with the help of his annoying punk nephew, Lex Luther escapes prison and in the most far fetched plan you'll ever see, he creates his own super villain known as Nuclear Man, complete with spandex and an 80's mullet.\n\nLogic is thrown out of the window with this one, Nuclear Man takes a human being into outer space and she survives just fine.... We know it's about an alien who can fly etc but a human in space... It's like a 3 year old wrote the script. There isn't an ounce of respect for the previous films or the comics, Superman IV feels like a spoof. The first two films had their goofy moments and they were never 100% grounded in reality but at least they made sense. This one is just a jumbled mess and it's like they made it up as they went along.\n\nIt would have been interesting to see Superman go up against these nuclear weapon obsessed countries. But instead they wanted to have multiple/unnecessary plot lines involving Lois Lane, Lex Luther and Nuclear Man all of which just ruin whatever potential the film ever had. There are a few tiny moments in the film which they could have further developed, but clearly the makers of this film were less concerned about quality and more concerned in milking this franchise for some easy money. Overall there is about 10 minutes of decent stuff in the movie, the rest is just a joke.\n\nThe film was doomed from day one, with budget cuts and numerous other production troubles making the final product laughably awful. Reeve and Kidder both did good jobs but it eventually ruined their careers. Gene Hackman clearly had the most fun, but most likely because he received a big pay cheque for his return. There were also so many scenes left on the cutting room floor and it's very noticeable, they basically released an incomplete film. It's stupid, illogical and just plain dumb."

You can tell that there was an enormous amount of content that was lazily edited out of the film from the hour and a half runtime and the fact that the plot kinda just shambles along. Story beats are introduced that either have no context whatsoever or are ignored and never brought to a conclusion. None of the actors give an ounce of effort. Hackman's enthusiasm is gone, and has terrible dialogue written for his character. Lex's nephew, Lenny (Jon Cryer) is a terrible stand-in for the character Otis from the first two movies. I would say that he's insufferable (which he is) but he's barely in the movie to begin with so he's more inconsequential. Reeve is just kind of there, and he even has some terribly delivered lines. The chemistry that he had with Margot Kidder's Lois Lane is either completely gone or just incredibly flimsy. The special effects are awful and incredibly cheap looking, even for 1987 standards. The score is little more than them replaying the original John William's theme over and over again. And Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow) is just one of the worst and most boring villains of all time. All plot points are nothing we haven't seen from the previous three films.\n\nThe only real saving grace is the fact that they somehow managed to cobble together most of the original cast that's stuck through all four of these movies for one last rodeo. But even that is a double edged sword as you see that this is the last whimper to recapture whatever magic they had from the first two movies.\n\nJust bad. Don't watch it. Watch any of the first three \"Superman\" movies over this. Watch \"Batman and Robin\" over this. Watch literally any other superhero movie ever made over this."

With a severed budget, uninspired dialogs, plot inconsistencies, dull special FX (especially when Superman is suspended by thin wires on the moon and when Lacy Warfield is in space without a breathing apparatus) and a ridiculous and laughably villain, how a Superman movie can be enjoyable ? As far as I'm concerned none of these problems can resolve its own.\n\nThe film is so much different from the previous installments, and I felt a little alienated and lost while watching it. However I liked some moments, the best ones were with the campy Nuclear Man who shouted more than he spoke (he looks more like an extravagant wrestler than a clone of Superman) The final line was very prophetic while being ironic, and I'm glad that Superman returns is far more better than this monumental farce...\n\nSteve Baillargeon"

It's successor, however, is completely and utterly irredeemable. The storyline is recycled and lethargic, and you can feel the lack of interest from the cast. Even at just 90 minutes long, the film is painfully slow-moving and feels like its never going to end.\n\nThe coup de grace of Superman IV is the introduction of Nuclear Man, who is, by some distance, the single worst villain I have ever seen in a movie. I simply don't have words to describe how awful this character is. Mark Pillow is either a comic genius or literally the worst actor of all-time.\n\nChristopher Reeve is a wonderful actor and one of my personal heroes. His book 'Still Me' is one of the most powerful things I have ever read and I have given copies to almost everyone I know. It pains me deeply to award one of his films the dreaded 1/10 but I have no choice. This movie is truly horrific and a blight on the reputation of everyone involved."

        "review_detailed_main": "The fourth film of the Superman(Christopher Reeve) saga has Superman pursuing a greater goal besides fighting for justice and romancing Lois Lane:eliminate the threat of Nuclear Arms on the World. This movie is one of my favorite Superman installments(after Superman 2).It has it all: a original plot( Superman's quest for peace), the return of Superman's arch nemesis, Lex Luthor(played remarkably by Gene Hackman), a super villain just as powerful as Superman, Nuclear Man( the fighting scenes between them are outstanding), and new changes like the Daily Planet becoming a tabloid news paper. I was surprised to hear that this movie flopped at the box office and it was very criticized by fans, critics and viewers.In my opinion this film sunk because its message was very controversial.Even more Superman ceased to be an American exclusivity and look forward to every nations interests. The opening scene when Superman help a group of Russian cosmonauts in space , wow in 1987, i can only assume the thoughts of many viewers back then.The movie even suggested that there was an economical angle concerning the nuclear arms race(mainly through Lex Luthor).From my point of view, the reason this film flopped is because it meddled in to Politics.For many people super heroes belong in comic books, facing fictional problems( like for instance, an alien invasion).However it's very illogic to assume that Superman with all that power wouldn't take a stand on serious issues like nuclear arms and relegate to minor issues like saving a cat stuck on a tree.Many people expressed their dislike on this movie by focusing on the special effects.But not the entire movie has lower grade special effects, in fact there are only a few scenes.My favorite scenes like Superman worldwide chase of nuclear man, Superman missile round up in space, birth of nuclear man, metropolis show down have very good special effects. Nevertheless this movie didn't make it and it could be added to the list of films that flopped because of the audiences subjectivity.Botton line, yeah i like Superman 4 and i recommend it to anyone that haven't seeing it. In the other hand if anyone wants to see a Superman movie that's really Bad, see Superman Returns, this movie really sucks, and the irony is that it has great special effects.As anyone can't see, special effects are just one of several elements to analyze in a movie."

        "review_title": "Nowhere near as bad as people seem to think",
        "review_detailed_main": "I have watched this recently (early 2011) on the Deluxe DVD \u2013 picked up very cheaply to complete my set \u2013 I think for the first time since it came out. As a teenager, I am sure I enjoyed it as a piece of typical escapism, but I have come back to it now \u2013 screening a season for myself of all five Superman films \u2013 aware that people seem to think it's an all-time turkey. Well I am here to say that this really isn't fair.\n\nAs with so many things, it's all a matter of context \u2013 yes, alongside a modern equivalent superhero sequel, e.g. The Dark Knight or any of the X-Men follow-ups, it's pretty dire. But then alongside a contemporary equivalent \u2013 say, Highlander II: The Quickening or Ghostbusters 2 \u2013 it's almost sublime! (But then compared to Highlander II, nuclear war sounds like a pleasant diversion.)\n\nAnyway, I am prepared to say that this is not even the worst Superman film! It's worthy of re-evaluation and it's genuinely worth seeing as part of the series.\n\nFirstly, it's VERY 1980s when you watch it now. Big-hair-tastic and shoulder-pad-mungous. But this is comparable to any other film from that era, such as Robocop or Working Girl. And yes, infamously there are some extremely dodgy effects in the mix \u2013 but some of them are actually very good. This odd contrast is not so different from the previous films in the series, especially the first from 1978. And remember that Ghostbusters \u2013 released the previous year and winning an Oscar for its effects, no less \u2013 has some risible shots when you look at it now.\n\nThe real problem with Superman IV is that it's clearly been compromised in the making, ultimately put together without all the footage the director had planned to shoot. The infamous budget slashing by the studio is obvious in various scenes. While, jarringly, elsewhere you can see the money up on screen \u2013 the result being an uneven whole that's sadly less than the sum of its parts.\n\nI shall have to check out the deleted scenes some time to see what potential was there. But as it is, there are so many plus points trying to save this film:\n\nGene Hackman is great as Lex Luthor again, with lots of good lines and villainous charm. he was shamefully wasted in Superman II, as was Kevin Spacey in this role in the turgid and unengaging Superman Returns. Hijacking the airwaves to lure Superman, Luthor signs off with V-for-victory signs and an ironic \"Peace!\" and I love the subsequent scene where he has his say/exercises his ego before our endlessly patient hero, constantly on the move and fixing himself a drink of champagne to toast the demise of his arch-enemy. (It's clear, too, that the film-makers decided to try to top his wonderful subterranean lair from the original film by having his new hideout a big Art Deco set for the top of Metropolis' equivalent of the Empire State Building.)\n\nThe rest of the returning cast all do a solid job and, of course, Christopher Reeve is excellent. As the clutzy Clark Kent, he mistimes his aerobics (so 80s again!) but slyly gets back at a bully, bumbles around the capable Margot Kidder's Lois Lane and compliments his new love interest on her dress \u2013 badly and only at Lois' prompting. And then, as the earnest Superman, wrestling with his conscience and making then-oh-so-valid points about the Cold War arms race and human frailties, he gives the film a weighty centre. A scene at the now deserted Kent farm is touching and there is even the revelation that, without his parents, he now seems to be in the habit of revealing his identity to Lois for some love and advice, then mind-wiping her (again) with a super-snog! She is not, it is strongly suggested, entirely unaware of this arrangement...\n\nLastly, Sidney J Furie is a very capable director and his work shines in certain scenes... while elsewhere you are left musing sadly on what might (should) have been. The double date is superbly handled \u2013 for example, there's a lovely shot where Clark quick-changes into Superman through a car parked outside revolving doors. And dare I say that the sequences where the 'Nuclear Man' goes on the rampage, around the world and then on the streets of Metropolis, are actually better handled, with more sense of scale and jeopardy than the three Kryptonian villains' not dissimilar activities in Superman II. Then there is the careful way Superman's famed all-American persona is, in this film (only, out of the five), balanced against a sense of him actually being an international figure, fluent in all languages and looking at the planet and the human race as one whole. In the opening scene we are presented with some Soviet cosmonauts who are shown to be 'just like you and me', neatly setting up the film's entire premise \u2013 which is eventually tied up with even the defeated Luthor asking an Eisenhower-quoting Superman if the Earth will be vapourised in WWIII and being told that, as always, the planet is \"on the brink with good fighting evil\".\n\nSo in conclusion: It's nowhere near as good as the original, epic Superman, nor does it work with anything like the brio of Superman III, which is pure entertainment in my book. But it scores over Superman II, which for me feels like it was too old-fashioned even upon its initial release and seems even more compromised in its mix of what works and what jars. While in last place I am afraid I must put the disappointingly wet and unimaginative Superman Returns."

The big reason is the effects are a major downgrade from the earlier entries and in the end only were able to get half the budget that was used in the previous entry. It is rather obvious and Christopher Reeve's ability to play Superman and John Williams' great score alone can not carry the picture.\n\nLex Luthor (Gene Hackman) is broken out of jail by his moronic nephew Lenny (Jon Cryer) so that he can create his own superhero or supervillain in Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow). Once the two face off you should be welcomed to a great cinema fight, but you must undergo and witness some brutal flying scenes and grade Z effects.\n\nReeve, Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal wrote the story, Konner & Rosenthal the screenplay, but it is interesting because I can tell there actually is a good movie somewhere inside it, just needed a bigger budget and perhaps more story. Supposedly there were multiple scenes shot that were not included in the final cut. As well Wes Craven was originally set to direct, but he and Reeve did not get along well and then Sidney J. Furie was brought on board to direct. Joining the cast for part 4 are Sam Wanamaker as tycoon David Warfield who owns The Daily Planet and his daughter Lacy played by Mariel Hemingway who has the hots for Clark."

This scene was the highlight of the film, along with the counsel of Krypton giving their opinion on the causality of interference, however that was made farcical by one of the talking heads final words, which was a repetition of an adjective I can't remember - It brought to mind the priest of the subconscious mind in Woody Allen's \"everything you want to know about sex...\" when he exclaims \"Blasphemyyyy\"\n\nAfter these scenes you're left with the odd touching or pathetic scene accompanied by somewhat apt music, although I thought the music in the quasi-revelatory Louis & Kent scene really missed the mark with the choice of music, which was foreboding instead of sentimental.\n\nI never thought I'd watch this film and far less likely I was to review it with atleast a degree of seriousness, but that's what I've done.\n\nIt's altogether dreary and forgettable but \"Eine Kleine Nachtmusik\" was whistled by Gene Hackman: An ode to Mozart and his genius."

        "review_detailed_main": "Run-of-the mill Superman outing with funny adventures , thrills and predictable comic-strip action . This time the Man of Steele endeavours to rid the world of nuclear weapons , thereby pitting himself against impressive forces : a groundbreaking Nuclear Power. This \"Superman, the quest for peace\" 1987 by Sidney J Furie boasts a good cast as Christopher Reeve, Sam Wanamaker, John Cryer , Gene Hackman, Margot Kidder, Marc Pillow. In the best hands, it is dangerous. In the hands of Lex Luthor, it is pure evil. This is Superman's greatest battle. And it is for all of us.\n\nAn amusing and thrilling follow-up in which Superman : Christopher Reeve falls temporarily in distress when is suddenly attacked by a superpower creation : Nuclear Man . As villainous nuclear-entrepreneur Lex Luthor attempts to defeat Superman via a mighty man . It results in some breathtaking and fun scenes in which Superman battles an incredible force . Along the way Superman romances his former flame Lois Lane : Margot Kidder as main role , and the big guy takes up a new girlfriend : Mariel Hemingway . Considered to be the most silly and the worst of the four Superman/Reeve main entries. As Reeve deserves credit for remaining true to role through four movies . The film is fast-moving, agreeable and amusing, including overwhelming action scenes apart from the expendable romantic interludes when Superman falls again for his old flame, being a charming piece of first-class entertainment , but sometimes downright dull third sequel . Funny and well-intentioned screenplay by Christopher Reeeve himself with a promising satiric start that is uneven developed through the movie, though providing a good sprinkly of sympathetic lines. The film contains thrills, abundant special effects, and noisy action that benefits from a wickest sense of humour and a joyous zing. However , special effects are dime-store quality and it appears that someone may have walked off with parts of the script . Fine cast with Christopher Reeve who is pretty good and excels in his fight against The Nuclear Man . As well as Gene Hackman in his usual role as ironical Lex Luthor , accompanied by his nephew John Cryer who's a true showman playing a crook and roguish boy , at his best. There are enough traditional as well as modern digital effects to satisfy the most avid Science Fiction and Fantasy fans . Along with two main starring : Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman , there are other secondaries delivering attractive interpretations, such as : William Hootkins , Jim Broadbent , Jackie Cooper , Robert Beatty , Marc McClure , Jon Cryer , Sam Wanamaker , Mark Pillow, Don Fellows and many others. Sparkling technicolor cinematography by Ernest Day lends the top-dressing to the proceedings . And, of course, catching soundtrack by Alexander Courage based on the great and prolific composer John Williams, including the classic leitmotif . The picture was regularly directed by Sidney J Furie , giving a lousy approach , only outstanding Reeve's characterization as Superman , but he cannot save this overwrought , overlong and embarrassing sequel .\n\nThis high-flying series about Superman produced by Alexander, Yla Salkind are as follows : Superman 1978 by Richard Donner with Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman, Ned Beatty, Jackie Cooper, Trevor Howard, Marlon Brando, Terence Stamp, Maria Schell, Marc McClure . Superman 2 , 1980, by Richard Lester with Reeve, Kidder, Terence Stamp, Sarah Douglas . Superman III by Richard Lester with Reeve, Richard Pryor , Annie Ross , Pamela Stephenson , Margot Kidder , Gene Hackman , Annette O'Toole . And in similar style Supergirl 1984 by Jeannot Szwarc with Helen Slater, Faye Dunaway, Peter Cook, Mia Farrow."

Well published financial muddling at production company level led to production troubles and massive budget cuts and what became Superman 4 runs for just 89 minutes including titles with 40 minutes left on the cutting room floor. What is on screen looks cheap with poor story telling and rotten special effects and the nuclear man story carries no punch it is simply tame and lame. As a fan of the original I remember well taking in the movie at my old local cinema and leaving bitterly disappointed I had not seen the movie since until I watched this blue ray and time had not improved any of it. Christopher Reeve does the best he can in the circumstances and the John Williams theme music is as good as ever but this is a very poor movie that audiences at the time mostly avoided and wisely for Superman 4 with it's pretentious quest for peace serves only as an example of how not to make a movie."

        "review_title": "A Superhero Film On Par With The SyFy Shark Movies",
        "review_detailed_main": "The release of Superman 4 had many negative repercussions on those involved. Firstly it bombed at the box office, making only 15 million of its already low 17 million budget back. Secondly, it is recognised as causing the death of the live action superman franchise until Bryan Singers Superman Returns in 2006. Christopher Reeve even recognised this film as the greatest failure of his career. Unfortunately all this is well founded as Superman 4 is amongst the worst superhero films due to the film getting almost everything wrong, short of having Super nipples. It tried to steer away from the comedy of the Lester Superman, but unfortunately had neither the drama nor action needed to do so.\n\nReeve had credit in this film as writing the story. However there is good reason why this was Reeves only film writing credit as with a story this poor there was never any chance of the film being a success. The films title is very literal in that Superman is on a quest for peace by attempting to get rid of all the nuclear weapons on earth by gathering them all up and hurling them in to the sun. Yes, the film uses the logic that nuclear weapons are the real cause of war and it has little to do with those who have the weapons.\n\nThroughout it really tries to rub it in the viewers face that nuclear weapons are bad, as demonstrated by the villain named Nuclear Man. He's created by Luthor when he puts Supermans DNA to one of the missiles that Superman is hurling into the sun. Through this Luthor harnesses the sun's nuclear energy to create him and attempts to destroy Superman. Why the film didn't just use one of the many already existing villains in the Superman Roster like Bizarro is simply to reflect the message of nuclear weapons. The problem is by trying to simplify the concept of nuclear war, the message isn't being fed to us as much as it's being forced down our throats. Beyond this I suspect that in the 80's people already had the knowledge that nuclear weapons were dangerous without the guidance of Superman.\n\nMixed with this are a lot of pointless subplots which get no focus and many of which don't even get a conclusion. For example a girl named Lacy falls in love with Clark Kent for no other reason than the script demands it. A lot of time is devoted to antics such as Clark having to juggle a double date with both Lois and her by switching between Clark and Superman. But at the end of the film then it just feels like the film forgets entirely about the sub plot. Partly this could be because there are many scenes in the original that were either cut or unreleased due to budget being cut from 36 million dollars to 17 million just before filming was about to begin. This meant they could not film some scenes and others were unusable leading to a gaping number of plot holes in the films.\n\nThese budget cuts also led to the film having awful special effects which are comparable to the special effects of films like Shark Attack 3. This is why throughout the film you'll see the same shot of superman flying several times as a way of cutting costs. These terrible effects lead to what I would have to call one of the worst fights in a superhero film with a mixture of the worst effects and the worst fight choreography I've seen in film. All they seem to do is throw each other and fly away. Mixed with this are some ridiculously over the top moments such as Superman repairing the Great Wall of China or putting back the statue of liberty.\n\nAll of this goes together to making this into the worst Superman movie. I can see why this film ended the franchise for so long as failed in almost every way from the script filled with plot holes, awful special effects and the lack of humour making it the worst of the Superman franchise by a long shot. Saying that, this film does fall under the \"so bad it's funny\" category as it's funny to see just how many major plot holes there are ranging from a woman breathing in space to Superman going from near dead to one scene to alive and well in the next. But based on the political message this film was trying to be it was most certainly a failure."

It was only 90 minutes long, making it the shortest live-action Superman film and that it had to rush through its third act.\n\nIt's a far cry from the heights of the first two films"

Instead, we get this film, ending Superman for good, doing better than Doomsday, and only 30 years after it we get other Superman movie, to you see how much damage this film did it to the character. The plot is okay, but is the development that gets all wrong.\n\nFirst of all, Christopher, Kidder and Hackman tries hard, their perfomances are good enough, even with the bad writing, Lex Luthor character becomes a clich\u00e9, the biggest criminal mind of our generation, I get it, and he gains another dumb goon, basically the character goes to nowhere. Lois Lane is another character that suffers from bad writing, at least they could let her and Super be together, Superman interfered in the course of humanity already, he could be with her as well. It started as it ended, no changes in the status quo.\n\nThe film started well, nuclear war, good moments, everythings okay, but after Nuclear Man everythings go downhill and would be a waste of time list all errors, believe me, it's a lot. The movie does not justice to Superman, he deserved more."

        "review_detailed_main": "Clark Kent/Superman (Christopher Reeve) is still having saving people lives in Metropolis and sometimes the whole world, when he is flying. In the time, when the nuclear war might still happen between the American and the Russians. The world is still never safe and people still lives in fear. But when a young boy named Jeremy (Damian McLawhorn) thinks that Superman could disarmed the whole entire nuclear war by writing an personal letter to the Daily Planet. Superman sees in the boy's point of the letter, he decides to talk to the United Nations for peace on earth. But things are slowly changing, when Superman's number one enemy Lux Luthor (Two Time Oscar-Winner:Gene Hackman) is having plans to kill Superman once and for all with the help of Luthor's nephew (Jon Cryer) by using a piece of Superman's hair by creating an super-clone named Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow). A super-clone so powerful that is radiation charged. Now Superman has to find ways to destroy Nuclear Man before he gets Lux Luthor.\n\nDirected by Sidney J. Furie (The Entity, Iron Eagle) made an amusing, intentionally campy if extremely cheap sequel to \"Superman\" films. This fourth movie was produced (sadly) by the king of low-budget pictures of the 1980's Cannon Films. Which Cannon Films were going down, when \"Superman 4\" was produced after they were involved with box office disappointments like \"Lifeforce\", \"Invaders from Mars remake\" and \"Over the Top\". Originally Warner Bros give Cannon Films $40 million to produced the fourth picture but they only used $17 million to make it. They used the rest of the $23 million by producing other movies sadly. Special Visual Effects of this one truly did hurter the movie, there's only a very few F/X sequences were good but not many to make it memorable like the first two films. Also \"Superman 4\" feels choppy at times, not everything is logical in the story. While many scenes hit the cutting room floor before it was release. If the producers or the director kept some of the scenes that make some sense in the story. The premise could have been much more.\n\nBut on the plus side, what i feel make \"Superman 4\" watchable is the good performances from the cast. Reeve is terrific as always in the title role. Hackman is a joy seeing him playing the villain. Margot Kidder as Lois Lane is also fun as well. I did like the new characters in the film played by Cryer as Luthor's nephew and Mariel Hemingway as Lucy Warfield. Which Hemingway plays the daughter of a billionaire tycoon who bought The Daily Planet and she also finds herself attractive to Clark character. Pillow isn't bad in his only film as the villain but when he speaks, it is unintentionally funny most of the time.\n\nDVD Version from the recent Deluxe Edition. DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an decent Dolby 2.0 Surround Sound. DVD includes an fascinating commentary by Mark Rosenthal (Star Trek 6:The Undiscovered Country, The Beverly Hillbilles, Stephen King's Sometimes They Come Back). Which the co-screenwriter of the film talks about how Cannon treated the production badly, why the special effects looks so lame comparing to the previous films, character developments and the scenes were deleted from the picture. DVD also includes Deleted Scenes from the work-print (Which some are fascinating) but they don't including some of the deleted footage what Rosenthal mention in the commentary and the original theatrical trailer.\n\n\"Superman 4:The Quest for Peace\" was a major box office flop in the summer of 1987. But it somehow find life on video and it's great entertainment for the kids. Reeve came up with the premise of this feature along with Rosenthal and Co-Screenwriter Lawerence Konner (The Jewel of the Nile, Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes, Mercury Rising). Which Reeve wasn't sure if he wanted to do another Superman film if Cannon Films will help produced one of Reeve's personal project called \"Street Smart\". Which that film was notable for Oscar-Nominated Supporting Performance by Oscar-Winner:Morgan Freeman as the violent pimp. But Reeve at the time, he felt he could make it up for the Superman 3. For his career at that time, it seems to make it much worse. But i think for me anyway, i felt \"Superman 4\" was improvement story-wise from the third film. Also nothing could top the villain Luthor as well, no matter what the screenwriter could come up with. Die Hard fans of the comic-books or the films might be more forgiving with this one. Joe-Dunton-Camera Scope (J-D-C Scope). (*** 1/2 out of *****)."

        "review_detailed_main": "When Superman IV comes to mind, one often thinks of the pain associated with its viewing. My friend and I, after being stranded on a remote island in Papua New Guinea decided to search for entertainment. Instead, we found the Superman Series.\n\nTo add a new effect we decided to view them in the opposite order (4,3,2,1). Strangely enough, special effects (which I will assume are supposed to evolve over time) improved (And Reeve's pot-belly appeared to vanish)! (By the way, to avoid embarrassment we watched them *very* late at night with curtains closed!)\n\nOne also finds themselves asking where are the \"actors\" now?\n\nPerhaps Gene Hackman managed to resurrect his career after his potentially career-crippling experience in this movie. However, that big angry man that would occasionally growl (I am still debating with a friend whether the growling was also dubbed!), yes, the man they call Mark Pillow.\n\nWhere is Mark Pillow now? After looking at his \"impressive\" filmography (QFP and some TV series (Alaska Kid)) one does seem to believe that QFP was in fact Career-Crippling.\n\nI have also had many a debate with a friend of mine regarding whether Pillow is constantly tormented by fellow workmates (don't try to tell me he is making his money by \"acting\"), friends (if he still has any!) and family (I won't be that cruel!) with infamous lines such as \"Where is the woman!\" and \"If you don't tell me, I will hurt people!\" (I know I would!) It is often debated as to whether he was proud of his role in such a pitiful film. We believe that he was thrown out of a bar and landed at the feet of the casting crew who felt sorry for this drunken nobody. I will assume that these people (like Margot Kidder) have been committed.\n\nUnfortunately Reeve dared fate with a second shot of the line \"Don't do it, the people.\" after his ear-to-ear smile in Superman II (My friend and I believe that he was daring the phantom zone villains to beat up the innocent citizens of Metropolis with the dangerous irregular movement of a bus!), however while not smiling (this time anyway!) My friend and I were forced to declare the line as a \"Poor Reeve Call\". Lines that we have always found useful in day-to-day life include \"Excuse me, I think your sitting in my seat!\" (II) ,\"Don't thank me, we're all part of the same team!\" (I),\"I won't let you down again!\" (II), \"Stop, that's enough, that's enough. You win, I'll take you to her!\" (IV), \"Give it up you'll never find her\" (IV) and \"Father, I failed!\" (II). If by now you think that we are the ones that should be committed, you are obviously taking these comments far too seriously. While being very accurate, they are humourous as well!\n\nSo far we haven't really commented on perhaps the most atrocious element of the movie (the special effects)! Ok, I will even accept Lacy Warfield's survival in outer space (and yes, even falling relatively downward!) I know perfectly well that these things can't possibly happen (but then again, \"Superman\" couldn't possibly exist either (sorry!)) It is fiction. However, they could have at least made it look as if it were happening. Even the special effects in the first Superman Movie were better and it was made nearly 10 years ago! I may be picky, but I would expect the effects to at least be on par with those in Superman I.\n\nMy friend and I were thinking of a wonderful parallel universe where an alternate ending to the second movie involves Superman being humanized again at the end of the movie so that he can pursue his relationship with Lois. This universe would be spared of the peril of a fourth Superman movie.\n\nHowever, perhaps it is advisable to look at why this \"movie\" was ever made. Reeve was not in the greatest financial position of his life and needed a movie that he would be guaranteed a lead role. Perhaps this was one of the infamous Tax write-off's. Needless to say, it was a mistake.\n\nDoomsday didn't kill Superman, this movie (Superman IV) did!"

Instead of just foiling super villains and saving the world as usual, the clowns at Golan-Globus decided to use the comic medium as a diatribe against nuclear weapons...for in Superman IV it's not dastardly super villains or cunning plots that are the real danger...it's just nukes.

That said, the way this film simplifies the ideas of war and international relations is completely ridiculous. Forget that the threat of mutually assured destruction may have actually helped to prevent conventional wars, and forget that without nuclear arsenals many nations on this planet would probably be under serious threat, Superman IV takes the approach that things would just be peachy if all the nukes were just destroyed. Who's going to make sure nobody builds more, and who is going to stop nations like Israel from being utterly squashed after Superman takes all the nukes away? Who really cares? The movies approach to this very serious issue is completely absurd, and serves as a lesson on what NOT to do with your super hero movie. It's morals are as confused as the idiots who green lighted this idea.\n\nWith that out of the way, there's plenty of other reasons to hate this film. The writing is laughable, the characters (namely Lenny Luthor) are annoying, and the special effects are horrendous. Unlike the first films, Superman IV over uses the same practical and green screen effects countless times. The movie's 'dumb' in the sense that science, once again, does anything the script demands. Humans breathing in space and Superman moving the moon out of orbit to fight nuclear man are just a couple examples of how childish this film gets. I can buy Superman's 'mind erasing kiss' or even him flying back in time if it's only happening once and a while, but in Superman IV every time I hear Luthor talk about how the sun is just a 'big bomb' or anything like this I just want to cringe.\n\n'Nuclear Man' seems like an interesting idea for a villain, but the way he's created and just about everything about him is hilariously bad. This villain looks like a surfer-dude in a bad, chopped up, power rangers costume. Thanks to bad special effects and terrible fighting choreography, the action sequences are about as boring as everything else about this film.\n\nIf you enjoyed Reeves' other Superman films but haven't seen this one yet, do yourself a favour and don't. It's shlock with very little redeeming value outside of it's own hilarious absurdity."

        "review_detailed_main": "As much as I hate to go with popular consensus, I must admit that it is quite accurate in the case of this film... it blows. It blows with the power of its title character's super-breath. Oh golly me, how it blows. Nuclear Man looks and sounds(apart from the fact that his lines being spoken in Gene Hackman's voice, for no apparent reason) like something out of one of the Conan movies. Superman defies logic and science(yes, I know... but he does it more in this one than in the two preceding it put together), as does the film. And worst is the moralizing. The plot is quite poor. This is most definitely a sequel... and one that shows signs of a series that should have had the plug pulled several films back(right after the first, some would say). The writing displays a general lack of creativity. Luthor is brought back... slightly louder and less charismatic this time. We are introduced to Lenny, portrayed by Jon Cryer. I, for one, did *not* need to see this man playing a teenager. He's much funnier in Hot Shots and on Two and a Half Men. And what was with the complete and utter waste of Jim Broadbent? The man hardly utters a word in this film, and his screen-time is so small, he could have been an extra. I haven't seen much of him, but even from that(BlackAdder and Moulin Rouge), I would gladly sign(or perhaps even start) a petition to legally change his name to Funny Man. The humor takes the leap out of the campiness of the previous effort, but the plunge in writing and directing keeps the audience consistently underwhelmed. The film is hardly dramatic... the action sequences dire and unengaging. The writing scrapes bottom so hard that it goes right through, with no stop in sight. How many different similarly-abled beings is Supes gonna fight before actually facing a villain we *know*(from the comics), other than Luthor? I realize that Lex is his arch-nemesis, but it's as if these writers have gone to extreme measures just to avoid doing what is arguably easy(simply hand-picking a villain already known), but also what the real fans want. How many decades of history does this character have? It shouldn't be difficult to find someone suitable. The writers of the old series of Batman films managed... four times, no less. Granted, they also managed to screw up basically every film but the first, but they did have the assistance of Joel Schumacher, a director without any sense of making a comic book come to life as a film. Back to this failure, sorry, film... the effects are worse than ever before. The budget is quite clearly to blame. The attempts at drama or comedy are usually cringe-worthy... as is the nature and heavy-handed delivery of the two messages. It just winds up sounding incredibly preachy. Yes, we get it... nuclear power is dangerous, newspapers should be about news, not making money. Now stop trying to be morally superior... that, incidentally, is *not* what movies are about. The acting is fine. All in all, this just really doesn't have anything to offer. If you want food for thought on either message, read up on it or watch a documentary about it. If you want to see a good(or even passable) superhero film, look elsewhere. Consult the fan-base for more info on which of the previous films in this series is better, or go with another hero(or check out Singer's vision, and hope that he gets to keep making them as long as he does as good as he has with the first). I recommend this to fans of admittedly bad movies, as that is the only way this has any value at all, and as a lesson in what *not* to do when making a good film, for directors-to-be. 1/10"

Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor is nothing more then a clownesque nobody assisted by his 'slick' greaser highschool nephew. Superman's nemesis 'Nuclear Man' -created from superman's DNA- turns out to be a 80s hair-metal Neanderthal in spandex who's lines of dialogue consist mainly of 'Arrrghh'. Compared to modern day superman this one looks like a pyjama wearing nerd with his over-sized red underwear on the outside with matching plastic boots. I'm sure he wouldn't draw any attention in a gay bar. They always say films are made in the cutting room but here the editor must have shaken his head and thought there was nothing to be saved. Don't get me started on the plot: christopher reeve co-wrote the story...probably when he was high on LSD or something. (Spoiler) At a certain point in the film superman gets rid of all the nukes in the world by plucking them out of the sky, gathering them in a giant ball and swinging them into the sun. Also people can breathe in space. This film is just a disaster of epic proportions and you really have to see it to believe it. I'm sure this is used in Film Schools around the world as reference material on how NOT to make a film."

The plot just had catalysts and moments that didn't make sense.\n\nThe film completely abandoned any character development from the previous films. Though I am not a fan of Margot Kidder's Lois Lane, the treatment of her character is ridiculous. The filmmakers took anything positive from the original two films and either forgot about them (Lois and Clark's relationship) or hyper-focused to the point of being distracting (Lex's scheming, the score, Superman's honesty).\n\nFrom the bag of missiles in space to the movement of the moon, you can't go 5 minutes without a laughable moment. The visuals are the poorest of the franchise and none of the action sequences are believable.\n\nSuperman IV: The Quest for Peace should never have been made.

        "review_detailed_main": "The years have conferred cruel nicknames upon it, Superman 4 F*ck's sake!, Superman IV: Rest In Peace, The one I didn't see and so on. In fact part 3's Annette O'Toole (Lana Lang) delivered its most devastating critique, remarking simply \"they made a forth one?\" Yes, these cine-bullies have rounded on the third Super-sequel like a whore to a City Trader's wallet and though the criticism should be immense, it isn't the horror some would tell you it is\u0085though it's pretty close.\n\nSo how did a movie that made $350M in domestic adjusted dollars do a Jaws, and spawn such a miserable third sequel? What was it about the year 1987, did someone kill all the best filmmakers that year? The Quest for Peace plays like a bloody knife in your husband's raincoat, suggesting we should be looking for bodies rather than apportioning blame. Blame is the game though so here we go \u2013 Having killed the secret of their success by firing Richard Donner and his script doctor Tom Mankewitcz, the Salkinds, those Icelandic imbeciles with next to no understanding of what made Superman work, had cocked up Superman III by turning it into a camp escapade with Richard Lester throwing the custard pies. Imagining that the audience had lost interest in Supes rather than hating what they'd done to him in the 1983 instalment, they soiled the suite further by inflicting Supergirl on an audience still licking its wounds. When that failed the sultans of Santa Clause: the Movie decided to get out of the super-business and sold the rights to Golan and Golbus, Hollywood moguls from, er, Israel, with all the creative zeal of a lobotomised organutang.\n\n1987 was a big year for the GG's as no-one referred to them on account of Golbus' rumoured resemblance to a horse. They were also making Masters of the Universe, another 'hot property' but the gruesome twosome were spreading themselves a little thin \u2013 in short, the money wasn't quite pouring in as they might like. With other projects requiring life support, these geniuses took much of the $40M Warners had given them for Superman and spent it\u0085on something else!!! Possibly on air fares to Israel. The logic is obvious \u2013 why would you need to spend money on a Superman movie? Its total lack of visual effects or international locations would make it ripe for downsizing. Thus as the Reeve was lured back in exchange for amongst other things, story input, the budget was halved and the result speaks for itself \u2013 on a shoestring? The crew on this one couldn't afford string\u0085or shoes.\n\nThe total and soul destroying shame of Superman IV is that it could and should have been a wonderful swansong for Reeve in the title role. His nuclear disarmament theme, much derided, was in fact an honourable stab at giving the man of steel a meaty, real world problem to solve as well as returning the series to the more serious tone of the first two films. Unfortunately the script has no intention of doing serious, generally veering from infantile to ridiculous. It's the kind of screenplay that says 'we're not getting paid enough here' (which they probably weren't) but worse, 'we don't give a stuff'. But poor though it is \u2013 little wit or character development to be found here, what really kills Superman IV is the aforementioned budget. Even at a truncated 86 minutes it's embarrassing to watch a movie which feels so amateurishly produced and poorly made. The visual effects are, for the most part, atrocious. They would have dated instantly; in fact much of the work could be bettered today using the most basic effects software available. Unfair perhaps but given the quality of SFX at this time, the lack of money spent on them is unforgivable. If anything is going to pull you out of a movie, no matter how good the story or likable the characters, its seeing the strings \u2013 in this case literally. Reeve as ever is impossible to dislike and makes the worst of it bearable but the sheer thriftiness of it, Milton Keanes doubling for New York for example (!), is enough to incite you to crush Golan's Globus' with extreme prejudice. From the rubble there's also a fairly decent score by John Williams and Star Trek's Alexander Courage but even there it sounds as though the budget didn't stretch to an orchestra, the music having a tinny, synthesised quality to it in places. Brutalised in production, murdered in the editing suite with over 40 minutes excised (but in sympathy to the editor he must have had plenty of unusable footage, much of which he'd reluctantly have to have locked into the final cut) this last Superman (not counting Returns as it doesn't count this) is an abject lesson in poor production management and how to slay a cash cow with utter unmitigated contempt. Christ, Reeve probably laughed harder on the day he was paralysed."

We have Warner Bros. to thank for that for selling the rights to Cannon Films who, instead of using the $40 million Warner Bros. gave them to produce the film, used only $17 million and used the rest of the money on their other projects. Next up we have (drumroll)... the numerous plot holes e.g. people being able to breathe in space without space suits. Did I miss something here? Thirdly, the editing. Oh my, that poor, poor editing. The cuts were so noticeable, I was wondering if I was watching a Daytime TV edit of a Horror movie. And finally, the acting. Wow. It was like something out of a school play (and a bad one at that). But, I suppose the actors did the best they could with the (truly atrocious) script.\n\nSuperman IV doesn't even classify as a \"so bad, it's good\" movie. At least not when you compare it to the highly superior first two.\n\nSome people have said that this movie is worse than Batman & Robin. Trust me, it is not. Not even close.

I never saw the movies as a kid, so thus have no nostalgic affections for them; I watched them all recently, and was shocked by the naivety of the plotting and inexcusably poor special effects work.\n\nI know the first two films are regarded by some as classics, but I find them twee and dated. The third film is indescribably bad, and indeed the nadir of the series; THE QUEST FOR PEACE is thankfully the final of the Superman movies, and the good news is that it's not as bad as the last one. It's still incredibly lame, though, and I have to say that I only found it mildly entertaining because I treated it as a comedy throughout.\n\nThe first half is dull, saddled with Reeve's grating slapstick as Clark Kent and Margot Kidder's own brand of screechy histrionics as Lois Lane. Gene Hackman is back and slumming it, although he's in it so infrequently that he doesn't fare as badly as the rest of the actors.\n\nThe second half is where it gets slightly amusing, presenting large scenes of mindless destruction perpetrated by the movie's erstwhile villain, Nuclear Man (possibly the cheesiest, campest villain in film history). Cue the Great Wall of China exploding and a mini disaster scenario involving an erupting volcano. The effects are awful, but it's all quite funny, although nobody in their right mind could describe this as a \"good\" film. Add in some heavy-handed lefty politicising (of the same variety as Seagal's ON DEADLY GROUND) and you have a film that's memorable for all the wrong reasons."

        "review_detailed_main": "The way \"Superman IV - The Quest for Peace\" is referred by critics and conventional wisdom is absolutely unfair. It is accused of killing Superman series, quitting Christopher Reeve's portrayals of the man of steel and delaying in two decades a new Superman film. Blame Cannon Films' budget constraints, not all the movie. Off course, \"Superman IV\" has flaws. Due to Cannon Films's bankruptcy, there was not enough money to resume properly an expensive movie like that (budget shrank from US$ 36 million to US$ 17 million). Therefore, special effects are much worse than the ones used in its prequels, and scenes have been filmed without appropriate conditions (scenario, extras etc). To summarize, the film has been released \"unfinished\", as one of the actors, Jon Cryer (yes, Alan from \"Two and a half men\"), stated. Besides that, they invented some powers which are not this superhero's traditional ones, such as telekinesis (though, a power General Zod had in \"Superman II\") or creating bricks with the X-ray (indeed, the Great Wall scene is particularly amateur). The super-villain Nuclear Man, although not visually bad, suffered with poor text and bad acting. I also disliked campy Lenny (22 years old Jon Cryer), Lex Luthor's nephew. Though, \"Superman IV\" also has merits, which should be acknowledged. First of all, its plot is interesting and not less sophisticated than most of superhero movies (not to confuse complexity with mess, as many recent superhero films have bad explained stories disguised as story richness). Besides that, there are many nice jokes, enjoyable situations and good dialogues. Once again, Christopher Reeve does an amazing job as Clark Kent and Superman, and Gene Hackman and Margot Kidder also have great performances in their roles of Luthor and Lois Lane. Instead of pure empty action, \"Superman IV\" also brings an important message of peace and criticizes both USA and USSR for their stupid military over-investments. This trait would have also been reinforced if some very nice deleted scenes had been included in final cut (they are available as special features in DVD, together with horrible footage with the first version of Nuclear Man). Besides that, the movie also reminds how the press is responsible for the outcomes of its reports. The final message is a praiseworthy support for political engagement. The bad fame of \"Superman IV\" has been so often sustained that people do not watch this film anymore, letting no chances for its reputation be reconsidered. That is a shame. It is worse than excellent Superman I and II, off course, and, in my opinion, also than \"Superman Returns\", but I consider it much better than campy \"Superman III\" and much truer to our dear character than revisionist Zack Snyder's \"Man of Steel\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "Let's just face it. The first two films were good, the third was very awkward and this film is a time-waster! Hehe. Talk about an enemy named Nuclear Man (I thought he should be called \"Zuperman\" simply because hiss N looked like a Z), who's simply a rip-off of Superman...just on the nuclear side that is. The story is the most pathetic Superman story of all...in any form no less. Some scenes are totally unrealistic like when Nuclear Man had a woman hostage and went to outer space...you should see how unrealistic it is. Gene Hackman's back but his performance is nowhere near his past Superman performance...too bad because his presence went to waste with this blasted film. Christopher Reeve had his last Superman performance which is good because in this film he lost some of his Superman appeal and act and his age back then was related to that.\n\nSuperman IV came out at a time when nuclear arms where a big issue (well...it still is today) and having Superman rid the world of them seemed like an interesting idea and a chance to show off Superman as a role model for the world. Well, seeing Superman gather those nukes and toss them at the sun was simply...very awkward and corny.\n\nIt's just too bad that the Superman series of movies ended very badly with this blasted film. Heck, this one should have never been made."

        "review_detailed_main": "Simply put that is how I describe this one. None of the Supermans are really great, but they are ok. This one is just awful...I mean where do I begin. I might as well start with the budget...It just had to be extremely low. His flying looked worse in this than in the first one. Then there is the acting Reeve goes beyond mediocre in this one...here he sucks. I am guessing it was the director's job that made him tolerable in the first three. Not that anyone does a good job in this one including Gene Hackman who is also awful and just why did the feel the need to have Jon Cryer play his nephew? Then the scientific errors. Somehow a strand of Superman's hair can hold up all this weight...I think it was a ton, but Lex Luthor cuts it with bolt cutters. Nuclear man takes a girl into space where there is plenty of air for her to breath apparently. And speaking of the villan, did they try to make him as lame as possible or what. This of course has to do with the plot, a whole movie devoted to telling us a nuclear war would be bad...Duh! If Reeve thought this movie was going to cause world leaders to say \"Gee, we shouldn't start a war and maybe we should disarm\", then he was fooling himself."

        "review_detailed_main": "(This review contains potential spoilers)\n\nI'm probably being generous with 3 stars, but for the first 45 minutes or so, Superman IV isn't a bad little film. Granted, it's instantly obvious the budget is a fraction of what had been used for the first 3 films, and Luthor's nephew is a terrible 80s teen \"dude!\" stereotype. But the opening sequences with Clark visiting the old farm in Smallville and the return of Margot Kidder's Lois Lane are both welcome. Mariel Hemingway provides a sexy third side to the film's romantic triangle ... but it could be argued a film like this didn't need that.\n\nIt had been 10 years since the first Superman was filmed, and this gives the regular actors added depth as they played their familiar roles. Gene Hackman is an exception, playing Luthor a bit too low key for the character's own good.\n\nAt about the 45-50 minutes mark, things start to collapse as the close-to-an-hour's worth of deleted scenes begin to take their toll on the film -- for example, suddenly Clark looks all grey-haired and dying with no real reason given. And while the battle between Superman and Nuclear Man is clearly inspired by the comic books -- and would have worked well in the comics -- in live action, it just comes off as silly. And when the filmmakers abandon any pretense to reality (by, among other things, having a human character survive hanging around in the vacuum of space) the film just falls apart.\n\nThe film is worth seeing, though, for the byplay between Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder. It's a pity the opportunity was lost in Superman III to expand on this more when Kidder was written out of the film.\n\nBut, as the fourth entry in a franchise that began with the spectacular Superman I and Superman II, this film is an extreme disappointment -- though, at the same time, it's one of those films that seems ripe for the remastering/directors edition/upgrading routine that has been done with other films."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I decided to see this movie, I already knew what I was going to find, and I wasn't surprised by how bad and incredibly amateur it is. For me, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen: history is a jumble of ideas with no logical connection or clear sense, predictable, boring. It begins with an escalation in the nuclear arms race, deftly and promptly resolved by the hero in an absolutely unbelievable way, and then revolves into a rivalry between him and a villain that Lex Luthor creates virtually out of nowhere, since the bombs were destroyed. There are holes almost the size of houses in this silly plot, and the movie really does look like it was made of pieces from various stories sewn together like a patchwork quilt. It's better not to mention the romantic subplot in the film...\n\nThe cast's performance doesn't help to save it. There is virtually not a single actor or actress who deserves a positive standout. It's not just their fault, but also the hideous script, the undignified material they were given and the atrocious incompetence of director Sidney Furie, who turned out to be so good that it would have been better to make the film without a director at all. Christopher Reeve also deserves a negative note, with a smug, pompous and irritating performance that is an indelible stain on his acting career.\n\nTechnically, the movie is more than just old... it's archaic, primitive and has aged terribly. The visual and special effects used are so unacceptably far-fetched that they simply shouldn't have been used. They almost turned it into a B-movie. And is it really worth talking about a cinematography without any depth, with bad light and washed-out colors? Perhaps the best thing, really, is to forget about this movie and use the VHS to patch up a limp table."

Some of the effects are among the worst ever displayed in a major motion picture. The script is chopped up so bad that some scenes wind up being incoherent. One saving grace is the sincerity of the performances. Christopher Reeve is still a believable Superman/Clark Kent, while Gene Hackman makes a pleasing return to the series as Lex Luthor. It should either have just dealt with nuclear arms or the solar powered villain, not both. The zany subplot with Mariel Hemingway falling for Clark is mildly amusing.\n\nI have heard/read a great deal concerning cut scenes and a grossly cut budget. Why did they do that to Superman? Didn't the producers know that fans wanted to see a worthy movie, not a cheap imitation?\n\nThe real problem was that the Salkinds left after #3, leaving the filmmakers with cheap producers, and not choosing a better director than Sydney J. Furie.\n\nAt least #3 had entertaining elements, even if it did throw out the Lois Lane character and any trace of the previous two movies. I liked the sweetness of the Smallville scenes and the humor provided by Richard Pryor; I even liked some of the special effects sequences. But #4 is virtually a child's wind-up toy. Reeve had good intentions with his input as co-writer and 2nd unit director, I'm sure. He remains true to character.\n\nIt should have been better. * *"

        "review_detailed_main": "Oh the potential this movie had, Christopher Reeve and the original cast from the first two films were truly behind this one but alas that could not make up for the lack of budget and shoddy script. Poor visual effects aside, this movie is just hastily cobbled together from a few half-baked ideas that aren't fully realised, with the character motivations and the way certain plot points come to fruition not making a lick of sense.\n\nI understand that 45 or so minutes of this film were left on the cutting room floor, but having both watched the deleted scenes and read the original script for the movie, I have to say that even if all of the footage had been left in this movie would still have been a mess. I appreciate the idea of a scenario where an omnipotent superhero is put against a real world crisis but the way it plays out here doesn't do the premise justice, I would have much preferred it if the world authorities were resistant to Superman's plan for worldwide disarmament and were inadvertently united in the cause to prevent his interference, but instead there is no challenge, no moral panic, no humanity, it is just bear bones bad writing. Even so I have to say that Christopher Reeve's decision to focus the film on an overt anti-nuclear war message was a mistake from the start, not to mention it instantly dates the film and makes it come across as pretentious and trying too hard to educate rather than entertain.\n\nYes the effects are terrible, yes the lack of money shows in almost every frame, yes the film would have been better if certain scenes were left in, but despite this every problem with the film boils down to the script. A competent writer would adapt a script to better suit a reduced budget, and while it may make sense to keep the original scale of the story if the budget was cut shortly before filming but in this case the budget was cut over a year before production started! And when that happens it is the responsibility of the writer to change the story so that the scale is less important, but rather the characters and morals are the focus. This happened with Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, the budget was severely reduced and so the director rewrote it to focus more on the characters and less on the action, and that film turned out wonderfully, why didn't that happen here?! The film is a sad end to an otherwise classic (or half classic) movie saga and unfortunately leaves Christopher Reeve, the definitive man of steel, in a bad light. While the film perhaps tops Superman III for good intentions and being a guilty pleasure, it's far from the film it should have been."

With that being said, why can't I stop watching it and talking about it. It is the only (1/10) movie that I have watched 8 times.\n\nMost bad movies are mostly forgettable. It comes in, fails at its job, and goes on its way. This movie transcends that trend. It is SO bad it is unforgettable.\n\nUnlike a similar bad fourth entry, \"Batman and Robin\", this movie has the benefit of having the original good actors found in the good movies. That makes this film feel more legitimate. It feels like a Bizzaro version of the Superman movies that are just awful.\n\nEach scene gives you a new thing to make fun of, a new instance to ask: \"What were they thinking?\" The special effects are so much worse than the effects of the 70's. Cannon productions had these \"so bad they're good\" movies down to a science.\n\nI could go through scene by scene and describe the ludicrous story this movie tries to tell. It has about 12 side stories going on at the same time. The Daily Planet gets new management. Lacy Warfield has a crush on Clark Kent. Superman throws all the world's nukes at the sun. Lex Luthor breaks out of jail. Lex creates Nuclear Man to fight Superman. Little kid Jeremy is upset about the cold war.\n\nI will not try to sum up the story of this film, it simply must be seen to be believed. It is beyond bad; it is SUPER BAD."

Watching it just made me feel sad, mainly due to the aforementioned cast, and everything about it feeling so half-hearted.\n\nI'll annoy some people with this opinion, but I think The Cannon Group sucked and low-key deserved to go out of business (Runaway Train is good, but that's about it). Much of what they touched turned to ****. I can't believe Superman IV seems to have more defenders than III. At least that one felt like a proper movie during its better moments, even if it's missteps hold it back from being genuinely good overall. By comparison, IV is scrappy, cheap, lazy, and feels unfinished."

Even with the low budget it had to work with, I think a good director could have pulled off a more successful film! We have three \"Superman saves Lois Lane\" scenes, in the first film we have the helicopter scene which was edge of your seat suspense! and an awesome special effects scene in the pre-CGI era. The Eiffel tower scene in Superman II, almost as awesome! another edge of your seat suspensor, then we come to Superman IV, the Subway train scene, which I almost fell asleep through! come on Sydney! what were you thinking? If Richard Donner had made this film, it would have soared! The subway scene could have been suspenseful even on the low budget the crew was given to work with!\n\nSo, you ask, why are you giving this film four out of ten stars? Because of the story, the performances of Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman and the over all fact that I was glad to see another Superman Movie! The ideas that went into this movie were great! Superman tries to save humanity from itself! Perry White looses the Daily Planet to a competitor! Superman fights a villain created from his own DNA! If the filmmakers had anywhere near the passion for this material that went into the first two films then it would have been a very entertaining Superman movie! and it may have been the first Superman film to break 200 Million at the Box Office! But, it was not to be! I was hoping that there would be five Christopher Reeve Superman films and this film, sealed that fate! I have seen the new Brandon Routh Superman and I feel that the new filmmakers have a passion for the material, but the films story is weak! The special effects were top-notch and the cast is great! But I think the story ideas for Superman IV are actually better then the story ideas that went into Superman Returns! (However, it's good to see a Superman film in the hot 100 selling films of all time again). I would like to get all the film shot for Superman IV and find the special effects team for Superman Returns and get them to take out the bad special effects and re-do the Special Effects through CGI! How much would this cost anyway?"

It COULD be better, and iam sure that in its entirety with the previously unseen footage in the 134 minute cut of the movie, it would be good. As it is i must judge a patchwork movie. That is the main problem, the movie is badly operated on. Forget the special effects, they work nicely and arent as bad as people and critics will have you believe, we have seen worse. The direction by Sidney J Furie and presumably Christopher Reeve is at best good. The acting by the regulars and fun performances from John Cryer as Lex's nephew and Mariel Hemingway as Lacey Warfield [the love interest] are acceptable [certainly no worse than in any other sci=fi/action movie. And the plot, which has Superman fending off Nuclear arms from the worlds powers and defeating Luthors evil Nuclearman in the process is quite an exciting tale. The problem is that the movie is cut to ribbons. We see about fifteen minutes of what looks like Gene Hackmans best performance as Lex Luther, and Christopher Reeve's character comes over as vey wooden because we miss out alot of his characters development. As an 89 minute movie, Superman : The Quest For Peace is very lukewarm. As a 134minute movie, it looks to be alot better. Those of you who can get the extended version released, you know who you are.

Bursting onto the silver screen once again in \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,\" Christopher Reeve dons the iconic cape and red boots, delivering a captivating performance that reminds us why he is the embodiment of the Man of Steel.\n\nThis movie, often underappreciated by critics, possesses an undeniable charm that resonates with true Superman fans. Regardless of its flaws, the mere continuation of the story of the Last Son of Krypton fills our hearts with excitement and nostalgia, transporting us back to a time when superhero movies were still finding their footing.\n\nChristopher Reeve's return as Superman is nothing short of remarkable. With his chiseled jawline and commanding presence, Reeve flawlessly embodies the essence of the superhero we all know and love. He instills a sense of hope and righteousness in every scene, demonstrating why Superman is the greatest superhero that ever graced the pages of comic books.\n\nIn \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,\" our beloved hero faces a monumental challenge-an ambitious quest to rid the world of nuclear weapons. While some may scoff at the premise as idealistic or cheesy, it is precisely the unwavering optimism and faith in humanity that makes Superman such an endearing character.\n\nThe movie tackles weighty themes, highlighting the dangers of nuclear proliferation and the desperate need for global peace. It encourages us to reflect upon our own actions and the potential consequences they bear, reminding us that even the smallest gestures can make a significant impact.\n\nOne of the movie's standout moments is the confrontation between Superman and Nuclear Man, a formidable adversary created through scientific means. The intense battle sequences showcase the visual effects of the time, adding a touch of spectacle to the story. Although the special effects may appear dated to modern audiences, they retain a certain charm that transports us back to the '80s, capturing the era's spirit.\n\nIt would be remiss not to mention the heartfelt chemistry between Christopher Reeve's Superman and Margot Kidder's Lois Lane. Their timeless on-screen romance adds a touch of vulnerability and humanity to the superhero narrative. Kidder's portrayal of Lois Lane exudes determination and intelligence, complementing Reeve's noble and selfless Superman.\n\nWhile \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\" may not have reached the critical acclaim of its predecessors, it remains a worthy addition to the Superman saga. It rekindles the flame of hope, reminding us of the power of goodness and the potential for change that resides within us all.\n\nNo matter what critics may say, any movie or TV series that continues the story of Superman is undeniably \"super.\" Christopher Reeve's embodiment of the Man of Steel remains unparalleled, etching his name in the annals of superhero cinema. So slip into your Super suit, join the adventure, and embrace the nostalgia that \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\" offers-the world needs Superman now more than ever."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is the fourth and final Superman film with Christopher Reeve taking on the role, where he tries to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and battles Lex Luther (Gene Hackman) and his super-powered sidekick, Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow).\n\nThough the level of excitement and intrigue of this film doesn't match the first two, it is almost on par with the third and is still fun and fast-paced with neat special effects that showcase Superman's powers and great action scenes, something that sorely lacks in Superman Returns.\n\nThe nuclear weapons plot I thought was clever and unique to a Superman movie. Total disarmament of nuclear weapons may not be feasible in the real world, but Superman's quest for peace among all countries is well-intended in the film. Reeve is great as Superman and Gene Hackman gave us another thrilling performance as super villain Lex Luther. In addition, the fight scenes between Nuclear Man and Superman were awesome - Nuclear Man looked like a force to be reckon with as he possessed the same level of powers and same physique as Superman.\n\nOverall, I think this film is a fitting ending to the Christopher Reeve saga.\n\nGrade B-"

I came onto the IMDb to see how high they were rated (I wanted to know more about them, as they no longer sold them in Australia, and I had pretty much no way of watching them)... Superman III = 4.5 Superman IV: The Quest For Peace = 3.2 For a couple of months, I kind of avoided seeing them, afraid that they would ruin the first two movies. One night I got home from work to see that Superman III was on television. I stepped in just as Clark opened the door of his car, and hit Richard Pryor, and he gasped in pain. I saw the rest of the movie and thought it OKAY. Months and months later (Up until the point when I couldn't remember a single word of Superman III), I bought the Ultmate Superman Collection, and sat down and watched Superman III. It got pretty boring. I just zoned out of the movie. Then I saw Superman IV. I thought it was a lot more enjoyable (Probably because Margot Kidder had a lot more screen time). So All in all, an Okay movie to watch, if you have nothing to do."

C'mon...\n\nHere's whats wrong with this movie: The special effects budget was cut in half right before filming, that's why the effects look so terrible. The movie was way too short, it feels very hasty, especially when you compare it to the first two films. I've seen the deleted scenes and i really have to say it's a good thing they were left out. Nuclear Man #1 is horrible. He's not menacing or scary, he looks stupid. Like a failed incarnation of some silly Frankenstein film.\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes i have ever seen in a movie is one made in this film. Nuclear man 2 takes Lacy (a human with no superpowers whatsoever) into space. She doesn't freeze, hell she even breathes!! I don't know what the director was thinking.. This is careless film-making.\n\nBut let's not just focus on the negative side. The movie also has a few good things. The original cast returned (Margot Kidder as Lois, Jackie Cooper as Perry White, Gene Hackman once again as Lex Luthor and of course, our hero, Christopher Reeve returning as Superman). The fight scenes were very cool but looked bad because of the horrible special effects. If you can ignore the bad stuff i mentioned above, it's still a fun film to watch.\n\n5/10"

This is the only one of the 4 Superman movies where you can actually see his cables holding him up.\n\nthe only thing worst than the special effects was the laughable script. C'mon...I could not believe my eyes when superman and Nuclear man were carrying Mariel Hemmingway around in outer space with no space suit on her (and yet she is okay)...not to mention the cartoonish action sequences (like the one where Superman stops a volcano by cutting a mountain in half with his X-ray/heat vision and plugs the top half of the mountain into volcano's mouth....which in reality would have only created more volcanic back pressure and would have only caused a much larger more violent eruption)\n\nhow did this franchise get here. the first 2 films were standard setters..true classics in their own time, and although the 3rd film isn't in the same class as the first 2, the 3rd film is still very good..but Superman 4 leaves you scratching you head and asking yourself WHAT HAPPENED?"

There were so many scenes where platforms, wires, rewinding of film, and frame skipping were clearly evident. The first scene for example, when the cosmonaut got his head chopped off and in the next scene his head was back in place. The mistakes of this movie were unforgivable.It was just a horrible movie in which they didn't care how crappy they made it, just as long as they did and people saw it because of the superman pedigree. It was so horribly bad and had so many plot holes it resembled swiss cheese.\n\nWith that being said, this is what made it entertaining. No matter how much this movie raises my ire I have to admit it was wonderfully entertaining and i recommend renting the movie so you can find all of the errors, similar to a where's waldo book (replacing waldo with errors). Even after saying that positive remark, i am led to assume this was the most poorly made superhero film, but at the same time manages to be one of the most entertaining."

        "review_detailed_main": "The cinematic tour de force that is \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\", a film that ascends to such extraordinary heights of haphazard storytelling and dubious special effects that it quite literally redefines superhero film-making. And by redefines, I mean, makes one long for the comparative realism of seeing pigs fly.\n\nIn this 1987 gem, Christopher Reeve dons the cape and tights once more as our beloved Man of Steel, intent on saving the world not just from the sinister machinations of Lex Luthor (a delightfully over-the-top Gene Hackman), but also from nuclear war. A commendable ambition, you might think. But it's in the 'how' of it that things go spectacularly awry.\n\nThe plot dives fearlessly into the deep end of a comic book logic pool, with no lifeguard on duty. From the creation of Nuclear Man, a villain seemingly birthed from a sun-soaked nuclear device and a strand of Superman's DNA-laden hair, to the casual repositioning of the Moon, the film boldly throws science and logic to the wind, soaring high on the thermals of sheer absurdity.\n\nOne must give a standing ovation to Nuclear Man, the solar-powered, radioactive nemesis of our hero. Complete with a roar that sounds suspiciously like a domestic cat, and a punk-rocker look (glowing, retractable fingernails included), Nuclear Man certainly leaves an impression - mostly one of bewilderment.\n\nThe true villain of the piece, however, might just be the film's budget, which clearly kryptonite-blasted the special effects. Observe the eerily static background as Superman takes flight, or the repeat 'rescue' sequences, a brilliant exercise in d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. But the piece de resistance must be Superman's wall rebuilding vision, a trick previously unnoticed in the superhero's portfolio of powers.\n\nThe performances are commendably earnest amidst the chaos. Reeve remains dedicated to the role of Superman, carrying each preposterous plot twist with a straight face, while Hackman seems to revel in the role of the scheming Luthor, proving once again that a great actor can make even the silliest lines sound somehow compelling.\n\nIn essence, \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\" is a daring display of fantastical storylines, unintentional hilarity, and spectacularly underwhelming special effects. It's a glorious mess, a trashy treasure, a... well, you get the idea. It's a movie that teaches us that even Superman can have an off day, but that doesn't mean we can't enjoy the ride. Fasten your seat belts, suspend your disbelief (and perhaps your critical faculties), and prepare for a Superman adventure that's less 'Up, up and away' and more 'Oh, my and hooray'. This, dear reader, is a quest you won't forget!"

        "review_detailed_main": "My film knowledge is clearly wanting, because I found out only yesterday that Milton Keynes doubled Metropolis during the making of Superman IV: The Quest for Peace - a fact which alone sums up the scope, ambition and grandeur of Sidney J Furies's nail in the Man of Steel's cinematic coffin for almost twenty years. Looking back, it's so apparent what different an age these Superman movies lived in, a 1980's where comic-book movies were seen as disposable fluff, certainly not keeping up with the tide of seminal graphic novels that only now is cinema truly catching up with. The Quest for Peace is very close to being an outright abomination, saved primarily by the goodwill radiating from the whole thing... saved not enough, mind you, to prevent rendering it as possibly the worst comic-book movie ever made, or certainly close to its pure nadir.\n\nYou could cite a million problems. Story. Script. Production. Casting. It's pretty much got the lot, which in itself is an achievement. The low budget means Furie has to shoot in wholly unrepresentative locations that are so far away from the classy glamour of the first movie it's unreal, while ironically given Hollywood was on the verge of CGI breakthroughs around this time, the effects are the shoddiest of all four movies; the story starts in earnest fashion, with the interesting notion of Superman being called upon to interject in a nuclear arms race (though given, at this point, America & Russia were practically bowling buddies, it's not exactly razor sharp political commentary) utterly shattered when it descends (after a bizarre sequence where Supes throws ALL the nukes INTO THE SUN - surely that's a terrible idea, scientists?) into yet another dumb Lex Luthor farce of a plan and introduces the most laughable antagonist in comic-book history... NUCLEAR MAN! Oooooh! Run from his poodle perm! Hide from the daft lycra suit somehow created by the mad Frankenstein physics that creates him! Duck when he swipes you with his long, trimmed nails! I genuinely am not exaggerating about this guy... seriously, if he'd been accompanied throughout by Pepsi & Shirley, they would not have seemed out of place. In a way, he's brilliant for comedy - you try and fathom WHY he picks up the Statue of Liberty and decides to lob it down on a New York street. Good luck with that. He's just... amazingly awful, and once he turns up it just descends into the worst battle for supremacy you're ever likely to see on film. Poor Gene Hackman - he should have carved a comic-book legacy as Luthor, sadly he may just be remembered for all the wrong reasons when it comes to these films... I just hope he got paid well, frankly.\n\nIs it all bad? Well... yes. Almost. I feel most sorry for Christopher Reeve - what a way to exit his most iconic role, though admittedly he didn't necessarily know it'd be his last, but he must have known this was garbage. He does gamely well, in fairness, as charming and effortless as ever, and way above the material. Ditto Margot Kidder, reinstated properly here as Lois Lane, who gives possibly her sleekest & most assured performance in the role, again despite working with detritus (and having to share too much screen time with Mariel Hemingway's wet lettuce love rival). Those two just--just--make watching this worthwhile but only, truly, if you are a Superman completest. No, really.\n\nSuperman IV has a lot to answer for, really. It--and the preceeding movie--meant very few movie makers in Hollywood took the superhero genre seriously for a long, long time and though Tim Burton's Batman would level the playing field a little more soon after, The Quest for Peace truly showed how not to treat Superman or his genre."

They could have also done the action sequences TV style because I doubt a Superman show will cost more then a million dollars to make.\n\nWhat ruined this movie wasn't a bad script or a low budget but bad financial decisions. The filmmakers didn't use the $17 million wisely. What makes a good movie isn't the special effects. It's the story and the characters behind it.

That is a valuable point to make, but a successful franchise where the majority of the fanbase are kids IS NOT the place to make it. Older comic book fans were disgusted, and maybe I would be if I were to rewatch the film today. The point is, at six years old you don't tend to question or notice this blatant propaganda. However, even at six I remember thinking that \"Nuclear Man\" had a fantastic presence. I obviously didn't pay much heed to his acting...\n\nIt is sad that the \"Superman\" franchise makes up the highest profile hits of Christopher Reeve's career. The first couple of movies were great, the last two less than, but I sense he was capable of achieving much more in his field; especially when 'integrity' looked to be one of the lowest creative priorities by the time it came to this outing. Stick any kid under the age of, say, 8, in front of this and they MIGHT be entertained. Unless they're a child prodigy; in which case they'll probably run up something better with the camcorder inside an hour. Don't blame me if your kid is of above average intelligence and hates you for subjecting them to this. Adults? Do I even need to tell you that you should probably steer clear... ?"

Superman Returns was abysmal, Man of Steel was incoherent and unstructured and from a recent viewing of Batman v Superman, I can honestly say it wasn't a particularly good film, inheriting the same problems that made Man of Steel dull.\n\nThe elaborate production phase and budget constraints are what made this movie to the gradual process of a colossal failure.\n\nThe first 3 films, with the third instalment being the film that took the franchise downhill, featured revolutionary visual effects that were outstanding for its time period.\n\nThis film however, the reduced budget is so evident with a notable deterioration in quality with the effects, as they look absolutely appalling. The same archive footage of Superman flying is recycled with every shot and flying sequences are in a straight line as opposed to the cinematography they were able to achieve in the first 3 films.\n\nChristopher Reeve continues to give a good performance as Superman, arguably being the only positive aspect of the film.\n\nWith 40 minutes deleted from the theatrical version, the movie feels choppy, poorly edited and nonsensical.\n\nThere were attempts to make a good film, but the premise did not pay off, and the film is devoid of any redeeming qualities.\n\nFinal verdict, even rating it based on its genre, in general it is one of the worst movies ever made."

But what seems to be missing is the part how Lex Luthor got the Superman DNA from a hair. You see, Superman donated a hair to a museum to show how strong it is. The hair was holding up a really heavy steel ball that weighed a couple of hundred pounds. All Lex had to do was snap the hair with a simple pair of bolt-cutters! Then when the ball hits the ground, it bounced a little bit! What a bunch of c**p. The part where Superman and Lois copy the scene from the Original movie where they fly hand in hand was really bad. In the original, that was a long scene. In this stinker, the scene was a minute or so? I can't go on anymore. Let's make this the #1 worst movie of all time."

The rest of the thankfully sparse effects were even worse, up to (or DOWN to) the ludicrous fight on the Moon.\n\nVery nearly as bad was the plot. When it wasn't utterly forgettable (85% of the movie), it was excruciating. It's hard to believe that co-writer Lawrence Konner was involved in the writing of Star Trek VI - The Undiscovered Country. There were reports that this movie suffered badly because it was cut severely for the theatrical release, but it's difficult if not impossible to imagine more scenes doing anything but making us squirm more in our seats.\n\nThen there was the acting. Mark Pillow as Nuclear Man: I think that says it all. Ugh. Jon Cryer was somewhere between Pillow's performance and fingernails on chalkboard. Only somewhat less competent was the child actor whose character gets Superman to start questioning the wisdom of nuclear weapons.

Superman, a huge achievement for all involved and the film that more or less kick started the superhero genre and Superman 2, a brilliant sequel that, while not a huge landmark like the first, can still stand on it's own in terms of story and acting.\n\nBut then it started falling apart.\n\nWhen the Newmans were bought in to write Superman 3, that's when I started dreading the future of your franchise. They wanted to make your first movie campy and all that nonsense, but luckily they got kicked out. Sadly with Richard Donner truly out of the action, the Salkinds bought them in and Superman 3 became the film I was dreading it to be, a silly and stupid film with constant mugging from Richard Pryor and really terrible and dated gags.\n\nThen they tried to give Supergirl a film of her own and it even that wasn't a hit with the critics.\n\nAfterwards the Salkinds said \"Enough is enough\" and thus they sold you off to Cannon Films.\n\nThat's when the cracks was really starting to show.\n\nCannon are a rather cheap company and I knew a studio as cheap as Cannon certainly can't do justice to a superhero like you.\n\nAnd they tried.... they really did...\n\nand it was all for nothing.\n\nI really hate to say this to ya Superman, but man oh man was your fourth film a huge disaster all round. In fact even more than the third one.\n\nThe plot sounded rather interesting, I mean you trying to stop a nuclear war from happening. That is a perfect concept for a fourth film... but then Nuclear Man walks in, and the only way from there is downhill.\n\nReeeaaalllyyy downhill.\n\nSoon the film starts to really take a nose dive, everything from the dialogue to the incredibly cheesy and horrifically awful special effects start taking over.\n\nWe're not taking this seriously, we're laughing.\n\nLaughing at the fact that the tornado scene is so laughably fake (fake as in it was all done on green screen.\n\nLaughing at the fact that the final battle between you and Nuclear Man is really just an excuse to show off incredibly cartoony looking effects.\n\nLaughing at the fact that Gene Hackman sounds unintentionally funny as Nuclear Man (played by a rather wooden looking Mark Pillow by the way).\n\nBut at the same time, we're thinking... why... why are we being subjected to torture like this? Look I'll give some of the actors credit, it was nice to see Gene Hackman back as Lex Luthor (even though the horrible dialogue didn't do much)and Christopher Reeve was alright as of course you, Superman.\n\nBut all of it still feels like it was done for nothing.\n\nIt feels like it was just done to keep your franchise alive and made for a quick penny so that Cannon can make more cheesy films.\n\nWell the joke was on them... The film ended up bombing and it was panned by critics and fans alike.\n\nYet I still feel disappointed at you Superman, I feel disappointed that instead of a film that would rub away all those horrid memories of Superman 3, we instead got a film that made that look like Citizen Kane.\n\nHonestly Superman, you're a super hero. And you should know better than to put your name on low budget guff like this? Well at least you got Man Of Steel afterwards though that still isn't saying much...\n\nHere's hoping someone actually does you justice in the near future...\n\nFrom\n\nRetroMagFan"

The acting is sub par by \"Superman\" Standards, the director didn't even try to make it look like New York or Close enough to Metropolis, the visuals on the movie takes the term\"Low Budget\" to a whole another level,the story sounded good on paper like I said earlier, and all that was once great fell to parp. This movie series had started out good but after two awful sequels an equally awful spin off movie I think it's safe to say, The Man of Steel got rusted big time by this movie."

Chris will alway's be remembered, especially after seeing not only him on two episodes of Smallville, but Annette O'Toole who play's Martha Kent on the show, played Lana Lang in Superman 3!!!!

FIRST OF ALL, IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE ORIGINAL PRESENTATION AND HAVE ONLY SEEN THE CLEANED-UP DVD, YOU AIN'T SEEN SQUAT!!! My comments will go towards the original theatrical/vhs release, the stuff before that attempt to clean it up on dvd. That crap don't fly with me (no pun intended). Where do I begin to complain?\n\nAfter watching this movie, I came to the conclusion that Superman's ability to propel himself at near limitless speeds (which look oddly slow in the bad bluescreen of this film) lies in his super-flatulence. I say that because of the smell I noticed while watching it. Where the hell did Superman get \"rebuild-the-great-wall-of-China-vision\"?!? When did he develop telekinetic ray beams (when he lowered the citizens held aloft by Nuclear...ugh....Man). When did Lois Lane become a crack whore? When did Perry White die, only to be reanimated? When did Jimmy Olsen turn 45? When did Christopher Reeve lose all the muscle from his previous 3 movies, only to show up at 135 lbs soaking wet for this one? When did human beings learn to talk in space? Why didn't Mariel Hemingway implode when Nuclear...ugh...Man dropped her in space?!? When did Gene Hackman's career go so wrong? Why didn't Mariel burn up in earth's atmosphere when she was carried in and out of it? How the hell could Superman push THE MOON (a plot device stolen from a cartoon episode of He-Man)?!? Why would a clone of Christopher Reeve look like a gay 1980s aerobics instructor? Why did they reference a first Nuclear...ugh...Man when those scenes were cut? Why did Superman's cape's S-shield peel apart? Why did the wires show at all times? Why did Superman go flying in front of bad bluescreen with a crack-addicted skeleton? Why were a large portion of the flying shots stock shots from Superman II or III? When did Superman become a fascist dictator, spitting on the sovereignty of not only the United States, but the United Nations (the mecca of all you commies out there)? When did Nuclear War have ANYTHING to do with Krypton's sun blowing up the planet? There are more questions, mostly relating to continuity of the movies, but I don't wanna go into them. This movie made me ashamed to be a SuperFreak--even at 12 years of age (when I first saw it). The wires have been cut out of the dvd, the color's been enhanced (the original blue screen shots looked 30 years old, even in 1987), and the blue screen's been digitally 'repaired.' If you want to see how this movie REALLY looked, get an old VHS tape of it. They're everywhere. But, you'll see all the crap I'm talking about. This movie will make you hate America's greatest pop icon."

Even Jackie Cooper's Perry White is simply a caricature of a caricature. Margot Kidder's Lois Lane apparently had all of her brain cells removed by Superman's kiss at the end of Superman II. The movie is garbled.\n\nThe plot is unclear. The characters lack motivation. And I picked all of this up at age 13. I remember riding home from the theater, having seen Superman IV while my parents saw something else. And boy, did I wish I'd gone with them once the movie was over, and I told them so.\n\nOne last note: a lot of users have bashed the character of Nuclear Man. They were right to do so; he's an awful character with an awful haircut (Crowded House called: they want their bassist's hair back!). But even though the character was terrible, Mark Pillow's portrayal of him was somehow even worse. If you look up Mark Pillow on the IMDb, you'll notice that he has had a total of two other roles. That's two too many. Your average used-car salesman could have done a better job. And probably would have had better hair, too!"

It kinda seemed like Christopher Reeve and Margaret Kidder were just having fun with this one.\n\nTruthfully I don't really like any of the old Superman's for various reasons, but I can at least respect them. In this one, they just made up super powers that Superman doesn't have, which I could even go with if they explained it.\n\nMy main beef with this one is, the bad guy, this Radiation Man, is supposed to be powered by the sun, and his powers are basically the sun's energy...and Superman get's his power from the yellow sun...therefore when this guy hits Superman with the energy then it should actually make Superman more powerful, but instead it gives him the flu???? If you're a Superman fan at all, you can watch this just to say you have seen it, but you probably won't like it.

It is based on a kids comic after all.\n\nIt has a political message, which isn't a bad thing and which comic books in themselves have repeatedly tried to get across. Why wouldn't Superman speak out about nuclear disarmament? He can't just keep fighting Lex's schemes all of the time?\n\nMaybe it's not delivered in the most believable way and the bad guy is a bit weak character-wise. I might have liked it more if Supe had managed to make friends with him to unite and save the world together as a better final message, but I was only 7 when this was released, so my opinion didn't count and probably still doesn't.\n\nI would also have liked to have seen more in the beginning to establish Clark and Superman's characters and situation. It's just assumed that the audience has seen at least one of the previous films or read the stories and knows what's going on.\n\nThe backwards and forwards between the characters at the dinner party, which obviously inspired a similar scene in 'Mrs Doubtfire' (1993) did not impress me at all.\n\nGene Hackman's (I've never been a fan) character is not comic book enough for me, but instead he is farcical and his side of the story is the full Ham, Cheese and Corn special, not helped by the nephew character.\n\nNuclear Man is also a terrible actor, but at least he's a comic bad. His ending was also very badly handled and explained. I actually did blink and miss it, finding myself at the epilogue without a clue how he had been defeated or if he really had been.\n\nHe did help me to realise what 'Family Guy' were taking the Mickey out of when they gave Meg long finger nails in the nuclear waste episode though (Series 3/Episode 21).\n\nI'm sure the nerds would claim that it's riddled with inaccuracies, but I've never been in to DC enough to care. Supe would be the character that I would follow though if I did.\n\nThere are however, a lot of plot holes and scientific errors that even I could see, which can't be good, because I got an 'F' in science.\n\n300.55/1000."

But it inspired so many comic book stuff, like Doomsday and Cat Grant were inspired from Nuclear Man and Lacy Warfield. Which those actors don't deserve the hate they get for this film. I thought Mariel Hemingway did a lovely job as Lacy, and despite his cheesy role, Mark Pillow did what he could. I think this movie deserves a second chance because it's message was about peace, which is what modern Superman movies like Man of Steel ignore greatly. This is still a Superman movie worth seeing and it doesn't deserve to be on the worst films of all time list."

Meanwhile, Lex Luthor has returned and he has created a new villain for Superman to fight...Nuclear Man. Superman IV has a weak plot, weak acting, and is a very anti-climatic ending to the Superman series.\n\nEverything that the first movie did right is done wrong. The action is very trite, and not exciting to watch at all. The romantic subplot...There is none. Lois Lane has shrunk to a nothing character, while a new pointless love interest played by veteran TV movie actress Merial Hemingway tries to steal Superman's heart. Even the return of Lex Luthor couldn't save this movie. He becomes a secondary, pointless character, with none of the wit he had before. The special effects are actually worse than the first film, which makes this movie laughable. The Nuclear Man is a stupid villain that serves no purpose but to cause Superman a minor annoyance. The biggest problem this movie had was that it was way too preachy. The cast might as well have held their hands to their hearts and sang \"God Bless America\".\n\nThe acting is ridiculously bad. Christopher Reeve seems fed up in the role that made him famous, because he doesn't seem to try anymore. Gene Hackman plays the role of Lex Luthor the same as always, so I'll blame the script for his inadequacies. Mark Pillow (Nuclear Man) is so unbearable that I almost left the rooms during fight scenes.\n\nOverall, avoid this movie at all costs. That's all I can say. AT ALL COSTS! 1/10"

Lets get the 'alright' out of the way, the acting. The acting in this film is at best decent, Gene Hackman returns and does a great job at Lex Luthor, and extra credit is given here considering the dreadful script. Christopher Reeves again does his job as superman but lacks the charm he gave in the first to films, again this could have been due to the poor script. The rest of the cast was pretty much average or under-average, very forgettable Now onto what made this film the worst film I have ever seen, when watching this film I couldn't help notice that the writers obviously were either drunk or just monkeys as there were some major oversights, for instance in one scene, the main villain flies into outer space with Lois Lane, with Lois somehow scream, even though there is a lack of oxygen in space. Other such oversights were a fight on the moon with throwing a rock hurts superman, somehow and the main villain being created from the sun with already dressed?? I could go on and mention more but well there are literally to many to mention The music was uninspiring, John Williams opted not to score this film and instead Alexander Courage was chosen. Don't get me wrong Courage was a great composer, but he seemed to to a half-***** job and I never got the feeling of something truly evil this film is an easy miss, I watched it just out of sheer interest of how bad a film can be, There is no need to watch it, take it from me you will never see a worse film and there is no need to see it."

They re-use a lot of the same shots to save money (apparently a third of the budget was spent on the first scene, saving astronauts) and this ends up being terrible and oh so very noticeable. Nuclear man is one of the worst acted and corny looking villains of all time, I felt like I was watching an episode of Red Dwarf.\n\n2/10: Only redeeming feature is getting to see Reeve and the other greats.

        "review_detailed_main": "FILM: 3.5/10.\n\nSuperman IV: The Quest for Peace, a sad conclusion to the Reeve era, fails to soar even with Christopher Reeve's admirable story concept and his usual solid performance. While Reeve's dedication to exploring the ethical implications of Superman's powers is commendable, the execution falls flat due to a woeful script that lacks depth and coherence.\n\nOne glimmer of hope is the welcomed return of Gene Hackman as the cunning Lex Luthor. His charismatic presence injects some much-needed energy into the film, but even his talents are overshadowed by the film's dire visual effects. Shots are shamelessly repurposed over and over again, creating a monotonous viewing experience that fails to captivate.\n\nIt's evident that major budget cuts have taken a toll on the production. The effects suffer greatly, resulting in laughable moments and a proliferation of plot holes. Superman's new powers, such as his inexplicable ability to construct the Great Wall of China with his vision, feel out of place and absurd. These odd additions only serve to further confuse an already convoluted storyline.\n\nMargot Kidder's Lois Lane is largely absent. Her lack of presence is sorely felt, leaving a void in the film's emotional core. Without her chemistry with Reeve, the romantic subplot loses its charm and becomes forgettable. It's a missed opportunity that detracts from the overall experience. With Annette O'Toole's Lana Lang M. I. A. Too, there isn't much to latch on to in the drama department.\n\nThe introduction of Nuclear Man as Superman's main adversary is underwhelming. He comes off as a poor-man's Bizarro, lacking depth and failing to create any sense of menace. The showdown between the two feels lackluster and uninspired, a far cry from the epic battles we've come to expect from the franchise.\n\nUltimately, Superman IV: The Quest for Peace is a disheartening end to the Reeve era. Its shortcomings, from the dismal script to the budget constraints that mar the visual effects, prevent it from reaching the heights of its predecessors. It's a film that fails to do justice to the legacy of Superman and leaves fans longing for the glory days of the Man of Steel.\n\nFORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray\n\nVIDEO: 8.5/10.\n\nNative 4K presentation, Detail level: Good, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Excellent, Encode: Excellent, Master condition: Excellent\n\nAUDIO: 7/10.\n\nDolby Atmos, Dialogue reproduction: Good, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Good, Dynamics: Good, Surround sound presentation: Good, LFE content: Good\n\nMOOFIEMETER: 4/10."

Superman's UN General Assembly arrival and the speech was one of the best things in the series. Reeve was awesome as always. Gene Hackman's campy take on Lex Luthor is one of my favorite. Now I understand why Supergirl (2015) hired Jon Cryer as Lex Luthor.\n\nThis film made $36.7 million on a budget of $17 million, a moderate return in my opinion. It was a shame that this movie didn't perform as expected even with the return of all the original cast members."

        "review_detailed_main": "In THE QUEST FOR PEACE, Superman finds exactly that. Following this box office bomb, the series would go on to rest in embarrassed peace until Bryan Singer would come along with a spiked baseball bat to beat this dead horse back to life in 2006. This movie is bad. Real bad. It's a miracle we still enjoy comic book movies after SUPERMAN IV did everything in its power to scare us away from them. It's hard to believe Tim Burton would come along a mere two years later and amaze movie crowds with BATMAN. Even Richard Lester, the man who pit Superman against Richard Pryor and a \"computer\", would have nothing to do with this movie and the task of directing was turned over to a man named Sidney J. Furie, whose only other directing effort I'm familiar with is that lame soccer movie LADYBUGS with Rodney Dangerfield. SUPERMAN IV is a terrifying blend of poor special effects, hokey messages, and Jon Cryer as the most aggravating 80's stereotype to ever poison the big screen. This all about the nuclear crisis (or as Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor would call it\u0085\"nucular\") facing the world during the Cold War with all the major world superpowers on the brink of nuclear annihilation. A young boy's heartfelt letter convinces Superman to break his vow of non- involvement in the fate of Earth by disposing of all the world's nuclear weapons. Once that's out of the way, we get an hour of Superman doing battle with Lex Luthor's latest scheme: Nuclear Man, a walking atomic weapon with a period-appropriate mullet.\n\nThere's just so much wrong with this movie. I don't even know where to start. It's just bafflingly stupid. It can't all be bad, though\u0085right? There's got to be some good stuff here. Let's start with that: Gene Hackman returns as Lex Luthor and Mariel Hemingway is decently attractive as Clark Kent's new shoehorned-in love interest, Lacy Warfield. Well, now that we've got that out of the way\u0085\n\nOne thing that really annoyed me here is the same problem I've had with previous Superman movies. We get one plot for the first portion of the movie (in this case, the first 35 minutes is all about Superman ridding the world of nuclear missiles) and then the movie just decides to shift gears for the rest of the show (battling Nuclear Man). The movie has no real flow whatsoever. The whole nuclear disarmament angle, while relevant to the period in which the movie was released, is just too cheesy to be taken seriously. A wide-eyed youngster is asked how he would solve the world's nuclear threat: \"Well, gee golly, I'd just ask Superman to do it.\" If that's not enough cheese for you, we have Jon Cryer (pre-TV fame) as Lex Luthor's nephew Lenny. Luthor has a history of surrounding himself with fools in the movies and Lenny is the most offensively bad of them all. With his bizarre 80's style and his surfer speech, you wish Superman would grab him by the collar, fly him out into space, and leave him on an asteroid somewhere. If that seems harsh, don't worry: you find out near the end of the movie that anyone, not just Superman, can survive the cold, airless, empty vacuum of space. Isn't that right, screenwriters Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal? I've accepted some pretty far-out concepts from the previous Superman movies, but that was only because they were fun movies (well, not so much with SUPERMAN III). This film doesn't get that liberty because it's nowhere near the level of its predecessors.\n\nThere's just so much stupid about this movie that it'd take more than this comment section to go over it all. Thankfully, it's been covered ad nauseum in countless online reviews that tear this movie to shreds. Despite being released almost ten years after the original film, SUPERMAN IV actually has worse special effects than when it started. They're just horrible. The flying effects are the worst of the series. There's also the matter of the rehashed elements from previous films: Lois and Superman go on yet another \"romantic\" flight over Metropolis (except the background images never quite match the flight movement of the two and it looks terrible) and we get another amnesia kiss to wipe Lois's memory of the event.\n\nThe audience isn't nearly as lucky. We're left with the memory of Nuclear Man: a creature mutated by Lex Luthor from a strand of Superman's hair, some fabric, one of those magical computers, and the sun. Nuclear Man generates an internal heat at the temperature of the sun without cooking those around him, goes inert when not in direct sunlight, and has radioactive fingernails. Still, I suppose it's better than Richard Pryor's supercomputer in SUPERMAN III. But not by much. The last 45 minutes or so of the movie are Superman and Nuclear Man battling back and forth a bit while Nuclear Man flies around the world creating messes for Superman to clean up with more arbitrarily created superpowers (i.e. his new Super-Rebuild-Walls-from-Scratch-o-Vision). It's all just embarrassing. And that's coming from me, a viewer. I can't imagine having my name forever seared into the end credits and having to admit I helped create it.\n\nSUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE is a comedy. It doesn't know it, but it is. It's laughably stupid with a plot the barely holds together and enough cheese to feed an entire third world nation. I enjoyed the first two Christopher Reeve movies, and I even found some high points in the much-maligned third film. But this movie has no real redeeming qualities and, worst of all, ended the Christopher Reeve/Superman saga on it's lowest note ever."

        "review_detailed_main": "Every single other comment for this movie has not given it anything more than a 3 out of 10. I can only assume that they watched the movie believing it would be any good.\n\nSuperman movies have always been campy (yes, even *before* that lovable hack Richard Lester threw his half-baked lot into Superman II), but people thought Superman III was the ultimate, the final, the only possible depth to which the Superman series could sink. It was unabashedly a comedy and it performed poorly, so the Salkinds left the series forever and handed the producing duties over to Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus, two wild and crazy guys from Israel who *just* wanted to illegally funnel funds from Superman IV and cut corners everywhere. They did so, and the film bombed at the box office.\n\nBut it shouldn't have. The problem wasn't at all with the script, the acting or the movie itself; the problem was with the people who saw it. They were expecting a serious Superman movie. What they got was the most unintentionally hilarious movies of all time, an understated classic of bad cinema.\n\nThere is only one way to watch this movie, and that is to watch it with friends and mock it endlessly. Despite the large-ish budget and well-known character, Superman IV would do very well as an episode of Mystery Science Theatre 3000 (a 90s TV show dedicated to mocking B-movies). It has everything: bad eighties hairstyles, completely illogical plot lines and more failed special effects than an episode of the old Doctor Who. Strings are easily visible, a police car magically appears out of thin air, Superman is referred to as \"The Dude of Steel\" and people seem to be oddly capable of breathing in space, not to mention the dialogue: \"You know what I can do with a single strand of Superman's hair?\" \"You can make a toupee that flies!\" If you're not as immature nor as odd as I am, the effect may be replicated by making a drinking game of the movie or inhaling illicit substances, but how it happens is not important. What is important is that this movie should not be condemned as a horrible serious movie, but be respected as a fantastic, if unintentional, comedy.\n\nSee you in twenty, indeed."

The problem with this lame duck sequel, is that Superman starts getting political. Now I can't speak for everyone but I prefer my superheroes heroic and willing to kick ass and save the world at a moment's notice, I don't want to see them go to congress to lobby against Nukes. What also kills Superman IV is the budget. The low budget kills what little credibility to be found, the villain Nuclear Man is awesome in his colossal stupidity. He certainly brings little menace to Supes and it's ridiculous that the climax involves Superman chucking plastic rocks at him. A low budget and a comic book hero is a deadly combo, the best that can ever happen is guilty pleasure fun. (1989's The Punisher and The Incredible Hulk TV movies) However in most cases they just hinder any enjoyment to be had. Also 1989's Punisher and Hulk movies, never tried to preach politics. All in all a sad way to see Christopher Reeve's last role as Superman.

Well, they put everything they had, and made it look gimmicky and even spawned stuff from the original. Well, their \"high-flying success\" eventually turns into a disappointment for most fans and moviegoers. Only Christopher Reeve's final performance as Superman can possibly save it, maybe even not. The weaker plot and low-budget special-effects totally turn it into a dull sequel. It even \"borrowed\" stuff from the original and even the first sequel, like the romantic flying scene with Lois Lane from the original (instead of flying through dazzling moonlight, they fly over smelly fields of cattle!)\n\nIf you expect something new in this sequel, don't. It absolutely has none. The plot is preachy, the performances are awful (Though Reeve still has enough strength to save himself) and the special effects are the most especially atrocious. Though it is debatable whether BATMAN & ROBIN, which was also the awful fourth entry of the BATMAN franchise, is any better.\n\nRating: * out of 5."

It wasn't, though. I know everyone has already pointed out the ridiculousness of the scene where Lacy Warfield (ugh - crap name) is taken into space, but what really got me is that when the Nuclear Man stopped being able to fly, she started to fall downwards. Not downwards as in towards Earth (which was behind here in the frame) but downwards as in towards the bottom of the screen. That's inexcusable really.\n\nWhen I watch the first film now, I love every minute of it, and the 'Can You Read My Mind' scene chokes me up every time. The poor reconstruction of that in this film could ruin it if you didn't look at the credits.\n\nIf you've never seen this film, watch the first one again instead. You'll be reinforcing a dream, rather than compounding a nightmare."

There's certainly something off about this film when that is one of the smaller problems with it.\n\nThe main problem with this film is it meanders around the plot. There are sub-plots that come in, take up screen-time and don't really have a proper pay-off. The way in which the villain Nuclear Man is established is weirdly convoluted and takes up so much time that he when he finally arrives about two thirds through the film, the conflict with him feels rushed, like they had a series of superhero cliches they needed to tick off a list in the shortest amount of time. In the midst of all this, there's meant to be some commentary on peace, but it's completely lost in the producers' quest for a generic hero versus villain superhero film.\n\nThis film is a mess. It might not be as bad as some comic book fans like to make out, but it is not a good film. Fortunately, nowadays there are good superhero films that have tackled the question of peace far more effectively. 3/10"

PLENTY. The script was bungled up from the start the idea that 1. Superman would listen to a grade school kid on his idea to remove all nuclear weapons and 2. The politicans would allow Superman to remove nuclear weapons, seems lame and unbelievable even from Marvel Comics. So next Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) creates a nuclear monster to fight Superman. I know for a fact that orginally there was supposed to be 2 nuclear monsters, one created from a nuclear bomb and the second created from the nuclear furance of the sun. But the producers decided to to use only the solar nuclear villian. So we have Superman fighting a villian dressed in red sequins and gold polyester. This is in addition to Superman's confusing relationship to Lois Lane (does she knows that Clark Kent wears the Big S?) Finally the sidekick for Lex Luthor (his nephew) looks and acts like a punk rock reject. So Overall the worse of modern Superman movies, but better than the movie Supergirl."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Superman IV: The Quest For Peace (1987)' is a total dud, but it isn't without its charms. There is some enjoyment to be found, however limited it may be, during the movie's campy combat, bumbling comedy and misplaced yet earnest efforts to promote peace (putting the burden back onto the people to want peace badly enough their governments have to ensure it is kind of iffy - not to mention almost hilariously na\u00efve). The sort of thing you laugh at more than with, but you won't really be laughing all that much because a lot of it is just a bit dull. Furthermore, it's the kind of experience that feels as though it's missing vital components, as if segments of it were simply never filmed. This is most evident during the fight sequences, which are criminally choppy and lack continuity to the extent they feel as though they're missing around 25% of the footage needed to make them coherent, let alone satisfying or fun. Everything just feels slightly off, like the picture was predestined to be bad. Of course, that isn't the case. I'm sure the filmmakers tried their best and did what they thought would lead to the ideal outcome, but so much of this seems misguided to the point that it's hard to believe the same level of care went into it as its predecessors. It's never boring, and Christopher Reeve is still the quintessential Superman. A couple of scenes are noticeably better than others, particularly a fun double date in which Superman and Clark Kent constantly switch places so as to create the impossible illusion they're both in the same place at the same time. There are some successful moments of comedy and I could see how some people might enjoy the more hokey elements in a sort of 'so bad, they're good' kind of way. Most of this just feels like a total whiff, though. It's watchable but not particularly enjoyable, nor particularly well-made. A lot of it fails pretty hard, to be honest. It's perhaps better than its reputation would suggest, but it's definitely the least successful Superman movie. While it's nice to see Christopher Reeve in the iconic suit again, not much else makes this one worth watching. It's disappointing."

This was to be their final outings in their respective roles in this iteration of Superman.\n\nUnfortunately, their presence alone was not enough to boost this movie both in story and at the box office. The Salkinds were no longer in charge. Instead, Golan-Globus and the Cannon Group were brought on to get this off the ground.\n\nThe premise of this movie was a worthy one for our beloved hero: Superman wants to rid the world of nukes and his traditional arch-nemesis Lex Luthor had other plans to prevent that. Unfortunately, the Cannon Group and their writers couldn't make it interesting enough to draw audiences.\n\nWhile I enjoyed many of the flicks put on by the (now defunct) Cannon Group, it was apparent that superheroes and the Superman franchise were not their forte'. \"Low budget\" doesn't always equal low quality, but for this movie, unfortunately, the results were less-than-stellar.\n\nFrom what I gather, the Cannon Group was already in financial trouble when they took on the reins of the Superman series. This was a chance for them to start the road to recovery and make up for Superman III's dismal performance. They failed. Cannon continued their downward spiral and Superman IV did much worse than III.\n\nThis was truly the end of the an era for Christopher Reeve's iteration of Superman, his fellow players who started in it and the original production company. While it was inevitable that the players for this iteration would no longer be playing those roles (as the years went by), it was sad to see their finale in these roles in this less- than-desirable chapter."

First let's start with the villains. Lex Luther's original actor was Oscar Award winner Hackman and in this movie he did play that part and extremely well and helped to lift up the movie very much. Then you have the main villain Nuclear Man! To me one of the most AWESOME and INCREDIBLE Super Villains of all time. There was no flaw here whatsoever! Could NOT of found a greater actor for the part and ever was about muscles at that time and indeed he had plenty and his powers was more than awesome. Nearly identical to that of Superman other that the cold breathe he displayed which was the only big flaw. Replacing original comedy relief from previous Superman movies to Luther's Nephew Lenny and I thought was a fabulous choice and much much funnier and better choice that the old fuddy duddy guy. Now like I said, what really makes up a movie and makes it desirable the most is the choice of actors and actresses in it and in this it was ALL the BIG original main names with no replacing actors or actresses. Then how can you not respect the fact that Christopher Reeves played as Superman cause everyone knew he would do an outstanding job regardless. Of course I hated many of the down right stupid mistakes but there was still plenty of incredible action, violence, chilling moments, comedy (in which I tend to love the most!) and even some romantic moments. So because of the fact that all the main big name actors was in there especially Christopher Reeves and Gene Hackman in it and in which they both did outstanding acting so in no way shape or form this could NOT of been a bust and the fact that Nuclear Man was to \"ME\" one of the most awesome Super Villains ever in history and so one more thing to be included is the fact that when Superman 4 came out I was just 7 years old and since then I have actually watched Superman 4 many times more than the other previous Superman movies so I must therefore give this a perfect rating respectively. I absolutely don't care about what others say, this is one of my favorite movies of all time."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's a little amazing, really, how quickly the original Superman franchise eroded into bad comedy. This being the ground floor of that descent, it bears little similarity to the original film beyond several key casting choices and a spit curl. Christopher Reeve returns as the title character, of course, with Margot Kidder suffering an expanded role and Gene Hackman back from a one-film exile to ham it up once again as a clueless, underwhelming Lex Luthor. Filling the Richard Pryor \"why?!\" role from the previous film is Jon Cryer, better known as Duckie in Pretty in Pink, who plays some sort of pointless, meandering male twist on the Valley Girl stereotype that was rolling through culture at the time. I'm still not entirely sure why he was elbowed into the plot. This isn't aggressively bad like Superman III, it's just hopelessly inept. In fact, the core of the story has a lot of potential: Superman, inspired by a letter from a young boy, destroys the world's nuclear armaments and discovers that some problems can't be solved quite so easily. It sputters and fails right on the launchpad, though, and soon falls back on a muscle-flexing brawl with some generic evil menace to solve the problem. Its grasp on physics, and reality as a whole, is so loose it's almost adorable. I'd pat my four-year-old son on the head and smile if he suggested we move the moon around to keep the sun out of his eyes, but for this film that's a legitimate solution. To say its answers make any sense would be an insult to sense itself. The whole thing plays like an easy answer to a complex problem, from the story to the editing to the acting to the effects work. These older superhero movies don't hold up to the rigors of time as a whole, but Superman IV looks particularly bad in a modern setting. Even the hero's indistinguishable costume seems cut-rate and fake, like they'd forgotten to commission a wardrobe department until the night before production. Head-shakingly pointless and dull, this film only seems to exist to kill time. Which, thankfully, it doesn't demand in great quantities. While the original cut came in at over two hours, some greedy last-minute cuts trimmed it down to a slim ninety minutes. Why the late edits? To ensure a few more showings each day at theaters nationwide. Of course."

The budget had been reduced to practically nil, which is the worst thing that could have been done. To present anything resembling a remotely convincing illusion that a man can fly, there has to be money spent on the special effects and loads of it. The film may have had honourable intentions, this I don't doubt. Sadly, a fairly interesting story was defeated by an exceptionally poor script. It was great to see Gene Hackman return as Lex Luthor (the character belongs to him) and at least he has some more scenes with Christopher Reeve. I don't particularly care for the villain Nuclear Man. He is laughable rather than menacing. The only scene I thought was any good, is the one where Superman returns to his home farm in Smallville. He is in his disguise as Clark Kent as he takes a walk around the house and the barn, alone. He thinks back to the days when he was raised on that farm by Jonathan and Martha Kent. How time has elapsed since then, now that his earth parents are deceased. With no one else around, Superman feels he can be more like his real self and not acting as the clumsy oaf. Then a stranger pulls up at the Kent farm and Superman reverts to his bumbling persona. Bring shot mainly in England, can only mean that the producers were a bit strapped for hard cash. It hardly mattered in the end. Box office takings were disappointing and panned by the critics."

I can see his point, it had been awhile since part 3, and that showed how tired the series had become. I will admit I do not know how it ever got off track, 1 was great and 2 was better! But I digress, anyhow, Reeve would not come back, until Warners gave him a barrel of cash (Superman was the only thing he did that would pay anyway) and he had to have total control over the storyline. Yeah, Chris Reeve in charge of the story! Talk about handing the keys to the asylum over to the patients! Under what circumstance would Reeve do the story? Only if it had an anti-nuke story line. He was a big no-nuke guy at the time. So there. Wondering why part 4 stank? Reeve and his silly story line, and also no Ilya Salkind to produce. He screwed up on part 3 a bit, but he would never have made a Superman film as bad as this. Stink-ola!"

Despite all it's flaws like Superman's Great Wall Rebuild-o-Vision, Captain Scratchy, no attempt to make Metropolis any different from New York City, a pointless scene of Clark Kent juggling dates as himself and Superman, a human woman breathing and falling in space, and using a mountain to plug an erupting Mt. Vesuvius which would actually cause pressure to build up an cause and even bigger and more devastating, this movie is still fun nonsense trashy so-bad-it's-good garbage, like watcing a movie you think you're gonna hate but actually find yourself liking it a little by the time the end credits roll. This so-called \"Worst Movie of All Time\" is certainly not as bad as Manos: The Hands of Fate, but it IS one of the better movies of that category, belonging in the same party as Plan 9 From Outer Space, the Gamera films, and Troll 2. But if you do find a copy of Superman IV in the wild, after you scoff at the idea of such a bad movie starring Superman, give it a watch. You may be pleasantly surprised."

The movie although offers a little story it's good because if you're an all action film fan than this film is for you since most of the story is about Superman fighting Nuclearman in several climatic battles across the world and even on the moon. It's a shame that not to many think so and besides this Superman film is an environmental film ifyou consider all of the nuclear talk here. We need to consider that this movie was produced in 1987. Cristopher Reever was an outstandingactor. There are only a few flaws on this film but trust me that you will love this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Although he is imprisoned, Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) further demonstrates that there is no correction facility that can hold him as he breaks out once again and plots revenge on the man that put him there. To that end, he fiendishly combines Superman's DNA and nuclear fusion to create a superhuman being he calls \"Nuclear Man\" (Mark Pillow). Meanwhile, the newspaper known as the Daily Planet has been bought by a wealthy tabloid publisher named \"David Warfield\" (Sam Wanamaker) who promptly changes the journalistic format of the newspaper to one that specializes in cheap sensationalism. He also replaces the editor \"Perry White\" (Jackie Cooper) with his daughter \"Lacy Warfield\" (Mariel Hemingway) to solidify the new format. Interestingly enough, while \"Lois Lane\" (Margot Kidder) continues to harbor a deep infatuation for \"Superman\" (Christopher Reeve) Lacy develops a romantic interest in \"Clark Kent\" (also played by Christopher Reeve) instead. And this creates a unique problem in itself when Lois and Lacy agree have a double-date with both Superman and Clark Kent. Now, rather than reveal any more let me just state that I am perfectly aware that this particular film has been roundly condemned by a vast majority of critics and even had the dubious distinction of garnering two Golden Raspberry nominations: \"Worst Supporting Actress\" (Mariel Hemingway) and \"Worst Visual Effects\". Additionally, Esquire magazine ranked it at #40 of the worst 50 movies ever made. That's pretty bad. Even so, while I agree that the special effects could have used significant improvement, I disagree with the assessment concerning Mariel Hemingway's performance. For starters, I didn't think her performance was that bad and I certainly don't think it merited a Raspberry Award nomination. If anything, I thought her presence actually helped liven up the picture to a certain degree. Likewise, I also disagree with the overall evaluation of the film by Esquire magazine. Case in point, it was nominated for an International Fantasy Film Award in the category for \"Best Film\" and ranked #4 at the box office upon its release. So there you have it. In any case--and not that it means anything--I personally thought this movie was better than its predecessor. So, for all of the reasons just mentioned, I have rated this film accordingly. Slightly above average."

        "review_detailed_main": "Superman IV: The Quest for Peace is a disaster, less than ten years after the wonderful Superman The Movie the series has been downgraded to a cheap Cannon film. Most people know now that Cannon slashed the budget for this film just before it was to be filmed and it is impossible to make a Superman movie on the cheap. These films are very reliant on their special effects, we must believe Superman is flying and using all his various Super powers and this film just didn't have the budget to convince the audience. The same awful effect of a greenish Superman flying towards the screen is used over and over again, every special effect looks cheap and nasty. If thats not bad enough the story is very poor and makes little sense. I felt sorry for the actors and the director as they were on a loser from the start. Christopher Reeve looks like he knows he is making a bad film and gives easily his worst performance as Superman and even more so as Clark Kent, also he must take some of the blame as he came up with the dodgy \"rid the world of nuclear missiles story\". Funny thing is even though the whole world knows Superman is going to pluck all the missiles out of the air and throw them into the sun they continue to launch them! Why not just say OK fair enough just take them all Superman, oh and by the way what exactly is going to stop the Red Army from marching across Europe now Supes? The UK for instance would have had no Nuclear Detterent??? But I don't really want to get bogged down in the whole Political side of this film, neither did Reeve's either as his story seems just an excuse for Lex Luthor to release the worst villain in any Superhero movie, Nuclear Man, or maybe Mulletman... whatever, he looks more like the lead singer of Whitesnake than a credible villain. Also on the acting side even Gene Hackman who is nearly always fantastic doesn't look in the mood to put the effort in. The less said about Jon Cryer and Marc Pillow the better, they are poor substitutes for Ned Beattie and Terence Stamp from the first two Superman films. What a shame Reeve's Superman ended up like this, best to remember him in the first two movies."

Or, scratched by his manicured talons.\n\nThe effects are rock bottom, bottom of the barrel, and they are reused multiple times throughout, which only reiterates their ineptitude. Colour shifts, and changes in tone only make the poor film stock (due to the film's slashed budget) even more obvious. The photography itself is flat, centred, and dull, it never rises above looking like a television commercial.\n\nA problem this series had was coming up with worthwhile villains.

It's not just that the story was weak but the execution needed a drastic overhaul. It's too bad that the film studio didn't put more money into the special effects. I'm not going to mention what I mean by that for legal reason from this site so you'll just have to watch the film and see what I'm talking about. If only Richard Donner could've put in some of his input."

        "review_detailed_main": "For years I've tried to stay away from Superman man movies because I caught the last half of it on TV on a Girl Scout trip. ( we were in a hotel in the Ozarks. I wasn't hauling a TV with a long extension cord in the woods. Though trust me at 13 I would have tried.) Being the typical comic nerd I felt compelled to watch it. All the time all sorts of people in girl scouts passed in and out of my hotel room and made a loud remark how much Superman 4 stunk. I've stayed away from the rest of the Superman movies for many years. Now many years later I'm marrying a man who's a even bigger comic book nerd than myself at 13. So I've seen just about every superhero movie ever made. Yes out all the four superman movies this one does stink. The first half of the movie is corny, but it does have the general sweetness of the first two movies. It's good to see Margo Kidder back as Lois. The film is VERY 80's, but in a warped way it's adds to the cartoonish appeal. I enjoyed Lex Luther's nephew. He's wouldn't be out of place in the Bill and Ted movies. As silly as this sounds I like The whole plot of having the cute little kid wanting Superman to get rid of nuclear arms.It is silly, but likable. Then Nuclear Man shows up and the movie goes down the toilet.\n\nWell, okay it's not totally the character's fault. Chris Reeve's performance through out the movie you can tell he doesn't want to be there. The special effects are cheesy. No,no, calling the special effects cheesy would be a compliment. But Nuclear Man does deserve to take the blame for the awful second half. He looks like a wrestler reject, can't act, has one of the worst costumes I've ever seen. Face it when a male bad guy has a better nail job than most of the women you know and that's suppost to be scary. Well something's wrong with the movie. Overall the worst Superman movie, but it is more watchable than Batman and Robin. I guess Warner Brothers has a pattern of making four movies off major DC characters."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\" (1987), this is the last \"Superman\" movie with the one and only, true Man of Steel; Christopher Reeve. He is one of the biggest elements that make this movie worth watching. This movie is not nearly as bad as people make it out to be. It's still much better than any live-action DC film made after \"The Dark Knight\" trilogy! This movie has a great story, great acting, great sets/locations, and a great soundtrack. The special effects are not too bad, but they don't go without their flaws in this movie of course. Probably the most glaring one is the same shot of Superman flying toward the camera over and over and over again. They use the same flying shot 11 times throughout this whole movie! Now, it honestly doesn't anger me like it does for most people lacking a sense of humor. I actually laugh at it and it's fun to watch! The only other glaring special effect issue are the wire shots, which don't really appear until the second half of the movie. Other than that, the special effects are actually decent and utilized to the max given the small budget! The story is interesting, Superman trying to rid the world of nuclear weapons and preventing our global destruction. There are a few subplots, but they all add up and tie the movie together in the end. The acting is great, again, especially from Christopher Reeve. He gives it his all and even with a small budget, you will still believe that a man can fly! Margot Kidder is stellar as Lois Lane as usual, Marc McClure is great as Jimmy Olsen, Jackie Cooper is perfect as Perry White, and Gene Hackman is once again the best Lex Luthor. There are a few new characters introduced into this franchise, and they all do an excellent job as well! Mark Pillow is great as Nuclear Man, Jon Cryer is hilarious as Lenny Luthor, Sam Wanamaker is excellent as David Warfield, and Mariel Hemingway is funny and charming as Lacy Warfield. All of the actors do a great job! They realize that a low budget can't replace the quality of acting. The sets/locations are nice, they look like part of a comic book, which is a neat change of pace in this series. It really gives the movie a nice atmosphere! The soundtrack is excellent. It takes the original brilliant film score of the one and only John Williams, and gives it a different level of depth. Alexander Courage did a fantastic job adapting John Williams' original \"Superman\" musical score! Overall, this movie is a lot of fun and is definitely worth watching. I give it 4 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 8 out of 10 stars. Remember, just because a movie has a low budget, does not mean it can't be entertaining. \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\" is entertaining in every sense of the word, and always will be. To end my review, let us have a moment of silence for the late, but always phenomenal, Christopher Reeve. He has really helped bring this character to life, Christopher Reeve is Superman and he will always be Superman. Rest in Peace, Christopher Reeve. You will always be the one, and the only, true Man of Steel."

        "review_detailed_main": "After going through the painful territory for \"Superman III,\" I have now gone myself to the stupidity territory of \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace.\" This is the end of the franchise, and for Christopher Reeve for playing both Clark Kent and Superman. The plot of the movie is pretty much lame, because it is really about Superman who is going to rigged the world of all nuclear weapons while Lex Luthor escapes from prison with the help of his nephew as they create their own Superman as he was born from the sun with all the nuclear solar powers to become Nuclear Man or something like that. Sorry for not giving you much detail about the plot, because the movie itself actually goes completely nowhere. Its amazing how this franchise went completely downhill, where you start off something amazing to a travesty. If this movie didn't killed the franchise, then the Salkinds didn't have to fire Richard Donner for \"Superman II\" so that he can finish the movie 100 percent, and have Tom Mankiewicz (on IMDb trivia for \"Superman III\") direct \"Superman III;\" if it stays like, then it would be either a great trilogy or make four or five \"Superman\" movies so that this franchise would stay strong, and very much ended on a satisfactory note. But no, Donner got fired so the Salkinds would bring Richard Lester to direct \"Superman II\" (which I still enjoy, but Donner's cut is better) and \"Superman III\" so they would go into camp factor, and have Richard Pryor in the third movie. Now, for the fourth movie, the Salkinds gave up and sold it to Golan-Globus' Cannon Films to produce the movie, which it definitely makes matters worse. The special effects in this movie are just awful. How awful? The budget was originally 36 million dollars, but as Cannon Films was into financial problems, they slashed the budget to 17 million dollars as they kept reusing effects like Superman flying right into the camera and have it poorly composite. I wish if they hadn't slashed its original budget, so that effects wouldn't look like this. The only good effect is the same footage from the first three movies that ends with Superman flying into space, and smiles at the camera. You really if the effects for this movie are just as good as the first three, and maybe keep getting better at it. The movie is directed by Sidney J. Furie, who is a director that I am not familiar with has not done a great job on making this movie, and I wonder if he wasn't satisfied the way how the movie is presented; if he admitted it, then I would forgive him. The story itself isn't that well told, but it comes to a shocked that Christopher Reeve co-wrote the screenplay. I remember watching videos of him on YouTube, where he said that he wasn't satisfied with the third one so he can make a \"Superman\" movie that he want to see so it can be as good as the first two, and pretty much forget about three. I'll give him credit for that for at least trying to come up with a better story, but sadly it was not well executed as Reeve himself isn't satisfied with this movie as he hoped for the way he envisioned. The action isn't really that good either, and I really don't have much comment on the music so its really just there. This movie is filled with a bunch of errors like the child actor that plays Jeremy disappears out of nowhere, Nuclear Man kidnaps Lacy as he takes her to space as she can breath perfectly fine, Superman moving the moon, fixing the great wall of China and Superman getting sick as we never see how is able to recover, when he has that darn green crystal in his hands. Wow, movie! I mean, wow! Now, after my issues with this movie, is there anything that I liked? I hate to admit, but the movie is filled with great actors who very much wasted on such great talents. Most of the actors and actresses gave their all, but pretty much ended up by going into a bad direction. I don't have much comments on either Mariel Hemingway or Mark Pillow as Lacy and Nuclear Man, because they're just there and don't care whether they did good or bad. However, it is nice to see Gene Hackman returning as Lex Luthor as he did his best with a bad script, but don't think he did good as the voice of Nuclear Man which I find it pretty silly. I really don't care for his nephew as he is played by Jon Cryer. Margot Kidder does her best to as Lois Lane, and I really wish if there was more romance between her character and Superman. Oh, I forgot to mention that she does remember that Superman's real name is Kal-El as that erased memory kissed didn't help from the second one, and now Superman erases her memories again. Well, gee, that was pretty pointless. As for Christopher Reeve, it is sad that this was the last time that we ever seen him to play both Clark Kent and Superman, until his passing on October 10, 2004; he still is giving a great performance and whenever he is on screen you know that he will always be Superman as his legacy will live on forever. We surely do miss him, and I know many fans will still remember him. Even me. With that said, \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\" hits the nail of the coffin for killing the franchise as he returns to the big screen in \"Superman Return,\" then he disappears, and reappears again in \"Man of Steel.\" I give this movie a 2 out of 10."

I'm just glad to be done with all the movies in this series. These were films that got worse with every installment until we finally tanked with the most painful of all. I was surprised at how this movie was only 90 minutes long. It felt more like hours because of how bad it was! Maybe it would have worked better if it actually was longer. Then again, I have seen deleted scenes that are incredibly stupid.\n\nAnyway, there are so many of these scenes that are entirely pointless. We get some parts in the beginning that show Clark Kent trying to sell his house. This adds up to nothing and is stupid. Then there's really big subplot where this new woman falls in love with Clark Kent. We later get scenes of him changing personas while getting an interview with Lois Lane. Again, all of this means nothing. It seems like every scene is just taken from the other movies. We see Lois find out his true identity and then he erases her memory. This is lifted directly from \"Superman II\" and has no meaning. We see Lex Luthor communicate directly to Superman in the same way as the first movie.\n\nThe plot is that Superman is trying to get rid of the world's nuclear weapons, but Lex Luthor creates a villain named Nuclear Man. We literally see him being born as in we actually briefly see this guy as a fetus that turns into a grown man. What? There's another scene where Luthor is with this woman in a dress from the French Revolution. What does any of this mean?! The special effects are downright terrible. They literally had nine years to improve and the blue screen effects are among the worst I've ever seen.\n\nThe pacing in the film is terrible. So many pointless scenes and then a bunch of dragged out action scenes. Nuclear Man kidnaps a woman and takes her into space even though she can't breathe in space. Were the people working on this even trying? This movie was so awful there wasn't another Superman film released in theaters until 19 years later with \"Superman Returns\". Watching the movie, you can see why the production on these films went through so much trouble. While I didn't like \"Batman Vs. Superman\", I'd still take it over this! *"

Granted, it's a disappointing finale to the original run with Cannon's financial troubles severely hampering certain VFX shots and cutting 45 minutes from the runtime certainly not helping matters but for the most part this is a much better film than Superman III. Sidney J. Furie's direction is much more interesting than Richard Lester's, while the breezy 91-minute runtime means you often scarcely notice when plot points are brought up and dropped off at random. The regular players of the series are a joy to watch with a returning Gene Hackman going full ham, Christopher Reeve as usual takes pride in his performance and with a larger degree of creative control means a story tailored specifically to him. Annoyingly, the only one I didn't fully vibe with was Jon Cryer as Lenny Luthor, he doesn't quite have the dynamic that Ned Beatty's Otis had but it's still a decent performance for what it is. Alexander Courage's music is a worthy adaptation of John Williams' timeless themes and it's a much more interesting score than Ken Thorne's efforts for this series. Yes, Golan-Globus were clearly cutting corners to try and keep Cannon afloat but outside of reusing the same shot of Superman flying 11 times, there's a lot of good practical effects work here that aren't worthy of an outright dismissal. Superman IV: The Quest for Peace isn't the worst superhero film ever, it's rather decent and I will fight that corner till the end of time. There's much more effort on display than you'd think with the key players working well to create what is ultimately an extended tribute to the golden age of Superman comics. It being a Cannon film means I can't hate it as there's an endearing terribleness sprinkled throughout, I'm just thanking god it's not Supergirl."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Superman I - IV' is a classic example of how movies lose quality with each sequel (I voted 9-7-6-4 for them). After the first movie established a monumental myth, including the tragedy of Superman losing his fathers (both of them), the second and third movie were passable continuations with a lot of action. Jolly good fun, but not outstanding in any way. By the time of the fourth movie, there are still the same actors, but along the way all the depth was lost. Superman tries to hide that with a pretentious 'destroy all nukes' mission imposed on him by a little boy. Hackman, who was a brilliant villain still in part 2, audaciously trying to use the 3 powerful criminals from outer space for his own purposes, is now just clowning around with Nuclear Man, basically keeping up the 'I want to kill Superman' routine due to lack of other hobbies. Nuclear Man is one of the most ridiculous baddies one could possibly imagine, acting like the four year old son of Hercules in kindergarten. I enjoyed watching part I-III again after many years, but part IV really is a disaster, no wonder they stopped making further (cinema) sequels for the rest of the century."

Christopher Reeves is great as always, though again awkward as times. Especially as Clark Kent. I know Kent is supposed to be a clumsy mild mannered dork. But this film takes it too far. Being a slapstick comedy. I really don't know if the filmmakers were serious about this, but if they were, that's just sad. \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\" is not as bad as (almost) everyone says. It's not a series film. But I like the idea of bringing peace to earth. But this is not the film to showcase that. Watch this with your friends and have a good time."

The end of Superman. Once Superman decides to destroy all the nuclear weapons in the world, Luthor sees any opportunity.\n\nI'll get what I don't like out of the way first. The plot, whilst a good idea in principal is a mess, the special effects are cheap and are often reused over and over again. Mark Pillow makes a poor villain. It's no surprise to see his career went nowhere. Clearly Milton Keynes is no substitute for New York (which usually doubles as Metropolis) Everything about it looks very cheap (costumes, set design, special effects)and apparently Lois Lane can now fly unaided and humans can breath in space.\n\nNow that's out the way, the movie has something's going for it, Christopher Reeve gives us one last performance as Superman, and is as brilliant as always. Gene Hackman returns as Lex Luthor, Margot Kidder is given more to do than in the last movie, Jon Cryer is fun as Lenny and the attractive Mariel Hemingway is a welcome addition to the cast too. I really liked her as a love interest for Clark, Jim Broadbent pops up here too, but he is not given as much to do as one would hope. The brilliant John Williams is back composing too!! Given the movies problems I'm going to count the running time as a good thing too.\n\nA sad end to the Christopher Reeve as Superman Franchise. From the minute Richard Donner was fired from \"Superman 2\" it had been all down hill."

        "review_detailed_main": "When franchise movies get long on the tooth, it become disheartening to see how far it can go with such bad qualities. Among all the films related to the man of steel up until this film, this entry was considered by far the worst in the filmography. The fact that some actually considered Supergirl (1984) to be better than this film spoke to many that something was not right with the direction of the films. However, when revisiting the film, it turns out what people may not like may not make this sequel as terrible as some other films go. Sure, it still doesn't match up to the original or the second film, but it is definitely not unwatchable. Surprisingly, as much as the cast was not getting along, it's very hard to tell that people were not enjoying themselves in the making of this feature.\n\nThe plot revolving around this feature takes place when the arms race continues to escalate between super powered countries. Feeling a need to do something after a young boy sends him a letter, Superman AKA Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve) looks to find a solution. Seeing the opportunity in Superman's involvement, the ever scheming Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) breaks out of prison with the help of his nephew Lenny (Jon Cryer). Luthor's plan is to create a being just as strong as Superman. Meanwhile the daily planet is being taken over by David Warfield (Sam Wanamaker) and his daughter Lacy (Mariel Hemingway), who ends up developing feelings for Clark.\n\nThe script was written by Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal who both wrote for The Legend of Billie Jean (1985) and The Jewel of the Nile (1985) prior to this. Seeing that part of the film's production problems came from the budget, it could be said that they both had to work with whatever they could. However, there are parts to the story that don't make any sense in continuity. Such as people breathing in space aside from Superman or Luthor having the know-how of creating another superhuman. There's also meaningless supporting characters such as Lenny and Lacy. Both of them do not contribute anything to the overall story and neither of them have a purpose other than hijinks.\n\nIf anything, the worst offender is the big baddie, Nuclear Man played by Mark Pillow. Not only does Pillow give a rather goofy over the top performance, but his weapon of choice is very lame. Fingernails,....that's right fingernails. This not only makes the action between him and Superman laughable but almost embarrassing. Forget all the mediocre special effects the production used,...they could have at least thrown their fists at one another. That's one thing Superman III (1983) got right. Thankfully, most of the other fun characters return like Perry White (Jackie Cooper), Jimmy Olsen (Marc McClure), Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) and even William Hootkins as an arms dealer.\n\nWhile the effects are not always on par with prior films, at least they feel closer to the first two superman films than that of the third film. Director Sidney J. Furie did his best to keep it that way along with his cinematographer Ernest Day. Furie was the director of Iron Eagle (1986), while Day had worked on Running Scared (1972). All shots are kept steady and have a good number of shots that capture the large scope of the setting. The best component to this feature though was the score composed by Alexander Courage. While not having the same grab as John Williams, Courage uses Williams' theme for Superman to a great extent making it sound almost like Williams was there. Not only is the score fully fleshed out but matches in tone as well to the rest of the films.\n\nSaying this is the worst film in the series is a bit hard to say. Superman III (1983) got several things wrong as well. At least here it felt more like the first two. Yes the effects are not as polished and continuity issues are vast, however the music, camerawork and returning actors put in one more performance that still retains the Superman feel."

It doesn't seem as action packed as the previous three Superman movies. It seems more like a political drama than a typical superhero film. It is more of a Cold War film starring Superman. In a way, it doesn't seem like a Superman movie as its focus on the Cold War themes. I could see what they're trying to do with Superman being a symbol for peace but still. I feel like the previous three are more recognizable and impactful as they seem to have done better."

Even Richard Lester would have made this movie a whole lot better. If they had spent some money on some decent effects that were available in 1987, then this movie would have been worth making. The effects are decades behind the level of the first, yet this one came out almost a decade later! Reeve does his best, but every other aspect of the movie is a complete failure (the original version was 134 minutes, proving so bad at test screenings they cut it to less than 90 minutes - big improvement!). It would have been a lot better to remember Reeve's Superman movies as a classic trilogy, instead of a four-part series that ended in doom."

There is, however, some good stuff within this 1987 sequel that makes it better than other bad sequels. The Alexander Courage score is wonderful, dramatic and sweeping and really lifts the movie during the action sequences. Mariel Hemingway's character, the lovely Lacy Warfield is a fresh character that adds much to the production. She's very pretty too. Gene Hackman makes a welcome return as the camp Lex Luthor and he has some funny moments with his nephew, Lenny Luthor. The story has some good themes and messages but they seem to get lost within the incoherent nature of the structure. It's nowhere near as entertaining as the first, second or even third Superman flicks but it's still a charming little flick that could have been so much more. 6/10 from me."
