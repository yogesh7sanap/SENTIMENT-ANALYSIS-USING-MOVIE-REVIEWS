        "review_detailed_main": "Madras Cafe is a political thriller which although claimed fictional, is inspired by real events. Its tells the conspiracy behind the assassination of ex-prime minister of India and the War situation in Baffna region of Sri Lanka...The movie is fast paced and is so intriguing and well-crafted that it can be easily this years best...\n\nWith zero publicity stunts, Madras Cafe director Shoojit Sircar tries to go out of conventions and comes up with this masterpiece...Political thrillers are ones which people in bollywood rarely attempt, and Shoojit does it bravely...Right from the start, the plot involves you in such a way that it is hard to come out of it.The pace of the movie, entangled characters,series of events, unveiling of conspiracies and then finally the climax- all are up to mark and hence make this movie a spectacle to watch...\n\nThe Screenplay is fabulous- it divides the movie in two parts efficiently. First, the war conditions in Baffna and then the assassination plot.In between shocking plots are revealed and it covers a vast script in its runtime.The reason why i compare this with Hollywood masterpieces like blood diamond and green zone is not because of the similarity, but due to the fact that Madras Cafe maintains the originality of facts while imbibing the fast paced and thrilling plot.\n\nJohn Abraham plays the lead role and this could be his best performance after dhoom, and does total justice to his role.Nargis Fakhri is the surprise package and shows that she can be versatile...The supporting cast is totally naive but they give their very best...\n\nThe only drawback or error you can say is relatively average editing.Its clich\u00e9 and too short for many scenes...\n\nBut as a whole, Madras Cafe is a sinister, evil political thriller which is supported by intense acting and direction and the plot is simply ravishing.Its a sign that bollywood has started making sensible movies on a large scale.\n\nMadras Cafe is not for crowd who like Chennai Express,Rowdy Rathore or Dabang, but it for those who acknowledge movies like A Wednesday, Shanghai and Rang De Basanti. This one wouldn't be watched on a large scale, won't gross in hundreds of crores,will not receive flurry of awards...but for me its simply one the best that bollywood has ever produced..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Probably the best movie of it's genre(spy/espionage/war/politics) from the Indian sub continent ever. Well researched, scripted and dramatized with a gripping pace and thrilling twists. Indian commercial movies normally have very faint reflection of reality or they go overboard in their desire to please all with more than a pinch of spice, item songs, super hero justifications and other indispensable Indian commercial considerations. But this one beats it all and yet retains the charm of a commercial flick. A perfect balance and a fine confluence of commerce and art,rarely seen in Indian cinema. A very strong script with probably the first ever peep into the working of Indian Intelligence Agencies and a panoramic capture of serious geopolitical subject with utmost honesty. A movie which remains true to the core yet maintains a edge of the seat drama through out. Not to be missed for the lovers of good Indian cinema, meaningful & superbly entertaining."

Critics state that it fails to capture the emotional aspect of the war but it was never meant to be viewed from the Lankan point of view.\n\nIt is a non Bollywoodish movie where we find no songs, dancing etc. There is no stupid romantic crap in the movie which other Indian political movies show. Relationship of John and Nargis is strictly professional(the way it should be).\n\nOne of the best Indian movies of the year after probably D Day and Ranjhaana. WATCH IT PEOPLE!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "It took 3 films and 7 years for Shoorjit Sircar (director) to deliver us with undoubtedly the best political thriller we can savor ourselves over a long time. 'Madras Cafe' is unarguably a gem of a movie that belongs to a rare genre of Bollywood cinema and deserves much more attention and applause than what it's being receiving.\n\nThe film is based on the backdrop of the Sri Lankan civil war in the late 1980's and early 1990's. It crosses its path with the plotting and execution of the then, Indian Prime Minster, whom we understandably can make out as Late Mr. Rajiv Gandhi. This film is so well crafted; it was not possible to find out a loophole in the entire plot.\n\nJohn Abraham (Producer), who plays as a RAW Officer has done a 100% justice to his character Vikram Singh. There are noticeable fluent and honest performances from Siddharth Basu and Nargis Fakhri (Rockstar) on the other hand as well. If you want to know more about what's inside, you have to go and watch it yourself. Although just do a bit of homework on the Lankan civil war events that occurred in the late 80's. You would not regret it.\n\nThere was one drawback of the movie though. The movie had an end. But as they say 'All good things comes to an end'. So, I guess it to be that way.\n\nMadras Caf\u00e9 is a slap on the faces of all the directors and also on the ignorant and bogged down movie goers who are ardent worshipers of senseless commercial cinema that has plagued Hindi movie industry over the last year and half. John Abraham here has to be appreciated immensely for the effort he has put in out of the movie, since; there was no one who was ready to produce this movie earlier until he accepted this project to invest in.\n\nThank you John Abraham and Shoorjit Sircar.\n\nWithout any second thoughts, being thankful and much obliged with this Intelligent and brave cinema,.. I'm going with an esteem \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729 (9.1/10) for Shoorjit Sircar's Madras Caf\u00e9. This one is a Must Watch.\n\nWatch and BE ENLIGHTENED..\n\nCheers"

Director Shoojit Sircar should be appreciated for a brave attempt on showcasing the political conspiracy involved in the assassination. The direction was great, specially the scene involving the assassination. That was the best scene of the movie.\n\nScreenplay of the movie is very tight, It was fast paced, though there are no entertainment elements, The movie will not bore you. My a** got glued to the seat and eyes on the screen. John Abraham did a great job by selecting such kind of a movie. He did extremely well.\n\nWill definitely have a re re re re watch for this movie... LOVED IT !!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Madras Cafe is a kind of political and espionage thriller that Bollywood never tried before. First half requires your patience. It is a mix of striking visuals, haunting sound design, introduction of key characters, their motives and the felling that something is not right. Second half is a piece of cinematic perfection where characters gets meaty dialogs, feel of danger keeps growing and finally in the climax you feel helpless like our hero. Based on actual events mixed with fictitious characters, Madras Cafe becomes a very important movie that should be watched by every Indian. Acting is top-notch. You won't be able to forget the imagery of first half and tension of second half long after the end credit starts. Director Shoojit Sarkar provides the ample conviction and uniqueness to whole idea and surprises you with his versatility (he directed Vicky Donor before). The movie has little flaws like packing too much information in first half and few key details not described clearly. But I can say with full comfort that it would be a mistake if you give this movie a miss."

        "review_detailed_main": "Set in the late 1980s and early '90s, during the time of Indian intervention in the Sri Lankan civil war, 'Madras Cafe' is A Solid Political Espionage Thriller by Director Shoojit Sircar. Its brilliantly directed, sharply written & commendably acted. Surely, among the finest films from 2013!\n\n'Madras Cafe' Synopsis: An Indian Intelligence agent journeys into a war torn coastal island, to break a resolute rebel group. He deftly maneuvers his resources to make significant breakthroughs, amidst a scenario where the enemy has no face and the only counsel is 'Don't get caught.' The story unfolds as his quest for the truth reveals a deeper conspiracy, by a faceless enemy, united to seize a common nemesis.\n\n'Madras Cafe' begins & ends, superbly. The twists & turns in the narrative are simply terrific, while the drama moves on a super fast-pace. In fact, 'Madras Cafe' gets better with each passing scene. The raw & brutal approach, along-with a nail-biting culmination, take this critically acclaimed film to dizzy heights.\n\nSomnath Dey, Shubendu Bhattacharya & Juhi Chaturvedi's Screenplay narrates a brutal human tragedy, sharply. Shoojit Sircar's Direction is brilliant. He deserves distinction marks for executing this rather difficult film, with such precision. Cinematography is excellent. Editing is pretty crisp. Action-Sequences are effectively done. Music & Background Score by Shantanu Moitra, are top-notch.\n\nPerformance-Wise: John Abraham delivers a convincing performance. Nargis Fakhri is first-rate. Rashi Khanna steals the show. She enacts a complex part, with wonderful control. Siddhartha Basu leaves a mark. Others lend good support.\n\nOn the whole, 'Madras Cafe' is a must watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "Often come films that are terrible yet has its cast performing extra- ordinarily. The rare ones are where the film is superbly directed with a fine story, but let down by the cast. Madras Caf\u00e9 is an example of the latter ones.\n\nThis espionage thriller is set in Sri Lanka during the 80s and 90s, while the country was torn in Civil War. The ethnic clash claimed number of innocent lives. The-Assassination-of-Rajiv-Gandhi-inspired incident served as the central point, around which the story is spun. When the conflict reached its zenith though rebel group of Tamil ethnicity, LTF (based on LTTE), India decided to intervene and send a peace force. This is where, our protagonist, Vikram Singh was sent to the war zone to ensure the operation of Peace Force does not fall through.\n\nBased on this promising premise, the story moves in considerably apt pace, weaving more threads, that culminated the cloth of the grand conspiracy. The screenplay deviated from the traditional three-act structure of storytelling; and it suited the narrative. The credit goes to director Shoojit Sircar for his relentless grasp on the film. There was barely a moment when the intensity of the film falters or the tone gets shifted. The documentary-style depiction of war casualties helped the cause of the film.\n\nThe two lieutenants for 'captain' Sircar would be Kamaljeet Negi and Shantanu Moitra. Negi's cinematography is remarkable, making some of the frames look like work of art. Moitra's background score set up the tone of the proceedings that were happening on the screen. For a Bollywood film, there is a scarcity of songs (read unnecessary songs), but when there is a song, it just drives home the point of the film.\n\nOn the negative side, as mentioned earlier, the cast was a letdown. That is why, it seemed, director had to compromise with the character development. Granted, an espionage political thriller does not require much of a character study. But, when your protagonist undergoes plenty of different scenarios, it should yield at least one or two not-so- similar emotions. Perhaps, John Abraham's acting prowess forced Sircar to make his lead character a one-dimensional one. Also, the out-of-sync conversations between Nargis Fakhri (a British Journalist) and Abraham often were cringe-worthy. Having Fakhri delivering all lines in English hardly improved what she could have delivered in Hindi. The support cast, barring a decent Siddharth Basu, did not support either.\n\nIt is a well-directed, well-shot film with a very good story. Just the same cannot be said about the acting of the cast. Notwithstanding that, this is an indication that Bollywood is slowly moving towards maturity and quality after a long time. Good political thrillers are hard to come by in our industry, and this one definitely worth a watch."

Well, it is. Sort of.\n\nIt's hard to describe what I feel is wrong with the movie. The plot is believable, and you want to see more. Not being intimately familiar with the horrible history of the Tamils, and having read only scattered articles here and there, I did not have any way to determine whether the movie was true to facts or not, and for this I apologize.\n\nSo, what's wrong? Well, it feels like there is an entire plot here. There is. But it feels like someone sat down, wrote a list of \"what makes western political thrillers good\", came up with 10-12 key scenes, and made those. Without really bothering too much with tying them together. It feels not so much rushed as uncohesive. And that's a shame, because ..\n\nThe visuals are nothing short of stunning. Excellent camera-work, glorious colors, scenery, and almost worth watching for this alone.\n\nBut ultimately, for me, the story is where the substance is. And in this one - perhaps this is due to me being unfamiliar with Indian cinema - it just feels cut to pieces and abrupt. Key events just \"happen\" from one scene to the next, and if you want to keep up with who's who, and who's pulling what strings, don't blink for a second.\n\nGiven that I don't know the material intimately, like I would with say a WWII movie, or a typical cold-war spy movie, and the actors were all unfamiliar to me, this movie was hard to follow. Perhaps for a more local audience, it would be infinitely more enjoyable. I do hope so, because it is a gorgeous movie, and I desperately wanted to like it."

A taut script, fantastic BG score and wonderful direction makes Madras Cafe nearly the best movie of the year. And after somewhile I really enjoyed a John Abraham performance. More than anything, hats off to John for producing this movie. All Kashyaps, Motwanes watch out, cause Shoojit Sircar really knows how to make serious topics in mainstream.

The film could have a better impact if it used names of the real people they trying to portray instead of resorting to semantics to camouflage their identities, while at the same time making it so obvious as to who the characters represent.

It gives an inside, one man perspective view of the crisis that India faced over late eighties and early nineties. A National crisis to which the Nation was ignorant (other than South elm) until their Prince was assassinated.\n\nIndo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord in late eighties turned into our own Vietnam (mentioned in the movie too !!) when the Peace keepers suffered the brutal violence. Inexperienced in Jungle Guerilla warfare , low on intel, Indian Regular Army took way more heat than the pre-estimate.\n\nThis movie takes you right there, when strategies were been compromised, missions failed and search for mole began. And continuing on a thriller ride, it throws you to the conspiring plot of Rajiv Gandhi assassination.\n\nPros: Authentic, very much detailing in the story line. Fast paced thriller.\n\nRAW never looked so smart, their equipments never looked so real and so do their men. John Abraham didn't become John Rambo neither James Bond.\n\nLead actress (portraying an NRI journalist) didn't utter a Hindi word in a commercial Bollywood movie. Big Kudos to the Director !!\n\nCombat scenes were gore, short & realistic and not exaggerated. Bullet effects,gun recoil, soldier's positions these usually overlooked areas were been paid full attention.\n\nGood budget brings helicopter long shot, brilliant location and areal photography.\n\nCons: Only major flaw I felt - Too much shaky camera movement. Dolly tracks are hardly been used. I actually got a headache after leaving the theater.\n\n\"Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high\" ... Soojit Sircar fearlessly just not presented one of the worst Indian political blunder but also held his head high above the commercial, controversial pressure. He has shown the guts to stay away from masala pricks (not even a single back ground song comes to hinder the pace till very last, no parallel love story building up within the lead pair)\n\nIndo-Pak war / tension even RAW covert missions have been featured in Bollywood for many and in recent times. Its a safe segment to have your audience with a patriotic breeze. But Soojit did not hesitate to read out those chapters which are not very much welcomed in Indian History. This movie may not do good in the box office which is ruled by all the Circus stuffs. But it has set another benchmark in Bollywood, and that will be real hard to reach."

Great work. riously, it's time now to get off the \"Chennai Express\" and get into \"Madras Cafe\" for a cup of the compelling,well scripted film.and overcoming the so called 100 core tamasha.

Sircar's direction is at best - average. He is incapable of extracting good performances from his actors. His storytelling and treatment lack lucidity. The cinematography in the first half of the film is very jerky and 'random'; with excessive use of track trolley in scenes shot inside the bureau.\n\nThe film's pace has been kept so fast that it's hard to keep up with the overflow of information. The on screen subtitles and supers seem to be put in as a mere formality. The film also has several anachronisms - most of them being John Abraham's costumes; others in sets and props.\n\nAlthough the film is a surrogate retelling of Rajiv Gandhi's assassination plot, not once does it mention his name. In fact, that particular character doesn't even have a name in the film. This is a major let down.\n\nThankfully, the second half has been shot much better and the film ends very organically - again a victory only for the writers. This film is definitely a one-time watch, although for me, it is definitely not a landmark film in Indian cinema."

The movie is very fast and sometimes you lose the plot. Feels like they had a lot of content and wanted to fit everything in a two hour movie which was actually a good Idea. Length of the movie was just perfect.\n\nThe second half is extremely gripping and connects all lose ends. In the end everything connects very well and everything makes sense.\n\nActing wise John was OK. Nothing exceptional about him. None of the characters actually standout. There are some emotional scenes but none of them actually make you cry. Its hard to imagine John Abraham make you emotional purely on the basis of this acting.\n\nTo me the true winner over here was the story line which is extremely gripping and makes up for everything. In the end its a good watch and leaves you wondering about a lot of things. Personally I loved it.\n\nNote: does not contain any Bollywood masala."

        "review_detailed_main": "Shoojit Sircar's 'Madras Cafe' is a tight and gripping account on the Sri Lankan Civil war and Rajiv Gandhi assassination. I'm amazed it took over 20 years for someone to approach such an important part of the subcontinent's post-independence history. But I can understand the reluctance due to the highly-sensitive nature of the different groups in our country, and Sircar's blend of fiction & non-fiction may have been the right way to tackle it.\n\nIt's different from the typical run-of-the-mill Bollywood action movies; it has an intelligent story, backed up by facts and actual incidents, with no romance, songs or melodrama. The characters are real and intriguing, each unique in its own way. The acting is commendable.\n\nPeople looking for a simple bombastic action thriller won't enjoy this. Only people aware of the subcontinent's political history and turmoil can thoroughly enjoy this movie, and what a treat it is, right up to inevitable but well-shot climatic assassination scene which leaves you paralyzed.\n\nAfter their thought-provoking and entertaining comedy 'Vicky Donor', with this movie it seems like Sircar and John (who produced Donor too) are here to change the ways stories are told in Bollywood - it's quite a welcome change!"

        "review_detailed_main": "How was Madras Cafe? Well it was riveting, fast paced, exciting, turbulent, keeps the viewer at the edge of his seat till the very end. The final moments of the assassination are well executed too. Excellent Cinematography lend an air of thrill and uniqueness to the film. The characters are very convincing. The movie paces well and ensures there is never a boring moment. Great to see a movie with no silly item songs or cheap Ranbir Kapoor nakedness on screen. Just the raw power of John Abraham at the helm of it all.\n\nMy realization in the last 5 minutes: The film is undoubtedly excellent and well executed. A first of it's type for Indian cinema. But the final 5 minutes clearly indicate that this film is very possibly part of Congress (read as \"UPA\") propaganda keeping in mind the upcoming elections. The aim is very clearly to push public sentiments towards the fact that Rajiv Gandhi loved the people of India and gave his life for the country and it's only the Congress in power that can take the country in the right direction, foreseen by Rajiv Gandhi during his life time. It's not loud, the message is given very subtly towards the end, through the scenes and dialogues. Very cleverly done as the elections are coming soon .. a tactic similar to what the Obama regimen did by getting something like \"Zero Dark Thirty\" subtly released to garner support before the elections. Definitely a political agenda behind the movie, nevertheless excellently done if you look at it from the artistic angle (and steer clear of its historical accuracy)!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The events leading up to the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, India's ex-PM whilst he was campaigning for re-election in Sriperumbudur District, near Chennai in south India on 21 May 1991 by 'Dhanu', a female suicide 'Tamil Tiger', is the subject of this latest attempt at gritty political Bollywood cinema.\n\nTold largely in flashback, we follow Indian army officer Major Vikram Singh (John Abraham) who is appointed by the Research and Analysis Wing ('RAW'), the Indian equivalent of the CIA, to conduct covert operations in the then on-going civil war in Sri Lanka in the late 1980s.\n\nPatriotic Vikram ('My country's security is my responsibility!') leaves his teary but dutiful 'army' wife Ruby (Rashi Khanna, in her debut) and travels by boat from south India to the war-torn 'island of jewels'.\n\nEn-route, he encounters a no-nonsense (she smokes!) British journalist, Jaya (Nargis Fakhri, last seen in 'Rockstar'), who speaks with an inexplicable American twang.\n\nBoth are on the search for Anna (Ajay Bhaskaran) the leader of LFT which is clearly modelled on the real Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ('Tamil Tigers') who are fighting for a separate Tamil 'Eelam' ('homeland') for the Tamil minority away from the rest of the largely Sinhalese majority.\n\nVikram wants to eliminate Anna; Jaya simply wants a scoop! A plot to assassinate the ex-Indian PM is discovered ('decoded') but will Vikram be able to save the day and more importantly, did 'RAW' and the then Indian government do enough to prevent their ex-PM being blown to bits? With the exception of some pre-credit titles explaining about the then on-going civil war in Sri Lanka, the film is not interested in any meaningful attempt at a socio-historical-political explanation of the bloody civil war which had been brewing since the 1950s and, up to the cease fire in the early 2000s, claimed hundreds of thousands of innocent lives.\n\nInstead director Shoojit 'Vicky Donor' Sircar is intent on making an unapologetic, almost propaganda piece with the clear intent of absolving the Indian authorities of any mismanagement in the build up to and the prevention of the assassination. This has been a contentious issue in India: a 1992 Commission Report concluded that security arrangements for Rajiv were adequate but blamed local Congress leaders for disrupting and breaching these arrangements.\n\nNo subsequent action was taken of the Report's recommendations but it looks like Sircar and his lead man (the film is co-produced by Abraham and there is an unconfirmed rumour it is funded by Sonia Gandhi!) have taken it upon themselves to dispute this finding. This cinematic liberty could be forgiven if the film itself was not so shallow with the complex conflict reduced to a straight 'cops n robbers shoot-em-up'. Sircar is clearly influenced by 'Apocalypse Now' with its iconic helicopters against the sun shot reproduced at one point.\n\nCharacterisation is also dosa-thin with Abraham's damaged victim persona conveyed via a bearded unshaven look. With the exception of the aforementioned 'Dhanu' (who did a lot!), the women have little to do. Sircar incorporates an unnecessary and clumsy 'kiss n sex' scene.\n\nSome dialogue ('this is going to be a long war!, 'the first causalities are always innocent civilians', 'this conversation never happened!', 'You cannot give up on the system!', and my favourite: 'He got honey trapped!\"), often repeated, is cringe worthy.\n\nThe film ends with Abraham reciting a famous Rabindranath Tagore poem ('When the mind knows no fear') but by this time you probably will not care.\n\nIf you are looking for Indian films which address, inter alia, events leading up to this sad event, it's probably worth seeking out Santosh Sivan's sensitive Tamil film 'The Terrorist' (1998), Mani Ratnam's moving Tamil hit 'Kannathil Mutthamittal' (2002) and even the Malayalam Mammooty potboiler 'Mission 90 Days' (2007).\n\nIt's welcome that Bollywood is experimenting with new bold controversial subjects like this.\n\nIt's a pity then that it gets it so wrong again.\n\nEven so, its fundamental flaws can even be forgiven (especially as there are no songs or 'item' numbers!). So, if you are interested in this aspect of history retold Bollywood simplistic-style, it may just be worth popping into this Madras Caf\u00e9."

Therefore, the viewer does not get a chance to judge/comment whether a particular actor did a good job or not ! This speaks volumes of the director's capability to tell the tale without making any person more important than the story !\n\nThroughout the 2 hours and 10 minutes of the film, one does not feel comfortable..although everyone knows the end. Shoojit was helped in his endeavor by excellent script, dialogues, cinematography, editing and music, all of superb quality. Persons responsible deserve all the kudos, but the biggest compliment goes the person at the helm. Shoojit Sircar has made a superbly crafted movie; and has jumped miles ahead of his contemporaries to become the best director of this generation.\n\nFor the audience who want quality cinema, here it is...go out in hordes and watch it, for \"Madras..\" deserves it much more than the poor cousin, \"Chennai...\", to show everyone you care for quality and not only for Express enjoyment that does not last."

Although I did not expect great acting.\n\nI have no clue why people have been rating it 9 or 10.

Nargis lives up to expectation this time and d\u00e9butant Reena's performance is very moving even though a brief one. Siddharth Basu is flawless.\n\nPolitically, there have been many protests on this movie about taking sides but if you watch it as viewer,Madras Cafe is one of the best movies to come out in Bollywood because of its different style of portraying the scenario.

It is a perfect example of spy-action-thriller in the backdrop of politics, revolution & patriotism. It provides hope to the Indian janta that movies in the lines of spy-crime genres of international is possible... finally!\n\nI am stunned by the story being so pure in its rawness. But am equally terrified by the ridiculous off-show narration. The editing is awful, so is the cinematography. Direction & music is well-taken care of. Special appreciation to the newcomers & forgotten/shadowed thespians like Siddharth Basu & Piyush Pandey as supporting cast. The theme which the movie slides itself is very deep & ubiquitous.\n\nJohn Abraham looks crude in his portrayal & is fine as the desi covert operation guy, Nargis Fakhri's accent truly supports her as a journalist; her role is one of the most important. The one man army idea & relationship tension are what I mean by stereotypes. Thank heavens, there is no pesky item songs or melodrama.\n\nAction is dull, due to the editing blunder. Setup is average as the first half focuses on action & prologue. Second half starts flat but emerges as a shiner giving its viewers enough food for thought about war, terrorism & revolution.\n\nWe have only heard about Operations & Intelligence. Madras Cafe serves it out with proper description. A humble 5.5 out of 10 for a good attempt. The credit song is fine, all right! And I was convinced enough to forget two goofs & one plot hole.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Many reasons to grab a seat in that nearby theater. And it wouldn't be fair not telling you that the 130 minutes of screenplay slightly does go off bounds, which MAY bore you. Watching it with like- minded partner or group will nullify this factor. Recommended!\n\nCan be watched with a typical Indian family?

Classic example being controversial Hollywood film JFK starring Kevin Costner and Gary Oldman which paved a way to lot of speculation. Madras Cafe has its own share of story which has been blunt and hard-hitting and yet hair-raising.\n\nSet in 90's , Madras Cafe debriefs the true story of planning and assassination of Indian ex-prime minister Rajiv Gandhi by LTTE suicide bomber which shocked the entire world and led to a Indian politics letdown.\n\nFrom critical acclaim films like Yahaan and Vicky Donor , Shoojit Sircar explores a new area which I guess no other Indian filmmaker has attempted till now and gives heart-wrenching political thriller which is sure to give you a goose bumps. It is sad to know that Indian Government was aware of Rajiv Gandhi's assassination but could not do much as he was already on his death path. The best part of the film is the crucial historical background narrated by Sircar rising to the conflict between Indian government and LTTE force in SriLanka. Every frame has been captured exotically and accurately. The best of all the scene is astonishing and well-shot assassination scene which had my heart pounding for a minute. Hats off to the Shoojit Sircar for directing it so well. Applaud for the cinematography for exclusive camera work. Art direction needs special mention. Editing is crispy. Script is the hero of the film. Once you are into the film , you will not know how the time flew. John Abraham completely surprises with his brilliant portrayal of Vikram Singh. He is sure to get acclaim for his riveting performance. Watch for him in climax scene. Siddharth Basu , Nargis Fakhri and other star cast lends a good support.\n\nOverall , Madras Cafe is heart-wrenching , reality-based political thriller that is going to get goose bumps.

Popular Hindi novelist Ved Prakash Sharma had written it and partly due to the hot theme and its brilliant treatment and partly due to the per-publication hype generation for it, the novel proved to be a bestseller Hindi novel in the pulp-fiction category. Though its author (Ved Prakash Sharma) has lost his sheen in the field of writing over the past few years, Vardi Waala Gunda (a goon in uniform) is still considered as one of his best works till date whose central character was a corrupt cop who masterminded the killing of the high profile politician of India who had attempted to bring about peace in the nation's neighbourhood but lost his own life in that.\n\nIn my humble opinion, neither the highly educated filmmakers nor the sophisiticated modern movie reviewers read Hindi novels, especially the pulp fiction stuff which is looked upon derogatorily. Hence I suppose that Shoojit Sircar, John Abraham and the various high profile reviewers writing reviews of this movie have not read this novel. But the quantum of similarity between the two is astonishing though the movie has been made by keeping a positive character at the nucleus of the story unlike the novel whose hero himself is actually the villain.\n\nAll the same, this is a very very well made one and deserves a lot of accolades for paying attention to the fine details, the realistic settings as well as the overall realistic approach in presentation, the excellent casting of actors for different characters (following the principle of horses for courses), creating that aura on the screen to mesmerize the audience for more than two hours and above all, establishing the futility of violence in a touching manner.\n\nThe story belongs to the ethnic trouble in Sri Lanka, the peace accord between the top political authorities of India and Sri Lanka, sending of IPKF (Indian Peace Keeping Force) to Sri Lanka and finally, the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi who was no longer the prime minister of India then. The story has been written by showing an Indian intelligence officer (John Abraham) at the centre of the various happenings, his pious intentions and sincere efforts for converting the dream of Rajiv Gandhi (of bringing peace to the island) into reality and most importantly, their failures. And when such things move on, double cross seems to be an unwritten rule of the game creating suspense for those who are in as well as for those who just watch.\n\nThe script-writer and the director has utilized the first half for the build-up of the main theme which takes the centre-stage in the second half only. However I opine that both the halves are equally important and well-presented. It's a brilliant blend of fact and fiction and it's utterly difficult for a layman like me to decide as to how much is the percentage of fiction in whatever is shown on the screen. The percentage may actually be high but the filmmaker has been successful in rendering a feeling to the audience that the greater amount is that of fact only. The flawed functioning style of the Indian bureaucracy has also been exposed very well.\n\nThe complete supporting cast has been selected with perfection and all have performed brilliantly. Simply superb. Utterly real in looks and behaviour. I have been a great admirer of quiz-master Siddharth Basu and it's a sheer delight to see him as an actor (the RAW chief). Nargis Fakhri (the British journalist) has improved since her debut in Rockstar (2011). Almost everybody is well in place with the sole exception of Raashi Khanna in her insignificant and unidimensional role of the hero's wife.\n\nNow for the hero-cum-producer John Abraham. In my humble opinion, he is not a versatile actor and his range is limited to certain kinds of expressions and roles. However he has a great screen presence and a highly impressive masculine personality. Since he is quite proficient in action-oriented intense roles, this role is tailor-made for him and he has excelled like anything. We can consider this performance of his as his best till date.\n\nMadras Cafe is not for the regular entertainment-seekers because this profound movie is low on entertainment quotient. It is for those who take interest in watching meaningful and realistic movies containing a great substance in the story."

I procrastinated on this movie a lot, despite getting multiple recommendations, but John Abraham was quite decent in this. The supporting cast was especially good and did the job really well. I was not privy to this story since it was before my time so it took a while to get into the nitty-gritty of it and the first half especially left me in a bit of a tizzy because of the info-dump. There were a lot of details and the violence was also a little difficult to stomach but the second half more than made up for it. It was thrilling and the background score made things even better. No unnecessary songs, although there were a couple clich\u00e9s here and there. I liked the way the subject was handled, with complete objectivity. Kudos to Shoojit Sircar. The man can deal with any kind of story, it seems. The second half gave a different kind of depth to the film and the countdown to the assassination was both scary and gripping. Recommended for conspiracy theorists and thriller enthusiasts."

Another great political espionage film after \"D-Day\". While it might not be as gripping, suspenseful, or action-packed as the \"D-Day\" (to be fair, this was never meant to be an action film), it certainly scores plenty of points for its realistic depiction of one of the most ghastly periods of Sri Lankan history and India's relation and unfortunate outcome with that period.\n\nThe film also needs praise for its accurate depiction of covert operations (again like \"D-Day\", this aspect is on par with the best spy films of international cinema), as also its brilliant technical achievements, especially the Cinematography and production design. Performance wise, John Abraham and Nargis Fakhri have certainly gone through the grind and come out as more than decent.\n\nShoojit Sircar has carved a grueling and gut-wrenching tale from actual facts with \"Madras Cafe\", that shouldn't be missed by any Indian."

        "review_detailed_main": "The events leading up to the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, India's ex-PM whilst he was campaigning for re-election in Sriperumbudur District, near Chennai in south India on 21 May 1991 by 'Dhanu', a female suicide 'Tamil Tiger', is the subject of this latest attempt at gritty political Bollywood cinema.\n\nTold largely in flashback, we follow Indian army officer Major Vikram Singh (John Abraham) who is appointed by the Research and Analysis Wing ('RAW'), the Indian equivalent of the CIA, to conduct covert operations in the then on-going civil war in Sri Lanka in the late 1980s.\n\nPatriotic Vikram ('My country's security is my responsibility!') leaves his teary but dutiful 'army' wife Ruby (Rashi Khanna, in her debut) and travels by boat from south India to the war-torn 'island of jewels'.\n\nEn-route, he encounters a no-nonsense (she smokes!) British journalist, Jaya (Nargis Fakhri, last seen in 'Rockstar'), who speaks with an inexplicable American twang.\n\nBoth are on the search for Anna (Ajay Bhaskaran) the leader of LFT which is clearly modelled on the real Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ('Tamil Tigers') who are fighting for a separate Tamil 'Eelam' ('homeland') for the Tamil minority away from the rest of the largely Sinhalese majority.\n\nVikram wants to eliminate Anna; Jaya simply wants a scoop! A plot to assassinate the ex-Indian PM is discovered ('decoded') but will Vikram be able to save the day and more importantly, did 'RAW' and the then Indian government do enough to prevent their ex-PM being blown to bits? With the exception of some pre-credit titles explaining about the then on-going civil war in Sri Lanka, the film is not interested in any meaningful attempt at a socio-historical-political explanation of the bloody civil war which had been brewing since the 1950s and, up to the cease fire in the early 2000s, claimed hundreds of thousands of innocent lives.\n\nInstead director Shoojit 'Vicky Donor' Sircar is intent on making an unapologetic, almost propaganda piece with the clear intent of absolving the Indian authorities of any mismanagement in the build up to and the prevention of the assassination. This has been a contentious issue in India: a 1992 Commission Report concluded that security arrangements for Rajiv were adequate but blamed local Congress leaders for disrupting and breaching these arrangements.\n\nNo subsequent action was taken of the Report's recommendations but it looks like Sircar and his lead man (the film is co-produced by Abraham and there is an unconfirmed rumour it is funded by Sonia Gandhi!) have taken it upon themselves to dispute this finding. This cinematic liberty could be forgiven if the film itself was not so shallow with the complex conflict reduced to a straight 'cops n robbers shoot-em-up'. Sircar is clearly influenced by 'Apocalypse Now' with its iconic helicopters against the sun shot reproduced at one point.\n\nCharacterisation is also dosa-thin with Abraham's damaged victim persona conveyed via a bearded unshaven look. With the exception of the aforementioned 'Dhanu' (who did a lot!), the women have little to do. Sircar incorporates an unnecessary and clumsy 'kiss n sex' scene.\n\nSome dialogue ('this is going to be a long war!, 'the first causalities are always innocent civilians', 'this conversation never happened!', 'You cannot give up on the system!', and my favourite: 'He got honey trapped!\"), often repeated, is cringe worthy.\n\nThe film ends with Abraham reciting a famous Rabindranath Tagore poem ('When the mind knows no fear') but by this time you probably will not care.\n\nIf you are looking for Indian films which address, inter alia, events leading up to this sad event, it's probably worth seeking out Santosh Sivan's sensitive Tamil film 'The Terrorist' (1998), Mani Ratnam's moving Tamil hit 'Kannathil Mutthamittal' (2002) and even the Malayalam Mammooty potboiler 'Mission 90 Days' (2007).\n\nIt's welcome that Bollywood is experimenting with new bold controversial subjects like this.\n\nIt's a pity then that it gets it so wrong again.\n\nEven so, its fundamental flaws can even be forgiven (especially as there are no songs or 'item' numbers!). So, if you are interested in this aspect of history retold Bollywood simplistic-style, it may just be worth popping into this Madras Caf\u00e9."

        "review_detailed_main": "From spine-chilling promos to stupendous campaigns, everything was so well crafted for Madras Cafe. This brings together the hit combo of director Shoojit Sircar and actor-producer John Abraham who wowed their detractors with the sleeper hit of 2012 -Vicky Donor.With Madras caf\u00e9, touted as one of the most compelling political thriller of recent times,Sircar examines the inexorable assassination of our Ex-PM, Rajiv Gandhi against the backdrop of the deadliest ethnic crisis which engulfed Srilanka during the 80's.\n\nRight from the outset, Sircar arrests your attention with the gritty and gloomy portrayal of the Srilankan civil war, the terrorist outfits and the responsive action by the Indian government to curb the growing violence. John Abraham plays Vikram Singh,an Intelligence officer,Ex- Indian Army man who is deployed by his senior RD(Siddharth Basu,in a towering performance)to the war-torn coastal island to break a resolute group , LTF headed by Anna Bhaskaran (Ajay Ratnam)modeled closely after the LTTE Chief,Prabhakaran.With the help of a British journalist,Jaya Sahni ( Nargis Fakhri in a de-glam role),Vikram uncovers a deeper conspiracy of terrifying proportion and ramifications involving political figures, bureaucrats and economic 'hitmen'.\n\nSuspenseful, sweeping and piercingly intimate, this is a complex web weaved by Sircar and his team of writers Shubhendu Bhattacharya and Somnath Dey which rapidly shuttles between our capital, Singapore, Bangkok and Kerela.There is a lot of clumsy high-powered conversations, coded messages, intercepts and bloody betrayals on the ground which might irk the viewer.DOP,Kamaljit Negi effervescently captures the moribund civilization of Jaffna and the war belt where humanity is endangered. The flabby second half shifts its focus to the machinations behind the assassination plot in a nail-biting thriller mode with a self-effacing background track(Shantanu Moitra)before settling in for a shocking explosion.\n\nWitnessing character outweigh the star persona in mainstream cinema is a rarity, but I did experience this with John Abraham's performance as the RAW agent. He effortlessly sinks into the character as the tough guy who is good with his guns in the mission, however could have done better in the emotional sequences involving his wife(ably played by Raasi Khanna).Sircar introduces some familiar faces like Siddharth Basu, Piyush Pandey who deliver as competently as the dichotomous superior of John, Bala(Prakash Belawadi).\n\nMadras Caf\u00e9 is indeed a commendable effort , considering its bold subject and the controversies and sensitivities built around it. A tour de force and an instant classic, this is Shoojit Sircar at the height of his dazzling repertoire."

LTF creation,peace force deployment,role of RAW and final assassination was perfectly brought on screen through the glass of RAW agent (though a fictional character you can't distinguish when fiction turns to reality, thanks to intelligent story telling).\n\nThe screenplay and cinematography was dot to the time frame. Linguistic dialogue were according to characters and situation which gives movie a feel of what it should be. Bringing out character of Bhaskaran (as pointed out by Jaya-Nargis Fakhri \"A man dedicated to cause and cannot be bought\") was crucial to the movie. So the final verdict is its a very apt political thriller encapsulating the actual historical event. Only thing boggles me is the the title \"Madras Cafe\" doesn't justify though i understand its a sensitive movie. Anyway everything else is just pure.\n\nJohn Abraham earned respect by investing (as producer and actor)in such risky (both in terms of money and subject) venture."

Screen play acts as a glue and you keep your jaws open for thrilling visuals which seem so real and possible. when you have action man like John , you always fear for unrealistic stunts , super hero fights and WIN WIN JAI India show.... but don't worry . this is not another Ek Tha Tiger. This movie has woven a brilliant script around a real incident and though you know what was happened ... then also it is greatness of #shoojitsircar which never makes it predictable. It is surely John' best movie considering his stone faced movie-history . John has got a gem called Shoojit sircar who has again amazed everybody with his second wonderful movie. It is hard to believe that same man have made a movie called Vicky Donor !!! Sircar has shown he is versatile and you can surely expect another different genre from him in future. All actors have done a fabulous job. Nargis Fakhri has not so big but impact giving role. No big stars were required for such movie when your movie is a big star. Unwanted songs , melodrama , love stories were away. You really need courage, confidence and belief to keep all masala away that \"public\" demands. It's not bad to watch masala entertainer but it's your duty to support such movies as they define our industry.\n\nSpend your valuable time i this cafe... and I promise it will be more valuable after watching it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Madras Cafe is a 2013 political thriller film directed by Indian filmmaker Shoojit Sircar, starring John Abraham as an undercover Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) agent and Nargis Fakhri as an international war correspondent. Madras Cafe presents a whole new perspective on the tragic Rajiv Gandhi assassination, believed to have been carried under the orders of the now deceased Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) chief Velupillai Prabhakaran, underpinning a whole new conspiracy angle to it.\n\nSo, what exactly is a conspiracy theory? Generally, whenever someone famous is assassinated (or, for that matter, in the occurrence of any other controversial event of national or international importance) the grapevine floods with loads of conspiracy theories. While every such theory is backed up by some sort of evidence, it is rarely concrete. Besides, if we were to go by the proponents of conspiracy theories, there are always powerful lobbies exercising their influence to keep such \"truths\" buried forever.\n\nWhile the genre is infantile when it comes to Hindi cinema, it's quite a successful formula in Hollywood. The fact that Madras Cafe is the first of its kind in India makes its success considerably important from cinematic point of view. Choosing to make a film on the sensitive and divisive subject of the LTTE takes courage, let aside realising a film that revolves around the Rajiv Gandhi assassination and throws in a brand new conspiracy theory angle to it. And the fact that films based on real-life sensitive issues and historical events in a country like India are believed to stir up political tension and cause chaos makes their effort even more commendable.\n\nOverall, Madras Cafe proves to be a great viewing experience for the serious audience. The film touches upon themes that are often considered quite challenging and difficult to tackle in Indian cinema parlance. The movie is at par with any Hollywood product on the technical front. The acting ranges from average to good. While Nargis Fakhri appears to be quite comfortable in her role, John Abraham undoubtedly delivers his best performance ever. Though he may not be as toned down as he himself claims to be, he seems to fit into the shoes of the character quite well and even manages to bring in a much needed element of realism and machismo to his part. While the movie doesn't appear to be taking any sides, its detractors may criticise it for implicitly creating a wave of sympathy for one political group in particular, especially with India's general elections fast approaching. Madras Cafe is a thinking man's espionage-cum-political thriller and is most likely to disappoint those on the lookout for voyeurism and masala entertainment. But, it's a movie that every serious film-goer must watch. 8/10\n\nA more in-depth review can be read at:\n\nhttp://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"

Nargis is pleasant in her role (perhaps as she did not have to speak Hindi), and isn't annoying like she was in Rockstar. All supporting actors do their job perfectly well.\n\nOne big problem with Madras Cafe is that if you're not political clued up, or necessarily find it interesting then you might lose interest in this film quite early. However, just like I did please go and watch until the end, especially for the climax scene as it is truly fantastic and teaches the younger generation like myself history about our great country India!"

I strongly believe that any person who watched this movie will generate a new found respect for Indian cinema.The movie is directed in such a way which can only be described as masterful.The use of strong imagery to show the consequences and horror of war is the most impressive feature in this movie which can even effect the most emotionally controlled person.To achieve this the camera work or the cinematography has been used in a really smart way which has added more depth to the images of war. I am not a fan of actors and actresses in Indian cinema however it has to be said that John Abraham and the supporting cast provide impressive performances which maintained the high quality of the movie. Overall this movie is a 1 st class movie which shows that the Indian cinema has gone to a level which is Oscar worthy."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's never easy to make and release a historic fictional movie in India where the majority of the audience spends money to watch dim-witted and romantic movies. The director and the actors have to be very competent and proficient to portray some historical events that still stir up jingoism among the people. Many Indians today are oblivious to the events and the reasons that ended up in the assassination of our former Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi but Madras Cafe has successfully thrown some light on this tragedy that is seldom heard of.\n\nMajor Vikram Singh, played by John Abraham is appointed by the RAW to handle the covert operations of the Indian Military at Jaffna and resolve the ongoing crisis created by the LTF resulting in genocide of the innocent people. The story is built upon the political tension that kept the Indian Ministry involved intensely to establish peace in Jaffna during the civil war. What we see in Madras Cafe is totally gripping- when Vikram Singh and Jaya, a foreign journalist exchange some significant and confidential information about the LTF and the leak in the Indian intelligence agency that actually results in a total transformation in the set of international events.\n\nJohn Abraham has acted exceptionally well in the character- who tries his best to embark upon the precarious struggle going on in Sri Lanka. Nargis Fakhri has shown some tremendous improvement in her acting and the 'No-Romantic loop' between them seems to work superbly for the movie. The movie moves very swiftly and the audience is engrossed for the entire duration of the movie. The cinematography is noteworthy and it is a well-scripted political suspense. For a story we already know, Madras Cafe is one of those that excels at creating a thriller, in a breath-taking manner.\n\nMadras Cafe definitely elevates John both as an actor and a director to a higher level. Shoojit Sircar hits the right strides and blends facts and fiction terrifically. The writers had done their research well. Debutante Rashi Khanna makes an impact in a brief but significant appearance as the army man's wife.\n\nMadras Cafe is a must watch for all those who want to know about the history behind the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, the LTTE etc. In two hours. It's effective and grim unlike the ludicrous drama and item numbers that incite cheers in the theater. It's definitely a brave move on the part of the director to come with such a movie and Madras Cafe is certainly a trend setter."

        "review_detailed_main": "undoubtedly one of the better films from bollywood in the recent times. probably the best political thriller in a long time. 'Madras Cafe' is unarguably a film that belongs to a rare genre of Bollywood cinema and it really deserves a little more attention and appreciation than what it's actually receiving.\n\nThe film is based on the backdrop of the Sri Lankan civil war in the late 1980's and early 1990's. It crosses its path with the plotting and assassination of the then, Indian Prime Minster, whom we understandably can make out as Late Mr. Rajiv Gandhi. This film is so well crafted; there was no visible loophole in the plot. a sensitive story was told in a fantastic way.\n\nfrom critical aspect, i thought the film lacked intensity the whole time. the kind of strong story it had, it could have been much much better. and casting was poor to some extent, specially some very lousy acting from some vital characters ruined some critical scenes. thanks to the director for not spoiling it with unnecessary songs!\n\noverall it was okay. comparing with other mindless masala-bolly films, its actually very good! john did his part, nargis fakhri was good. its the director's second film after vicky donor. so far so good."

This espionage drama/political thriller has decent story but screenplay is not up to the mark. Somewhere between historical timeline and a political conspiracy, it fails to maintain its coherence. It is somehow misses the elements which hold it together. That is the reason why it tastes your patience but fails to reward it. After the end, I felt it would have worked better as a documentary since characters fail to create an emotional bond. Even with such a realistic scenario and forcing elements, it does not create any tensed atmosphere or thrill.\n\nBut still it is at least an appreciative effort because of its subject and sincerity towards it. John Abraham tries his best. He and director Shoojit Sircar should be acknowledged. However, film does not stand tall on the basis of film-making."

        "review_detailed_main": "Some sections of the Indian media may be going gaga over the 'realistic', 'non-dramatic' film 'Madras Cafe' of Shoojit Sircar. Some have, rather shamelessly, compared it to Zero Dark Thirty \u2013 in reality, GI Joe: Retaliation is a more gripping watch. While the poor sense of aesthetics of these pseudo-critics is lamentable, their contempt for history as it happened leaves much to question.\n\nSelective history, grand conspiracy theory, not-so-subtle Indian patriotism all go into the making of a movie that principally exonerates India from all culpability of the brutal war crimes committed against the Tamils by the IPKF. From the start till the end, the subtext of the movie is to project India, a nuclear power state with the fourth largest army in the world, as a victim of the LTTE. For the record, at the height of the IPKF-LTTE war, over 100000 Indian soldiers armed to the teeth confronted about 3000 LTTE cadres. Despite this, India lost.\n\n\"They were powerful. In this game, we lost our prime minister, and the Lankan Tamils, their future,\" confesses RAW agent Vikram Singh (played by John Abraham) to a Christian priest. The entire movie is the confession of Vikram to the priest, from his activities as a RAW agent in IPKF occupied Jaffna, to the failure of the RAW to break the LTTE, to their failure to stop Rajiv Gandhi's assassination.\n\nThe numerous atrocities suffered by the Eelam Tamils under the IPKF, the murders, tortures, rapes and disappearances, do not form part of his confession. Thus, no mention of the same in the film. On the other hand, the reel LTTE are shown as fanatics, who even murder the wife of Vikram in India in their attempts to get to him. I am yet to hear of a single case where the real LTTE has deliberately targeted the family of officers or soldiers of even the genocidal Sri Lankan military.\n\nThe LTTE, shown in the film as Liberation of Tamils Front (LTF), are shown as some intransigent armed rebel group that has support of the local population. Why did the armed struggle come about, what did the Sinhala state do to create such a situation, why did the Tigers oppose the Indian solution of 13th Amendment, why did the Tamil people stand with the 'rebel group', and what did the IPKF actually do in the course of its intervention \u2013 these are questions not even considered by the filmmaker. But the words \"provincial council elections\" are repeated to the point of being a slogan throughout the movie. Contrast this with the bare minimal usage of the word 'Sinhalese' in the movie \u2013 it is as if they had no role to play at all. The tagline for the movie was \"Intercept the truth\"."

The story is based on the assassination of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi by the Tamil tigers and its about the whole conspiracy lies in between. Shoojit Sircar is the most underrated directors in Bollywood i must say. He knows the exact flow of a movie and to push it in which direction, in which way. John Abraham is very much realistic, and the other characters too. The background music, the screenplay, the photography each and everything is just perfect. the story is the main hero in this movie, so I don't want to compare it with my all time favourite Bourne series. But I must admit, this is India and we have a pathetic sensor board for whom The neo realism is absent in most of the Bollywood movies. I would like to thank the whole team of Madras Cafe for making such a bold film. Forget the usual craps of Bollywood and go watch this epic to taste something very much alike Hollywood, something very much fresh and solid without any hazy make up.\n\nAnd last but not the least, The poetry of Tagore \"Where the mind is without fear....\" respect. respect. respect."

        "review_title": "MADRAS CAFE - A well shot, focused attempt to make a fine political thriller which strictly lacks a lot for the common man.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Post a decent YAHAAN (2005) and a stalled project with Amitabh Bachchan called SHOEBITE, director Shoojit Sircar came up with a brilliant VICKY DONOR made on an unexpectedly bold yet highly entertaining subject widely acclaimed all over in the year 2012. So after such a confident success, planning his next movie as an intense spy thriller was indeed a very bold and daring step, for the kind of audience who are not really known to appreciate this particular genre in a big way since decades.\n\nSo at one end, MADRAS CAFE has some notable merits to its credit worth praising. It fairly adds to the bright welcome change ignited by the recent success of D-DAY exploring the rarely attempted genre of spy thrillers. It is no doubt a courageous (as well as risky) choice of subject for John Abraham as one of the producers. The film talks about an important, shattering assassination of an ex-Indian Prime Minister never depicted on the screen before. It has been written and directed with a completely focused vision without inserting any thrown in love angle, an untimely song (it's a song less movie as it should be) or spoon feeding as normally seen in the routine Hindi films. It very aptly points towards the money lobby working behind all the major drastic events of the world. The performances don't care about their short or long lengths and try to do full justice to their respective roles. It has a splendid cinematography (great civil war sequences) and a fine background score reminding you of many foreign spy movies made in the realistic style. And with a sharp, intelligent editing it never gives you any dragging moment in its more than 2 hours of duration and has an engaging climax conceived well.\n\nHowever on the other hand, MADRAS CAFE hasn't got that pace, thrills and shocking twists essentially required as the key features of such political thrillers. It keeps progressing in a documentary style without taking any sides like a well researched feature. But the facts incorporated in its script are sure going to face some hard criticism from different section of viewers as it seems. The film begins impressively and keeps explaining its basic premise of the Sri Lankan conflict for too long. As a result the viewers sitting in the theater expecting some high paced action-adventure from John Abraham start getting disappointed. Moreover with no deliberate build up for the main wanted man authorities are looking for, the excitement is missing and one doesn't find himself pulled in any chase or attack sequences quite frankly.\n\nPost intermission when it all become clear about the big historical assassination the film is heading towards, suddenly the suspense is all lost since we already know what is going to happen next and there is no guessing left for the viewers. And further when it all happens exactly like it is expected too, one walks out of the theater with an impression of having seen something good & well attempted but nothing exceptional in terms of return for the ticket bought. Hence its pretty obvious that MADRAS CAFE is strictly not for the smaller centers and is going to struggle at the single screens theaters for sure. Plus it may also get a mixed kind of response at the multiplexes too as there are not many who would be willing to buy a costly ticket for a political thriller made on the Sri Lankan conflict. So where a particular section of viewers may find themselves praising the movie a lot, many others are not going to consider it worth their time and money spent. And that's exactly why I would like to call it as a film not really for 'the common man', a phrase used by Shahrukh in his latest money grosser.\n\nRegarding performances, MADRAS CAFE has John Abraham honestly putting all his efforts to fulfill the director's requirements but I seriously found his confession in the get up of a lost (retarded kind of) bearded man quite weird and unexplainable since there was no fault of his in all those tragic incidents. Nargis Fakhri perfectly plays the role of a foreign war correspondent and the move of using her complete dialogues in English (with Hindi subtitles) is sure going to prove as a big downer in the centers other than the metros. Sidhhartha Basu plays the media expert superbly and Prakash Belawadi is impressive as the cunning mole working against the government. Rashi Khanna doesn't get much to do as John's wife and Ajay Ratnam fails to make any solid terrifying impact as Anna.\n\nIn all, MADRAS CAFE is a good watch if you are really fed up with the usual Bollywood stuff repetitively being served by the big names. Its unarguably one of the better attempts to make an enlightening political thriller, but could have been a lot more with some high paced, engaging and unpredictable twists used in its basic structure. At times a little dramatization of the real life happenings add to the overall impact hugely and completely refraining from them makes the end product quite raw and tasteless. And I personally missed that delightful taste sitting in Shoojit's MADRAS CAFE this Friday but still would like to recommend it to all thoughtful viewers strongly."

        "review_detailed_main": "John Abraham produced and acted Madras Cafe had been the talk of the town much before it was released, and much of the talk arising from the sensitive and controversial theme it had.\n\nShoojit Sircar, who previously directed the critically acclaimed Yahaan and the over-rated Vicky Donnor helms Madras Cafe. Thankfully, Sircar handles Madras Cafe with utmost care not to overdo the war or the assassination finale. It was indeed a bold move. The movie's first half packs a punch and a lot had been squeezed into it, be it the civil war or the politics that was in play behind all the events. And the same had been narrated via cut shots and collages. The pacing too was brisk leaving no time to take in breath, inducing a kind of grim feel consistently till the end. It essentially had that Hollywood vibe thanks to the brilliant cinematography by Kamaljeeth Negi.\n\nThe first half of the movie was concentrated on the dreary happenings of Sri Lanka and it did have a huge impact on me as a viewer though the second half was focused more on the Rajiv Gandhi Assassination which took off some of tension that was built up in the first half. I do know that it was inevitable but much of my interests were invested on events we had not known about than a tragedy which we were familiar with.\n\nGlad to see John Abraham playing a no-frills-attached espionage agent and felt he'd done justice to the role without the usual bells and whistles of a Bollywood hero. Total thumbs down to Nargis Farkhri. All she did was pout and brung nothing to what could have been an otherwise prominent role. Special mentions include Sidhartha Basu's impeccably portrayed Robin Dutt aka RD and Prakash Belawadi's Bala. Being a Mallu it'd be iniquitous if I don't mention Dinesh Nair a multi-talented actor who played the role of Rajasekharan. Debutante Rashi Khanna makes a mark on the audience playing a charming Ruby who comes off as a bit more adept than Nargis Fakhri.\n\nA more reminiscent comparison would be Santhosh Sivan's Theeviravaathi: The Terrorist which managed to depict a very violent theme in a non- violent and subtle manner bringing in the same kinda grim feel throughout. While it was the terrorists inner conflicts that was shown there, here we have a look at the nuances of an agent stranded amidst personal tragedies and obligations towards his nation.\n\nWhat Madras Cafe does best is the visualization of war and makes a point where its not always guns and action. There are casualties of course but apart from that there are also the dreaded memories of events leading to and following a war which forever scars a nation, a continent and the world."

Apart from that, the film does a great disservice to the Tamil population in Sri Lanka's Northeast who have undergone great sufferings at the hands of both Indian and Sri Lankan Governments. Bollywood stars are poor actors, at best, they are a bunch of phonies. Further, they should focus on subject matters they are good at such as comedy, and cheap love stories."

You need not act funny to make up for bad scripts in movies. Shoojit Sircar had a clear direction, pace of movie to narrate this sequence of events that led to one of the biggest disaster in Indian politics and its relation to Sri Lankan civil war. Politics, patriotism, action, betrayal, conspiracy, espionage - all form a essential ingredients to make this movie a great entertainer which leaves an lasting impression in viewers mind.

Although sometimes it felt as if we watched 2 movies in 2 halfs(before & after interval) & felt that d movie went in another direction after interval...but it wasn't actually that way.\n\nThis is the 1st Bollywood movie which has such a great & extraordinary CINEMATOGRAPHY scene after scene. The beauty is that even when the audience knows that what has to happen in the end The director still holds us to the movie.\n\nIt can be said now that filmmakers in India can boldly make real-life stories without fear of controversy or censorship, this may be the best way to approach important stories that must be told."

        "review_detailed_main": "Madras Caf\u00e9 ,directed by Shoojit Sircar ,whose Vicky Donor won the hearts of both the audiences and the critics, which is a really difficult job to do in our country. He, with Madras Caf\u00e9 steers into difficult waters .Espionage thrillers are rare in Hindi, and the ones made do not even deserve to be called thrillers. Here he not only manages to deliver a gritty espionage thriller, but does that with non-actors like John Abraham and Nargis Fakhri. Rajiv Gandhi's assassination serves as a vantage point in this film and the build up to the event is shown in its gritty reality. The film starts off with Vikram (John) visiting a church in Kasauli and doing a confession there, and in the process acts as a narrator to this film.The backdrop of sectarian politics in Sri Lanka is explained ,the crimes against the minority Tamils by the ruling Sinhalese is shown with shocking reality. Then the film goes on from one point to another.Indian politics is shown inside out.Nargis acts out the role of a war journalist. The occasional tribute to Apocalypse Now was fantastic for the film lover. Acting wise ,only Siddhartha Basu 's role was noteworthy."

John Abraham surely needs many pats on his back for producing movie like Vicky donor and Madras Cafe. Brilliance of this movie lies in its grand canvas and realistic backdrop. This is perhaps first Indian movie which is very near to any war movie of Hollywood, as far approach is concern. Script is near perfect. Most of the actors have performed well. John Abraham has suited the role perfectly.Controlled direction, Good cinematography and tight editing add to the mood of this movie. Over all fantastic one from JA."

This movie reminded me of the Bourne Series more than once and pays silent tribute to Hollywood style film making. Talking from acting point of view, it seems John has kept his best for 2013. After Shoutout at Wadala, John undoubtedly provides his career best performance with this one. Well then again the role of the RAW agent was tailor made for him. Siddhartha Basu deserves special mention as the the guy with the brains provides the sense of calmness in this fast paced assassination plot.Nagris Fakhri seemed at ease with her British English Accent though a lot of improvement is still required as per her acting abilities. Last but not least, hats off to Soojit Sarcar for pulling this off. Golden Times Ahead."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is an excellent topic to pick up - assassination of a leading political figure. Bollywood, sadly, feels the need to balance its traditional need for glamour with realism demanded by the script. This is where Madras Cafe falls short.\n\nPositives - Good concept, an honest attempt to make realistic cinema, no song and dance (as demanded by the script), good pace Negatives - Sheer lack of homework (Sri Lankans speaking Tamil with Chennai accent, English woman speaking in American accent,Army officer reporting at Head Office unshaven, wearing glamorous clothes while undercover) Poor acting - John Abraham is wooden and cannot go beyond stock expressions. Nargis Fakhri is terrible. Neither does the role offer much glam quotient and nor does she act. She sticks out like a sore thumb. Editing - Too sketchy; especially in the meeting scenes. Frames move very fast without any pauses for thinking.\n\nSummary - For regular cinema goers who prefer good cinema but end up watching slapsticks or poorly made movies, Madras Cafe will come across as a quality watch - a definite upgrade on the Golmaals and Singams of the world. For those who are more selective with their movies, this will disappoint."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is frankly one of the best movies made this year. Very fast paced and realistic thriller.\n\nOne of the problems I see in Bollywood is EVERY movie involves escapist cinema. While such over the top action/comedy movies are nice to be savored once in a while, every other movie being made in the same fashion makes it stale.\n\nNow Shoojit Sircar (director of Vicky Donor) gives us another mind blowing movie with Madras Cafe. Its down to earth approach and realistic blend of fact + fiction (regarding Rajiv Gandhi assassination) leaves cinema goers like me extremely satisfied. I have seen such carefully nuanced film making in 'Body of Lies', 'Green Zone' and 'Bourne' movies. But never have I seen such a fine political thriller in Bollywood (Shanghai was close though!). I was really anxious as to whether the movie would live up-to the expectations. Or if the director would Bollywood-ize the movie for the sake of box office. Thankfully, the movie steered clear of such typical Bollywood clich\u00e9s; and delivered a thriller that's gracefully raw and appealing.\n\nJohn Abraham gives the best performance till date. Nargis Fakhri also gives a nice performance as a foreign-based Indian reporter. I must commend the director for giving 100% English dialogs (with Hindi Subtitles) to Nargis who carried it out perfectly. However, it's Prakash Belawadi who leaves an impression as John's superior Bala.\n\nAll in all, the movie is very swift and well made, and also throws some light on the ambiguous relation Indian maintained with Sri-Lanka. If you are looking for a masala movie, this movie is not for you. Devoid of even a single comic moment, this movie is strictly for viewers who like taut political thrillers. If you liked Green Zone, Body of Lies and Blood Diamond, this is must go for you as you'll see Bollywood like never before."

The producers must be applauded for taking the chance and Madras Cafe is a tight movie with some good editing. However, the main problem is the performance of John Abraham, who is playing an Army Soldier. The acting leaves a lot to be desired and it is one of the disappointing aspects of this movie. It is nice to see movies that are not mindless and require the viewer to be attentive. There are no songs that break out of nowhere which is a relief. The action sequences could have been better considering the number of killings that occurred in Sri Lanka during the period. My overall rating of this movie is 7/10 and I recommend this to those who like movies having a storyline instead of the usual Masala Movies that are dominant in Bollywood."

        "review_detailed_main": "Simple justification to a portion of nutritious meal for the grey stuff of India. Shoojit Sarcar's third release , after his charming comedy Vicky Donor; has more in common with Sarcar's first one, Yahaan which was set in Kashmir. Seems like Indian cinema is finally taking a leap over pragmatic evolution with the film to be set in the 1980s in the backdrop of the Tamil civil war in Sri Lanka. Right dozes of thrill and politics are tried to be brewed up by Shubendu and Somnath (scriptwriters) to create the chapter. Lush rain forests and twilit helicopter flights in the world are synchronized with the subject. The only gaping hole to some extent is that the script feels simultaneously convoluted and simplistic sometimes. There is a sense of loss in interest in the actual content of Sinhala-Tamil politics. However script is rightly sorted and filtered attempt in order to make a daring creative move to acknowledge Hindi cinema with a messy civil war tale that most Hindi film viewers know a little about. Courage of its unusual political subject, non heroic antics and attempted realism are the points to be feted over and about. Nargis Fakhri clearly act businesslike journo and John portrays a somewhat flatly emotional RAW agent. Thankfully the oldest trick of Hindi movie book - star crossed romance is kept far away. Vikram's wife Ruby, seems a promising actor, but we learn nothing about her except that she's anxious about her husband's safety. Ruby is a one-note character and her departure goes un-lamented. Familiar faces from the Delhi theatre world have done due justice \u2013 Avijit Dutt, Sudhanva Deshpande, Jayanta Das and Swaroopa Ghosh (both of whom also acted in Vicky Donor, as Yami Gautam's father and pishi respectively) and most interestingly, Siddharth Basu. Basu as Vikram's super-boss Robin Dutt and Kannada theatre person Prakash Belawade as the hard-drinking agent Bala are the only ones to leave anything close to an impression. What really makes this film fall flat is the vagueness of its central dramatic thread \u2013 Tamils in Madras Caf\u00e9 die as innocents and kill as guerrillas, but what are they dying and fighting for? That is never really explored, politically or emotionally. At the end of the film, Vikram is still going on about how he could have saved \"our Prime Minister\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I was first introduced to fiction from Fredrick Forsyth and his many peers who have written some delightful political thrillers based on real life events, I was enthralled by their detailing and real life political setting as well as the oft blurred lines between fact and fiction, so much so, I used to refer to them FACTion and not mere fiction. While Hollywood and international cinema churn out political thrillers and dramas based on real life events in regular intervals, the best we ever get from mainstream Bollywood and regional language movies are the occasional biopics. Dramas or thrillers based on real life political events have been an arena where contemporary Indian cinema had clearly feared to tread.\n\nDirector Shoojit Sircar's Madras Cafe ventures into such a sphere and presents an interesting thriller set in the background of civil war in Sri Lanka during the late eighties and the early nineties. It weaves a fictionalised account of the political conspiracy that eventually culminated in the assassination of the former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi.\n\nThe movie has a quirky beginning with a dishevelled, dazed and drunk John Abraham in a hill station recounting the events to a priest which unfold as a flashback. John plays Vikram Singh, an army officer working with Reasearch & Analysis Wing (RAW). It is the late eighties when India had signed a peace accord with the island nation and had sent in the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) to Sri Lanka to restore peace and assist in a peaceful political transition in the Tamil areas of the north and the east by disarming the rebels. However, they have to confront the powerful Tamil rebel group called LTF headed by the Anna Bhaskaran (an aptly cast Ajay Ratnam) who is keen to continue the armed struggle for an independent Tamil homeland, for he fears that if they accept disarming, the locals will be decimated after the withdrawal of IPKF. Vikram is sent to the Jaffna to work under Bala (Belawade) to ensure that the peace process succeeds and there is a peaceful political transition through popular elections. To this end, he tries to weaken Anna's & LTF's stranglehold over the region by providing covert support to outsiders as well as dissenters within the LTF. Vikram is helped by Jaya Sahni (Nargis Fakhri), a London based war correspondent who provides him with some vital clues. However, he is ignorant of the many undercurrents of betrayal at play and is forced to return to India after a failed operation. Consequently, Anna and LTF eliminate all their opponents and emerge the strongest force in the region. Shift in political dynamics in India & Sri Lanka result in an ignominious exit of the IPKF from Sri Lanka. However, when the political winds of change blowing in India indicate the return to power of the former prime minister, whom Anna fears could jeopardise his ongoing struggle, he resorts to pre-empt that situation and conspires to assassinate him. There is also an element of international conspiracy that seeks to profit by perpetuating strife in the region. The rest of the movie is a race against time where Vikram and his colleagues unravel the conspiracy and attempt to foil the plans of Anna and his assasins.\n\nThe movie takes some time to set up the context and these early portions lack in pace and are listless. However, the movie finds it soon after the scene shifts to Sri Lanka and some tighter scripting and crisp editing sets up a pulsating second half which is set as a race against time. The cinematography is excellent throughout and provides an authentic feel to the unfolding events. Shantanu Moitra's score sets an apt tone for the proceedings and elevates the intensity of the events in the second half.\n\nJohn Abraham has done a good job in the role that requires a restrained performance. Nargis Fakhri seems adequate in a cameo of an English speaking international war corrspondent. The other roles have been aptly cast - be it Ajay Ratnam as Anna or Sidhartha Basu as Robin Dutt, the RAW chief or Belavade as Bala - and their performances are competent.\n\nOn the flip side, the movie appears a bit muddled in some portions where the events appear to unfold in a haze. Also, the portions between John and his wife (Rashi Khanna), though included to portray him as a normal person, could have been edited out as they slacken the pace without adding any significant heft. Also, Vikam's retelling of the events as a flashback to a priest in a hill station appear to serve no useful purpose.\n\nNevertheless, John Abraham as a producer as well as the lead and Shoojit Sircar deserve much credit for the mere fact that they chose to make such a movie and explore an hitherto unexplored terrain for Indian mainstream cinema. It is also no mean feat that they have managed to pull off this ambitious enterprise quite successfully without succumbing to the several cliched compromises of Bollywood such as making the hero to pull off Bond/Bourne like stunts (Ek tha Tiger or Agent Vinod), jarring jingoism which paints the other side as pure evil (Gadar, Border, et al).\n\nDespite being a movie set in the background of a war, Madras Cafe does not take sides; Nor is it a movie that overly focuses on its main lead. The protagonist here is merely one of the key players in the plot which has several layers of intrigues that he has to grapple with. The unfolding political conspiracy remains the unflinching focus of the movie and it underlines the theme of futility war which begets devastates both winners and losers.\n\nOverall, Madras Cafe, despite a few flaws, is an audacious venture and presents a taut thriller which is authentic in equal measure. Both, John Abraham as producer and Shoojit Sircar as the director deserve plaudits for such back-to-back (after Vicky Donor) projects which raise the bar for Indian cinema. If only, we, as a nation, could grow to appreciate and encourage such efforts without expressing umbrage, we can hope to see more such meaningful entertainers. If only ...."

        "review_detailed_main": "One of the best movie's of Bollywood.Every Indian should know the facts that has been shown in this movie. Shoojit Sircar's Madras Cafe starring John Abraham and Nargis Fakhri is not just another typical Bollywood masala flick but is a thought provoking, heart touching political drama. It's a film that will keep you and your eyes glued to the seat and the screen, effortlessly. Sircar has given meaty roles to all his characters and not just the leads.\n\nThe opening scene of Madras Cafe showcases khoon kharaba and merciless killing of innocent people. The scene then effectively moves on to the present where we see John in despair trying to overcome his sorrows with alcohol. Our hunkalicious drunken John Abraham (Vikram Singh) then visits a church where he recalls the blood-curdling tales of the Lankan wars and then the flashback begins. From here, the film takes us back to the 1980's and is set against the backdrop of Sri Lankan wars.\n\nJohn Abraham is a military officer who's ordered to carry out covert operations in Sri Lanka during the rise of Anna Bhaskaran (played by Ajay Rathnam ), the leader of a fictitious rebel group LTF. On John's arrival in the war struck country, he meets Nargis Fakhri (Jaya) who is a British war correspondent. No, there isn't any filmy style 'love at first sight' that evolves between the two. We're glad that Sircar has delivered his film with practicality. What we notice is that, while John speaks in Hindi, Nargis responds in English. Maybe she could've delivered at least one Hindi dialogue, but we aren't complaining. We guess the Rockstar babe got her acting right because she spoke a language that she's well-versed with\u0085 Moving on, during John's stay in Sri Lanka a lot unfolds including a tragic death, followed by double crossing, kidnapping and many more twists.\n\nWhile being engaged in the politics involved, it's quite apparent that Sircar hasn't ignored the importance of relationships in a person's life. Newbie Rashi Khanna (Ruby Singh), who plays John's wife in the film doesn't have a lot of screen presence but all the same she serves her purpose. Sircar has delicately portrayed the kind of relationship that a military officer has with his wife and how the love for our own country overshadows any other kind of love\u0085\n\nThroughout the film, we're aware that there's going to be an assassination. Despite knowing it's going to happen, we still dread the scene and hope against hope that John saves the day. However, Shoojit knows what he's doing and ensures that John only plays a hero and not some larger-than-life superhero in the film. We love the way Sircar has facilely designed a realistic fiction film!\n\nThe cinematography is mind blowing with terrific visualisations and sound effects. Nothing is overdone in the film. Madras Cafe sticks to its genre and remains a political thriller throughout the film without romance, item numbers, vulgarity and unnecessary skin show. Music by Shantanu Moitra is pleasing to the ears. The film isn't force-filled with unnecessary naach gaana just to add a romantic factor and we totally love that!\n\nThe film ends with an intriguing thought, who really won the war. It keeps us pondering for a while that nobody gains at the end of a war, there's only loss\u0085 As the narration ends, the beautiful track Maula Sun Le Re starts playing. Hmmm\u0085 Is John asking the Lord to listen to his pleas for his film to work? He surely doesn't need that for this film to work as it's the best political thriller that Bollywood has ever se"

Hatching a plot to bring down Anna, a popular Tamil leader in the zone, Vikram begins with trying to team up with Anna's opponents in the beginning.\n\nFalling prey to a leak, he loses his first shot with Anna and gets kidnapped by his forces! However, now hell bent on getting Anna to bow down, he teams with Anna's own men and manages to ambush his army. However, Anna manages to survive and returns even more powerful by eradicating Indian forces off Jaffna and Lanka.\n\nPlotting ways to kill the former Indian Prime Minister fearing that he will return to power, the film is a tussle between the war makers to safeguard their interests! And for Vikram, it is the story about how India lost its Prime Minister in an assassination which the nation has still not forgotten!\n\nPerformances: John Abraham as Vikram Singh topples all his previous performances. He isn't a very flattering actor but his clever choice of role and wicked acting surely shows a remarkable improvement. He isn't the John who couldn't emote. He is the John who isn't afraid to take up challenging roles and carry them out gracefully.\n\nNargis Fakhri with her British accent is pitch perfect. She may not be a show stealer but does her bit with \u00e9lan retaining the correct persona for it.\n\nSiddhartha Basu is quite a natural as he smoothly slips in the role of R.D. His intelligence shows in his eyes, and he manages to command respect in his character! Never stepping a wrong stone, the man should have taken up acting long back!\n\nThe supporting actors are all impressive but in the end, this film is more about its intent and plot than about its actors!\n\nDirection,editiong,screenplay & music:Shoojit Sircar is back after a long hiatus since Vicky Donor. He strings into the same plot, the emotional wreckage and physical devastation of war to emphatically put forth the futility of it all. In the climax, Shoojit concludes with, \"One man's revolutionary is another one's villain!\" followed by a few stellar lines of Tagore! Truly, in the clashes of mindsets the only people who suffer are commoners who seek only peace and happiness from their lives.\n\nAs Lankan leader Anna strives to garner power and Indian Government attempts to achieve their political motive of maintaining monopoly in the subcontinent by maintaining friendly relations with Lanka to obtain access into the South East Asia, Sircar wonderfully relates the story of anarchy, bloodshed and meaningless war which continued for 27 long years killing thousands. In the end, he does squeeze out a potent message about the nugatory nightmare of the wrath of war! Shoojit intelligently executes a crisply written story which is executed breathtakingly. The editing of the film is quite well done, as the docu-drama style doesn't stir up any boredom. Shantanu Moitra's music is pristine and haunting as the climax wraps up with Papon crooning Maula Re.\n\nThe last word: Madras Caf\u00e9 is a hypnotically created masterpiece which thrives in the freshness of its conception. Using history with drama to build a persuasive tapestry of enthralling action, energetic plot and skillful narration of the grim phase of Lankan War, Shoojit Sircar astonishes with this fascinating docu style dramatic movie. I am going flatly with a 9/10 this triumphed work of passionate and compelling cinema."

        "review_detailed_main": "Let's get one thing out of the way before I delve into that half baked dish called \"Madras Cafe\" ; its a commendable effort coming from mainstream Bollywood that needs to watched and encouraged and yadda yadda yadda.......\n\nNow this is where Bollywood goes and shoots itself in the foot. They set out with this grand and lofty ambition of making a different kind of a movie, not a 3 hour mindless song, dance and dishum dishum spectacle, a political thriller no less, and yet predictably end up with egg all over their face . Entirely because they neither have the required competency in story telling nor in story enacting, the two vital components which Hollywood has mastered when it comes to war movies/political thrillers (think Argo, Platoon, Z, The Manchurian Candidate etc).\n\nShoojit Sircar's \"Madras Cafe\" is a stupidly simplistic, glossing over the facts, adolescent comic book take on the vexed, complicated, multi layered, half a century old Tamil \u2013 Sinhala strife in SriLanka. Oh did I say Tamil \u2013 Sinhala strife? I am so sorry; the move couldn't care less about that at all. What the movie cares about is how the civil war was actually fought between the good guys - RAW (Research and Analysis Wing) of India vs the bad guys - LTTE (rechristened as Tamil Liberation Front, TLF, in the movie) of SriLanka in which \"innocents\" like Rajiv Gandhi were simply collateral damage. This is where the script writers Shubhendu Bhattacharya & Somnath Dey must take all the flak. Their joint venture script is so amateurish, so full of loop holes and loose ends that it almost reads like a dumbed down Facebook status update that a school going teenager might put up on the Srilankan civil war.\n\nCinematographer, Kamaljeet Negi, appears to be under strict instructions to give the war scenes of the film close resemblance to those of \"Apocalypse Now\", \"Platoon\" and \"The Thin Red line\".\n\nAdd to it, the unimaginative direction of Sircar (he falls back upon the background voice over narrative ever so often for the sake of us imbecilic audiences ) whereby he thinks he is being clever but ends being too convoluted for his own good. However, clearly the worst part of the movie is rank bad acting all around with lead actor John Abraham taking the cake. Abraham is so flat, monotonous and stiff that even when he hugs his wife passionately you think a mannequin could have done it better. Siddharth Basu, as the RAW chief acts like he is still the quizmaster shooting questions at the hapless contestants. If I have to admit that the undisputed Queen of bad acting, Nargis Fakhri, is the most outstanding act of this movie you get the extent of poor histrionics this movie has to offer.\n\n\"Madras Cafe\" is an intellectually vapid and dishonest film masquerading as a political thriller while it would have easily passed off as a pro Rajiv Gandhi propaganda film made by the Congress party in an election year."

I have never seen such skillful handling of a Political/Military Plot by any Indian Director for the Indian Audience, its a wake-up call to grow up to quality films, this one\n\nThe set-up seemed a little too up-to-date to resemble a scenario of late 80s (we can take inspiration from SPECIAL 26 for a better background set-up)\n\nA lot of elements were kept in ambiguity, but i would take it that those were intentionally done to spice-up the plot.\n\nJohn Abrahm and Nargis were both handled by the director delicately keeping in mind their respective limitation. John though is turning out to be a revolutionary figure in Indian Film\n\nCould have stretched the Assassination part a bit to make more logical.\n\nI found some glitch with regards to the timelines- in a few parts, the timeline seemed to be too ambiguous, but for such a brave and brilliant attempt this was a very minor miss.\n\nOnly issue was every other Sri Lankan and even the Thai people could speak Suddh Hindi, but come on this is far better that what we pay and see."

        "review_detailed_main": "Shoojit Sircar, known for directing unconventional movies(Vicky Donor, Yahaan) has come with his new outing \"Madras Cafe\". Movie was in buzz from the day it was announced creating controversies all around it. Is it that Controversial to get banned? Well let me say, many people have different opinions on this film, but the fact is THIS FILM HAS SHOWN THE TRUTH! Shoojit has perfectly blended fiction with true events. And the most interesting part is that its not FICTION but The TRUTH which has created this much controversies. Set in mid 1980's, this film is based on Civil War in Srilanka, LTTE's role in assassinating Ex-PM Rajiv Gandhi. John Abraham, actor-producer, has done a fantastic job playing R&AW agent. He has proved that he can act in mainstream Cinema as well. Nargis Fakhri, as journalist, is efficient. Screenplay is aptly done. But plot holes are there. And the major one can be a blunder! John knows about the plastic bomb through the scientist in a scene, but he doesn't informs about the bomb to RD! This plot-hole must have been avoided. Well many of them may not have noticed that as the screenplay is so tight that you will sit at the edge of the seat till the conclusion! This film is all the way better than many political thrillers! I will love to say that you should enter this caf\u00e9 and see the history in the most stylish way ever. RECOMMENDED!"

It is great that it is close to 50 cr mark, one sixth of the business of the \"Chennai Express\", only it is six times better movie than that! I also didn't realize why it was so much hue and cry around this great movie, can't we call a terrorist organization simply a \"terrorist organization\" which carried out the assassination of one of our country's PM whatever their belief is? Politics have become so cheap! Hats-Off to Shoojit Sircar, for being realistic and not crafting another superman fantasy about RAW agents. He was so brave that one of the most important characters(Nargis) playing a journalist spoke \"fluent English\" all through the movie which is exact match for an NRI journalist. It is unbelievable in the era of \"Item Number\" and \"Silly Jokes\" the movie doesn't have one single song, except the concluding one. John was good, specially his expressionless expression on the account of his personal tragedy was touching, it reminded me of Ajay Devgan in \"Zaakham\" or \"Hum Dil De Chukay Sanam\". But the real hero of the movie is the \"Script\", it was so intense, you can hardly relax your eyes looking elsewhere other than the screen! Must watch! I am hoping \"Satyagraha\" will be even better, review coming soon."

First, the war conditions in Jaffna and then the assassination plot.In between shocking plots are revealed and it covers a vast script in its run time. Talking about Nargis her accent is good but should have done hard work on her acting skills and presentation, John is no more expression less actor.HE worked extremely hard in his recent projects and proved him.And he is at his best in Madras Cafe, It is a non Bollywood style movie where we find no songs, dancing and other commercial boring stuff etc. There is no stupid romantic situation in the movie which other Indian political movies show. hats off to Soojit Sircar for pulling this off, i highly recommend this movie to all and i am glad that, this movie is going to be tax free, I will thank to this movie creative team which done a fabulous job to make every sec. of this movie interesting.. it is a 130 min of mind blowing drama and unexpected thriller which is a good thing, go enjoy \"MADRAS CAFE\". And witness Bollywood like never before........."

Truly now everyone takes him seriously rather than earlier times. soorjit right from his first movie..than came Vicky donor(unconventional subject for Indian market but it worked wonders) This is the first documentary which reminded me of Green zone, hurt locker experience while watching..Nargis (super accent to start with)if she had debuted with this movie in Bollywood it would have been the best decision nevertheless awesome movie, superb performance and shot extremely well."

He may not be exceptional, but he has done a very good job. Non Professional actors such as Siddhartha Basu and Dibang are terrific. Nargis Fakhri really delivers a good performance with her British accent. Supporting Cast is also really good.\n\nDirection : Now what can I say Shoojit Sircar is really a man to watch.

Set in a time when different sections of people had different views and opinions regarding terrorism, this well crafted movie has by far outdone any other movie in this genre.

Editing of the movie is good too, cutting unnecessary romantic/emotional scenes (which Bollywood movies are generally culprit of), making it a decent paced thriller. Though, I believe editing could have been better, especially the stature of Bhaskaran in Sri Lanka should have been more elaborate.\n\nPerformances are great- John deserves lot of credit for taking up the role and doing justice to it.

This film also looks like a propaganda film, while Tamils are being slaughtered by some group, presumably the Sri Lankan forces, there is a child crying in the mayhem wearing a sign stating 'Stop Killing Tamils.' FYI, Tamil activism only started during the late 2000s.\n\nAnother strange thing in the film is that there is a mysterious white guy with an Australian accent, and another with an American accent with no description as to who they are. They supposedly are negotiating with the LTF (LTTE) in the film, while there is a guy looking like BJP Prime Minister candidate Narendra Modi. Very fishy?"

Indians very rarely take films on such subjects since it demands very strong screenplay and often the producers and directors for commercial reasons will dilute the scripts by adding some nonsense. First of all the main credit should go to John Abraham for producing this film and second to Shubhendu Bhattacharya and Somnath Dey for writing an incredibly brilliant screenplay and third to director Soojit Sircar for not tapering with the screenplay.\n\nLoved this film."

        "review_detailed_main": "Madras Cafe is probably one of the most engaging political crime thrillers to come out of Bollywood. While the Khans constantly rape human emotions in any blunder of a flick they become a part of, Madras Cafe scores high with impeccable method acting by John Abraham.\n\nThis is probably the first time John has worked to his true potential. Apart from the exceptional direction and editing, the film's only flaw I find is Nargis Fakhri. True that her role demanded her to be stylish and sophisticated, she is still the odd one out when compared with every other performance in the film. Even the character of \"Ruby\" played by Rashi Khanna scores well over Fakhri's performance in terms of the natural method adopted by the side-actress. Somehow Fakhri's fans will be proud of her because she has consciously stepped out of her mute- model image, and delivered the best she could in a very demanding role.\n\nDirector Shoojit Sircar's claim that the movie is a work of fiction will eventually be claimed to be true, however, I didn't find anything out of place as far as the facts in the movie are concerned. The crew has done its homework thoroughly and have kept the controversies at bay, but then again - shite happens only in India!\n\nFinally, the movie puts John back in the league. The plot is gripping and the climax is the fact with which we Indians have learned to live. Enjoy!\n\nRating: 8/10 (2 points off for Nargis Fakhri's below average performance)"

Story is inspired from the real events and tells a lot about the civil war in Sri Lanka, espionage system of India, arms dealers and their interests in conflict. However, one thing that surprised me was no role of the Sri Lankan government was shown in the movie.\n\nActing wise I think Sidharth Basu was the best, then John. Nargis Fakhri did not have much to do in the film. But, I think it is all the director who should be given credit for such a great movie. After Vicky Donor and Yahan, Shoojit seems to graduating from fine to finer film making.\n\nMy final verdict, it is a must watch who love realistic movies. And, Yes, I liked no song Hindi movie."

It brings to life the Lankan war which many viewers were too young to have known. It highlights India's ambiguous role, moving sensitively, taking no sides. Its second half grows more fraught and taut, conspiracies and compulsions becoming clearer. Madras Cafe deserves an extra half-star for guts, going for the gunpowder - but with a restrained hand. Wonderful film delivered by Shoojit Sircar and John Abraham after 'Vicky Donor'! Note: If you like typical Hindi movie masala, unrealistic action or melodrama, this movie is not for you."

        "review_detailed_main": "Finally, Indian cinema seems to be coming off age! Amidst the formula- based 100+ crore-club 'rabbits', certain 'tortoises' based on biopics and real incidents are getting into the race and winning hearts. The latest turtle on the track is Shoojit Sircar's 'Madras Caf\u00e9'. No, it's not a turtle in pace, but definitely a low-profile creation imbibing a high-profile story, untold till date on silver-screen. Hard to believe, but yes, this one comes from the 'Vicky Donor' director. While Sircar tickled our funny bones weaving a sensitive issue in his last routing, this time he forays into a new zone of political spy thrillers. Here's my take on various facets of the movie:\n\n\u0095 Plot: The movie revolves around origin and development of LTTE (referred to as LTF) movement in Sri Lanka and Indian intervention therein, which eventually led to assassination of Late Rajiv Gandhi (referred to as 'PM/ex-PM' only, his name not mentioned). LTTE issue was dealt in the past by movies like 'Roja' but this one literally dives to the sea-bed in detailing. The subject is very new and was equally sensitive to handle. But full marks to Sircar for doing the job so remarkably well. Movie is well-paced, smartly edited and impact-fully presented. Best part, it does not attempt to be judgmental on the issue and aims at presenting only whats and hows of the events dexterously.\n\n\u0095 Cast: Casting is the biggest forte of Madras Caf\u00e9. A larger than life issue like this demanded sensible casting and Sircar is bang on here too! John Abraham does full justice to the lead-role with his limited acting skills. Nowhere, he overplays or crosses the 'realism' line. However, for me, it's Siddharth Basu (the tele-quiz man of India) who steals the show with his impactful performance as RD Sir. He is suave and composed as demanded by the role. Hope to see more of him in coming days in Bollywood! Nargis Fakhri is good in the limited role she has. Unlike Rockstar, where she was required to emote (and failed miserably), in 'Madras Caf\u00e9', her character had to be stoic and stone- faced and converse only in English; so, the role suited her completely. Model Rashi Khanna adds a bit to the G-quotient as John's wife. All other actors are also perfectly casted, whether be those from Indian squad or LTTE/ Lankan groups (casted mostly from Tamil Film industry).\n\n\u0095 Cinematography: Kamaljeet Negi does a kamaal with his beautiful camera work. We see amazing yet intriguing jungles of Lanka, heart- rending war sorrows, quick spy sequences in Thailand, all through the eyes of his magic lens.\n\n\u0095 Music: We have seen in the past serious subject movies getting unnecessary potholes in the name of unrequired songs. Sircar was intelligent enough to limit music to background only. The sole song on- screen is with the closing credentials, which does not perturb audience's attention.\n\n\u0095 Flaws: The movie suffers from minor hiccups viz.: - Exaggerated emotional outburst by John for the assassinated ex- PM - Substantial use of English and Tamil (though with subtitles) might irk some.\n\nDespite having the spy angle, 'Madras Caf\u00e9' has no frills attached like 'Ek tha tiger' or 'Agent Vinod'. It is sincerely to-the-point till the very end. Hope, it encourages the new-age film-makers in B-town to foray more into such 'real' cinema. The movie is definitely a must-watch for all those expecting meaning and substance."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is a very unfortunate fact that bollywood is still very much behind in making a movie which pumps up your heart, keeps you on the edge of your seat and lastly terrifies you. Yes there are many of them which falls in these categories but very few of them stands out. They start in order to make a thriller but then after bollywood-ising it ultimately comes out as a comedy. Adding characters which the movie don't need and introducing love-songs which don't speak even for themselves let alone the movie to which they are part of, have been the real problems for these movies.\n\nBut, Madras Cafe breaks all these rules and then gives a hard slap to all those filmmakers who are making comedy out of a thriller. It is a high intense drama thriller where the tension is high, characters are there not just for the sake of it, absence of songs are there so as not to spoil the mood(they really were not needed) and finally the story is moving.\n\nMadras Cafe is set against the backdrop of Sri Lankan Civil War in the 1980s and is about the lives of civilian getting destroyed as they hang in the middle of the government and LTF.The main plot revolves around the,as they say, Grand-Conspiracy of the assassination of the Ex Prime Minister of India by many external forces so as to control the economy of the world.\n\nI am still amazed with the fact that Shoojit Sircar who made the light hearted Vicky Donor is the same man behind Madras Cafe. This is what movie making is all about where versatility, which is solely missing in Bollywood nowadays, is what many people look for and Shoojit Sircar seems to have made full use of it.The detailing done by him in the movie is top-notch. The conversion of colorful sequences into a black and white one to show the casualties of the civil war is done exceptionally well. He is the real hero behind the movie and certainly has become one of those directors to watch out for in future.\n\nThe casting of the movie is very well balanced as Nargis speaks English because she is just terrible when she speaks Hindi(Rockstar), John Abraham makes you feel for the character Vikram. It's a milestone in his career. The rest supporting cast does a commendable job. Kamaljeet Negi(DOP) has taken this movie to another level as he has shot the film exceptionally well, the civilians getting killed and the war sequences being the high point. Yes there was only one song which came when the end credits started to roll in the movie but still the background score provided by Shantanu Moitra was excellent and really keeps the tension alive which was certainly needed for a movie of this kind.\n\nMadras Cafe is one of those rare movies where thriller doesn't get converted into a comedy and obviously where second half is better than the first.Finally this film ends giving tribute to Shri Rabindranath Tagore by using his poem 'Where the mind is without fear.......' This film certainly means business."

        "review_detailed_main": "Familiar with European/US movies, I have tried couple of Bollywood productions lately. This one was by far the best. I do realize that I'm biased in taste etc. but since all the 10/10 scores seem to be based on some bias either, I think I'm allowed to give my opinion. It's been my last Bollywood movie. I cannot stand the simplicity in characters, storyline and moral issues. Not even an attempt to scratch the surface of a story to check whether there is something below it. Not an attempt to create a plot which is not a straight line from A to Z and not an attempt to deepen a character towards a level that someone can have more dimensions than just a patriotic hero, a worried wife, a drunk traitor or whatever stereotypes appear."
