Spice World has a plot that's like, thinner than paper thin - and this might sound like I'm giving you a spoiler here, but trust me, I'm not, haha - it's basically that you've got the Spice Girls, and they do some stuff, and it kind of all strings together somehow. But because the girls are so fun to watch, and there are some pretty funny jokes and random humour in it, it manages to keep its head above the water despite having no plot to speak of.\n\nSo y'know, if you want a fun bit of nothing that doesn't make a ton of sense but leaves you feeling kinda good nonetheless, this is a good movie choice."

I know it's a cliche, but this film has a clear idea of its place in the scheme of things, and it knows it's not got a shot of toppling \"Citizen Kane\" from the public's affections, so it just sets out to have fun. Whether the audience will be doing the same is a different matter entirely. If you can stomach random sequences strung together with barely an excuse for a plot, and countless jokes that can most kindly be described as of the 'hit & miss' variety, you should be alright. Hey, if you watch this movie of your own volition and STILL feel you are justified in complaining that it's awful, you deserve everything you get. Myself, I think it's churlish to overly criticise such a harmless piece of fluff that is obviously desperate to be liked. So I won't. It's about as good as could have been reasonably expected. (There I go, damning it with faint praise!)\n\nIncidentally, of the girls, only Victoria shows the ability to at least deliver a line adequately. Having said that, don't expect her to be appearing in a Scorsese movie anytime soon (There I go again... !)\n\nWe'll just ignore the fact that numerous actors belittle their art in various cameo appearances. (Grant, Hoskins & Cumming, I'm looking at you!) Notice I didn't include Roger Moore in that group. I didn't think it appropriate. After all, this is just his level."

I was interested to see those two actors together in a movie again, so I decided to give Spice World a try.\n\nI do not exaggerate when I say Spice World was one of the most horrifying and painful viewing experiences I have ever witnessed, and that's even accounting for the fact that I was able to (thank you Lord) skip through the millions of vacuous musical numbers using my tivo.\n\nI don't think there was a single good performance in this movie, not even by the real actors in it. Meat Loaf and Richard O'Brien are, of course, wasted. Few speaking lines, no musical contributions, really just cameos.\n\nFor those who like bad movies (i.e. enjoy making fun of them MST3K style), this is still NOT a good movie for you. I think that's because the movie is already supposed to be a comedy. For some reason, it's difficult to crack funny jokes at a bad comedy. Maybe that's why MST3K never used comedies in their show. The bad humor cancels out your good humor, somehow.\n\nAnyway, a movie to avoid at all costs. Zero stars."

The only other people in the theater with us were some teeny-boppers dressed up like the Spice Girls and some gangsta wannabes, who were probably hoping that there might be a flash of nudity. By the end of the movie, the wannabes had thrown all their drink ice at the movie screen and were booing it out loud. This is one reason not to watch this movie, even on video at home. There is a chance the ice you throw at the tv screen may somehow harm it, and your booing will wake the neighbors.\n\nThe teeny-boppers were not impressed with everyone else's responses to the film (violent vomiting, painful spasms), but I'm sure they've seen it another 40 times on video, alternating it with viewings of Titanic.\n\nIn short, this is a bad movie. A very, very, very bad movie. If you have read Douglas Adams' \"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\", then think of it this way: it is only slightly better than a Vogon poetry reading.\n\nI wouldn't advise you to see it, but if you do, look out for:\n\n1. The suits the tv guy wears. He's a pretty spiffy dresser.\n\n2. The bus-jumping scene. This was just kitschy enough to *actually* be funny.\n\n3. Roger Moore. Pity him. He was once a Bond."

Every \"drama\" scene drains the movie of any fun shown before. Half way into the film it becomes really bad. Frankly I felt the director said, \"We got their money, who cares what they see next?\" Then the film becomes a cheap montage of lousy sets and action. What is truly sad is that the Spice Girls do have talent and actually interesting personalities. They deserved a good movie to showcase their skills. And this movie dragged them off the stage. I was a fan and I felt exploited and insulted by this worthless film. I hate the Spice Girls because of this film. It bluntly stated, \"We feel our fans are idiots. They'll gladly buy any cheap item we drop in their laps.\" This movie has made me disgusted with the Spice Girls. They obviously care as little for their fans as they did with their careers.

        "review_detailed_main": "Let's just be brutally honest here; this is a Spice Girls vehicle. No doubt about it. From the biggest hater of the film to the biggest fan of the girls, everyone might as well admit from the very beginning: this film was primarily (and, in the opinion of many, purely) made to promote the Spice Girls as well as their then-new album. The moment you realize/accept that fact is the moment that this film gets easier to sit through. However, it still is very, very hard to sit through, and the majority of the people I know wouldn't be able to sit through the entirety of this mess of a film, not even to satisfy the most basic human instincts of curiosity by finding out what happens in the end. The film pretty much plays like a 90-minute promotional video, or a compilation of music videos with pointless plot in-between each performance to keep the music from getting to be too much. Newsflash: the people who would willingly watch this would most likely be just as happy with a 90-minute compilation of music videos or live performances; they don't care about the film itself. I'm not saying that every single Spice Girls fan hated, or even disliked the film itself(I'm not even claiming that one single fan didn't enjoy seeing the girls being \"themselves\"); what I am saying is that they wouldn't have cared if this feature was a 90-minute long music video, instead of the barely coherent mess that the movie is. But, back to the point I was trying to make; the film is a Spice Girls movie. Not a comedy, or a music movie, but a Spice Girls movie. Made entirely for the fans. This, of course, means that the movie is exclusively enjoyable for the fans... and now that the girl-band is no longer a hot subject, and it's no longer \"in\" to like them, their fan-base has been reduced to a minimum. Therefore, now, only seven years after the film was made(or a few years ago, for that matter; ever since they stopped being popular) the film will only appeal to those who are still fans. As you have probably figured out by everything I've written up to this point, I am not, nor have I ever been a fan of the girls. They are charming, sure, their songs are catchy(admit it, even you've hummed along one or two of their singles when it came on the radio), and they are, undeniably, quite attractive, but that's all there is to it... and that's certainly not enough to carry a feature film, once they're no longer famous. Of course, the director probably didn't think about that, and merely made the film to capitalize on their popularity. Oh well. The film now belongs in the same category as one of those films made about some famous guy/girl/group of people that people no longer care about... probably all inspired by The Beatles(unless someone came before them... I'm not sure if they were the first bands to do feature films). The thing is, The Beatles not only were popular back when they made their films, some 30-40 years ago; they still are popular. The Spice Girls aren't. They were merely the newest of the popular teen-bands... and they didn't last much longer than most others. Now, that's enough for the analyzing, on to the review. The plot is barely coherent and poorly paced, constantly throwing new characters into the story, that appear for a few minutes only to disappear again, as well as introducing subplots that are never used to full advantage. The acting is atrocious. The characters are tired stereotypes. The cinematography is forgettable and unimaginative. The humor is British humor at its worst(I think, at least; I haven't seen enough British comedies to determine if there is a lower level than this). All in all, the film have little to offer(apart from one or two clever references and some good self-parodying in one or two places) to anyone but Spice Girls fans. I recommend this exclusively to Spice Girls fans. It's to painful to sit through for virtually anyone else, even if it's just to laugh at the pure stupidity of it. Everyone but Spice Girls fans: Avoid at all costs. 1/10"

Enough so that we occasionally trek to Los Angeles just to be closer to the aura of the entertainment world. I was in London when the Spice Girls went to the top of the charts there, so I witnessed their phenomenon twice.\n\nThat in mind- I must say that \"Spice World\" has got to be, hands down, the worst movie that I have ever seen. The acting is just outright uninspired and lousy. The plot line... well.. let's just say you won't have to think much during this movie.\n\nIt is so bad that we both have recommended it to friends on the premise that you'll never see another movie as bad as it. :) Personally I nominate the birth scene for worst acted scene in the history of the entertainment world.\n\nLooking for similar pictures? Check out \"Cool as Ice\", Vanilla Ice's movie of the same genre. It's actually a little better than this one."

Now I'm going to ruin the whole movie by telling it to you so you don't have to go rent it. Basically the whole story is about George Wendt wanting to make a movie about the Spice Girls. He's sitting there explaining the Plot. They get to a scene when oh my god they're running late for a concert so they hop in their bus and rush along to make it to the show. Of course on their way a draw bridge is going up and they do the same old \"Speed\" scene. The producer they are selling this Idea to says sounds expensive and George Wendt quickly replies \"Doesn't have to be\" and they cut to a picture of a little matchbox replica of the Spice Girls Bus going over a model Drawbridge. Just Hilarious!! But the rest of the movie was horrid jokes were much worse and it was so bad that any other scenes were just a waste of time to even remember. It wasn't even one of those bad movies that you could have a good time watching because it's bad. There is that one scene and that is the only speck of this movie even worth watching."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is FUN. And the sad thing is that most people are too close-minded to see that. The general consensus seems to be: \"It's the Spice Girls in a movie? It's going to be awful!\" and either they never see the movie, or they allow their prejudices to judge the movie for them.\n\nFirstly, let me say that I am not, and was never, a Spice Girls fan. I was way too old for their target market when they were popular, and whilst one or two of their songs had catchy tunes, some were downright annoying. They were a very cleverly manufactured girl band in a time when that market was wide-open. Giving each girl a distinctive character and style was a stroke of genius on the part of their 'creators', and while they didn't have particularly strong voices (except perhaps for Mel C), they didn't have particularly bad ones either. I've heard far worse. So I went into this movie purely out of curiosity, expecting it to be somewhere between awful and merely silly, but I ended up enjoying myself thoroughly. Also, my 65-year-old father loves this movie, and he saw it only having heard vaguely of the Spice Girls, but not knowing their music at all. Yes, Spiceworld is an exploitation movie; BUT it does an excellent job at it! What I loved most was the way it poked fun at itself all the way through. The character of the screenwriter pitching his idea to the girls' manager (brilliantly played by Richard E. Grant) saying \"It's obvious to us that the Spicegirls are movie stars!\", when it's obvious that they're not, and everyone knows it - there's even a scene at the beginning where he says, \"Yes, but can they ACT?\" and his boss responds with, 'Who cares?\", or similar. I loved that. And while the girls CAN'T really act (some are worse than others; I've read that Victoria was the only one who had taken acting lessons before, but I can't say it showed since I thought she was the weakest link), it's obvious that they're having fun with the script, and they don't do too badly at all.\n\nThe script was another great surprise to me; it's full of good lines and funny characters that poke fun at themselves and their stereotypes. An example of this is the great Roger Moore playing the \"Chief\", who is presumably the Big Boss of the Spice Girls. We only ever see him on the phone with Clifford the manager (Richard E. Grant), and every time we do he is stroking, in pure Bond Villain (or Dr Evil) fashion, a small white animal on his lap. But every time you see him he has a different animal; first it's a cat, then a rabbit, a tiny white pig etc. I thought that was such a great way of poking fun at the stereotype of the villain always having a white pet. And then the character himself has these fantastically enigmatic, senseless, but hysterical lines, like: \"When the rabbit of chaos is pursued by the ferret of disorder through the fields of anarchy, it is time to hang your pants on the hook of darkness. Whether they're clean or not.\" and: \"The headless chicken can only know where he's been. He can't see where he's going. Do not be that chicken.\" I love that off-the-wall humour, and this movie is full of it. Of course, some people just don't GET that kind of humour, which is fine by me as long as it doesn't make them slam the film because of it.\n\nOther moments I love, which elevate this film from could-have-been-dodgy to funny, are the casting of Meatloaf as the Spice Girls bus driver, and then having him say lines like: {on fixing the clogged toilets} \"Hey, I love these girls. I'll do anything for them...but I won't do that!\" - which is, of course, a play on Meatloaf's hit song \"Anything for Love\". Also the parody of the stereotypical characters of the girls, which of course were made up for them anyway, like Victoria not knowing what to wear, and Mel C saying \"It must be really hard for you, Victoria, trying to decide whether to wear the little Gucci dress, or the little Gucci dress, or the little Gucci dress\", and Victoria responding \"Exactly!\", or when Victoria falls into the Thames and continues to scream for help once she's been rescued, and yelling \"This dress is dry-clean only!\", or Geri saying \"Calm down, haven't you ever heard of the word 'compromisation'?\" There are scores of these great moments but they really work better in the film than if I wrote them down here. All I'm saying is that this movie is not ever in a million years as bad as everyone makes it out to be. Yes, it's not the greatest, but then most films aren't. It's so much funnier than you'd think, and yes it has its cheesy moments, but sometimes it's SUPPOSED to be cheesy! That's where it's funny. I really don't understand why this film, whose only aim was to be FUN, and in this it succeeded more than admirably in my opinion, is in IMDb's Worst."

        "review_detailed_main": "About half way through Spice World, it dawned on me that it wasn't going to get any better than the level it was maintaining and a nasty thought hit me: \"when people ask me why I actually motivated myself to sit down and watch this all the way through, I am going to have to think of something to say in reply rather than merely shrug and look down at the floor in embarrassment.\" I found myself for the next ten minutes thinking up various excuses I could use as reasons but eventually settled for 'Curiosity'.\n\nYes; when a film is so bad it motivates you to actually think up reasons you're going to have to say to people when they ask you why you watched it, it's struggling. As it was with Thunderbirds, I was curious as to know what the hell it was all about. I was old enough to remember the Spice Girls and old enough to dislike them but distinctly recall this film getting released. Following the break up and now apparent reunification, Spice World as a film doesn't even hold together as a piece of nostalgic nonsense that should be good enough to kill a few hours as we watch global female icons strut around in little costumes and sing silly little songs. Spice World does not even give us the luxury of having a plot; instead it is more of a documentary-come-spoof of not only the band in question but certain generic films of yesteryear. This means it plays out more like Epic Movie than anything else.\n\nSpice World is really just one massive contradiction. It contradicts itself, its characters contradict what they want to be and how they want to be seen as and even the immediate ending contradicts whether or not it is a film within a film. At the time of the Spice Girls, there was very much an atmosphere of the band wanting to take over. The title of this film: 'Spice World' suggests a world full of 'spice'; the video for the song of the same name is set in a dystopian future where everything is exactly that; the 'V' sign the girls use to signify girl power is commonly associated with 'victory', ie; Victory, girl power rules'; there is also the familiar sight of a band cashing in on consumerism and globalisation as they make their presence more known around the world. But rather than Spice World posing as some sort of political/musical version of Battleship Potemkin; its scenes play out more like a retread of films that we've already seen. Roger Moore was James Bond and he spoofs the Bond villain persona; Richard E. Grant sits and listens to film pitches al\u00e1 The Player and the final incident involving a bomb blowing up not only means the film is confused as to whether its fiction or not but whether or not it thinks the fourth wall is reparable once it has been broken.\n\nThe worst example of contradictory content in the film comes very early on when the girls are sitting in a bus, that looks more like an actual room than anything else, discussing how they hate being seen as the 'baby'; the 'posh one' the 'scary one', etc. Fine you think, maybe they are getting sick of that but what follows is an immediate counteraction to their complaint in the form of a montage showing each of the girls dressed as Wonder Woman, Marilyn Monroe and then of each other. The girls go from wearing their clothes, acting dumb and stating that \"there's more to us than just our persona tags\" to..........wearing even more clothes and costumes and acting in an even dumber manner. You can imagine the thought process: so Ginger Spice doesn't like to be called Ginger Spice anymore; \"Ok, I know; I'll dress up like Wonder Woman and crack a whip.\" Yes, I can see there's so much more to you than your generic tags. The other glaring example of contradiction in this film that the girls fall foul of comes in the form of their allegiances. Nearer the beginning of the film rather than the middle, the girls talk about how important their fans are to them; this idea returns to haunt them since the actual final third revolves around a dilemma the girls face: stay with a friend as they give birth and shun fans waiting at the gig or vice-versa. There should be no argument: they've established their fans come first but what happens is they counter balance their priorities by staying in the hospital with their pregnant friend.\n\nSpice World is a film that does absolutely no favours for anyone and that includes the girls themselves. The Spice Girls come across as plastic, one-dimensional and rather stupid; frequently getting their priorities, beliefs and ideas mixed up with one another; never giving us the impression these are smart and good people making smart and good music. The film's portrayal of Italians and homosexuals is disappointing as is the incompetent film crew consisting of a black man and a fat person; the way the bad guy is a fat, spitting Australian bent on magazine sales who has an English assistant is horrible; the film's narrative wants us to believe that stuff being printed in the newspapers by a man who gets the scoops in an impossible manner is entertaining and realistic but it's just silly. There just isn't enough space to cover all the things horribly wrong with this film but I am surprised this didn't destroy the Spice Girls when it first came out. Cheap laughs; a nasty narrative; horrible archetypes and so many times in which the focus band of the title come across as incompetent is enough to label this trash, 'trash'."

Note: From now on listen to the critics - they know what they're talking about.\n\nThis film is an embarassment. The girls can't act. Not one of them seems comfortable in front of the camera. Baby Spice - stop sucking those lollipops, it's not cute, it's retarded. Sporty Spice - her voice is like a constant drilling in my ears. Ginger Spice - I'm so glad she left the group. Posh Spice - my goldfish has a better personality. Scary Spice - well, she was the best of a bad bunch.\n\nRichard E.Grant seems to be as embarassed as I was while starring in the film. The cameos from famous faces are only successful when they don't have to be on the screen with the Spicegirls. Roger Moore is quite funny and Bob Hoskins doesn't shame himself.\n\nI don't know what genre you'd put this in. It can't be classified as a comedy because it's not funny. It can't be classified as a musical because these girls can't sing. I think the only genre fitting is a disaster movie - this is a natural disaster!"

Here they seemed to believe their own bulls**t. e.g \"We're big pop stars now, we can do anything. Acting, no problem\" While they trained to sing and dance, they are clueless as actors. To be fair half of the blame lies with a script that appears to have undergone no re-writing and a TV director who has no feel for the big screen. Much of the locations are way too bland for what was then the world's hottest pop act. In fairness it was probably rushed because they had a tour/ album lined up. What should have been a laugh was one of the most excruciating 90 minutes I have spent at the cinema."

        "review_detailed_main": "I remember during the Spice Girls' heyday in the late 90's, I despised them for a while. When I think back, I don't know exactly why I did, but I was only eleven/twelve years old at the time, so I've obviously changed a bit since then. Right now, I'm basically indifferent to the group, so I don't have any strong feelings about their reunion. Anyway, I obviously wouldn't have even thought of watching this movie back in the day, but a decade after it first came out, I have finally watched it, and have learned that I wasn't missing much.\n\nThe film shows the Spice Girls (Melanie B, Melanie C, Emma, Victoria, and Geri) as they travel around in England on their double-decker bus, meeting lots of people, and sometimes having fun, but also experiencing all sorts of trouble. Meanwhile, a newspaper editor named Kevin McMaxford, who hates the Spice Girls, is spreading rumours about them to try and ruin their reputation, and a film director named Piers Cuthbertson-Smyth keeps coming up with silly movie ideas for the band. The five pop stars have a gig coming up in a few days at the Royal Albert Hall in London, but as it draws near, a lot gets in their way!\n\nSome love the Spice Girls and some hate them, but regardless of that, as a film, \"Spice World\" is a very poor effort. The story isn't very well-written, carelessly slopped together, and it seems a lot of things were just thrown in, such as the group meeting extraterrestrial fans. The film often seems rushed, jumping from one scene to another too quickly. The script, which was clearly just slopped together as well, is very poor, with both the band members and other characters blurting out lines which are supposed to be funny, but are just ridiculous! Almost all the gags in the film (yes, this is a comedy) are lame. I never laughed, and none of the gags ever gave me a full smile. Lastly, the ending of the film is a tad abrupt.\n\nNow, if I were a big Spice Girls fan, I'm sure that would have helped a bit, as a good number of their songs are featured in this film, whether in full or in part, but I still certainly wouldn't have cared for much else in the film. I think I've made it clear that regardless of the music, this is one unfocused mess of a film! It was probably meant for the group's preteen fans mainly. I remember a lot of them, the majority of them girls, but there were definitely quite a few boys as well, and I'm sure most of these fans liked it. However, the movie really doesn't have a lot for most people, apart from the songs for fans, and sadly, that is not enough to make up for the extremely poor quality of \"Spice World\"."

The story is simply empty other than these bunch of skimpy dressed girls fooling around all over London and a brief encounter of some kind of aliens. Some cameos, mostly British stars doesn't do much to enrich this move. Overall this move is inoffensive, almost harmless, but very very low on entertainment.

It was written by their managers wife! And has too many more than subtle references about Britain. The acting is cheesy but no way did it tarnish any of the many important actors/comedians/singers who cameo'd in this film because as I remember Richard E. Grant saying it was just so great to be part of the experience, it really was a time-line in history.

        "review_detailed_main": "In the 1990's, the Spice Girls were the reigning queens of pop, selling countless amounts of records across the world. An unprecedented marketing blitz followed, culminating in the film \"Spice World.\" Backlash was inevitable, and many were ready to dismiss the film or praise the film solely based on their dislike or enjoyment of the Spice Girls' music. When reviewed as a film in its own right, \"Spice World\" is a very entertaining movie with its tongue always firmly in its meta-textual cheek.\n\nThe Spice Girls -- Geri Halliwell (Ginger), Melanie Brown (Scary), Emma Bunton (Baby), Melanie Chisholm (Sporty), and Victoria Adams (Posh, now Victoria Beckham) -- play themselves. The Girls are getting ready for their first live concert in Royal Albert Hall, but their preparation is beset with several obstacles, including the overdue pregnancy of the Girls' best friend (\"AbFab\"'s Naoko Mori) and a vicious tabloid editor (Barry Humphries) that wants to see them ruined so he can the ensuing headlines will sell millions of papers. A host of supporting characters add to the mix, including the Girls' high-strung manager (Richard Grant), an insidious paparazzo (Richard O'Brien), a clueless documentary film-maker (Alan Cumming), and a Hollywood producer/screenwriter duo (George Wendt/Mark McKinney) relentless pitching ideas to the Girls' manager for movie spin-offs.\n\nThe Girls do play themselves to a point, but they are more accurately playing themselves as the public sees them. Sporty is always on an exercise bike, for instance, and Baby is never without a lollipop or stuffed animal. They live up to their stereotypes and play them to the ultimate hilt. The Girls themselves seem relaxed, with the most confident performance coming from Geri, who seems quite natural on the screen. Mel B and Emma both seem almost as relaxed, but Mel C seems like she needs a little more coaching on screen presence. Victoria, unfortunately, looks quite uncomfortable whenever the camera focuses on her, and in some scenes she actually comes off as resentful that she had to star in this film.\n\nThe director, Bob Spiers, is best known perhaps for his work on the series \"Absolutely Fabulous\", and he brings the same comic hand to this film has he did to that supremely funny show. The comedy is played light, never too much over-the-top, although a good deal of silliness is inserted. Dramatic moments are often muted by a small joke or bit of campy melodrama. Nothing is ever taken too seriously, and the film clips along at a good pace, peppered with hilarious fantasy sequences, knowing self-parody, and satirical jabs at everything from hospital drama to action movie car chases.\n\nThe film is full of cameos as well, including both musicians and non-musicians. Elvis Costello turns up as a bartender, while Meatloaf plays the driver of the Spice Bus (a double-decker bus emblazoned with SPICE on its roof). Jennifer Saunders shows up as a bitchy fashionista, while Bob Hoskins' role is too funny to give away here.\n\nIt's easy to see why some people dislike the film, however. The soundtrack tries to fit as many Spice Girls songs as possible into the film, which is to be expected, but the songs themselves are of a wildly varying quality, from the rousing \"Spice Up Your Life\" to the questionable \"Viva Forever.\" It's also hard to buy the Girls' backstory as struggling musicians, and the film lacks any kind of dramatic tension, which may be intentional, but it gives the film a fluffy quality that does not appeal to everybody. Some moments in the film now seem oddly indicative of future events: about a year of the release, Geri would leave the group and the Girls' next album without her would signal the end of the act, with all the Girls going on to solo careers of amazingly diverse success (Geri and Mel C have score the best, while nobody wants to hear Victoria's album, ever). Keep this in mind during the fantasy sequence with Stephen Fry as a square judge.\n\nAll in all, \"Spice World\" is a very entertaining diversion. It's a pop song in film format: it's airy, fun, and slightly mindless, but for a while you forget about your worries. Certainly not as bad as people have made it out to be, but one to avoid if you really just don't like the Spice Girls. 7 out of 10."

The acting was not just bad, it was so bad it made their singing ability look good... and they were playing themselves! Really, how hard can that be? Don't get me wrong, I'm aware it was suppose to be silly and not taken seriously, but I'm pretty sure it was also suppose to be entertaining... which it wasn't.

Besides, this film made me forget what I liked about the spice girls in the first place. After watching this film, I went from a secret fan, to seeing the spice girls as the people that got me to spend my time and money on the worst film ever made."

Recently, I raided my cousins movie collection to find something to borrow, and when I saw Spice World, I thought, why not? It would be fun taking a trip down memory lane. Now that I have seen it again, I'm not entirely sure how I ever managed to watch the entire thing. It's quite possibly one of the worse movies I've ever seen. The plot was crap, the acting was crap, the best thing about it was the music (which isn't even that great itself) and if I wanted to hear SG music, I'd buy a CD. Believe me, you wouldn't want to waste your time or your money on this low budget,mediocre film. I've seen it, and now I can't help but wonder exactly how many hours I spent watching this movie throughout my life, that I'll never get back."

You've probably had the chance to read at least 100 of my commentaries on all kinds of movies on this site, so what difference does SPICE WORLD make as long as a forgettably single viewing is just fine. I won't say that is a pretty lousy timekiller. It just isn't worth the appeal, even with five singing Barbie dolls who can dress. The movie is a lot of kidding around, but it actually has its heart in the right place in satirizing movie references and showing off its \"Girl Power\". There! You've got the formula, but you've got it all worn thin after (yup!) one single viewing, not 700!\n\nBut wait! A star-studded cast isn't complete without the delightful likes of Posh, Baby, Sporty, Scary, and Ginger (one of which is gone in reality), and they're getting an extra fifteen minutes of fame selling movie tickets. We'll see in the near future if they can start taking advantage of their acting more seriously. Paul, Ringo, John, and George can do MUCH better! Not only does this rip off The Beatles, but it wasn't even intended to! As you easily know, this movie was put out within a year following the Spice Girls' rapid rise to fame and fortune, and so you have here a rush job in the making. It all goes to show why promoting big name franchises pays off in these high-tech days, without a whole lot of \"movie\" to back it up (Are you paying attention, Sony?).\n\nSooner or later, you're gonna find SPICE WORLD sitting right next to those New Kids On The Block tapes in the thrift stores, and even the GARBAGE PAIL KIDS MOVIE on the dusty shelves of hidden stockrooms. I must call upon any current Spice Girls fan who loved this movie to hang on to what you got. Just like The Beatles proved, the next thirty years will compare to a glass of wine. History is sweet, right? For me and other anti-fans of Top 40 pop music, this movie simply doesn't cut it."

You people who didn't like the movie are expecting LORD OF THE RINGS or something, and this will never reach that level. But for a fun, energetic, insane romp with countless nods to classic movies, stars, and actors, this is perfect.\n\nThe Spice Girls had their time in the limelight and used it to produce essentially a theatrically-released extended music video. If you're old enough to remember M-TV when it was actually JUST a music video channel, this is what SPICEWORLD is (think of the classic Michael Jackson video/movies like THRILLER where it was music and a bit of story tossed in for good measure). Nope, not Oscar\u0099 material by a long shot, but still quite enjoyable.\n\nOh yes... one last thing: I saw this movie on PPV in 1998 and immediately fell in love with it and the Spice Girls. I was 28 then, and even though I'm 36 now, I still enjoy this movie for what it is. Perhaps that's because I'm OLD ENOUGH to know what it ISN'T."

Just a teensy bit?\n\nTrust me, the British know film, and they know what they're doing with this one. Instead of showing one \"real\" side of the spice girls, they've shoved 50 years of stereotypical rubbish into one movie. You've got people trying to make a movie, a documentary, and the tabloids trying to break the girls apart, along with aliens, hot Italian models and random deja vus. All in one.

Spice Girls as actresses: not quite. It's extremely cheesy and the acting is very subpar, but the likeability of Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton & Co. at least keeps it watchable; to me, anyway.\n\nRichard E. Grant commits to his role, while they also got James Bond himself, Roger Moore, involved. There are also a number of cameos. Their music is entwined well, I wouldn't class myself as a fan but I rate a fair amount of their songs.\n\nI can understand if you dislike this, I truly can, but I found it alright to be honest.

The film goes around with several subplots, one more forgettable than the other. But throughout we do see Spice Girls interacting (and overacting). When you are a child fan, that is how you imagine they must spend some of their free time, or at least, you fantasize about it in a similar fashion.

        "review_detailed_main": "Anyone who grew up during a certain timeframe can't have not come across the Spice Girls to some degree in the late 90s. Actively listening to their music, or watching their movie, well, that's another matter. Even if one enjoys a genre generally, movies emphasizing music are a separate issue, elevating ham-handedness to another level that one must specifically prepare themselves for. Then there are the broader questions of whether those known for their music can also act, of whether the comedy will land, of the quality of the story - and how much English flavor will be lent to a feature about an English musical group that has international appeal. Suffice to say that there were already a lot of factors hanging over this film before it even entered production. Let's not beat around the bush: this is possibly worth watching as a matter of curiosity, or for those who are huge fans of someone involved. Yet if you're looking for earnest entertainment value in any capacity, 'Spice World' is almost certainly not the picture for you.\n\nI genuinely appreciate the work of the hair and makeup artists, and the costume designer. The production design and art direction are swell. The filming locations are splendid, and it's a small joy to see what roles were whipped up to provide cheeky cameos for a wide array of actors, musicians, and otherwise celebrities. (Having the most fun themselves, and likewise probably bringing the most to the movie, are Richard O'Brien and Roger Moore, among others.) Even speaking as someone who never paid particular attention to the Spice Girls when they were the talk of the town, I'd be lying if I said I didn't like (at least some of) the music, and the dance choreography. Furthermore, to the credit of writer Kim Fuller above all, I can honestly say there's some real humor here. There's some fine wit in the dialogue and scene writing, even at its most ridiculous, and some facets of parody and referential comedy, too. Some of the exaggerated characterizations are entertaining in and of themselves; more infrequently, some sight gags or physical comedy come off pretty well, too. Whatever else is true of this picture, I had a good time watching in at least some measure.\n\nThat's the good news. There's also a lot of bad news, however, foremost of which is that the plot is astoundingly thin - yes, there is an actual plot on hand. But it's effectively the very literal least that could possibly be penned to provide an excuse for stringing together the various scenes and ideas, and it's managed so weakly that one could be forgiven for supposing that it was the last thing Fuller put in his screenplay. Furthermore, far removed from the cleverness that 'Spice World' can claim at one time or another, too much of the would-be comedy boils down to \"Haha! Isn't this so silly?!\" I know conventional wisdom says that puns are the lowest form of comedy, but the folks who hold to that ethos have clearly never watched a picture that wanted them to laugh just for the mere fact that someone or something is behaving in an abnormal manner. I thought Seth MacFarlane went low with the common tactic of 'Family Guy' of wanting us to get our chuckles from \"Look! A thing you recognize! Isn't this great?!\"; sadly, the approach here is worse. And that dovetails into one more crucial criticism, which is that too much of the amusement this film would seek to provide is pretty much a precursor to MacFarlane after all: the mere presence of the Spice Girls, partaking in whatever the script and director Bob Spiers are requiring of them, is supposed to be Enough. Well, sorry to disappoint, friends, but except for the most diehard Spice fans at the absolute zenith of their popularity, that tack is nowhere near enough.\n\nI don't think this is so bad as to deserve the full ire it has gotten in the past twenty-five years. Despite what the Stinkers Awards have to say, I don't think this is anywhere close to deserving to be counted among the \"100 worst movies of the twentieth century\"; I've seen too many other features that were far worse. It's worth repeating that I did get some honest laughs out of this; there's some real fun to be had. 'Spice world' does have some measurable intelligence behind its craft. It's just regrettable that there's not more, for too many of these ninety minutes rely on the cheapest of all possible gags, and apply the least of all effort to entertain. With a bit more care, this could have been more meaningfully enjoyable; instead, it's noteworthy and memorable for all the wrong reasons. Indeed, again: unless you're one of those Spice Girls diehards, I don't know how much need there is to see this, save for the direly curious. Yes, you could do much worse, but at the same time, with so many other flicks you could be watching, why spend time with this one?"

I would say it's almost for kids, but it's full of references and humor that kids (and maybe non-Brits) wouldn't get. Also loaded with mostly British celebrities, many of whom were past their prime even when this was released. I'm not sure many fans of the Spice Girls at the time were also fans of Meat Loaf, Richard O'Brien, or Bob Hoskins. But I could be wrong. Anyhow, there were several dumb jokes that made me chuckle, so I can't be too harsh on it."

If you like the spice girls and all their songs it's good for that. but as for a decent believable storyline; it's rubbish. So, if you're a nostalgic 14-19 year old who grew up in the spice girls era and you feel like reminiscing about old times, rent it out or buy it cheap from a charity shop.

The film is actually surprisingly funny. Very well written, the witty lines totally surprised me (didn't expect them to have the collective grey matter to pull it off...) A classic case of a good comedy being put together by having a good team behind them. Lots of fun poked at themselves, which is what makes it, I think, very funny indeed - the girls aren't afraid to completely take the p**s out of themselves. (or they weren't afraid, in those days - the progression of Victoria \"Posh\" Beckham into pop culture paranoia makes you wonder if they'd do it as well now) All up, take it for what it is - a cheesy flick about a pop band phenomenon. Quite funny, but never likely to break any major ground!"

The music (while not the greatest) is infectious pop, the laughs are good, and the acting is good (not necessarily referring to the Spice Girls themselves, but the supporting roles). Although the Spice Girls do a bang-up job at portraying themselves as shown through the media and their so-called personas.

For example, how many people, at any point in time, actually enjoyed watching one of their movies? I prefer to stay out of the 'popular' music of today, for I find it extremely lacking. The Spice Girls also stand more for 'girl power,' whereas today's singers won't have anything to do with it if it doesn't deal with ultimate dependence on a guy. I'll say it again, I love this movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "I was stunned to find the panning this film got. Okay, it's not high art, but it's a good laugh, surely?\n\nOne thing removed from this film in just two years is the veneer of satire. Released in England at a time when the media had begun a predictable backlash and the Spice Girls were about to jettison their manager, this tale of dictating management and not-that-subtle Robert Maxwell spoofs was vaguely on the money. Now that such things are behind the group, and they are indeed back in media favour (for marriages and babies more than the music, and without Geri) this edge is stripped from the film.\n\nSo, what are we left with? Well, the girls aren't about to threaten the Academy Awards, though \"Baby Spice\", who had acted professionally before the group, is noticeably stronger than the rest. Characterisation is strictly one-dimensional, with the constant \"Gucci dress\" fixations of Victoria and crowbarred-in football associations of \"Sporty\" the most irritating element. Suprisingly, the loudest member, Mel G, has the least material foisted on her, and takes the minor role in all the amateurish vignettes. Baby is allowed to smile cutely, and Geri is the brunt of a cavalcade of bra jokes. But this isn't so bad, surely? To spend 90 minutes in the company of five pretty girls, well, four pretty girls, three, well, two, surely, isn't so hard.\n\nUnfortunately, the lack of on-screen presence the girls generate means that they have to be supported by a wide variety of actors, and even other pop stars that achieve a greater presence in momentary cameos (look out for the great scene with Elvis Costello, forced to work as a barman now times are hard). George Wendt, Richard O'Brien, Barry Humphries and even Meatloaf add an air of interest to proceedings, meaning that when the camera switches back to the stars it does tend to sag.\n\nWhen the girls do start to get interesting is when they're performing their songs. Though as most of their songs are remixed or rejigged snippets, this would surely fail to attract the teeny-tot audience at which the film is primarily aimed. As I've said, there are moments of attempted satire, though these are less well-aimed barbs than poorly-aimed damp squibs.\n\nYet still I contend: songs, girls, Roger Moore sending himself up rotten and Richard E.Grant overacting enormously. Not a classic, certainly, but surely good for a throwaway laugh?"

The Spice Girls did what even Britney Spears couldn't do -- make a movie that proves to be irreverent and mocking enough to win over the hearts of any willing skeptic.\n\nMemo to Victoria Beckham/Posh Spice: Please spare us any future records and take a break from fashion -- you missed your calling as a comic actress."

If you are a fan of the Spice Girls and are feeling nostalgic, this is a great movie to have a good laugh. Like I said, it isn't an award winner by any meanings, but it does what a movie should: entertain you."

The odd comical points throughout are clear, precise and witty. The scriptwriter must be very proud of himself/herself...(I'm not sexist)\n\nThis isn't coming from a person who's never been outside and happened to watch only the spice girls movie, but I feel that I have a great and accurate movie judgement.\n\nI feel that the spice girls movie is seriously better than \"The Godfather\""

Spice World wasn't intended to be a documentary, or a social commentary... just a bit of a laugh in the middle of a storm of pop culture!\n\nSo I'm standing up against the cynicism expected for my age group, the jaded, thrust into the world college students and beyond, and shouting to the world that I'm okay, you're ok, and Spice World is okay!

It's not that it was awful or anything, but it's not one of my top ten! The Spice girls should stick to singing, but not in the movies!! They sounded absolutely awful, and I got really sick of hearing all of the same songs that I've been hearing for the past few years. They had only 1 unreleased song in that whole movie!! The opening credits had the theater in hysterics though, it was soooo cheesy!! I don't know why George Wendt, Mark McKinney and so many others were in this, they really didn't have any real purpose in the movie, the producers probably could have saved a little bit of money and hired some absolute no-namers to play the exact same parts!! And the whole Alien scene. Come on now, that was way too dumb, even for my cheesy self. The last fifteen minutes was the most entertaining. The main thing this movie does prove, is that the Spice Girls are easy on the eyes, and that they have GREAT shoes!! I'd say that if you are over 15, you should steer clear of this movie, unless you're a Spice fan, and you are REALLY inebriated!! although I did give it a 10/10. Cuz I was Really inebriated when I watched it!!"

(\"Talented\"? OK, three out of four ain't bad.) To appreciate the movie, one must see the movie for what it is, a satire! The movie was described as a \"mockumentary\" because it basically made fun of everything within reach and some things that were out of reach, like the extraterrestrials who traveled across the galaxies to get autographs from the Spice Girls! C'mon, lighten up! This movie was never meant to inspire or stimulate the intellect. It was made strictly for laughs. The Spice Girls even made fun of themselves. Anything is fair game! The first time I saw \"Spice World\" was in 1998 when I took my daughter, then 10, to the movies. Although she enjoyed it (she was big on the Spice Girls at that time), for me it was sheer torture and an insult to my intelligence. I wanted to cover my face and hope that nobody saw me. I felt that the movie was an excellent example of intellectual manslaughter! If this wasn't bad enough, when the movie was released on video, my daughter wanted the video as well. So we got to see the movie in the privacy of our home. Oh boy! But seeing the movie in the spirit that it was made in, was a totally different experience. It was actually entertaining in a corny way! It definitely qualifies as a candidate for the Golden Turkey Award because it is so bad that it's good! The great and talented Sir Roger Moore obviously read the script before he agreed to contribute his talents to this movie. So it is obviously that he saw the movie for what it was meant to be, a satire, or as they put it it, a mockumentary.\n\nThe movie was loosely based on the Beatles' HARD DAY'S NIGHT. (OK, before you Beatles fans go into a frenzy over that remark, let me explain and redeem myself!) The movie is about a wildly popular group as they tour the country. In 1964, the Beatles traveled by train. In 1997, the Spice Girls traveled by their ridiculously luxurious bus. The scene around the bus should serve as a tip off that this movie is not meant to be taken seriously! Both movies involved a villain who hated the main attraction of the movie.\n\nSo unless you are an \"old teenager\" with fond memories of the \"good old days\" (the 1990s), you may want to lock the door, put on a set of head phones (or turn the volume down low so nobody can hear what you are trying to watch) before putting this movie on.\n\nThen, just lighten up and try not to take everything so damned seriously. You may actually find yourself enjoying this awful movie!"

If the movie was a huge sign of girl power, since they say it over and over and over again, then i get the point that girl power is high shoes and short skirts and pure garbage. i give them the credit for their singing, i like their singing. but the acting really must go somewhere far far away, and thank the lord another movie wasnt made. they should have done a live concert and then made into a dvd special collectors item, and thrown in some free stickers. that could have made more money than that movie ever couldve made with the sales of owning it and seeing it in the cinema. if you were ever a spice girl crazed fan, who felt the need to view every item of girl power produced, trust me when i say that you are NOT missing anything if you never saw this.

There are many many memorable moments from this film that every time it comes up in conversation people will always quote. One being the 'bus going over the bridge' scene and instead of having the stunt proceed a clay model is used.\n\nThe script is very funny and will get a laugh from even the most skeptical. With the soundtrack all Spice Girl songs be sure to bop along with the familiar beats.\n\nAll in all i would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to have a good time and remember back in the days when you were Sporty Spice and life didn't really have that many dramas."

We have all the key elements - five girls who have assigned 'characters' which are not how they see themselves, a megalomaniac manager who will stop at nothing to get the girls to perform, the tabloid editor who reviles the media monster he has created.\n\nThere is no plot to speak of - the girls are heading to the Royal Albert Hall for their first gig - and , erm, that's it. Along the way they have some adventures, with both the actors and the girls sending themselves up outrageously.\n\nParticularly funny is Richard E Grant as the manager and Roger Moore's one liners - 'when the speeding melon hits the wall etc' are priceless.\n\nUltimately, SpiceWorld is a fun piece of non threatening fluff that will make you smile.

In fact, the Spice Girls vehicle is even enjoyable as shallow, but not so dumb entertainment, with a good camp quotient. The self deprecating humor is a good surprise, and the girls seemed to know where they were going - that is, nowhere fast as a \"band\" or musical talents. And the cameos are sometimes really hysterical - I dare you not to laugh at Sir Bob Geldof after his makeover.

Well, Alan's role was not worthy of his enormous talent, but shockingly I found this movie, as a whole, entertaining. I was even more shocked to find that a couple of the girls actually had some talent (I won't name names to protect the worshipers) I've never paid attention to the Spice Girls -- their music is okay, but not something I would buy. There were some really lame parts to the movie (the flashes to the future, the whole baby thing, etc.), but overall it was somewhat amusing. It's too bad that it was all fabricated -- they should have taken a Madonna \"Truth or Dare\" approach -- maybe then the critics would have been more kind. However, I liked the cameo performances by Elton John, Bob Hoskins, etc. and I loved the takes on other movies and songs (e.g. Spice Girl Five aka Tarantino's Fox Force Five in Pulp Fiction, etc. and Meatloaf's line about \"I won't do that\"). Anyway, I don't know who to recommend this movie to. After seeing the movie, those who hate them will only hate them more, and those who love them continue to do so. Perhaps people, as myself, who are ambivalent about the Spice Girls could like this movie."

Years later, here I am cleaning out my old Disney and Barney videos and stumble across my old friend that I used to watch everyday. Even at my old age of fifteen, never failed to crack me up.\n\nObviously, this isn't meant to be a contender for Oscars. Anyone can see that. But I can't find much to hate about a movie that's practically the visual to go along with the song \"Girls just wanna have fun.\" That's all it is, fun. And a lot of good fun at that. It's just a guilty pleasure, and it's so much fun to watch it with old friends singing into hair brushes and wearing feather boas. You just need to keep in mind that it was publicity for their new record and it's not meant to be one of those heavy movies you over-analyse. Recommendation: This movie is much funner when you watch it jumping up and down on a couch like a seven year old.\n\nIS THIS NOT THE BEST FILM EVER??!?!?!"

Every movie needs a good alien scene. Not to mention one with guys' asses showing through the cut outs in shiny purple jumpsuits. The only ridiculously unbelievable part of this movie is the bad guy, who wants to see the demise of the Spice Girls. The notion that anyone could dislike these five music geniuses is heinous.

I think the girls should love the Spice Girls because they're Feminist , and that's a really good and important thing. My favorite is Emma Bunton , i think she's so sexy and in the other hand she's so sweet. I also really like Geri Halliwell , i like her personality and i think she have had a hard life , she deserves to have a good life. I hope the Spice Girls come back together for a 10th year reunion.Does anybodye knows how can i contact the Spice Girls??? If anybody knows please contact me at gio_9391@hotmail.com Thanks Giovannixxx"

Recently I came across a copy and gave it a second viewing, and found it a great laugh and a very pleasurable way to spend eighty-odd minutes. In a time when so many people in the entertainment business take themselves so seriously it is great to watch the five girls make fun of themselves, they knew their acting ability was minimal, except perhaps for Geri, who may have a future in this field. The plot works on several levels, on one hand it can be seen as pure slapstick but also their are more serious threads running through it, such as press intrusion, media distortion of offhand comments (such as Geri's remark about the pope) and the girl's dilemma of balancing their responsibilities between their management and loyalty to a friend (Nicola). This film came out at a time when you couldn't watch TV or open a paper without seeing articles about the Spice Girls, I think many people were put off the girls by this and hence the negative reaction to the film initially. If you can watch this with an open mind just sit back and allow your self to have a laugh at the comedy, enjoy the music and perhaps take on board some of the serious questions the film poses."

I was so excited about the movie coming out, i cant remember my initial thoughts on it but i have always thought it was a funny movie. I think the plot was good although parts i didn't get such as the guy who wants to make a movie of the spice girls and the creepy photographer. Overall the film gives off a feel good image and a let your hair down one. The spice girls different personalities make it good viewing too. I think at times the movie tried to be too serious forgetting the fact that some of the story lines were a bit too silly and that the spice girls aren't professional actors. However the funnier and less strained scenes were brilliant such as the bits at the old house and the photo-shoot. Now being nearly 18 i am well out of the movies original target audience, although i was when it was released! So now being older i can pick up on things that are not good but that doesn't take away my initial love of the movie. Also people seem to be dissing the spice girls on here, for them i will say this they were and still are one of if not the biggest girl band of all time, their songs are catchy and original and they were a strong young women who made valuable contributions to music!!!"

It's strength lies in the self-parody - not only of the Spice Girls themselves but also some of the other cameo guest appearances [...some of which probably won't be appreciated by a non-UK audience].\n\nProbably best watched (as I did!) with a cinema full of kids during the peak of the Spice Girls craze. Now that bubble has burst much of the appeal (& humour) has died with it. Still, it was FUN while it lasted."

Now to waste time... Victoria Beckham's fat in this movie. Melanie C isn't all dykie. Geri Halliwell comes off as a know it all b!tch. Emma Bunton and Melanie Brown kinda play backseat in this."

Definitely not to be taken seriously (some people act like they were expecting Shakespeare here), it's a funny, charming, witty and light hearted romp through a week or so in the life of the Spice Girls. Of course, the girls play stereotyped versions of themselves - Mel C is always exercising, while Baby is constantly sucking lollipops and Posh obsesses over which black Gucci dress to wear.\n\nThe girls aren't bad actors; they seem quite natural, which is probably not as easy as it sounds when making a film. The plot is quite simple, but the twists and turns it takes (eg the screen writers explaining their premise to Richard E Grant becomes a narrative of the girls actually doing the crazy things that so far have only been committed to paper) make it a wild ride.\n\nMy favorite part of the film is the incredible special effect of the double decker Spice bus leaping over an open drawbridge. The build up to this scene was perfectly tense, and the climax of the scene was brilliantly conceived and executed. I've seen this film many times over the last few years. Andjust so you know, I'm a 32 year old, straight Australian male."

Their kind of like Hanson though you could love a band so much and then they kind of leave the seen or you grow up and think your too old for them, well I do not think I ever grew out of them or got mad when they left the seen. When their CD Forever came out I know i bought it the first day it came out and this movie makes me laugh even after so many years.

They were my superstars that I hung posters up on my room. They were the girls I looked for inspiration, this ladies who were my idols at the tender age of seven. While watching this movie I got excited and loved singing to the songs with all my best friends. So what if it isn't a award winning performance? I will find this \"ancient\" movie in my attic one day thinking back to the 90s, and I will blow the dust off of the paper cover protecting the video cassette. What good memories it brings back.\n\nIf you were young at the time and loved the Spice Girls, then by all means watch it for those memories. If you were never a fan or never knew about them, don't watch it. I guess it's just a movie for us who have been fans screaming on the couch when we were in grade one."

Just as I will never love the movie Purple Rain as much as my mother did due to her generation's love for Prince, not many will love Spice World the way Spice Girls fans do.\n\nThe Spice Girls were positive role models in the 90's for girls like me. Scary Spice inspired me to love my huge curly hair. Sporty Spice inspired me to embrace my inner tom-boy. Their songs were catchy and widely popular for a while. Their movie venture may not have been as successful as their songs. However, it was not a total flop. Spice World had a wacky but interesting story line and a few compelling sub-story lines. This will always be considered one of my favorite movies"

I was amazed at how art house it was \u2013 with throw backs to the old Beatles movie genre and other madcap '70's and 80's productions (Thunderbirds, the Monkees, etc). Apart from the catchy music and the generally enjoyable overacting \u2013 the all star cast makes it a genuine 'spot the actor' vehicle. (For example: this from http://filmbabble. blogspot.com/2007/06/20 -great-modern-movie-cameos.html : \"Elvis Costello as a bartender and credited as 'Himself' Costello plays a nice tongue-in-cheek note as the Girls talk about their possible flash-in-the-pan prospects\".) It spoofs everything about those bad movies we loved to watch \u2013 model buses jumping over model bridges, E.T. (the Movie) in 'bad green coats', the Magical Mystery Tour amazing bus, media moguls (Rupert Murdoch anyone?), Hollywood 'run and go' action movies, over-sexed Italian dancers etc. The more I watched the more I saw. I drove my daughter crazy pointing out ... 'hey that is a takeoff from ...'. If you are studying cinema or just have a movie trivia interest, Spice World certainly gives you more to argue about than Citizen Kain (sorry Orsen) or Pret-a-Porter (apologies to Robert too). If this movie was written by the Directors wife \u2013 she was a movie buff. It is better than you think!"

I love the light-hearted, jovial way this movie presents itself. It's a spoof. If people weren't so uptight, it would receive a much higher rating than it has. I'm almost fifty years old, and I have nine children. I have probably watched this movie over a hundred times. When I first got the DVD, I watched it with my kids almost every day. My wife thinks it just because I'm in love with the girls, whom I do think are beautiful, but it's actually because of the jokes. It's not just a few; the movie is full of them. I see it as being as funny as Monty Python or Benny Hill. It's the kind of humor you love to quote. I highly recommend it."

I definitely recommend it to any 90's fan, any former fan, or anybody who wants to watch a funny, cool, and enjoyable movie. The reason I wanted to watch it at first was because I wanted to remember the fun old days. It wins with flying colors. All of the Spice Girls have their own fun charm, and it's hard to hate them (unlike the crappy celebrities of today). SpiceWorld can take you back to a time when music was fun and cool, not a big puddle of self-pity. Some parts may not be quite exceptable for a younger viewer, though that's why it's rated PG. Everyone needs to see this movie, it's truly awesome!"

(I also think the Spice Girls are hot, and I have no problem watching them jump around.)\n\nIt features spunky actors, silly writing, cute British film tributes/references, neat cameos, fun music (if you like that kind of music that doesn't refer to killing, sex, or whining), and is an obvious ride on the merchandising train that the Spice Girls were.\n\nThere is nothing stupid, or bad about this movie. It's just simple fun. (And it features Sporty Spice!)\n\nIf you were expecting an Oscar contender, than you obviously have little clue about what this movie brings to the table. And if you think this movie was bad, and nothing but a bandwagon money grab, then you probably haven't seen Tomb Raider.\n\nI recommend this movie to people who have no preconceived notions, no prejudices against our little Pop-Tarts featured in this movie, and just want a giggle."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is a shame that most movies fail where an outrageous comedy such as Spice World succeeds. The back of the laserdisc that I purchased without seeing compared the movie as a cross between A Hard Day's Night and This Is Spinal Tap. You couldn't have a better comparison.\n\nI am not the biggest Spice girls fan, but writing this review in 2001 long after their 15 minutes of fame are over, I can be a little less closed-minded.\n\nHere is some questions that you in 2001 (and beyond) may ask of this movie:\n\n1) Is this movie is funny?\n\nYes it is, I agree that if you liked A Hard Day's Night you will enjoy Spice World also. It is funny in the very same nature. A pop sensation gets into all sorts of trouble when they have to be both a pop-group and true to themselves. It leads to some hilarious sequences, some in a dream state.\n\n2) Do I have to like the Spice Girls to enjoy Spice World?\n\nIt helps, looking back now on the \"Spice phenomenon\" of 1997-1998 I can think of no real reason why I disliked them, they are decent singers and each had their own distinctive style to them. It is funny in retrospect how much this group DID NOT share in the same style as the Backstreet Boys and N*Sync. The Spice Girls were separate entities, while today's boy bands aren't. The movie revels in this, each bit of dialog having wit and coming exactly from the lips of the characters that say them. Everything fits together beautifully and is seamless. Anyone with a sense of fun can enjoy this movie.\n\n3) Does the movie have camp appeal?\n\nAbsolutely. You have many many fun and campy scenes. Hear Roger Moore say \"A chicken without a head can only know where it came from, but cant see where it's going. Don't be that chicken!\" or hear Victoria tell Geri how to help a sick boy out, \"Why don't you take your top off for him?--I know I was just joking.\" To which Geri replies, \"I know. No real point in that though, his eyes are sealed shut--Oh look NOW there open!\" At it's very least Spice World has HUGE camp appeal and look for the hilarious Bob Hoskins cameo!\n\n4) Is watching Spice World a religious experience?\n\nNo. But you will have a good time if you have any sense of humour, and that is what movies are all about. Check it out, I bet you will like it!\n\nPeace out,\n\nShawn"

Don't know if she's playing herself and she just cartoonize herself even more. She has the best lines and she knows how to bring em.\n\nThe stupid situations are getting better.

The Spice girls in a way gathered all the pop life elements in their movie, mocking even themselves, they tried to show the world that this is all a fun ride and you must enjoy every minute of it while it lasts, and this is what they did in their 2 years world domination rally! You can't watch this movie though if you're a pop music or Spice Girls hater, if you are into pop and into light comedy and cheesy jokes then this movie is for your eyes only (a little wink to Roger Moore's cameo). Relax, get your best friend with whom you spent most of the 90's hearing ace of base and Take that on your CD player and enjoy this movie for old times sake! Now the acting, the plot, the script etc... They all fade into the background when you've got the Spice girls up front doing their thing!

The movie is not a film, it is the Spice Girls remaking a \"Hard Day's Night.\" But, you have to take that grain of salt in order to watch it. Those that despise the Spice Girls will probably never be convinced of it's humor and wittines, but those with open minds may see that this movie really does have something to offer (especially to the college age indie rock fan, if you have the sense of humor typically associated with this crowd, you may piss yourself laughing.)"

Other people, particularly adults, who so violently HATE this are a little disturbed, in my opinion. It's not supposed to be shakespeare and the girls never claimed to be Lawrence Olivier. It's silly, dumb and sugary sweet, and there's nothing wrong with that at all.\n\nWhen I was in college, this was the weekly free movie (we got to see one movie of their choosing a week for free if we showed our student ID at the door).

There are so many cameos, puns, inside jokes, and advanced jokes, it really is wasted on children (no matter how much they say they enjoyed it!). Me and my friend were guffawing along for almost the whole way. From the hilariously advanced one-liners to the stupidest dialogues - it will keep you in hysterics. The acting may be worse than on other movies, but the costuming, humour, action and music of these 5 (now 4) girls will catch your attention (and your heart). I now own both their cds, a few singles, dozens of posters and books, and of course the video! Spice up ya life and see it! See ya at Albert Hall!"

One thing about the Spice Girls was, they had a lot of control of what they did. They knew, that trying to make a serious movie would be a huge mistake. This movie is so enjoyable for anyone. Yes it is stupid, but in a really enjoyable way. The were a great group who knew what they were doing. Still enjoyable today. There are so many great appearances from great actors. They have Meat Loaf, Allan Cumming, Elton John, Elvis Costello, and the funny Roger Moore. With music and dance, and outrageous clothing, this movie is definitely a movie that will make the girls remembered for their enthusiasm, and their ability to make fun of themselves."
