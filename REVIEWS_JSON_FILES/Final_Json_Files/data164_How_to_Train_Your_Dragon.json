        "review_title": "Genuinely superb and a step forward in 3D films",
        "review_detailed_main": "HTTYD is the latest in a run of animated 3D films to hit the family market. One might be forgiven for feeling a little weary of this genre as the big production studios churn out one \"action-packed film with a cute central character and some pretty effects\" after another. But wait...\n\nHTTYD stands apart from these other attempts for a number of reasons. First, the 3D (Odeon digital in this screening) is moving more toward the subtle with fewer \"gratuitous\" 3D moments than in movies like Bolt and Coraline. As 3D becomes a staple of high street cinema, directors seem to be finding 3D to be more about adding depth rather than a brief focal-point. That's not to say that there isn't effective use of the 3D wow-factor here; it's just not all the film has to hold attention.\n\nSecond, a cast of voice talent that does not demand too much consideration of the man/woman behind the microphone is refreshing. Baruchel is not over-playing the sugar or the heroics and, as much as an animated character can be, he is believable and as three-dimensional as the visuals. Butler is not greatly stretched here but manages to stay just the right side of a Mike Myers impression so as not to annoy. How many kids will now think the Vikings were a fearsome race of Americans and Scots? Oh, well!\n\nThird, the plot and dialogue. You may not know the plot and I won't spoil it now. It is straightforward stuff but the pace keeps it interesting for kids and the grown-ups. Younger children may be upset at times and I heard a sob or two at the emotional moments. Nothing too heavy here though, it's just a well-written script with as many actual laughs as I have seen in a kids' film.\n\nThis is one of the best films so far in this prolific genre and it has been made with passion rather than thrown together to cash-in on the thirst for these films, right now. I would urge all ages to see this film in 3D as the textures are extraordinary and you can't help but be charmed by it all."

        "review_detailed_main": "With a somewhat unwieldy tile and the lack of the winning Pixar storyline that has dominated the Oscars for a decade, Dreamworks animations latest could have been a clunker. Not only is How to Train Your Dragon the best film of the year so far, but it even eclipses the quality of last years duel academy award winner Up.\n\nThe latest 3-D film to fly into theatres in so many weeks is also the best of its format (story wise), making Burton's overblown misfire Alice in Wonderland look even more pitiful. Dragon will no doubt enamour kids (excuse the clich\u00e9) of all ages while keeping parents not only awake but equally enthralled. This movie is sure to tug the hearts of anyone who has ever loved a pet and will undoubtedly draw tears from those who are so inclined.\n\nThe texture that can be created from today's CG technology never ceases to amaze. Consider a beautiful tracking shot of a downed dragon where the twisted wing that protrudes towards the screen is actually out of focus, as if you yourself were staring awestruck at the giant lizard that lay before you in real, tangible life. I did not have the pleasure to viewing How to Train Your Dragon in 3-D but I have heard great things and even without having paid a surcharge the film does in no way suffer as a result. The narrative, visuals, writing and voicework is ample reason to seek out Dragon and frankly is the real heart of the movie anyways.\n\nOn the Island of Berk, the Viking community that lives there does not fear a rival tribe, the weather or disease but rather a much more toothy threat: dragons. Nightly raids by the winged beasts have forged a great hatred upon the tribe and led by the aptly named Stoik the Vast (Gerard Butler) they wage war with the intent to rid themselves of dragons once and for all. This is not a feeling shared by Stoik's scrawny son Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) who favours non-lethal tactics as much as he does blacksmithing. Much to Hiccup's surprise, during one of the aforementioned raids he is able to down a dragon with one of his contraptions. Intent on proving his manhood to Stoik, he seeks out to find the dragon know as a Night Fury but finds himself unable to slay his scaly foe. So begins an unlikely and forbidden friendship with the later named Toothless that follows a time-tested but absolutely rewarding arc that is as enthralling as it is touching.\n\nJoining Butler and Baruchel, both of whom give excellent performances (with Butler recapturing some of his 300 mojo), are the likes of Craig Fergusson as the Viking blacksmith, America Ferrera as the feisty object of Hiccup's affections and a whole slice of the Apatow gang including Kristen Wiig, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Jonah Hill as other young warriors. Much like WALL-E, Toothless exhibits oodles of personality and is endlessly endearing. To achieve this level of depth is perhaps even more impressive due to the fact that he never utters a word and must emote through non-verbal means.\n\nAlong with Kung Fu Panda this movie represents the highest ilk of the Dreamworks repertoire and that is not a backhanded compliment by any means. Like Panda, there are thrilling and well choreographed action sequences to compliment the heart, and plenty of humour to keep this from becoming too much of a dramatic slog for younger theatre goers. Teenager or adult, fan or animation or not if you like truly good cinema, you will not be unsatisfied by How to Train Your Dragon.\n\nRead all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "I am not at all interested in dragons and all such fantasy creatures. I don't like children movies with all their stupid messages. I saw this movie rather just to pass the time than to watch it for its sake. And Whoa! I was drawn in this river in first 5 minutes. And what a experience it has been! Right from the start as the narrator describes his world, you are immediately there. You feel yourself in the characters place. The movie does that for you. This is very uncommon movie and it has set a milestone for 3D, not because of its technical aspects, but because of the Depth this movie has. This movie is as much for a 7 year old as it is for an old man who has seen a lot of life. This movie will entertain each viewer in his own way. This is a masterpiece! This movie isn't what it sounds on the surface. It has layers of meanings attached to it. Look at just the title: How to train your Dragon!. If you see it carefully you will notice that there is more to it than meets the eye. Watch the movie and you will know what i mean. This movie cleverly comments on Human Fear, War, Friendship, prejudices, courage, Love. ........................... Don't miss this movie or you will miss one of the few periods when you really LIVE. Note: Just remember to carry your heart with you when you see this movie. It will fill your heart with nothing but what should truly belong there. 10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched How to Train Your Dragon about 5 times now, and it never gets boring. It actually keeps on getting better and better with with more and more views. This is a huge accomplishment for DreamWorks Animation, it might actually be its Best Animated Feauture it yet. It is an amazing experience to watch this film in Cinema. The 3D is amazing and at times Breathtaking. I may of had the most fun that I've ever had in Cinema watching How to Train Your Dragon.\n\nThe script is really good and is has a lot of dramatic depth. This movie is for everyone. Adults and Kids will enjoy it equally and will love it at the end. This movie will probably become a series like Shrek. But I'm hoping this film doesn't get bad sequels like Shrek 3 and Shrek Forever After. Anyways this film will be most recognized for its beautiful animation.\n\n10/10 Highly Recommended"

That was certainly not the case. There are way better parts that were left to be discovered and I definitely congratulate the choice.\n\nI didn't read the book, so I don't know the story, witch might have suffered, as stories usually do from books to picture, but I think a writer couldn't hope for a better image, better portraits of characters, especially the black dragon who one definitely falls in love with - the mimic and the gestures and the face expressions, so complex and real.\n\nI agree it's not the kind of movie that makes you keep thinking too much once it's finished bot it's not meant to be. It's just lovely, from the beginning to the end, I really laughed and I was anxious for the characters when they suffered (and I'm 22). The film wasn't too long, it didn't have stupid lines whatsoever and it put to silence the annoying child behind me from the first five minutes or so, which I believe says it all.\n\nI don't know if I will actually go to the cinema but I definitely want to see it again.\n\nGreat special effects and, again, a very lovely dragon."

        "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: How to Train Your Dragon",
        "review_detailed_main": "If this is done following the same old beat up formula that Hollywood sticks to with regards to animation, then the dragons will be yakking non-stop. Thank goodness that this film, directed by Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, avoids this like the plague, and\n\nJay Baruchel voices Hiccup, a viking kid who happens to be more brains than brawn, more scrawny than buffed, and this of course sets him apart from the rest of his warrior clan folks, who are battle scarred from the constant defense of the village pests - dragons who come from afar to plunder their livestock and setting their houses on fire, so much so that every house on the block is relatively brand new. Wanting to help out in any way he can, he's deemed more of a liability than an asset, especially when even his dad Stoick (Gerard Butler) cannot appreciate his unique, technical talent.\n\nIn a stroke of uncanny luck, Hiccup downs a flying dragon in the heat of battle, and his compassion meant to set the dragon free, rather than trying to prove himself to be a worthy viking man by killing it. And it's a rare specimen of a dragon too, which would have brought him instant glory. So a bond between man and mythical beast gets struck, and christened as Toothless, this is one pest who slowly grows into a pet, with Hiccup's secret rendezvous resulting in growing appreciation for the species, despite what the knowledge that his kinsman had compiled into a Dragon compendium which details facts all ending with an advisory on compulsory annihilation.\n\nThe story here is the strength of the film, being witty, smart but never condescending nor insulting the intelligence of the audience. While most characters are caricatures, especially Hiccup's peers, a lot of effort have been put into creating the leads as multi-dimensional and full of heart, and I enjoyed how the characters are so open to their emotions, that it becomes a lot more real than the photo realistic 3D animation and effects. Sure there's the usual father-son misunderstanding and expectations, and how a zero turns to hero, or even the theme of fearing something that we don't fully comprehend, but it's the manner in which the usual got delivered, that made all the difference. Especially so for its anti-war stance, that all it takes is a little step back from the common battle-cry, and instead seek to be understood, by holding out an olive branch, and to understand first.\n\nFor those who enjoy the mythology of the dragon creature, there are a number of ideas thrown up in the film that would make you nod in appreciation how these got conjured up for the film, and they worked wonders, even though they may be a tad predictable plot wise. And I'm betting that a lot of folks out there will take to Toothless, thanks to its \"stitch\"-ish design similar to Lilo and Stitch (since it's co-director Chris Sander's previous work) and huge saucer like eyes, plus a lovable demeanour built into the character that's always apprehensive, and mischievous. Being the creature that has no track record also helped, since it ropes you into a journey of friendship, bonding and discovery with Hiccup as to how powerful his new found friend can be, not to mention how symbiotic their relationship will evolve into as well.\n\nAction junkies will find the action sequences in the film faultless, and the 3D got specifically crafted for certain set action pieces that really had me ducking for cover, for once. Fights are incredible, and always accompanied either by humour that worked without the feeling that it was deliberate nor just tried too hard, coupled with the comedic voice talents such as Jonah Hill and Christopher Mintz-Plasse.\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon is similar to last year's Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs - Long titles, great story, beautiful animation and a total delight. Highly recommended, and it goes into my list as contenders for best films of this year!"

The story is not the most original (except for the original premise) but it's very well told, with good character development and has a fairly good morale for those into that. The effects and animation is stunning. Very well done.The story was entertaining to watch and it didn't really drag on like other animated films. One thing I didn't really like, is that there's a part of the ending that we've seen a hundred times before especially in kids movies and I would have preferred a little more originality there or at least see it better done because I didn't really buy into it. Very clich\u00e9d and should have been better in my opinion"

        "review_detailed_main": "A movie that is good fun and yet has some clich\u00e9d stuff that makes it more predictable.\n\nOne would easily fall into the movie because it has every slot of a very entreating and moreover an animated movie. It has action, drama adventure romance and even humour. It's a story of a dragon and a boy understanding their language and vice-versa that is the dragon understanding the boy's language. But how come the dragons understand whatever each one speaks in yet to be deciphered by me coz I did not get that point.\n\nAlso, this film has some breath taking visuals that are tailor made for the 3D effects and to ensure that what 3D is about is known to the viewer. Look at those dragon rides in the sky. These were taken from Avatar if I have to believe so. The visual affects are for sure great and some scenes are written well too. But overall there is something that this movie lacks and that is a heart. It did not make me go for that boy called \"Hiccup\" to do what he wants to do. Neither did it make me feel for the dragon who has got one wing only and flies with the help of an artificial wing made by Hiccup.\n\nIt is a movie that is good and surely and assuringly entertaining it brings laughs and makes us woo to sometime but such laughs are few and far in between. The kids have liked it as I saw in theatre way back in 2010 and even yesterday, my sister loved it and I did not like it enough, maybe I need more of a fluidity than the commercial rigidity.\n\nI would go a 3/5 for a surely entertaining and good animated feature but it missed the point of flowing and thus stuck with what the kids would like more than what the story is about."

        "review_detailed_main": "In an age where 3D technology is becoming the primary appendage to \"hook\" audiences in, it's refreshing to watch a film that uses it more as an accessory than the main attraction (*cough* Avatar *cough*). Directed by Dean Deblois and Chris Sanders (Lilo & Stitch) the film is set around a Viking village on the island of Berk that is periodically raided by dragons that steal from their flock of sheep. The film follows the adventures of Hiccup, a scrawny, awkward and socially outcast Viking boy who aspires to follow the tradition of his tribe in becoming a dragon-slayer, only to discover that he does not share his fellow Vikings' brutish nature.\n\nThe film itself is visually stunning with beautifully drawn landscapes and characters. The dragons are especially well crafted, ranging from a fire-breathing monster to a comical flying blowfish. Although I was sceptical at first, the 3D elements were also a nice touch. It made the island of Berk a little more immersive, without overshadowing the film completely. However, where the film really shines is in its musical score, which is brilliantly composed and enhances the emotion of every scene it is used in.\n\nLike any film, however, How to train your Dragon has its flaws. It heavily relies on slapstick humour which, although funny at first, quickly got stale. The first 20 minutes were particularly weak, to the point where after the characters were introduced the humour became extremely lacklustre and the entire plot seemed to stall for a good 5 minutes or so. Also, without giving too much away, the central message of the film is basically thrown out the window during the climax which made the film seem like a slightly shallow experience as I left the cinema.\n\nDespite the critique, How to train your Dragon was a fun film. No, it's no Pixar's Up, but it makes for a fun, heart-warming and light-hearted hour and 20 minutes. Check it out."

I'm a grown man, but somehow this movie managed to ignore all the layers of cynicism and fake toughness we grown-ups tend to build around ourselves to cope with life; it cut right through to the wide-eyed, adventure-loving boy in me, right through to the heart. It's impossible not to fall in love with this movie, with these characters - especially if you love wild animals. This beautiful story of a very unlikely friendship between a boy who's a bit of an outcast and a dragon is just so well done; it's never cheesy, yet full of passion, and there's simply not a dull moment in it.\n\nAnd although it's very funny, this really isn't just an accumulation of gags and one-liners loosely held together by a paper-thin story: this is a great adventure and touching coming-of-age tale where the protagonist has an actual arc; it tells an intelligent and compelling story about people who are not just one-note characters, and they're wonderfully realized through the great voice-work of such actors as Jay Baruchel, America Ferrera, Gerard Butler and Craig Ferguson. The animation is fantastic, and there's so much playful creative energy at display in the design of the characters - especially in the design of all the different dragon species - that it's simply a joy to watch. 10 stars out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "This was one of the moments, when you feel so overwhelmed by a movie, that you want to see it again immediately.And when i think of how the whole movie-going began-a theater, full of annoying, noisy kids, 3-th graders mostly.\n\nBut in the end, you realize you haven't spent any time listening to them, because you are so fascinated by the movie.You feel you are alone in the otherwise overcrowded theater.This feeling is very precious and when you realize it, you know you loved it.\n\nThe whole idea is very interesting-alternate Dragon-fighting times, an era of vikings and so many kinds of winged creatures.The main character, Hiccup, is the son of a mighty Dragon fighter-Stoick, who is the vikings chief as well.He wants to teach his son the Dragon fighting ways of the vikings, but the boy befriends one of the Dragons, a very rare kind, almost impossible to find.He names it Toothless and they are in for a lot of adventures.\n\nThe movie is very fresh, but solid and strong as well.And considering it is an animation, the voice performances are very good.That is also important.But the truly strongest sides of the movie are the heart of the movie-it is really a moving picture, but i think, that the level of maturity of the movie is higher, than DreamWorks's previous efforts like \"Shrek\".It is more meaningful, and although it is a Dragon-fighting story it is more real than most of the studio's previous tries in this genre and definitely a step up in animation.The feelings, the emotions, that were expressed throughout made this animation such a memorable experience, and i'm sure, i won't be able to forget it, at least not soon.\n\n\"How to Train Your Dragon\" is a new, fresh, different start in the animation genre, with a lot of heart and emotions.I think, that's one of the best animations ever made.I recommend it to everyone-from parents with children to more experienced moviegoers and for the more mature audiences as well.\n\n\"How to Train Your Dragon\" is the best movie this year so far, and a honestly moving picture.An animation masterpiece!\n\n*****/*****"

In similar fashion to their previous work, we have an unlikely human creature friendship. They have a real talent for making unusual animals that are both parts frightening and adorable. They also take some tired storytelling tropes and do it with such likable characters that you forgive the clich\u00e9s.\n\nWhat keeps me from rating this as high as most is the underwhelming ending and the tired, predictable story beats.\n\nIf you ever get the chance to watch this film in theatres in 3D, do not hesitate. The movie is beautiful in animation and in music. It is a delight for the eyes and ears.\n\nThe movie has a lot of grit to it. It is not toothless."

        "review_detailed_main": "An animated feast for the eyes is a brilliant description for this film. From the jaw-dropping visuals beautifully rendered in 3D, to the flawless animation of the characters and dragons, this was one film that didn't disappoint.\n\nOur protagonist is Hiccup, a boy viking who doesn't possess much in common with his dragon slaying dad. However, when he finds a new friend in Toothless, the most feared dragon of its species, he learns that dragons are not the fearful creatures he was brought up to believe.\n\nWhat I enjoyed the most was the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless the dragon. This was dealt with wonderfully and we see their relationship develop over a series of scenes which were done with great humour and action.\n\nThe 3D holds its own in every sense, and I would go as far as saying that some scenes rival the groundbreaking Avatar. The scenes that especially stood out were the flying segments where the dragon soars over crystal clear sea's and jaw-dropping backdrops.\n\nWhilst this is a film that may seem as if it's solely directed at the younger generation, its stunning visuals and well-told story means that it will keep any adult satisfied."

You still root for the good guy and the way things turn out is also a bit refreshing. It's not as straight forward as good guy vs bad guy, bad guy loses."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's far better then all those Shrecks, Toy stories, Ratatoulies, Puss in boots, Mega-minds and other \"renewing\" concepts. Why? It's simple and honest. This movie doesn't TRY to be funny, modern, super-wise, and \"for all\". It's not one of those \"hey-let's-make-a-movie-about-cat-who-is-a-super-spy\" concepts. This movie JUST tells the simple yet very good story in the most proper way.\n\nI have seen a lot of 3D animated movies - American, European, Asian. This one hits 10 in my opinion, because it's by far the most complete vision enclosed in a 3D animated form. But - in addition - it's a pure fairy tale in the core. And I mean PURE - from the cores of fairy-telling, which is the most polite, elegant way of TEACHING important stuff. I think that 3D movie is not only craftsmanship behind creating artificial environment, animating believably, lighting sets with care, etc., etc. Like any other movie - it should be a well told story, which will left you ...CHANGED a bit (that's what fairy tales do, right?) Only those kind of stories will matter in your life. Rest is just \"fun\".\n\n'How to train your dragon' is a modern fairy tale. It's modern because - like other mainstream 3D movies - it's excellently crafted. We have here great animation (Toothless, the dragon is \"made of life\", so to speak - you actually just want to HAVE one), lighting and cinematography (splendid flight scenes, which take your breath away, and make you climb your chair), effects, etc.... But it's a fairy tale because - above all that - we have here a master degree directing by Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders too. All those decisions made by them - from very basic (like the look of Toothless and other characters, or editing), to more important (like balancing the amounts of fear, sadness, seriousness and fun tones in the story) are marks of wisdom. And those decisions made a difference between this movie and \"the rest\". Those decisions crafted a SOUL in it. And achieving this \"soul level\" should be a goal of every director.\n\nSumming up: great movie in at least two aspects. Technically (character design, animation, cinematography, editing) and emotionally (great simple story with surprisingly 'non-hollywoodish' wise moral, fantastic heart-touching score by John Powell, and mature directing which guide you to be changed a bit after watching).\n\nBest achievement in 3D storytelling since Euclide :)"

The only things the film has in common with the book are names and dragons. As a huge fan of the HTTYD series, this film is a real disappointment. I like the books because they view dragons differently. You don't have dragons as the good guys in many stories, but Cressida Cowell makes them into companions of the Vikings. I feel this film completely ruins the point of the books. Because the stories are so different, if/when they come to make a sequel, they will have to make up a completely new storyline. The characters are all wrong which makes it impossible to sympathise with them. Astrid isn't even a character in the books! For any fans of the books, there is no way I would recommend this to them. It destroys all the meaning of Cowell's books."

        "review_detailed_main": "...not that this is necessarily saying much, since the films of the past decade are either made for the Academy Awards with some social message that hits the audience over the head with a social justice sledgehammer, or they are action films with lots of car chases and explosions and comic book heroes or they are 50 shades of obscene. But I digress.\n\nThis animated film is beautiful to watch, but that is not the main drawing point. The drawing point are the characters. Even though this is set in some fictitious land full of Vikings beset with fire breathing dragons who are always raiding their livestock, you can easily relate to everybody. The main character, Hiccup, is the son of the warrior king of the Vikings. Hiccup is mild mannered, lanky, awkward - your typical teen of about age 14. He likes to build and invent things. Dad wants his son to be a dragon slayer. So one day, during an attack by the dragons, Hiccup actually catches one with one of his inventions. He grabs a knife and runs into the forest to kill the dragon to make dad happy. But he just can't. This \"fearsome\" dragon is tame, passive, dog-like before people had dogs. And so \"Toothless\" as Hiccup names him, becomes like a pet to Hiccup. The pair develop this beautiful unbreakable bond. And Hiccup learns about dragons.\n\nHiccup is signed up for Dragon Killing class with the rest of the island's teens. Hiccup quickly rises to the top of his class but manages to not kill even one dragon. Instead he uses the techniques of bonding with dragons that he has learned from Toothless to subdue them into harmless pets. Nobody questions what is going on but Astrid, a tomboyish teen girl who just knows Hiccup is up to something.\n\nThis film has genuine laughs, thrills, the real problems of sons and fathers disappointing and misunderstanding one another, the awkwardness of that first romance, and the idea that sometimes your enemy may be your enemy for reasons you don't understand.\n\nI watched this for about the tenth time last night and I have to say it just never gets old. Highly recommended."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's a reason why I watched How To Train Your Dragon 7 times when it was still playing in theatres. No, it wasn't because I was young and didn't know how to better manage my money (although to be honest, it was a little bit of this). It's because HTTYD had a unique way of unfolding its story. A story about an unlikely relationship that truly moved my heart--between the now very well-known dynamic-duo, Hiccup and Toothless.\n\nThroughout the movie, you see each of them grow in awareness about one another, but also in awareness about themselves. This, I think, is what makes their relationship so much more than what meets the eye: before they even know it, they are accepting themselves for their own insecurities and learning not to judge others by first glance.\n\nTo top off the many hidden lessons, the screenplay is nicely paced and super quirky/funny (a lot of laughs in all the right places). I also think John Powell did an excellent job with the soundtrack (and when I'm not watching the movie, I sometimes just listen to the soundtrack--yes, you could say I'm just a little obsessed).\n\nEver since I was little to today, I have always managed to feel the same childish wonder and magic that I felt that first time I saw HTTYD in a movie theatre. And I can honestly say that I don't think that feeling will ever go away."

Such a perfect amount of time spent on the build-up; especially the bonding; and the climax. It has one of the best (thought through) story lines.

The leader Stoik the Vast is unsuccessfully trying to destroy the fearful Night Fury and locate the dragon's nest to destroy them. His clumsy and inventive son Hiccup works as a blacksmith and dreams on becoming a dragon killer.\n\nAfter a raid of dragons during the night, Hiccup uses the weapon he had invented and he hits the Night Fury. However, he has no witness and nobody in the village believes on his words. Stoik the Vast sails with the Vikings to look for the dragon nest and Hiccup decides to seek out the dragon in the woods, and finds it with a severed tail and can not fly again. Hiccup calls him Toothless and they become friends. The boy uses his skill and manufactures a prosthesis for Toothless and he leans how to control the flight of Toothless.\n\nHiccup learns why the dragons attack his village and finds that his own people had misjudged them. But his great defeat is to prove his father how intolerant the Vikings have been against the dragon.\n\n\"How to Train Your Dragon\" is a delightful animation with a wonderful message of friendship, intolerance, misjudgment, peace and harmony. The directors and writers succeed in telling how important is to understand other people using the metaphor of the dragons in an original way and with an unusual conclusion. The message of this film is highly recommended for politicians, religious leaders, military intelligence and governors of the world. My vote is nine.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Como Treinar o Seu Drag\u00e3o\" (\"How to Train Your Dragon\")"

        "review_detailed_main": "There seems to be an abundance of terrible animated 'family' films around these days, all characterised by the same flaws; unnecessarily complex storylines, inappropriate adult themes, overwhelming cluttered CGI and sickly self-righteous characters.\n\nHow To Train Your Dragon is free of most of these issues. It is an imaginative yet straightforward tale, appropriate for all ages and visually impressive without being chaotic. It is also a nice runtime of under 100 minutes, far more digestible than these baffling 2-hour marathons that today's ADHD generation of sugar-filled children have no chance of following.\n\nMy main problem with animations is that it can be so difficult to connect with the characters. Hiccup is quite bland and cloying, churning out the usual clich\u00e9s and self-aware nerd humour. Astrid is equally one-dimensional and fails badly as a supposed love interest. The older Vikings are just stereotyped background fodder and don't add any depth to the story. As a result, I couldn't really get into this film and found it quite dull, despite the brilliant animation."

        "review_detailed_main": "I love animation, always have done, always will do, and I was blown away by How to Train Your Dragon. Granted, not all Dreamworks movies are bad, Prince of Egypt is one of the most stirring and evocative films let alone animated films I have seen, Shrek was very original and funny and Spirit:Stallion of the Cimarron is their most underrated I feel. I will say too, How to Train Your Dragon along with Prince of Egypt is my absolute favourite of Dreamworks, and one of the best of 2010.\n\nThe story is very engaging; there is nothing too sophisticated for kids and nothing too childish for adults. It is instead an intelligent, moving story that moves along at a good pace, and I for one didn't find it that predictable, and I loved the bonding scenes between Toothless and Hiccup which were suitably poignant. The script is also very strong, it is thoughtful and touching at times but also amusing when it needs to be.\n\nThe characters are another strength. Hiccup is appealing as a protagonist, and Toothless is really quite cute for a dragon. Hiccup's father Stoick is a good character too, he is gruff and such but you can tell he cares for his son. The voice acting too I had no problem with, to me they did fit well with the characters, Jay Baruchal's excitement and enthusiasm contrasts wonderfully with Gerard Butler's restrained, gruff yet sensitive performance.\n\nWhere How to Train Your Dragon really excels though are in its visuals and music score. The animation is outstanding, while the characters are modelled convincingly the real revelations are in the stunning flying sequences and the beautiful lavish backgrounds. Oh and the fight sequences are equally spectacular, haunting but also very gripping and almost epic. John Powell's score is a revelation, and one of my favourite scores in a film of recent times. Sometimes soaring, sometimes dramatic, sometimes energetic, in fact no matter what mood is conveyed, the score compliments it to perfection.\n\nSo overall, there is very little else to say about this film, other than to say it is a must-see in my opinion. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "How to train your dragon is another good animation provided by DreamWorks where the main character is a viking boy named Hiccup who is more like the kid-with-brain than the kid-with-muscles. He always wanted to prove himself worthy in battling real dragons but life decided for him that he will prove worthy to himself by understanding those creatures. He somehow manages by luck to hurt and \"catch\" the \"Night Fury\", the dragon everyone wanted to catch, but instead of killing him he finds his own fear and loneliness into Fury's eyes, making him to spare his life. From that point the story goes on and is delivered quite well for this type of movies though I have some complains about continuity or even logic but I'll keep those to myself.\n\nWhat I did not like about this was the voices. And when I say the voices I don't mean that they didn't act well but one question hit me from the beginning: Why all those different English accents in the same actual group? You got irish, Scottish and American accents which makes no actual sense. But I guess that was the fault of the casting team. Anyway besides that everything seemed pretty original and entertaining.\n\nThe characters were not that great developed I mean it was the usual stuff but I won't be \"trolling\" to call them clich\u00e9s. The dialogue suffered here and there and some action-scenes especially when Hiccup was training were ridiculous like when the dragon chased all of them in that ring, Hiccup was very relaxed and kept on asking Gobber things about the \"Night Fury\" which was kind of you know.. lame... because who would do that even if you're a nerd you're still scared or at least concerned about the dragon that chases you...\n\nBesides this the movie was edited well, same goes for the cinematography, music was good but nothing tremendous and the 3D was really great as far as the effects and all... but with all these the movie missed something for me... 8.3 on IMDb almost the equal of \"Up\" or Wall E... I mean... this is one overrated movie... It's good for kids, families and all of that but not that good that anyone could find it appealing because it doesn't develop any real emotions at all... feeling sorry for your father's wishes as for your destiny, finding the good in what people saw bad, the girl who's indifference changed into interest for you and all that are clich\u00e9s and they are used in so many animation movies that I can't give this one propz even if it's entertaining and fun to watch. And talking about characters and dialogue, it was pretty cheesy at moments, few major jokes and few characters that you would remember after leaving the theaters like people still remember the pigeons from Bolt or the Hamster... because they were ridiculously funny... here? I did not get that feeling...\n\nAs far as the score I didn't actually felt it... It was good I guess it fitted the movie's personality but it was no near Up, Wall E or Coraline... to mention some animations from the last 2 years...\n\nMovie is well executed, but it seriously has it's ups and downs and it's downs should count more since it's so overrated..."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I saw this film tonight, I was completely bowled over from start to finish. I have simply never seen a better looking computer generated film nor a film that used 3-D to such wonderful effect. Finally--a film that doesn't look like the 3_D doesn't look like it was tossed in as an afterthought--but was clearly intended as one all along. However, I will warn you NOT to waste your time seeing it in 2-D---the film loses too much of its artistry. Now I know some of you will think I am a total sap for saying this, but the film literally brought tears to my eyes because it was so beautiful. I simply couldn't believe how special and artistic this movie was--it completely exceeded my expectations. This is because the advertising campaign make this movie look like it's just another kids' movie--and nothing more. But, with a lovely plot, interesting characters, the best CGI on Earth, a terrific sound track and lots of surprises, this simply is a joy to watch. Nornally when I review a film I try to talk about the film's flaws...but I simply couldn't find any. At last, a 3-D CGI film that actually manages to be better looking than last year's \"Up\"! It is hard to imagine a film being any better--though I am sure five years from now, I will be seeing even better 3-D and computer generated films...and it boggles the mind! See this film!\n\nUPDATE: I saw this on a huge home television. While the wonderful 3-D was missing, the film still had the nicest CGI and was nearly as entertaining as it was in the theater."

        "review_detailed_main": "How to Train Your Dragon is a fine animated excursion into mamby pamby land for children but it is not so inane as to drive adults nuts. Those less critical of movies will certainly enjoy the film a great deal more than I did, but it is a fine movie none the less.\n\nHiccup (Jay Baruchel) is a scrawny and geeky Viking whose father is chief dragon slayer of the clan. Try as he might Hiccup can't seem to do anything right and his attempts to prove himself backfire and make things worse for everyone. He reminds me very much of Flik, the main character A Bug's Life. Both are misfits looking for approval and eventually they win acceptance by having a series of adventures where they learn to be themselves and teach a valuable lesson to the rest of the clan/colony.\n\nHiccup's adventure involves a dragon he manages to bring down with one of his quirky inventions. Nobody believes him so he sets off in search of the dragon so he can slay it and win approval from his father and the rest of the village. He finds himself unable to do the deed and ultimately ends up befriending the dragon, which acts in much the same manner as a house cat. His experiences with the dragon allow Hiccup to gain valuable insights into the nature of the ferocious beasts, it turns out they are more like dogs and cats than flying lizards. The story is rather formulaic but it is cute, which is pretty much what you are looking for in this type of movie.\n\nThere are several animated movies of a similar nature that I liked more than How to Train Your Dragon, Monsters, Inc. and The Incredibles come to mind, but it is still a movie that is probably worth watching, especially if you have children. I promise they will love the film and it won't leave you wanting to claw your eyes out, in fact, you will probably like it too."

        "review_detailed_main": "The trailer of this movie was so unpromising and unattractive. It did not make me want to watch this, in 3D no less. However, my kids all wanted to watch it, so of course, my wife and I had to go with them.\n\nThe first one-fourth of the movie was very static and slow for me, all talk. I felt very sleepy and was in fact, drifting off. I did not really immediately like the appearance of the kids, which I found generally annoying. However, when time came that our hero (with the improbable name of Hiccup) met his cute dragon pal (with the equally improbable name of Toothless), the movie picked up pace and from there, it never looked back.\n\nThe next three fourths of the film was alive with beautiful 3D animation and very heartfelt and touching writing. I know we have all seen flying dragons before (like in \"Shrek\"), but the additional animated depth and the fantastic background scenery gave this one a breath-taking quality that made it distinct. The very meticulous and larger-than life scenes of the Viking armada at sea, the Vikings running from the exploding mountain, and especially the final climactic battle, were truly in a class of their own. That is saying a lot in these times when 3D animation seems to be the standard already, and not the exception.\n\nThe story of the rough tough father and his weakling son has been played in out in various ways in so many various movies before. But somehow, the way it is played out here still managed to be effective in drawing out genuine emotions. The straightforward storyline and familiar conflicts were successfully brought to a higher level by the original vision and masterful direction of Dean de Blois and Chris Sanders (of \"Lilo and Stitch\"). This is a shoo-in for one of the nominee slots in the Best Animated Feature Oscar for the coming year."

        "review_title": "The best 2010 release I've seen so far \u2013 and one of the best animated films to hit theaters in a very long time",
        "review_detailed_main": "I remember watching the adorable Disney flick Lilo & Stitch at the theater back in the summer of 2002, after a truly exhausting week. The film - which tells the story of a small girl that befriends a wacky alien she mistakes for a dog - managed to put an enormous smile on my face, and made me forget of all my other worries for a while.\n\nWhile watching Dreamwork's new masterpiece, How to Train Your Dragon, I couldn't help but think about the similarities between both it and the aforementioned Lilo & Stitch. Toothless, the lead dragon character from the new film resembles the alien Stitch in shape as well as in behavior. Hiccup, the main human character which befriends Toothless despite warnings from his fellow Vikings, is a semi middle-age teenage version of the character Lilo. A trip visit to IMDb cleared things up for me - Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, the same people who directed the 2002 wonder (L & S) are behind the new and awesome How to Train Your Dragon.\n\nFortunately enough, the similarities end here, and this is not a carbon copy of that film - even though the bottom line (tolerance toward people who are different, etc.) is the same. However, this new film takes place in the middle ages, in a small village which is repeatedly attacked by seemingly vicious dragons. Stoick (voiced by the almighty Gerard Butler) is the head of the village, a pumped up manly Viking who leads the counter-attacks against the fierce dragons. His teenage son, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), however, doesn't quite fit in. Unlike the older Vikings, who speak in an Irish accent, he sounds like your average American teenager. He's also skinny and small and not exactly the material Viking warriors are made of.\n\nAfter a nightly battle between Vikings and dragons, Hiccup discovers Toothless, a supposedly lethal dragon, which has lost its ability to fly after being injured in the fight. Without anyone knowing, Hiccup slowly gains Toothless' confidence, and the two gradually learn to know each other. After the primal fears disappear, they realize they actually have a great deal to learn about one another \u2013 and that friendship is always better than hostility. Soon enough, Hiccup trains Toothless and learns how to approach dragons in general, something that doesn't quite fit in with his father, friends, and the society he lives in in general. But when a greater threat reveals itself, the Vikings and the dragons discover their only hope is to put aside their prejudice thoughts and fight together \u2013 with Hiccup and Toothless being their best hope for victory.\n\nBottom line \u2013 How to Train Your Dragon is a major victory for the guys at Dreamworks. The film is truly inspiring, with a story that feels self-contained and complete, one that doesn't need to rely on pop culture references to succeed (unlike many of their other products). After a long period of mediocre products (in my opinion) that pale next to their Pixar counterparts, Dreamworks Animation finally came out with the winning formula \u2013 which contains just the right amount of relatable characters and true emotions, stunning visuals (including Nordic landscapes and various species of beautiful dragons) and a 3-D element (that uses InTru technology) that really works for a change.\n\nDespite the similarities to Lilo & Stitch, I came out feeling that Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders actually managed to improve on their winning hit, and create the best 2010 release I've seen so far \u2013 and one of the best animated films to hit theaters in a long long time."

This movie is fun especially in 3D! Gerard Butler was perfect for Stoick the Vast. Jay Baruchel was good. but America Ferrera's performance was bad. This is better than \"AVATAR\" and \"Monsters Vs.

        "review_detailed_main": "For a decade now, Dreamworks has had to carry the uncomfortable burden of playing second fiddle to that animation behemoth, Pixar. If this was a family, Disney's Pixar would be the older, ambitious sister, the one always doted upon and destined for greatness, and Dreamworks would be her cruder but sometimes more entertaining brother. However, the rivalry between the two studios seems to be fodder for the media more than anything else. Instead of stewing in jealousy or attempting to outdo Pixar, Dreamworks opts to stay true to itself and to fashion its own path to success; in fact, the studio could act as the protagonist in one of its own movies. With movies like the Shrek franchise, Madagascar and Monsters vs. Aliens, Dreamworks tends to aim for entertainment rather than art, simplicity over depth and the funny bone over the brain. For the most part, their latest film, How to Train Your Dragon, stays faithful to this trend.\n\nStrongly reminiscent of the 1999 movie The Iron Giant, Dragon employs Dreamworks's most reliable formula: that of the misfit underdog who ultimately gets his chance to shine and learns a valuable lesson along the way, usually on the lines of the ever-popular \"be yourself\" mantra of most kids movies. Though The Iron Giant was superior overall, How to Train Your Dragon does possess a lot of the same earnestness and heart as that film. The scenes devoted to the emerging bond between Hiccup and Toothless are the best in the movie, and their relationship feels organic and natural instead of coming across as a corny plot device. Toothless in particular comes across almost immediately as likable and, in nature, resembles a puppy more than a ferocious dragon. In addition, the animation is very well-done throughout, and the flying scenes, especially one that recalls the \"A Whole New World\" magic carpet ride in Disney's Aladdin, are as realistic as any. I didn't find them quite as engrossing as those in Avatar, but I'm sure they would have benefited had I caught this movie in time to see it in 3D.\n\nStill, even with those pluses, it is difficult to overlook the movie's flaws. The plot is predictably predictable, which would not have been quite so bad if the secondary characters had not been reduced to mere stereotypes (the disapproving father who only wants what's best for his son, the overachieving girl who eventually falls for the hero despite herself, the bullies, the comical friend/sidekick/confidant). While the usual pop culture references are thankfully absent and there are a handful of sharp lines, much of the humor and dialogue feels tired and wooden; the mostly lackluster voice cast does little to help. Furthermore, the movie strives to explore Viking and Norse mythology, but despite occasional shout-outs to Odin and Thor, this is all largely rendered moot by the presence of Scottish accents when they are obviously supposed to reside in Scandinavia.\n\nIt's hard to really hate Dreamworks, though. After all, in terms of bug movies, I preferred Antz to A Bug's Life, and though I'm probably in a minority here, Kung Fu Panda was infinitely more enjoyable than Wall-E, which, for all its technical mastery, felt like an artsy message movie masquerading as something more accessible and less preachy. In spite of its faults, How to Train Your Dragon was a pleasant enough movie and certainly surpasses some of the other fare we've been subjected to thus far this year. It's no Toy Story 3, but it is something kids will probably love. Adults might not mind it much either."

I loved it. There was something about it that made it different, and better, than any other animation movie I have watched. It had something for all watchers.\n\nHiccup was innocent and yet had the \"hero\" characteristics in him just like any other movie would have (seeing as he is the main character). The dragons were bold, feared yet I wanted to reach out and pet them and possibly squeeze them with love - especially toothless.\n\nWhen the movie ended all I could say was \"I WANT A DRAGON\"."

Hiccup is a Viking teenager from the island of Berk. Unlike the tough, beefy men for whom fighting dragons is a way of life, Hiccup is lean and scrawny. He tries to live up to the community's expectations but fails miserably each time. His encounter with a dragon challenges him to see things from a different perspective and propels him to revolutionise his community.\n\nI find the premise - that human beings were wrong about the nature of dragons for centuries - not quite believable. To be fair, we have been wrong about many things in the course of history, but to be so wrong about a creature that you encounter on a very regular basis pushes the limits of believability. It just seems so silly that no one realised that the dragons could be tamed/trained except a naive teenager. This fundamental problem is what marred my enjoyment of a movie that otherwise had a lot of things going for it."

It's ACTUALLY a 3D film. The visuals are absolutely stunning and a definite must see in 3D.\n\nThe plot it self is so beautiful. It's not very predictable and being a teenager, this movie did get to me. This movie is enjoyable for both adults and young kids.

        "review_detailed_main": "Before I start, let me first say that I walked into the cinema to watch How To Train Your Dragon with no expectations at all. Dreamworks have been going downhill since Shrek 2 and the title of this film, coupled with a huge 3D printed next to it, failed to get my hopes up too much either. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this is Dreamworks best film since Shrek 2, but then I realised that Dreamworks haven't made a good animation since Shrek 2. Oh dear.\n\nAfter a fairly dull opening, we eventually get to the main story of the film which is about a young boy befriending a dragon which is meant to be the enemy of his people. In fact, it's a lot like Avatar in this regard. The boy in question is Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), son of the chieftain Stoick (Gerard Butler) of the island village Berk. Dragons attack said village and Hiccup manages to take down one known as Night-Fury. Rather than finish the job though, the boy befriends the dragon and is able to get to the top of his dragon training class ahead of his classmate Astrid (America Ferrera). Other classmates include Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Jonah Hill.\n\nAlready you can tell that the story is rather contrived and predictable with the only moment of true originality and laugh out loud hilarity coming in the opening scene in which dragons are burning down a village whilst Baruchel, Mintz-Plasse and Hill narrate over the top of it as if it's a perfectly normal thing to happen and they complain about their boring lives. Trust me, it will make all but the dullest of people laugh.\n\nIt's not just the script that feels a bit contrived though. The directors Chris Sandler and Dean Deblois previously worked on Lilo and Stitch and it clearly shows because the dragon may as well be Stitch. The Scottish accents throughout the film all sound like Mike Myers from Shrek except a million times worse. Just get some real Scotsman for God's sake, why is Jay Baruchel playing a Scottish kid!? Just so Dreamworks can have a big name on the poster, JUST GET A REAL BLOODY SCOTSMAN! Actually, give them some credit they did get Gerard Butler and David Tennant but I still don't get the obsession with big A-listers in animated films.\n\nThe moral message is also annoyingly unoriginal and so blatantly forced down the throat of the audience that I choked on my popcorn. How many times to kids need to learn the values of accepting outsiders and being nice to your father? The big surprise to me though was that the 3D was actually pretty damn good. The action sequences were also surprisingly well done for an animated film and these were (along with the funny opening I previously mentioned) easily the stand out moments from the film. It's definitely the best looking and most vibrant animation I've seen from Dreamworks.\n\nHow To Train Your Dragon is not a terrible film. It's funny in parts and looks great in 3D with some really excellent action sequences. However, it's so contrived and forgettable that I really don't think Pixar need to worry. They've still got the animation crown and Dreamworks are showing no signs of grabbing it away from them.\n\n2/5"

It is also a fun light movie that kids can enjoy. Alice in Wonderland may be a little dark for them. This has some scary/intense scenes with the dragons but it should be fine for the kids as most of the dragons appeal to them. DreamWork movies now are usually 3D and Pixar is following after it. I think DreamWork movies keep improving. I actually find this better than its last movie, Monsters Vs Aliens.\n\nThe story: Hiccup dreams to kill dragons like Vikings do. He is often ignored by his father when he says he wants to help kill dragons because of his \"weak\" size. When he finally caught a dragon, he gets closer to it and soon, he understands everything he wants to. The plot is straight forward, there is no twist to twist and turn the story. One thing that caught me while watching is the striking John Powell's score. He did an epic score for this which is another factor which contributes to the greatness of this movie. You got cool 3D effects, an enjoyable plot with humour and striking John Powell's score.\n\nOverall: It amazes me how much I enjoyed this movie. I never expected much from a DreamWork movie but instead this proves me wrong. I am surprised that this takes little time to dwell on the emotions of the characters and use the remaining time to make a funny action-packed movie. It is a good 3D movie for the kids if you think Tim's Alice In Wonderland is a little too dark."

It's a film I never get tired of.\n\nStraight into the action, forget build up, or scene setting, it takes minutes before this thing kicks into life, with vikings and dragons, it's so well paced.\n\nThe humour is glorious throughout, there are plenty of jokes for young and old, but it's the moving scenes that always get me, there are so many scenes that tug away at the heart strings, that scenes where boy and dragon first bond, it's wonderful.\n\nThe animation is simply amazing, and it's now 13 years old, yet it still looks wonderfully sharp. Hiccup is such a fun central character, and the designs of the dragons are exceptional.\n\nNo wonder this has such a high score, and appears every Christmas, it's just a lovely, fun, heart warming movie.\n\n9/10."

Set in the mythical world of Vikings and Dragons, tell the story of Hiccup who actually does n fit much with his tribe who are dragon slayers. His world changes wen he meets a dragon which ends up his tribe people to see everything in a different point of view. Dream-works did n disappoint us !!

I only found out a few days ago that this was based on a book, and while I haven't read it yet, I'm definitely going to. There are too many funny scenes to list, but I really love all the interactions with Toothless and Astrid. It's the little things like his eyebrows that get me.

To have two beings completely different from one another create an unlikely friendship is a nice idea, in this case the creators went really far with dragons. A mythical creature who kids can emphasize with.\n\nEach scene with Hiccup and Toothless the Night Fury are amusing and entertaining, among the best scenes in the movie that wrap up nicely the majority of the film, Hiccup and Toothless first flying around half time of the film is my favorite scene, it shows how both are a great duo together and how they've bonded perfectly throughout the story.\n\nAnother element I find remarkable is the parallel between the beginning and end of the film, how Toothless loses his left thin around the beginning of the film, and how in the epilog Hiccup loses part of his left foot. It may be a small touch, but it is very significant to parallel both the bond and loss of the two characters.\n\nAmong a lot of DreamWorks films many people and I grew up upon, I would say How To Train Your Dragon is my favorite, it is truly amazing, with a lot of emotion and humor built in. At the same time telling a tale of a otherly rare friendship."

The story is a huge ride, the animation is amazing and brings dragons to life, the characters are likable, the action is some of the most exciting, and the social commentary on taming an animal fits perfectly for a dragon movie. For those that love adventure movies, this is a must watch, especially for those that are highly interested in the legends or Dragons. We have seen a lot of dragon-related in film, but this is probably the most spot on. Not only would I consider this one of the best Dreamworks movies, but also one of the most epic animated films next to the Spider-Verse movies."

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't know. I saw only one trailer of the film before watching it. Maybe it was the low expectations. Well, given Dreamworks' stream of recent animated films (\"Shrek\", \"Madagascar\", but leave out \"Kung Fu Panda\" which was genuinely great) one could expect laughs but little substance.\n\nI am glad that my low expectations were blown away immensely. Not only is \"How To Train Your Dragon\" hilarious, it is also genuinely heartwarming, filled with gorgeous and beautiful animation, and topped off with easy-to-like characters (and dragons, to boot), and a very positive moral core to it.\n\nYes, it has it's fair share of clich\u00e9s and obtaining a somewhat predictable story, but it's mainly a family film, so they are excused. Yet, with all this in mind, I felt something when watching the movie. I don't know what it was, but it was the same feeling I felt when watching most Pixar films like last year's \"Up\" and especially \"WALL-E\". It was a wonderful feeling.\n\nI genuinely felt for the characters, they were very easy to like and to relate to. It was to my surprise that I knew almost all of the actors who starred in it but did not recognize them at certain parts. All of the voice actors are great, especially the lead Jay Baruchel. I also absolutely LOVED the main dragon Toothless even though it wasn't a talking animal, with it's realistic and humane emotions and its beautiful design. The animation was also beautifully rendered, and it is truly a sight to behold in 3D, with some scenes comparable to the 'Ikran' scenes from Avatar, if not better. It took me away from the real world and into the film's fantasy world. The film's moral message, that we should not judge things by its cover and thus act rashly towards it, is straightforwardly delivered. And finally John Powell's music score is sweeping and full of emotion in many moments.\n\nTherefore, \"How To Train Your Dragon\" will definitely get my approval for one of 2010's very best films, if not THE best so far. Let's hope not. However I have the urge to see the movie again as it felt like it was infinitely re-watchable. Parents should take their kids, children should see it with their friends, couples should see it together, everyone should see it. It is one of the best animated films to come out in a long time. And it definitely blows away all of Dreamworks' previous effort.\n\nBravo, Mr. DeBlois and Mr. Sanders. Congratulations for making another animated classic.\n\nOverall value: 9/10."

Their wings do not seem big enough to carry their own weight, much less that of a human rider. But a minor detail to be sure... Great movie. 3-D can help the graphics but even without it, I love it. Amazing family film that all can enjoy complete with slapstick and simple gags. It had better win some awards for awesomeness."

Whereas Pixar's worst films are still \"Very Good\", when Dreamworks films are bad, they are often atrocious. But now and again, they churn out a movie of utter brilliance, that I end up being floored with shock and elation. Films such as Antz (which in fact was better than Pixar's A Bugs Life IMHO), Monster House and Kung Fu Panda spring to mind.\n\nSo which category does How to Train Your dragon fit in? Well, since my review is very late on this board, amongst unanimously positive reviews, there will be no surprise in guessing that I put this in the utter brilliance category.\n\nFrom start to finish, this movie strikes a great balance of wit, action, drama, and character. This is high calibre entertainment with breathtaking visuals.\n\nThe protagonist is your usual, unlikely hero, voiced with almost Woody Allenish wit. Though sometimes the voice sounds a little too old for the young animated counterpart but thats a small niggle.\n\nThis is just quite simply tremendous animated entertainment, fast moving, thrilling and fun. The comedy is sophisticated, devoid of toilet humour, crass jokes. And absolutely no modern popcorn references which I generally hate, which even Pixar is sometimes guilty of.\n\nBoth kids and adults will love this. Out of Dreamworks output, I rate this above Shrek, on par with Kung Fu Panda and just behind Monster House and Antz."

Without giving anything away from the plot it is brilliant. for children it opens up a land of magic and wonder. For adults it is a breath taking experience full of love, struggle, and hardship that draws you in and never lets you go.\n\nThe characters in this movie were amazing and its what really made it come together. I actually cared about them and what happened to them. and became worried when any one of them were in Danger especially at the end. The love between the main character and his dragon is especially a wonderful experience you can feel the emotion the dragon and the main character have for each other. It made me go out and bring my dogs inside for the night. It also showcases the struggle families sometimes experience you can just see how badly the main character wants his father to be proud of him. And how much the father wishes to protect his son as well as relate to him. You can feel there care and love for each other even when things are at there worst. But it never goes overboard with love as so many movies do now a days it shows us that life can be a struggle and full of dangers and hardship but we are never alone and must never give up. The dialogue of the movie is spot on and I believed I would say the same thing in many of the situations the animation was perfect in all aspects.\n\nSound/Atmosphere Both are incredible the sound seems to be right on cue and is perfect from beginning to end it fits every single scene. The Surronding land is breath taking it filled me with ideas and really made me want to be there.\n\nBottom line This movie is a masterpiece and a must see. It helped me get over my writers block and gave me back the emotion I needed to continue my story and refueled my imagination. It is better then any animated film I have ever seen in my life as well as many non-animated films. I want to scream for a sequel but I think it would be better to leave this film be and let our imaginations make our own sequel. The only downside to this film is when it ended. Because I would give anything for it to be real."

I only intended to glance at this movie to see if it would be appropriate for my five-year-old. I ended up staying for the whole movie.\n\nDuring the flying scenes, with the perfectly-suited Galic music cheering us on in the background, I had tears of purest joy streaming down my face from the, raw, visceral emotion of it. I thought of Gerard Manley Hopkins and the Windhover: \"The dapple-dawn-drawn falcon in his riding .../.. High there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing In his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing\" Perfect movie making. I have to say, I've seen nothing like these scenes, and I cry at movies every, I dunno, twenty years or so?\n\nLet's be clear: this is an animated movie for kids. The story is straightforward, at the level that, yes, my five-year-old will understand. The music is very good. The story-animation is so well done that it just falls into the background as the story unfolds. It is not \"artful\" in the way of, say, Miyazaki, but it is still wildly creative and yields a magical world of ocean, rugged northern lands, and forest. The animation of the physics of flight and motion, and the details of emotional expression are exceptional. The voice actors are interesting, and without the sappy voices, and contrived humor we have found in some other recent animated movies. There is no pretense here of the movie trying to be something it is not. There are inconsistencies in the accents, and holes in the plot if you care to look. But, and this is the important but, the story, and especially the *experience* of this movie transcends both the genre and its shortcomings. Even if it is just for the highlights as one is soaring above ocean and earth on the back of a dragon, this is a movie for way more than just kids.\n\nAt the end of the movie, most everyone cheered, and half stood up and cheered, which I also have not seen before.\n\nI recommend this movie as genre art that is exceptionally well done, an uplifting evening's entertainment. You MUST see it in 3D! Yaaaaayyyy! Who-hoooh!"

Loosely based on a series of books by the same name HTTYD comes at you form the beginning and never lets up. Never a dull moment, never a wasted shot or scene the story progresses quickly but not so quick that you get lost. HTTYD harks at the magnificent novel, Eragon which was butchered into a film with the same name. Even if your not a huge dragon/fantasy fan you will be drawn into a story of a boy who fails at everything that is expected of him and knows it, a dragon who acts more like a giant cat, an over ambitious girl, and village full of steel-wielding vikings. The film is also hilarious and filled with one liners that have me laughing even now. The story is simple: a village of stubborn vikings battle dragons to survive until a misfit boy learns secret that could change everything. There are also heart felt moments, hilarious moments and the classic \"OH NO!\" and \"OH YEA!\" moments that are the back bone of any classic movie. This movie is, in some ways like the Incredibles but also in a class of its own. There are some moments that might scare younger viewers, a far amount of violence and some sexual references. I saw it with my family all seven of us, an age range form 45 to 6 and every one loved the movie.\n\nSo, go see it on the big screen! Don't wait for DVD and BR release GO NOW you won't regret it! If you can, pay the extra cash and see it in 3-D it worth it! This is the best movie of 2010 so far. GO NOW!"

Granted, this movie is kid-friendly, but it has enough substance in the story that it doesn't get weighed down with mind-altering attempts at comic relief. The story is enough without any inanities.\n\nHiccup is about as non-Viking as a Viking can be, and of course, his dad is the chief of the island, and the biggest, most Vikingest Viking that a Viking can be. He tries to use his skills to fit in and impress his dad, but his skills aren't physical. He's more of a thinker and a problem solver.\n\nWhen he befriends one of the most legendary dragons, which no one else has even seen, he begins to see into the nature of the dragons and how to deal with them. It isn't easy to convince the Vikings of this, but the circumstances of the story eventually take care of that problem.\n\nThe \"chemistry\" between Hiccup and the dragon Toothless is amazing considering that this is animation. All the characters are well-designed to bring out the characters, but Toothless is an impressive feat in his movements and his ability to convey emotions through expressions and body language throughout the movie.\n\nThe action in this movie is pretty eye-popping, but some of the more understated scenes are pretty striking in their own ways, such as the fight in the clouds when the Vikings are simply observing flashes of light. For a warrior people who venerate Thor and Odin, such a scene must have been dramatic in a different way.\n\nComic relief is here in the form of some of Hiccup's peers, and while they may have had more character in the book, they seem to be kind of sporadic in their scenes here. As a compliment, at last they aren't overused meddling goofups filling in for plot points with contrivances, as you might see in lesser movies. They definitely have character, even if it doesn't have a chance to show. The story stays focused and gets where it needs to be by the end.\n\nOverall, all the elements in this movie make it worth seeing. I'd even be up for a second viewing."

I hate to compare movies, but I have to use some reference here. Take Kung Fu Panda, perhaps the new gold standard in animation movies. Every characters was interesting in some way. They were all captivating.\n\nCompare to this movie. I was not enthused with the main character. He was so...plain. About the only really interesting character was the female viking. She was a bit clich\u00e9 (the tomboy thing,) but she held my attention more than the rest.\n\nThen there's the plot. The underlying moral of the story is fine. It's standard now, in these movies, for some happy moral to be expressed. This movie is no different. And I have no issues with it. But the plot is almost non existent. The movie drags. I think because his interaction with the dragon drags a bit. There's the dragon, the training, the conflict with father, and the final scenes (where something finally happens.) That's about it.\n\nNow the last 15 minutes...great, impressive, inspiring. So 7/10 for the last 15 minutes. Pull out all the stops here, I guess.\n\nSo by all means see this. And some people will enjoy more of the movie than I did.\n\nBut the ratings imply this is really good, over 8 out of 10. Very high for IMDb. I am not seeing it. Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, Robots, Cars, Finding Nemo ... all 8+. But not this movie."

Out of them all, this is my personal favorite.\n\nThis isn't just the best animated movie of all time, but I'd argue for a top 100 spot of all movies period.\n\nIt's imposible to have a perfect movie. You have so many elements that would need to be perfect in order to have a perfect movie: Perfect Characters, a Perfect Story, Perfect Acting, Perfect Editing, Perfect Music. You just can't have everything.\n\nBut this is a close as it gets for me.\n\nI think the greatest thing a movie can do, is leave an impact on its audience. After all, the aspects I just described are subjective. What constitutes a perfect story for someone could be lackluster for someone else. But what is not subjective, is the measurable impact that a movie has on a person.\n\nThis is a movie that was well received in 2010 (nearly 13 years ago now) when it came out, but that continues inspiring people to this day. It's still relevant to talk about its nearly perfect score and its masterclass on story writing. People still remember it as one of, if not the best movie DreamWorks has made. Children worldwide still want a pet dragon. Teens worldwide still wonder about its themes of purpose, identity, and change.\n\nI could write an essay on everything that makes this movie great, from the impeccable acting to the stunning visuals, but I think it's better to sum it up as the movie that has had the longest lasting impact on me since the moment I watched it as a kid.\n\nWhat more could you ask from a film?"

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched 'How to Train Your Dragon' recently after the hype began to build for the second film of the series. Having not seen the first, I decided to give it a go.\n\n'How to Train Your Dragon' starts off with us being introduced to Berk, a small Viking village that is constantly under attack by dragons. We're introduced to the protagonist Hiccup, as well as a few other key figures including Hiccup's father Stoic the Vast (the chief of the tribe) and Gobber, the one-legged one-handed Viking sidekick voiced by Craig Ferguson.\n\nThe first third of the story is fairly typical of many movies - Hiccup is not the strong dragon-fighting Viking like the rest of the village and he struggles to fit in. He is also looked down upon by his peers and his dream girl, Asterid. The characters are funny and interesting enough, however the movie really takes off when Hiccup meets Toothless, a dragon which no one has seen before (called a Night Fury) and which Hiccup shot down during the most recent battle.\n\nOnce Hiccup meets Toothless the dragon this movie literally takes off. Where you would normally expect comedy and light-heartedness from an animated movie, you are bombarded with themes of courage, loyalty and bravery. The middle of the film is particularly spectacular, with the animation and music being some of the best that you will see in an animated movie (and, if you enjoy movie scores, possibly ever).\n\nThe film's plot also has enough in it to keep you on the edge of your seat. While not totally unpredictable, the final third of the film delivers some excellent action adventure scenes, and right up until the very end of the film there are twists that will keep you entertained and emotionally attached to the characters.\n\nTypically I am a Disney lover - I used to watch the magical 2D movies back in the 90's and loved some (though not all) of Pixar's work in more recent times. However, after watching this movie I can confidently say that there are very few Disney efforts that can match this movie for sheer emotional beauty, something that has gone missing from many films in recent times, and has been replaced with formulaic comedy efforts. 'How to Train Your Dragon' is undoubtedly beautiful, it will steal your heart and leave you inspired by the end of it. The music is second to none and the characters ooze courage and heart - and the last thing worth mentioning is that the dragon designs (particularly their faces) are absolutely amazing - original and very creative.\n\nWatch this movie as an adult - I don't think a child will fully comprehend the emotion built into this film."

We won't tell you give you all the details because that's already been done in other reviews. Just let us say that we are already talking about going to see it again and also owning the movie as soon as it comes out! It was one of the best movies we've seen in years (and we watch a lot of movies)! The animation is absolutely stunning, but the story is even more wonderful, especially the story lines between the father and Hiccup and Hiccup and the dragons. But the whole story from beginning to end was fascinating and adults and children both will love this movie. We both cried happy tears at the end and still have not stopped talking about how fantastic it is and how much we loved it. We say RUN to your nearest theater to see How to Train a Dragon!"

The makers never took themselves seriously or lightly, they were somewhere in the in-between (:P) and that is where their victory lies.\n\nGetting down to the story\u0085 A Viking Tribe lives close to the seas and what do they have to worry about in their calm lives \u2013 DRAGONS. And the stubborn vikings fight, fight, fight but with no end result. And among these there is ,Hiccup, the only child of the chief of the tribe who is different. He is not strong as the others neither does he have good Viking skills. But one fine day he shoots down one dragon by luck. He traces it down and it is one of those dragons that is considered to be the most dangerous by the tribe. There are strict orders to kill it on sight. But the little kiddo never had it in him to do that. He cuts it loose and then the bondage starts between them. And the rest of the story is about how the kiddo and the dragon change the path of the lives and minds of the the tribe.\n\nThis is by far, the best movie of the year. The animation is stunning. Some of the wide angle shots and sweep shots are brilliant and the detail is also amazing. Action sequences are another treat. It is a goose-bumping experience. And the story is also good as it tugs at the strings right at the bottom of the heart. And there is lot to laugh as well. Brilliant one-liners that go well with the movie. \"Death by the Dragon, is an occupational hazard here\"\u0085.something on that line.\n\nThe voices by Jay Baruchel and Jonal Hill were good. And believe me, some scenes brought me to tears, some scenes had me jumping out of seat out of excitement. No wonder, the animation won the Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award. And Pixar can learn some valuable lessons from this animation.\n\nAll in all, this is great and a must watch.\n\n9/10"

So cute, in fact, that Toothless (a pitch-dark dragon called a Night Furie), the dragon our hapless (and unfortunately named) hero Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) befriends, reminded me of a cat I used to own (she was also pitch-dark, with a spot of white on her neck). Huh? Since when do dragons act like domesticated housecats when you get to know them? Ah, jeez. I suppose such questions are best left unpondered, since \"How to Train Your Dragon\" blends humor, pathos, and sometimes heart-melting tenderness with such grace and style that it had me shedding a tear or two by its conclusion. At its core, this is yet another allegory about not judging others by their differences, choosing your own path in life, and Doing The Right Thing (regardless of what others may think). The story is supported by colorful characters (dragon-killing vikings and their children), sharp writing that is by turns funny and truthful, and a fully fleshed-out world (including landscapes and a variety of colorful dragons that blend traits of both mammals and reptiles). The film is being marketed to capitalize on its 3D (which, admittedly, adds a few extra thrills to some scenes), but unlike \"Alice in Wonderland\" (so sorely lacking in pathos, style, and humor), \"Dragon\" is so strong on its own merits that the effect enhances the existing story, rather than becoming the sole reason for viewing."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"How to Train your Dragon\" is the latest digital animation movie from DreamWorks Animation studios (the same studio that produced the Shrek movies, \"Kung Fu Panda,\" and \"Bee Movie\"). The movie starts off with the narration of the main character, Hiccup (his name is explained in the movie), voiced by Jay Baruchel, describing his Viking hometown and the problems they have with dragons. The audience is thrust into an elaborate action sequence of dragons attacking Hiccup's village. This opening scene does justice to the advancements in digital animation and explores some inventive camera shots of the action and its characters.\n\nYoung Hiccup wants to be a dragon fighter and have the chance to kill his first dragon. Why does he want to kill a dragon? It means he will be respected among his fellow Vikings. He has one big size issue though, considering the average Viking is four times his size, no one takes him seriously. Villagers ridicule his size often. He resorts to using his intelligence to solve his problems (it seems that for such a young mind he knows quite a bit about aerodynamic engineering). One of his inventions takes down a dreaded night fury dragon. Yet no one believes Hiccup is worthy of being a dragon slayer.\n\nThe movie moves along smoothly with more being revealed about Hiccup and his situation. Turns out the head of village is also his dad, Stoick, voiced by Gerard Butler. Here is the setup of the traditional kids' movie story line where the child tries to prove himself to his father and/or mother. And yes, we have seen it before and the story is pretty formulaic, but this story does have emotion and well-written dialogue to keep the audience's interest.\n\nHiccup ventures into the woods to find and slay the dragon he had taken down earlier only to find that he cannot kill the dragon. He eventually befriends the beast and learns the traits of the dragon species. There is a humorous and touching development between the boy and the dragon. Toothless (that's Hiccup's name for the new friend) has mood swings from a Clint Eastwood toughness to a Bambie-like curiosity and friendliness. The directors, Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders (both of \"Mulan\" and \"Lilo and Stitch\" fame), put it together to make this friendship work so it doesn't come off too cheesy.\n\nStoick eventually enrolls Hiccup into a dragon slaying class in the village. In the class, fellow village adolescents learn the proper Viking way to kill different varieties of dragons. What develops is the conflict within Hiccup \u2013 should he kill the dragons or should he befriend them? The imagery of the movie is outstanding. The art directors took their time and added the details in the background shots. The water and the fire caught my attention because those elements looked real. I also noticed the hair of the characters (I know I am nitpicking, but in a good way). Considering the era and primitive ways of the Vikings, I could see that their hair was chopped off with a knife. The villagers obviously didn't have a village barber shop. They simply cut their hair with what was available to them. It's a small detail I know, but little things like that made the movie feel realistic.\n\nShould you see this movie? Yes, it's a good kid's movie with only a few hidden adult jokes. The action will keep it together and hold your interest until the end. The kids will like the different varieties of dragons and most likely relate to one of the adolescent characters. To paraphrase my 10-year-old daughter \u2014 it is a good family story that is funny and yet scary at times (she was referring to the action sequences, but in a good way). One more thing, I saw the movie in 2D and I still feel it was great. Try seeing it in its 3D format; it almost has to be better."

        "review_detailed_main": "The basic story is that a young Viking, from the North on the Island of Berk, who was keen on hunting trolls, gets his opportunity at an elusive dragon. When he confronts his Viking ways, he must decide for himself whether to dispatch his prey or will he come to an understanding of the true nature of the beast. If you own cats you can see the dilemma and the conflict. Not that any feline is in danger of being dispatched.\n\nThere is nothing unique about this movie. The story is old as the hills. The animation while not intrusive to the message is not unique either. There are no new truths or insights or anything. The standard minus and a boy are coming of age with others attempting to do so also. It is refreshing to find the single-family parent is the father however it is the old single-parent family conflict. The one big flaw in the story is that the only dragon that could use befriending was targeted for dispatching by everyone including fellow dragons; what kind of message does that send? I have to admit I did not read the book so I cannot compare the book/movie.\n\nOn the positive side, they picked some good voices (see the DVD extras) for the individual characters. They did not constantly bombard the movie with unrelated background music. There attempt at cute contemporary dialog works pretty well. The dialog was not dummed down as most of the later Disney movies.\n\nFor the technically inclined, I watched the Blu-ray version but not the 3D. Nothing against 3D, I just do have a fancy TV yet. The disk ran well in the Sony player. I did not try it in my other players."

I can't really talk too much about it because I would just rambling to the point of ad nauseum, so I'll be brief.\n\nThe story, about a teenager who downs and befriends a rare and intelligent dragon, and the trials they subsequently face is perfectly paced and written. There is never a dull moment and each scene is shot beautifully and well lit. It builds in seriousness up till the ending, which is among the best in a \"kids film\" in many years.\n\nThe animation is quite impressive and seeing this in 3-D and Imax is the truly best way to see this film. The flying scenes are breathtaking and will have you begging for more. each character moves and reacts to duologue and action like a real person and becomes much more relatable as a result. (Or as relatable as dragon fighting Vikings can be.\n\nThe characters are not only effectively fleshed out but are very relatable as mentioned above. While some of the side characters are more so stock personalities, they are still of hearty stock and nonetheless enjoyable. The characters are also voiced perfectly, I can think of nobody else to replace any of them and do a more effective job.\n\nThe Music. The score alone could tell this story perfectly, and it should have won the Oscar instead of \"The Social Network\". Without question. John Powell creates a mesmerizing score that brings you across the islands of the Northern Waters amidst the flow of strings, the roar of bagpipes, and pounding percussion that highlights this score. It is one of my all time favorite film scores and among the best for an animated film.\n\nReally, do you have any reason not to watch it? It's an hour and half of indescribable perfection that will leave you breathless. See it. Now. Are you still reading this? What are you waiting for? Watch it!"

I was always in love with Dragons such as Charizard and Blue-eyes-White Dragon when I was little so when I saw the poster I wanted to watch the movie straight away.\n\nNow let's start the review.\n\nThe movie is about a boy named Hiccup who lives on the isle known as Berk. Not the strongest boy of all but surely is the smarters.\n\nOur fellow young hero of Viking is queer he thinks he will be more popular by killing a dragon which alternately leading him meeting the Dragon, the night fury known as Toothless.\n\nThe animation is beautiful, the soundtrack my God the song \"Test Drive\" sends goosebumps down your skin while it's playing and that is what I remember when I saw the movie in the theatre the extremely beautiful soundtracks of this movie.\n\nThis movie is amazing and is watchable for all ages."

And if I should boil the review down to one word I would choose this word: Success! If you - like me - worship \"Madagascar\" and \"Shrek\" this movie is a must.\n\nBut... \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is unfortunately too focused on the 3D-effects, so some of the other elements of the movie is not as well- made as they could've been. But, I guess it's unavoidable as these effects are so \"new\" (of course not new, but you know what I mean). The creators are so excited about this new level of storytelling that they focus too much on this part and leave others behind.\n\nThe story is classic, and not as funny as some of Dreamworks previous movies. It works fine, but it still pulls down my vote since it only functions as a frame instead of the center of the movie. But having said that I need to tell you: \"How to Train Your Dragon\" will still be worth watching.\n\nMy youngest sibling doesn't understand English, so I won't be able to tell you about the Voice-acting for the original language, but if any Danes wanna know, the Danish-dubbed voices works good (Compared to other dubbed movies). The main character's voice is a bit weird, but won't disturb you.\n\nThe animations are done in the classic Dreamworks-style. It works nicely, since the caricature-like faces works good to express feelings. Summed up this movie is a must for any sane family. If you're going to watch it remember to enjoy the little bits, cause that is what's in focus."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rubbish title. Let's just get that out the way right now. It sounds like a working title that no one ever bothered changing.\n\nDreamworks Animation Studio hardly provide intellectual competition for Pixar, but with the Shrek and Madagascar franchises, they certainly give kids a lot of what they want. With its comparatively sullen hues and a largely bodily function-free range of jokes, How to Train Your Dragon is likely to appeal to slightly older children. Not teenagers, but the bright brand of tweens who'll drool over the scene in which our bumbling hero, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), scans through a Book of Dragons, which acts like a kind of Dark Age movie merchandise catalogue.\n\nThere's nothing drastically wrong with re-imagining the Vikings as victims defending their villages. But perhaps the film's closing pacifist sentiment comes across as a little disingenuous, given how much fun we've had watching arena battles and hundred-foot reptiles tear down mountains. I mean, after 90 minutes of rucking, will a child really want to put aside their plastic axe? Heavens no (or, indeed, Valhalla no) \u2013 he'll collect the toys, with their meticulously-moulded beards and scales, and play Dragon Massacre at Viking Village.\n\nBut an enjoyable adventure nonetheless. The cast is excellent, once you get over the fact that the 28 year-old Baruchel sounds exactly what he is, which is fifteen years too old. And the 3D is dynamic and arresting without being distractingly self-referential."

Even the TV shows that followed the movies are amazing and impressive. Dreamwork's clearly doesn't let down on their animation or their story-line. Lovers of Animation and Fantasy will definitely enjoy this movie. The start of an awesome trilogy and a line of epic TV series. But if you're a parent and have tiny kids maybe this is to big for them, you'll have to check and decide for yourself. In my mind its fine, but i'm not you. Clearly taking an idea from the well known Dogs is man best friend, Dreamwork's decided to take that but make that boy a viking and that dog a Dragon. The story of how Hiccup, a young not burly viking who doesn't seem to fit in anywhere in his Clan. Everything he seems to do is a mistake but he tries hard to help his Clan and take down the ferocious Night Fury; a dragon that no one has ever seen but torments them along with all the rest. Hiccup uses his mind to fire at the Night Fury and take it down... later on when he goes to find it, he's unable to finish the job.\n\nInstead he learns how to tame this not so Furious, Night Fury. Which luckily in this film is a dog compared to what a real dragon might act, Smaug per say. Learning how to tame this Dragon, Hiccup finds that Dog is mans best friend. And takes down a much more deadly beast."

A rating does not get 10 from me unless it has a brilliant story and compelling characters.\n\nThere is so much that can be gleaned from this film by little children to adults. The themes are difficult ones to handle but done very well: not fitting in, being cut from a different cloth from those around you, being brave enough to form unorthodox friendships (a viking and a dragon), and being physically handicapped (the protagonist, teen Hiccup, ends up physically handicapped at the end). Dreamworks took care with their product. I read later that they shows preliminary screenings to test audiences of families who recommended Dreamworks keep the ending the way it was, with the handicap.\n\nBoth the protagonist Hiccup and his father Stoic are role models who are very relatable. They may not make the best decisions but their hearts are in the right place. Hiccup is uniquely selfless and curious, even toward ferocious beats the people, the vikings, should be mortal enemies toward. The female hero and one of Hiccup's classmates is called Astrid. She is the \"son\" Stoic wants Hiccup to be, her having the makings of a true viking warrior in skill and mindset. Very unique, this film. She ends up being a large part of Hiccup's motivation for him to make the difficult and right decision as she and the rest of the classmates give their support and join him risking their own lives as well to protect Berk (their village) during battle, saving both the people and the dragons.\n\nIt could have been a bit tidier in story and plot. Some deleted scenes would have explained the motivations behind everything that much more brilliantly. However, it's still a 10 for me."

Im going out on a limb here and saying that Toothless is my favourite movie dragon in the history of cinema. Move over smug, this dragon is bad ass and scary one minute and then adorable as a domestic cat the next. Surprisingly, Toothless is the character i connected with most in the film because of my experience as a pet owner. Anyone with a dog or cat (or other pets i suppose) will love Toothless as he is so adorable as well as being loyal to hiccup. You cannot watch this movie without smiling, laughing and sometimes even on the brink of tears. If you are a movie fan, you need to watch this movie. I hope the sequel is just as good."

The plot follows a rather straight line without excessive complications, everything is quite predictable from the beginning. There are no major flaws, but the unpretentiousness of the plot and the simplicity of the characters makes the viewing tedious for adults. That's exactly why the \"coming-of-age\" of the village thanks to a young, underestimated protagonist feels a little too fast and sudden. The clash between the two factions is solved a bit too easily with the introduction of a third enemy, bigger and scarier, but unlikely. Without going into the details (the relationship between the dragons and the giant dragon is never explained), the death of the giant dragon is too easy, considering how frightening it was for the other creatures. The relationship between the protagonist and the father and the one between the protagonist and the blonde girl could benefit from a more detailed and credible development. The finish is perfect to make a very young audience happy, but objectively it feels too simple and forced. As for the animation, nothing exceptional, but nice enough to look at. There is no doubt that all this simplicity, which reduces the pleasure for adults, makes this film very suitable and enjoyable for children."

        "review_detailed_main": "While the plot arc is nothing original and quite predictable, the setting is an uncommon one and there are great moments, mostly in the third act. Many of the plot details seemed forced and lacking in depth. For example, the ease with which Hiccup made dragons who have been trapped and spent years fighting humans just surrender seemed unrealistic. Minor points, like the lack of clarity with whether or not Hiccup needed to be there to help him fly, or how they got Toothless to guide them, were not well explained. The relationship with the girl was quite token and predictable. However, I did really like the theme of confirmation bias and assuming other groups are enemies. The soundtrack is very good, and the climax is fun, if (like many parts of the movie) people acquiesce in a way that's convenient to the plot despite being contrary to who they seemed to be before. All in all, it's a good, fun family movie, but to me it didn't live up to the hype."

I am sure that everybody would be impressed with the perfectness of everything, and I would give extra compliments to the graphics being so fine and realistic making me live inside the movie rather than just watch. Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders are a good example of how a teamwork should be. I would like to see a movie like this everyday, and can't wait to see the next movie for each of those directors. I am sure that this movie can turn to a successful series. The only thing I didn't much like is the time of the movie being so short compared to the number of elements that should have taken their time to be well seeded, but this maybe a budget issue, and nobody can blame anybody when production runs out of funds"

Why, oh why would they choose to make the adult Vikings have a fairly broad Scottish accent, while the offsprings had a N. American accent. Look, if they wanted to make no effort to get the accent sounding somewhat right, then just make all of them have a N. American accent. But Scottish just makes no sense at all!!! They had Denmark, Sweden or Norway to choose from but they didn't bother? Or was it just that any old accent from Europe would do? Lazy!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "How To Train Your Dragon is the latest offering Dreamworks has released but could this be as big or as bold as Shrek? The story is very imaginative and is guaranteed to keep the attention of children and adults. The characters were lovable and the dragons were simply adorable, especially Toothless. The animation was marvellous and doesn't disappoint in quality which was to be expected from Dreamworks. The script is very cleverly written like everything else in the movie. Great characters, good music, brilliant animation and fantastic humour, this doesn't disappoint.\n\nI simply fell in love with this movie. I loved Shrek and Kung Fu Panda but this beats them in my opinion. The animation was simply crafted beautifully and you could tell that a lot of time and effort had gone into it and is probably the best animation I've seen for years in a kids' movie. I also liked how the dragons didn't talk, I thought it added a sense of reality to the movie (even if there is dragons in it). This doesn't mean Toothless, the main dragon, is boring, far from it. Toothless and Hiccup was fantastic as their trust and friendship made for heart-felt viewing and some funny scenes. The best scenes, in my opinion, was the flying scenes with Toothless and Hiccup, the animation during them scenes were phenomenal to watch. The characters were great as well and Hiccup's crush Astrid was great as she tries to figure out what Hiccup is up to.\n\nOverall, the movie had fantastic scenes, beautiful animation, great characters, voice acting, script and story\u0085what more could you possibly want from an animation? I highly recommend everyone to watch this, this is one not to miss!\n\nRead more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "This was a pretty good animated movie. I really liked the dragons as there are several different kinds that are designed uniquely and are colorful. It's about a Viking boy, Hiccup, that befriends a dragon. The dragon has injured its tail and can't fly out of this valley. Hiccup makes a device to go on the tail that aids the dragon in flying and he also makes himself a saddle. Now he's flying on the dragon and learning that the beliefs about dragons being evil are not true. He's also in dragon killing training school with some other kids. He starts to dominate because he knows what they like and can make them act like pets. Of course hid dad finds out and wants to slay more dragons. Can Hiccup and his friends stop them and save the day? It's a kids film, what do you think.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: Cute movie with cool animated dragons, worth a viewing"

        "review_detailed_main": "When i first saw this film at the cinema i thought it had no heart and was quite shallow. The thing that annoyed me was that this son of the chief spoke in an American accent when everyone else (apart from some teens) spoke in a Scottish accent, they all should have had one type of accent. But after watching it a second time i saw the heart of the story and the emotion between Toothless and Hiccup. It is very uplifting and so enjoyable to watch. I live Toothless, he's just plain cool and cute, i want a dragon like that one!!! But i think the journey Hiccup takes is extraordinary and its great to see how he grows in confidence but still remains the down to earth kid that we see at the beginning and he doesn't loose that quality through the film. It had humorous moments in with some of the characters which kept the spirit up in this film. The ending is very uplifting and i wonder how they are going to follow on with a sequel which is planned to be released in 2013. The CGI is amazing, it's so polished and modern and it feels fresh. I do think that if you don't like this film at first, at least watch it again and you'll love it soon enough, i'm sure of it. DreamWorks have hit a goldmine with this one."

        "review_detailed_main": "First off, I am in the animation industry. I can say without a doubt, this is one of the better films - not just animations - that I have ever seen. As far as animation goes, it's right next to Up in my opinion.\n\nI know that everyone who isn't a part of this industry associates animation with kids' movies, which is wrong on so many levels, but this is a great film for people of all ages. There's some kids' stuff in here, some adult stuff (come on, how many kids are going to get the DnD reference?) and a good message with an ending that's optimistic, but not just rainbows and kittens.\n\nVisually, this film is stunning, with Chris Saunders once again creating an amazing slew of characters. The designs are original, the story is unique, there's an adequate amount of humor, and a good message. The effects are fantastic - the hair simulations alone are breathtaking, and watching the muscles of the dragons is absolute eye candy for a character rigger like myself. The animation was excellent as well - there was maybe only one shot that was rushed, and the research that went into researching how the dragons, especially Toothless moved, definitely payed off.\n\nThe only thing at all that was off putting about this movie was the title, which only was kept because of the book it was based off of.\n\nI have to say Dreamworks, way to bring it up a notch. I could see this winning an Oscar if they finally beat Pixar. If anything, this masterpiece deserves it."

        "review_detailed_main": "I wasn't fortunate enough to watch this movie in 3D, though I wish that I had gotten around to doing it. I bet watching \"How to Train Your Dragon\" in 3D would be downright awesome. I sure enjoyed the movie tremendously in ordinary version.\n\nThis animated movie was, simply put, fantastic. Next to the \"Final Fantasy\" animated movies and the \"Resident Evil: Degeneration\" animated movie, \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is without a doubt the best animated movie I have seen in a long, long time.\n\nThe story told in \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is very likable and you immediately immerse yourself into the plot, because it is really such a good tale. Lots of adventure and warmth in the story, and it works so well.\n\nAnd the animation itself, wow! Simply fantastic. It looks so very good, lots of amazing details and very colorful. This is the way all animated movies should be, sparkling with colors and life.\n\nAnd the Night Fury dragon had so much character and personality, despite it didn't utter a single comprehensible word throughout the entire movie. I bet you will love him right away, I know I sure did.\n\nAs for the cast, well voice cast actually, lots of really good names here. I especially enjoyed Gerard Butler in this movie, he has a very good voice that is well suited for voice acting. But also among the impressive cast was America Ferrera, Jonah Hill, Kristen Wiig, and more. Lots of really nice voices to be found here.\n\nHowever, there is one downside to the movie, I am from Denmark, so the vikings are part of my heritage, and people here (and back then) didn't speak English with a Scottish accent. That, and that alone, was the only drawback of the movie. But it is a minor detail, and I looked past that. And as in going with the Scottish accent, why didn't Hiccup speak with that particular accent? And no offense to Jay Baruchel, but there is just something very annoying about his nasal voice. It just doesn't go well with me.\n\nBut moving on, \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is definitely a movie that you just have got to watch in any way you can. This movie is amazing, and that is the end of that! Thumb up, way, way up for this masterpiece. It has entertainment value for children and adults alike."

        "review_title": "Gives you that Pixar feeling.",
        "review_detailed_main": "The poorly titled animated adventure belies the simple boy meets dragon story as seen in trailers. This is a beautiful looking Viking epic, starting with an almost impossible opening sequence that juggles the introduction to all the characters, some jokes about viking life, all the while a huge dragon attack is taking place. As with any tentpole movie, effects or extravagant animated environments mean nothing if the story and characters aren't interesting. Here, our dragon trainer has a likable misfit nature that keeps the audience (both young and old) amused. That is one element usually missing in non-Pixar films. There are well formed characters throughout the ensemble, all of them showing personality and capable of generating good humour.\n\nI went to the 3D showing, and was not expecting much more than a cutesy tale of a boy training a dragon. To be sure the cutesy stuff is in there, certainly not shying away from giving dragons Disney-like big eyes and even purring like a kitten. What I was pleasantly amazed to find was that there is a lively Viking adventure that has a whimsical spirit. The Vikings come off as more than 2 dimensional, and the sweeping 3D shots give a great thrill ride around jagged cliffs. The central plot is a Vikings journey by boat to fight the dragons, and most of the obligatory love interest and bully subplots don't get in the way. Perhaps one could complain about plot holes in how a young kid disappears constantly without anybody connecting it with his new dragon training abilities. Several convenient plot points allow the story to whisk us along, wasting no moment on screen to move forward boy-trains-dragon, boy-meets-girl, and boy-rebels-against-society story arcs.\n\nIf you can keep the audience entertained, then you can pull off the magic act of suspending disbelief, something harder to do with adults watching this type of animated fare, then you have achieved that Pixar feeling. One of the very few animated films not made by Pixar that have done this.\n\n7 out of 10."

Shrek was most definitely my favourite Dramworks film, that is until i saw this. The vibrant colours and the stunning animation really captivated me and the music made the experience even more gratifying. Yes there were a few flaws, as their are with any film but this is most definitely as close to \"Pixar Perfection\" as Dreamworks will ever get. If your a fan of very funny, action packed, sort of emotion then go and see this film, i am serious drop what ever your doing now and get down to the cinema! It might not be as heart warming as Toy Story or as tear jerking as UP but it will most certainly give Pixar a run for its money in the action department. A most satisfying whole and this years best animated film, until Toy Story 3 that is!"

His father is the head of the village who are fighting Dragons who regularly come and plunder the village. Hiccup performs terribly during the Dragon attacks, but manages to score a lucky hit on the most fearsome Night Fury dragon which he sees land in a nearby jungle. He goes off to finish off the dragon the next day and gain some credibility within the village, but ends up befriending it.\n\nThe story moves on from here and is very enjoyable. It isn't too long and there isn't any baggy bits. Very enjoyable."

So often they seem to have a good story, an excellent script, cracking characterisation, and fabulous visuals.\n\nHow To Train Your Dragon is no exception.\n\nHiccup is the son of Viking chief Stoick, whose village is beset by dragons which steal the livestock. Hiccup is a disappointment to his father, especially when he doesn't take the same warlike approach to dragon-slaying classes as his contemporaries. But then Hiccup begins to be able to deal with the dragons better than the other youngsters, because he has secretly befriended an injured dragon.\n\nThis is an outcast story, dealing with a youngster who is alienated, but has the strength of character to stick to his guns in the face of pressure from all sides to conform. But it is also an exciting adventure story with a great deal of humour. The characters are engaging and well-drawn (in the dramatic sense, although they also look good).\n\nAnd the movie looks great. The locations are stunning, the animation is first rate, and 3D is very well used (focus pulls, in particular, work very well in 3D).\n\nAnd, more than anything else, there were big, big chunks of this film where it just got hold of me almost physically (and certainly emotionally) and took me on Hiccup's journey with him. Possibly a little intense for younger children, this is a great family film. I loved it."

I thought I would enjoy a nice 3d flick with my family, but instead I saw a so-so animated flick with so-so actors. I also thought that they could have put more detail into this movie. Compared to the last few 3D movies we've seen, such as Alice In Wonderland and Avatar. This movie is under par with them. So if you want to see an animated movie on 3d I suggest waiting for Toy Story 3 because this is the last time I'm going to be seeing a Dream works made film in 3d."

Casting could not have been better, complimenting the already well written plot.\n\nI was very impressed by the way the flight of the dragons was as would be expected and did not look fake. Taking into account gravity, wind and other factors. The wings bellowing with wind in them.\n\nOverall I would say that this movie is the one to see in 2010 and certainly the best I have seen for this year. Very easy for the whole family to enjoy.

        "review_title": "a good example of a formulaic family picture",
        "review_detailed_main": "I know a film meant for children (or a \"family\" movie so to speak) is working right when even as I can recognize where the whole plot will go, A to B to C to Z, when I think that if I were a child of 7, 8, 13 or whatever, I'd really love it. Perhaps I've moved on from being able to be really invigorated by these stories, where a nerdy outsider connects with another outsider in a society where their bond is sort of verboten. Hell, we probably have already seen this formula done, to one degree or another, in just the stable of Dreamworks animated films in the past years (shades of Kung-fu Panda spring to mind). But the good news is that the filmmakers give the characters some good life and circumstances, and the energy in the action and drama is high.\n\nBut what also makes it work is that a) when it needs to be funny, it's very funny (quips I didn't think could work won me over), and b) when it needs to, pun intended, the movie soars. Many will be immediately reminded of another movie filled with \"flying things\" from some months back, James Cameron's Avatar. While his film implemented cutting-edge 3D technology, I found seeing this film, in just the straight 2D, just as good if not, really, better in some ways. When it comes time to follow along with 'Toothless' the dragon and Hiccup as they piroutte through the sky, I was completely with it since I already was soaked up into this world. This isn't to denigrate Cameron's work inasmuch as to just make a point of comparison: it doesn't look quite as silly, oddly enough, by having dragons with this film as opposed to the whatever-the-hell prehistoric hybrids the Na'vi rode along.\n\nI digress though, the film is easy to see where it will go. The plot turns, the conflicts, the interest from the girl to the hero and the supporting characters, no convention is unturned. But the writing within the conventions are strong; the filmmakers understand how to work within them to bring out creativity in the artwork, in the action, in the connections with the characters, and when it comes time for the vikings to face off against the big baddie-dragon at the end (as we all can expect), it's exhilarating how the pace keeps picking up just when one expects for it to drop. And, ultimately, as repeated as the message might be, the under-current of \"peace and understanding\" vs \"FIGHT\" is a good message to send to the kids, with the most unlikely placement of vikings who pray to Odin and the dragons who fight against them (but as we learn in self-defense).\n\nThe voice-work is also uniformly interesting. I liked seeing Baruchel in this lead part, doing what he could with a nerdy hero; Gerard Butler shows why he should stick mostly to his original Scottish accent (it's also nice, by the way, to hear Craig Ferguson in a movie again; the actors playing the 'kids' all, oddly enough, don't have the Scottish twang, but still work well for what's required of their parts as sort of comic relief. And when it comes time to show the bond between Hiccup and the dragon, the writers don't jump to the quips: the dragons never speak, and all of the direction and attention can be found in their eyes and mouths and face contortions. It's really like the story of a boy and his dog or horse and in this, the heart of the picture, it surprised me with how well it worked. 7.5/10"

Though, some adults may actually find it enjoyable to watch. However, most children would and should like this film. The way the characters developed was nice to see. It was stupid and funny. There was a really strong bond between each and every character in the movie.\n\nThis bond got stronger over time, which was great to see!\n\nI definitely recommend this movie to children."

        "review_detailed_main": "In the Viking village of Berk, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), the young, idiotic son of the village chieftain Stoick (Gerard Butler), longs to follow in his father Stoick's (Gerard Butler) footsteps and become a famous dragon warrior. When their village is ambushed by dragons, Hiccup shoots down the most notorious dragon of all, known as Night Wing, who's penetrating scream is all that can be heard before a flash of light and the inevitable destruction. Of course, nobody believes him, and when he finds the wounded dragon, Hiccup realises he cannot bring himself to kill it. He instead invents a contraption that will help it's damaged wing, and after earning it's trust by bringing it food, begins to ride it. But while on a flight trying to impress his potential girlfriend Astrid (America Ferrera), the Night Wing is swept into the dragon nest, where an even bigger threat to the village is laying dormant.\n\nFor a Dreamworks animated effort, How To Train Your Dragon holds up refreshingly well when compared to the likes of Pixar, and to the rest of Dreamworks' rather shoddy past output. What works best is directors' Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois desire to keep things more grown up. This is a film more for the Lord of the Rings audience than those who somehow enjoyed the Shrek sequels and Madagascar (2005), with its execution rooted in fantasy and folklore. There are many different types of dragons in the film, each with a different 'power' and level of danger it brings with it, keeping the whole dragon mythology refreshing amidst a flurry of post-Rings fantasy efforts involving the giant fire- breathers. The opening battle scene is an explosion of action and comedy, an exciting way to discover the world these characters inhabit and witness Hiccup's ineptitude compared to his father's unrivalled prowess.\n\nThis being Dreamworks, it then decides to pander to the much younger audience, by introducing the (admittedly cute) Night Wing, whom Hiccup renames Toothless, and the younger inhabitants of the village (voiced by the likes of Jonah Hill and Christopher Mintz-Plasse). It was at this point where I asked myself why the elder villagers all have Scottish accents, while the younger ones sound pre-pubescent Americans in a mall. Obviously, it's a way of helping the younger (American) audience to relate to these characters, but to me it's just damn lazy and often quite annoying given Baruchel's weakling protagonist who sounds like only one ball has dropped. And with this comes the inevitable and familiar messages of acceptance and friendship. But ultimately, How to Train Your Dragon is a highly entertaining film, full of clever ideas, lovely, fluid aerial animation, and an exciting final battle with the giant dragon Red Death.\n\nwww.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "DreamWorks studios has raised the bar for themselves and have proved themselves to be a visual competitor of Pixar Animations with their new film, How to Train Your Dragon. This animated gem with the voice talents of Jay Baruchel, and a comedic cast ensemble of voices, is one of the dazzling adventures to blaze the screen this 2010.\n\nThe film tells the story of little Hiccup, a young, small Viking who has been long trying to prove himself as a fierce warrior to his huge in mass father and village. When he finally captures one of the world's most ferocious breed of dragons, young Hiccup discovers a world, no Viking could have ever imagined.\n\nThe screenplay by this five man and woman writing team is decent, though at times not as engaging as other CGI films that have ignited screens on fire for the past few years, it's an admirable step in the right direction for DreamWorks studios. It's leaps and bounds over last year's Monsters vs. Aliens, which wasn't half bad itself so I can appreciate the growth. The story is straight- forward, a bit predictable, and in its climax and bit heavy.\n\nAs many have stated just by looking at the preview for the film, the visual sequences with the dragons and flying are some of the most beautiful shots seen on screen this thus far. For the majority of the film, the viewer can find himself/herself in utter awe at the color schemes and stunning work shown.\n\n***/****"

        "review_detailed_main": "Dreamworks has been getting better, haven't they? Overall? They've certainly learned from Pixar that a little bit of heart goes a long way in animated children's film-making. Unfortunately, a little bit of heart is all you really get in their latest, the Norse coming of age comedy, \"How to Train Your Dragon.\"\n\nThe film is split into two tonally distinct sections: an intimate and charming boy-and-his- dragon friendship fable, and an exceptionally dull gladiatorial adventure film. It seems like nearly half of the running time is swallowed by a series of dragon defense training sequences with our hero, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), wowing a gaggle of cartoon stereotypes with his ability to tame the ferocious beasts without violence. There's seriously so many of these scenes that I keep thinking the name of the movie is \"How to Tame Your Dragon.\"\n\nThe arena stuff doesn't do much to carry the plot; it just sort of peripherally shows the practical application of learning the softer side of dragons. And because the plot isn't really being advanced (the young Vikings are being trained while most of their village is out searching for a dragon hive), gags substitute for story, and wit is not the film's strong suit. Honestly, most of the characters feel shamelessly yanked from an animated who's who of the last decade. You've got the bickering siblings from \"The Incredibles,\" a protagonist not unlike Linguine of \"Ratatouille\" fame, and a couple of Shreks thrown in for good measure (or maybe that's just the Scottish accent). The supporting cast ultimately dilutes the simple maturity of film's central friendship, and sucks \"Dragon\" dangerously near the \"Shark Tale\" sinkhole.\n\nIt's sort of like \"Up\" and the talking dogs. When you have something powerful, stick with it. Not every animated film has to be a 3D action/effects spectacle. Maybe this is a little greedy, but I'm not interested in going timeshare on \"How to Train Your Dragon.\" Give me \"Old Yeller\" or give me \"Beverly Hills Chihuahua.\"\n\nFortunately, it's more the former than the latter. As kids films go, you could do a lot worse, but the divide that makes Pixar Pixar and Dreamworks Dreamworks is still firmly inset in \"Dragon's\" design philosophy. Pixar transcends the idea of making children's films, where Dreamworks embraces it, and while that's terrific for the target demographic, I don't think mom and dad are going to have as good a time as they did watching \"Finding Nemo\" or \"Monster's Inc.\"\n\nBut Dreamworks is getting better at keeping the whole family entertained, and \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is among the very highest echelon of the studio's animated work, which probably partly accounts for its overwhelming praise via Rotten Tomatoes. Objectively however, it doesn't quite know who it's trying to please, and settles for a 'some of the people, some of the time' scenario that left me intermittently yawning. At its heart, there's a timeless companionship\u2014It just sometimes gets lost in favor of disposable entertainment.\n\nAnd that may be a backhanded complement, but it's a complement nonetheless. \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is entertaining and sometimes touching, but doesn't quite overcome its kiddie stigmata, and the ADD child in me has already moved on."

It's a typical kids movie therefore zero suspense and zero surprises. The Incredibles is ten times better than this yet it's nowhere in the IMDb top 250. Go figure."

Might see it again this week.\n\nBut Here are my 2 Problems I had with this film\n\n#1. Some people said this film \"Made the people from \"Avatar\" Jealous\",That was one of my main reasons why I saw this film. Heres my concern,Avatar was made by a Genius name \"James Cameron\" who directed \"The Terminator\"(1984) while LIVING in his truck, & How to Train your Dragon was made by this guy who Thinks \"Farts\" are funny for kids, because he directed Shrek,I can't remember his name but this is like his third film,I think. But here's my point of view,Saying That How To Train your Dragon is better than Avatar is like The Second coming of God(Jesus Christ himself) while EVERYONE has there attention of the new \"Justin Bieber\" album. Don't get me wrong I like both films, but I think its unfair for that matter.\n\n#2. I think I already seen the Storyline somewhere, I think it was one of the the Pixar or Dreamworks films, You know where the \"Weak\" guy is in this group & he's trying to be better for himself, he gets into a relationship, then a fight & then at the end he \"Magically\" comes out as a hero, I think that storyline has already been used once to many times, its not a major problem, but I just think its time to grow up & time to stop living in the past,Ya know.\n\nOverral I give this film a 7.7/10"

I don't even think you guys read the books. I do think the actors did a good job, but the books were nothing like this.\n\nThe dragons weren't hunted, they were befriended by the young viking BOYS. There weren't any girl vikings, they were in a different tribe. Toothless was small and green and the most \"common common or garden dragon\" and everybody teased him for being small and skinny. Oh, and Fishlegs was skinny and squinted and had asthma. Snotlout, unfortunately, was the one everybody liked. Oh, and Astrid didn't exist.\n\nI hope for the second movie, you actually glance at the book."

        "review_detailed_main": "When this first came out, I was in my 20s, and going through a hard time in my life. I was broke, my career and love life were disasters, and I was working long hours at dead-end jobs to afford my tiny, kitchen-less, prison-esque SRO in the big city. I had this tiny portable DVD player and probably the last Blockbuster video in NYC right around the corner. Thank God I rented \"How to Train You Dragon.\" This movie saved my freakin life. I must have watched it every other day for a whole year. Yes, I was a grown up with no kids in sight.\n\nIn terms of artistry, there's so much to say, but it's mostly been said. The story, characters, performances, score, and animation, especially of Toothless, are all extraordinarily. Frankly, the film makes the more venerated \"Toy Story\" franchise look like a pile of puke in comparison. I don't like the \"Toy Story\" movies much for a number of reasons, but that's for another review.\n\n\"HTTYD\" is way better. There isn't a single thing I would change about it. Except maybe the one tiny wrinkle when Hiccup and Astrid form too broad a conclusion about the dragons and their food in one scene. But this is a tiny quibble. Some criticize the storytelling as predictable, but I see it more as unfolding organically and in a manner that stays true to itself; the story has to be the way it is.\n\nHere's why this film saved me: having worried and despaired endlessly and fruitlessly in this period of my life, I realized that I could worry and despair, or I could just watch \"How to Train Your Dragon\" again, and doing the latter was generally healthier and more productive. It wasn't escapism so much as a kind of cognitive behavioral therapy that eventually helped heal some wounds. It made me feel less alone in the world. It made me want to make things and do things again. When I felt like a Hiccup in a world of Vikings, thinking of this film was a sweet balm that led me towards a sense of hope and faith in myself instead of spiraling into negativity.\n\nNow, many years and life improvements later, I still love it. But now I get to share it with my own kid and consider it more analytically, and I can trace a long upward trajectory in my own life back to the film. For one thing, once my finances and housing stabilized, I adopted a black dog. No, I didn't name her Toothless, but the film helped guide the way I thought about and trained her, and we mutually respected and saved each other much like Toothless and Hiccup. That was the beginning of many more good things.\n\nIn our squabbly, angry, egomaniacal, contentious world, where we fret about some things that matter but also so very many things that don't matter, \"HTTYD\" is a frickin beacon of light. Kids will probably like it too."

The music was nothing short of breathtaking in each film, and the animation was truly art. The world building was well done and fascinating and added on with every movie. And Hiccup is a definitely hero of the generation that grew up with these films.\n\nI might be the only one that picked up on this, but I noticed an analogy for foster pets. Yeah, Toothless was a wild animal and Hiccup was taming him, but when you hear stories of dog parents who rescued dogs from a traumatic environment, they all follow their own path of gaining trust with that animal. Rescue dogs require a lot of patience, training, and love for the dog to build trust with their owner so they can transcend species differences and become a proper family. Hiccup and Toothless went through a similar journey, and even if I'm the only one who interpreted it this way, I still appreciate it.\n\nEvery kids movie tries to share a life lesson to it's young audience, and HTTYD did it right. The moral of this story is to learn and accept others' differences. We see this with Hiccup and his relationships with his father, Astrid, and even Toothless and the rest of the dragon species. And along the way, Hiccup learned how to accept his own differences as well. Accepting and understanding others can help you learn about yourself, and vice versa. Be yourself."

It was missing the little side jokes and pop culture that is usually in kids movies now days. The voice acting was good with some new names\u0085but it mostly feels like a long Saturday morning cartoon, it is only about hour and half. The graphics were a little on the cheap side and the soundtrack felt low budget also.\n\nMy 8yr old liked it but my 10yr old found it OK. It is still a solid movie for family fun. My rating is based on the RE-watch-ability factor. Like the movie Robots, Space Chimps or Meet the Robinsons\u0085you know good but not great.\n\nWorth watching at a discount theater or buy it used."

It just didn't work for me at all. Something about the way the human characters were drawn just felt very off.\n\nThen there was the voice acting which for me was a bit hit and miss. I just could not connect with Jay Baruchel's performance at all. Something about it just completely threw me off.\n\nSo overall I did enjoy this film. Good story and brilliant soundtrack but I thought the design and execution was lacking in some places."

We went back to search for it but no luck, so I ended up buying another dragon just like it for the wing. He is now 16 yrs old. He gave me the dragon and I have it on my dresser!! Then they came out with Light Fury The Hidden World. We went to see it and again it was such a cute movie. Loved the ending! These movies are not just for kids. :)"

While I adore Studio Ghibli films I usually to stay away from American animation because it tends to be overly focused on entertaining little children with loud music, break-neck pacing, and formulaic writing with little thought given to story. I watch Disney and Pixar movies on occasion and end up enjoying them but I often find myself wishing for something a little deeper in the stories.\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon gave me similar vibes to Ghibli films. There's a young, sensitive boy who just doesn't have the heart to slay a dragon. The training sequences were amusing. The scenes of flying on dragon-back were breathtaking. There were several moments where I got teary-eyed and not even for reasons one would expect, such as the first time Hiccup touches Toothless. There was a surprising scene at the end of the movie that was much more mature than I expected so kudos to the studio for that.\n\nToothless is simply awesome. Actually all the dragons were nicely designed and animated but Toothless is amazing. I love the design of him, I love his puppy-like mannerisms. Hands-down one of the best animated creatures."

Father misunderstanding his son and wanting him to be an exact mirror image of himself but realizing through time , after a lot of hurt was exchanged , his son is even stronger , fiercer , more courageous and caring was heartwarming to watch. As the movie puts it ' Every bit the boar headed stubborn Viking you ever where! ' This deep and dramatic story makes this movie suitable for both adults and kids as I'm still enjoying it a decade later.\n\nOne of the prettiest animations I've seen with it's stunning flying sequences , breathtaking backgrounds and unique design of the night fury. Dark and beastly, at the same time , cute and lovable. Toothless terrifies me when he goes full beast mode and makes me smile whenever he does something playful and cute. Magnificent drawing.\n\nAnd the characters faces realistically changing , smiling and grimacing based on the tone of the scene , expressed their emotions in a very clear and humanly manner. All the subtle gestures and expressions the characters were making had a message to send. Incredible animating work.\n\nThe music score that matched with every scene , the humor that was entertaining to both kids and adults , the complexity of the characters and the well written script made me adore this movie since my first watch. A lovable movie I'll never get tired of."

        "review_detailed_main": "When my friend told me I had to watch this, my immediate response was \"I'll pass thanks\". I'm very glad she forced me into it anyway.\n\nI've heard people say that the plot was boring, clich\u00e9d and predictable. Okay so it was predictable, we all knew the kid and the Dragon were going to become friends. After all, it's called \"how to train your Dragon\" not \"how to eat your human\", but it was by no means boring. Clich\u00e9d? Well yes, the plot line isn't new (social reject becomes friends with the enemy, changes underlying social order and the world becomes a better place). We've all seen it before, but then again it is a kid's movie and no one ever condemns the classic fairy tales for having the same plot (mistreated girl escapes cruel mother figure, meets prince, lives happily ever after). The movie was captivating enough for its lack of originality to be forgiven.\n\nWhat was troubling about this movie however was not its lack of originality but the underlying message. The main idea behind this film is that we should accept those who are mean to us as opposed to killing them for stealing our sheep. That's all well and good, don't judge a book by its cover and all that, but what happens when you try to train your dragon and rather than being a loyal steed it bites your hand off and gives you a face full of flames? It is just a piece of lighthearted entertainment, but the idea that being nice to the bully will always make him go away is a flawed one at best.\n\nOther than that though, this movie was a vast deal better than I expected. The humour was great (I got a few giggles out of it anyway) and the animation spectacular. Not quite Wall-E spectacular, but certainly impressive in its own right. The characters were lovable and well voiced even though Vikings didn't really have Scottish accents. The relationship between the dragon and the Hero was very well developed and triumphantly heartwarming during the action packed climax.\n\nThe verdict therefore: a charming movie, not to be taken too seriously but ultimately very entertaining. You really do need to learn how to train your dragon."

The animation, music and story is amazing. Really. I normally don't give movies a 10/10, but I think I have to for this one, especially because of its special place in my heart. I remember when I first saw the scene of hiccup riding the dragon, I turned to my mom and said \"I want a dragon too!\". It's truly magical, and a must watch for any child or even adult. Or anyone in between or over. I highly recommend it if you have kids, or even if you just want to lay back and watch a movie."

For that matter, why do ANY of the Vikings have a Scottish accent? o_O And did *any* female Vikings *ever* leave their homes and hearths, or whatever? Also, how come the dragon knew so many human gestures when he'd barely spent any time around the main character, or any other human? He's gesturing with his head at the fish, indicating that the boy must eat it, and mimicking the act of swallowing. Really, watching this you'd think there was nothing but a language barrier between humans and reptilian creatures. This movie's just ... silly. Way too childish. If you're over the age of 10, go watch Shrek again instead."

If you like an animated movie with a wonderful story that delves into character development, then How to Train Your Dragon is for you. How to Train Your Dragon is the best family animated film I have seen in a long, long time. The characters are wonderfully written. We see the friendship between Hiccup (the main character) and Toothless (the dragon) develop through their awkwardness, fear of each other (at first) and their attempts to understand one another. We see the story of a young viking who does not fit in being able to use his other gifts to become a viable part of his society. The film is well written overall. It has some of the standards outcast type situations, but those are the things that make outcast movies so endearing. The film looks marvelous. How to Train Your Dragon uses the 3D element very well and creates a beautiful world for the story to grow within. Highly recommended."

I just watched it the whole way through and before I knew it I liked something. The 3-d animation was cartoony, but at some places I was at awe at some of the 3-d textures they put into this movie. The overall in general concept was very clich\u00e9 but how the concept was portrayed and the act in which they specifically tackled it, made it fresh and unique. If you are slightly or even considering watching this movie. I would say go ahead and watch it. The only way I can see how someone wouldn't like this is if they aren't into these movies or they have a grudge of some kind towards the making of it. Enjoy. 8/10"

Characterization was excellent by all the voice-actors and animators. But it was and is the story that really makes this movie worth the price of a theater ticket. As the story moves forward, Hiccup's growing friendship with Toothless along with the expectations of his tribe known really keeps a viewer on the edge of their seat wondering what will happen next.\n\nThe revelations in the film about the dragons pull at one's emotions. One theme that runs throughout the story is the concept of overcoming prejudice. Hiccup is perceived by everyone as \"the useless\" and the dragons as vicious beasts that the vikings should always \"kill on sight\". As the story progresses those perceptions change -- first the villager's perception of Hiccup and then the error of everything the viking's supposedly \"knew\" about their supposed enemies -- making it all look like foolishness in the end. And the resolution definitely makes you smile. The STORY is what really makes this movie."

        "review_title": "A disappointingly weak story, but an acceptable kids film",
        "review_detailed_main": "Went to see this with my kids, 8, 6 and 4. They loved the superb animation, the great variety of colourful dragons and the breathtaking flying sequences and all the fireballs, but they only understood the story at its simplest level - i.e. a rather sweet story about a sensitive teenage boy called Hiccup, a weak, \"underdog\" Viking, who befriends a dragon against the wishes of his father.\n\nThis film must come with two warnings (1) It is far below Shrek, Kung Fu Panda and other \"classic\" Dreamworks output. (2) Apart from the names of a few of the main characters, Hiccup's underdog rise, and the mythical location of the Viking island of Berk, the film bears little resemblance to the series of 8 brilliant Cressida Cowell books (which I highly recommend for readers aged 8-12).\n\nThere is an attempt at humour, but it is quite weak, mainly because the supporting characters are all incredibly flat (and its a double shame because the Cressida Cowell books are hilarious). Hiccup, his father Stoick and the dragon, Toothless, are well portrayed, though. Also missing is the sort of modern pop soundtrack and pace that made Shrek stand out. Indeed, the film has a very slow start, largely because there are just too many device seeds to sow in order to make the all-action climax work. Although the climax is a brilliant visual spectacle, it all feels rather forced - the feeling I got was that they went through so much trouble to set up the climax, but it still didn't make sense. And to top it all Hiccup has an unnecessary love interest, Astrid. She is great as a Viking girl character, but there was no need to force the romance between her and Hiccup - it added nothing to the story except for schmaltz - something we'd expect from Disney rather than Dreamworks.\n\nOverall, this has to be one of the weakest scripts Dreamworks has produced. It will keep the kids entertained for a couple of hours and its probably even worth getting on DVD, but its most definitely not a classic.\n\nAs a post script to the review, I'd also like to rant about all of the voice talents as well. Why does Hollywood think its okay to give Scottish accents to the adult Vikings? Do they not know that there is a difference between Vikings and Scots? And why, having given the adults Scottish accents, do they think that its okay for the teenagers (Hiccup, Astrid, etc) to have American accents? And if they're going to have American accents, why not have them voiced by teenagers, rather than by adults. Hiccup in particular I thought sounded far too much like the adult American that voiced him, nothing at all like a teenager, let alone a Viking one."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"How to Train Your Dragon\", or as I like to call it \"That Viking is out of my League\", is the second film in as many weeks where Jay Baruchel plays a scrawny nerd looking to find himself. It also happens to be infinitely more entertaining. He voices Hiccup, a hapless young Viking living in a village overrun by flying dragons. He longs to be like his great dragon-killing father, Stoick (Gerard Butler), and charm the likes of the beautiful Astrid (America Ferrara), with whom he is enrolled in dragon-battle training. While dragon-killing isn't for him, he soon finds a particular knack for dragon-whispering, subduing the beasts with his wits and even making a friend in one that he names Toothless. He soon realizes the reason for why the dragons are attacking and tries to convince dad that the winged creatures really aren't so bad afterall. Directors Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois have created a tremendous 3-D experience, setting the bar for animated 3-D much like \"Avatar\" set it for live-action. The dragon battles are thrilling and the flying scenes between Hiccup and Toothless soar with joy and pulse-pounding danger, and are magnified perfectly by John Powell's fantastic musical score. And at its heart this is a movie of friendship and learning to follow your own path, both movingly portrayed by Sanders and DeBlois' screenplay. The animation looks great, from the large, bushy-haired Vikings to the comically goofy looking dragons. The voice cast is also well-matched. Baruchel has a wheezy comic charm, Craig Ferguson gets the best lines as the village blacksmith, and who better to voice a Viking than Gerard Butler. \"Dragon\" is as heartfelt as it is impressive to look at, a family film perfect for all ages."

        "review_title": "A Must See in 3D!",
        "review_detailed_main": "Set in the mythical world of burly Vikings and wild dragons, and based on the book by Cressida Cowell, the film tells the story of Hiccup, a Viking teenager who doesn't exactly fit in with his tribe's longstanding tradition of heroic dragon slayers. Hiccup's world is turned upside down when he encounters a dragon that challenges he and his fellow Vikings to see the world from an entirely different point of view.\n\nRight off the bat, I have to say HTTYD is the first great movie of 2010, and it deserves the title rightfully so, despite of having a horrible and terribly inaccurate marketing campaign. Even a Pixar comparison wouldn't be a wrong thing to say. HTTYD is what all storytelling is about and then some. It's one of very few movies, with AVATAR, to use the 3D in such an amazing fashion to enhance the overall movie experience. In fact, not seeing this in 3D would be like having a BLT sandwich without the bacon, lettuce, AND tomatoes! It's not one of those films where the film was converted to 3D in hopes of getting more revenue from the consumers (I'm looking at you, CLASH OF THE TITANS and countless others!).\n\nOf all the Pixar films this can be compared to, WALL-E seems to be the most reasonable because of a character that does not say a single dialogue: Toothless. Toothless is one of those rare characters you see in films where you can understand his emotions and overall character just by his actions alone, and that's a pretty difficult thing to pull off, if I must say so myself. I also loved the father-son relationship explored in this film, which is very similar to that from CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS. The plot is pretty easy to understand but it's very complex underneath with the conflicting attitudes from the characters and the moral ambiguity, much like AVATAR.\n\nThe film also has a wondrously, appealing visual style. There are some moments in the film where the images placed on the screen are so emotionally resonate and brilliantly perfect that they teared me up. The directors, Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, seem to know what they're doing. The characters are also fantastic because they are authentic and very real. Jay Baruchel, America Ferrera, and Craig Ferguson impressed me the most. My favorite character is Toothless, who is cute and charming. Let's not forget about the action and comedic side of the film.\n\nUnlike most Dreamworks Animation picture, HTTYD does not rely on pop culture reference and toilet humor, which automatically puts the film on the heap of the group, right? The action sequences are also well done and visually stunning. On top of every positive thing I have to say about the film, I must not forget the unforgettable soundtrack, composed by the great John Powell. The score is not used as a backdrop but as an enhancer to heighten almost every scene. In fact, there is on flight sequence where the 3D technology and Powell's score mixed so well that the hairs on my neck stood up.\n\nIf there is one flaw the film has, it's the predictability, but I really don't count that as a flaw if a film executes it really well. Overall, HTTYD is a surprising delight filled with whimsical action, authentic characters, and near-brilliant storytelling, not to mention rendering the 3D technology to bloody awesome use. It's going to be one of the best films of this year. That's how confident I am. Watch this movie NOW."

When the disappointed father declares \"I have no son!\" It's genuinely painful and believable. The overall outcome takes a brave and mature turn, making it very authentic. For me, there was a bit too much dialogue. The best parts were the montage moments between Hiccup and Toothless, which reminded me of that quiet simplicity in Wall-E. This is highly entertaining stuff for the family and avoids being patronizing in any way. The ending is also extremely exciting, even by today's action obsessed world."

And let me tell you this film did not disappoint me in the least bit, the animation was beautiful, the story was great (not entirely original but that is forgivable) The characters were real and likable, and you just got sucked into this whole new world for the duration of the film. The film pushed CGI to its limits and the 3D worked really well during many of the scenes, especially the flying sequences. I need to talk about the score... One of the best I have heard from ANY movie! So good! This is definitely a new entry in my top ten favourite animated films, and it may be a little closer to the top than I ever anticipated.

The music and visuals are very impressive.\n\nIn regard to the books, the film discards the vast majority of the source material (from the first book alone), except for the cosmetic setting details, and names. It completely abandons the heart of the books, which was a very different dynamic between the main characters. Some characters are represented by name, in the animation, but are not recognizable; another is invented to fill a recycled plot requirement.\n\nI feel it would be more accurate to describe the movie as inspired by the books, as no real effort is made to adapt them directly, which is a real shame."

        "review_detailed_main": "'How To Train Your Dragon' is an average fare. Though most of the people loved it and made a super-hit , I personally believe, this animation flick lacks a solid script.\n\n'How To Train Your Dragon' is set in a mythical Viking world where a young Viking teenager aspires to follow his tribe's tradition of becoming a dragon slayer. After finally capturing his first dragon, and with his chance at finally gaining the tribe's acceptance, he finds that he no longer has the desire to kill it.\n\nThe idea is interesting, and the animation is heavenly. Where this flick falters, is it's writing, which is too predictable after a point. The final 40-minutes are been-there-seen-that, done-with-it stuff. It had the potential of becoming a terrific film, but for me, it came out as an average watch.\n\nThe characters are wonderfully voiced. Jay Baruchel in the lead role, brings in various emotions to his character, while Gerard Butler, voices wonderfully as the lead Viking.\n\nOn the whole, I have grown up watching Masterstorkes like 'The Lion King' and 'Beauty And The Beast' , I carry loads of expectations from Cartoon-Animated Cinema, and so why, I was disappointed by this one, thanks to the predictable script. Watch it if you must!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I shall start of by saying that this is my all-time favourite animated, and modern film, and my favourite overall (after The Matrix). If you go to this film expecting childish and simple, you'll be pleasantly surprised - although it originates from a short children's story, the film is incredibly far from this style. Suitable for all ages without being cringeworthy, and with a story that's closer to a humorous drama than a dramatic comedy, this film deviates from Dreamworks' usual style into something, in my personal opinion, much better; the visuals are breathtaking, the dragons are fantastic, the people are believable and the script is amazing. The most amazing part of the movie however, is the music; the tracks themselves are brilliant, and without their presence in the film, it would be lacking in so much emotion. Even more so amazing, is that the music amplifies the emotion in the film without being overly obvious - so much so that it took until the second watching before I realised that the 'forbidden friendship' scene was only as beautiful as it was because of the score. After I left the cinema, I felt so empty that I was drawn to see it again and again, something which no other film so far has done for me."

Vikings speak Scottish, children don't, weaponry and terminology centuries ahead of its time, and well... dragons. None of it makes sense. It doesn't even follow the book it's based on. But it works. It really does.\n\nAs previously said by others, Dreamworks Animation should see this production as their new \"true north\".

It is entertaining, funny and delicious to watch. The script is robust and original without being cheesy, the emotional drawing of the characters is powerful, the animation and color are great and very detailed (I was mesmerized by how real the hair of Hiccup looked and the wonderful design of the dragons), the action scenes are magic and marvelous (one feels that is really flying and in the spot, the scenes of training and learning truly delicious.\n\nThe humor is not as witty and naughty as in the Pixar movies, but this is a funny movie without being simplistic, and the viewer laughs and smiles easily, almost without wanting to.\n\nI loved the Scottish accent of the dwellers of the Viking village, but I was shocked by the broad American accent of Hiccup and other kids in town. I mean, the fact that they are younger and different doesn't turn a broad Scottish into an American accent by magic. A softer Scottish accent could have been better and more credible. But this is truly me being picky.\n\nI loved the movie. When the movie ended I wanted more, as I was in love with Hiccup and Toothless!"

        "review_detailed_main": "As I've said numerous times already, I'm not exactly DreamWorks Animation's biggest fan. I feel that, aside from Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and last year's Monsters vs Aliens, their films symbolize the worst of mainstream animation, focusing primarily on cringe-worthy pop-culture gags. What convinced me to buy a ticket for How to Train Your Dragon, then, was seeing that Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois \u2013 directors of Lilo and Stitch (one of the few rays of light in Disney Animation's \"dark age\") - would be at the helm. Oh, and that 97% on Rotten Tomatoes may've been a part of it, too, admittedly. Whatever the reason, I'm happy to say that Dragon not only surpasses the duo's previous effort, but is also my favorite film delivered by the studio.\n\nWhile the premise of How to Train Your Dragon may seem tenuously related to that of other films of its ilk, the way in which it's actually delivered makes the whole movie feel all its own. The two main characters, Hiccup (voiced surprisingly brilliantly by Jay Baruchel) and Toothless, are incredibly endearing, and their relationship is unfolded in such a way that's nothing short of tear-jerking. It looks like the folks at DreamWorks Animation have been taking lessons from Up and Wall-E, as the most beautiful moments of the entire film are those without dialogue.\n\nSpeaking of beauty, the use of 3D in Dragon is the most impressive I've seen in any animated film, and actually, rivals that of Avatar. Unlike, say, Alice in Wonderland, the film doesn't rely on the 3D clich\u00e9s of awkwardly bringing objects toward the screen. To put it simply, the 3D visuals enhance the story, rather than act as a substitute for one.\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon, while including an engaging, character-driven story, is an awe-inspiring theater experience. While the basic story may not be the most original, what these artists do with it make it extremely lovable. On top of that, the characters are particularly endearing, and the visuals are some of the most impressive that I've seen in any animated film. DreamWorks Animation, consider me a fan."

In a tense scene Hiccup decides not to kill the wounded shiny black axylotl-looking beast, and instead frees it.\n\nFrom this point on he swears off dragon killing.\n\nSo of course Hiccup gets home to find that his Dad, against his better judgment has enrolled him in the local dragon killing training session, held by none other than Gobber. There, alongside other similar aged, but far more brutal and bloodthirsty teens (in a PG 13 way of course), Hiccup is taught that dragons are to be feared, and when in a position to do so will ALWAYS go for the kill.\n\nHaving only recently finding this not to be the case Hiccup is skeptical, and decides he must find out exactly why his encounter didn't end with him gone and the dragon reaching for a toothpick.\n\nWith his Father and most of the village's adults away on a voyage to find the main dragon's lair and eradicate the menace, Hiccup consults the good old \"Encyclopedia of Dragons\", only he can't find one which describes \"his\", and it seems that the only way to deal with such beasts is continually \"kill on sight\".\n\nSo Hiccup goes back to his dragon, who for some reason he has named Toothless despite clear evidence to the contrary, and he identifies that without fixing the dragon's tail, he is a sitting duck, so to speak.\n\nThere are some really good scenes with Hiccup and Toothless getting to know and become comfortable with each other, (and thankfully the dragon doesn't talk and spout catchphrases), and the early flight sequences are really cool.\n\nAlso back at the village Hiccup is able to use some of his \"pet\" knowledge to subdue the ferocious beasts used for training purposes, and with his new skills he becomes a local celeb \"Dragon Whisperer\", and ultimately wins the \"Class of 1256 Dragon Slayer of the year\" award, which gives him the privilege of killing an actual dragon in front of the whole village.\n\nThings get more complicated when love interest Astrid discovers his secret, and more complicated still once his Father realizes that he can use Hiccup's knowledge to track down the big Daddy dragon.\n\nSo Hiccup must decide if he is a dragon killer, or to go public with his knowledge that dragons can be quite harmless and tame.\n\nWhat might he choose? Hint; this is still a PG film.\n\nFinal Rating \u2013 7 / 10. Definitely more intense than most animated films, I think 11 + will get a lot out of this. (15 + will watch Kick-Ass.)\n\nIf you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "Wooh, well I just got back from seeing \"How to Train Your Dragon\" in theatres. I won't make this a very long review 'cause I don't want to bore you people to death with my blabberings.\n\nPlot: Very decent. A nice detour from the usual \"follow your heart/destiny/calling\" sort of films. This time the plot is a little more heart-felt than that. It revolves around the relationship of the protagonist and his father.\n\nMusic: Honestly, I was too engrossed in the plot to pay much attention to the music..but from what I remember, it was excellent :) Cons: there were a few clich\u00e9's in the movie..but that's to be expected. The movie also did not have too many \"hilarious\" moments. A few laughs were had..but this is more of a drama than a comedy.\n\nOverall impression: This movie was quite satisfying. After going to see \"Alice in Wonderland\" in theatres, I was a little skeptical of going to see this one. It surprised me though..it threw things at me that I wasn't expecting.\n\nRecommended to: I would say..pretty much any kid is going to like this movie, unless they frighten really easily. Older kids and adults may have trouble connecting with this movie, but since I like children's movies, I liked it fine( I'm 19 yrs old).\n\nThis movie was funny, touching, suspenseful, and action packed. Go see it while it's still in theatres! I didn't go to it in 3D, but the regular seemed great even without the 3D. So, if you're on a tighter budget, don't bother with the 3D showing."

        "review_detailed_main": "The right combination of an appropriately awkward protagonist, a clever script with not a single pop culture reference, and truly remarkable animation (including 3-d flying scenes that trump anything in Avatar), made this flick a blast from start to finish.\n\nA group of Scottish(??) Vikings live on a small island, stubbornly rebuilding their wooden homes after they are burned to the ground by the islands other inhabitants: dragons of myriad shapes and sizes that steal their sheep and raze their village. Over and over again. Beefcake adults with proved mettle act as dragon slayers, fighting off the scourge. The young, gangly Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) aspires, in his way, to join their ranks and prove himself to his father and Chief, Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler). Short of brawn but heavy on brains, Hiccup invents a catapult type device, which he uses to bring down the legendary Night Fury, a dragon so notoriously fast and deadly that they've never even been seen with the naked eye.\n\nWhen he finds the fallen dragon, injured and helpless in the tangles of his trap, Hiccup cannot bring himself to slay it and instead sets it free, thus starting one of the most endearing \"boy and his pet\" relationships in movie history. That night, two hearts change - Hiccup decides he doesn't want to become a slayer, while Stoick decides Hiccup deserves a chance. His father's will too strong, Hiccup reluctantly begins slayer training, where he will learn to bring down - and kill - the beasts.\n\nThe story is simple and straightforward; a zero-to-hero tale with few surprises (think Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, Disney's Hercules, or the on-the-nose straight to video sequel Hercules: Zero to Hero). But the strength of the characters, humour of the script, and more importantly the remarkable execution of flying and dragon vs. dragon fight scenes make the film enjoyable throughout. Hiccup is an endearing protagonist, appealing to teen awkwardness and a desire for acceptance from both peers and family. The supporting cast is a good mix of headstrong and suitably jerky-come-friendly teenagers, while Stoick, as his name might suggest, is a strong but distant patriarch, making for one of the funniest \"good talk\" scenes between father and son.\n\nThe dragons are by far the best part of the film, which offers up a half-dozen or so of uniquely characterized beasts, including a two headed menace with one head that spews gas and another that acts as pilot light, and a giant spindly red dragon that tends to set itself on fire. Hiccup's pet dragon, dubbed Toothless (for his retractable razor sharp teeth), is clearly modeled after your dog (and everyone else's) and his puppy-like naivet\u00e9 trapped in a sleek, pebbled, 30 foot frame will strike a chord with all pet owners. Oh, and he's also a major bad-ass black dragon that you can ride and he has laser-precise blue fireball action and is capable of speeds likely measured in \"Mach\"s and you want one. The flying scenes in this film are captivating and fun and represent some of the most engaging use of 3D technology I've seen.\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon is pure vicarious wish fulfillment, watering a seed planted in older viewers by The Never Ending Story, and likely planting one in younger viewers too young to remember Atreyu and Falkor. Endearing, enchanting, and engaging, a fun movie for anyone who ever wanted to ride a dragon. 8/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Based on a novel with the same name, writer William Davies was able to turn this kids story into a touching and deep first-class screenplay that is really rare for Dream Works. Hiccup, voiced by the devastating and believable Jay Baruchel, is a weak and low self-esteem little boy who lives in a world of Vikings. His dad and his friends, all around him, their life mission is to kill dragons and Hiccup is expected to do the same. Going through training and a lot of trying, Hiccup was not successful. Instead of killing dragons, Hiccup decided to read books on the dragons and found out they are not that bad. The belief was brought on after Hiccup met a dragon, who was considered the most dangerous dragon and did not try to eat him. This created a interesting but predictable twist for the audience to eat up on. Hiccup named his \"friend\" Toothless. Months go by as Hiccup trains his dragon friend Toothless to fly since he was injured when Hiccup found him. Throughout the training, their relationship begins to build and we see that Hiccup is falling in love. The writer really wanted us to cry at this point because Hiccup's friend Toothless was discovered by the town people and he's being killed by them. At the end, we know that dragons aren't as bad and Vikings shouldn't be killing them. This really looks like Disney's work because the message and the tone of the film is based on being friends and nice and all. At first, I thought this was not Dream Work's work, but after checking up on it, I was surprised. This looked more like Disney's cheesy work than Dream Work's. How To Train Your Dragon is classy, funny, kid-friendly, and intelligently scripted. It is one of the best films of the year. OscarBuzz: Best Animated Feature, this will go head to head against Toy Story 3. Even though Toy Story 3 definitely has a lead, if it didn't win, How To Train Your Dragon would snatch the Oscar."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"How to Train Your Dragon\" is a captivating animated adventure film that follows the story of a young Viking named Hiccup who defies tradition to befriend a dragon, ultimately changing the course of his village's history. Released in 2010, the film is based on the book of the same name by Cressida Cowell and directed by Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois.\n\nThe film is set in the mythical Viking village of Berk, where dragons are a constant threat to the villagers and their livestock. Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) is a young Viking who dreams of becoming a dragon slayer like his father, Stoick the Vast (voiced by Gerard Butler), the chief of Berk. However, Hiccup is different from the other Vikings - he's intelligent, inventive, and doesn't quite fit in with the warrior lifestyle of his peers.\n\nDuring a dragon raid, Hiccup manages to shoot down a Night Fury, the most feared dragon of all, using one of his inventions. But when he goes to find and kill it, he discovers that he can't bring himself to do it. Instead, he frees the dragon, whom he names Toothless, and begins a secret friendship with him.\n\nAs Hiccup learns more about dragons through his interactions with Toothless, he discovers that they are not the mindless monsters everyone believes them to be. With his newfound knowledge, Hiccup starts to challenge the long-standing feud between Vikings and dragons, much to the dismay of his father and the other villagers.\n\nThe animation in \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is stunning, with beautifully crafted landscapes and thrilling flight sequences that truly bring the world of Berk to life. The characters are well-developed and endearing, with Hiccup and Toothless forming a heartwarming bond that drives the emotional core of the film.\n\nIn addition to its breathtaking visuals, the film also delivers a powerful message about friendship, acceptance, and the importance of understanding and empathy. It's a tale of self-discovery and bravery that resonates with audiences of all ages.\n\nOverall, \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is a delightful and heartwarming film that combines action, humor, and emotion in a way that appeals to both children and adults. With its memorable characters, stunning animation, and touching story, it's no surprise that it has become a beloved classic in the world of animated cinema."

You can't help but feel a compassion for each of the characters that, bolstered by the animation, causes you to laugh, cry, and gasp aloud. Here we have the typical coming of age story with father-son disagreements, special animal-man relationships, pacifist sentiments, and predictable romance-- such themes are no strangers to film. But this story in particular is stocked with pithy, intelligent dialogue and easy humor without seeming to relish in its own accomplishment. The movie packs in a lot of information in its too-short hour and a half. I wouldn't have minded if that time was doubled. Many others are comparing How to Train Your Dragon to Avatar. While there are obvious similarities, I must say that I found the characters in HTTYD considerably more compelling; I never came close to crying in Avatar. I also did not expect the slight twist in the ending here. I won't give it away, but it was a refreshing change from the stereotyped finales that everyone predicts before the movie begins (again, I'm looking at Avatar). Overall, How to Train Your Dragon is fun enough for children and intelligent enough for adults. This college student certainly enjoyed it, and was utterly consumed. I experienced a slight shock when I looked to the side and saw my familiar, non-dragon friends still sitting beside me. Anyone can (and most will) enjoy this."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am not a DreamWorks fan. At all. I get irritated when people compare them to Pixar, because when's the last time DreamWorks did anything memorable?! I've never even liked Shrek much! Most would answer my question with this: The most overrated animated movie of all time. It's about a Viking civilisation who have a on-going battle with dragons. A hapless son of the Viking chief begins an unlikely friendship with a dragon and realizes there's more to them. How To Train Your Dragon proves Pixar aren't the only ones who do great visuals, as it looks absolutely great. The story is deeper than one might expect and some of the flying sequences make you feel like you're flying with the dragons. It's a good visual experience and has a couple of good bits, but that's pretty much all I enjoyed. The main problem is that this doesn't tell me anything I haven't been told before. I've seen all these characters before. This story and moral has been done to death. When's the last time I saw animated humans and animals becoming friends? Or flying sequences? Or underdog stories? Maybe last week.\n\nThe 90 minute run time is too short for an epic storyline. Too much of the film is rushed into montages and a lot of scenes feel rushed as a result. The film's emotional impact is minimal as the dialogue lacks flair and it moves along too quickly. The characters are some of the most clich\u00e9d I've seen in an animated movie, with the love interest having zero chemistry with the rather formulaic hero, although he's coolly named Hiccup. The script is so flat it might as well have been sat on by a dragon. It's not funny or particularly exciting and it feels like the same family feel good fare DW spit out at us year after year, their films like products on a conveyor belt leading out from a factory. This is not some great ground-breaking movie, rather a relatively ordinary and to be truly honest pretty darn boring affair. It looks great, but the story is irritating (Hiccup only gets accepted when he does something heroic) and everything about feels uninspired. It is another trip into clich\u00e9 town from DreamWorks. The only difference is that this time we're riding a dragon. What a waste of time!\n\n4/10"

How to Train Your Dragon is an excellent and enjoyable film with Vikings and Dragons, mixed with good, pure humour, thrilling, jaw-dropping actions scenes and chases \u2013 on dragons, of course. Jay Baruchel voices Hiccup, a Viking who is so not a Viking. He's that puny, stick figure in comparison to his disappointed and huge, buff dad, Stoick (voiced by Gerard Butler) who also happens to be the village's chief. Hiccup can't kill dragons to save his life. But what he does instead is accidentally catch the most powerful and deadly dragon in history, a Night Fury, and befriends it. He feeds him fish (no eel), makes a harness and trains him to fly while riding on his back.\n\nIt's your typical story, and the dragon flying scenes are almost mirror images of Avatar's grandiose scenes; Hiccup is that weakling and underdog, yet it's just human nature to cheer him on. Along the way we want to see him defy the odds and succeed against everybody's expectations. Quirky and fun, this extremely well-made animation teaches a great lesson for kids: don't be afraid to be yourself and believe that you can achieve great things. Of course, it's just as entertaining for adults, and along with Shrek and Kung Fu Panda, DreamWorks has struck gold with another animated masterpiece."

This series is set on a (fictional) island to the north of what is now Scotland. The Norwegians settled on those islands and their people married into the clans there. Therefore, it would make sense for the characters to have Scottish accents yet share aspects of Norwegian culture. The author of the books has also stated her ancestors are from that area, and that's why she chose to write a series about them.\n\nAnyways, the movie itself is lighthearted and great entertainment for the whole family. Toothless is hilarious."

The creature design is fantastic.\n\nCharacters - A lot of these characters are pretty underdeveloped. Most of the plot relies on characters making dumb decisions. There are many points in this movie when I want to yell at characters for being idiots.\n\nPlot - The plot is full of devices that make mad. There are so many instances in this movie where illogical things just happen to be convenient for the plot. There are lots of things that are set up and then later ignored. Overall the story is very entertaining but there is enough stupid in it holding it back from being as great as it could be. That doesn't mean that this movie isn't extremely entertaining. There's just a little too much nonsense for it to be as good as it could be."

The soundtrack is what you expect it to be, nothing new/innovative there... So: Excellent film for your kids or for an adult who wants some excellent waste-time. But nothing exciting, innovative, surprising... If you're looking for something to rock your world, there's a lot of better animations out there (try Howl's moving castle, Princess Mononoke, ....)"

The whole movie really revolves around Hiccup and Toothless, his young dragon.\n\nAs one other reviewer stated, Toothless exhibits masses of personality and is like a huge lovable puppy. Being able to display this level of personality without uttering a single word is beyond impressive.\n\nThe addition of romance, comedy and action galore makes this a movie for all the family as I assume was Dreamworks aim.\n\nThis is truly a fun movie that has to be seen to be believed.\n\n9/10"

        "review_title": "A truly moving CGI animated epic from such a great animation company!",
        "review_detailed_main": "Seeing as how Dreamworks Animation continues to become #5 of the animation companies and has worked on both traditional animated features along with computer animated ones. Some of them (Prince of Egypt, Road to El Dorado, Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron, Shrek 1, 2 and 4, Kung Fu Panda 1-2, Monsters VS Aliens, Madagascar 1-2) are my favorites and some of them aren't my favorites and were quite weak for the company (Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas, Shark Tale, Bee Movie), although Megamind was pretty good even though it wasn't a masterpiece. Before and after those films, they made their very first take on a story the fantasy genre two years ago: A tale of vikings fighting against dragons, but only one person can make the difference to make peace with them. How To Train Your Dragon, directed by Disney animator Chris Sanders, is that story and upon it's release, it was hugely praised by the critics and had almost gained an 100%.\n\nFirst off, before I would review what I thought about this movie, I would like to say that I wasn't into the books or the first installment this movie was based on, but seeing the trailers really got me interested and have been wanting to see it perhaps during spring break of summer of 2010, the year this was released. My decision to see that movie was during the summer... only in a 3-D version with the glasses that I wore and saw the movie with much anticipation. Then, after the movie, I walked out of the theater, saying to myself, \"That... was... EPIC!!!\" Never, and I mean, never have I seen a CGI animated feature film so breathtakingly epic and I think that it's one of Dreamwork's best since Shrek and Kung Fu Panda.\n\nThe story is so original and is really quite simple: One of the worst vikings in history captures a dragon, during a battle between vikings and dragons, and instead of killing it, he befriends it. While he makes a bond with the dragon, he gains not only the reputation of the whole viking village in Berk, but his own girlfriend. Later, he realizes that everything he and the other vikings know about the dragons is wrong (according to the trailer) and has to make a difference to make peace between dragons and vikings and battle the most deadliest dragon in history. I really liked that idea as it did justice to the book it was based on (I read it later and I thought it was extremely good) with witty and smart dialog, some heartwarming moments, some hilarious moments and some dramatic, not to mention epic, moments while teaching a moral lesson for the children ages +8-12.\n\nThen, there's the action sequences with the vikings and the dragons and boy were they so epic. The opening was so dark and intense and I really liked it, especially the other scenes with the dragons and the final battle where Hiccup and Toothless battle against the Green Death (changed from the named Red Dragon in the book). OK, I really hate to make two sentences about why I think the action was great so short, but I'm just going to have to keep going right now.\n\nThe strongest aspects goes to two things of the entire movie. First, there's the animation. It's so beautiful with a wonderfully detailed look of the viking village, the forest, and the dragon cave where the Green Death eats one of the dragons alive and the character animation is so stunning and very realistic with facial expressions on them. The best aspect of the animation goes to the character animations on the dragons with an excellent look. Then, there's the music from the great John Powell and given the fact that he did some good music from other animated films including Shrek, Robots, Ice Age 2, Kung Fu Panda, Bolt, and Ice Age 3, this is one of his best music ever made in a movie for kids. It has the Scottish and Irish tones to it and it successfully fits well with the moments in the movie which makes it's soundtrack so memorable to listen to. I also liked the song \"Sticks and Stones from Jonsi and I wish to listen to it every day in every month.\n\nThe voice acting is excellent. Jay Baruchel did great as Hiccup, Gerald Butler (Phantom of the Opera) did great as Stoick, Hiccup's father, Craig Ferguson was so hilarious as Goober, America Ferrera did very good as Astrid, Hiccup's love interest, and others including, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Jonah Hill, T.J. Miller and Kristen Wiig did excellent as the other vikings.\n\nOverall, How To Train Your Dragon is by no means a masterpiece of computer animation and I would love to see the sequel which will come out in about two more years. Thumbs up from me!"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"How to train your dragon\" is based on a humorous fantasy novel of the same name. I cannot compare the stories of the two but where the book has rather ugly pictures, the movie dazzles with amazing visuals. I think they would be great looking even if you didn't see the movie in 3d. It's not only the quality of the renders, it's the quality of the animation. I think it works best when the young viking Hiccup starts to interact with the fallen dragon. They are very lifelike and expressive even though the dragon does not talk. Later on, the flying sequences are not only spectacular but exhilarating. I had my doubts about the look of the main dragon (the one on the posters) but it managed to win my approval in both looks (a bit small though) but mostly personality wise.\n\nThere's lots of very dynamic exciting action in this movie and it's mostly done with a cheerful fun tone most of the time even though there's still danger. As I recall, there's no visible gore, dismemberments or even blood, making it very family friendly. However, despite that lack of \"realism\", I do think that adults will enjoy it a lot too. The story is not the most original (except for the original premise) but it's very well told, with good character development and has a fairly good morale for those into that. I think Gerard Butler voicing the viking chief is a natural for that kind of stoic warrior role. However, I would have preferred another voice for the teen hero as I found it sounding too old (the actor is in his late twenties). The rest of the voice cast is fine. My only other criticism is that there's a part of the ending that we've seen a hundred times before especially in kids movies and I would have preferred a little more originality there or at least see it better done because I didn't really buy into it. So, all in all, provided you still have a little bit of a kid's heart in you and are not allergic to dragons, it's likely you will have a great time watching this very entertaining movie.\n\nRating : 8 out of 10"

        "review_detailed_main": "A young Viking befriends a deadly dragon in this gorgeously-animated, but almost mediocre family adventure film. In How to Train Your Dragon, Jay Baruchel voices an awkward teenager named Hiccup who's determined to fit in with his Viking town, under the pressure of his father who's deciding to get him into training for fighting dragons. But he encounters and becomes friends with the Night Fury dragon and must prove to his father and town that the creatures are not what they seemed.\n\nThis animated adventure is entertaining, along with some jokes and mildly scary moments, with a well-paced story that'll appeal to families and young children. If you've seen a lot, you'll find that probably the majority of family-targeted fantasy-adventure animations or Disney/Pixar movies always feature engaging storylines, topped with appealing elements from talking animals to magical fantasy creatures. How to Train Your Dragon simply blends Vikings, dragons, fire-breathing action and a theme of misjudgement.\n\nWithout a doubt, movies like this, along with Avatar, should be seen in 3D at all opportunities. Not only are the action sequences absolutely gorgeous, but the colourful dragons themselves and the depictions of the settings are equally as beautiful. Families will appreciate this movie's positive themes, as well as the voice acting, characters and plot, worth breaking out the popcorn for.\n\nIf you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've seen this movie a couple of times now, all of them in normal 2D since I think every movie should be judged by its basic format free from any gimmick. I really liked this movie a lot, although there are a couple of aspects that were a setback to me which I'm gonna list below.\n\nFirst of are the clich\u00e9's, How To Train Your Dragon has a lot of clich\u00e9's particularly in its characters; you have the tough girl that everyone likes, the aggressive bully, the nerdy fat kid, the annoying 'funny' twins. These are all things that regular movie-goers probably won't mind, but for me they felt kind of tiresome and I felt that it didn't add a lot to the overall picture, nor do I feel that any of them were particularly funny or entertaining as characters.\n\nThe other thing that I didn't really like was the voice of our main protagonist Hiccup (Jay Baruchel). This is somewhat a hit or miss, because he does seem to do a pretty good job with the voice, and at times he does come across like he's having a good time but to me his nasally voice gets a bit irritating. But this is just a minor personal preference. The voice-cast overall is pretty damn good though, if you can at least appreciate the humour of vikings with over the top Scottish accents.\n\nThese are the few downsides of the movie, but How To Train Your Dragon luckily has a lot of entertainment to offer. To begin with, the visuals are great. Particularly the flying-scenes are easily the highlight of the movie, which I think most people would agree with me. Besides that, the movie has just the right pacing, giving us good insight into the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless. The creators also avoided turning this into a typical love-story which I liked, and the ending is spectacular to say the least.\n\nHow To Train Your Dragon is a excellent movie for the entire family like you would expect from a company like Dreamworks. Well worth the money and time."

        "review_detailed_main": "What I find so impressive with How to train your dragon is what I also stated in the title of this review, it has something for people of most ages. Also the stuff that will be enjoyed by the younger and the more grown up are not necessarily always the same things. I shall explain further what I mean by that. The story works great in that it is perfectly considered for the younger group. But I think the older part of the viewers will feel that the story just works well, not that it's bad or to thin in any way but just nothing special for them. What the more grown ups will find so brilliant is the humor. The humor is brilliant, specially the dialogue. The dialogue is so fun to listen to. But the reason is not really the jokes which I don't think have such a big part. The voices are brilliant and the dialogue is spoken in slack tone that make me laugh out loud just hearing it no matter what exactly is being said. The film also contains so parts of slapstick humor which all will find funny and it doesn't take a to big role either. Personally I found the humorous parts of much more entertainment than the story which filled it's part enough but not anything more. One other pleasure with this film is the animation, both technically and aesthetically. The humans look funny which is great but this is more a film about dragons and those also are the biggest viewing pleasure. Not only are they superbly designed but the way they move and specially the faces is massively impressive. The dragons behavior makes me think of cats and they definitively studied real animals for the animation. The dragons are both cute and fun to watch. There are some sentimental scenes in it to. What is impressive is that the emotional stuff more come from the visual rather than like more often story depth. The flying scenes are very impressive in the design and actually makes me think of Avatar, yes I think it's done on that level and I haven't seen dragon in 3D. Does the movie contain some moral message. Others have commented that it has, often I don't like when movies try to hide some message under a great production like some kind of propaganda. However even if someone maybe thinks this has some point to make it's nothing that I took any really note of so one can enjoy the film just as a piece of entertainment and that all which I am thankful for. How to train your dragon is a brilliantly entertaining piece. Perfect humor and effects, the part I enjoyed the most. Also it has a great story for the younger and works enough for the older to. When the film is over I feel like I could soon see it again and enjoy it just as much. I give How to train your dragon a 8/10. Great!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Ah, good ol' Dreamworks. As their most successful-albeit overused-cash cow is the Shrek series; it's pretty hard to distinguish any other of their movies as gems. However, while a humorous approach has been taken to their movies, many of them have had different results. For example, the 2004 movie 'Shark Tale' was an utter disaster, while 2008's 'Kung Fu Panda' was funny as well as plenty entertaining. Their latest romp, 'How to Train your Dragon,' definitely falls into the same category as the latter, but also succeeds in distinguishing itself as a completely different movie.\n\nBased on the book series by British author Cressida Cowell and directed by Disney alum Chris Sanders (Lilo and Stitch), the story centers around a young Viking lad named Hiccup (Jay Baruchel, whose nasal tone compliments him both physically and mentally) whose absent- minded ideas and wry sense of humor make him outcasted by other Viking teens, as well as shunned by his father, the mighty Stoick (Gerard Butler, also perfect). But, when one of his inventions actually manages to capture the mysterious Night Fury, he finds himself befriending it in secret, as well as learning from it to become the first 'dragon trainer.' But when he finds himself at odds with not only the town, but with the dragons themselves, he also finds himself with the key to making peace betwixt the dragons and Vikings.\n\nThe plot itself-even in a nutshell-is pretty enticing, but the trailer proved otherwise. It looked formulaic and joke-ridden from the first trailer, which made my skeptical side say, 'no way, Jose!' However, during the second trailer, I was reeled in. It was more dramatic, more depth defying, and definitely more plausible. From there, I was eager to see it\u0085and, let me say, its money well spent.\n\nAt first, it seems that the plot is going to be a little formulaic. You know the story: The underdog, who everyone hates and can't seem to do anything right, proves the town wrong with his groundbreaking, but effective methods. That has indeed been done before, but, surprisingly, this plot enhances the story instead of slowing it down. Anything that seems to be a clich\u00e9 only gives the story the wings to fly...excuse the pun.\n\nThe other big issue I had was with the side characters. No, I don't mean the brash, but helpful Gobber (played by a highly entertaining Craig Ferguson) or the beautiful, fiercely driven Astrid (America Fererra). I mean some of the other teens who are thrown into the dragon training ring with Hiccup, who is inept at first, but his friendship with Toothless helps him make his way up. Anyway, I thought that these four teens: The pigheaded jock, Snotlout (Jonah Hill, another cash cow), the adorable, girth-wide nerd Fishlegs (Christopher Mintz- Plasse, aka Superbad's McLovin), and, my personal favorites, the jugheaded, head-butting twins Ruffnut (a gravelly-voiced Kristen Wigg) and Tuffnut (A snarky TJ Miller). The latter have become a cult following that is huge in the online and fandom communities, much to the moviegoer's surprise. However, in the movie, these teens are only here to serve as the play- it-by-numbers obstacles that our main hero has to overcome on his own, though there are definitely more pressing issues. I would have liked to see more of them in the film, despite the fact that they might take away from the story. It just would have been nice to see someone sympathize with Hiccup.\n\nOh, and one more thing-the dragons, man! All of them also have different types and personalities, which I think is kind of awesome. The flying scenes are pretty cool too, described by many to make 'Avatar' jealous. There's a lot to look at, so why not? Overall, this movie has more heart than most of their works (Save 'Kung Fu Panda'), as well as unbelievably creative settings and creatures. It's definitely worth the time to be swept off your feet by this instant classic."

The story revolves around Hiccup a young Viking boy who is the son of the chief of a Viking tribe that hunts and kills dragons because they constantly attack and raid the village and so they are at war. When hiccup, luck might have it, successfully shoots down a dragon and begins to befriend the beast. This is where the story becomes excellent, to bond between Hiccup and his new dragon friend Toothless. Hiccup learns to train toothless and builds a contraption that can help him fly. When discovering they both need each other to survive, they become inseparable, and it is up to the two of them to show the rest of the Vikings that dragons can be understood and, with a bit of patience, can be trained like dogs. This is a movie that respects children and wants them to be invested in the characters for the whole film without getting bored. This film is incredibly successful in doing so by being funny, compelling, and most of all mature. Along with stunning visuals and one of the best musical scores in film history, it was even nominated for Best Original Score at the Oscars, this film delivers on everything you would want to see in a great film.

        "review_detailed_main": "After seeing this film three times now (twice in 3D on the silver screen and once on the idiot box), I'm of the opinion that it is a near-perfect masterpiece of modern animation. When this film came out in 2010, I was enraptured and astonished by the beauty and colour of this northern world with its stalwart Viking society and wonderful variety of dragons. Who was responsible for that? Art director Pierre-Olivier Vincent? I'm sure it was a whole team of people. The 3D effects are spectacular. The engaging and heartwarming story (based on a book by Cressida Cowell) hits home for both kids and adults. Hiccup, the little Viking who could, is a great character. Some of it is clich\u00e9, but it didn't matter. Yes, I know it's a movie for kids, but there was something clever about it that raised it to a level that adults can appreciate. Kudos to DeBlois, Davies and Sanders for bringing us this imaginative, evocative and, yes, magical film. It's going to be hard to beat this in 2014, but they can certainly count on filling the seats."

However if I am looking at this movie objectively there are a few flaws: The movie can be tonally inconsistent (one minute it is quite serious the next they are cracking jokes although the humor is very good), The animation while glorious for it's time and still very good by today's standards is a bit dated now that it's much more well animated sequel is out, There are quite a few plot conveniences and one giant plot hole. Now that that unpleasantness is out of the way I can talk about what is good: The writing is mostly excellent (these are some of the most three dimensional characters I have ever seen in my life, I can relate to the main character very easily), The voice acting is terrific (yes I know the accents are weird but I cannot imagine anybody else voicing these characters), the action is terrific, I have HEARD that the 3d is the best in existence and I do not doubt it, the cinematography is amazing, the pacing is terrific, the attention to detail is spectacular and this is the best musical score in existence. This is an amazing movie that focuses on the characters instead of the action. It is not afraid to take risks. I am giving this movie an instant classic award."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"How to Train Your Dragon\" is a visually captivating animated film from DreamWorks, directed by Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois. The movie centers around Hiccup, a young Viking who doesn't quite fit in with his dragon-hunting tribe. Voiced by Jay Baruchel, Hiccup is inventive and kind-hearted, making him a relatable and endearing protagonist.\n\nThe plot takes an unexpected turn when Hiccup befriends an injured dragon he names Toothless. This friendship challenges the longstanding beliefs of his community and sets Hiccup on a path of self-discovery and bravery. The bond between Hiccup and Toothless is beautifully portrayed, highlighting themes of understanding, acceptance, and the courage to defy tradition.\n\nThe animation in \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is top-notch, with breathtaking flight sequences and richly detailed environments that bring the mythical world to life. John Powell's stirring score further elevates the emotional and adventurous moments of the film.\n\nWhile the storyline follows some familiar tropes, its heartfelt execution and charming characters make it a memorable and engaging experience. \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is a delightful adventure that celebrates the power of friendship and the importance of challenging the status quo."

        "review_detailed_main": "How To Train Your Dragon (2010) -\n\nI personally can't see why my Niece and Nephews enjoy this film as much as they do.\n\nI don't think that there's enough going on really or maybe it just feels like they're simply walking through it and not living it? And it's certainly not got as much humour as I would expect from a cartoon, I hardly laughed at all.\n\nIt's also really frustrating that the Dad refuses to listen to his son and as such the whole village goes off on a macho, war hungry attempt to kill all of the dragons. The attitude feels quite outdated now and yes I do realise that it is set in the time of the Viking's, but kids films are supposed to show them the way and build their moral standing, not teach them that violence is the answer.\n\nAnd why are they part Scottish and part American?\n\nI actually found the voices quite off putting. Hiccup in particular seemed really wrong and not just because he was an American voice born to a Scottish one, but he didn't really suit the character.\n\nIf they'd all been Scottish, it might have made slightly more sense, but all the different voices made it feel more like a multi cultural metropolis rather than a tiny island and it irked me.\n\nAnd another thing, the Dad is actually quite horrible. The way he treats and speaks to his son is not funny, it's child abuse. He even encourages others to ridicule him. That's just bullying! I expect better from Gerrard.\n\nI just don't think that the film as a whole shows the type of behaviour that the current generation should be seeing and finding acceptable.\n\nI also found the turnaround at the end to be too quick and hard to believe.\n\nI almost think that they should treat kids films as adult films when writing them and then add in or take away what they need to, in order to give it the U/PG rating. If it doesn't work for adults, it shouldn't be shown to kids. Children need believable stories as well as fairy tales.\n\nWhat I did like was Toothless. He was well animated and his cat like antics were amusing. Otherwise the animation wasn't that brilliant for me, as if they'd asked kids to draw the dragons and then given them a CGI treatment.\n\nIt's ok as kids films go and will probably entertain most 7-12 year olds (Or 16/22 & 24 year old Nieces and Nephews), but as an adult watching it, I think that the studios could work harder to produce more films like 'Toy Story' (1995), 'Shrek' (2001) and 'Finding Nemo' (2003) that appeal to everyone without cheapening the story and that are still more factually accurate and appropriate.\n\nBut what do I know? It's spawned two sequels, two spin off series' and at least two short film specials. The oldest Nephew (22) says that the second one is better and the third is the best. We will see if he's right when he comes over next Sunday to watch number 2?\n\n419.39/1000."

        "review_detailed_main": "Many die hard toy-story fans will hate me for saying it, and while I am a huge fan of Pixar movies, How to Train Your Dragon is the best animated movie I have, and likely will ever see. On the first hand it has a unique story. Of course in the broad sense it is an \"underdog gains special powers and triumphs\" movie, but it has much more under the surface. The deep emotions between the main character and the dragon are powerful to say the least. The animations are whimsical enough to be enjoyed by children, but many scenes feature elements that knock the breath out of even the most critical viewers.\n\nOne of my favorite elements of the movie was the soundtrack, it is literally, unarguably, exceptionally, perfect. The music matches every movement and every emotion. There is one scene in particular that has me holding my breath every time I see it, and the incredible music is what brings it all together.\n\nIf you haven't watched How to Train Your Dragon, you are missing out. In summary, I would describe this movie as a beautifully created tale of simple concept, with monumental outcome."

        "review_detailed_main": "Just watched this 3-D computer animated movie with my movie theatre friend who had seen this a couple of times before. It's an awesome tale of a young man named Hiccup (voice of Jay Baruchel) wanting to become a real Viking like his dad, Stoick (Gerald Butler). But one thing he doesn't want to do is kill dragons especially when he befriends one he names Toothless...While there's some witty lines and some humorous visuals, this was a mainly compellingly stirring adventure tale about standing up for your principals despite the prevailing mood of the crowd. I'll leave it at that and just mention the other voices that were heard here: America Ferrera, Jonah Hill, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Kristen Wiig, and, the only one I actually recognized while watching, Craig Ferguson. All of those and others contributed wonderful performances. Special thanks to the writer/directors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders for the entire thing, which should come as no surprise since they also did the equally entertaining Lilo and Stitch at Disney back almost 10 years ago. So on that note, I highly recommend How to Train Your Dragon."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's a purity of vision in 'How To Train Your Dragon (2010)', one that sees it work incredibly well as a tightly-constructed, somewhat allegorical fable that has a strong central message. It focuses pretty much entirely on delivering this message, sometimes to the detriment of character and, even, story. All in all, it's kind of flat. Its world, and the people within it, are very two-dimensional and only change when the narrative needs them to. This, as I mentioned, serves its themes and, in a way, tightens its plot, but it does make things seem kind of surface-level. It's most noticeable with the father character; he feels like a caricature and, without spoiling anything, must be in contender for the 'worst dad of the year' award. Still, this overall dedication to theme makes for a focused experience that knows exactly what it's trying to achieve. For the most part, it achieves that. The 'all is lost' moment is very frustrating, which goes to show just how invested we are in our likeable protagonist's journey. This is helped by a fantastic soundtrack, which is probably the picture's greatest asset. The animation itself is decent but the actual rendering is slightly off. Most characters feel dead behind the eyes and, in some cases, it's kind of creepy; again, this is most notable with the father character. Still, the story is brought to life well enough and, during the flick's action set-pieces, the visuals often evoke a great sense of speed and spectacle while still conveying character, essentially, above all else. In fact, here character through action is often more successful than character through dialogue. The flick is entertaining, in general. It's not perfect, certainly, but it moves briskly enough that most of its issues come second to its integrity and overall fun. It's probably one of Dreamworks' better animated efforts, though it's certainly no 'Shrek (2001)'. 7/10"

What else do you need from a review?\n\nThe animation is pretty nice, even if 3Dish, with very realistic facial expressions, bright colors and large landscapes. The plot is kind of classic, with the weird kid who longs for his father's acceptance and the love of the town's girl getting his wish. The twists are that the kid is a viking and their entire village is plagued by pesky dragons. In the end, a peaceful solution is found, even if a bit ironic. Let's say it's a typically human solution and leave it at that.\n\nWhat I liked about the movie is that the animated characters were not mere projections of the actors playing them, and the animals were not anthropomorphised versions of their real selves. Actually, the black dragon with big green eyes looked and behaved suspiciously like my black cat with big green eyes. Only a bit smarter... and flying. Clearly a cat lover worked on this film.\n\nBottom line: has a Shreky freshness to it, even if the script is not parody funny, but situation funny. Good quality in animation, voices, direction and storyline. The ending was a bit mushy, but full of good tension and held itself well. Oh, and the girls loved it."

        "review_detailed_main": "How to Train Your Dragon is a breathtakingly animated movie which deserves high praise for that, but even though it has a couple of really good elements it also has noticable drawbacks. I'll explain\n\nOne of the best aspects of HTTYD is the animation. The flight scenes and the discovery of the dragons are highlights of the movie, because the creativity put into making every dragon unique is wonderful, and when you see those landscapes from above your jaw will drop. Just amazing work of animation. Another great thing is this very real and organic build-up of the friendship between Hiccup and Toothless, because it's not an easy task, and that leads to the later conflict which is clich\u00e9d but is well excecuted\n\nNo wonder Chris Sanders had a directoral role in this moving story, after all he was the writer of Disney's Lilo & Stitch which also had touchingly dramatic scenes. Toothless reminded me of Stitch, and it isn't hard to guess why the writer of that that movie could make a character with similar mannerisms.\n\nBut many of these characters are pretty weak in their characterizations, because they either come off as one-note, mean-spirited or both. Hiccup's co-students in his training to become a viking warrior are easily described with simple tropes with almost no depth to them. Well, Astrid has some dimensions to her, because she discovers Hiccup's secret as the story progresses, but the others are kind of annoying one-trope characters. And Hiccup's father kept on being so mean to him that I found him pretty hateable, because even when his son has proven his worth he still makes less blatant mean comments. That aspect of the movie just got on my nerves.\n\nThe sequel is better in my opinion, because its focus is more on the world around them rather than on the characters and bigger consequences happened and added a less predictable feel to its story, but HTTYD started it all so therefore I can't deny it's worth.\n\nSo all in all: Breathtaking animation and a well excecuted start of a beautiful friendship between two characters are highlights in an otherwise predictable story with many weak characters."

In his village however this is unappreciated as what they need are strong, beefy men to fend off the nightly attack of the local dragons. However during the last attack Hiccup believes he has killed the most dangerous dragon of all, the mysterious night-fury, and upon searching the forest, Hiccup does indeed find the downed beast. Although he knows he should kill the dragon which is what he is trained to do, Hiccup releases the beast, and over time, due to circumstances I won't go into here an unlikely bond develops between man and dragon. Hiccup eventually uses this knowledge to overcome other Dragons as his father (Stoic) enrols him into Dragon killing class, but will the knowledge be enough to finally gain his father's respect and save his village?\n\nDreamworks animation has over the years provided us with much in the way of animated comedies and it is an area they usually excel in, from Shrek to Madagascar and the most recent of comedic hits, Kung Fu Panda, the studio shines in their ability to tap into today's post- modern thinking, but the two things their films may have lacked before now is, perhaps, a genuine sense of fear for the characters, something that the best Pixar films always have, and ...heart; the ability to tap into that part of us that puts us firmly into the characters plight on screen.\n\nThis is the first Dreamworks film that succeeds were others have failed. It is always a good sign when a films box office performance increases due to extremely positive word of mouth. The only other film I can think of that has done this is the Farrelly's \"There's something about Mary\". The story of Hiccup and toothless is charming, scary in parts, but very endearing and the animation is not as overtly stylized and, well, not quite as good as Pixar-esquire, as previous outings have been. The voice work is very good by the four leads, Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, Craig Ferguson and America Ferreira, and the main threat, when it is ultimately revealed, is one that is genuinely frightening. There are few things better in cinema than that feeling of \"How the hell is the hero gonna beat that?\"\n\nThe direction and writing are decent enough but this is one of those films were the sum of the parts are actually far more than the the individual pieces combined. But perhaps the best thing about this film is, well without giving anything away, it's the fact that we don't get a complete pat happy ending. The final reveal of the horror of war and battle is almost unbelievable in a family film and I was completely shocked that a major studio had the guts to do something like this in a big budget movie and we should all doff are hats to them for such a bold move.\n\nCongratulations Deamworks animation. You've come of age."

The story is set in the land of Vikings, who are rough, fearless and strong people, and kill dragons (really ?) to save their city. Then there is a Viking boy, Hiccup, who does not kill a dragon he captures and later becomes friend with it, whom he names as Toothless. Apart from them, there are many characters, playing very important roles in the movie. The movie contains brilliant graphics and astonishing visuals but the main power lies in its plot. The impressive characters and the storyline is the heart of the movie. Though it does not give much time to the characters to grow up in our heart, but that's justified for the pace of the movie and the huge variety of things it provides. There are happy moments, there are sad moments but I can guarantee that there is not a single dull moment in the whole film.\n\nWe may have seen such a story of friendship between a human and a beast before, but somehow this movie still manages to look fresh and keep us constantly engaged in its plot.

        "review_detailed_main": "It took me a while to get to watch this movie, since I've heard and seen so much about it (that includes the TV show on CN). I only got the chance to see it recently this year and I was extremely pleasantly surprised by it.\n\nRecently I started watching movie trailers way more rarely than I did years ago... and that made me totally blind coming into this movie. I knew almost nothing about it and that made me experience the movie and appreciating it a lot more than I would have, had I watched the trailer/s.\n\nFrom the first scene this movie captured my attention and made me interested in the story since it was something about medieval times and dragons. And being a somewhat fan of Game of Thrones I was hooked on from the moment Hiccup told the story about Berk and the fight against the dragons. First of all the animation and the way this movie is created is absolutely stunning and way ahead of its time. The story got me from the first moment and there wasn't a single moment where I was \"can we get over with this to move on to something more exciting?\". The 98 minutes flew by me and I felt inspired, moved and most of all motivated throughout the whole movie. The soundtrack... now I gotta address this... John Powell was robbed of Oscar in 2011. I don't care what anyone else says about that... I've seen The Social Network and that soundtrack was absolutely horrible. There were at least three other soundtracks in 2010 way better than that: The King's Speech - Alexandre Desplat, Inception - Hans Zimmer, and this one. Now I understand that you shouldn't award another oscar to a composer who already won one (Hans Zimmer) but how could the academy rob John Powell of the oscar is beyond me. His score was inspiring, powerful, well suited for the time frame in the movie and motivating. There were tracks that while the movie was playing and the scene was going, it made me shed tears of joy and inspiration. Now that doesn't happen often and I can only name a couple of movies that did that to me: Interstellar, Braveheart, Avengers: Infinity War, The Dark Knight, The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, ... I can honestly say that the best part of the movie was the score. The other great parts were, aside from the story which I already mentioned, the conclusion, the interactions between the characters and how everything tied together with everything.\n\nI could go on about the animation, cinematography or voice acting but for me a movie with a captivating story, wonderful soundtrack and inspiring and motivating moments is enough to call a masterpiece. And this is for me a masterpiece. One of the best animated films I've ever seen in my life!"

        "review_detailed_main": "What an average movie. I'm not sure why I went to see it except it was one of the more-highly rated movies at the local 2nd-run theatre and I was bored. During the 1st 5 minutes, I became pretty certain I wasn't going to like the thing; I couldn't understand the dialog because of the high level of background noise: sound, explosions, mayhem, characters yelling. Who can tell what they're saying? Even during the opening scene when we're somehow flying toward the village at night, I couldn't tell what the narrator is saying. Have we seen this formulaic tripe before? Yes: Misunderstood motherless nerdy boy who has the capability to change the world, if only his father and others would listen. Did any one see Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs? Same story. The second thing was the accents of the characters: Scots were Vikings! Who knew?? Yet their children speak like modern day Americans and act like them too: cliquish, bullying brats. People are the same, century after century. The dragon, Toothless, looks nothing like a killer-turned-pet by the boy's kindness. No, he's one of the stupidest-looking characters ever; more like giant tadpole. How did he lose 50% of his tail wing? Doesn't matter; without that, there's no story. And who knew: dragons eat fish! They must be part pelican. Something else we didn't know! What an education.... I'm still trying to figure out if the dragon was telepathic or what; how else did he know where the boy wanted him to fly? How did the strategy of how to avoid the big Momma dragon (we are never really told what the big and only MEAN dragon was, except that dragons are like bees and ants: they have a queen. Wow! Lizards have Queen lizards! Another revelation! Take notes, kids!!) Yep; turns out all the man-killers are really kind-at-heart, misunderstood, over-large pets. All we ever really needed to do was walk up and pet them. Again: who knew? If only we were as wise as our children! is once again the moral. Parents are left apologizing and in awe of the kids. So much for Confucius. Finally, we learn that it's really OK after all to kill a dragon as long as it's ugly and as big as an entire city. Makes sense to me..."

        "review_detailed_main": "How to Train Your Dragon is honestly one of my favourite films of all time. If you're a fan of fantasy animation such as Rise of the Guardians, Brave or Tangled then I highly recommend this film. By using key techniques that are done in a perfectly appropriate way, this mind- blowing film appeals to all audiences.\n\nThe film focuses on the importance of victory and acceptance, instead of a clich\u00e9 love story that is found in most family fantasy films. With the fantastic use of animation, working perfectly with the spiritual music, this film never fails to widen it's audience's eyes. You will never know what will happen next.\n\nThough very different from the original books, I personally prefer the ideas used in this film. Because of the chilling mystery and edgy humour, and with a hint of romance, the film sticks to the meaning of the plot without drifting off into some cheesy romantic comedy.\n\nAlso with the brilliant voice acting from Jay Baruchel, America Ferrera and Kristen Wiig, the characters vary personality; ranging from brave and superior to shy and timid, the characters are all likable. Then of course the legendary dragons, who seem to have personalities themselves, bring humour and imagination to the film, as well as going against the typical tropes of most dragon tales.\n\nOverall, I guarantee no matter how old you are, you will be amazed by this film."

        "review_detailed_main": "The story evolves around Hiccup: young, insecure want-to-be dragon hunter whose only cause is to impress his father and make him proud for slaying a dragon. That being said, movie reaches far from that.\n\nWhen you're creating one animation story, at least over the course of past several years, you see one grand opening with either background story or action ripping in. How to train your dragon brings kind a both. It sucks you into the story of present and past right in and you already know you want to keep watching it.\n\nWithout further due, animations are mind-blowing. Characters are relentless; they're so different from each other that you begin to wonder where the heck could they meet each other. But, after all, it just clicks. The whole concept of characterization just fits right in with the whole concept of story. Writers were well aware that one slight miss-course off of the plot would lead to an entire disaster and they focused their full attention on unraveling the story by unraveling characters. They both dwell through same course of actions; as the story develops, so do the characters. They're colorful, funny, \"wisdomous\", caring, patient, loving (sometimes annoying, yes) that you just have to fall in love with them. I actually read few reviews that are stating that this movie is unoriginal: for God's sake it's based on the book! On the book! On the bestseller book! The story IS original. But, seriously, if you're going to make a movie about dragons, how much originality you can pull off in that area? The bottom line is: Movie is amazing! It's one of those movies you can watch with your wife, kids, parents, girlfriend, brothers, sisters, friends ... it's filled with comedy, \"cute action\", few drama moments and nice, captive ending to all of it. It produces one nice message by the end and I know that anyone who watched the movie felt something by the end. I, honestly, can't wait for the sequel and I hope it'll be at least as half as good as this one - even if it doesn't, I will enjoy it for sure."

        "review_detailed_main": "Have you ever felt like a disappointment to everyone you know? Someone your parents and peers think of as an anchor dragging the rest of them down or as a mere inconvenience? How do you get past that?\n\nBerk is a small, Viking village located near the Arctic Circle. At least, that's an assumption I made based on the main character's statement that \"it snows nine months of the year and hails the other three\". That main character, Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) is the only son of the village chief, Stoick the Vast (voiced by Gerard Butler). The village is under near-constant siege by outside forces. Those outside forces being dragons. Hiccup (Baruchel) is short, slim, and in no way strong. The one trade all villagers learn in their lifetime is the art of hunting and killing dragons. Gobber (Hiccup's employer and the proprietor of the village armory, voiced by Craig Ferguson) suggests that Hiccup stop all of \"this\" while gesturing to all of him. Gobber (Ferguson) is a man who has lost several limbs over the years, all during encounters with dragons. Hiccup, being seriously lacking in physical strength, designs and constructs a machine to propel the weapons that the other villagers simply throw by hand. Of course, during a trial run in front of Gobber, the machine strikes a villager. Hiccup takes that same apparatus to a mountaintop, fires on one of the few species of dragon that's never been captured or seen and, miraculously, causes that dragon to fall to earth. Overjoyed by this victory, Hiccup shouts in triumph but is soon set upon by a species of dragon that can breathe fire and produce fire throughout its entire body. He's rescued by his father who expresses disappointment in his son and disbelief in Hiccup's claim to have landed a blow against a Night Fury. He treks through the woods the next day, determined to find proof of his accomplishment, but finds something far more significant.\n\nNow, unlike a lot of \"adults\" I maintain my affection for \"children's\" movies. This is not to say that I like all, or even most, children's movies. For example, Despicable Me, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, and Eight Crazy Nights disappointed me to a degree that I cannot express in words. But, in spite of its flaws or maybe because of them, I loved How to Train Your Dragon. Casting Baruchel as Hiccup was genius. Hiccup's peers, voiced by Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, America Ferrara and others, fit the roles they're given perfectly. If you have children who haven't seen this movie, you should take steps to remedy that. If you don't have children but can enjoy movies that are produced for them, like I do, check it out."

        "review_detailed_main": "How to Train Your Dragon is about a young Viking, and son of the town's leader Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler), named Hiccup (Jay Baruchal) who has no perceivable skills that learns how to create a friendship with a dragon. His journey starts as he attempts to kills his first dragon, but instead, ends up taking pity on the creature and then nurses it back to health. He teaches himself about the dragon race and applies it to the dragon that he affectionately names Toothless. The pair then take Hiccup's friend Astrid (America Ferrera), who believes that Toothless is dangerous, on a little ride to teach her about the dragons. They then find an alpha dragon that terrorizes all of the others in the area. After some time, the alpha is taken down and all the townsfolk believe that they too can become friends with dragons.The story is about creating friendships in the most unlikely places.\n\nAfter Hiccup takes down Toothless with a catapult and finds him in the woods, he realizes that he can't just kill the creature. He lets him go, but then finds him later on and figures out that Toothless can no longer fly correctly. This fuels his compassion for the dragon and thus starts the friendship. As time goes on, Toothless reciprocates this by protecting Hiccup from multiple perceived threats, such as Astrid or the other dragons. Toothless and Hiccup always have each other's backs and they help teach others that it's possible to create friendships between two species. Movies with similar themes include Guardians of the Galaxy, Bolt, and Shrek. All are family friendly, and show that friendships can be created over many mediums and that they are very powerful.\n\nOne technique that was very relevant to the film was the use of montages. This helped to show the development of a friendship between Toothless and Hiccup. It also demonstrated how Hiccup learned about the different quirks of dragons and their usefulness in creating trust. Another useful technique was the use of color. Because of how bright and colorful the movie was, it kept children's' attention throughout the movie. It also added a useful effect for many scenes. When Hiccup was working with Toothless, everything was nice, bright, and used colors like green to convey a happier tone. When Hiccup was with his training partners, everything seemed to be brown and bland except for the dragons themselves. When getting into contact with the alpha dragon and in the fighting scenes, the color was dark, with a lot of grays and black. From montages, to the use of different color schemes, this all helped to show that friendship can be created in the most unlikely places."

        "review_detailed_main": "Here's yet another great film that I missed the boat on initially. I typically stay away from kid's movies (save classic Disney) because they tend to be overly simplistic bores that would only entertain the youngest of children. HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON is one of best of the lot, however, because of its excellent animation and a compelling story with themes that will resonate with viewers of all ages. The movie takes place in an indeterminate time period when Vikings and dragons coexisted, although not peacefully as the beginning makes perfectly clear. They're mortal enemies, in fact, and Vikings train from a very young age to be able to kill the beasts who raid their village and steal their livestock. Everyone, that is, except Hiccup. Hiccup is what you could call an outcast or a reject. He wants to join his peers in training, but nobody ever seems to want to give him a chance. Fortunately, he gets one, though not in the way you'd expect. As the title indicates, there is some dragon training that goes down, but not without a serious paradigm shift. At its core, this movie is about a young boy who doesn't quite fit in, yet finds a way to make himself valuable to the people around him. There is also a subtext about learning to empathize and/or come to terms with things that we don't understand, and therefore fear. Both of these messages are very pertinent to people, young and old, and are dealt with in a mature, yet accessible way. For the kids, you have the spectacle of expertly animated flying sequences and a killer battle with the big-bad dragon. For adults (and more discerning children), you have the meatier stuff about acceptance and overcoming your fears. It's really one of the best animated films I've ever seen, on multiple levels. While DreamWorks might have made their name with Shrek, I think that this will have a bit more staying power in years to come. In fact, this is so good that it pains me to even gripe about a single thing, so I'll make it brief. The setup of the movie is a bit roughly handled, and the characters (initially) aren't really given their due. But the movie improves drastically as it progresses, so much so that you almost forget the slightly weak first act. Overall, this is a movie I see myself watching again and again, and I'll definitely be checking out the sequel. Do yourself a favor and go watch this right now. You'll be glad you did."

It was my niece who made me watch the film in the first place, and she's 8 years old, but I actually think I enjoyed it more than her. She still liked it and she watched it again the next day apparently. I also made my mates watch it as well, and they really enjoyed it to. I can't see why some people give really bad reviews about this, because I think it's amazing animation. I still don't think it's better than any toy story's or shrek, but I still think its amazing. The story line is about a boy called Hiccup, who isn't really good at killing dragons, but he wants to. But when he meets Toothless, the Night Fury, he's not so sure anymore. It's funny, adventure, and really nice film. I recommend this film for every age. I mean, I'm an adult and I enjoyed it, and so did all of my family and friends."

The visuals are outstanding therefore no complaint there.\n\nThe Characters may not be the most original ones, for example the main character being an underdog who wishes to go against the flow of his society in order to do the right thing etc etc, but they serve their purpose in the movie, and that's just fine. The characters are given all the depth they require and the whole film remains unharmed from this element.\n\nThe Children will LOVE this movie. It's energetic, colorful, moving, funny... It has everything. I'm not saying it's masterpiece, but it definitely goes beyond the average animated flicks that Dreamworks previously presented.\n\nThe whole experience, of course, is enhanced by the use of 3-D technology. Moments in the movie will literally take your breath away, especially during the dragon flying scenes, as the audience is given a realistic feel of hovering through mid-air.\n\nBottom line; Go see this movie along with your kids (or even without, it doesn't really matter) and it is guaranteed that you will have a great time!\n\n8/10"

And they loved it...were riveted, even the four year old, who was also fascinated by the 3D spectacles. The scenery in the film was masterfully done, and you COULD feel the 3D essence. The story - not complicated - but an underdog story, and definitely a feel good story. Great ending. Very purposeful, I think. I thought it was the Disney guys (Sanders and DeBois) who did this because I recognized the names, but then thought...wow? Disney let them get away? Ha! Guess the joke's on Disney."

        "review_detailed_main": "Now, before we begin on this review. I'd first off like to say that 99% percent of the time I would pick a Disney/pixar Movie over a Dreamworks flick. This is not the case this movie is a great film, I've seen so many films over the last few years that pride themselves on the fact that there visually stunning. What makes this one so different you might ask yourself. It's the fact that it doesn't pride itself on that. Of course It's a good looking film (hense the 3D effect) but it's the story that really kept me going for 90 or so odd minutes of the picture. I saw this movie with my girlfriend (15) my mom (56) and my nephew(8) and we all loved this movie. I think that this easily is the best Dreamworks movie since the original Shrek. It also has humour and great chemistry between these characters. If your looking to see a good movie this weekend or on cheap night go out and see this and I can assure you that you won't be disappointed I was hesitating at first but now I'm glad I did not wait until DVD release or Illegal download for this flick. It's a masterpiece best movie I've seen since Avatar. (9/10)"

        "review_detailed_main": "So I saw \"How to train your dragon\", from 2010. So is it a good movie. Well the answer is no. O.K this movie is visually stunning, but with the evolotion of CGI, these incredible to look at movies are becoming common place. Also this is a kid's movie, and yeah if I was a small child I might think wow this is awesome, but I am not. There are movies which cross the divide between toddler and adult, for instance the original Shrek or even Shrek II (when the cops found a bag of catnip on puss'n'boots and he says \"thats not mine\" is just awesome). Hell, I even loved all three toy story movies. Granted you could say I have a problem with the kids all having American accents, but even if I accept this because it is a movie, why do the adult Vikings talk with Scottish accents. Shouldn't they sound more like the Swedish chef from the muppets, now that's funny. This story will probably play over well with average people and kids. However, if you are an adult, and don't have a dragon fetish, this is just the same old story about how we don't always know someone, until we get to know them, and a monster is not always a monster. Unless I was planning to do some hallucinogens while listening to pink floyd, while this was on in the background, it is just not worth seeing. If you have a family or are not into truly interesting cinema maybe this movie is your cup of tea. If you are a hipster who enjoys movies like the original shrek, you will probably be disappointed. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "Normally Dreamworks, unlike Pixar, doesn't live up to my expectations. The last Dreamworks movie I had seen for a while was Madagascar 2, which wasn't that great. In my opinion, the best Dreamworks films are Kug Fu Panda, the first Madagascar, and maybe the second Shrek. Other than that, Dreamworks doesn't always score the way Pixar does. Their new movie, How to Train Your Dragon, while having an uncreative name, is incredibly well done in all aspects of an animated movie.\n\nI was amazed at this movie. The movie literally starts with a bang. It jumps right into the action, without the build-up stretching out too long. The action scenes were exciting, and very well-animated. Was it just me, or did the water look SO REAL to you people? Anyway, I really liked Hiccup, the main character. Even though he's different than everybody, and the loser of the tribe, he's quite lovable with his little quirks and his sarcastic humor. When he and the dragon become friends, it had to be one of the sweetest moments I've ever seen in a movie. I left the theater, wanting a dragon of my own! Though I didn't see this movie in 3D, it didn't really matter. I actually had an adrenaline rush whenever Hiccup rode the dragon, Toothless, and swerved between mountain and soared over the clouds. May I add, I thought the dragon was adorable! Another great thing about this movie is that the plot was good; there were no plot holes that I saw. I never got bored, and I never took my eyes off the screen. The humor was great, too, and thankfully, lacking of bathroom jokes. This is a must-see for everyone. If you love sweet, fun, funny, thrilling animated movies, then go see this one. In the future, Dreamworks should look to How to Train Your Dragon when they make their next movie, so they'll have a reference to how an animated movie SHOULD be."

        "review_detailed_main": "I had seen the trailer before i went to the theaters and i had found it quite good (i actually sometimes guide myself from trailers) and worth watching, merely because i found the animation great and i loved how the dragon looked. But i didn't go to the movie theater with any other expectation. God was i amazingly surprised! I couldn't even blink because i didn't want to miss any bit from the film. It was so amazing from start to finish (yeah, from start to finish). I saw it 3d so it was cool, but it is the kind of movie that you don't even realize you have glasses on because the movie carries you with it the whole time. Amazing animation, music, characters, plot and script (yeah i mean that); it was inventive (not the usual dragon stuff). Great directing, character development, funny from time to time and actually very sad in some parts. But there's a word to say it all... EPIC. God this movie didn't lack any sense of epicness, no matter which part of it. My heart was sunken and my eyes wide open the whole film. Yeah, i'll admit the relationship father/son has occurred many times and other things, but what is completely original nowadays in films? One more thing. This film is lovely and fascinating both for kids and adults (although kids might get scared once or twice ;D). It actually has a lot of message of friendship and to take care of animals and nature overall and it is presented in a way not only kids will actually want to take care of them. The flying scenes were superb, with john Powell's score and all (i cant get the score out of my head) and the whole movie overall. But my favorite parts were all when toothless was involved. I mean, when the movie ends, no matter if you are kid or adult, you want that amazing dragon as a pet. Tothless was amazing, and his development with Hiccup is so believable that you are jealous of that friendship. Its animation was amazing and he was so beautiful with his facial expressions and all. You know what? I'll just stop, because i fell i will never finish writing. This is a completely must-see movie and i want it to win the Oscar next year (yeah toy story, you have a superior now, and i dare to say so). How to train your dragon is equally my favorite dream works movie along with shrek (i'm beginning to doubt if i don't like HTTYD more, but shrek is a classic), and makes definitely my top five animated films of all time (well, without the 2d animation) along with finding Nero, shrek 1 and 2 and ratatouille. Masterpiece. No doubt i'm buying these and watch it many times. Very good job!!"

When they mentioned they were making this movie a few years back, I thought that this would suck. But by all means, this is lightyears away from that.\n\nThis is about a a young Viking who befriends an injured dragon that he shot in battle. But as he trains his dragon, he keeps it a secret because he thinks his Viking colony will not approve.\n\nThis is a great voice cast. I recently heard the same director and voice cast are on board for the well-deserved sequel. That bodes a good sign.\n\nThe animation is beautiful. Over the past decade or so, animation has gotten so much better. It's unbelievable. I wish I saw this in 3D, but i did not. Overall, this is one of the best family/animation movies I have ever seen. I rate this film 10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have never really been a BIG fan of Dreamworks Animation. And in saying that, yes, i am not the biggest \"Shrek\" lover. My theory is this......with Dreamworks animated films, the movie always has a spectacular first act, and usually has a pretty decent third act.......but the reason why the third act is always decent is because the second act always sucks. I kid you not, watch almost every Dreamworks animated movie and there is always.....ALWAYS a scene where our main character is walking alone by themselves kicking over rocks in an open field because they feel down about some stupid thing they did. Im sorry, but can we maybe switch it up a little? However, \"Kung Fu Panda\" did give me a glimmer of hope.......hopefully this movie can carry that torch.\n\nFinally, Dreamworks has got it right. They replaced the middle cheesy sequence with an actual storyline. The storyline is nothing above and beyond like PIXAR......but it is very entertaining non the less. The pace in this movie is done very well. Like most Dreamworks movies, i slowly begin to loose interest. But not with this one. It constantly feeds you entertainment with its story, and especially its character drive. Sure it doenst have you laughing non stop, but it replaces those laughs with a genuine story. From start to finish, i never lost interest. And i really think this storyline worked because they followed the same ethics that \"Kung Fu Panda\" and every PIXAR movie does......and that is bringing the movie full circle. Example: through an entire movie, you drop little pieces of a puzzle.......different problems or dilemmas that the main character is facing. Then you drop even more pieces.....pieces that make the main character happy. Then at the very end, the movie fits them all together for you........this movie did a fantastic job of doing just that.\n\nAlso, one thing that i must point out more than anything else is the animation. This is hands down some of the most well crafted animation i have ever seen with my own two eyes. At times, i would literally wipe the drool from my face. Especially the sequence when our main character, Hiccup, takes flight with his dragon for the first time. I was in complete awe at how well it was done.\n\nBottom Line, i will say that \"Kung Fu Panda\" is still my favorite Dreamworks movie......but this is still very worthy of mentioning. It really is entertaining from start to finish, and will produce fun for both adults and children alike. This has set a very high bar for future 2010 animated movies."

My wife told me about How to Train Your Dragon was receiving good recommendations from her co workers, so we decided to see it. After watching the movie, I have to say this is not a good movie, but a great movie to watch for all age groups. Highly recommended and here are my reasons:\n\n1. Excellent character development and story from the get go. The movie makes you care about what happens to the characters as the movie plays out.\n\n2. The 3D effects are used to support the movie scenes by adding details and background environmental effects. The 3D effects are not the star of the show.\n\n3. I have seen the following movies in 3D: Monsters vs Aliens, Avatar, and Up. This one beats them easily in turns of pacing, dialog, story, and entertainment value.\n\n4. 1/4 of the audience were composed of kids in my watching of the show. I definitely heard a few kids calling out the characters' names during the tense times of the movie. As an adult, the movie makes you feel what it is like to be a kid again. Pure fun for the whole family.\n\n5. Vikings and Dragons. If any of these subjects appeal to you then it is a must see movie.\n\n6. Its worth the full price of admission to see How to Train Your Dragon. Best time we had at movies in over a year.\n\n7. Only minor negative comment is the movie is 98 minutes long (kind of short). But since my eyes were glued to the screen, the movie feels like a 2+ hour movie (which is a good thing for me or I feel ripped off)."

        "review_title": "This is a practically perfect movie, and an instant classic!",
        "review_detailed_main": "After several years' interval I watched this movie again on our DVD copy and, just like the first time around, I loved this. I rank it along with Inside Out, Up, Wall-E, and Toy Story as one of the best animated movies ever made. What do these have in common? It's the combination of a good story to tell; engaging characters to root for; a clever script; and maybe most important, human heart and passion. HTTYD has the advantage of a truly original concept -- I couldn't remember seeing anything like it before. And as far as the story goes, there really isn't a single character in the list that we don't actually like. No villains! Just a conflict between a Viking village and the neighboring dragon population that turns out, in the end, to be all a mistake.\n\nJay Baruchel perfectly captures the adolescent voice of young Hiccup, the misfit son of village chief Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler). Hiccup is an apprentice to blacksmith Gobber (Craig Ferguson) and thus (importantly to the plot) knows how to make and build things. Like his friends, he's trying to fit into the standard mold of a rough dragon-killer Viking, but he's not really cut out for it. He is, however, smart and curious, and that leads him onto a much more important path. His peer group of teens includes pseudo-macho Snotlout (Jonah Hill), fat kid Fishlegs (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), Ruffnut and Tuffnut (T.J.Miller, Kristin Wiig) who'd rather fight with each other than anything else, and of course the fierce Astrid (America Ferrara), who Hiccup would do anything to impress. The hilarious series of training sessions for dragon fighting that they go through are among the best scenes in the movie.\n\nThe best scenes of all, though, are with Hiccup and Toothless, the Night Fury dragon he accidentally netted during the very first scene. Unknown to everyone else in the village, Hiccup sneaks off to the woods every day to train with Toothless so that they gradually bond together into a seamless dragon and rider team. The many flying scenes that go along with this are wonderfully rendered with animation that is exactly as good as it needs to be. The 2014 sequel (How to Train Your Dragon 2) is more lifelike and detailed, but that does NOT mean it's more effective. The essential thing is that the animation in the sequel leaves less to the imagination -- and engaging our imagination is what a film like this should be all about. The only thing that leaves us sort of scratching our heads is that the \"Vikings\" all have Scots accents (but only the adults! The teens speak in Standard American.) Nevertheless, it's so charming that it's easy to give that a pass.\n\nThere are two other things that put this movie over the top for me. One is John Powell's music score, with evocative and versatile Celtic-style themes that actually stick in the mind. The other has to do with all the attention to detail that make the dragons more real and personable -- for example, the lovable way Toothless cocks his ears asymmetrically, or the way he scorches a little circle in the grass before settling down for a nap (a fun homage to the way dogs turn round and round before doing the same). Toothless has the full range of expressions and body language to turn him into a full-fledged personality. All of these add to the richness of texture of the whole story.\n\nThere's hardly a single scene without perfectly timed humor, and the 98-minute run time goes by like the wind with not a single wasted moment. Kudos to directors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders and to the whole crew for making a tightly constructed masterpiece. The one big advantage of seeing it first in the theater was the 3D rendering, which actually had real added value."

I don't feel like going into details about why I loved this film so much: most critics (which I've read after returning home) and other reviewers have done the job better than I could ever do. Suffice to say that characters, animation, art direction and plot are top notch, enough to make me write my first review on IMDb to encourage others to share the experience.\n\nGo take your kids or watch this one by yourself, specially in 3D like I did. It is simply a beautiful, fun and spectacular piece of work!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I have to admit, I didn't know anything about this movie until it started showing here in Manila around a week ago. The 3D version had just opened (if I'm not mistaken) a couple of days later and I invited my niece and nephew to watch with me (and my wife). Seeing how this was a Dreamworks movie (Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, Madagascar), it was likely that I'd watch it anyway... the question is, will it be another Kung Fu Panda (which I rated a 10), or a Monsters Vs. Aliens (entertaining, but not a classic for years to come; or good enough to watch over and over again on DVD; let's face it, for every excellent Dreamworks animation like Shrek or Madagascar, there's a Shrek 2 or a Bee Movie).\n\nSo I read up on reviews on a local website and on IMDb, and I was blown away by their reviews, both from critics and regular movie goers. People were generally pleasantly surprised, and enjoyed the 3D as well. So... I got all excited and had higher expectations all of a sudden.\n\nNow on to the movie. There were so many great things from this movie ---\n\nEntertainment - from a storytelling standpoint, this was up there with the best of Dreamworks animation; there was decent character development whether you empathize with the classic protagonist that's different from the rest of the Vikings or just appreciate the father and son relationship as it goes through the awkward years. The build-up from beginning to the climax was well done. There was much enjoyment all around with acceptable (and only occasional) lulls, and the lessons that can be learned were good and appreciable both from a child's standpoint and an adult's. Overall, How To Train Your Dragon (or some call it HTTYD) is a good blend of comedy, action and sprinkles of drama. After all, don't you want your animation to be a pretty good mix of everything?\n\nAnimation - Breathtaking; the aerial movements, the battles, the effects were all very good; not over the top, but released in appropriate doses needed to make every scene effective, memorable and entertaining. Watching in 3D adds more texture to the surroundings, puts the right amount of action at the right times, and was so generally well done that I hope this would be the benchmark of the perfect blend of cinematography and action using this technology (okay, this is not up there with Avatar's 3D but Avatar is technically live action, not animation). 3D doesn't have to be in-your-face like the old 3D's of Jaws or the more recent not-so-impressive 3D of Ice Age, or sometimes useless 3D used during the otherwise-touching and memorable movie \"Up\"\n\nVoice actors - Okay, that the children/teenage protagonists didn't have the requisite Viking (Scottish- or Irish-like) accents was strange, but if you wave off the inconsistency and suspend your disbelief there, I can understand why some reviews said that the choice of voice actors was just right, and not over-the-top overwhelming that they begin to define the humor, and effectively take over the movie (like Robin Williams in Aladdin or Eddie Murphy in Mulan/Shrek). I was half expecting Gerrard Butler to shout his famous line from 300, but he was all right, too. So I enjoyed that, hahaha.\n\nDragons - maybe I was half expecting the dragons to speak but then again, that would have placed it into a box... a box of the usual Hollywood animation (or even non animation in cases like Dragonheart) crap. So this was good. You could still see it in the actions and expressions of Hiccup's dragon friend, \"Toothless.\" Plus they did a bang up job in portraying many different kinds of dragons. I thought that was quite intelligently conceptualized and implemented perfectly, from the wart-hog looking ones, to the two headed variety, there were plenty of dragons for everyone's enjoyment.\n\nOverall, this is a must-see movie for children and those who, like me, are children at heart. I enjoyed it enough to write a review again, hoping that those who are undecided will be convinced to watch it. Please do watch it, and look for that touching scene near the end between our young Hiccup and Toothless (made my eyes welt up just a little). No regrets in watching this. Even with heightened expectations, HTTYD still blew mine out of the sky. Or should I say dragon-blasted it? :-) Now to try watching it in Imax 3D before Clash of the Titans starts next week."

And, when you watch it, you do not feel like it is a movie. Talking scenes are so sincere that you do not feel like you are actually watching a movie. It makes you believe.\n\nMy most important animation movie credit is, making the audience believe. This is a movie make you believe those legendary creatures. It will definitely make all children -and children souled adults- wonder \"Is there an island named Berk?\" or \"Were there dragons in ancient times?\". It even makes an adult believe it. Probably, just for a second, but for a second, they believe there is nothing named \"impossible\".\n\nPerfect movie. Don't die before watching."

I've only skimmed the series \"Heroic Misadventures\" (on which this film is loosely based) and therefore had no real attachment to this. But I'm a simple soul who likes animated movies, and the animation sure did look pretty.\n\nI was stunned. I can't remember the last time I was this touched by an animated movie. Heck, I don't think I've been this touched by many movies of the \"any\" category. This is a story that touches on so many emotions during the course of its fairly simple plot--always a magic combination.\n\nHiccup is the son of a powerful Viking chief of a little Viking village, but he's scrawny, sarcastic, and suited more for mechanical engineering than plundering and dragon-killing. Everyone makes fun of him, and his father is torn between shame of his son's failings and a powerful need to protect him from danger. Hiccup wants desperately to fit in, and uses one of his creations to shoot down a dragon.\n\nWhich he then is unable to kill. Instead, he tames the dragon, fits his with a prosthetic tail fin (one having been ripped off in the original capture) and secretly helps the dragon \"Toothless\" fly again.\n\nIt's touching, often hilarious, and simply powerful. This is simply a great story that is well-told and well-done with a mix of more static, silly characters and major characters with more depth. The emotions are incredible, and a rather bitter twist at the end completes the journey. The animation is beautiful and the score gorgeous.\n\nI can't wait to see this gem again."

But the kids will hardly recognize the book and the movie as having much to do with each other, beyond \"vikings,\" \"dragons,\" and some of the characters.\n\nWhoever converted the book into a screenplay did a wonderful job. The movie was great (see the other reviews) my only real comment on it was it amused me to hear Vikings with Scottish accents, and American accented kids. But hey, I stayed up late more than one night just to listen to Craig Ferguson talk so I'm not complaining too loudly."

Shows even for mid age adults you can find some entertainment in films like this.\n\nThe story is pretty well written as the focus as you can tell from the title is on the dragon and its owner. The adventure you are taken on will explore their bond together as well as other bonds that comes along the way.\n\nThe graphic visuals are very nice & crisp & it can be a great family flick to watch together.\n\nHonestly I find this movie like a metaphor for having pets like Dogs for an example as theirs many breeds out there with some vicious looking or cute but when you'd imagine when humans first encountered any new wild animals they probably seen them more as dangerous creatures or just annoying pests that they had to slaughter from stealing there food or ruining their crops or maybe kids attacked.\n\nAlong the way some time period ancient humans found the benefits of companionship. Love or protection with having dogs as pets and well this film with the dragons is exactly the same way.\n\nDragons are seen throughout history in every mythologies as dangerous creatures that can fly and shoot fire and thats just how we percieve any creature that is not human looking that may look dangerous.\n\nThis film delves into the personal bond you can achieve if you dont as the saying goes \"judge a book by its cover\" But instead actually try to understand & explore inside beyond their front covers.\n\nI think this film can also be a metaphor for humans in general as different Races views other races or Ethnicities as savages or dangerous & yet if you truly try to show compassion with friendship you may realize they are much more then what you see them as. They can probably even repay your kindness & help you back in ways you never dreamed.\n\nOverall I was very moved by this films bond between the owner & dragon. All pet Owners will very much appreciation for this film in my opinion."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's no fun writing good reviews about movies that are commonly seen as good, or the other way around. It feels pointless, like repeating the obvious. But sometimes people seem to be mesmerized by the look-alikes and simply forget what it is to deal with something truly original and precious. So when i first saw How to Train Your Dragon back in 2011, i didn't find it necessary to say anything: anyone with eyes and ears would've understood everything without help from aside. Or so i thought. But after the excitement and praise the HTTYD's sequel received in 2014, with some even claiming that it surpassed its predecessor, it got obvious that eyes and ears are not enough: only with your mind and heart open you can feel the movie's \"soul\" if it has it, or notice its absence if it doesn't\n\nSome details of the original movie might've faded in memory with time. But a single re-watch made them all vivid again. And, the most important thing, brought back that magical feeling that made me instantly fall in love with this movie back in the day. As if you are transferred from the cozy modern environment to a world full of scary and dangerous things and creatures, and the only thing that could compare with that fear of unknown is the curiosity and eagerness to finally find out the secrets it contains.\n\nBut HTTYD is more than just about exploring the unknown that's around you. It's also about the search of your own true self, about questioning the stereotypes based on fear and, above all, about kindness and compassion, and how such things can actually change the set order of things.\n\nThe protagonist named Hiccup, is a nerdy and tiny son of the gigantic and brutal chief of the Viking tribe, people who may pray the Norse gods but whose true god is strength and toughness. Being a total failure in his people's eyes, he desperately tries to prove himself worthy and to kill a dragon, only to find out, when he finally gets a chance to, that his heart goes against it. And so begins a story of a person who, in the world where people are taught to kill first and ask questions later and nobody bothers to think whether it's right or wrong, decides to take a different path. Which leads to things like accepting who you really are, standing up for it and finally making a difference. And finding things that you were so desperate to find, like love and approval, along the way.\n\nIn the world ruled by the machismo stereotypes, it's especially refreshing to see movies where silly and clumsy characters who, on the other side, have a soft and kind heart, may actually save the day and even be sexy. The same approach worked brilliantly in another Dreamwork's gem, Kung-Fu Panda.\n\nBut the magical spell would not be complete without amazing visuals and a truly beautiful score. Seriously, unlike the sequel's soundtrack that was borderline annoying, so excessively vigorous it was sometimes, in HTTYD we have a great mix of a whole variety of themes, from suspenseful to gentle to cheerful to really epic and fist-clenching, each of them perfectly complementing the actions we see on screen. And the scenes of Hiccup and Toothless just flying in the sky, free from everything that confined them on the ground... That was just an indescribable experience that only HTTYD and Avatar ever managed to deliver. As if you're up in the sky yourself, gliding through the clouds with no care in the world...\n\nAlas, all the fairy-tales are bound to end sooner or later, and this movie was no exception. Still, i'm utterly grateful to the team behind HTTYD for creating something that, even for an hour and a half, turns you into a child again and lets you feel the magic long gone from our own reality."

        "review_detailed_main": "The new Dreamworks 3-D (the type with 3-D glasses) animation, How to Train Your Dragon, takes place in a Viking village. Over centuries, man and dragons have been enemies. Dragons kill people, take livestock, and burn their villages, while men have been trained to slay them. Stoick (Gerard Butler) is the leader of the clan, a master dragon slayer, and the protector of the village. To his disappointment, his son, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), is the complete opposite of him\u2014timid, scrawny, and more brains than brawn. One day, using his engineering skills, Hiccup manages to capture a very rare type of dragon. Instead of slaying him, Hiccup lets him go and a secret friendship develops between them. Meanwhile, his Dad is also training him to be a dragon slayer.\n\nDespite what may sound like the usual generic Hollywood-type plot, the story is quite solid and characters are complex. I was constantly guessing how things were going to end up, despite guessing it'll probably be a happy ending, possibly\u2014there are many ways the film could've gone. There were many rooms for laziness in the plot, but I loved how they didn't do that\u2014things were constantly getting more interesting. The dialogue is very witty, with plenty moments of good irony.\n\nThe flying scenes are, to put it simply, spectacular. This film shows why 3-D matters and I felt it really pushed the envelope, technically. The 3-D aspect in Avatar was accomplished, but the 3-D truly flourishes in this film. Few films make me feel like I've actually \"been there.\" This film does just that. I often worry about 3-D action scenes, fearing speed blurs will make it look odd\u2014no worries here.\n\nAll the villagers feel real, emotionally, and are quite complex. The voice work by Jay Baruchel and the animation of Hiccup has so much layer and subtleties that I had forgotten I was actually watching animation. Character design-wise, Pixar may still have a slight edge in terms of everything looking \"marketable,\" but this is very solid work, and most of all, everything works so amazingly well together\u2014plot, characters, music, and technology. Some of the dragons do indeed look a little odd, but they serve the story. I loved all the adult Viking characters\u2014with their Scottish accents, huge beards, and the big warrior mentality--they're as fun as animation can make them. The relationship between Stoick and Hiccup is poignant, subtle, and more real than many live-action films. Gerard Butler's voice work for Stoick bring a lot of weight to the character.\n\nOverall, this film is an amazing showcase for the potential of 3-D. One must think, while 3-D is cool, the whole idea of 3-D is all about \"being there,\" it's not about merely watching two people talk, but about audience involvement. It's about going places where you can't go, doing things you normally can't do. I can imagine the application toward video games can be the next big thing. Meanwhile, this film is not only an accomplishment in the use of this new medium, but good story-telling, and fun characters. I give How to Train Your Dragon, *** \u00bd out of **** stars.\n\nFor more of my reviews you can follow me on http://twitter.com/d_art"

I read the book and really enjoyed it, as well as the film.\n\nUnlike the original book, the film starts with a war between the Vikings of Berk and dragons. And during a dragon attack, young Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III bought down a legendary \"Night Fury\" dragon with a bola-gun. Upon finding the dragon, Hiccup was about to kill the beast, but he couldn't bring himself to it. Hiccup's father enrolls him in dragon-slaying training classes, but Hiccup struggles with the idea of killing a dragon. After training, Hiccup finds the Night Fury again trapped in a small canyon. Soon, Hiccup notices that the dragon's crash landing ripped off one half of its tail wings, leaving it unable to fly. Trying to make things right, Hiccup slowly gains the dragon's trust and names him Toothless, though his teeth retract back into his gums when he's not eating, so he appears \"toothless.\" As the two continue to learn about each other, Hiccup constructs an artificial tail and saddle for Toothless, enabling him to fly again, but only with Hiccup's aid.\n\nToothless teaches Hiccup more about dragons, revealing that they are not the monsters people think them to be. Will their friendship last? Well, you will have to see the film for yourself. So overall, I really loved this film from beginning to end."

The overly animated dragons and the fantastical elements of the movie felt too far-fetched, detracting from my overall enjoyment. I understand the appeal of such animation for a younger audience or fans of fantasy, but personally, I found it to lack a sense of authenticity and connection.\n\nAdditionally, the sci-fi aspects of the movie, though creative, were a bit too pronounced for my taste. The blending of mythical creatures with a Viking world, though innovative, felt more like a distraction than an enhancement to the story. It seemed to tread too far into the realm of fantasy, missing a grounding element that could have made it more relatable.\n\nIn conclusion, How to Train Your Dragon, despite its popularity and acclaim for animation, didn't quite hit the mark for me. Its heavy reliance on fantasy and less realistic graphics made it less appealing, resulting in the low rating. The film is likely to be a hit with audiences who enjoy animated adventures and sci-fi elements, but it wasn't my cup of tea."

        "review_detailed_main": "Like all of Dreamworks' animated films, you can pretty much predict every moment of How to Train Your Dragon from the film's opening sequence. In particular, the whole relationship between the father and son in this picture is so banal I had to roll my eyes every time the father character (voiced by Gerard Butler - for some reason, the major adult vikings in the movie all have Scottish accents) appeared on screen. So I have to admit that I enjoyed this movie a heck of a lot. And even after several days, my happiness with it has not diminished. I think most of that has to do with the relationship between the protagonist, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), and the dragon, Toothless. What can I say, I'm a sucker for any story about a person's relationship with their pet, and with the dragon so cat-like, the film was pretty much irresistible. The dragons are all fantastic, and the film truly comes alive whenever any of them (and especially when Toothless) is on screen. But, really, Dreamworks has never done better with their film-making. They've created a nice little world here. It has a texture and a beauty not before seen in Dreamworks animated features (though still a good deal below Pixar's last two films). Their last few films have had really well done action sequences, and Dragons keeps up with that quite nicely, putting the similar dragon flying sequences in Avatar to shame. DeBlois and Sanders previously directed Disney's Lilo & Stitch (pretty obvious when you compare Toothless's design to Stitch's), which has a similar charm."

        "review_detailed_main": "I went to this movie because I love dragons, and I was hoping it would do the much-abused \"dragonrider\" genre a good turn.\n\nI was not expecting *this.* This is something else entirely. This is a gorgeously wrought, stunningly good movie by any standards. I'm a college student, and I spent half of the movie with my mouth hanging open and the other half with a huge stupid grin plastered to my face. Here's the breakdown:\n\nVisuals: the flight scenes by themselves are more than worth the price of admission. I'm not a big fan of 3-D, but this one time I think the extra depth really added to the experience; it didn't feel gimmicky at all. All I can say with regards to the designs and flight is: *somebody* did their research, and that somebody ought to get a medal. They got it *right.*\n\nCharacters: enjoyable and funny. I didn't mind Hiccup's voice at all; it really fit his character. The side characters are well developed and the conflict between Hiccup and his father is unusually well presented.\n\nScore: stands out! Excellent use of...bagpipes? I've been listening to it nonstop since I saw the movie.\n\nPlot: straightforward enough, but with a few really excellent twists that I won't spoil. Suffice it to say, the ending is very brave indeed and excellently done; I wasn't expecting it in the least but it makes the movie stunningly real. Bravo, Dreamworks.\n\nEmotional connection and real heart? Yes, yes a thousand times over. I didn't realize how badly I needed a truly great dragon movie until I saw this.\n\nThe bottom line: right up there with the very best of Pixar...dare I say with the very best of film-making, regardless of medium? Yes, I think I do. Welcome to 2010, everybody."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"How to Train Your Dragon\" is a surprisingly great film. It has emotional story-telling, a great cast, beautiful animation and a story which can excite any movie-goer.\n\nWhen I first heard of \"How to Train Your Dragon\" I think we all had the same thought, another cheesy dragon film that is just another excuse to make a movie about dragons. Now lets be honest some the more recent dragon films haven't been what any one would call \"good\". However this movie isn't like the others. It's kinda like a talent show you always save the best for last and I'm guessing that's what the film-makers did. I was strangely moved by this film which truth be told no film has ever moved me like this one before. When I took my nephew to see it I had no idea I would be walking out from a truly beautiful film.\n\nIn summary the story is about a boy named Hiccup who wants to be a dragon killer like his father and the Vikings in his village, however he isn't really the fighting type in the eyes of his people. So now he wants to prove himself to his father and his people by killing the most powerful dragon to ever cause trouble for his people. When he succeeds in capturing it he couldn't kill it. So he learns from it and other dragons that all is not what it appears to be. The only problem is convincing his people of that and learning what mysterious threat is causing the dragons to act the way they are and hopefully start a new and better age for the dragons and his people.\n\nThis film dives into the commonly used element of father and son, we all see how he wants his father to see him as a Viking and someone great and the way it comes out is surprisingly heart-touching. It doesn't matter whether its in 3D or not. I haven't seen it in 3D and I don't care about it because I enjoyed this film a great deal without it. So no matter what you see it in you will enjoy this movie. Thanks to moving story-telling, a great performance by the actors, and beautiful animation fire has been breathed into the once almost dead dragon movie genre."

I think most people in the theater wanted to adopt one of the dragons! Next, I thought the music was very good, and some of John Powell's best work. While putting in some ethnic inspired themes, he added his own amazing flair into the score that truly brought this film to the next level. Gave me goosebumps from the opening scene! Finally, I thought that the animation was outstanding and very well done; plus the addition of 3-D really brought out the effects of this film that rival the 3-D work in Avatar and Alice in Wonderland! All in all, a very good piece of work worthy of an Oscar!"

The script, the screenplay, the music, and the characters all culminated into an artistic show which is more than the sum of its parts.\n\nThe 3D actually made it better (I saw it in normal 3D, since I remembered Imax 3D made my head hurt). InTru3D really shines in this, since the characters and background vistas don't seem like cardboard cut-outs, as it did with Avatar's Imax 3D.\n\nAlso the flying sequences were spectacular. You actually felt you were flying with Hiccup and Toothless. The depth the 3D gave to the clouds and both the characters was incredible.\n\nI personally think Dreamworks' How To Train Your Dragon will give Pixar a run for its Oscar, since I believe it's better than Up and just as charming as Wall-E.\n\nIf you haven't seen it yet, please do. You won't regret spending an hour and a half, in the world of Dragons."

The animation is beautiful (especially the flying scenes, the varied Dragon breeds and Toothless's facial expressions) but the storyline matches it... the evolution of Hiccups relationship with Toothless and the Viking clans relationship with ALL dragons, is perfectly done - never rushed, never forced and never kiddish/sickly (it's not all plain sailing).\n\nI won't go into too much detail in case you've not seen it but watch.... whatever your age. If you're a kid, you'll love it. But if you're an adult (or a grown up kid, like me), you'll appreciate the animation, the adventure, the characters, the lovely story. Be a kid again, enjoy.\n\n(P.S.

Than a week or two earlier, i took my young cousin to see How To Train Your Dragon. I was quite skeptical about it. I thought it will be very boring and completely childish. And it is childish. But still, there is something about it that makes it more than just watchable for the adult's, too. I really, really liked. The story is beautiful but simple. The voice over's are great and the Dragon's are characterized brilliantly. All in all, this is a brilliant cartoon that i'm definitely gonna see again, with or without my cousin!

        "review_detailed_main": "Anybody who says they're too old to watch an animated movie needs to get their head out of their ass. The animation creates endless amounts of possibilities, and makes the movie so stunning that we are immediately drawn into their world. But it can also create stories that live-action movies can't. How could you make Toy Story with people? Put a cowboy hat on Tom Hanks and put wings and a helmet on Tim Allen? I don't think so. How to Train Your Dragon is another movie that could only be made through the magic of animation. It has heart, intelligence, and humor that some live-action movies could only dream of.\n\nHere is the plot summary from IMDb.com: A hapless young Viking who aspires to hunt dragons becomes the unlikely friend of a young dragon himself, and learns there may be more to the creatures than he assumed.\n\nThat's the plot, but this isn't a movie about plot-it is about the relationship between a young boy and his dragon. If you've ever had a dog or a cat that you were close to, then this will definitely remind you of it. Like when he scratches the dragon's chin and it falls to the ground in ecstasy; when the kid shines a light on the ground and the dragon tries to catch it; or when the dragon brings a dead fish for the boy to eat. They have the best kid-pet friendship since My Dog Skip.\n\nI would very much recommend this film to anybody. The kids will like it for its cool animation, light comedy, and charming story; but an adult will like it because it is smart, deep, emotional, and very funny. It has some very subtle dirty moments, and I'm pretty sure I heard the f-word a couple of times. Just go see it, you definitely won't regret it.\n\nCheck out my movie review site, where I review new, classic, and independent movies.

The jokes were hilarious\u2014I'm still laughing.\n\nAnd the music! I'm surprised more people aren't talking about the music. This may just be one of the best movie scores of our time. Whether or not it will be fully appreciated when showcased in a family film is in doubt; but, hey, you can only shake your fist at life's unfairness for so long. Not only does the score perfectly compliment each scene (I really don't think it was ever off, even a second!), it's breathtakingly beautiful. It is definitely worthy of an Academy Award nomination.\n\nThis film has a wonderful tenderness to it, and it is just plain joyful! Thank you, DreamWorks!"

Yes, the story itself is familiar, but the magic is in the interactions of the characters and their emotional journeys, not in the narrative itinerary. Also, unlike most of Dreamworks' current output, there is a delightful lack of pop culture references and bathroom jokes. The animation is beautiful and lush, from the characters themselves to the lighting and textures.\n\nThis will likely be an animated classic. It certainly has more of a chance of being so than the serviceable but weakly written Frozen (2013)."

It's a beautiful, charming tale of friendship and trust. I love it. And it's so darling. I love the fact that they combined the Disney character of Stitch with a cat, into a scaled protagonist. It's such a lovely combination. Man I love this movie. It's so precious and endearing."

        "review_detailed_main": "Like many other representatives of the genre, \"How to train your Dragon\" shows sweet characters, which generate a loud \"Ooohh\" among many younger, and also some older viewers. But \"How to train your Dragon\" stands out from other genre representatives through many elements. On the one hand, the film tells a story. This sounds trivial, but if you take a closer look, the majority of the animated films unfortunately lack a story. On the other hand, the young main character Hiccup is finely portrayed and the relationship with his father adds a beautiful meta-level to the film. In addition, the film delivers well-timed humor in the dialogues and a rousing soundtrack. And even if, for example, the depiction of Toothless follows other genre models, he still remains adorable and does not become a kitsch figure. So it is also this fine balance, which, among the other points mentioned, makes the film entertaining for the little ones as well as for the big ones, and that makes a great animated film for me."

        "review_detailed_main": "\u00a8 You sir are playing a dangerous game! Keeping this much raw viking-ness contained. There will be consequences! \u00a8 The creators of Lilo and Stitch, Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, bring us this beautiful animated film called How to Train Your Dragon. I had a chance to see it in 3D and it was stunning! I am surprised at how fast animation is advancing these days because the visuals were as good as Avatar in my opinion. The scenes where the dragons are flying over the spectacular landscape are just amazing. This film is not just about the animation, it also has a great story and memorable characters. The movie is based on Cressida Cowell's novel while directors DeBlois and Sanders contributed by adapting the screenplay making this a fun film for the entire family to enjoy. How to Train Your Dragon has a lot of heart, which is strange for a DreamWorks film. This one might have a chance at beating Disney in the Oscars for the animated category next year. The music in this film is also great; John Powell has already worked in several other animated films such as Ice Age, Bolt, Happy Feet, and Kung Fu Panda so he has great experience in this area. How to Train Your Dragon has raised the bar for the next animated films to come out this year and it will be very hard to top it, and yes I know Toy Story 3 and Shrek 4 are also coming out this year, but they will have big shoes to fill.\n\nThe story takes place in an island up north named Berk where big and strong Vikings inhabit the land. These Vikings hunt dragons because they see them as a danger to their town. Hiccup is a young boy who dreams of slaying dragons, but his small physique doesn't help him in this endeavor. However, he is a great inventor and he has designed a machine that is able to launch a net that can trap dragons in midair. Despite of his brilliant creation the rest of the tribe do not pay attention to him, not even his father, Stoik the Vast, who just happens to be the village leader. He is disappointed in his son because he is nothing like the other kids, so Hiccup is always trying to prove himself. One night he tries his new invention and ends up trapping a dragon. His father doesn't believe him so he decides to go slay the dragon himself and prove to everyone he is a true Viking. The only problem is that when Hiccup reaches the dragon he can't kill it and ends up freeing him. Stoik decides to send his son to a Viking school where they teach small Vikings how to slay these terrible beasts. Hiccup ends up finding the dragon he freed and discovers that these creatures are not as frightening as everyone else believes. He begins a friendship with the dragon which he names Toothless (he was actually inspired by Stitch) and he begins to master how dragons think and act so slowly he becomes one of the best students in school. The problem is that Hiccup must now teach his fellow Vikings that these animals can be domesticated before it is too late.\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon is a movie you have to go see with the entire family because adults and kids will enjoy it alike. It is also a film which is worth watching in 3D because the visuals are just incredible and at moments it feels like you are actually the person flying on the dragon's back. When I first saw the trailer for this movie I really wasn't expecting much from it and I didn't like the title either, but after hearing good reviews from this movie I knew I had to go see it and it was worth the while. I can't comment on the vocal performances because I watched this film in Spanish, but the translation was done really well as they usually are in animated films. This is one of those movies where some of the characters will stick with you in the same way Buzz and Woody did in Toy Story. The technological advances in animation from that film to this one are just astonishing. I still consider The Lion King and Up to be my favorite animated films, but this one will remain a very memorable one as well and hopefully some good sequels can be made. This is a movie I recommend you to see in 3D! You won't want to miss it."

In the film, he described the acceptance of the difference of a child who lost his mother, who was born different from other people, who is in constant conflict with his father, who is trying to make himself accepted in that society, with a beautiful friendship. To sum it up, it's a very good movie."

I was watching this with a friend and was able to predict the whole thing and my friend was convinced that I must have watched it multiple times before but I hadn't. This movie just recycles same old cliches already done 100 times in past movies.\n\nThis is why Disney/Pixar is the best company when it comes to animations.

Despite that I'm going to say them anyway. How to Train Your Dragon is a fun and heartwarming movie about a boy and the forbidden friendship he creates with a dragon in Viking Times. It's such a simple plot and has seemed to be done many times however it just seems to work so well in this film its not hard to get pulled in.\n\nThe Visuals are absolutely stunning and magnificent. They are so beautiful and detailed its hard not to fall in love with the setting. The flying scenes are just spectacular. If you ever get a chance to see it in 3D jump on that opportunity.\n\nThe voice acting is honestly very well and sometimes extremely funny. I love Jay Baruchel's quirky voice that really doesn't sound like an 11 year old boy, but works so well.\n\nThe Visuals are enhanced by the epic score backing it up. John Powell, the composer, is an extremely talented arranger and composer he really makes the movie with his soundtrack of brilliance that almost reminds you of the magic of Harry Potter and the epic-ness of Jurassic Park.\n\nThis movie is amazing and it is probably one of my favorite animated films ever and I would suggest it to those of you looking for a fun movie with lots of atmosphere."

However, 3D films are terrible if they don#t have a great storyline behind them because then they just turn out like 2012, loads of effects and not a lot else, aka Rubbish. Luckily HTTYD has a great story line, the traditional unpopular protagonist who overcomes something or other by alternative methods and saves the day, with plentiful lashings of viking-esquire styling to boot. The plot is good fun and quirky with a good ending and the flying scenes appeal to myself greatly, although that might be due to the fact that dream about such things. The 3D aspect of the films is a little under par in my opinion but not to the point that it is bad, it is just I have scene 3D done better. There are a couple of surprise actors, namely Gerard Butler (300), which where a welcome surprise and gave that film a familiar dimension which helped in some way or another. Either way, it is was fun to watch and an enjoyable side to a nice packet of crisps."

No spoilers here, though!\n\nOnly negative about this movie is Jay Baruchel's voice as Hiccup. He has an annoying voice in general, WHY WHY WHY would you cast him in an animated movie? Obviously he couldn't pull off any sort of accent, as he had none. Just a bad choice for the lead role.\n\nAll in all- great story, AMAZING visuals, might seem scary for some kids 9/10"

At first, I was really hesitant to watch it because I thought the title was a bit lame but when I saw that it was on IMDb's top 250 list, I decided to give it a shot. I don't regret it.\n\nIt is just spectacular. This film has the right amount of comedy, drama and action. The animation was fantastic. The film portrayed anti-violence, bravery and the value of animals (even if in this case dragons). It is a perfect family film. It could teach children a lot.\n\nAlso, the ending was just perfect. It gave the right amount of happiness, loss and warmth. It was amazing.\n\nDefinitely a must-see. Just wonderful."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have a friend in the area who lost his hand in a wood chipper a little over a year ago. His recovery and return to life have been nothing short of miraculous. A determined will, a strong faith in God, an incredibly supportive wife, encouraging friends and family created the perfect environment for him to recover and eventually become functional with a prosthetic. Just a year later and he is back at work as a doctor, has played golf, returned to biking, and enjoys a host of other activities that he did prior to the accident.\n\nHowever, the first time I was around him with his new hand was slightly jarring for me. I was surprised, but I could not remember a time in which I was around someone with a prosthetic. Fortunately, my friend appears comfortable with his new hand and understands that it takes a period of time for others to get used to it. His goal is to move to a new hand within the next year that has the dexterity to pick up a quarter. Knowing him and his support group, I'm sure he'll make the adjustment just fine.\n\nUnfortunately, most pictures of prostheses in movies and books are not so positive. From Capt. Hook to Candyman to the Fugitive, rarely are amputees seen in a positive light. There are a few inspirational movies here and there but the stereotype remains.\n\nThat was why I was so surprised when I took my family to see \"How to Train Your Dragon.\" The movie has not one but three characters with prosthesis and all are portrayed in a positive light. The way the creators do that is by presenting the characters as leading normal lives. Each finds a way to make life work with their new hands, feet, and wings. Each shows a wonderfully determined attitude to continue despite their setback. Each finds a way to be happy.\n\nGranted, I'm sure folks with prosthetics go through a variety of emotions that I can not fathom. I'm also sure that not everyone's experience turns out as well as my friend's or the characters' in the movie. But I do think it is important to show positive pictures of folks with prosthetics that seek to lessen people's fears and inspire others. Aside from being an entertaining movie, \"How to Train Your Dragon\" does just that.\n\nFull review found at the Raleigh Examiner http://bit.ly/cNbRE1"

My only complaint is that it should have been longer- more time to develop the background and other characters. But overall, a great movie.

And while I'm sure you won't be able to tame a dragon after you watch this (first you have to find one of course), it is a very fine movie, that has just a few minor flaws.\n\nAnd even those will not really be seen by most people (as flaws), because they might just not care. It's a movie that is about peace of course, but there still is a big danger. And of course quite a few things might be a bit too simple. Now again, if it weren't for Pixar, I might not even notice or care about those things. But there is Pixar and to make a perfect animated picture has become really hard.\n\nStill very good (hence the rating), so more than worth a look! (Great voice cast)"

They unfortunately choose to make bad movies a little too often, movies that are either lazy, annoying or just full of dumb decisions. However, when they concentrate, when they pour their heart into a project, there is no limit to what they can accomplish. One of the best examples of this is, as you might have guessed, How to Train your Dragon. This is a marvelous demonstration of nearly all the qualities DreamWorks possess. The movie is extremely well paced and set up, and the plot is easy to follow yet intriguing at the same time. The animation is gorgeous and the character designs are amazing. The score is the best of any DreamWorks movie, maybe even the best of any animated movie. The characters are realistic and fairly well fleshed out, even though some side characters don't get a lot to do. The worldbuilding is great and the locations are well utilized, but the biggest strength of the movie is of course the dragons. They come in all variants, all of which are unique and have their own interesting concept and way of attacking. Toothless is of course the one given most attention, and he is in my opinion the single best animal sidekick in any animated movie. His relationship with Hiccup is wonderfully well realized. It's cute and heartwarming while also being the main drivingforce behind the plot. The final battle is super tense and is set up nicely, the ending is heartwarming and leaves a very good taste in your mouth. This is the textbook example of how to make an animated movie great, it's one of my favorite movies of all time and I will continue to think that for a very long time."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you've had one ear and/or one eye open to the media over the past month you've likely heard the masses shouting their accolades for \"How To Train Your Dragon.\" It is the highest rated Dreamworks Animation film of all-time in the realms of Rotten Tomatoes with a staggering fraction of 98% positive reviews. That also makes it one of the most critically- acclaimed films of the year so far. On a similar rave wave, it is currently ranked #174 on IMDb's zesty Top 250 list (just above John Ford's \"The Grapes of Wrath\"). I wonder if that will last...\n\nWith so much praise under it's wings, I went into my 3D screening of \"How To Train Your Dragon\" at the local Cinemark with soaring expectations. They were well met! This is the best product to come out of the Dreamworks Animation factory that I've seen since the original \"Shrek\" nine years ago (that said, I've missed and avoided more than a couple on their menu between then and now). This is one of the best films I've seen this year! But I've only seen four of the films that 2010 has had to offer up to this point.\n\n\"How To Train Your Dragon\" is based on the first in a series of eight books from the mind of Cressida Cowell. This yarn is set in a mythical world where the people are all vikings and dragon-slaying is all the rage. In this particular thread we meet Hiccup, the son of a viking chief. Hiccup does not fit it, and it may have more to do with his different ideas than his different physical make-up. He encounters a wounded dragon in the woods and- I'm not here to tell the story, but hopefully that appetizer piqued your interest.\n\nThis movie suffers from banal characters and situations. While fairly predictable as a whole it still breathes out fiery instances of astonishment and even delivers a powerfully emotional punch or two. All in all, it is one solid piece of entertainment capable of stirring the audience's feeling. You'll surely laugh, probably hold your breath with excitement, and maybe even cry (my date did).\n\nAs aforementioned, I caught the film in 3D (absolutely deliberately) and it was dazzling. It is the most beautiful thing I've seen since... well... \"Avatar.\" This is one feature film well-worth paying a raised admission price for that extra dimension, though I fear the days for such a chance are dwindling if not already doused. I still feel for the seven people on this Earth who never got see \"Avatar\" in all its depth and glory in theaters. They will likely never know what they missed. Some films are surely meant to be seen in 3D, \"How To Train Your Dragon\" is one of them. The dragon-flying sequences in particular are where our recent advancements in technology really shine. Movie moments showcased herein and in the likes of \"Avatar\" prove that CGI and 3D-application can help storytellers immerse audiences on a whole new level. It can work marvels for filmgoing experience. Regrettably, as with all power, it can be abused and used only for show, bringing nothing but nifty trickery for the audience to suck on. And lower still, some \"filmmakers\" are only using these abilities (sometimes as a last minute hack-job) just to get us in the theater seats.\n\nI beseech you all to go see \"How To Train Your Dragon.\" It is the only movie I've seen this year I'd recommend to everyone. You'll see all sorts of these imaginative flying lizards and the film takes careful time to introduce us to a number of them. Not least of which is Toothless, the name Hiccup gives the rare monster he finds one eventful afternoon. It is the relationship between this special dragon and this special young man that is at the heart of the film. It works wonderfully. If I haven't convinced you to see it yet then I haven't done my job, go learn \"How To Train Your Dragon,\" you'll be glad you did."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"How To Train Your Dragon\"- A guide to successful domestication. Or a really awkward title for a porn film.\n\nAs with most films, I went with certain expectations, but all of them, were exceeded as the ending credits rolled out... and made me head down to the nearby adoption center, in hopes of finding a baby dragon. No luck.\n\nDreamwork's latest film is directed by Dean DeBlois & Chris Sanders and written by Cresida Cowell, is voice cast by such stars as Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, America Ferrara, Craig Ferguson.\n\nThe premise?\n\nIn a mythical land, where Vikings favorite pastime activity is hunting fire-spitting pests, dragons, a muscle-ridden teenager by the name of Hiccup (voice by Jay Baruchel) tries to constantly \u0084make a mark\" on the 300 year old war with little or no success. Actually, with no success at all.\n\nUntil one day, he get's lucky, and catches the most feared dragon of all, Night Fury, \u0084the unholy offspring of lightning and death\", and an unlikely friendship develops.\n\nWhat seemed to be playing with fire, turns out to be more like sitting next to it, and enjoying the warmth. As Hiccup is forced into How-to-kill-a-dragon 101, he realizes that \u0084all they know about them is wrong\". Unfortunately, his father Stoick, (voiced perfectly by Gerard Butler) does not share his approach...\n\n\u0084How to Train your Dragon\" is an animated film, full of heart, with a healthy emotional dose, stitched together with thrilling aerial sequences, that put 3D to it's best use \u2013 it puts you, where the action is. And, what's a rare trend in animated films, the film is practically pop-culture free.\n\nThe character designs don't disappoint, but also don't thrill... That is until you see the dragons. Big ones, small ones, some as big as your head. Give them a twist a flick of the wrist, That's what the showman said... Sorry\u0085\n\nThe Dragon's design heavily reflects their personalities - a bumble-bee like dragon is a bit slow on the uptake, while a sleek-designed dragon, like Night Fury, is fast and smart, kinda like a heat-seeking missile). Also, what I really liked about them, is that eventually they turn out to have pet-like behavior. They like being scratched on the back, they get high on blades of grass and if you share a fish with them, they'll love you forever.\n\nThe entire voice cast is a perfect fit for the film's characters. Gerard Butler, with his overpowering, hoarse, deep-throat voice, goes perfectly with Stoick's over-muscular statuesque (Sparta is proud of you!) Jay Baruchel is AMAZING! His voice acting gives Hiccup so much credibility as a boy with unlimited fervor but limited by his surroundings. And then we also have Craig Ferguson voicing Gobber, the village's blacksmith who has a blanket-like quality to his voice \u2013 warm & fuzzy. And there are many more talented voice cameos, who carry themselves quite well throughout the film.\n\nYou can just tell, that Dreamworks tried Pixar's approach... They gave the story a lot of thought and consideration. Like it would be their first and last animated film for which they'd be remembered. Show, don't tell \u2013 it's that simple. \u0084Up\" did it, so can you!\n\nOne bad thing is, that the film seems a bit sequel-ready. No need for future installments to ruin the charm of the first one. Remember \"Shrek\"?\n\nYou will not burn yourself on \u0084How To Train Your Dragon\". Instead you will be pleasantly meant with warmth and understanding, that we can all coexist with each other.\n\nPixar, watch your back, Dreamworks is sneaking up."

        "review_detailed_main": "I didn't bother to watch this movie when it first appeared because I thought they made another 'Lilo and Stitch' out of it. At least, that's what it looked like from the trailers. I probably wouldn't have seen it for some time yet unless I hadn't been on a trans-Atlantic flight and had nothing better to do than watch a movie.\n\nAlthough I was watching it on a 4 by 6 screen with crappy sound, I have rarely enjoyed myself as much as I had with 'How to train your dragons'. Because it has just about everything I look for in an animated film: Funny. This film, unlike many, manages to avoid toilet and slapstick humor entirely, and that is already a huge plus, rare as that is. But the jokes that are in the movie slot into place so naturally, and are so well timed that I don't know of anyone who could watch this with a straight face for more than five minutes. The humor has something in it for everyone: visual gags, puns, word play, allusions... all but the aforementioned toilet/slapstick humor.\n\nClever. Surprisingly enough, this movie is actually original. I don't remember any other movies with a plot even similar (Eragon does not even come close) to this one. Does the movie completely avoid clich\u00e9 situations and is it completely unpredictable? No. But the clich\u00e9s are few and extremely well done at that, and of course it's predictable. It is supposed to be that way. You know what the ending will be like. But at the same time, there are many interesting twists thrown into the plot, what's predictable is cocooned in humor and even some self-irony, and even the ending has a slight surprise which I have never seen before in any movie.\n\nVisuals. If I can be immersed in this movie on a 4 by 6 screen, I can imagine how it would've been to watch this on a theater-sized screen. Mind-blowing would not begin to cover it, especially in 3-d.\n\nShould you watch this? Oh, definitely. Bring everyone you know along as well, because I don't know anyone who would not be at the very least mildly entertained by this movie. It's not my favorite movie, but it's definitely in my top 20 or so. For a very good reason."

Because of the great success of the movie, a sequel should be coming in the year 2014. \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is a suspenseful attention gripping film that invokes emotion and witty humor. This movie knows how to attract the viewer to make him/her feel like they are in the movie, rather than just simply watching it.\n\nOn the island of Berk, everyone is a Viking. The goal, kill dragons. One's superiority is based upon the type and number of dragons killed. The island is full of rock statues that are lit up with fire during the nighttime. At first glance, the island appears spooky but it is quite peaceful when there are no dragon attacks. Obviously, fighting and killing dragons is no easy game. Led by Stoick the Vast (voice actor Gerard Butler), the island of Berk continues to prosper.\n\nHiccup (voice actor Jay Baruchel), Stoick's son, is continuously laughed at by all the local people because of his inability to kill a dragon. One night during a heated battle between the Vikings and the dragons, Hiccup shoots and traps a dragon. Because of Hiccup's weak body and personality, no Viking believes him, not even his own father. Hiccup just wants to fit in with the others and be called a Viking. He is only trying to make his father proud.\n\nHiccup develops a relationship with the dragon he caught just as a person would with a dog. The dragon becomes Hiccup's first friend and he names the dragon Toothless. Toothless is unable to fly without help because Hiccup had shot off part of his tail during the battle. After some time, Hiccup becomes brave enough to fly on top of Toothless and control his flight pattern with the use of a mechanical wing for a tail. The movie does a splendid job at showing the bond between Hiccup and the dragon. Because neither the dragon nor Hiccup trusts each other at the first encounter, the relationship slowly grows stronger and stronger with time. Hiccup continues to keep his pet dragon as a secret knowing that his village would kill it if they saw it.\n\nThe most remarkable thing about \"How to Train Your Dragon\" is the director's ability to attract a wide audience. This movie was originally made for children; rated PG, but anyone can watch the movie and find enjoyment from it. Directors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders planned to make this movie suitable for all ages by creating enough action for children and a strong plot for young and old adults. The script contains a decent balance between action and humor in order to keep the viewer entertained. If a viewer is expecting a gruesome, bloody, action-packed animated film, that viewer will not be satisfied with this movie.\n\nShould this movie be seen? Absolutely! There is no doubt that this movie was well done. This movie allows a viewer to reminisce on their childhood and ponder about the ability to do the impossible. Overall, I would give this movie an eight out of ten. Once again, this movie really shines through with its ability to display the unbreakable bond between a pet and a human. A total of 98 minutes of film, and a couple bucks to watch it; this movie is worth every penny."

Therefore, this is a good movie not thanks to the plot, but because of how it's coated in an innovation veil. Not the plot is what gives this animation a fresh appearance, but the details. They made dragons look so adorable, friendly and helpful, I almost forgot they're not real and started to think during the movie that I should buy me one of those.\n\nA good distribution of the action scenes, comedy ones and emotional ones. Not too much or too little of any of these. Not a very forceful outburst of the climax, but can't complain, either.\n\nI don't quite understand why the name of the main character is Hiccup - even though there is an explanation given at the beginning of the movie, it's not enough for me. But that's just me. These being said, I think 8 is an appropriate mark."

The story is very imaginative and is guaranteed to keep the attention of children and adults.\n\nDuring the flying scenes, with the perfectly-suited Galic music cheering us on in the background, I had tears of purest joy streaming down my face from the, raw, visceral emotion of it. How To Train Your Dragon is not a terrible film. It's funny in parts and looks great in 3D with some really excellent action sequences. However, it's so contrived and forgettable that I really don't think Pixar need to worry. They've still got the animation crown and Dreamworks are showing no signs of grabbing it away from them."

        "review_detailed_main": "My partner and myself both had the same feeling within the first five minutes of this movie starting.....this is going to be bad. Quite dark, loads going on, narration that you couldn't quite hear......then bang!!!!! It properly gets going.\n\nIn brief, Hiccup is a young Viking who doesn't live up to the Dragon Slaying heights that his father would like. Every time he tries, he causes complete mayhem. That is until he meets Toothless, a very rare species of dragon that has never been seen before. This incident would have brought Hiccup the fame and glory that his father so desperately wants his son to have, but instead of wanting to slay and kill the dragon, Hiccup befriends him and finds that all dragons are not what they first seem. What unfolds is a fantastic story of friendship, bravery and courage, and all of this is delivered to your multiplex in absolutely jaw dropping animation and 3D rendering. And I mean jaw dropping. The Viking ships cutting through the water, the clouds, the amazing flying scenes....just fantastic.\n\nI was a huge fan of Pixars UP, a beautiful picture brought to you wrapped in beautiful animation, but I must admit that, for the first time in my opinion, a Dreamworks animated movie more than holds its own against its superior counterpart. Dreamworks have well and truly cracked it with this movie and if they keep with this formula, then their success will be going long into the future.\n\nNow I know that thousands out there will be screaming in Shreks favour but lets be honest, Shrek was mediocre at best and it sequels just milked an already shaky beginning dry. How To Train Your Dragon is by far Dreamworks best animated movie, and also one of the best animated movies made to date.\n\nA total success."

        "review_title": "A great film but better than \"Toy Story 3\"? Really? - 82%",
        "review_detailed_main": "I remember reading, with growing anger, about some dissenting voices during the last Oscar ceremony who were whinging about Pixar claiming the Best Animated Feature yet again with \"Toy Story 3\". They reckoned that this should have got it instead but having seen it, I can't really see what the fuss is about. Don't get me wrong - it does give Woody and co a good run for their money and this is probably the best Dreamworks animation produced so far. But by sticking too closely to the usual story lines these films adhere to, it just falls short of greatness.\n\nYoung Viking Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) has a problem - actually, he has a few. He is a constant disappointment to his father Stoick (Gerard Butler) who is an enormous Viking warrior. He finds the love of his life Astrid (America Ferrera) is way out of his league. But worst of all, his village is plagued by dragons in all shapes and sizes. But after an encounter with a deadly Night Fury dragon, Hiccup quickly finds himself becoming friends with the beast. As time goes on, Hiccup discovers that everything he thought he knew about dragons is wrong but can they work together to combat the village's prejudices and an evil far greater than anyone imagined?\n\nDreamworks do things a little differently to Pixar - for example, they get a stellar cast to do the voices whereas Pixar get the best voices to fit the part. Thankfully, \"How To Train Your Dragon\" has a fairly small cast and they all do justice to the film. With the small cast, they probably had a few more pennies to spend on the animation which is truly beautiful. This is possibly where Dreamworks have the edge over their bitter rivals and honestly, this looks better than some non-animated movies. Water and fire look much wetter and hotter than they did in \"The Last Airbender\" (which damning this film with faint praise) and I understand that the 3D is also much better. For my money, this is the best looking animation I've seen since \"WALL\u00b7E\".\n\nMy gripes, in truth, are fairly trivial but they still distracted me somewhat. As my Scottish wife eloquently pointed out, the Scottish accents shouldn't have anything to do with Vikings from Norway and while I'm on the subject, the fact that adult Vikings spoke with a Scottish accent instead of a Californian accent like the children gave the impression of half-heartedness. The other let-down is the story which is yet another tale about a unlikely hero trying to be something they're not but after being true to himself, finds that he's more powerful than anyone supposed. In short, this is \"Kung Fu Panda\" in a Nordic setting and if that's what you're looking for then great. This is a really good family film, full of all the fun and excitement you could wish for and comes highly recommended. However, I just wanted it to move me like Pixar can and it didn't. But like I said, this is still a very good movie and one which you'll enjoy if you catch it."

The bonding sequences between Hiccup and Toothless are executed to perfection, and I love that they take their time. It takes a while, even in a montage, for these enemies to become friends. It makes their connection feel earned. Coupled with this is Hiccup's growth as a character as he not only becomes more confident, but becomes more thoughtful. Test Drive, in particular, is one of my favorite movie scenes, period. The accompanying track (also Test Drive) is among my favorites as well. John Powell has a lot of great music in this, like This Is Berk and Romantic Flight. The whole soundtrack is iconic. Watching his advancement in Dragon Training was really fun as well. Astrid and his dad come off as a little too harsh, but both of them have great character arcs and completely redeem themselves. The moral here about how hard it is to let go of what you think you know and see things in a new way is really important. It's also beautifully animated, with plenty of action and incredible flight sequences. The only downside is that the animation of the human characters doesn't really stand the test of time."

        "review_detailed_main": "Considering for a moment \"How to Train Your Dragon\" and \"Kung-Fu Panda\" as a kind of couplet for Dreamworks Animation, they seem to be acquiring great skill in hitting these stories well out of the park.\n\nThis is great, solid stuff: Neatly buttoned and compelling storytelling, fine characterization, brilliant voice acting, and very well-done, crisp animation.\n\n\"How to Train Your Dragon\" is full of action - engaging you virtually from the beginning - but it pulls back by presenting you what you don't expect: A son - \"Hiccup\" - of a Viking leader who is more book- and mechanically-smart than brawn. An engineer, a tinkerer, a genius in his own right. And, clearly, he's not destined to be a Leif Ericson.\n\nWhether through happenstance, skill, or fate - you decide - Hiccup captures an \"uncatchable\" dragon, the Night Fury, with a smart little contraption he cooked up. In the process of catching it he goofs the entire effort of the village to fight the swarms of dragons.\n\nRunning off later, he finds the Night Fury, who it turns out was injured by his contraption. Lacking a full rudder - so to speak - He can't take to the sky completely. Hiccup cooks up another contraption that helps him fix the rudder and allows him to ride the Night Fury - now affectionately named \"Toothless.\" Simultaneously he is going through \"Dragon Training\" where he is learning how to kill dragons, but ironically what he is learning from Toothless allows him to best his classmates by learning all sorts of secret moves on the captured dragons they train with - all of which allow him to effectively disable them without hurting them. Hiccup ends up being the village celebrity who can seemingly dominate the dragons without really trying to.\n\nComing home from a quest to find the Dragons' nest, Hiccup's father, a well-voiced Gerard Butler as Stoick, is beside himself with joy at how well his son is doing.\n\nThe story moves on from there from one exciting scene to the next, to the climax, where they battle the biggest dragon of them all.\n\nI won't give the ending away but it's only slightly bittersweet - mostly poignant and not-too-nicely wrapped-up for popular consumption. Suffice it to say even in a war with fictional beasties there is a price to be paid. In the end, Hiccup comes out shining.\n\nThis really is a great, fun, engaging story that will keep you on the edge of your seat. It is not fluffy or silly-for-silly's sake (as, say, the \"Shrek\" series has mostly become). And, even though the action is fairly intense, your kids will very likely love it. It really is a fun, fun story. Don't miss it."

They show where the Vikings live from the ocean view and the ocean almost looks lifelike and with the 3D effect it looks like you are right there on the water.

        "review_detailed_main": "I missed HTTYD in its theatrical release, but being the animation enthusiast that I am, and having heard some positive reviews, I was happy to see the film on DVD. My modestly positive expectations were greatly surpassed.\n\nMy first impression was that the visuals were exceptional; the night shots of the village and the contrast with fire from the dragons' attack was very impressive. The animators managed to do a very good job of rendering the clear, crisp feeling of a cold, starry night. The level of detail was remarkable; textures of rough, weathered wood and battered metal looked very authentic.\n\nThe story is very familiar; essentially \"local goofball makes good\". So, being that we've all seen it before, why is it so good here? That technical excellence helps; this really feels like a world we haven't really seen before, but it's rendered gorgeously. Lush forests are contrasted with forbidding rocky coasts. The characters are great too; Jay Baruchel makes the central character Hiccup sound sufficiently nebbishy, and is ably supported by Gerard Butler as Hiccup's imposing father Stoick and Craig Ferguson as Cobber.\n\nWhen the story opens, Hiccup's home island of Berk is being attacked by marauding dragons. Hiccup is not the most manly of Berk's inhabitants, and is beset by a tendency to daydream. He has created a device that he believes will help bring down the attackers, and sneaks out to try it in battle. It works--Hiccup knows he's brought something down but it lands too far away for him to investigate--but the unintended consequences cause considerable damage. Hiccup's father Stoick is clearly disappointed.\n\nWhen Hiccup goes out the next day to try to find what he might have brought down, he finds a dragon that no one has ever seen before; a dreaded Night Fury. But its tail is injured, and it cannot escape the sinkhole where it landed.\n\nHiccup comes to name his find \"Toothless\", and the relationship they build is central to the film. Toothless is an amazingly-imagined creature who expresses an incredible range of emotions over the course of the story. As Hiccup gains Toothless' trust, he learns far more about dragons as a species than his fellows at home ever knew.\n\nSo, more clich\u00e9, Hiccup befriends Toothless, trains him in secret, and eventually becomes the first human to actually RIDE a dragon. But this process is told so convincingly and beautifully that it comes across very naturally.\n\nThe story has some nice twists, too, like when Hiccup discovers that the dragons are not merely stealing the villagers' food for their own sake.\n\nThere are great messages in the film. The usual \"be true to yourself\" stuff, sure, but deeper ones about trust and loyalty as well. They all come organically out of the story, rather than feeling imposed.\n\nEver since the original Shrek, I knew that Dreamworks could compete with Pixar when they really felt like it. The journey's been uneven but they've continued to produce some very good work on occasion. This movie, though, is maybe the first one that can be considered with Pixar's very best movies. The next Oscars in 2011 may finally see an animated film win as Best Picture; How to Train Your Dragon and Toy Story 3 are both good enough to be contenders. With its dazzling technical merits, its well-written story and its great, original characters, I think I'd vote for the dragons."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hiccup is a viking, the only problem is he doesn't seem to fit in with everyone else. He's scrawny, scared and can't kill a dragon when given the opportunity. Instead, he makes a unique friendship with the one dragon that people never seem to see. He learns that everything he knew about dragons was wrong and he must stop his father and the other vikings from killing more of them.\n\nHow To Train Your Dragon seemed like another animated film that would come and go at the snap of a finger. Yet, it somehow managed to be the best review film of the year (so far) and rake in the cash. Word of mouth spread and along with the critical backing, the film has managed to stay in the top spot for awhile. So I decided to give it a chance. While the film is not as emotionally engaging as other animated films of recent years, it still manages to have fun and entertain.\n\nThe voice acting from all was really well done. I had fun spotting who was who and each one gives their character that unique little bit of spice. Jay Baruchel has whiny brat down to a tee, almost to the point of annoyance. With the exception of America Ferrera, I was able to point out every voice actor, yes even the guy from Cloverfield. Her character, Astrid, who isn't in the book, is the love interest of our lead. She is the tough one who is jealous of Hiccup when he starts to get the spotlight for knowing how to handle the dragons. This relationship is never the focus point and seemed rushed, but I can live with it.\n\nThe animation at times looks marvelous, the fur the vikings wear looks great. At other time it looks a bit weak, specifically the lead dragon. I don't know if it was the stylistic choice of making him look like a cat, but it looked like the weakest part of the animation to me. Which is funny, because the dragon was the best part of the film. Toothless, as he is called, was funny, cute and kick-ass. The scenes in which he is flying with Hiccup were really well done and added the sense of excitement and adventure the film needed.\n\nIt has laughs here and there, but never did I find it overly funny. Instead it plays out the family friendly adventure spin. The story itself is nothing new, young outcast needs to win the hearts of those around him. Finds an unfamiliar friendship and uses it to his advantage. The setting of dragons and vikings was the new angle the film gave us. The relationship between Hiccup and toothless is a nice addition to a spew of films in which the lead character makes friends with an animal.\n\nWhile How To Train Your Dragon doesn't go leaps and bounds over anything else, it is one of the better films Dreamworks has managed to kick out recently. Both adults and kids will enjoy this film."

        "review_detailed_main": "How to Train Your Dragon directed by Chris Sanders & Dean DeBlois is a big budget CGI animation film from the DreanWorks Animation stable.\n\nThe story is set around the ancient & mythical Viking land where the glory of a man lies in becoming a dragon slayer. Dragons occasionally raid the Vikings & take the livestock & any other available food which invariably results in a fight. The protagonist of the movie is Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), son of the chief of Vikings (Gerard Butler). As with any other Viking, Hiccup wants to be a dragon slayer but is constantly discouraged by his father because he is 'different' read not muscular. So at one of the dragon raids, when Hiccup injures a most feared dragon called Night Fury, no one believes him. He goes to the adjacent woods to find & kill it, but when the time comes he couldn't do it because he realizes that it is as much afraid of him as he is of it. So he releases it & an unlikely friendship is forged. Gradually Hiccup finds that dragons are not harmful unless provoked & he tries to change the perceptions of Vikings especially that of his father. With the help of his lady love Astrid (America Ferrera), how he achieves his goal & brings peace between Vikings & Dragons forms the rest of the story. By the way, the intro of Astrid is hot, literally. There are enough action pieces & fights with a lot of . The Big Daddy at the climax looked like a hybrid between T-Rex & Archaeopteryx. Imagine a T-Rex breathing fire.\n\nThe basic structure of the story is not at all new. In fact after watching the movie, you would feel that you seen this kind of a story a 100 times where a misunderstood teenager/kid meets a misunderstood character/animal - they become friends - with the help of allies they make a difference in their surroundings - you know it. So what differentiates such movies? The characters & the settings which are new in \"How to Train Your Dragon\" & what more, they are beautiful. The tale is touching with enough thrills to keep you engaging although in the middle, for a few minutes, you feel that the pace has slowed a bit.\n\nAs far as animation goes, the level of detail is unbelievable. In fact if there are no animated characters in the movie, you would think that the movie is not animated at all. The shadows & the colours are superb adding amazing depth to the animation. Since it's entrance, Pixar has been walking with major revenues as well as acclaim leaving Dreamworks in its trail. With only Toy Story from Pixar in 2010, this got to be one of the leading contenders at the Oscars 2011. Already this has got the highest score for a Dreamworks Animation film at Rotten Tomatoes. Come on DreamWorks, we need some good competition to Pixar. Bring more movies like this.\n\nAll the voice cast is good. I think Gerard Butler is a Viking in his previous birth as his voice somehow suits it well. John Powell's score complements the movie well. Technically a very well made film.\n\nIf you are one of those, who felt cheated after watching the 3D versions of Alice in Wonderland & Clash of the Titans, this movie will not disappoint you. I've mentioned in my Clash of the Titans review to not see it in 3D, but How to Train Your Dragon is a movie which you should see in 3D. The movie is also being screened in 2D version but there is no point in seeing this in 2D. Although the 3D is not as superlative as say Avatar, this has some cool scenes & definitely ranks in my all time top 5 3D animation films.\n\nIf you have kids or you want to impress kids, take them to the movie & wouldn't regret your decision. They would absolutely love this. In fact I would say this is the best family movie this summer I actually beg you to take your kids to \"How to Train Your Dragon\" if you haven't already done so. Since I'm stressing on kids, don't think that this is not for adults. If you have a kid some where in you, you would enjoy this.\n\nLove to hear what you thought about the movie or my review, http://amarsmoviejournal.blogspot.com/"

It's written well, the voice acting is great, the story is fast paced and engaging, but above all, it's just really quite beautiful to look at - and this was in 2D, so I imagine the 3D experience would have been even more of a treat.\n\nThis film works on just about every level. The main characters especially are a highlight - the protagonist gives us a very fresh take on your standard misfit boy type and his pacey and entertaining dialogue is constructed and delivered flawlessly. Even the dragon has more personality to it than most of the stale characters you tend to see in contemporary children's' movies - its design and facial expressions alone are just so well done they convey everything effortlessly.\n\nThere isn't much to the story but then there doesn't need to be. It's a solid family adventure to keep everyone entertained. Where some previous Dreamworks films have failed to keep both child and adult audiences I feel that this one captures both successfully because the dialogue is just so tight and funny and children would just be captivated with the beauty and excitement of what they're seeing.\n\nI'm struggling to say anything negative about this movie at all, in fact. It's just very very good. Go and see it. 9/10."

Personally, I connected with the plight of Hiccup and watching the relationship between him and Toothless blossom was such a great treat! Almost every aspect of this film, from music to visuals to characters are phenomenal.\n\nA big highlight of this movie is the world it creates. It's a whimsical, impossibly large world that blends naturalism of the \"real world\" and exaggerates the enormity which gives the effect of looking at the world from a child's perspective.\n\nWatching this film inspired me to want to become an artist, particularly a character animator. It got me into dragons, inspired my creativity, and gave me a goal to achieve in life--to inspire others the way this film inspired me. This is why How To Train Your Dragon is a 10 for me."

        "review_detailed_main": "This never took my fancy as a kid, simply because I wasn't interested in dragons in the slightest, so I never watched it, even despite my best friend from that period constantly going on about it over the years. But now as a grown adult, but more importantly as a cinephile, I decided to give this a go, especially after I was immensely surprised by the incredibly high ratings that this has received. And I definitely understand where these acclamatory reviews are coming from, as there is a beautiful story which unravels before us.\n\nI really liked how the story was sort of split into two. It eminently highlighted how Hiccup had to lead a double life, including a life where he felt no sense of belonging, it was sadly quite relatable! I also took delight in the sequence where Hiccup learns several new skills from Toothless, and then implements each one into his dragon-fighting training, it was a great way of quickly developing the plot, and very entertaining too.\n\nI adore the score, most notably Test Drive, it's an absolute masterpiece, but the soundtrack as a whole is genuinely tremendous, I'm so glad it was recognized by the Academy, what with it being given an Oscar nomination.\n\nAs for negatives, I found it bizarre, and mildly annoying, that all the children had American accents and the adults had Scottish accents. If they are Vikings, and this is set in Scotland, then surely they should all have Scottish accents? It's just disappointing, and it actually lost me in the Immersion a little bit.\n\nAlso, this film made me realise how much I hate the way relationships are portrayed in family movies. It's honestly infuriating how this picture sticks to the typical romance tropes that you see in almost all other family-friendly films, where the guy wins the girl through doing nothing else but impressing her. You can see it coming from a mile away.\n\nWhen it comes to the animations, almost everything was decent. The one aspect that was poorly executed were the beards of the Vikings, most noticeably Stoick's. They couldn't have looked more computer-generated.\n\nFinally though, I'll end on a good note by saying that what elevated this to a 8/10 for me was the shocking twist that we see when Hiccup gets out of bed, it was completely unexpected, and a decision by the writers that I truly admire.\n\nSo overall, a fantastic feature, one that was much better than I thought it would be."

The story, itself is handled with care with a nice set-up and a more careful cultivation of boy and dragon and the fascinating learning curve obtained by this experience and how it is demonstrated in real practice is smartly addressed by the middle of the movie. Even the ending has a slightly educational and emotive element not usually scene in most action adventure movies. There is humanity and there are the requisite JURASSIC PARK (1993, 1997) moments with man confronting/anthropomorphic animal in the wild experience. In same ways, this movie resembles the basic human, emotional, you versus them conflict premise from THE INCREDIBLES (2004) that made that movie so powerful and compelling."

And the animation is as adept at shooting glowing worlds of surprise - a flight via voluptuous clouds, as inviting as overstuffed pillows, is entirely magical - as it's miles at tiny, telling information. In a flashback that shows Hiccup as a motherless child comforted by means of a father half of-damaged through his personal sadness, the boy has a little scratch on his face. It's this kind of minor element of a richly realised bigger image, and but I observed it oddly poignant - an indication that adolescence, inspite of a fearsome Viking warrior for a dad, will inevitably contain pain.\n\nThe tale hits among the identical beats as in advance incarnations - the dragons, and the Vikings who have a tendency to them, are threatened; Hiccup have to draw upon his management competencies and shop the day. But there's a new maturity both in the character and in the storytelling that makes this final film in the trilogy take wing."

        "review_detailed_main": "As most school children know,the Vikings were originally from Scotland, and spoke fluent English,with a dense Scottish accent. That bit of beefing aside,'How To Train Your Dragon' is a fun time at the cinema. The plot:Hiccup is a young Viking lad who wants to hunt & kill a dragon, just like his brave Father,Stoick. Problem is that Hiccup is something of a screw up who just can't get things straight. One day when the village is being attacked by a horde of dragons,Hiccup manages to land one with a crude sling shot like device. When Hiccup goes to claim his prize (and try,one and for all to impress his dad),he finds out that dragons aren't as evil as they are made out to be. This causes Hiccup to do a radical re-think of dragons & study their movements. In the interim of all of this,Hiccup manages to form a bond of friendship with the dragon (which he even assigns a name:Toothless),all the while he is in training on how to kill a dragon with the other youngsters in the village (under Gobber's tutorial). It's now up to Hiccup to try & go on a one man (boy?)campaign to change the Viking's anti dragon bias. Dean DeBlois (Lilo & Stitch,Heima)& Chris Sanders (also Lilo & Stitch,both the feature film,as well as the television series)co direct,from a screenplay by DeBlois,from the best selling novel by Cressida Cowell. As this is an animated 3D-CGI feature film (released in both digital 3-D,standard 3-D,as well as flat 2-D formats),the voice talent include Jay Baruchel as Hiccup,Gerard Butler ('Rocknrolla','300',and most recently in 'The Bounty Hunter')as Hiccup's father,Stoick,Craig Ferguson ('The Late,Late Show With Craig Ferguson')as Stoick's best friend,Gobber,America Ferrera ('Ugly Betty') as Astrid,Hiccup's adversary,with Jonah Hill,T.J.Miller,Kristen Wiig, Kieron Elliot & Ashley Jensen. This is fast moving fun for one & all. Rated PG by the MPAA,for some intense sequences that may frighten the very young & a bit of rude humour."

        "review_detailed_main": "I came to this movie expecting a child's movie; a typical animation with your typical goofy lines and slapstick humor. Man, was I wrong.\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon is the story of a viking boy, named hiccup, who wants to become a great dragon hunter. The problem is that he doesn't have the skill or brawn to do so. But, one night he manages to shoot out a dragon from the sky, and when he goes to where the dragon crash landed, he's faced with a tough decision. He frees the dragon from its entanglement, and from there his opinion on the creatures are changed.\n\nWhat made this movie so much better than most other animated films out there now-a-days is that it captures the heart-warming relationship between the boy and the dragon excellently and beautifully. It gives itself time to build up the characters, setting, and so on. It is not rushed, and you are able to soak up every touching, mesmerizing, and gorgeous moment at the perfect pace.\n\nIt has a simple, but very effective story. There is no real mystery- drama twist, or some who-done-it tone, but a wonderfully charming and simple tale that, with its simplicity, can capture the hearts of young and old.\n\nThe visuals are stunning. In fact, that is perhaps an understatement. I highly recommend this in 3D; the flying scenes felt so natural and engaging that the extra $3 per ticket is very much worth it. The battle scenes were wonderful; with a wide array of bright colors and some incredibly directed camera work (animated camera work), its hard not to grab the edge of your seat!\n\nThe music, to say the least, is excellent. I'm not to great in describing music, but it fit the movie perfectly. It made the action scenes heart-pumping, the slow scenes compelling, and the flying scenes just perfect.\n\nOverall, with its beautiful story, vivid characters, excellent music, etc., I highly recommend this movie to anybody and everybody. It's a movie that does what a movie is supposed to do - enthrall, fascinate, and stir the emotions of its viewers, and not to mention, tell a really good story."

Craig Ferguson is the only standout in his role.\n\nNow for the 3D. There is only one flying scene in the movie that had me go \"Wow!\", but the rest of the movie did not benefit from the 3D. If I am going to pay that much extra for a ticket, I want to be amazed throughout the movie. Maybe it is the technology, or the theater, or the particular pair of glasses I wore. I thought the scenes appeared mostly out of focus. My glasses kept picking up on the glare from the Exit signs and the aisle lighting. I saw it at a quality theater. Not worth the extra cost."

        "review_detailed_main": "Wow. I never thought there would be a movie that equals the quality of Pixar. This movie is truly a challenge for those great Pixar movies. Dreamworks finest animation movie. Way better than Shrek. The best movie they made. When people animations they mostly make it with lots of comedy with a drama thrown in here and there. The proportion between comedy and drama is a feat achieved by none other than Pixar until now. Yes, I can honestly say that this movie is Dreamworks masterpiece.\n\nI would place this movie under the category of adventure/drama rather comedy/drama. From the beginning to the end the movie keeps you hooked up with fantastic landscapes filled with rich beautiful colors and top-notch animation. I can clearly see with how much passion was this movie crafted with. Likable and enjoyable characters. Simple yet top-notch dialogs. Revised concept yet, unique and refreshing in its own way. Even those simple scenes like eye-contact engulf you with emotion. And, of course there is one huge plus for the movie. The background musical score.\n\nJohn Powell is the man. His musical scored is layered and blended beautifully and succeed in bringing out the emotions even more. Also, the music sticks to your heart for days. Just like Pixar Dreamworks had finally made a film worthy of Oscar. I just hope just like the evolution of Pixar in making better and better movies, Dreamwork with start making better and better movies.\n\nA high praise for the animators who have done an excellent job on animating the dragons through a mixture of emotions and expressions and for the characters as well. A rounding applause for the voice casting. I don't care about the Scottish and English accent. They did a wonderful job in bringing characters to life.\n\nA true masterpiece done with such artistry and passion. I hope this movie get at least one Oscar.\n\nBoy, I wish I had a dragon to ride."

The visuals are stunning and the storyline is an outstanding achievement. I'll only write a review if I enjoy a movie and this is no exception.\n\nA village of vikings is continuously raided by dragons for their food and the towns runt (Hiccup) who isn't allowed to help fight them off (because of his small size) is determined to win his fame by killing the most feared (and never seen) dragon of them all. The night fury. After he uses a self made device Hiccup has his opportunity kill it and win the hearts of his village and the girl of his dreams (Astrid) but sees something deeper than the mindless monsters that he has been bought up to believe them to be.\n\nAfter winning the night fury (toothless's) trust, a friendship blossoms but Hiccup needs to somehow convince his village and his father (Stoick the vast) that these creatures are stealing from them for a much, much more menacing reason.\n\nMy family and I love this movie. It has all the ingredients to make the perfect piece of entertainment for a great film. I especially love the touching scene where Hiccup actually manages to win Astrid's heart. When I saw this scene, I knew that this was going to be something truly special. It's one of my all-time favourite movie scenes. It is an unforgettable moment with amazing visuals and music, and the finally is breathtaking! If you haven't seen this with your family. You are depriving them of an unforgettable experience."

        "review_detailed_main": "I never saw How to Train Your Dragon in the theater. However, I did watch it when it came out on DVD. Having not heard much about the film and not knowing anything about its story or any of that, I didn't have any expectations prior to watching it. However, I ended up loving it. In fact, in my opinion, DreamWorks has surpassed Pixar with this film.\n\nThe story is very simple, predictable, derivative, and clich\u00e9d, and it's a total retread of basic cinema clich\u00e9s, but it works, and I found it entertaining and immersive. There is not much depth, story development, or character development, but it's still pretty effective as it is. Also, the wonderful animation helps contribute to the emotion and energy of the story. So, overall, to sum this up, this film works in many of the same ways that James Cameron's Avatar worked, and in fact it works much better. They both consist of simple, predictable, and clich\u00e9d stories. They don't have much depth, story development, or character development (like I just said above). However, the stories are sufficient, well-structured, well-paced, and coherent, and they flow and make sense.\n\nThe characters are not developed much, but they are sufficient and very likable. Also, both use brilliant visuals and keen detail to tell their stories and bring emotion into them. Although I do have to admit that HTTYD has a somewhat better script and better dialogue. Also, like Avatar, HTTYD doesn't go much into the depth and backgrounds of the characters, or much into any of that stuff, but a lot of that stuff - character background, personality, relationships, etc. - are evident in the detail. So, given all of this, I think it would be safe to say that, in many ways, HTTYD is the Avatar of 2010.\n\nNow, HTTYD doesn't have a new world, like Pandora, but it does have beautiful scenery all the same. Also, it has the lovable dragon Toothless, who is a full character in the film. He was excellently designed, and is very cute and lovable. In addition to excellent physical design, has a great personality, is smart, and has an excellent balance between that of a person and that of an animal. He is a great character, and, in fact, the most memorable character in the film. The voice actors all put on good performances, and they really help bring out their characters with their voice. Jay Baruchel did a very good job as Hiccup. A lot of people say that his voice is annoying, but I personally disagree. I actually kind of like his voice, and it's just right for the character in the movie, Hiccup, who is very likable. The other voice actors did an equally good job with their characters too, such as Gerard Butler as Stoick the Vast, America Ferrera as the likable and beautiful Astrid (Hiccup's love interest), Jonah Hill as Snotlout, and some others.\n\nLike I said before, the animation is absolutely beautiful. John Powell composed and excellent music score for the film. As for the target audience: everyone - in many ways, it's like a kids movie, but in others it's pretty mature. Also, being a good comedy, it has some good humor. But it doesn't let the humor get too abundant. The humor is spaced out throughout the film and given at appropriate intervals, and is balanced excellently with the story, drama, emotion, and moral messages, much like The Iron Giant was. In fact, the film has a lot of similarities to The Iron Giant, and it works for many of the same reasons that movie works. Everything about the movie is very well balanced.\n\nOverall, I love this movie. It's a great family film, it's very entertaining, touching, good- hearted, and visually beautiful. It combines elements of The Iron Giant and Avatar, and breathes new life into old, exhausted clich\u00e9s. Also, it has great staying power - it's one of those movies, like Ghostbusters, that never really gets old on repeated viewings. Unfortunately, DreamWorks plans to make a sequel to it. Wow, way to go, DreamWorks, ruining the best film you've ever made. Please don't make that sequel. This is the type of movie that's just best left alone. Leave a good thing alone.\n\nOne final note: I've only seen this movie in 2-D. I've never seen it in 3-D, and guess what? I don't want to. Aside from the usual fact that 3-D is unnecessary, this movie is so awesome that it doesn't need 3-D.\n\nMy Rating: **** (out of ****)\n\nFor more reviews, visit my website: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com"

The story line is sweet and somewhat predictable with charming lines thrown in there. \"Duh DA Dar, we're dead\" \"Thanks for nothing... you useless reptile\" I've seen a lot of movies, most of which, after a couple watches I will get sick of them and not watch them for another 4 to 5 years, by which time I will likely find something better to watch. This has been my only exception. I could watch this any day and still love it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Prior to How to Train Your Dragon, DreamWorks was known for making movies that had relatively cheap laughs, with a few exceptions. With How to Train Your Dragon, I consider this a departure from that characteristic. How to Train Your Dragon took a more mature approach toward the story they're working with. As a kid, I wasn't a huge fan of this movie when it came out, but when I watched it recently, it became one of my top 3 favorite animated movies, and that's saying something for me. DreamWorks also made one of the gutsiest moves they could've made. I say this because they made it look like an animated Avatar, with the extravagant landscapes, and fantastic 3D animation. I also have to add these little details. First off, the directors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders made Lilo and Stitch, and were also involved with the writing process of Mulan. Talk about a big step forward for these two. Secondly, for those of you who know cinematographers, the two hired the one and only Roger Deakins as a visual consultant for this film. With his repertoire of films, Deakins managed to get the vision that DeBlois and Sanders wanted to come alive on the big screen. What else can this movie offer? A whole lot more, but I won't say anything more without sounding like an idiot."

And it's innocent, just the way a cartoon should be. You can watch this with your kids without feeling concerned with the innuendos typically thrown into most movies these days, and still fully enjoy it yourself. Good moral, great characters, awesome plot, phenomenal music. I've always liked the idea of dragons and other mythological creatures and this film amplifies that. Basically it's about a teen whose eccentric and open-minded personality doesn't jive with his dragon-killing, brawn-over-brains Viking peers. Desperate to fit in, he becomes determined to do what no Viking has ever done and kill an extremely dangerous Night Fury Dragon. One night he actually succeeds to injure the infamous creature only to discover that dragons aren't at all what he's been led to believe....and it just gets better from there. Love it and would recommend it to anyone!"

        "review_detailed_main": "So the 3D Bandwagon rolls forward, and whilst I'm amongst many that don't want 3D to take over the film industry but I do think it has it's place. Avatar used 3D brilliantly to make it an involving, immersive film, animated films, like Up look spectacular in 3D, so How To Train YOur Dragon falls under that category. Where I don't like 3D is when it is just cheaply converted in 3D and throws stuff at the camera, so they pop out at you, yes, sometimes it is good, but otherwise it is just cheap film making. So before I express my views on the movie let me tell you what it's about\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon, follows a young viking living in a village where Dragons are pests. His father is the chief viking, and this young boy is to be trained all his life to learn to kill dragons. This young boy (Hiccup) is not a very tough boy, and he isn't a very good slayer, but when he befriends a Dragon secretly he learns more about these creatures and what their characteristics are and that there is much more to these animals.\n\nThe Film gets off to a slow start, but when the boy and dragon start flying, this becomes a short and sweet animated film, reminiscent of Kung-FU Panda. The Voice Acting was pretty good, not quite Toy Story, but still a good effort. The 3D Was done superbly, with subtle touches to breathtaking shots at you, it really felt like you were there, so much so it was enough to rival Avatar. The Movies characters all contributed to this movie, and do capture a great deal of emotion in scenes for this movie. The movie really was entertaining, in the highest order, the plot flowed well, and really captured the audience. The whole film as I said before was really reminiscent of Kung-Fu Panda, a short, cute heartwarming movie."

        "review_title": "Uplifting, fun, one of the best animated films ever!",
        "review_detailed_main": "REVIEW:\n\nThis entry into 3D cinema is a wonderful adventure which has both elements of a traditional fairy tale and of a modern teen nerd story. It tells a updated version of befriending dragons, similar to The Neverending Story and Dragonheart. The animation is Dreamworks' best and sets very high standards with its complexities with dragon flight, fire-breathing, and nature (clouds, water, etc). My friends and I found it uplifting, funny and off-beat, not unlike Shrek. The voices especially those of Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, and Christopher Mintz- Plasse were terrific. Hiccup and Fishlegs are refreshing, unheroic nerds much like Po in Kung Fu Panda.\n\nI heard the reviews which were generally very good but this movie exceeded my expectations in the first ten minutes with its dramatic opener. Aside from that, the soaring flight into the sky with Hiccup and Astrid was animation at its most majestic. The relationship between Hiccup and his father Stoick was the most endearing family relationship I've seen portrayed in animation. The lines for Hiccup, Fishlegs, and most of the other Viking teens was colorful, sarcastic and insightful. The lighting, color and cinematography push the boundaries and are unmatched in animation.\n\nIf any shortcoming this film has, I thought initially the dragons should have been bigger and more scary, but that would have defeated the plot. Some people criticized the dragons but when you realize what the filmmakers were attempting, it made perfect sense. In fact, the variety of dragons was very creative as we are introduced to many of them. Toothless, although plain-looking was made to resemble a big black cat or panther. The idea of dragons as pests to dragons as pets defined the roles of dragons in this movie.\n\nCRITICS?\n\nMost interesting was Roger Ebert's criticism of the film. I don't think he actually watched it since quite a few of his comments were factually incorrect. For example, suggesting Hiccup used a cannon, that the adult Vikings rode the dragons or there was a final battle scene between good and tons of bad dragons. Those things never happened...uh, Roger.\n\nIn addition, some people wrote in on IMDb. First, there's comparison with Pixar which many believe sets the standards. Second, there's complaints that the story is unoriginal and too familiar. I would challenge both. First, if you check the success of both companies, Pixar has 9 movies grossing over $400 million worldwide and Dreamworks has 8 movies grossing over $400 million. Second, the average Pixar rates slightly higher but I feel some of Pixar films are slightly overrated in particular Wally-E or The Incredibles (I know, sacrilegious to some). (On the other hand, I think Ratatouille is far superior to Wally-E or The Incredibles.) Some people find HHTYD theme of a son trying to please or fulfill his father's expectations as too familiar and unoriginal...but really, can you name a film that has the same theme? The most common movie plots and genres are: action thrillers, sexy murders, horror, superheros (why the Incredibles is less original), romantic comedies, fairy tale endings, sci-fi thrillers, vampire movies (as of late), westerns, musicals, sports movies, period romances and period actions (e.g., Gladiator)...well, I made my point. I think people think this theme has been often done, but it is only our own story at home (we all have families, right?) that makes it familiar. Besides considering films like The Lion King or Beauty and the Beast...are those great animated films original? Clearly Dragons is refreshing and more original.\n\nTHE BEST ANIMATED FILMS\n\nDragon ranks as Dreamworks best along with Shrek. Right behind are Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit and Kung Fu Panda. It's in the class with Pixar's Up, Toy Story 3 and maybe Ratatouille. They rank along with the more classic greats as Sleeping Beauty, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King or Snow White...or less traditional animated films like Spirited Away, The Iron Giant, or South Park. In short, How To Train Your Dragon ranks as one of the top 10-15 animated films of all-time."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hiccup, is a viking, but not a typical one. While his father Stoick is big, strong and tough, Hiccup is small and wimpy. While other Vikings are battling their archenemies, the dragons, with swords and catapults, Hiccup is designing mechanical devices to protect the village from the reptiles. While the other Viking kids fight fires in the village when attacked by dragons, Hiccup is stuck manning the blacksmith shop. In short, he doesn't fit in.\n\nWhen Hiccup tests one of his dragon fighting devices in battle, he manages to take down one of the most deadly and rare dragons known to the Vikings. But when faced with the option of killing the wounded creature, he finds himself unable to do so. Not only that, he starts studying and helping the creature survive and regain flight. Hiccup soon learns that everything they thought about dragons was completely wrong. But when the world of the Vikings and the dragons collide again, which side will Hiccup take?\n\nHow To Train Your Dragon is by far one of the best animated movies I've seen, it reminded me so much of Eragon, i recommend this movie for you people that loves vikings and dragons."

        "review_title": "A very pleasant and entertaining film",
        "review_detailed_main": "Dragon is probably one of the most entertaining films I've seen in the theater for a while. Full of viking/dragon action, some fantastic aerial scenes, and a bit of humor, Dragon is not only a pleasant film for kids but for adults too. The fact that it revolves around dragons also helps quite a bit, because otherwise I'm afraid it would be a bit too run of the mill.\n\nNothing about the films setup is very surprising. It's your typical story about human being misunderstanding creatures and killing them because of such. No different really from other films dealing with the innate fear humans have and the effects of such fear. In this one, vikings are seemingly terrorized by dragons, until one of the vikings, Hiccup, injures one and begins to make friends with it. Yadda yadda yadda, you know the drill. But, this is a case of the specifics separating this film from others. First of all, there are dragons, and everyone knows dragons are cool. Secondly, there are vikings, and who doesn't like a good viking story. Putting these two together is like mixing cheesecake and chocolate: it just works. But in all seriousness, it's a good combination that provides for some truly entertaining scenes involving lots of dragon riding.\n\nNow, if you're turned off by the fact that the story is mostly been there, done that safety work, then this may not be for you. I know everyone searches for originality, and this is probably about as unoriginal as an animation can get. But, if you can get over that fact, then you will probably also find this to be quite fun. I for one have no problem with something clich\u00e9, as long as all the pieces fit together and it's entertaining. And this was.\n\nMy only real gripe with the film is the voice acting. It feels a bit phoned in, and I never really got any personality from the characters through their voices. The cast did decent, serviceable work, but it's nothing memorable, which is really a shame. Although, I will say that the choice of Gerard Butler was pretty good casting, if only because he definitely fits the part of the tough viking leader. The film is also quite technically sound, with some incredible scenes of flight. Most of the best parts are of Hiccup and his pet dragon flying around.\n\nDragon may not be the most original animation on the market, but it fits together quite nicely. It's highly entertaining and the dragons are quite likable. It's also pleasant to see a film that doesn't shy away from some more mature content, particularly at the end. It's nice to see the studio not treating our children as if they were blind to the ill tidings of the world. Kids will like this, children will like this, and people in between may find it quite enjoyable too."

        "review_detailed_main": "It had been a few years since I'd seen this movie, even though I own both this film and the sequel (\"How to Train Your Dragon 2\"), and I was excited to revisit it. My revisit has rekindled my love for this movie. This is a wonderful film that fills me with joy each time I watch it. Not only is this a great kids movie, it appeals to adults; it's a great story with amazing design and more heart than I ever would've thought possible. While the story might be a touch predictable after it gets going, the character development that comes along with the story brings a level of earnestness to the story I rarely see in animated films. The people and their relationships feel real, as do the consequences for their actions. As tensions get higher near the end of the film, the world expands, and the consequences more dire. The final battle in this movie is probably one of the best dragon fight scenes ever brought to cinema, if not the best (What other dragon films even compare to this one? \"Reign of Fire\"? Yeah, right...). The final fight, pitting the enormous dragon against Toothless and Hiccup is beautifully shot, absolutely stunning to watch, and epic in every sense of the word."

The story is told by a Hickup, a adolescent Viking boy. What's interresting is the fact that the way he's built corrolates with his personality. Violet, i think?, she's the oil on which the story rides. His love for her, inspires him to be his best version. VISUALS ARE EXCELLENT! For all ages and all occasions. Greeting by CastEau"

        "review_detailed_main": "Ever since I got the chance to visit Dreamworks Studios last summer, I've been dying to see this film, and it did not disappoint! with Dreamworks animated films, its usually hit or miss with them, but HTRYD is a big success. Visually it's awesome, if you are a fan of dragons like I am your or your children should definitely enjoy this, whether or not you read the book its based on dosen't really matter, this movie is a lot of fun and the way the dragons were depicted was great.\n\nthe movie follows a pretty simple formula.. awkward weak kid who isn't like everyone else, fails at everything, and dosen't get any respect from his friends and family but ends up proving himself in another way. But here it works for the story quite well. The story isn't perfect or too deep or whatever, but I think it was just fine for what it was.\n\nand of course I think anyone watching this, adult or child will love the main dragon character Toothless..he is basically Stitch from Lilo and Stich in dragon form, after all the writers and directors of this film also created Lilo and Stitch, but even so the dragon has his own lovable personality.\n\nas far as what format to go see this in, I saw it in 3D because the theater I went to only offered it in 3D..but the 3D was quite enjoyable...it was more subtle and mostly just added more depth to everything which was nice..and in some scenes it really was great to look at, so I suggest seeing it in 3D, but I try seeing it earlier in the day, $9 for a early afternoon showing...yikes! SO if you are looking to be entertained go see this film, anyone should enjoy it!"
