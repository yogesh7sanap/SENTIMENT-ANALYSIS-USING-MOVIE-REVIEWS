        "review_detailed_main": "Erotic thrillers have been huge money-spinners worldwide, but it was not until Vishesh films took the first step and started making films like \"Fareb\" & \"KASOOR\" that bollywood jumped into the bandwagon.\n\nThe \"Hate Story\" series is one successful franchise and a new film coming from it would arouse among other things our curiosity and with a loads of help from the no holds barred teasers and trailers.\n\nHATE STORY 3 comparatively is the best of the lot in the franchise, if you ignore the bad acting and the poker faces. The girls show lot of skin, but cannot act to save their lives ditto with the guys. But it is the screenplay with its twists and turns which holds your attention that you are willing to forgive everything else even the fizzled out climax.\n\nAditya Diwan (Sharman Joshi) a successful Industrialist happily married to his late brother Vikram Diwan (Priyanshu Chatterjee)'s ex Siya (Zarine Khan) is jolted out of his idyllic life when Saurav Singhania (Karan Singh Grover) a multi billionaire barges into his life offering his friendship to the couple. Things go well till Saurav asks Aditya to let him sleep with Siya for a huge financial benefit to the latter. Aditya walks out on Saurav.\n\nSaurav meticulously plans Aditya's financial ruin, and extends the proposal to Siya. An enraged Aditya plants his secretary Kaya (Daisy Irani) in Saurav's domain. Saurav and Kaya get tangled physically and Kaya feeds information related to Saurav's business to Aditya and also a deadly secret related to Aditya's past connected to Saurav which could pretty well be the driving force of Saurav's vengeance.\n\nArmed with such information, Aditya is all set to ruin Saurav when the latter turns the tables on him and Aditya ends up in prison. Saurav renews his indecent proposal to Siya who agrees to sleep with him in exchange for her husband's acquittal.\n\nThe task completed, Siya learns a deadly secret of Saurav and she realizes he is not what he claims to be and\u0085\u0085\u0085\n\nAlas, if only the film makers had chosen people who could actually act, the film would have been a masterpiece in the erotic thriller genre.\n\nSharman Joshi is OK when it comes to scenes where he is required to stand and do nothing, but when he is supposed to mouth his lines that when the hamming starts.\n\nZarine Khan is ready to strip at the drop of a hat, but struggles when it comes to emotions.\n\nDaisy Shah is pathetic both in the erotic as well as the emoting department.\n\nIt is Karan Singh Grover who puts up a great act, there are moments when he gets so deep into the skin of the character he radiates an aura of danger in the scenes where his true character is revealed.\n\nScreenplay by Vikram Bhatt is clever and holds our attention, even minus the erotica, the movie would still make a good thriller. The only sad part is they should have concentrated more on the ending, tying the loose ends is just not enough, when they are not done satisfactorily.\n\nMusic by Amaal malik is good, especially with songs like \"Tumhe Apne banane ki\" and \"love to hate u\".\n\nThe movie has high production values and the direction is decent, Vishal Pandya succeeds in making this the best entry in the series. Hope he concentrates a bit more in casting in the next installment.\n\nI would recommend it to anyone who are fond of thrillers."

The only thing they acted as real were the steamy erotic scenes, except that nothing was much worth watching. I was hoping to have a good plot and story for the movie. The trailer promised a lot for the audience to go to theatre for this Adult movie but was really depressed after watching this. Zarine khan whose career was never started was hoping to comeback with this but would have been better if she knew better acting. The plot was confusing and revenge was the only thing in the movie. The only thing I liked in this movie were its songs. Amaal Malik had beautiful composition in this flick. I am disappointed with this one and would go with 2/5 for Hate Story 3 and would recommend audience to avoid this."

        "review_detailed_main": "HATE STORY 3 REVIEW- LOL i was waiting for this movie for some other reasons i mean perverted mind. And all credit goes to freaking awesome vulgar drama Hate Story. That movie set a benchmark and almost became a franchise now days. Just like Hate Story 2 even Hate Story 3 created tremendous buzz before release cause we expect a movie like Hate Story again. Same with Hate Story 2 which was awaited because of being a sequel to Hate Story but movie was crap. That movie was totally censored and disappointed everyone including me. So i was thinking censor will strike again for Hate Story 3 and same happened. Nowdays Censor has became very strict for Adult movies. Not even allowing intimate scenes, abusing words but openly allowing abusing words in English. So If you are expecting vulgarity and some sexy scenes from Hate Story 3 then you will disappointed for sure. All hot scenes are there in songs only so you don't need to watch movie in theater for those scenes. Watch it on mobile or TV only. But surprisingly beyond this vulgarity n sexy things this movie comes out to be a sure shot winner because of its script. I repeat this time its Script which gonna impress everyone instead of vulgarity. My expectations was zero i was expecting a little bit better movie than crap Hate Story 2 and 1st half totally disappointed me. I was about to declare that my money gone wasted but then last 30 mins of movie blown me away. Till the interval i was like, its not at all Hate Story its an updated of 'Race'. The same brother hatred, revenge, money, girlfriend stuff was going on. After interval movie took pace and last 30-35 mins totally changed the scenario and movie ended on strong note. A msg come from movie is 'Sometimes Friend can be better than Brother'. I wont reveal anything about story cause its a thriller and revealing a story will spoil all the fun. Acting - The best performance came from Karan Singh Grover who came back strong here after debacle 'Alone'. He completely overtook everyone in the movie. He got good physics and looks but In some last scenes he proved his acting skills also. 2nd best performance was of Sharman Joshi. He is known as actor for all and he did what we expect from him. But in some scene he overacted, looked very loud and irritating. Zareen Khan looks hot but failed to impress with her performance. Same with Daisy Shah. Still quit good enough performance according to movie and their particular roles. Other supporting star cast were good enough too. Story - Certainly the best part of a movie is its writing. It was written smartly. Screenplay - As i said story was smartly written but screenplay wasn't enough smart to the level of story. Especially 1st half was totally dull. 2nd half was also dull but last 30 mins saved the film. Music - A good music album but nothing to remember. No emotional songs no theme songs. Party songs were irritating. Love songs were strictly average. Background was also bad. Direction - I don't know why director promoted movie as vulgar drama when he had strong story in hand. May be he was thinking to make movie a commercial success over appreciation. Movie was directed very well actually when it comes to watch it as a Thriller. The problem was he took too much time to set plot for freaking awesome climax. Nothing impressive but still, overall good direction. Final words - Certainly better than Hate Story 2 and almost to the level of Hate Story 1 if you keep vulgarity things and level beside. My request to everyone just forget Hate Story 1 2 and promos of this movie which promise to be vulgar drama and watch it as Fresh movie and i am sure you will like it as a Thriller. Go for it, enjoy. Indeed one time watch for all ages and all kind of audience. 7/10 stars by me."

        "review_detailed_main": "Only open sensuality which surrenders to the male gaze can be the reason why the Hate Story series has been going on unhindered since it first started to annoy us in 2012. Hate Story 3 is as ridiculous as its predecessors with greater sleaze and a dumber storyline.\n\nIndustrialist Aditya Deewan (Joshi) has been successfully carrying out his multiple businesses mainly because he gets laid every night, all thanks to his well-endowed wife, Siya (Khan), who was formerly his sister-in-law before his brother died in an plane crash. Out of the blue, their matrimony as well as Aditya's businesses are targeted for sabotage by a mysterious man named Saurav (Grover) who wants to enjoy Siya for a night. (Man, she must be good.) As the husband-wife duo begin to find out about this guy, skeletons start to tumble out of the closet.\n\nThe story, at first, reminds us of Abbas-Mustan's hit film Race (2008), however, the lack of enthusiasm involved in the narration confirms that Mr. Pandya, an amateur, is the man at the helm. Basically, all the characters in the film are antagonists. Maybe because the makers wanted the audience to don the cap of protagonists and escape from the torture that follows after the outline is laid out.\n\nUnnecessary songs slipped in at various nodes, unpleasant, badly directed, and horrendously enacted sequences of romance add to further annoyance. There is also this rocky background music that fades in and out of every scene that is supposedly major, forcing its audience to use cotton plugs.\n\nThe cast performance is nowhere near satisfactory. Joshi shouts and curses at his co-actors and looks hapless mostly because of the idea of bearing with the incompetent Ms. Shah and of making love to the enemy of acting, Ms. Khan. Grover, too, looks as if he is in a body- building tournament and is purely intimidated by his female co-actors who also seem be to flashing their bodies with great fervor.\n\nIn addition to the poor acting, direction, and dialogs, the climax is unbelievable and will force one to shout.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Hate Story 3 is a dark and unambitious story of people who want to share bodily fluids with each other, but want someone to shout \"action\" at them so that they can go about it. Easily avoidable.\n\nGRADE: F\n\nCan be watched with a typical Indian family? NO\n\nKissing/Vulgarity: Medium | Profanity: Medium | Alcohol/Violence: Medium | Gore: High"

        "review_detailed_main": "Bhatt camp had successfully launched franchises of erotic-sex thrillers like Raaz , Jannat , Murder and Hate Story. The combo of skin-show, melodious music and powerful performances worked well for Hate Story and its sequel giving an extra edge over others. While, Hate Story was a complete surprise considering the trailer showed exotic and bold scenes by Paoli Dam, but more than that, it had fine performances by the star cast and good story. Hate Story 2 also did have few moments to keep you engaged. Production values and star- cast of Hate Story 3 looked bigger and better, but the film is a complete waste of time .\n\nAditya ( Sharman Joshi ) and Siya ( Zarine Khan ) are happily married and living life to the fullest. Enters Saurav Singhania ( Karan Singh Gover) in the scene and the lives of lovely couple changes overnight when he offers a business deal which Aditya cannot refuse.\n\nThe only difference in Hate Story 3 as compared to its previous films is that the revenge drama is based from a male perspective. The franchise is known for its extremely erotic scenes and cat-mouse game. Hate Story 3 has lots of steamy scenes, melodious songs minus script and thriller which should have been key to keep audience interest alive. The definition of story, script and direction does not fit in the film. In few scenes, you will wonder how amateurish can Vishal Pandya (director) get. There is a scene where Karan Singh Grover is fighting for his life in the hospital and in the next scene, he is jumping and running all over the place fighting with enemies. Just before the intermission, we see couple ( Sharman Joshi and Zarine Khan) quarreling in their dining room and all of sudden, Karan Singh Grover enters the scene \u2013 Did the director forgot to keep the door locked ? The torture does not end here, the dialogues like \"Aap Haar Maan Na Nahi Chahte, Aur Maine Haar Maanna Sikha Nahi. Toh Abh Dekhna Yeh Hai Ki Jeet Ta Kaun Hain\" and \"Matlab Jaan Jaay Lekin Sambhog Hone Na Paaye\" reminds that you are watching a 90's film and will make you scratch your head.\n\nThere is no plot here and frequent insertion of songs just spoils the entire mood of the film. Art direction and Cinematography is decent. Editing is horrible. Coming to the performances, none of actors could do justice to their roles. Sharman Joshi was extremely loud with irritating usage of f**k word in every dialogue he says. Zarine Khan and Daisy Shah were used to add glamour and nothing else. They better continue doing what they do the best \u2013 item songs. Karan Singh Grover is completely wooden. His dialogue delivery minus expression will make you feel as if reading a text book.\n\nOverall, Hate Story 3 is a insanely horrible film in every sense. Pathetic : 0.5/5\n\n\u2013 Ketan Gupta"

        "review_detailed_main": "This story begins with a rich businessman by the name of \"Aditya Diwan\" (Sharman Joshi) and his beautiful wife \"Siya Diwan\" (Zareen Khan) officiating at the inauguration of a new hospital. As it so happens, Siya had previously had a romantic affair with Aditya's older brother \"Vikram Diwan\" (Priyanshu Chatterjee) but things didn't turn out very well as he died in an airplane accident and their unborn child miscarried. Even so, Siya is now quite happy and her marriage to Aditya is very strong. However, things begin to get very strange when another rich businessman by the name of \"Saurav Singhania\" (Karan Singh Grover) invites the two of them to his home where he tells Aditya that in exchange for a large sum of money he wants Siya all to himself for one night. Needless to say, this infuriates Aditya who angrily storms out. But what Aditya doesn't know is that Saurav is prepared to go to incredible lengths to get what he wants. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film started out incredibly well but started to lose its momentum about halfway through with the plot becoming more and more ridiculous as it went on. To be fair, Zareen Khan was certainly quite attractive and I liked the manner in which the mystery behind Saurav's reasoning for wanting Siya was kept secret until the very end. But even so, the weaknesses mentioned earlier were much too obvious to be ignored and I have rated this film accordingly. Average."

        "review_detailed_main": "Director Mr. Vishal Pandya works is really appreciating. His style of taking shots are fresh and interesting. Story by Vikram Bhatt, could have been at least bearable but in the enthusiasm of making it more thrilling he has gone over board. Screenplay by him is fine. Dialogues by him and Anupam Saroj are OK. How can a person could be poisonous in this era!! They justified it with snake tattoo on his back!! Ridiculous. Girl knows the personal antidote of that person without knowing the person!? Mixing pesticides in cold drinks of nation fame corporate company is as simple as mixing in a country liquor domestic plant. Without any CCTV of other high end security gadgets available company was running it. There are lots of things which had been kept with the typical excuse that it is film. Gone are the days. Audiences are smart enough to laugh on such type of excuses. This film somehow manages to offers some hot scenes at least. Climax fight was so childish. Escaping from hospital, suddenly coming with pistol then again combat fight at already placed empty cartoon boxes and erected fake walls. All security persons are emptying their bullets on a dead body. When you are thinking to make a suspense thriller you have to be extra careful otherwise be ready to witness laughter on your so called high octane scenes. First half is good but second half is headache. Film looks beautiful and credit goes to cinematographer Prakash Kutty. Performance wise Sharman Joshi as Aditya Dewan is OK. Karan Singh Grover as Saurav Singhania is good. Zareen Khan as Sia Dewan looks like over pumped balloon and acts as same. Daisy Shah as Kavya, at least looks beautiful and acts a bit. Music wise \"Tujhe Apna Banane Ka junoon\" is melodious. Rest track are also fine."

Acting is very poor in the movie and is the weak point of the film! Negative roles don't suit sharman joshi, and daisy shah. Zarine Khan provides some glamor but again doesn't know how to act! Karan was average.... Screenplay is weak. Background score is below average. doesn't know how to act! i recommend it for a one time watch....."

        "review_title": "Skip this mess as you have already seen what you might be looking for in the song videos.",
        "review_detailed_main": "To begin with, we all know what sells here in our films apart from the Big Stars and that's exactly what's being offered in this third product of the franchise strictly known for its erotic content presented along with a 'must have' storyline. To explain it further, HATE STORY 3 is actually 'two films' woven into one, with the first one offering you the much expected erotica & bedroom scenes all incorporated in its deliberately added songs inserted at regular intervals. And the second is a typical Abbaas-Mustaan type of suspense thriller (with a surprise entry towards the end) which doesn't work at all due to a sloppy editing, an immature direction and many absurd twists & turns throwing the characterization out of the window as if it's never supposed to be there in a film like this.\n\nAs a result you have business tycoons behaving like college boys, legal blames being put on colleagues just like that, killings going on as if they have already bought the police & law, a lab sequence as well as graphics reminding you of those scientists & blasts shown in the black & white movies of 50s-60s and the ladies being there only to prove themselves bolder than the other with more intense skin show, deep kisses and suggestive body movements providing the expected content.\n\nBut here a worth mentioning catch is that if you are only interested in the film for some more erotic sequences than the already seen, then its going to be a big disappointment for sure, as HATE STORY 3 doesn't have anything more to offer apart from what has already been revealed in its various song videos before the official release. However if you still wish to watch those bodies moving freely on the bigger screen in the theater, then that's a different personal choice beyond any discussion.\n\nBeginning with an unexpected emotional scene, HS3 straight away comes to the point in the first 10 minutes itself showcasing the most famous song and then starts delivering the same old routine stuff quite carelessly keeping the logic aside. Post intermission the proceedings further enter their 'the worst zone' when a song abruptly begins saying 'Yeh Kaise Ho Gaya' and you feel like as if the lyricist has somehow read your mind thinking in exactly the same language. Stating its few merits, though an energetic background score, fine cinematography and some melodious songs don't let you feel like watching something really bad. But the way it starts heading towards the culmination in a quite childish way, repeatedly makes you think about the filthy one sided mindset behind its poor making.\n\nBesides, its most famous song, \"Tumhe Apna Banane\" honestly forced me to think that how can it be officially labeled as a reworked version of the original song from film SADAK (1991), when even the cult track of SADAK was also blatantly copied from a Pakistani song \"Chale To Kat Hi Jayega Safar\" sung by Mussarrat Nazir that was never disclosed either by the composers or the music company at the time of its release.\n\nAnyway moving on to performances, the stunners here remain the two girls Zarine Khan and Daisy Irani, obviously not for any of their acting skills but for their 'nothing to hide' attitude while enacting on the bed to be specific. And its Zarine Khan who simply catches you unaware performing with such a bold confidence with both her young male co-stars in all the sexy sequences, whereas Daisy still needs to work hard on her scenes apart from the 'taking off your clothes' act that always works on the screen, irrespective of who is doing it.\n\nIn the male leads, Sharman Joshi should immediately forget this film to get back on the right track and Karan Singh Grover should not expect much either from this'women oriented subject' in terms of box office response. In the supporting cast,Priyanshu Chatterjee does deliver a pleasant surprise once again playing a similar role and rest are just okay in their given roles.\n\nComing back to its basic script structure, HATE STORY 3 (directed by Vishal Pandya), clearly takes its references from various sources (typically penned by story-screenplay writer Vikram Bhatt) including the basic plot reminding you of INDECENT PROPOSAL (1993), the faulty cold drinks and blame game insertion taken from our own CORPORATE (2006) and the terrace scene where the two heroes meet, faintly making you recall a similar one in THE DEVIL's ADVOCATE (1997). In short it's once again the same mix of an inspired revenge saga served along the essential erotica with two fresh female faces in the lead, who actually remain the only major attraction of the project for all the obvious reasons.\n\nIn fact this is a quite good business strategy of making money through such a sure shot 'movie franchise' hitting the bulls eye, wherein you quickly get a crime thriller screenplay written inspired by a couple of hit films, cast one or two beautiful fresh female faces in every new part of the series having the right curves, ask them to take off their clothes in some tastefully shot songs & bed room scenes, get some good melodious songs to run in the backdrop serving the right erotic mood and then walk your way to the banks after only a few days of its release making some quick money.\n\nIf truth be told then this was widely done by many B-C grade producers in the forgettable decade of 80s as well as 90s churning out some cheap, awful movies to be shown in the morning shows and the smaller centers earning some decent returns. But now the same act is being practiced again in a much upgraded corporate style by all the reputed names, that actually reveals the ugly side of the business popularly termed as Show-Biz."

        "review_detailed_main": "I didn't have much expectation while watching this film, as I knew this is a small budget with small actors. Also the Hate Story series doesn't have much of a story. But to my surprise I enjoyed this one. It gets you interested from the very beginning. Then come the twists, you always sense that there is more to it that you actually see. At the end I felt that this is the film I enjoyed the most this year after B.Bhaijaan. Acting is average, but this is expected.Karan showed some potential. The Ladies does what they are supposed to do, to make it one of the hottest in the series. Sharman clearly was not in his comfort zone, he is one for sweet films only. Biggest letdown is the dialogue. Most songs are chartbusters I would recommend this one, but certainly not with family."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hate Story 3 released on 4 December 2015. It stars Sharman Joshi, Karan Singh Grover, Zarine Khan and Daisy Shah in the lead roles. I said that the above two parts had a simple story but this part had an extraordinary story and the presentation was very good. I regard this part as the best in the three parts which we have discussed till yet. Made on a simple budget of 20 crores, this film is the most successful in the whole franchise. Every song in the film is good. The specialty of this film is that it doesn't star cast any high fame star celebrity but all the actors have done their role religiously. Karan Singh Grover plays the role of Saurav Singhania and Sharman Joshi plays the role of Aditya Diwan while Zarine Khan plays the role of Sharman Joshi's wife. I would not elaborate much of the story because it is better if you watch this film out. After all, as much I tell the story it would spoil the essence of the film and believe me this film is very good. I give this film a positivity rating."

        "review_detailed_main": "Not bad at all. Liked it because did not expect much. Twists are available after every 15 20 minutes. Some part of movie is totally non understandable. But movie has to be entertaining and this isn't boring anywhere. Acting wise people say Sharman is best but he looked worst. Zarine had nothing to do while Daisy has a small role. Karan Singh Grover did OK. Sad to see quality actor like Priyanshu in a small role. Though his role is most important. Another quality actor wasted though he is doing great in regional films. I suggest people to watch this for entertainment. Many similarities between this movie and Race 1. Only difference is no quality of Saif and Akshay."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well I have watched earlier Hate stories & just to let u know ds one s better n terms of story dn its previous predecessors. Now 4 ds movie straight it gives me a feel on of Wild things popular series of Hollywood ( Crime , Any one can do it, Erotic stuff, Sexy lasses). Well ds movie honestly fails on the erotic front in spite of having sexy lass like Zarine & Daisy.\n\nWont go n d story much.. but it could have been handled much better. The problem s the acting Sharman unfortunately s d biggest disappointment as the shades that his character demands is missing. Karan Grover is descent. Zarine and Daisy are just OK.\n\nOn the whole this movie could have been better if the script and the direction was a little tight. But if you watch you will not be disappointed as a one time watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "Out of 3 hate stories, this is the best one.\n\nWhen you watch this story, somewhere your mind will calculate all possibilities and suspense. Surprisingly all perceptions will go wrong if you want to know reason or hidden truth of story.\n\nExcept Daisy Shah, all characters performed perfectly.\n\nSome songs with vulgar scenes can only be drawback of this movie, though they are good to listen.\n\nCostume design, music and locations is perfect as per story requirement. Acting skills from best to worst of main characters - Zarine Khan, Karan Grover, Sharman Joshi, Daisy Shah.\n\nI call suspense thriller movie which definitely entertained with nice story line."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hate Story 3 is the biggest commercial hit of the hate story franchise, it made around 60 crores at the box office. Several critics wrote that KSG was the star of the movie, and one needs to watch the movie to believe how good he is in it! The whole movie is about him and he carries his role with aplomb! Critics also wrote that due to KSG's big female fan following the cinema halls of hate story 3 saw a big female crowd, not surprised, considering how hot he is in this movie. The songs are brilliant and the movie is a complete out and out masala entertainer that keeps you guessing till the very end! A pretty well made thriller with just a few glitches! 8/10"
