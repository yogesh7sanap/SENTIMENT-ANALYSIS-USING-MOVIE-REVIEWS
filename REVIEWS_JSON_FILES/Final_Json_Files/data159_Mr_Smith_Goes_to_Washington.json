        "review_detailed_main": "A senator suddenly dies and a replacement needs to be named. The other senator for the state, Joseph Paine (Claude Rains), along with Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold), his corrupt businessman backer, decide to name a truly surprising candidate, one Jefferson Smith (James Stewart). He's meant to be nothing more than a seat warmer so that Paine and Taylor can push through a new piece of legislation concerning a dam, meant to make them filthy rich. Unfortunately Mr. Smith is something they've rarely seen and are utterly incapable of understanding: a good and honest man. And a boy scout to boot.\n\nThe film is corny and filled with pathos. Phrases like \"the American dream\", \"truth and honesty\", \"reliability\", and so many like those, get thrown around all the time. Politicians are nothing more than hungry jackal fat cats, aiming to filch the hard-earned pennies of the good American people. True way of life is to be found outside, on the prairies where grass leans on the wind. On the mountains reflected against the noon sun. I could feel my spleen turning red, white and blue as I watched this film.\n\nAnd yet, despite all that, the film is magnificent. Perhaps it's because 'It's a Wonderful Life', another film from director Frank Capra, also stars Stewart, but for some reason or other this film reminds me of Christmas. Because Christmas is also corny and filled with pathos. It is. But it's also the best time of the year. When it's okay to be a bit sentimental. Or a lot sentimental. When it's okay to remind ourselves of the values we all hold dear, but which we usually don't talk about because it's seen as embarrassing.\n\nHopefully people still watch this film. Because even though it's old, and corny, and sentimental, and even a bit silly, it's values, themes and lessons are as relevant today as they were back then. Perhaps even more so."

James Stewart plays the innocence and naivety required for the role to perfection while you can genuinely believe that Jean Arthur has actually fallen for him for real. The great Claude Reins fills the boots of the corrupt senator with aplomb while Edward Arnold reminds us of a few of his type that are still around today. Probably the best film you'll ever see with the most mundane of titles."

        "review_detailed_main": "Frank Capra was an idealist for sure, but he certainly was clear-eyed in seeing some of the darkest problems with humanity and its institutions. At the beginning of this film, he shows us politicians who are firmly in the pocket of special interests, the degree to which is startling. A state governor (Guy Kibbee) is in charge of picking a new senator after one of the two serving for his state has passed away, but it's immediately clear that he operates as a puppet for a big businessman (Edward Arnold), a guy whose clout got the governor his position, and now who expects to call the shots as payback. We see it as one of the fundamental problems of representative government in 1939, just as it is today, so the film is highly, highly relevant.\n\nNow it's laughable that the governor would go rogue and put the head of the Boy Rangers, Jefferson Smith (Jimmy Stewart), in there instead, based on the pleading of his children and a coin flip that lands on its edge, but that's the premise of the film. It's an obvious call to clean up Washington, and get decent, upright people in there as representatives, and in delivering this message, Capra does not attempt subtlety or realism. And I may as well say it now before I blab on, it's laughable how the kids play the role they do later in the film too, and how the other senator (Claude Rains) behaves in the end. Maybe the film is pointing out that progress will always depend more on the next generation, and that ultimately it will require those in power to summon their sense of decency and stand up for what's right.\n\nOne thing I love is just how reverentially Smith treats the job he's about to undertake. First of all, he knows it's not about him. He's also not sure how well he'll do, but says \"I can promise you one thing: I'll do nothing to disgrace the office of United States Senator.\" After dropping off his crateful of pigeons (lol), we then see him wide-eyed as he tours the landmarks of Washington DC. The shot Capra gets of him beneath the giant statue of Lincoln perfectly captures his humility, and others the deep respect he has for the institution he's going to serve. We get a heavy dose of the ideals the country aspires to, with shots of Lincoln's second inaugural address (\"With malice toward none, with charity for all\") and a recitation of a part of the Gettysburg address by a young boy, while his grandfather and an African-American man look on. It's quite flowery and may have the lip curling of every cynic who sees the film, thinking of all of the times America has done evil in the world, but just about to head into WWII was not one of those times, and regardless, I can't help but admire this scene. If only all of America's representatives went with a reverence for these ideals, respected the institutions from their hearts, and felt real humility and a need to not let down his or her constituents, or the leaders who came before them.\n\nEveryone else is aware of how the system in Washington actually works though, including the other senator (Rains), his handler (Eugene Pallette), and his secretary (Jean Arthur). Heck, even the young page who shows him to his seat is savvier. Smith says to the boy, \"I'm just going to sit around and listen,\" meaning that he feels he has a lot to learn and shouldn't go in with guns blazing. The kid answers \"That's the way to get re-elected,\" reflecting how deep the cynicism of the process runs. Later it's parenthetically said that \"You can't count on people voting. Half the time they don't vote.\" These little bits are pointing out the same thing, that while we may decry the state of government, at the same time, to make it better we need to be active participants in it.\n\nStewart is fantastic in the film, with lots of memorable moments, such as when he nervously reads his proposal for a boys camp on the senate floor, and then later when his eyes are opened to deep corruption, which includes his father's friend and mentor, Rains's character. When he takes the Senate floor to filibuster and angrily yells \"No, sir, I will not yield!\" it's a fine, fiery moment, with palpable tension between the two men. I also love the softer scene with Arthur where he channels Walt Whitman in quoting his father, a man who died fighting for the little guy and the free press: \"My dad had the right idea. He had it all worked out. He said: 'Son, don't miss the wonders that surround you. Every tree, every rock, every anthill, every star is filled with the wonders of nature.' He said, 'Have you ever noticed how grateful you are to see daylight after coming through a long dark tunnel? Well,' he said, 'always try to see life as if you'd just come out of a tunnel.'\"\n\nArthur turns in a solid performance with her character, who is also inspiring. She knows how congress operates, giving Stewart (and the viewer) a little tutorial, and then coaching him from the balcony. We see that her character is jaded, but that there is still a glimmer of idealism in her, and also a healthy amount of disgust for politics. \"You're half-way decent, you don't belong here,\" she tells Stewart. We see both of these characters go through the inevitable response to the ugliness of politics - considering leaving the aggravation and frustration of it all, because it's the fight of an underdog to try to change it, or to stay and fight, because that's the only way anything will ever change, and what great leaders have had to do too as well. As this is a Capra film, you can guess which one of these paths they take.\n\nIt's certainly an arduous path, as the political boss is incredibly powerful. There is real evil, greed, and corruption here, and Arnold plays his part perfectly. The scene where he tries to get Smith to play ball is reminiscent of Potter calling George Bailey into his office in 'It's a Wonderful Life,' and has a similar outcome. When Smith stands up in revulsion, the boss immediately turns to Plan B, which is crush him. He does what corrupt and deceitful people in politics have always done - he drums up charges of the very same things he is guilty of against those who oppose them. He also uses his power over the press to wage a misinformation and propaganda war. Maybe you'll recognize these patterns from the present day.\n\nThe ending is a little messy, and I would have liked it more had Smith somehow been shown swaying the other senators with arguments and reason. How does one reach across the aisle and bridge such a gap of disagreement and entrenched special interests? However, I have to give the film credit for shining a light on corruption in politics, and I loved how its truthful message was so powerful that many offended politicians branded the film as communist propaganda. As Smith says, what's needed in politics is \"plain, ordinary, everyday kindness. And a little looking out for the other fellow too.\" Indeed."

        "review_detailed_main": "James Stewart and Frank Capra. One needn't know much more going in to be assured that this will be an enjoyable film. Together they take on the Washington elite with this dramatic comedy about a na\u00efve Washington outsider who gets appointed to the Senate and stands alone against corruption and graft. Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) is appointed from an unnamed state after one of its Senators dies. He is appointed because the political fat cats need someone who will not seem like a crony, but who will not stand in the way of a graft scheme for a pork barrel dam that will make bigwig Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold) millions. When the wide eyed Smith gets to Washington, he discovers the corrupt bill because the dam will stand in the way of his own proposed bill for a children's camp. When he tries to stop the project, Taylor's political machine frames him to make it seem like he is the one taking graft. This leads to the dramatic confrontation in the Senate, where Smith filibusters in an attempt to get the truth out.\n\nThis film is wonderful in so many ways. The story is a classic struggle between good and evil. In typical Capra style, the protagonist and antagonists are exaggerated so there is no confusion as to who are the good guys and who are the bad guys. If there is one clear message in Capra's films it is that those with strong moral fiber never give up hope. He likes to create utterly hopeless situations for characters to test their integrity, and rewards unswerving adherence to basic values and principles by triumph against the odds.\n\nI was dismayed to see a comment, obviously from a young viewer of this film, that said that the characters weren't realistic because no one used profanity. This is a sad testimonial to our culture, when it inconceivable to young people that there was once a time when profanity was the exception and not the rule.\n\nStewart is brilliant as the idealistic and awe struck kid from the backwoods who is overwhelmed by the glory of Washington, with its monuments and history. The story brings us a confrontation between political expediency and idealistic principles with the message that the truly great men are the ones that don't compromise their principles to hold on to power. Stewart also brings a whole treasure chest of bumbling comedic sight gags that make him all the more lovable in the part.\n\nJean Arthur is fabulous as the tough and savvy assistant who is jaded by Washington politics, but gets a fresh injection of fervor as she listens to Smith's noble homespun philosophies. Claude Rains is also masterful as the adulterated Senator, who sold his soul to corruption for a chance at the presidency. He plays the simultaneous sense of guilt and ambition with a torment that is clearly ripping his heart out, and the power of both emotions portrayed in his performance makes his character both repugnant and pitiable.\n\nThis film is a national treasure. It is in my top 50 list of all time. The story of corruption in politics and the greatness of the men who resist it is timeless and would not be lost on the politicians in Washington today. A 10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Now, I must admit that this is one of my top five favorite films. There is a warmth, idealism, and kinda simple feeling of hope, that makes one believe that things will work out in the end. Capra knew exactly what he wanted, and it shines. Jimmy Stewart, in the role of his life, makes us believe, what we know is almost impossible in todays crass world.\n\nClaude Rains is incredible as Senator Smith's evil mentor. Jean Arthur, as his confidant, plays the part so well,that we just want her to save the day.\n\nThe final scene, where the filibuster is taking place, is among the greatest ever made.\n\nBUT THE PROOF, YOU ASK?\n\nIn the early 80s, I showed this film, over three days, to a group of 15 year old inner city teenagers. I taught Political Science in a very difficult school in Chicago. It was a new class, and not all of the \"best\" students took it.\n\nI decided to show this film at the end of the year, just to see how long I could keep the students attention. I didn't expect much. Fifteen is a very tough age to keep any kind of attention span, and it was at the end of the day, 2:30 -3:15 pm. which made things worse. As the film began, there was rustling in the seats, boredom, that famous oh what a waste of time look...Mind you, this is 43 year old film, about a white Senator, in those \"old\" days, and being shown to a totally Afro-American crowd of 15 year olds, late in the day, (over a three day period, which meant the students would have to wait till the next day to see what was going on. ..By the end of the third day, Capra had worked his magic, and the entire class was spellbound by this film. They were there till the very end, and you could see how much they enjoyed seeing a film, that they wouldn't have looked at in a thousand years..Comments were wonderful. Any film that could accomplish this, more than 40 years after its conception, to a crowd that no one would believe would have any interest in, deserves to be truly called a \"great film.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "Since the beginning of the art form, movies have generally fallen into two categories: the realistic, and the fantastic (fantasy-based). There are some that point out that the films of Frank Capra unduly fall into the latter, that they are completely far-fetched and fastened in their own time, and even invented a pejorative term \"Capra-esque\" to describe any non-cynical, heartwarming picture that has a message. His great films, like It Happened One Night, It's a Wonderful Life, and of course, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, however, are not fixed in a single era, but all eras, the truest definition of a classic. And considering it was released among true powerhouses in 1939, a year as important to movies as 1998 was to baseball, its ideals, story, and general excellence shine as bright today as it did over 60 years ago.\n\nA Senator from an unnamed, middle America state dies and a new one must be appointed by Governor Hubert Hopper, a puppet whose strings are held by newspaper magnate Jim Taylor. They need to find one that would be easily controlled by the now-senior Senator Joseph Paine (played brilliantly by Claude Rains), so a bill allowing a building of a dam near land by the Willett Creek owned by Taylor can pass in the Senate. After his initial choice is rejected by Taylor, and Taylor's handpicked man is shot down by the public, the governor chooses Jefferson Smith, played to perfection by James Stewart, a boy scout leader and local hero who is both wholly idealistic in his patriotism for America but naive and blind to the actual process. After he gets embarrassed by the local print media, Mr. Smith begins to learn the harsh realities of DC. Paine, Smith's boyhood hero, takes him under his wing and suggests that Smith try to create a bill. Smith agrees, and with his assistant, Clarissa Saunders (played by Jean Arthur), they create a bill to create a campground for boys from all over the country to learn about each other and the civic process, much to the initial dissuasion by Saunders. Smith then wants to choose a site near the Willett Creek, the same site where the dam is to be built and when his superiors and true string-pullers find that out, major complications ensue.\n\nAlthough the basic premise is David vs. Goliath, the story is wholly originally and was probably one of the earliest pictures to suggest the government as corrupt. The characters are played excellently by all principal actors, with Mr. Smith you root for whole-heartedly, Mr. Taylor you root against for his sheer arrogance and greed, and Mr. Paine, who you pity as you see a man who lost his initial zest to serve the public and is now a jaded shell of his former self. A great performance was given by Harry Carey, Sr., who plays the Vice President/President of the Senate for comic relief. The lines where completely believable and the parts of Smith's final filibuster that were shown give the most impact. There is a beautifully shot scene with images of the monuments and sights of Washington with several national anthems synchronized as the score. The climax is as tension-packed as drama can get, and while the ending may seem rather sudden, and everything isn't completely or neatly resolved, it works perfectly and ends the movie on a happy note.\n\nObviously, few if any people elected to public office has the moral character, conviction, and general good heartedness of Jefferson Smith, and I doubt whether the government would be better if it was. The movie showed an ideal, a supposed \"lost cause\" of truth in government. And although it is next to impossible for Capra and the eternal good guy Jimmy Stewart to ever fully change the world of politics with just a motion picture, at least it shows that maybe once in a great while, being the good guy has its definite rewards. If (using the same analogy of the 1998 baseball season) The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind were the Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa of 1939 moviemaking, then this would be like Cal Ripken voluntarily ending his Iron Man Streak, something done with full class and the highest respect in mind, and that elevates an ideal of being the good guy and sticking to your dedication brings the greatest of riches. This picture is flawless in all respects and a true classic, with thought-provoking ideas, wit, a little bit of platonic romance, and an excellent cinematography and score, and deserves the rank as a 10 out of 10. And in giving this rating, either I'm damn right or I'm crazy."

The people pulling the strings in his party and State figure that he will be compliant and malleable and basically stay out of the way of their plans, some of which aren't entirely ethical, or legal. However, a well-intentioned deed sets off a dramatic chain of events, a series of events that will see him at odds with his colleagues, with the shadowy, bullying powerbrokers and with the entire Senate.\n\nBrilliant movie from Frank Capra. While Capra also gave us such great movies as It's A Wonderful Life, Meet John Doe and It Happened One Night, this is his greatest work. A superb indictment of politics and how democracy has been undermined and corrupted, told with the trademark Capra brand of wholesomeness and practical idealism. Considering how politics has even further degenerated since 1939, even more relevant today than when it was released in 1939.\n\nClever, engaging plot that doesn't waiver for a second. Not an ounce of deadwood in the movie - every scene is perfect and important. Some great twists and turns and some great tension towards the end as Smith struggles to preserve his name and ideals. Wonderful themes and morals too, as you would expect from Frank Capra.\n\nAdd in some excellent performances, especially from James Stewart in the lead role and Jean Arthur as Ms Saunders. Both received Oscar nominations, as did Harry Carey for playing the President of the Senate.\n\nIn all, Mr Smith Goes To Washington was nominated for 11 Oscars, including Best Picture, but won only one, for best original screenplay.

When a senator dies in Smith's state, the governor is forced into an awkward position of electing the new senator. While the governor is sitting down to dinner, his young children propose the idea of Jeff Smith who is head of the Boy Rangers and prints a weekly newspaper for the local children. Mr. Smith is elected into office in the funniest way, a coin toss.\n\nWhen Mr. Smith arrives in Washington with his colleague Mr. Pain, (Claude Rains) he is amazed by all the greatness that Washington possesses. After being sworn into the Senate Mr. Smith comes up with idea to propose a Bill that would let boys come together and enjoy the wilderness, and the perfect spot would be in his home town next to a creek. What he doesn't know is that his colleague Mr. Pain has his own plans with that same land. The film then releases the full fury of what corrupt politicians can do to a truthful man.\n\nThe plot of the film will grab the viewer within the first five minutes and will not let go until the astonishing end. Even though this type of thing is implausible it's still very funny and unique in its own way.\n\nThe acting was superb! James Stewart will always represent the good guy trying to make his way through life in an honorable way. Claude Rains character was perfect for him, a good man gone bad by the power of politics. Jean Arthur's character was something that isn't normally seen in the movies. She played an ambitious woman trying to get to the top without anyone's help, but is still the great old fashioned woman she was born to be. James Stewart and Jean Arthur were very charismatic together. There could not have been a better pair.\n\nThe lighting in the film was great in two scenes when Mr. Smith is at the Washington memorial the light shines on sentences of the constitution that added a lot to the emotion of the character and helped set the tone for the scene.\n\nThis is a classic film that should be recognized and cherished forever. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a great film for the whole family, the film is not only captivating and genuine but there is also a moral in the story. Definitely a ten out of ten, and should be part of your home video library."

Quickly he becomes angered by the misleading press articles after he dips his toe into political waters. He also learns of the lack of expertise of congressmen and the process it takes to actually pass a law. Getting his feet wet with his first harmless bill proposal comes in direct conflict with a plan a few corrupt congressmen have been planning. Looks like this is shaping up for an honest man up against established and scheming congressmen who are heavily influenced from outsiders. Stewart carries the picture as his emotions range from frustration, pleading, anger to exhaustion of trying to prove an honest point. I imagine the inner workings of congress today as even more frustrating and bewildering."

Better yet, it is Frank Capra, with James Stewart. Can we get any more clich\u00e9? Oh, wait. The main character is a Jefferson Smith.\n\nBribery, corruption, conspiracy, lies and deceit. It is all here. Shady deals, ulterior motives. In other words, politics.\n\nIn case it was not already obvious, I am not very political. But guess what? In all the above ways, yes, this is like all those other films. But it the most important ways, it is not.\n\nWhat makes it different? In one word, Stewart. Sure, the clever writing, the directing, the supporting cast are all assets to the film. But he makes this film. His character's name is in the title, after all. Through his heartfelt performance as Jefferson Smith, the audience is inspired; even the most cynical of us might find ourselves beginning to really like this country, appreciate what we have today that our ancestors did not, and maybe even believe that we can make a difference by getting involved in politics. His naivet\u00e9 is practically excruciating at times. His first glance at the White House can be compared to a little kid in a candy store. His first evening exploring all the monuments along and around the National Mall is shown in montage form with patriotic backgrounds music. Cheesy, yes. But somehow it was not as bad as it sounds. As he, an everyday man, tries to acclimate himself in the world of politics, each blunder brings new laughs. His awkwardness in palpable and his character lovable. Eventually, of course, he must learn the truth- that it does not really exist in the government. We all cheer for this everyday Smith as he tries to pave the way for all the little guys. As far as high school or even grade school education goes, this should be on a list of required viewings. Along with School House Rock's classic \"How a Bill Becomes a Law\", of course. I would have loved to learn about government, the Senate, bills, and filibusters this way.\n\n**** Spoilers ****\n\nSadly, it was the ending that brought the greatest disappointment. It was extremely sudden and cheap. After all that determination and rallying from Smith; after how far Paine was willing to go to condemn the man he supposedly felt was \"like a son\" to him, after all his stubbornness to do the right thing, he gives up and confesses everything on the Senate floor? Highly unlikely. Even worse, it cheapens all that Smith has done."

        "review_detailed_main": "Critics of \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" will call it cheesy, saccharine, and over-the-top in its character portrayals. Truth be told, I really can't call those critiques \"wrong\". But the thing is, this is such an endearing, aspirational film that I'm always able to look past the cheese-factor and enjoy the performances and overall message.\n\nFor a very basic overview, 'Mr. Smith Goes To Washington\" tells the story of Jefferson Smith (James Stewart), a wide-eyed, aww-shucks, country boy rube who gets nominated for a U. S. Senate seat in large part to be a straight-ticket voter for the political machine of Senator Joseph Paine (Claude Rains). Once in Washington, however, both get a rude awakening: Smith discovers the graft in politics, while Paine begins to realize--to his horror--that Smith isn't just going to \"tow the party line\".\n\nThis movie remains an all-time classic for me because of the earnestness of its message. It isn't quite as perfect as Capra's more famous \"It's A Wonderful Life\", but I do see similarities between the two pictures. Here, the story strikes such a simple--yet highly emotional--chord. Though deep down I think we all realize that corruption and compromise are likely unavoidable aspects of politics, we like to cling to ideals of honesty and supreme integrity. That is precisely the journey that Smith takes viewers on. This isn't \"politics as it is\", but rather \"politics as we want it to be\", and I think there is equal room for both in politically-minded films.\n\nOf course, casting Stewart is the cherry on top of all this. I'm not sure there has been a better individual born to play the Jefferson Smith role. His stuttering, stammering, \"golly gee whiz\" routine is perfect, yet when the chips are down he delivers a filibuster monologue almost guaranteed to have you in tears. Rains is fine as the corrupt Senator and Jean Arthur has a nice sidekick supporting role, but \"Mr. Smith Goes To Washington\" is memorable because of Stewart. I very much liken his performance here to that of Henry Fonda's in \"12 Angry Men\". It's what we all wish we could be like--but know we'll probably never quite get there.\n\nThe only reason I can't give this a full 10 stars? It was made in 1939--or back when Hollywood didn't really know how to properly end movies other than an emotional flourish and a fade to black. With a less-rushed, more nuanced endgame, this one could have ascended even higher.\n\nOverall, though, I consider this to be one of my favorite political films of all time. Make all the gritty, tough governmental thrillers you want (I love some of those too!), but I hold steady that a more aspirational, positive-minded effort like this isn't out-of-date or irrelevant simply because of that nature."

        "review_detailed_main": "... since James Stewart is really not a lead in \"Philadelphia Story\". Instead he was more of a supporting actor there. But the Academy probably felt they should have given Stewart the Best Actor trophy for this film and were just correcting a bit of history, which they have often done over the years. But I digress.\n\nIn an unnamed state - because if Capra had named it they would have sued - a sitting senator dies. The corrupt state political machine ends up appointing babe-in-the-woods Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) to fill the seat because they see him as so naive that they can control him. His dad, a newspaper editor, was murdered when he was fighting for a lost cause. Smith's dad's lifelong friend happens to be his state's senior senator, Joseph Paine (Claude Rains).\n\nIt so happens that Paine is in on the plan to put forth a bill that will build an unneeded damn on land that has been bought up by state machine puppet master Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold) so that he can get a big payout from the federal government. Paine has justified this and a hundred other corrupt acts over the years by the thousand ways he has served his state honestly. Selling oneself to the devil is seldom done in a single transaction. The problem is that Smith wants to use the same land to build a summer camp for boys, and in the process he learns of the corrupt land deal he was never supposed to know about. Complications that involve famous cinematic history ensue.\n\nToday, post Watergate, it's hard to believe that somebody such as Jefferson Smith could exist as an adult who knows so much about American history but nothing about corruption in government to the point he is flabbergasted by it. Lots has been said about Stewart's performance, with him rising from playing in all kinds of inane and minor MGM films to a leading man in an American classic in just a couple of years. But consider Claude Rains's performance. Rains portrays a complex character who struggles with his conscience and past choices and it is killing him that he has to betray the son of his best friend the way that he does. He is an essential gray character in a bunch of black and white ones.\n\nApparently this received lots of backlash during its release for portraying US Senators as folks capable of being corrupted through money. Maybe that was unrealistic for the 1930's, but in 2023, this film is practically a documentary."

        "review_detailed_main": "It was a lot of fun watching Mr. Smith Goes to Washington in a class where the professor noted how this was the sort of film that was of historical importance while not taking itself too seriously. And I think that's the way Frank Capra wanted it, in a sense. Perhaps in the time of 1939 America this film was seen as being of merit to the American Government's due (though according to the trivia, it was denounced at showing corruption and even banned for showing how democracy \"works\"). But the director is also wanting to make an entertaining movie, of the kind of Hollywood appeal that brings 8-to-80 years olds in attendance. What had me interested throughout, particularly in that climactic, rousing twenty-minute sequence in the Senate with Jimmy Stewart's constant, un-faltering filibuster, is how it really is a patriotic kind of bravura to be shown on the screen. Here is how it SHOULD be done, to an extreme perhaps, in getting things done in government. But at the same time, Capra keeps it entirely watchable with that group of kids up on the balcony, keeping the audience laughing and smiling all the way through the great lines that Stewart says. \"Great principles don't get lost once they come to light. They're right here; you just have to see them again!\" This is a kind of talent that I'm sure few other filmmakers at the time, or even after, could have pulled off.\n\nThe rest of the film isn't just Stewart's struggle to be heard as a young, new-in-town senator. It's also a witty, more often than not true look of how government tends to really work as opposed to how it should. Basically, the core of the story is the fish-out-of-water type, where Stewart's Jefferson Smith (one of his better Hollywood performances), leader of the Boy Rangers is called to be the senator of his state. He has a childhood hero in town in the form of a senior senator (Claude Rains, terrific as always). And there's even a woman (Jean Arthur) in the mix that's growing an interest in him, at first dubious. But despite the corruption that is almost thrust upon smith by Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold, as skilled a character actor as could be asked for), Smith fights it all the way to his final filibuster, which includes a reading from the Constitution, in-and-out cheers from the Boy Rangers, and general guffaws from the other senators. In other words, it's really much in that pure spirit of Frank Capra that 'Mr. Smith' is working in, and even at its cheesiest and sometimes most-dated moments, it's a very successful picture for what it wants to do. It's really an equal-opportunity kind of film about people in politics that should be able decades later to appeal to both the hopeful and the cynical, and it works as good as it does a comedy as it does a piece to show in history of film or American government course."

The Stewart character represents what we need as leaders to run this great nation of ours. Some real scene stealing is done by Claude Rains as the other state's senator who has become corrupt. His temperament is perfect for the part. His seething by guilt and his denunciation of his fellow senator shows depth in acting. His outburst at the end of the film is totally memorable. He claims that he has compromised to get what he wants. How far from the truth this really is! Jean Arthur, as the secretary in the know, is truly fabulous as well. Newspapers can learn from this film. They should. Censorship still exists in 2006.\n\nRemember that great filibuster scene? Stewart acted his heart out. Though he lost the coveted Oscar here, the Academy rewarded him the following year for the comedy \"The Philadelphia Story.\"\n\nThis film should be a definite pre-requisite for students in political science classes."

        "review_detailed_main": "What a wonderful film. What an exaggerated, corny, fantastic, beautifully acted, exciting, wonderful film.\n\n\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" is a classic for good reason. It reinforces qualities that many of us have lost along the way: idealism, strong, unshakable belief, never quitting, honesty, and commitment. Today, patriotism and \"American values\" have taken on another connotation. They have become the property of the right wing. But there isn't anything wrong with the kind of patriotism and American values expressed by Jefferson Smith, which are different from what is being expressed today.\n\nIs anyone today as idealistic as Mr. Smith was when he first came to Washington? Can one really win against a powerful force like the Taylor machine? As one who was involved in a legal case where the other side had all the clout and all the money, I sadly have to answer that I don't think so. In the real world, as Court TV has taught us, things don't work that way. Is anyone as corrupt as Senator Paine and Jim Taylor? Sadly, I'd have to say probably. Would they ruin anyone who got in their way? Yes. Have they? Definitely.\n\n\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" is a fantasy, but it's a fantasy that uplifts us and reminds us of what we could be and, like Jean Arthur says in the film, maybe being jaded isn't such a good idea all the time.\n\nJames Stewart had the role of a lifetime, and he was perfect. Homespun, intelligent, boyishly good-looking, his career and tremendous popularity even today speak for themselves. His filibuster scenes are incredible, passionate, and strong. We were lucky we had him as long as we did. There will never be another. Jean Arthur was fabulous in her role as a streetwise assistant who finds something to believe in. Claude Rains, as the unlikable, weak Senator Paine, gives a powerful performance. The bad guys - and Capra always makes sure they're real bad - were all great. As for Harry Carey, the sympathetic speaker, you want to hug him. A fantastic job.\n\nFrank Capra knew how to make movies. The pace is swift, the story strong, and the scenes tense and exciting. One gets caught up in the world he fashions. A shame it isn't real."

        "review_detailed_main": "Few films succeed in being relevant a decade or two after its release, but Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is still relevant 77 years later, especially in a voting year with questionable candidates.\n\nBefore Frank Capra ventured into his war propaganda films in the early-to-mid 40's, he made some of the most important and acclaimed films of all time. In back to back years he directed the 1938 sleeper hit, You Can't Take it With You, and the classic Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Capra carried some of the same cast members over to the ladder, as Jimmy Stewart, Jean Arthur, and Edward Arnold are among the many who acted in both films. Continuing with the tradition of Capra's other works, Mr. Smith deals with a common man taking on big ideas and ideals, only to be shut down by those more powerful and privileged.\n\nThis was the film that really showed the world what Stewart could do. Even though I have seen tons of his films, this one stands out as some of his finest acting and most demanding roles of his filmography. He was always great at playing an every-man and someone you can undeniably root for, and Jeff Smith is a defining role for him. Smith represents the audience in going along for this political ride and I loved the way Stewart gave the character a certain amount of innocence and vulnerability while also displaying a graceful and powerful presence as well.\n\nHaving wonderful chemistry in You Can't Take it With You, it's no surprise that Stewart and Arthur's work together here is just as good, if not better. Arthur plays Clarissa Saunders, who manages to keep Smith afloat even though he's constantly swept away by Washington and all of the extra perks for being in the Senate. It's also not a forced romance, like a lot of 30's films, it takes a while for it to be developed as its handled with care. Arthur may very well be the best romantic partner Stewart ever had.\n\n1939 was a fantastic year for film, with Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind also being released. But perhaps no film from that year is still as relevant as Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Capra covers the film with patriotism with beautiful shots of Washington D.C. and a patriotic song here or there, but its his step into a pessimistic style of filmmaking that's most intriguing here. The last 30 minutes with Stewart giving an Oscar worthy performance and Capra seamlessly twisting the story into unpredictable territories is truly something special.\n\n+Stewart becoming the Stewart we all love\n\n+Arthur is marvelous\n\n+Capra's balanced directing\n\n10/10"

In fact, man versus machine is one of the oldest forms of conflict in cinema, but this is a different kind of \"machine,\" this \"Taylor Machine.\" When a young, naive, and idealistic man by the name of Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) is placed, as a pawn, in the United States Senate, he is honored and humbled by the job set out before him. He sees it as an opportunity to provide a service for his country, and, even more so, his people. In Jefferson Smith, we see everything that is good and wholesome in America. One man who wishes for nothing more than an improvement upon a country that he already cherishes. He intends to do everything he can to fulfill his duty as a newly appointed Senator. However, the people that put him there were not nearly as patriotic in their intentions. Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold) and Senator Joseph Harrison Paine (Claude Rains) have conspired to put Smith in office in hopes that he will simply sit there and keep quiet while they pass a bill that will profit Taylor. Smith's dream of building a national boy's camp is shattered by Taylor's scheme to build a dam in the same area. The powerful Jim Taylor is forced to pull some strings in order to discredit the young senator so that his dam can be built. The Taylor Machine frames Smith, accusing him of fraud. Shamed, Smith is ready to leave Washington behind when his assistant, Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur) inspires him to fight for his ideals just as his forefathers had. Smith returns to congress, armed with a new strategy to accomplish his goal.\n\nJames Stewart gives one of his finest performances as Jefferson Smith, the young, passionately patriotic Senator confronting corruption in the government he holds so dear. Jean Arthur's performance as Clarissa Saunders is strong, while Claude Rains is forced to counter Stewart's inspired intensity (a feat that I feel he accomplishes). The filibuster scene is one of the highlights of the film, and one of the more memorable sequences in American cinema. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a wonderful movie, not just because of James Stewart's relentless performance, but because it has quite a bit to say. It is a statement declaring that ideals are stronger than the pages they are printed on, and that it is our ideals and the spirit through which we see them realized that allows one man to topple \"the machine.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "Patriotic, stirring, uplifting, absolutely mesmerizing\u0085 Here are just a few words that can be used to describe Frank Capra's brilliant 1939 film, 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.' Bringing together a stellar cast of both fresh and seasoned actors, Capra manages to reach into each of our chests, and wrench almost painfully at our heartstrings.\n\nJefferson Smith (James Stewart, 'It's A Wonderful Life'), is a young, enthusiastic patriot who resides in an unnamed American state, but is known throughout it (most especially by the young boys of the region) as an unsung hero. Head of the Boy Rangers, Smith has a love of his country and of nature, once quenching a potentially devastating forest fire single-handedly. After the unexpected death of a current Senator, Governor Hubert Hopper (Guy Kibbee) is forced to choose a replacement. Whilst his corrupt political boss, Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold), urges him to appoint a handpicked stooge, Hopper surprisingly decides to follow the confident advice of his own children, awarding the job to Smith.\n\nSmith arrives in Washington, excited and idealistic, no doubt modestly considering himself to be unsuitable for such a prestigious position. He is proud to accompany the other current state Senator, Joseph Harrison Paine (Claude Rains, 'Notorious'), a highly-esteemed man who was once great friends with Smith's father. Unbeknownst to Smith, however, Paine had long ago abandoned his political ideals, seduced by the promise of power and political longevity to make \"certain compromises.\" Whilst Smith works tirelessly to submit a bill regarding the creation of a national boy's camp at Willet Creek, which he hopes will teach a new generation the value of freedom and liberty, the devious Paine schemes to dam that same locality, an act that will serve nobody but the power-hungry Jim Taylor. When Paine's cynical secretary, Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur), informs Smith of these plans, he determinedly attempts to speak his mind, only to be quashed by the almighty \"Taylor Machine.\"\n\nFrank Capra, who had previously supplied Columbia Pictures Corporation with two Academy Award Best Picture winners ('It Happened One Night,' 1934 and 'You Can't Take It With You,' 1938), once again proved his undeniable genius, something he would continue to do throughout his film-making career. One often-cited example involves the romantically-awkward Smith's second encounter with Paine's beautiful daughter, Susan (Astrid Allwyn). Rather than focusing on faces, as would be the typical style for such a scene, Capra keeps the camera firmly on Smith's hat, as he restlessly shuffles it between his fingers, frequently dropping it to the floor and stooping to reclaim it. This shot tells us more about Smith than any facial close-up ever could!\n\nFinally, James Stewart is unquestionably brilliant as the young, idealistic Smith, in one of his first critically recognised roles. The look of absolute awe and wonderment on his face upon first witnessing the Capitol Dome appears truly genuine, despite the fact that Stewart was merely acting against a projection. For his highly memorable filibuster speech at the climax of the film, Stewart dried out his throat with bicarbonate of soda to make himself sound hoarse, an act that could potentially have destroyed his later ability to speak. As we witness Jefferson Smith, ragged and exhausted, determinedly continuing to shout hoarsely at the Senate members, we immediately understand that his voice is reaching much, much further. He is not just shouting at the Senate, but he is shouting at the people; he is shouting at his country; he is shouting at us. And we are right there alongside him, quietly urging him along."

        "review_detailed_main": "After a vacancy opens, Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) is appointed to be the junior senator of some western state (Montana in the book). He does not know much about the procedures of the Senate, but quickly gets a crash course on how politics works. His one and only project he wants to push through, a boys camp, turns out to be a very contentious issues.\n\nThis film has been nominated for and won a number of awards. And why not? It's an interesting tale of an ordinary man who goes to the government to get something fairly normal done. It's a film many people could identify with. I think it is also a strength of the film that no one is ever identified as a Republican or Democrat, essentially making it a story about civics and not about politics.\n\nI was not impressed with the cinematography, including the \"hat shot\" where the camera follows Smith's hat to show how awkward he is, or the use of the \"soft lens\", which just strikes me as blurry and ineffective. A face and music can be more powerful than a fuzzy frame.\n\nAll in all a great film, though perhaps a bit long for some people's tastes. James Stewart is great as always (though I prefer the more mature Stewart), Jean Arthur is a decent female lead, and Jean Arthur's hats really do a fine job in the supporting actor role."

        "review_detailed_main": "`Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' is not as well known of a movie as it should be. It is a very good movie that is very interesting and a very good way to learn how some things involving the Senate work. This reviewer absolutely loved this movie and wishes she could run out and buy it right now. It definitely grabs the audience's attention and keeps it there. While watching this movie, this reviewer was laughing, smiling, getting really, really angry, learning, and even getting a little teary-eyed. How can a movie that brings out all those different emotions in someone not be great, or even spectacular! `Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' is definitely one of the best movies ever made despite the fact that it is mostly about politics! It's still interesting!\n\nWhile watching this movie, the audience might be thinking that the acting isn't half bad and is actually quite realistic. They would be right too! All of the acting is really very good and it draws the audience in and keeps them in. This movie was so close to not having one single cheesy line or unbelievable acting job that it's really a shame that it did. At the very end of the movie Saunders, played by , stands up from her seat in the balcony and yells `Stop Jeff! Stop!' and then falls to the floor. The line and the way says it is very, very cheesy and something the audience might find themselves laughing at. That line is just about the only time in the entire movie where the acting was lacking. James Stewart was, of course, phenomenal. He is a very good actor and one that should be remembered for a very long time. He's awesome!\n\nThe only other not so great thing about `Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' is the ending. It's a happy ending but, well, it just ends. It's an abrupt ending. It ends so abruptly that the audience isn't even expecting it to end when it does. It has one of those endings where the audience knows a bunch of things that will be happening, they just aren't shown happening. This reviewer doesn't really care for those kind, it is much better when you get to see the things carried out. Although the ending could have been better `Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' is still an awesome movie and the ending doesn't take away from that at all!\n\nThis movie is so great that every person in the world should be able to see it because it is definitely worth the time it takes to see it."

        "review_title": "Naive And Cynical At The Same Time",
        "review_detailed_main": "You have to appreciate a movie that manages to be both hopelessly naive and bitingly cynical at the same time, and that still manages to make everything work. The great strength of this movie is James Stewart in the role of the newly appointed (much to his surprise) Senator Jefferson Smith, sent to Washington by his unnamed state's governor to fill a vacancy created by the death of the incumbent. Of course, Smith wasn't really appointed by the Governor. The Governor (and Smith's senior Senator) were just tools of the state political machine - a role Smith is expected to fulfil. But he's ill suited to the job. Jefferson was the leader of the Boy Rangers, who's spent his adulthood instilling into the boys pride in America and democracy and who isn't about to give in when he stumbles across corruption being planned by the machine, which then sets out to destroy him as quickly as it made him.\n\nStewart was great in this role. His wide-eyed wonder at seeing Washington for the first time; his social awkwardness and shyness; his genuine humility (not believing that he belongs in the Senate); and finally his growing contempt for the corrupt system he discovers - these are all portrayed absolutely perfectly by Stewart. The movie is his, backed by a strong supporting cast - but it's his.\n\nThe mix of naivete and cynicism might seem an awkward fit, but it worked surprisingly well. The portrayal of life on the floor of the Senate was also interestingly shown. The \"scandal\" Smith gets embroiled in (as he's framed by the machine) plays out far too quickly to be believable, and yet you feel his anguish and despair over his reputation being attacked and his honesty called into question. In an age in which attack-style politics is now the accepted norm, it was nice to see the decent, honest guy who just wants to do what's right triumph against the corrupt mud-slingers. This is a very enjoyable movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Jimmy Stewart stars as Jefferson Smith, the leader of the Boy Rangers who was appointed by Governor Hopper (Guy Kibbe) as a new U.S. senator for his state. Realizing him having no prior political experience and his naivety, Hopper thought that Smith would be easy to manipulate. Once in Washington, Smith discovers the downsides of the political process as his first piece of legislation he introduced, producing a national boys' camp, leads to a conflict with state political boss Jim Taylor. Taylor tries to corrupt Smith and then attempts to destroy his reputation through a scandal, hoping to lead to his expulsion from the Senate. In on the scheme is the crooked Senator Joseph Paine (Claude Rains).\n\nHaving first watched this film in a college government class, this movie is both educational and fascinating. You get to learn part of the legislative process of the U.S. Senate, including introduction of bills, the committee process and the filibuster. And, you get to see a good piece of cinema work with a captivating story and superb acting, from the corrupted Jim Taylor and Senator Paine concocting their scheme for political gain to the courageous Senator Smith trying to beat the political machine to seek the truth and fight for his constituents. Having the odds stacked against him, Smith presses on, showing the audience that even in a machine as big or tainted as the U.S. Senate or any other political institution could still yield a man of integrity and honesty. At the same time, you get to see the U.S. Senate in action, letting us see the political powerhouses as they debate the laws that will eventually affect our country.\n\nEven for a drama-genred golden oldie that is over two hours long, Director Frank Capra really kept the plot's momentum going strong and screen writers Sidney Buchman, Lewis R. Foster, and Myles Connolly wrote a fascinating script that really attracts the audience's attention. I thoroughly enjoyed this film - it is highly recommended.\n\nGrade A"

        "review_detailed_main": "Thomas Mitchell was one of the greatest American stage and screen actors of all time. His accomplishments as a fine performer of great range are legendary. Whether on the stage as Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman or on the screen in the moving family drama Make Way for Tomorrow--Mitchell's roles were always carefully crafted, honest, believable and engrossing.\n\nThe year 1939 was the diamond jeweled crown of the Golden Age of Hollywood. Books have been written on the subject. And 1939 contains five Mitchell films that represent the art of Hollywood moviemaking at its very peak. Four of them are bona fide classics (Stagecoach, Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, Gone With The Wind and Hunchback Of Notre Dame), and one of them (Stagecoach) earned him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor of 1939. Only Angels Have Wings may have been a notch below the other 1939 Mitchell films simply because there should be a quantifiable difference between the rankings of \"Excellent\" and \"Outstanding.\"\n\nIn Mt. Smith Goes To Washington, Thomas Mitchell revisits the pal/buddy role he played so effectively in Only Angels Have Wings. This time, his friend is Jean Arthur rather than Cary Grant, and the relationship is less emotional and accordingly more subdued. Mitchell is advisor, confidant, chum and platonic lover of Ms. Arthur. But out of a profound sense of personal decency and fairness, he shares his affections equally with the Mr. Smith character of James Stewart. In doing so, Mitchell supports the logic and honorable outcome of the story's final resolution. Wouldn't all of us like to have a real honest to goodness friend like reporter Diz Moore? No wonder that Frank Capra liked working with him so much.\n\nMitchell was able to create five very different superlative roles in these five fine 1939 films from Hollywood's Greatest Year. It is astonishing to realize that this assembly of cinematic excellence was all accomplished in the time span of just one year!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Superbly cast, acted, and directed with a gripping narrative and political observations that continue to resonate to this day, despite a tendency to slip into bathos, in particular at the conclusion. For me the most salient figure was Claude Rains' Senator Joseph Paine, representing a permanent fixture in all manner of political organisations of whatever stripe throughout the ages, the individual who starts as an idealist, but whom is corrupted by power, the system and above all by the immense continual pressure to do whatever is expedient. Such people inevitably do far more to further disenchantment with political causes than do the out and out crooks, if only because they are far more numerous. The story's major weakness in my view is that such an experienced type would use far more subtle tactics to take down and discredit an opponent. The ownership and control of the popular press to stampede the public and smear an individual is another time-honoured occurrence.\n\nThere is plenty of light relief too with James Stewart, Jean Arthur, and Thomas Mitchell particularly effective. The replication of the Senate was expertly achieved, with another superb performance from Harry Carey in the chair."

It looks lovely, the cinematography and scenery are delicious eye candy, while the film is richly scored, not to mention superbly directed by Capra.\n\nThe script is another outstanding asset, it is honest, funny and poignant. And then there is the superb acting, whether this is Stewart's best role is up for debate, personally I think not, but as the idealistic senator there is no denying he is superb here. Jean Arthur is wonderful too as the cynical secretary, Claude Rains is excellent as always but the best supporting performance comes from Harry Carey, who is magnificent as the vice president.\n\nOverall, a superb film, and in the top 5 of my favourite Capra movies. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

A strange and sometimes clumsy balance between naivety and cynicism, between cornball humor and mawkish sincerity, rooting out political corruption and skepticism while embracing patriotic idealism. Crowd-pleasing Capra-corn tactics aside, it's a reasonably well-made motion picture with too many flaws to ignore--including an abrupt and unbelievable ending--but its manipulation is too overpowering to dismiss out of hand. Star-making turn from relative-unknown Stewart (Arthur was even given top billing onscreen and in marketing materials), but it's Rains as a crooked politician that distinguishes himself best.\n\n75/100"

We live an an age when cynicism about politics is rife, when people who get involved to change things for the better are more often than not dismissed as naive; this is a film which everyone who is cynical towards politics should see. It doesn't hide the fact that there is corruption in politics, but it does say quite clearly that there is a point and a value to standing up to it.\n\nAs movie quotes go, Jean Arthur's words to Jeff Smith deserve to be remembered: \"Your friend Mr. Lincoln had his Taylors and Paines. So did every other man whoever tried to lift his thought up off the ground. Odds against 'em didn't stop those men. They were fools that way. All the good that ever came into this world came from fools with faith like that.\" This is a movie which can teach a very valuable lesson, particularly those who despair of modern politics.

It becomes a crash course in the inner workings of Washington for the new appointee and the viewer.\n\nJefferson Smith (James Stewart) was the man appointed to congress. There probably wasn't a better choice than James Stewart for this movie. He has the \"gee whiz\" sort of look and voice to make him perfectly believable as an idealistic sucker. He stepped foot into Washington and was awestruck. He was overflowing with reverence for the great men who'd been there and all the great words that had been written. His boy scout act was almost unbelievable, but it was no act. He was as patriotic and American as his name.\n\nSmith would come to realize that Washington wasn't about ideals, \"love thy neighbor,\" and the good of the country. Long before dark money congress was bought and paid for. Smith would find himself up against Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold) and the machine. Taylor was a rich fat cat who made politicians and therefore had them in his pocket. Among them was Jeff Smith's idol, Senator Joseph Paine (Claude Rains).\n\nI found myself rolling my eyes at Smith with the rest of his colleagues. A lot of older movies have an air of wholesomeness and unadulterated good that we have retroactively placed upon that era, but this movie made Smith saintly and naive which made him come off like a tool. The message of the movie was clear and good even if I didn't like the delivery of it."

Seriously Smith arrives to Washington and disappears for 5 hours without anyone knowing where he is. Then you do not think he is a guy from the countryside like Deeds was but just a plain idiot. Then the conflict arrives. They have planned the same land for a Dam and a boy scout camp. The camp could have been moved easily without anyones protest the rich backer could even have bought some other land for him and be standing as the hero. This just destroyed the premise of the movie that the conflict is based on nothing plausible.\n\nActors: Jean Arthur was lovely and played very well. Jimmy Stewart had better been replaced by Gary Cooper as in Deeds. Stewart of course did not have a lot to work with in this movie.\n\nConclusion: It may have made a large impact when it was made. But not in any way subtle about anything. You pretty fast get hammered into your head how good Smith is and how corrupt the rest of the politicians are. Funny thing is the movie ignores politics completely. Had they wanted to show how it works then they had just found a solution about moving the camp. A bogus conflict flush out all the corruption. There are loads of better movies and less preachy about corruption. See Mr. Deeds go to town instead as that is a real gem even though topic is not politics."

        "review_detailed_main": "Frank Capra's greatest movie is Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. It's his most well written, directed and arguably acted of all the films of his I've seen. The story is simple, Young, naive American Boy Scout leader Jefferson Smith is called to fill a vacant senate seat. He's full of optimism and wants to make a difference. But he soon learns that the senate is not as honest or honorable as he thought. Shocker right? He then must overcome these obstacles to make a difference. It's a story often imitated, never duplicated.\n\nJimmy Stewart couldn't have been more perfect for the role. He was someone that nearly anyone can identify with no matter their background. We've all faced adversity in our lives and Stewart as Jefferson Smith is one of the most understandable and likable characters he ever played. He's so brilliant here I'd dare say it was his best performance. His journey from a naive country loving man, to defeated Everyman, to courageous representative of the people is believable and great to watch. Don't forget the supporting cast. Jean Arthur plays Stewart's physical representation of his booster shot of reality. She's fun to watch here and plays a great foil to him. Of course there is also Claude Rains, one of the best supporting actors ever. Need I say more? He's brilliant here, moving on.\n\nThe story is both dramatic, funny and thought provoking. It was a brilliant satire of the US government to where congressmen from all over the country tried to stop its release. Thankfully they failed and everyone got to see this wonderful film.\n\nMost Capra movies never feel that dated. I think this movie has aged amazingly well. Smith's plea to the Senate to actually listen to the people, hear their concerns, try to improve their quality of life and preserve their rights is timeless. Their job is to represent and act, not just sit around trading insults all day.\n\nEven 80 years later, this movie is still relevant in many ways. It's poignant, powerful, funny, and filled to the brim with memorable characters and dialogue. Everyone, no matter what political beliefs you hold, need to see this movie. It can speak to anyone on either side of the spectrum. That's how powerful it is. This is one of the greatest movies ever made. Period. Now if only we had more Jefferson Smiths in Congress and less, well, I'll let you finish that sentence for yourself."

He's smeared by the corporate media (the Washington Press Club denounced the film as un-American after the world premiere) and his efforts to pass a bill to establish a local camp are sabotaged by the corporate political machine because it interferes with plans to build a dam on the same land. Seeing Smith as a liability, the corporate state goes into full character assassination mode, while Smith embarks on a filibuster in the Senate with the goal of exposing the corruption of the system. The brilliance of the film is that it shows how capitalist interests own and control the political system (a system that is set up as a distraction from that fact), and yet it doesn't allow Smith to be completely triumphant, which would have reinforced his idealism and proved the system can \"work\" if only good people are elected. The ending is left ambiguous and somewhat bleak as Smith proves his point but nothing is fundamentally changed. Jimmy Stewart gives a fantastic performance as Smith in this classic by Frank Capra."

        "review_detailed_main": "This super film brings together the talents of James Stewart and Frank Capra for one of many successful outings. Stewart is Jefferson Smith, who finds himself a Senator ill equipped for the corruption that surrounds him.\n\nIt's a brilliant turn from Stewart. He plays the naive yet thoroughly decent Smith with charm and wit, and is wonderfully supported by Jean Arthur as his assistant, Saunders. Her abject cynicism is slowly eroded by the innocent values of the new Senator, and she falls in love. This love story serves the story beautifully, as both actors and Capra tug at our heartstrings and draw us into the drama.\n\nThere is also fine support from Claude Rains as Joseph Paine, Smith's mentor, and Harry Carey as the President of the Senate.\n\nPut all of this together and you have a gem of a movie. The triumph of good over evil, the lone voice over the conglomerate, and small town values over big city corruption, added to a touching and affecting love story told with charm and humour, creates something very special. This is a film to make you feel better about the world and your fellow man. It's a beautiful piece of work."

The acting was amateurish, the cuts were disjointed, and the ending seemed abrupt.\n\nAt any rate, it gives you good insight into the kind of people behind the Republican party in America today (e.g. Taylor, his corporate and politically corrupt cronies, and their evil political machine).\n\nMr. Smith on the other hand, is much more representative of the people and ideals of the Democratic party. A giving person who cares about people and a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, and not corporate or other narrow minded interests who utilize dishonesty and playing on humanity's worst instincts, like fear and hatred, to win elections.\n\nIt also is currently applicable to the filibuster debate in the Senate. This movie shows how political appointees (in this case Senators - back in the day), are NOT always good for people or the country as a whole. Jeff Smith was chosen to be (although he balked) a surefire yes-man, and his senior counterpart was a corrupt tool of the corporate controlled political machine of Taylor.\n\nToday George W. Bush wants to appoint a few judges who have clear track records of supporting certain greedy, polluting, irresponsible, corporations over everyday average Americans, or who place their religious beliefs and views over the Constitution and it's protection of every American's rights, liberties, and freedoms.\n\nHence the necessity, in such extreme cases, of using the filibuster. While not as dramatic as Mr. Smith's filibuster, is certainly as useful for the common good of every American, to prevent the worst of the worst and the most extreme of the extreme, legislation or political appointees, from being foisted upon us."

This tale of the idealistic American everyman struggling and triumphing against the greed and corruption that has tarnished the institutions of our country is done in a way that only Capra could pull off. This is perhaps his greatest achievement, with competition only from IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. The acting is superb, with Jimmy Stewart giving an absolutely mesmerising (and frequently hilarious!) performance, and Jean Arthur making the role of the cynical secretary Saunders truly memorable, and reminding us that she's one of the most under-appreciated actresses of all time. The two of them have great chemistry together, and the balance between comedy and drama is perfect. For me, what makes this film truly remarkable is that it is profoundly patriotic without resulting to the flag waving, \"no questions asked\" attitude taken by many people today. The movie expresses a real love for the country, but is not afraid of showing the flaws in the government, though admittedly the resolution IS unrealistic, but that just adds to its charm as a political fantasy. After all, who secretly doesn't wait for a Jeff Smith to come around and win us the America we wish we had? Definitely a 10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "No film is a greater champion of democracy than \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.\" One would be hard pressed to find a film that better communicates the ideals upon which America and democracy were founded. Forget all the patriotic war films or political biopics, \"Mr. Smith\" is the most American film of all time because it reminds us what it means to have a government for the people, by the people.\n\nWhat's most impressive about what is arguably '30s and '40s master Frank Capra's greatest cinematic achievement is that despite not identifying the state Senator Jefferson Smith (Stewart) represents or identifying any political parties, the film is still able to make a profound statement about the complacency among politicians for corruption within government. No one is implicated in this film and no political bias could possibly sway a viewer's opinion -- it's one hundred percent about how in a democracy, people must stand up to their government, opinions and beliefs aside.\n\n\"Mr. Smith\" does it by creating a protagonist in Jeff Smith that represents the typical youthful, idealistic American. When a senator dies, the governor of his state feels caught between the people's choice for a replacement and that of an influential businessman named Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold). He decides to appear as if he isn't favoring either influence by appointing Smith, a boy scout leader -- a choice that shocks everyone. At the very least, the governor figures Smith will be so overwhelmed by Washington that he'll stay quiet in the Senate and allow Taylor's hush-hush controversial dam to be passed.\n\nSmith arrives in Washington and is awe-struck by the monuments and the buildings, not unlike a young American seeing D.C for the first time. All he's known his whole life are the ideals America stands for, not the inner-workings of the political system. We are in his same shoes and much like the film corrupts this idealism for Smith, it corrupts it for us. Stewart, who officially breaks out in this role, is perfect. He has charm, but he's rather nervous and clueless. He is phenomenal at being nervous and uncertain despite speaking with strong conviction -- he's easy to relate to as he fights for what he believes in as the film progresses.\n\nSmiths' emotions are our emotions through the film and that's where \"Mr. Smith\" draws its true power as a film. Between Capra's work building up Washington and then exposing it and Stewart's ability to demonstrate this same idea through his reactions to it, we want to give up when Smith wants to give up. We're even surprisingly convinced ourselves by Jean Arthur's -- who plays Smith's assistant -- passionate speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, pleading Smith to keep fighting. As he continues the fight, we support him, pity him and much more. It's his fire to keep the purity of American ideals that is truly inspiring.\n\nEssentially, Smith is any one of us, a well-respected American, who happens to find his way into a role where he can make a difference, and he single-handedly tries to do what every American wishes he or she could: stand up for what he believes in and never give up, no matter the cost, because it's what's right. There have been films about people making a difference or fighting for the American way, but never one that acts as such a strong metaphor or even a microcosm of when democracy is its most powerful."

It's refreshing to see a movie that expresses ideals. Things were simpler then, ( the film is older than I am!). There is a minimum of sfx. There is, however, a great deal in the way of depth of feeling. Besides the leads, Jas. Stewart and Jean Arthur, the supporting cast is stellar. All roles are very well-cast. The characters are extremely well-defined. The script is so well crafted that it takes us on a rollicking comedic romp, sets us up,and then drops the hammer on the substance of the story. This film will never be surpassed as a perfect example of what great cinema can and should be... at least some of the time. Viva Frank Capra!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Director Frank Capra is maybe the greatest patriot in American film. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington shows plainly that he cares about national values and that he wants to help consolidate the communitarian spirit.\n\nFor Frank Capra parliamentary democracy, enacted in a monument-studded capital, is a cornerstone of the structure of American values. For him it is, as this movie plainly shows, a matter of the heart. In my opinion, that is bad. Parliamentary democracy spells COMPROMISE. It is a matter of reason. Or else it would not work. That's what is wrong with this movie, it muddles the issue in a dangerous way.\n\nThe protagonists are a young inexperienced Senator (James Stewart) and the big meddler and, so to speak, unofficial King of the Senator's state (Edward Arnold). The King has a pet project, a dam which - if I got that right - he wants to have financed by the Federal Government and from which he will eventually earn a huge profit. If others, not least the population of the concerned state, will also profit in one way or the other from the dam, does not interest anybody. Least the Senator. Because he has his own pet project, a camp for Boy Scouts which he envisions - what a coincidence! - on the very spot on which the aforementioned dam is planned. No wonder he is dead set against it.\n\nSo, is it all about that goddamn dam? I'm afraid it is. For the sake of the two pet projects the legislative process of a whole nation is brought to a complete standstill while the Senator is filibustering - apparently the greatest achievement of American parliamentary democracy. Not the best propaganda for the system, if you think about it. It is hard not to see this as the Senator's selfish fight for an isolated issue, with an absolute disregard for the general whole. That his fight leads to a veritable and truly uncanny \u0084children's crusade\" is frightening, not rousing.\n\nI know, I am probably too harsh on this movie. After all, it is only a movie, and its intentions are unquestionably good. James Stewart is at his stumbling cutest, and Jean Arthur, a truly wonderful actress who holds a special place in my heart, is at moments beautiful beyond belief. But it really worries me that messages which should be addressed to man's intelligence are reduced to an emotional impact."

This film released in 1939 has young James Stewart at his very best. It is a political drama/ comedy with elements of patriotism and the usual good vs evil plot. The film has a crowd pleasing element only matched by few.\n\nJeff Smith (James Stewart) believes that children are the future and they should take the values from their great Country. When a senator dies in his state, the governor is forced into an awkward position of electing him the new senator. When Mr. Smith- the true patriot, arrives Washington, he is amazed by all the greatness that Washington possesses. He comes up with idea to propose a Bill that would let kids come together and enjoy the wilderness in a plot in his home town. His colleague Mr. Pain has his own plans with that same land. The film then releases the full fury of what corrupt politicians can do to a truthful man. The U.S. Senate is amazingly detailed. It's also a nice lesson in how the Senate works, how bills have to go through committees, the rules of behavior and filibustering. A heart warming patriotic film from a very rare and different angle."

Presitigious company, indeed! Lewis R. Foster won an Oscar for his story, Capra was nominated for best Director, losing to Victor Fleming for Gone With the Wind, and he lost Best Picture to David O. Selznick for the same film.\n\nTwo supporting actors, who gave marvelous performances in this film also got Oscar nominations: Claude Rains as Sen. Joseph Harrison Paine and Harry Carey as President of the Senate. Who could forget that smile during the filibuster.\n\nOne of the greatest films ever made in Hollywood. A real David vs. Goliath story that will warm your heart and get your blood pumping. This is a classic from the day when movies stood on the strength of the actors and the script, and not on CGI, sex, or violence."

        "review_detailed_main": "Mr Smith Goes to Washington is about country boy Jefferson Smith (Jimmy Stewart) who is appointed (not elected) as a senator for Missouri when the incumbent dies in office.\n\nSmith has been appointed because he is regarded as the perfect patsy, he knows little and is likely to do what he is told. Senator Joseph Paine (Claude Rains) the senior senator from Missouri, Governor Hubert Hopper who has appointed him and a shady man called Jim Taylor plan to build a dam in the State and think with Smith on board this will sail through especially as Taylor is a fixer with plenty of politicians in his pocket.\n\nAs Jefferson knows nothing about the machinations of politicians he arrives in Washington as a greenhorn. He is provided with a cynical secretary Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur) to school him on the politics of the capital. Smith admires Paine as an honourable politician who was revered by Jefferson's own father.\n\nAfter some embarrassing mishaps Jefferson plans to build a boy scout camp at the exact same place as where the dam is supposed to go and before long he is mired down in allegations of corruption and pressured to resign.\n\nWith Clarissa on his side Smith embarks on a long filibuster to save his political life.\n\nIt is nice to know we have always had political corruption and this film tells us that crooked politicians and political fixers were there eighty years and more ago which still gives the movie political relevancy. I just really did not buy it as a political satire. I think Smith was just too weak and naive although I liked all the cynics surrounding him.\n\nThe filibuster scene although nicely performed by Stewart becomes overblown and the whole film borders on being rather schmaltzy which was a constant criticism of director Frank Capra."

        "review_detailed_main": "Another Frank Capra masterpiece surfaces to the pinnacle of movie making!! \"Mr Smith Goes to Washington\" is a film which introduces the American public to the pejorative intricacies of the political process!! Jimmy Stewart's performance in this movie is considered one of the best acting performances ever in the history of the American silver screen!! Back in 1939, even with the Great Depression, Americans conceptualized politicians as icons of altruism who epitomized moral and socially ideological beliefs that people in this country could adhere to!! By attrition, more and more Americans have accepted the fact that politicians are the masters of one precarious preoccupation..it is called graft!! The complacency of pork barreling was something that the political spectrum wanted to keep covert... Here is where the very wet behind the ears Mr Smith (Jimmy Stewart) becomes astounded by the ulterior motives of the actual Washington DC, and not the one which he revered all his young adult life!! The film \"Mr Smith Goes to Washington\" makes filibustering a form of heroics, and translates the desires of the American people to the dogged tenacity of Jimmy Stewart to overcome graft!! Such a resilient assertion of democracy garnered an auspicious reaction from the American moviegoer!! \"Mr Smith Goes To Washington\" has become a legend in the movie world!! Such a charisma is largely due in part to the acting, and the directing in this movie!! At the same time, this film's strongest feature is the overall premise that graft can be overcome by a freshman senator, this powerful element to this movie ultimately cultivated a camaraderie with the American people!! If you have never seen this film before, I strongly recommend that you do!! When the phenomena of the White House and stars and stripes forever become relegated to a citadel of disillusionment, it takes the vigor of a magnanimous maverick politician like Mr Smith (Jimmy Stewart) to set things right!! Jimmy Stewart has always been the Mr squeaky clean baseball, apple pie, and mom type anyway!! He is perfectly cast for this movie!! Frank Capra, who has a virtual myriad of accolades in the world of Hollywood, does a tremendous job at directing this movie!! All in all, I think that \"Mr Smith Goes to Washington\" is a definite American movie legend!!"

James Stewart will take you back to your younger days vibrant with energy, living the ideals and free from bitterness. The romance is the (not oft explored) simpleton-guy & cynic-girl kind. The scene where Stewart prepares the bill with Jean Arthur is priceless. I rate its direction alongside Casablanca and The Apartment, unfortunately its an extinct style. The dialog writing is sublime especially while addressing the themes of liberty and life.\n\nIn hindsight this is one of the earliest superhero movies. There is a hero whom kids adore, bad men with anti-superpowers and a sad girl who is first enthralled by the hero's superpowers but then falls in love with his human side !!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Through a series of fortunate, and unfortunate, events, an unsophisticated local hero, Jefferson Smith, is appointed a US Senator. The people pulling the strings in his party and State figure that he will be compliant and malleable and basically stay out of the way of their plans, some of which aren't entirely ethical, or legal. However, a well-intentioned deed sets off a dramatic chain of events, a series of events that will see him at odds with his colleagues, with the shadowy, bullying powerbrokers and with the entire Senate.\n\nBrilliant movie from Frank Capra. While Capra also gave us such great movies as It's A Wonderful Life, Meet John Doe and It Happened One Night, this is his greatest work. A superb indictment of politics and how democracy has been undermined and corrupted, told with the trademark Capra brand of wholesomeness and practical idealism. Considering how politics has even further degenerated since 1939, even more relevant today than when it was released in 1939.\n\nClever, engaging plot that doesn't waiver for a second. Not an ounce of deadwood in the movie - every scene is perfect and important. Some great twists and turns and some great tension towards the end as Smith struggles to preserve his name and ideals. Wonderful themes and morals too, as you would expect from Frank Capra.\n\nAdd in some excellent performances, especially from James Stewart in the lead role and Jean Arthur as Ms Saunders. Both received Oscar nominations, as did Harry Carey for playing the President of the Senate.\n\nIn all, Mr Smith Goes To Washington was nominated for 11 Oscars, including Best Picture, but won only one, for best original screenplay. Unfortunately for it, the 1940 Oscars belonged to a juggernaut known as Gone With The Wind..."

Freedom not just from gun- wielding despots but freedom from those dictators whose weapons are money and the printed word.\n\nBravo to Mr. Stewart for the performance of a lifetime.

It isn't until he wants to get something done that he is met with those who preferred the status quo way of doing things. Smith isn't bought by anybody like the others and he won't sell out as well. The cast is first rate. Jean Arthur is brilliant in this Capra classic. The supporting cast included the Hollywood greats like Claude Rains, Edward Arnold, Beulah Bondi, Ruth Donnelly, and others. You will root for Jimmy Stewart's Smith because you want too. His performance brings you to him."

The political machine headed by evil Jim Taylor(played by Edward Arnold) thinks that simple Smith will be easy to control, and not stir controversy because he isn't a crony. He is befriended by veteran Senator Joseph Paine(played by Claude Rains) who has been gradually corrupted and cowed by the rotten political bosses. When Smith proves to be his own man, who can't be corrupted or bribed, Taylor uses Paine to concoct a phony scandal related to a bill Jefferson was trying to get passed, leading to a filibuster at his senate hearing...Jean Arthur plays his ally won over by his sincerity.\n\nOutstanding film is even better today, with an intelligent and insightful script about political corruption and the destruction of anyone who dares to stand up to the political machine(partisanship) that rules it is sadly still relevant today. Jimmy Stewart is excellent, and was deserving of an Academy Award(he didn't win) for his entirely believable and impassioned performance. Script pulls no punches either, with a particularly shocking scene of youngsters trying to spread the truth about Mr. Smith being run off the road or beaten up by thugs! Stirring ending may be wish-fulfillment to an extent, but I for one wouldn't have wanted it to end any other way!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Undoubtedly one of the most beloved American films of all time, Frank Capra's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is one of the great directors most cynical portraits of the U.S., revealing an infestation of corruption all the way to the top of the Senate in the city where the Capitol Dome and the Lincoln Memorial sit uneasily as symbols of idealism. The film is also one of his most optimistic, and this blend of attitudes have led to many other Hollywood movies being labelled in his honour as 'Capraesque', one of the most misunderstood and overused labels in cinema.\n\n'Capraesque' is commonly lumped upon movies with an overbearing sense of positivity, with the little man, or woman, ultimately overcoming overwhelming odds to triumph over whatever conglomerate or institution trying to stamp all over them. But what the labellers forget is the skill required to convincingly build up the struggle of the hero, making the climax all the more poignant and satisfying in the process. When Jefferson Smith (James Stewart), the small-town head of the Boy Rangers, is invited to join the U.S. Senate, he accepts the role with humility and a determination to prove himself worthy. What he doesn't know is that fellow senator Joseph Paine (Claude Rains) intends for Smith to be a stooge while he and his boss Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold) go about their dodgy business.\n\nInitially, his \"aw, shucks!\" persona is met with ridicule by the press, and is seen as a naive idiot by his secretary Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur). However, his patriotism soon endears him to Saunders, who witnesses his peers and superiors begin to tear him to shreds as he uncovers a scheme to buy up land. As Smith, Stewart is perfect, embodying the kind of American ideals that the country prides itself upon but rarely follows, stubbornly holding court while he fights for his reputation in a riveting climax. It's a Wonderful Life (1946) is commonly labelled as Capra's finest moment but, in my humble opinion, Mr. Smith is his crowning achievement, a movie of such substance and social insight that it more than transcends its now-routine formula and reaffirms a belief in good overcoming evil."

He is a naive and idealistic and he wants to change everything starting from the building of a camp for children but his plans promptly collide with political corruption and there the true fight starts.\n\nI liked this movie because unfortunately shows us the truth that we all know but never want to believe or talk about it, political corruption and how this influence all of us and our lives. Also this movie also shows us the corruption of th press which is just a small part in the whole political corruption and has as a result the influence of people with lies in order for the companies or politicians to have bigger profit. I really liked the plot of this movie because it represents and shows all of the above. The interpretation of James Stewart who played as Jefferson Smith was simply outstanding and also good interpretation made by Jean Arthur who played as Saunders. Another one interpretation that has to be mentioned is Claude Rains who played as Senator Joseph Paine.\n\nFinally I have to say that \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" shows the truth about most of the politicians in many countries of the world who just want to earn more and more money. They do not care about anything else except that and have help from the press and media to succeed their goals. Although this movie also shows us also the other part of it, a decent man who believes in something that everyone forgot and fights for his believes until the end and never surrender, that's the true meaning of this movie and this we have to have as an example for our lives. So as you can understand I strongly recommend this movie to everyone."

No matter the political ideas or patriotic ones all this film really has is a fish out of water quality that irritates more than it makes fun of the character of Smith. As a drama it isn't dramatic, as a comedy it isn't funny, as social commentary it has an adolescent point of view that isn't na\u00efve, it is ignorant. I could not care about the character because he doesn't really do anything other than pose as something, because he doesn't have the content of his patriotism only the fa\u00e7ade. The Jean Arthur character is the only one with any depth to her convictions and in the end, she must be a convert to the irrelevancies perpetrated by Smith. I am too old to re-watch films I have seen in the past, so I won't be seeing this one again. On the flip side, I still have nothing but affection for Lost Horizons and It Happened One Night, but as I said, for me this film was always a waste of my efforts."

        "review_detailed_main": "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington Thoughts Hey, you all. I just saw Mr. Smith goes to Washington and I have some thoughts. Don't consider this to be a proper review. It's not. I don't even think I should assign a rating to this or any other classic film. Not to say I couldn't. But it's moot. The point of star ratings and the like is to convince people whether or not they should see a film. But any film that has stood the test of time, like this one has, deserves to be watched regardless of what anyone like me thinks of it. With that out of the way, let me say a hundred words' worth about the film.\n\nIf you are looking for artistry in film, this is not the movie you're looking for. There are some nice scenes, particularly those with the American flag and the Lincoln Monument and the like. But that's not the purpose of the film. It wants to win you over with its message more than anything.\n\nShould you watch this film is you are not American? Hm... Well let me think... would I watch a film like this about Sweden or France or what may you? Yes, I would. But I'm a film and history buff. Watch it if you feel like being submerged in a pure, passionate representation of Americana.\n\nThis is the best Capra film. If you haven't watched a one of his movies before, this one is a good place to start. And you should watch at least some of his films; he may not be as 'good' as a lot of other directors, but he nonetheless shaped a good portion of American cinema. If I were teaching a history class on the first five decades of film, he would be one of the names I would make sure everyone knew. Fair warning though: if you are watching one of his movies for the first time, you may be thrown off-guard by his optimism. Even this, one of the more pessimistic ones, has all the tropes one may expect.\n\nI think I enjoyed this movie more now than I would have a few years ago. There just seems to be so much more cynicism in the air now. Maybe it's the world. Maybe it's the part of it I live in. Maybe it's just me. But the end result is that I felt relieved by the film. It was like a breath of fresh air. A dizzyingly saccharine breath of fresh air. Optimism is more appreciated when it is rare.\n\nThat is not the only way the film is better appreciated today. Congress has never been liked. Look at their approval rating throughout history. But nowadays, they are despised with a fervor like nothing else. I'm sure you've hear the joke that the only thing Republicans and Democrats agree on is the worthlessness of contemporary Congress. Of course, the Congress portrayed in the film isn't entirely accurate. You see the exaggerations needed to make it work as satire. But there is a lot of truth in the film. It is an early (and very good example) of what we know call dramedies.\n\nThis film may not change your life. It didn't change mine. But it certainly a film that has moved at least one person. Probably a lot more. And if you cannot pick out at least one moment from the film that moved you, then you are either cold or too politically radical. This is a film that deserves to be watched.\n\n(The Boy Scout Printing scene still made me laugh, though)"

Jimmy Stewart's innocence and idealism are not portrayed as something unusual or freakish for us to stare at, but as the natural condition of every American not warped and twisted by greed and love of power. In that sense, the hero is entirely at home in the movie, though an outsider in Washington; we feel that through Jefferson Smith, we are experiencing the real America. Stewart is wonderful from starry-eyed beginning to exhausted, verge-of-a-breakdown end; he is a hero we can whole-heartedly cheer for. Claude Rains is superb as the fallen \"silver knight\" Joe Paine; it is clear throughout that we are looking at the ruins of a great man, and we share his humiliation when we see him in the degrading company of the triumphant press tycoon. Though the ending has been faulted for being too sudden, I find it very powerful.\n\nAlthough I am not an American, I always get choked up during the famous montage section of patriotic historical landmarks that Smith visits on his first day in Washington. The nobility of the images combined with the stirring music produces a very moving experience. This is a wonderful movie, and despite its period enthusiasm, it is not at all sentimental, if one employs the definition of sentimentality as \"loving something more than God does\". I believe its enthusiasm and zeal are on the side of things like truth, honesty, and goodwill - things that everyone, including God, would join in loving."

He falls head over heals with Senator Paine's daughter Susan (Astrid Allwyn). Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur) is the dead senator's secretary. She has lost her idealism and faith in the system. Smith proposes a national boys camp. Saunders starts to believe. Donations pour in but the campsite turns out to be part of the dam project and threaten the political graft scheme.\n\nThere is such overwhelming sincerity from Frank Capra that any cynicism is driven out. That's the beauty of this movie. It taps into the quintessential little guy against the big guys. Stewart is utterly believable as the completely naive common man. Arthur is a great broad with a heart of gold. The start is a bit of a chore until James Stewart and then Jean Arthur get on the screen.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" (1939) is an unforgettable classic political drama directed by Frank Capra. It follows the story of Jefferson Smith, played by James Stewart, a naive and idealistic young man who is appointed to the U. S. Senate. The movie explores themes of corruption, political manipulation, honesty, dedication, and the power of integrity. Stewart does an outstanding job in the lead, capturing the audience's sympathy and admiration. The supporting cast, including Jean Arthur and Claude Rains, also give stellar performances. An inspiring film that highlights the importance of standing up for what is right, even in the face of overwhelming opposition. Timeless and still relevant today, with a truly memorable conclusion."

Miss Arthur was Capra's favorite leading lady and one wishes thy continued their working relationship. Miss Arthur-the star with that great voice* turned down It's A Wonderful Life, and Apple Annie in Pocketfull of Miracles (Bette Davis got the part)\n\nJames Stewart gives one of the great movie performances and this film rocked America and the world.\n\nPeople talk about Harry Cohn CEO of Columbia but the movies Columbia made under his stewardship: Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, Los Horizon, The Moore The Merrier, Gilda, Born Yesterday, Picnic, The Bridge on the River Kwai etc were classic movies with great stars such as Kim Novak, William Holden, Rita Hayworth, James Stewart, Jack Lemmon, Judy Holiday, Jean Arthur, etc.\n\nJean Arthur was a big star at Columbia working with Capra, Wilder, Hawks and Stevens. Ms. Arthru worked with Gary Cooper, Cary Grant, Rita Hayworth, John Wayne, Marlene Dietrich and and Ronald Colman. I loved her work with Joel MCrea in The More The Merrier.\n\nRead John Oller's fine book on Jean Arthur.: The Actress Nobody Knew\n\nShe was so sexy in The More The Merrier!"

A million words have been written about this wonderful hard-hitting if somewhat simplified satire on corruption yet ultimately optimistic film which I don't need to add to.\n\n....but I will.\n\nIt's the film which made Jimmy Stewart a superstar.\n\nIt's the film which (with the exception of GONE WITH THE WIND) more people saw and made more money than any other film in the whole decade.\n\nIt's the film which will bring tears to your eyes when you hear Lincoln's address spoken - even though you might not even be American!\n\nIt's the film which might even make you proud to be an American - again even if you're not American and the only time you visited there you thought it was noisy a bit dirty and the bacon wasn't right.\n\nIt's the film with Guy Kibbee in it where he's not called Pop.\n\nIt's the film you can watch over and over again because each time you do it gets even better.\n\nIf however you're someone who might use the expression: 'sickly over sentimental nonsense where all the rich people and all politicians are stereotypically nasty, the press are 100% evil cynical life destroying monsters but the good ole' boy from the back woods is the only man in Washington with a kind and pure heart' then maybe this film isn't for you. But then again, if you are a cynical pessimistic misery-guts, possibly even a journalist - between eating babies, maybe after watching this, you'll be leaping around the park like Mr Banks singing: Let's Go Fly a Kite! I'm actually only half-joking: this really is one of those pictures which after you've watched it seriously makes you feel better and makes you want to be better! Basically, If you liked PADDINGTON, you'll like this.\n\nWhilst it's utterly enthralling, the actual story is completely stupid - really stupid: He wouldn't get elected in the first place.\n\nWhy couldn't he build his boy scout camp on the other side of the river?\n\nWhat's that proposal got to do with the US Senate anyway?\n\nHow did all those newspapers get printed and protest marches happen during just those first few hours?\n\nHow could he speak for 24 hours without going to the toilet!\n\nThe magic of this film is that none of that matters. Whilst you're watching this you're transported to another world, a magical world where you believe anything and everything. Maybe you believe that world is real because you want to believe it's real - because you want to believe in a world which can be made better just by being a better person?\n\nIt's all the more remarkable because this wasn't originally a Frank Capra film. It was nearly a Rouben Mamoulian picture (which might also have been brilliant) so Mr Capra inherited the project from someone else along with a story not written by his usual partner, Robert Riskin. (It's by Lewis Foster - who?) So what we have here is Capra on his own - maybe a little less humorous, maybe the little subtle in showing the little guy against the big guy theme but Capra's almost unique skill in making his protagonist's challenges and struggles your challenges and struggles - and always, ultimately your victory too is never better exhibited than in this."

The strong storyline in this film made me upset to watch because the message is still relevant 80 years later. For the year it was produced, it is an extremely sound film from a visual and sound perspective, and I like it.\n\nDirector Frank Capra did an amazing job with timing and pacing in this film. Anyone who can captivate an audience during a filibuster is a wizard and he proved it in this film. It is hard to identify with the acting because I am not from that era, but one thing I did notice was there wasn't as much of the traditional over acting common with that time. These are the type of performances I would have love to see in all the old films. I believe this level of acting may have drastically changed my opinion of older movies. This film is a must see especially for anyone who truly believes politics is a completely honest profession."

I found it a good movie, a very powerful one, but yet one I have not watched again, for some reason. I guess it wasn't that attractive to me to see multiple times.\n\nYet, I can't criticize it. Jimmy Stewart is interesting as always, in the lead as \"Jefferson Smith.\" Jean Arthur is the most fun of all the actors to watch in here and actually her \"Clarissa Saunders\" might be the lead character, not Stewart's. Claude Rains is so good that you want to punch his character, \"Sen. Joseph Paine\" right in the nose!\n\nI will say it's very dated, but some of that corny stuff adds to the enjoyment of the story. Some of it is refreshing, too, like the unashamed overt promotion of solid values, for instance - something Liberal viewers watching this must hate. You don't see that much patriotism or values-first themes in movies anymore.\n\nA good movie, but at 130 minutes a bit long and one that I would advise to rent first instead of purchasing blind because of its high reputation."

Mr. Smith goes to Washington is one of those movies. This movie has all of the red, white, and blue, and anything inbetween that could make all people proud of America. Jefferson Smith a leader in a small town is suddenly put in the position of state senator. He is very naive and this is the only reason he was given the job. Soon he is able to make his own project which with out his knowing goes againsn't the political machine of his state. Smith finds out that one man is running his state and corrupting its politions with money. He fights againsn't it with all of his might and with the constitution keeps the senate floor running for over 24 hours! This movie of Frank Capra's is certainly idealistic and perfect for America during the time of war. But today can seem almost cheesy, When Smith goes to Washington he a common tourist times 10. He insists on seeing almost every monument in one day and worries his fellow politions! Now this is a little over board, he should have more priorities than that. Although certainly very American this movie is a little over patriotic and not the best of Frank Capras work. The reunion of Capra and Stewart is wonderful in this movie, Stewart is wonderful playing his role as the naive senator.This choice for Stewart is superb he is a role model for all Americans and enhances the movies morale to the nth degree! Overall I would rate this movie a 7 out of 10."

It was a disaster with a major political backlash on the Hollywood studios in the form of threatened legislation. \"Mr. Smith Goes To Washington\" is a wonderful film which had the nerve to suggest that corruption exists in our own beloved Capitol. Even the powerful Joe Kennedy (Father of JFK) got into the fray - on the side of the government - and demanded that Columbia withdraw the film from distribution.

        "review_detailed_main": "In the golden age of cinema, year 1939, Frank Capra released his political masterpiece \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.\" Starring James Stewart, Jean Arthur, and Claude Rains, it is a film about a naive young \"Boy Ranger\" leader (no doubt meant to be a reference to the Boy Scouts of American) with big dreams about American politics, history, and freedom, who is selected by the governor of his state to replace a deceased senator. Expecting a dream come true, he soon finds that he was only selected to be pawn for the powerful and corrupt \"Taylor Machine\" along with his fellow senator Joseph Paine. Rather than back down and follow orders, he decides to stay true to his ideals and stand up against corrupt politics.\n\nThis film is a landmark in cinema for several reasons. First of all, it was incredibly important too society. It was often frowned upon at the time because it was one of the first films, if not THE first, to paint a somewhat negative picture of American politicians, but it was also banned in several fascist and communist countries because of it's message of democracy, freedom, and the power of one. It was the last American film to be shown in France before the German occupation and no doubt gave hope to the country that freedom was on its way.\n\nIt is also a very inspiring film. Many claim that Frank Capra's work is all very unrealistic and corny. Several claim more specifically that in real life this film would not have ended the way it would. I disagree with that, but even so, there's not denying that this film is powerful. By the end of it, you feel very uplifted. It makes you believe in the power of your voice, the power of one man, and the importance of having high ideals.\n\nIt is also just overall an incredibly well-done film. Some of the transitions are very quick, but that just the time period, filmmakers at that time had yet to experiment with flashy camera work and creative transitions and such. Most definitely what was important about films in the 30's and 40's was the content much less than the camera work or the editing, and the content is fantastic. The film has an excellent screenplay, and lovable characters as well as some detestable ones. It's also very informative, containing somewhat of a lesson on the way the legislative system of our government works. but what stands high above everything else in this film is most definitely the acting.\n\nJames Stewart is absolutely brilliant as the young and naive, yet determined Jefferson Smith. When he gets to Washington he has every appearance of a little boy going to see his favorite baseball team play for the first time. In the first part of the film he's very passive and very vulnerable, but also very kind, but once he starts to stand up for himself, he exudes power with his performance, and you can see the transition completely.\n\nJean Arthur is adorable as the cynical yet sweet Saunders, and while the romance between her and Smith is a little underplayed, it's very captivating. Claude Raines also give a brilliant performance as Senator Joseph Paine. You can see the inner struggle of his character in his expressions and his delivery is impeccable. And Harry Carry's reactions as the President of the Senate are priceless. They're subtle but very amusing.\n\nAll in all this is a movie that true film buffs absolutely should not miss, as well as anyone who is interested in politics or would like a good lesson in acting."

He played with a rare naive and innocence that set the role on a whole high. It is easily a charming and lovely performance by him. Indeed, there is nothing charming about the character coz its neither stylish nor flamboyant, but its supremely honest and that is what is charming about Senator Smith.\n\nThis film is certainly one of the finest Capra's film and probably next only to his It's a Wonderful Life. It tells the story of how an upright straightforward juvenile boy is trapped in the conundrums of corruption that is there in 1930s America. And how he fights to overcome that.\n\nNow this is a simple line that is made extravagant by imbibing many political details in the realms of the script. From elaborating the meaning of Liberty to referring many clauses of USA constitution, this film is wonderfully insightful and politically detailed.\n\nThe dare of the director to take on a corrupt and flawed state of the political system in America is worth appreciating. This indeed stands out as a very first and prominent film to take on the role of nexus between politicians and local business people.\n\nEvery technical department from light to sound to writing is perfect. Above all, I loved the writing by Rob Riskin and Frank Capra. This is a fine film and has many great moments. Thanks to Capra for this and admiration for his work grows. A 4/5 for this."

For the life of me, I can't find the part of the Constitution that empowers the federal government to loan money to build a boys' camp.\n\nCall me a crazed reactionary, but I'm far more concerned about assaults on the fabric of the Constitution--even seemingly minor ones--than I am about ordinary human turpitude."

        "review_title": "An essential political comedy drama",
        "review_detailed_main": "Produced and directed by Frank Capra, with a story by Lewis R. Foster and a screenplay by Sidney Buchman, this essential political comedy drama features James Stewart in the title role, as Jefferson Smith (AFI's #11 hero), who's appointed to the Senate by his state's Governor Hubert 'Happy' Hopper (Guy Kibbee), on the advice of his children (the Watson brothers), when one of their Senators dies. The state's senior Senator Joseph Harrison Paine is played by Claude Rains.\n\nStewart's character is a young, idealistic boys' club (like the Boy Scouts) leader and a patriot, who's far too naive to fair very well among the alligators in Washington, D.C.. This fact is quickly recognized by everyone, especially the former Senator's streetwise secretary Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur), who helps Smith navigate the treacherous waters of our nation's capital (and capitol building) and eventually (and obviously) falls in love with him.\n\nEdward Arnold plays media magnate Jim Taylor, who controls the state's political party and \"owns\" several (if not all) of its politicians. At the time of Smith's appointment, Taylor is in the midst of having his civil servants put through some pork barrel legislation (a dam project) for his own financial real estate benefit. Once the junior Senator catches wind of what's going on, Taylor utilizes Paine et al against Smith, who famously incorporates a one man filibuster, in a symbolic fight against the other politicians' corruption.\n\nThomas Mitchell, Eugene Palette, Beulah Bondi as Ma Smith, H.B. Warner as the Senate Majority Leader, Harry Carey as the Vice President, Grant Mitchell and Porter Hall as senators, Charles Lane as a newsman named Nosey, William Demarest, and Dick Elliott are among those also in the cast.\n\nCapra earned two Academy Award nominations, Best Picture and Best Director; Foster won the film's only statuette for his original story, and Buchman's screenplay was Oscar nominated. Stewart received his first Best Actor nomination; supporting actors Rains (his first) and Carey (his only) were also nominated, as was Lionel Banks' Art Direction, Dimitri Tiomkin's Score, John Livadary's Sound, and its Editing (Gene Havlick's last nomination, Al Clark's second). The film was added to the National Film Registry in 1989. #29 on AFI's 100 Greatest Movies list. #5 on AFI's 100 Most Inspiring Movies list."

        "review_detailed_main": "This 1939 movie had the lovable, emotive Jimmy Stewart playing a regular guy turned Senator who decides to make moral behavior a top priority. Unfortunately, the writer/director sabotaged the Smith's character development early on by having him go on a rampage, punching at least 3 reporters to the ground. Physical violence and assault between adults and even between an adult and a boy(It's a Wonderful Life: 1947) must have been seen as socially acceptable during this period. If so, the Trump era, where violence is either encouraged or condoned at political rallies, is merely a throw back to a previous era, not so long ago. Physical violence and attacks are a seen as a sign of strength, exactly as Frank Capra depicted in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. This movie certainly deserves an explanatory warning for younger generations."

I'm shocked Smith is capable of breathing automatically. As the endless embarrassing hooey accumulates, the viewer casts sideward glances for a means to escape. Then, in the middle of his filibuster, Smith turns into a neo-Cicero.\n\nHowever, the character is suitable to promote leftist Capra's notion that the government can fix everything if only it was honest. Unfortunately, that idea was as much hogwash in 1939 as it is today.\n\nThere is a grain of truth in the movie, the depiction that control of the media can control public opinion by omission. Media control is now nationwide and by similar acts of omission. This is the only reason I can rate this movie a 5, out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\n\nWith the death of a senator in the opening scene, the puppet masters of the government look for a new yes man to fill the dead senator's shoes. They find Jeff Smith, a son of liberty, a mentor to young boys. They expect Jeff to roll over and die for them, they expect him to do as they say. But what they don't expect is for Mr. Smith's honor and ideals to overcome all odds. Jimmy Stewart oozes with charisma in his role as Jeff Smith, the small town guy with big ideals. Jimmy makes the role lovable and he drips with a realism that would make Stanislovsky proud. He also delivers all his lines with sincerity that envelops the audience into this heroic battle that Mr. Smith is catapulted into. But every lead actor is only as strong as the actors supporting him. The supporting actors in this film each brought a multitude of talents to the screen. They played their parts with an unmatched professionalism that made `Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' a joy to watch. The performances were in every way inspiring and memorable. Feeding the actors brilliance was the writing in Mr. Smith. The story was both original and entertaining. The story line starts with a medium pace, it then slows a bit in the middle so it can slip in some essential patriotism, then the end steeply climbs up to the satisfying and enthralling conclusion of the story. To show off the fantastic writing the director (Frank Capra) uses double exposure (a cutting edge editing technique at the time) and he also includes shots of monuments in Washington, D.C. that are exalting to the spirit. And even though Capra's directing is anything but subtle, in this case, it was appropriate for him to drive the point home. The major themes are patriotism and perseverance, which evoke emotion in anyone with a soul. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington was and is an American classic. And American classics don't deserve to collect dust. I loved this movie because I was lost in the beautiful story. After the triumphant climax I snapped back to reality and found that I had actually been praying that Jeff would find vindication. This film, this masterpiece is worthy of being bathed in compliments and of being watched by all."

        "review_detailed_main": "Capra is often criticized for making his films too \"mushy\" and overly dramatic, taunted with phrases like \"Capra-corn.\" Perhaps this is true for some of his lesser films, but even the most stoic of critics has a soft spot for Capra's 1939 film, Mr Smith goes to Washington.\n\nStewart gives a commanding performance as the title character who epitomizes everything good and pure - he is a scout leader and lives with his mother after all. When elected to Congress, he is awkward and admirable all at once, common for nearly all of Stewart's roles. After being framed by corrupt politicians, Smith acts to stand up against the system and defend what is left of the nation's ideals.\n\nJames Stewart makes this film great. One scene in particular stands out: he describes his home to his assistant Clarissa (played wonderfully by Jean Arthur). Her eyes light up at his vivid, moving descriptions, and yours will too. And who can forget one of Stewart's most famous scenes, the filibuster near the end of the film.\n\nCapra does make the film dramatic, but with purpose and to great success. During this time, the country was in need of patriotism. Capra had always used his films as carriers of messages (as in \"It Happened One Night\"). The message rings true today and the movie will move you... if you let it."

Look at this movie, you will feel the strange impossibility of sitting comfortable in your bed or armchair, you will stand up for the last half an hour of the film believe this if you can. No movie made me fill so alive, so present, so powerful. I'm telling you I'm not easy to impress, I saw lots of movies and I never felt the urge to write such a review.\n\nDo not say, as I could have easily argued and sustain that this is a classical American propaganda movie. Don't destroy the idea of this film by taking it like that. OK, remove the whole American propaganda frame and think of it like there is just a man who will fight a rotten mechanism, who will dedicate his energy to mankind, to his fellows.I still feel I haven't said enough but...there is much to say about justice and politics, there are libraries out there in the whole world. Just see this, it is a simple movie, the simplest you can get, but all so you can better see the essence. The essence is not covered with stuff. All the lights are on this essence I'm telling you about. Have a nice day everybody!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Essentially, this is the same story as MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN, an earlier, better, Capra film. Stewart is good as the altruistic young senator, but not as good as he was in movies like THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, or even ROPE, where his characters have much more meat. Jean Arthur is wonderful, playing the same kind of role she played in DEEDS, but with more maturity and confidence. Claude Rains is terrific as the duplicitous senior senator from the same unnamed state as Smith.\n\nThe movie itself is a good lesson in Washington politics, relevant even now with its cynical mentality about money and corruption. But the story doesn't quite hold up. At some points it's like watching an infomercial for AMERICA! The Constitutional propaganda gets a bit much even for a Capra movie. I loved the filibuster sequence to a point - and then you get to that point and it's over the top. The ending is particularly unsatisfying, especially given Capra's normal emphasis on conclusions.\n\nI don't want to give the impression that I didn't like it, it's an excellent movie. I just wouldn't put it into an elite classic category."

        "review_detailed_main": "I love this movie! James Stewart gives, in my opinion, his finest performance as the naive senator Jefferson Smith, who goes to Washington with the idea that he's going to change the world. He thinks of Washington as the greatest city, and, as a matter of fact, gets lost his first day there. People want to take him to the Senate to show him around, but Jeff wanders over towards the Capitol building and ends up boarding a tour bus. He has a boyish innocence to him that is absolutely charming.\n\nMy favorite part is when Senator Paine, following big man Jim Taylor's orders, brings in baskets of telegrams saying that Jeff should end his filibuster. Jeff looks at them desperately, and hangs his head, thinking that he almost killed his voice for nothing. But then, Jeff looks at the president of the Senate, who has liked the idealistic young man from the beginning. The President gives Jeff a warm smile, and Jeff smiles back. He realizes that he can continue with his filibuster, and do a good job!\n\n\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" is definitely one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. If you're a Capra fan, or a fan of James Stewart, Jean Arthur, Harry Carey, Edward Arnold, or Thomas Mitchell, I really recommend this. Also, Claude Rains gives one of the best performances ever as Senator Paine. So I give this wonderful movie a 10: the highest rating there is!"

While I LOVE \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and try to watch it at least once a year, I cannot understand why this dreadful effort is considered one of Capra's best. Don't waste your time or your money. There are far superior movie directed by Capra out there. And much, MUCH better work by Jimmy Stewart."

        "review_detailed_main": "MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON,' is an overlooked gem of our time. Does the senate really treat rookies or newcomers like they way they did in the film? No one really knows except, for Frank Capra. He manages to show how even a great man can sometimes be condemned for no apparent reason.\n\nIn the beginning, one of the states (no idea which one) has lost one of their senators , and is in a mad scramble looking for a replacement. The governor has selected Jefferson smith (James Stewart) To go serve as a senate member in Washington. But is this a mistake? Does he know what could possibly go wrong? Jefferson knew very little about being on the senate, so this serves as a target for criticism, and ridicule from other senators. The other senate member, of his state is senator Paine, an old friend of his dad's. Payne is going along with smith on his way to Washington, to help him out. (or as though we think.) When Jefferson arrives in Washington, he runs off to go look at the natl. capitol, and other places, leaving senn. Payne and others behind. When Jefferson decides to come back, he is introduced to beautiful young Clarissa Saunders. (Jean Arthur) Through out most of the movie she tries to help him along, but finds that she is getting nowhere with him. At the same time Jefferson is trying to propose a bill to the senate, that will create an all boys camp, on government property. This is where the trouble starts. While Jefferson is trying to figure this out, sen. Payne, tries to round up some people who can help him get Jefferson out of office. The next day, when Jefferson is ready to present his bill, he is in for a rude awakening. He is extremely nervous and scared. When it comes time for him to present his bill, a lot of the senators are extremely rude to him, and won't even let him speak. This ends up happening because sen. Payne and others lied about him and tried to get him into trouble with the law. Jefferson finding out the hard way that everyone, (even his own friend) has let him down disgracefully, decides to go sit and weep by the Lincoln memorial. When who should come along at the right place and time? Miss. Saunders. She convinces him not to give up, but to have faith in what he believes in. She takes him back to his office, and decides to stick with him all the way through, so he can not only defend his bill, but also stomp on those who have committed that foolish act against him. The heat is rising on the floor of the senate house as Jefferson is trying to defend the bill, after hours and hours, of talking he then starts to defend himself against those who hate him. A few hours later while Jefferson is still arguing with other senators, sen. Payne does something remarkable That can\u0091t be discussed without spoiling the movie. Even though Payne did a terrible thing to Jefferson, he made up for it by coming clean and doing the right thing.\n\nYoung good looking James Stewart, and older but not to old Claude Rains, make terrific duo in this film, as not only being friends, but true enemies as well. The film has many values to it, especially on how far a friend will go to help someone out, even if his dishonesty towards his friend is apparent. This film has earned a passing grade from the reviewer. It is not the best thing ever viewed before, but it is worth seeing sometime. Go rent it."

Mr. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON is the affirmation of idealism ordinary \"small\" man, benevolent and noble individuals whose actions can and manages to change the world. Director's style is excellent. Mr. Deeds has already won the audience. Mr. Smith is another part of similar stories and themes. Coincidentally, \"man of the people\" becomes essential. By chance he comes in the opportunity to learn about the disease of society and to a painful, romantic, compelling and always humor bathed in a way defending real human values. Comedy upgraded socio - political ideological segments. American society, like any other is perishable. It is unlikely that this one little man can change. The culmination of this film returns us faith in the true value.\n\nJames Stewart (Jefferson \"Jeff\" Smith) is idealistic and honest man who will soon disappoint the world of high politics. Fantastic performance was launched in the stars. His performance was fantastic.\n\nJean Arthur (Clarissa Saunders) is quiet in search of human warmth. The search for something that would change her monotonous everyday life is at times accompanied by sarcasm. I must admit that I really like her acting. Her experience is growing in the climax of the film. It is again a \"trigger\" of the main character.\n\nThe story is a playful and dynamic, perhaps a little more symbolic. The picture is excellent. The dialogues in the troubles are good. Romance is definitely late, but the intimate moments of the main characters are very well designed. It's a strange feeling. Almost all my works great, and I'm still not satisfied. Certainly this movie will not be called controversial. Honesty, love and kindness in times of corruption."

That Washington is a cesspool is self-evident from reading the daily news; that someone idealistic could expose Washington on such a flimsy basis as a questionable land deal...\n\nAbout the best moment was when Stewart's Secretary explains how a bill is passed; now that sounded true to life.

The political machine of nefarious \"boss\" Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold) is behind Smith because they believe he is gullible and can be made to vote however they want. But when a bill Smith wants to push through for a boys camp comes into conflict with a graft-laden bill Taylor wants pushed through, the young Senator gets a lesson the hard way in Washington politics. Before Smith's knocked out for the count, he gets help from a seasoned political aide (Jean Arthur) who has fallen in love with his goodness and honesty. Together they take on the Taylor machine and Washington's corruptness.\n\nEarnest, sentimental classic from the master of the sentimental, Frank Capra. Stewart gives a tour-de-force performance, particularly in the second half. He's helped ably by Arthur, Arnold, and the venerable Claude Rains as an elder statesman who gave in to corruption long ago. It really is a terrific cast from top to bottom. Worthy of singling out among the support though are Thomas Mitchell and Harry Carey, Sr. Mitchell is great as Arthur's reporter friend. This, of course, would not be the last film he made with Capra and Stewart. Harry Carey almost steals the movie and he's only in it here and there. His total screen time doesn't amount to much but in every scene he's amazing with subtle facial expressions and a knowingness in his performance that comes with experience. This is really a phenomenal film. Patriotic and unabashedly so. They don't make 'em like this anymore. A must-see for everybody and a truly classic film."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is no wonder director Frank Capra has inspired the likes of Oliver Stone, Martin Scorsese and many other filmmakers who depict everyday hypocrisy in some of their work. MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON oozes with patriotism and idealism, with corruption around the borders. Jimmy Stewart does not \"belong\" in Washington, but the incredulous \"Jefferson Smith\" will not accept the limits put on freedom, hence Stewart's greatest performance. This is Capra's most idealistic work, a film he seemed to prepare for the upcoming test the United States would be put to in just two years in World War II. Modern day viewers will no doubt see the dated elements in Capra's presentation of our country's mores. I felt awe and a new sense of patriotism in the montage of images from D.C. that I wish I could still completely believe in. Time has told us we can't. \"Jeff Smith\" would be crushed in today's political climate, but it is a beautiful thing to see this David and Goliath fight take place in the form of a Senatorial filibuster.\n\nCapra's direction is so forward and compelling in showing the once bright-eyed Mr. Smith's realization of what he is up against. Even in the 1930's, there were \"political machines\" led by mobsters or businessmen. Stewart is the best at showing emotion through his facial gestures. His weepy breakdown in he and Capra's equally brilliant ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE is similar to Mr. Smith's 23 hour filibuster. He is everyman and isn't that who we wish was passing and signing bills in this country? Jean Arthur is sweet as \"Saunders\", the hard-nosed, yet sympathetic heroine who helps Smith in his plight. You can see immediately when she falls in love with Smith in a wonderfully filmed scene where Smith promotes his ideals for the youth of America. The classical Hollywood close-up is utilized to show her love through happy tears.\n\nAs in most Capra flicks, the supporting cast is colorful and right to create a slightly comedic and heavily dramatic atmosphere. You can only imagine how the U.S. government viewed this picture back in the day. Capra was a maverick who clearly put country and hope first on his list of artistic priorities. The happenings we see in a film like MR SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON can only happen in Hollywood films, which is why the system and its classics have endured for so long. Here is a movie that they should show in the \"Capital Dome\" on a daily basis to the fatcats who sit in office today. \"Jefferson Smith\" is pure fiction but absolutely possible if only earnestness and honesty were practiced in Washington now. Elements of this great film are all over movies like JFK, ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, or BORN ON THE 4TH OF JULY. To sound overly enthusiastic, take this movie and hold it up in front of you and take in its important message.\n\nRATING: 10 of 10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The death of a senator results in party crisis. As the powerful members pitch their own candidates, the head of the party, at the insistence of his children, selects Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) - a local scout hero. People against this decision are told that Mr. Smith with his boyish charm is a perfect man for the job as he won't ask inconvenient questions and at the same time party will get some middle class support. All hells break loose when Mr. Smith turns out to be a Lincolnian. Mr. Paine, who is the other senator from the state and Jeff's ideal since childhood, slams him with charges of corruption to get rid of him. Jeff is heartbroken with the realities of Washington. He decides to take the next train home but his secretary Saunders (Jean Arthur) who is already jaded with political surroundings helps him fight back.\n\nPerformance-wise James steward is at his best. He is very convincing as a local hero, a Lincolnian youth and frustrated senator. Jean Arthur is good. She did a little over acting but its OK for comic relief. Claude Rains is very good as Mr. Paine. Edward Arnold is too good. Thomas Mitchell is fantastic as Diz Moore. This movie is extremely comical, serious stuff and jokes are happening at the same time.\n\nThe film is extremely tight, entertaining and very well crafted. It was my second Capra film. I wanted to watch this film to checkout the senate footage. It turned out to be a huge lesson on US senate for me. This film actually explains lots of processes i.e. Jean Arthur describes how a bill is passed, oath taking ceremony etc. The first half of the film is establishing and humorous. Second half of the film is extremely definitive and to the point. The last 20 minutes of the film are thrilling. I think its one of the best story, dialogs and screenplay I have seen ever. It's a flawless film. The only other films in the same league are 'Anand', 'Guide' and 'Bicycle thief'. All of them are genius works. 'Advise and Consent (1962)' has the same backdrop but has just too many flaws. I don't have a 'Cinemascope' brain but while watching this film I noticed some scenes which were done in a particular way to narrate the story for e.g. in a sentimental scene Jean Arthur's eyes are in the shadow as tears wont go with her character. I think it's a shame that this film lost all its well deserved Oscars to one of the most overrated and boring film 'Gone with the film'. The only reason it got an Oscar for original Story was probably because there was no competition. I'm sure this movie was sidelined for obvious reasons. It came out in the middle of the world war and America bashing was the last thing Americans wanted."

        "review_title": "A classic performance",
        "review_detailed_main": "James Stewart gives a classic performance as Senator Jefferson Smith in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. It's the type of performance which makes an actor a star and, sure enough, after making this film Stewart was on his way to becoming an American acting icon. But while Stewart's performance is an undeniable timeless classic there is the nagging sense that the film as a whole isn't quite on par with the performance of its leading man. It's a good film but perhaps it falls just a touch short of excellence.\n\nMr. Smith Goes to Washington is another of those uplifting, inspiring stories which director Frank Capra seemed to specialize in. In this case the story revolves around a simple man, Jefferson Smith, thrust into a situation which is anything but simple. Smith's a good, honest, sincere fellow. A typical Capra hero. He is the head of a youth group, the Boy Rangers, and has a real passion for improving the lives of children. And he will take that passion to Washington when, completely out of the blue, he is appointed to the United States Senate to replace a deceased senator. It becomes apparent very quickly that this naive young man, armed only with the best of intentions, is in over his head. But that's part of what makes the character of Jefferson Smith so appealing. His home state's corrupt political machine figures his inexperience will make him easy to control. Boy are they ever in for a surprise.\n\nAs we watch Jefferson Smith make his way in the seamy world of Washington politics it's very easy to embrace the character. But it is at times somewhat less easy to embrace the film. Everyone remembers the famous final scene. It's powerful and inspiring and brilliantly done. In that scene we get to see both a character, Jefferson Smith, and an actor, James Stewart, really come into their own. It's magnificent. But much of what precedes that scene comes across as rather mundane. The story proceeds at a leisurely pace, at times much too leisurely. Too often there just is not much going on to move the story forward. Stewart is terrific and his two main co-stars, Jean Arthur as Smith's initially jaded assistant and Claude Rains as the less than honest senior senator from Smith's state, are very good as well. So the performances aren't the problem. It's the story, which turns out to be a little too simple to really sustain itself for over two hours. And if the story had a little better pace to it perhaps the film wouldn't have in the end been in such a hurry to finish which, after Stewart's big scene, leaves us with an ending which is jarringly abrupt. Losing some scenes in the middle of the film to leave some more time to better wrap things up at the end would have been a good trade-off. But for whatever little disappointments there may be this still is a very good film, one which features one of Hollywood's most classic performances. James Stewart alone would be enough to make this film worth watching. And there are enough good things around him to ultimately make the film very satisfying."

        "review_detailed_main": "Yes, \"Mr. Smith\" is a terrific example of classic Hollywood writing, and one of Capra's best movies, but this film was made to me by Jimmy Stewart. He was that sort dumb man charm that makes you like him right away, to root for him, for his character. And there a lot of actors he can do that. But unlike most of the likable Hollywood stars, Jimmy Stewart is also an amazing actor. Vocal patterns, facial expressions, whatever, Jimmy Stewart can use them to transcend any kind of a powerful, or subtle, emotion . And this performance was the highlight of his career. it defined everything that was great about Jimmy Stewart. Not to mention a great supporting cast featuring Claude Raines.\n\nI would have liked to give the film a higher rating, but as always, Capra's sentimentality got to me. Some of the stuff in the film is so happy it feels fake. Capra is the master of sentimentality, but it is still not the greatest of film styles. This film is still classic. It is best both Capra and Stewart had too offer, and the combination provides mostly joy, though sometimes it can be piled on a little too thick.\n\n7.5/10\n\n* * * 1/2 / * * * *"

        "review_detailed_main": "It's a comedy-drama set in Washington, D. C., and an unnamed midwestern state. It follows the experience of an idealistic young leader of boy scouts (called Boy Rangers) who finds himself appointed to the Senate to fill the term of a deceased senator.\n\nThe leader of the state's political machine, Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold), orders Governor Hubert Hopper (Guy Kibbee) to appoint a compliant person to fill a Senate seat to ensure the passage of a corrupt bill supporting the construction of a dam in Taylor's state. However, Hopper's sons convince him to consider appointing Jefferson Smith (James Stewart), a statewide scout leader, to the post. Unfortunately, the senior senator from the state, Joe Paine (Claude Rains), is part of the graft but is an idol to Smith since Paine and Smith's father had been best friends and fighters for justice in earlier days.\n\nWhen Smith gets to Washington, he is almost overwhelmed by the majesty of it all but receives much help from his initially-cynical assistant, Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur). Diz Moore (Thomas Mitchell), a journalist friend of Saunders, also has a prominent role in helping to get Smith's message out.\n\nWhen Smith proposes a bill to build a camp for the Boy Rangers that happens to be on the dam site, the conflict between Smith and the corrupt political machine rapidly increases and climaxes when Smith filibusters in the Senate to respond to false charges by the Taylor-Paine cabal.\n\nThis film is a pretty dated comedy. Jefferson Smith is naive beyond belief, and at no time does he actually introduce any proof against the political machine. But he's excellent at the \"aw shucks\" demeanor. Jean Arthur strikes all the right notes moving from cynicism to doe-eyed supporter of Smith. It all seems heavy-handed, but it remains significant for its warning about political corruption in the 1930s."

Pitch-perfect movie, despite its lengthy \"showboating\" scene at the end, where everything builds to the only conclusion possible in this kind of movie. I wasn't expecting so much realistic violence at the end...maybe that's a nod to the union busting days. Overall: Many great performances!

        "review_detailed_main": "Politics has, and always will be, the art of compromise. If it wasn't hardly any of the business of the nation would ever get done. Even a boy ranger has to do that every now and then.\n\nCompromise is not a word heard in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Frank Capra's heroes and villains are starkly contrasted in his populist films.\n\nThis film with its powerful performance by James Stewart as Jefferson Smith, interim appointee to the United States Senate from an unnamed western state, is now such a part of Americana that criticism of it is almost sacrilegious. The performance is great, but the premise behind the film needs some examination.\n\nHaving a national boy's camp seems like a fine idea, who could be against it. But having it be at Willett Creek in his state, was that truly necessary? Granted that the proposed dam is piece of pork barrel legislation that a few are going to make a killing on.\n\nQuite realistically the dam is a rider on an appropriations bill that Capra names the \"deficiency bill\" which is a bill for further relief to the citizens of 1939 USA which was still in the Depression. Stewart is by his filibuster, holding up relief for a whole nation.\n\nHere's where compromise comes in. The seasoned politician or even a novice trying to learn would ask himself, just what are my priorities? Isn't getting that boy's camp my goal, how do I achieve that goal? In the end Stewart might get that boy's camp, but I certainly hope if he did stay in the Senate he didn't develop any other goals that halted the nation's business.\n\nGive and take, that's what it's all about folks.\n\nJean Arthur is a fine Capra heroine. Women in Capra films can certainly be independent and have careers, but their main function is to support the hero, especially when he's down. Her best moments in this film and in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town is when the hero seems beaten and all is lost, she provides the spark that gets him up before the bell counts him out.\n\nCapra rounds the cast out with a whole crew of familiar players who you look to as old friends whenever you see one of his films. One of Capra's great attributes was an intuitive sense of casting, just like John Ford. Whenever you see Edward Arnold, Guy Kibbee, Thomas Mitchell, you know immediately the kind of part they will be playing and you welcome them as old friends.\n\nClaude Rains plays the other Senator from Stewart's state, a well respected man who's being talked of for the White House. It's Rains's only Capra film and as always he gives a great performance. He's the mouthpiece of Edward Arnold's political machine in the Senate and has been there a few terms. He's also an old friend of Stewart's late father. It's only an appeal to Rains by Stewart on a personal basis that breaks things open during that famous filibuster scene. Capra had to have that in the story because other than that, Stewart would have been dealt with by his colleagues summarily despite his last stand heroics.\n\nEgo is something that has to be put aside occasionally. I do wonder what happens to Stewart and Arthur in the future because it doesn't look like he's learned that."

We are so naive as a nation when it comes to this kind of stuff. As I write this review, a new law concerning the accepting of gifts just hit the books. But it didn't include add on amendments to feather the nests of political districts. Of course not. You can do without the two martini lunch, but not the bridge to nowhere. This movie is about what happens to a man when he has high ideals. First of all, it's doubtful he would even be elected today. He would have to have millions and tell a whole string of lies to get there. Once there, he would have to see which backs to pat and butts to you-know-what. Still, Stewart does play a man of honor, one who thinks there is hope, and he gets his shirt tails caught in the machinery. The bad guys know that they may lose this battle, but it goes on to this day. All the cards are already stacked. Stewart's performance is masterful. He brings passion and commitment to the role. I like to think that he is something like the guy he plays. Frank Capra did a lot of work for the government and must have seen the ugly side. Some say his work is too simplistic. If the rest of America is collapsing around us, we should look to some of the optimism of the Capra films. Even if they stretch realism, they should make us think of the way things should be. I'm sure that were he alive today, some humorless knucklehead would be tapping his phone lines and screaming subversive.\n\nThe movie shows that there was polarization back then (1939) and the corruption in government had to be addressed. I wonder if there's a Jefferson Smith out there somewhere."

Portrayed beautifully by Jimmy Stewart, Smith embodies the virtues of the just and fair American man who, when called upon to do the right thing, will take a stand in an effort to revive the tenets of the documents we hold dear. Sadly, the brilliance of Frank Capra's film is that it demonstrates that men like Smith are a highly idealized vision of what an elected official (in this case an appointed official) can be. Thus, with the character of Smith, Capra and Stewart attempt to show that despite the special interests and power lobbying in Washington, that there could be men or women like him who simply want to make the best America they can--yet more likely, men like Smith don't exist or perhaps simply cannot exist.\n\nWhile Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is an inspiring film, it is serious about its message that it would really take more than one man with a false hope to change the nature of politics. In this way, the film has a timeless quality in that it is as relevant to contemporary political discourse as it was to politics of the day when it was produced. The enduring message of hope that there is a power from within each of us to fight for what is right is what makes this film such an important classic."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is not a perfect movie. (I don't know that there are any.) Jimmy Stewart's character early on is sometimes too naive to be believable for someone raised by a newspaper editor, someone who has studied American history as thoroughly as he has.\n\nBut when this movie is good, it is as good as any movie ever made, and I do not say that lightly.\n\nMuch of the power of this movie is in the uncompromisingly negative portrayal of political corruption, embodied in the brilliant performance of Edward Arnold, always a fine character actor, at his very best. His cold-hearted ruthlessness and drive never go over the line into caricature; he is always devastatingly believable, enough to send chills down your spine.\n\nClaude Raines, another very fine character actor, gives perhaps the most well-rounded performance in the movie, as a once idealistic politician who has allowed himself to abandon all sense of honesty in the pursuit of personal gratification, only to have his former, almost forgotten self brought back to him by the son of an almost forgotten former friend. Few modern American movies made for the general public would dare to portray such a character as so capable of duplicity for so long.\n\nJean Arthur is good, but her part is perhaps the least natural and most preachy. Eugene Palette actually gets a significant role as another corrupt politico and does a first rate job of it.\n\nBut then there is Stewart at his best, as well. Once his character, Jefferson Smith, gets shaken out of his naivet\u00e9 and comes to grips with the ugly reality of congressional politics, he delivers a performance as riveting as any I have ever seen on film.\n\nThis is no cheerfully optimistic Capra movie. In the end, Stewart wins not because the system works - in fact, it completely fails him - but only because one man slips over the edge. Once that happens, the movie ends two minutes later. The rejoicing is brief, because in fact Stewart's character, giving his best, cannot triumph over the Senate's corruption and indifference. Good does not win out over evil because it is better. It therefore left me with a most unpleasant feeling: politics IS as corrupt as we fear in our worst moments.\n\nIf you have never seen this movie, be sure to catch it. It is not another Capra feel-good movie. It is a masterfully constructed, by no means optimistic, and sometimes bone-chillingly pessimistic view of our democracy.\n\n----------------------------\n\nI watched this movie again tonight. Once it gets going in the Senate chamber, this movie is riveting, as good as movies get. Stewart's performance is unbeatable, directed magnificently by Capra. But again, as I wrote before, this is not an optimistic, feel-good movie. The Senate is corrupt, and goodness does not win over or change it. It is only because Claude Raines' Sen. Payne breaks down that the tide is turned. The movie ends two minutes later, as if to say that the whole group still smells so bad that Capra does not want to linger and deal with them further. I don't think that Congress is that corrupt today, but this movie is so well made that it still chills me to the bone.\n\n============================\n\nOn yet another viewing: I've changed my mind (2022). Congress is indeed every bit as corrupt as Capra shows. How horrible for us. But how devastatingly perceptive for Capra. He was right: even good men can be brought down by greed for power. Would that we could end Congress in two minutes the way he does this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Frank Capra is a popular American director, known for his cinematic masterpieces that tell about life in the city and inspire us with their stories about the human spirit. However, some people tend to criticize him for excessive naivety, which, in their opinion, is manifested in the final part of his films, where the main characters, even the most vicious and terrible, eventually find kindness and mercy. Such criticism, of course, has its own truth, but it is unfair in general and does not take into account the full depth of the meanings that are present in the works of this talented filmmaker.\n\nIt's no secret that often in classic Hollywood cinema, happy endings prevail - prosperous and joyful endings that studios do not want to neglect for fear of losing viewers, for whom this was a kind of prerequisite for visiting cinemas. Sometimes they are added to films where their presence is optional and against the wishes of the director. Such an event is typical of Frank Capra, however, I am sure that the endings of his films have deep humanistic roots and are connected with his philosophy, and not the willfulness of studio censors.\n\nJefferson Smith's character, masterfully played by James Stewart, is a vivid image reflecting praise for an ordinary person and his potential. Smith should be perceived as the embodiment of the best in people. Stuart's hero believes that it is impossible to win alone, and this is true. The most important thing is for each of us to root out the lies within ourselves. We tend to view corrupt politicians who are willing to do anything for their own benefit as soulless monsters whose genes are encoded with greed and selfishness. However, the position of the authors of the film is closer to the truth, and it is much scarier. They are the same people as us, who could not resist temptations and, thanks to their human weaknesses, became the source of all evil in this world. Who among us can guarantee that he will not be subjected to the same fate? Each of us, most likely, has sins and justifies them by the fact that no one has suffered.\n\nSatire is intended not only for entertainment, but also for self-knowledge. Often in satirical works we can recognize ourselves by seeing ourselves as if in a mirror. Thanks to such works, a person can, purely for himself, quietly thinking, realize some important things. This is the purpose of art. It is not about changing the world instantly, but about helping the viewer to become a better person, to atone for their sins by seeing them from the outside when watching a movie. To achieve this goal, the viewer must work hard on himself. It is important that not only philosophical treatises are suitable for this purpose, but also light and funny films, such as films by Capra.\n\n7 out of 10."

Surprisingly strong for its time - a mainstream film offering a strong crticism of the potential for corruption and graft that is endemic in a system built on the lobby and in a society where only money and power are counted as important in the social class system. In addition it offers criticism of the introspective and bureaucratically dominated political system endemic in any so called democracy where the process and the power are clearly more important to the participants (representatives) than the outcome. Finally, of course, it, yet again, causes one to wonder why on earth men are in charge of anything given their hopelessness and their susceptibility to manipulation by the superior sex.\n\nAs a light comedy, which appears to be the ostensible reason for its existence, it largely fails; being neither obvious nor subtle. Perhaps it is an early and worthy example of the satirical genre."

However, 'Mr Smith Goes To Washington' reminds me that my cynicism is merely a by-product of the corruption and b**tardization of what, in it's essence, is a country based on some wonderful ideals, not in fact of the country itself. James Stewart conveys the idealism and naivete and (all to rare) honest-to-God decency of newly appointed Senator Jefferson Smith to absolute perfection. I really believe that this is Jimmy Stewart's finest hour. It's damn near impossible not to be deeply touched by his performance. He puts across with real depth of feeling the character's complete conviction and belief in the fundamental moral elements that the United States was built on, and also his complete heartbreak when he realizes that all is not so clean and constitutional in his nations capital as he had perhaps always believed. The rest of the cast provides first rate support, the direction (Capra at his best) is impeccable, the script is smart, touching, witty.. you really couldn't ask for much more from a film. If you only see one James Stewart movie (or one Frank Capra movie for that matter) try and make it this one. 10/10."

        "review_title": "A strangely current film that, using comedy, shows us well the problems that affect our democratic system.",
        "review_detailed_main": "I only discovered this film a few days ago. It is quite evident that it has fallen into total oblivion and few people remember it. However, it is worth revisiting. It's a comedy in which an idealistic scoutmaster is recruited for the position of senator, finding himself in a corrupt environment where idealism seems to have disappeared. There is also a romantic plot essay between a congressman's daughter and the main character, but I think this is unnecessary as it serves absolutely no purpose.\n\nDespite being a comedy, the film brings us very serious messages that are worth reflecting on. The most obvious is the importance of fighting for noble values and just causes, regardless of whether they are difficult, raise objections or result in discomfort. There is a special nobility in pure idealists, even if their ideas are not very doable. The film also highlights the corruption in the political system, the promiscuity between politics and business, and the way in which a few men with political power and money control the media and stifle press freedom, restraining journalists and forcing them to tell their versions of the truth.\n\nUnfortunately, these problems persist, they have worsened and make the film very current. Politics has never been as badly attended as it is today; never has the poor quality of politicians been so evident; it has never been easier to be corrupt in positions of power; it was never been so clear the connection between political parties, big companies and banks, where politicians go when they leave the office. And with the amount of fake or highly manipulated news that circulates on social media like wildfire, it has never been easier to manipulate truth. For these reasons, our democracies, which we strive to build and want to preserve, are seriously ill. If people have dissociated themselves from politics, disgusted by what they see, and don't want to hold an office or exercise the right to vote, it's our fault, we let the rats take over the ship.\n\nThe film is not subtle, even though there is never any mention of political parties or North American states, and a clear warning is made that the story is absolute fiction. I can, therefore, understand the terrible reaction it aroused among politicians and the party apparatus, but it is still curious that it was banned in European dictatorships (I don't know if it reached Portugal, but it was banned in Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and of Francoist Spain), fearful that the film would show the advantages of the democratic system. In fact, despite ending well, the film shows its most serious weaknesses. I also don't understand why the US Scouts refused to be associated with the project, considering that the film portrays a really good image of them! Nominated for eleven Oscars at the 1940 ceremony, it was one of the favorites that year, but only won the statuette for Best Original Screenplay, which makes it one of the losers of the night.\n\nWith excellent cinematography and incredible work on sets and costumes, it was one of the studio's biggest bets that year. The number of renowned actors among the cast is quite remarkable and shows the commitment and budget available for the project. James Stewart knew well how important it could be for his career, and his commitment was total, providing us with one of the most intense works he has done. Beside her, the friendly Jean Arthur ensures a strong and impactful female presence. Claude Rains and Edward Arnold also deserve praise for their work on this film, as does Harry Carey, who said more with a smile than with a full speech."

I'm not like that. Maybe that means I lack culture. But I appreciate a well-paced intelligent drama such as Wag the Dog.\n\nSo when it comes to viewing the classics, sometimes I like 'em and sometimes I don't. Art critics don't seem to be able to tell the difference. Unfortunately, I did not find Mr. Smith Goes to Washington accessible. The story is syrupy, melodramatic, and with too much patriotic fervor. It's sort of a courtroom drama, but instead of fighting over facts and witnesses there's a lot of speechmaking about morals. The ending was as contrived as the one in Legally Blonde. Sure, it's inspiring to see someone fight for truth. But can we have some plot? Some characters with depth?\n\nWho should see this film:\n\n-- Arty types who appreciate the classics\n\n-- Regular folks like me who sample the classics hesitantly, there are better picks. And avoid It's A Wonderful Life, too.\n\nI believe in rating a film based on how it plays out today, not when it was originally made. By that standard, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington only gets a 5 out of 10, not bad given the passage of 65 years but no longer a classic."

        "review_detailed_main": "When \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" was released in 1939, Frank Capra already had a trio of Best Director Oscars sitting on his mantle. His latest film was met with wide acclaim and at Oscar time it was rewarded with an impressive eleven nominations (winning one). Today, over seventy years later the film is rightly recognized as a classic.\n\nThe story concerns idealistic senator Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) who is appointed to his position by superiors looking for someone who'll be seen and not heard. However, when Smith attempts to utilize his position for the good of his state's citizens he quickly finds that his proposed bill conflicts with an existing bill that was drafted with less than honourable intentions.\n\nThe cast is, in a word, excellent. James Stewart's Oscar-nominated performance is the bedrock upon which the film is built. He brings a sense of nobility to the character that could have seemed phony in the hands of another actor. Jean Arthur's world-weary character is similar to the one she played in Capra's \"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town\" and she once again does a fine job. The supporting cast also contains some noteworthy individuals. Claude Rains deservedly landed an Oscar nomination for his standout performance while Thomas Mitchell and Edward Arnold could easily have been similarly honoured. Harry Carey also scooped up an Oscar nomination for his performance though I don't think that it was really that extraordinary.\n\nThe film's only Oscar win was for the original story. The fact that the plot has the usual Capraesque elements would seem to suggest predictability but the screenwriters do a fine job of getting us invested in what's transpiring on screen. Capra landed an Oscar nomination for his deft direction while the editing, sound and art direction were also awarded nominations. These were all important elements in the film's overall technical appeal, as was Dimitri Tiomkin's stirring score, which was also Oscar nominated.\n\nIn the end, my only complaint about the film is that it seemed to drag slightly in the latter stages. This is perhaps unsurprising given the fact that the climax takes the form of a contest of endurance. Nevertheless, this amounts to the latter stages being merely good while the rest of the film is exceptional."

In many ways, the film is similar to 'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town', and it is not really better; instead of improving as it approaches the end, 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' is weakest towards the end. It seems to have a nice, feel-good air to it, so a \"happy\" conclusion is easily predicted, and if that is not enough, the conclusion itself is contrived. The final twenty minutes in fact are rather messy, and even if well paced to begin with, this over-sentimental tale does not stretch too well over more than two hours. There is a lot that makes this film worth watching though, even with its detractors. As well as the already mentioned visuals, Claude Rains and Harry Carey are excellent in their supporting roles, and the film does provide some insight into the workings of the United States senate and related politics."

In Frank Capra's 'Mr.Smith Goes to Washington', you're going to learn a lot about those two things that all humans should strive towards. This is an inspiring film, and an American classic.\n\nSmith is a shy man with little confidence when we first meet him. And it was a shock when I first met him. I have only known James Stewart as George Bailey, arguably the swellest guy to ever grace the screen. He, in comparison, is charming and headstrong. So to see Stewart, stumbling over his words was really something. His performance is outstanding. From his humble beginning to drained, heartful end, we see a character transformed by outside forces and inner strength.\n\nBut the titular character isn't the only standout. In fact, the entire cast is commendable. Jean Arthur is transformed from a cash-minded to a truth-minded person, with a growing liking for Smith like the characters in 'It Happened One Night'. Claude Reins is easy to hate as the political slimeball who thinks of himself more than the good of the people. As said before, the whole cast shines.\n\nI'd like to mention the beginning. Many older movies have very slow beginnings. Not this. Instantly we are thrown into the plot, with a series of phone calls and one hilarious \"NO!\" From there, the drama mounts, and the tempo stays high. 'Washington' could've been a dreadfully boring film. But Capra knew what he was doing. He has a thing for inspiration, eh?\n\nI would've given this film a low nine, if not for its one fault: the ending. The ending is so rushed. Right until the end, the film is a masterpiece, but then it just ends. The point is served, and we can draw our own conclusion, but 5 minutes of footage should've been added to settle things down. Capra would learn this several years later with his masterpiece, 'It's A Wonderful Life'.\n\nThemes of justice, sticking to your guns, corruption and more hit you like a political activist trying to drum up support. 'Washington' gives you many things to think about. And if not for the too-soon ending, it would be a masterpiece. 8.6/10"

Hollenbeck\n\n\n\nMr. Smith goes to Washington\n\nMr. Smith goes to Washington is a look into what the romance that our people thought politics were like `Back in the day'. But in reality politics are not even close to what they were at that time and they certainly are nothing even remotely close to romantic.\n\nThis movie lacked what you would call \u0091shah-bang'. It wasn't even close to being exciting. Lets look at the plot shall we? It's about this every day sort of guy, who publishes a magazine for boys. And then all the sudden he is elected to be a senator. How does that happen? And then to top it all off he doesn't even know a lick about law.\n\nIt was not a bad movie; it was just not all that believable. Would a real live blood-sucking lawyer of a senator back down from his verbal attacks just in time for the movie to end? That is just highly unlikely. If an opponent is beaten then why deliver them at the last second? If victory is within ones grasp then why give out at the very end? This just does not make much sense.\n\nThough it is predictable to following in the footsteps of the good old stereotypical American movie of the 50's. Over all this is a \u0091good' movie. This movie receives a rating of eight out of ten."

        "review_detailed_main": "MR SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON is quite easily one of *those* classic films that everyone has heard of but not everyone has seen. It's referenced in everything, from television programmes like The Simpsons through to American Politics textbooks. It's got that glowing word-of-mouth aura about it, kind of like another of Frank Capra and James Stewart's collaborations, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. You know the story even before you see the film: James Stewart plays small-town community hero and full-time Boy Ranger Jefferson Smith, the idealistic naive kind of guy who's an aw-shucks patriot and can quote chunks of Lincoln and Washington off the top of his head. When one of the sitting senators in his state passes away, the massive political machine controlling and choking the state, headed by the ruthless James Taylor (Edward Arnold), goes into action. It's already bought out the senior Senator, Joseph Harrison Paine (Claude Rains), and attempts to break Jeff's back when he does finally go to Washington and his idealistic hope of setting up a national boys' camp in his home-state runs smack against a dam-building graft scheme Mr. Taylor is currently hatching. With the help of sassy, worldly Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur), Jeff sets out to prove not only that he is innocent, but that his faith in his ideals and principles will win him the world and the respect he deserves, all this through an absolutely cracking filibuster that takes up the last fifth or so of the film.\n\nThere is much to recommend MR SMITH, but I'd like to concentrate on the acting. Three actors deserve special praise for their work showcased in this film, although the supporting cast is also excellent, from the page boys in the Senate Room through to Governor 'Happy' Hopper (Guy Kibbee), the sympathetic Senate President (Harry Carey), and of course, Edward Arnold as Jim Taylor is as crusty and mean as ever. However, the three top-billed stars must also take top acting honours. Jean Arthur is excellent as 'Call me Clarissa only if you mean it' Saunders--she's completely believable from first to last, from her initial skepticism about the \"Daniel Boone\" she was going to have to shepherd around, through to her last impassioned fight for and with Jefferson Smith to win through against the Taylor political machine and the Senate. It's easy to believe her when hardboiled city gal Saunders listens to Smith waxing lyrical about nature, about the wonders of the American system and political symbols, and melts--her drunk scene when she keeps promising to marry her buddy Diz Moore (Thomas Mitchell) because she doesn't yet know that she's already in love with Jeff is great to watch. One really cannot help but adore Arthur, always sweet, real, and very much a Capra heroine (see YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU, MR DEEDS GOES TO TOWN etc.).\n\nClaude Rains is, as usual, excellent in his role as Senator Paine: he creates a character who is flawed but essentially good, someone who is so used to 20 years of taking orders from someone else that he can believe he's just 'compromising'. It takes Jefferson Smith, of course, to make Paine realise that there can be no compromising one's ideals without losing something even more important--one's integrity. Paine's final impassioned scene, when he bursts back into the Senate hall, is a fabulous display of deep self-disgust. Rains truly is one of the most undeservedly unknown actors of his generation: a rare chameleon who blends into every role he plays so much so that he's appeared in some of the most famous film classics of all time (aside from MR SMITH, he also plays key roles in CASABLANCA and NOTORIOUS, to name just two), and is not only as well-known for it as he should be, but also isn't often recognised from film to film! His performance is MR SMITH is no exception: pitch-perfect and utterly credible.\n\nFinally, we come to James Stewart's Jefferson Smith, what must surely be one of the best performances ever committed to film--not just of Stewart's own filmography, but of every screen actor to date. He makes a potentially hokey, foolish character a real person, someone you'd really like to meet some day. By the end of the film you're cheering Smith on without reservation, and a lot of that has to do with the fact that you *believe* Stewart as Smith. From his first stuttery speech down to his final powerful filibuster, Stewart makes the role his. No person, dead or alive, could take on the role and hope to perform anywhere as well as Stewart has done. It would take some doing to keep the Washington sightseeing scenes from being oversentimental, and Capra manages to do so only when Stewart's expressive face is pictured onscreen, marvelling at these symbols of democracy and the American Way. (The flag montage goes on far too long for my taste.) Moreover, his filibuster scene alone could have won him lifetime achievement awards. Whether fired from within or aided by mercury (Stewart requested that his throat be painted with it so that it would be appropriately hoarse while filming the later hours of his marathon filibuster), it's quite a sight to behold. The fact that the Academy Award didn't go to him in this year is a travesty only slightly mitigated by his win in the same category the following year for THE PHILADELPHIA STORY. This film, however, truly contains the archetypal James Stewart character--an idealistic everyman-hero who loses confidence in himself but always comes through on top in the end.\n\nIf it isn't evident enough by now, the performances given in this film by the three top-billed actors is reason enough to watch it. However, MR SMITH also has a great script, fantastic production values, and a wonderful message. It may be Capra-corn, but it's Capra-corn of the first order, and will make you both smile and cry and believe that the world is a much better place than you thought it was."

        "review_detailed_main": "This intentionally was going to be a sequel to the movie \"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town\", also directed by Frank Capra, starring the same actors from that movie but instead the script was altered and an alternate title was given; \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\". But yes, when watching this movie it becomes visible how this movie could had worked out as a sequel to \"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town\". It features a similar sort of story about a random small time man who suddenly gets thrown into the big bad world of money and power. It a movie of a man against the crooked system.\n\nI must say that I like this movie better than \"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town\", while that movie on its own right also already was a great and fun movie. This movie however seems to be better with its comedy, in its first halve at least, which makes this an even better and more pleasant movie to watch.\n\nBut above all things it also has a better story, which works inspiring. Yes, it's a patriotic movie but in this case I can really live with that. It's a moralistic movie, concerning politics and ideals but without all of the sappy elements. The movie actually received an amazing total of 11 Oscar nominations, something not too many movies can say but it unfortunately only took home one award, for its writing. It received nominations in all of the mayor big categories. Besides its drama and comedy the movie of course also features a healthy portion of romance. Not a big shame that it didn't took home any more awards, when you consider that it was nominated in the same year \"Gone with the Wind\" was and some other great classic movies, such as \"Stagecoach\", \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Wuthering Heights\", just to name a few.\n\nIt features James Stewart in a great role. He always had the ability to play a character comical like but also with a serious undertone and effective during the movie its more dramatic moments. Also great was Claude Rains in a role, in which he was made to look much older than he in fact was at the time. His very natural acting style seemed to be ahead of time. Both actors received their first Oscar nomination for their roles in this movie. They should had won both really.\n\nOne of the best, most powerful and most beautiful 1930's movies I've ever seen.\n\n10/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "Mr Smith goes to Washington is a movie that teaches you the power of being resilient.\n\nFrank Capra and James Stewart who also worked together in the 1946 movie Its A Wonderful Life, pulled out a perfect combination of acting and directing that will make you the viewer want to be like Mr. Smith.\n\nIn a world where politics is a dirty game of, \"if you can't beat them, join them.\" Mr Smith (James Stewart) was faced with the task of being the odd one out as he wanted to stand for what he believed in.\n\nFrank Capra and his crew had their work cut out for them to ensure authenticity; an elaborate set was created, consisting of the Senate committee rooms, cloak rooms. The thing that really stands out is the reproduction of the Senate Chamber on the Columbia lot.\n\nThe movie plot is about a Naive and idealistic gentleman Jefferson Smith (James Stewart). Smith is the leader of the Boy Rangers and due to a gap in the senate he was appointed by the governor of his state.\n\nIn the senate he met a friend of his father who he looked up to, Senator Joseph Paine.\n\nIn Washington, Smith discovers the many tricks and shortcomings of politics. His goal to build a national boys' camp leads to a conflict with the state political boss, Jim Taylor and his childhood hero Senator Joseph Paine.\n\nAfter the powers that be tried to requite Smith, he turned them down and by so doing Mr Taylor concocted a scandal that ruined Smith's name.\n\nThe whole movie is then based on how he tries to defend his name.\n\nThe movie did stand high on drama with few comic relief moments here and there, but the story is what makes you respect and love this classic. We are use to movies that depict the good guy wining at the end, but in this movie bit of reality are exposed, to triumph in any battle you must be ready to go the extra mile and do what has not been done before.\n\nIn 1977 Frank Capra Jr. remade the film with another name Billy Jack Goes to Washington starring Tom Laughlin. In 1992 Eddie Murphy starred in a movie loosely based on Mr. Smith goes to Washington called The Distinguished Gentleman.\n\nThe film also influenced many other films including Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde and Evan Almighty.\n\nThis classic is very readily available now a days and I ask you to go see it.\n\nwww.lagsreviews.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "*** \"An average director is like a traffic cop, a good director does justice to the script, a great director offers to the audience a new vision of the world\" Bette Davis paying tribute during the AFI's 10th Lifetime Achievement Award to one of America's greatest directors: Frank Capra. ***\n\nIn each film, each frame was speaking his word, showing his vision, inspiring the audience with a feeling so new it would, like for Alfred Hitchcock, inspire its own adjective: Capraesque. And not every director could achieved that in their lifetime.\n\nI felt like beginning \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" with these lines because this is certainly, the most Capraesque of all his films. Released in the pivotal year of 1939, it's the picture that crystallized the very values the name Capra stood for, which are all about a certain idea of America, deeply rooted in the heart of this son of illiterate Sicilian emigrants who came to America at the age of 6, who endured poverty, and dreamed of getting through it. Not only he did, but he also became one of the greatest American directors, the one with the most instantly recognizable trademarks, as in both style and content. \"It Happened One Night\", \"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town\" or \"You Can't Take it With You\" made the audience so passionate about his films that his name would be top-billed. A Capra film was an event by itself, a film that would feature the struggle of one man, one ordinary man, against the corruption that gangrenes society. Capra's heroes were the incarnation of his own beliefs because in his own way: Capra incarnated the American Dream.\n\nAnd this American Dream would be immortalized through the most endearing of his heroes: the young Senator Jefferson Smith, played by a strikingly handsome and juvenile-looking James Stewart. The film launched Jimmy Stewart's career and if you see it, it's one point you'll never question. It's so amazing to see Stewart looking so young, especially if you compare with \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (where he was only 38), his features are those of a guy who can be 25 or 26, his cheeks, his awkward smile, his lanky demeanor, his eyes, Jefferson Smith is like a child, and when it comes to politics, like a baby. He's tutored by Miss Saunders, who's played by one of Capra's most familiar faces: Jean Arthur, and with her wised up experience, and cute nasal voice, she'll try to help him swimming among the sharks and not get eaten by the system. Because this is what the film is about, the fight of one young man against political corruption, a man whose heart is pumped up by all the ideals and values of Justice and Equity and finds himself alone in a world that belongs to other forces, forces that have nothing to do with government, forces that control everything. One man against the system, so Capraesque and yet so modern.\n\nThe real achievement of the film, although it was not necessarily brought that way, is to portray a political system that immediately echoes the ones we're familiar with, and my opinion doesn't target a specific country. Through the antagonist characters: the corrupted Senator Payne (Claude Rains) and Edward Arnold as Jim Taylor, the ruthless tycoon who owns the media and controls the power, \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" allows us to revisit the intricacies that still exist today within the political system and how some of the branches involved can lead to spheres that have nothing do with values and ideals. The all-time complicity between the media and politics is highlighted with such boldness that makes us wish we'd had more Jefferson Smiths today. But we don't, because to be elected, one must pledge allegiance to these driving forces: I call them the media, the lobbies, the major corporations. Because money creates more valuable connections than honesty, loyalty and integrity, yes they don't last, but it doesn't matter. In the name of progress, of economy, the big guys take the biggest share of the pie and leave the crumbs for people.\n\nBut Jefferson Smith will ultimately stand alone against this injustice, he's just a common man, as indicated by his last name, but his first name is patriotically loaded, as if he was the only virgin mind to inherit the purest beliefs that made the dream of his country possible. That's his force, he's as honest as the old man sitting on that big statue in Washington, and he won't let the word 'honesty' have its meaning twisted until it becomes synonym of naivety or lack of pragmatism. That's the virus that pollutes today's spirit, the whole cynical ends- justifies-the-means-thing that reduces gentleness to dumbness while we're more lucid when we believe that everything is crap. Why that's the point, if anything stinks is this world is because of a bunch of people that ought to be fought, and the cynicism of those people is to make believe that they're the one who adapted to a world that can't be changed. Through Jefferson, it's like Capra advocating his own ideas: no, he's not a sentimentalist, no, it's not just about David vs. Goliath, it's about beliefs and emotions.\n\nCapra obviously has an emotional relationships with his country, and so does Jefferson. It's something in the heart and Jefferson's fight literally metamorphoses him into a fighter who'd use every weapon to stand against corruption. And the Stewart we meet at the end is a whole new one, courageous, and determined, he lost his political virginity but not his idealism, because they had to triumph, otherwise, America wouldn't be worth living in.\n\n\"Mr. Smith\" exemplifies the best that could come from Hollywood's Golden Age, with so many familiar faces, and the greatest compilations of Capra's trademarks, fast- paced editing, jumping shots and the iconic montage of headlines and last but not least, a significance that hasn't been lost."

        "review_detailed_main": "There is a certain special allure to Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. There is little in the way of flashy editing or dazzling set pieces, only some fine actors delivering a wildly intelligent and sophisticated screenplay. But this shining aspect alone puts Mr. Smith Goes to Washington at a level of grandiose brilliance that has all the same appeal as a sparkling big budget epic. The movie is about Jefferson Smith, played by one of my favorite actors James Stewart. After the senator of his state passes away, Smith is rushed into office to hold the US Senate seat. Smith is naive but has a very big heart with equally big ambition. He pushes for a national boys camps with the best intentions, but when his selfless prospects get in the way of plans for a dam, two other senators, Jim Taylor and Joseph Paine, conspire to get Smith kicked out of office through scandal and corruption. It is a harsh criticism of the American government, but also a wonderfully characterized and extremely captivating underdog story which Stewart plays perfectly.\n\nI've already said a lot about the screenplay of this film, but I'm going to keep talking about it because it's just that compelling. The storyline of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is its shining aspect that makes it one of the smartest films of its decade. What begins as a fun little tale about a naive young man getting to play with the big dogs in the Senate becomes a darker and very critical commentary on the US governmental system. It's not to say that the film doesn't also remain lighthearted where it needs to be. It's a very pleasant story in which our protagonist prevails through his own will and determination. But there is a consistent theme of political corruption that only goes as far as a dam construction in the film, but alludes to more serious corruption that has sadly become all the more prevalent since the film was released.\n\nOne of the most amazing things about this film is just how relevant it is in todays society. Political corruption is a plague and a curse that we can't seem to rid ourselves of in this world. It only seems to grow to darker and more sinister things as the years go by, and at the time Mr. Smith Goes to Washington was made this idea of such corruption was so much smaller than it is today, in a world where under the table bargains are made every day, screwing over the good hearted Jefferson Smiths of the world. It's sad that we still see this corruption today, but at least it still makes Mr. Smith Goes to Washington a socially relevant piece of cinema.\n\nBut aside from the brooding undercurrent of this film, it really does have a happy message. It shows that through selfless and kind hearted perseverance we can overcome the challenges put forth unto us by the tyrannical fat cats sitting in their ivory towers, thinking they are invincible against the sympathetic little man. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington doesn't end on a dark note and it doesn't force feed us cynical thoughts about American government. Instead it uplifts us and gives up hope that there is good in the world. That's why I think James Stewart was so perfectly cast in this role because of how incredibly likable he is in any role her pursues. The character of Jefferson Smith inadvertently demands empathy, and that isn't difficult to do when he is so empathetically portrayed by James Stewart.\n\nMr. Smith Goes to Washington is a great little film. It's got a very socially relevant message, one that is transferred excellently from the marvelous script to the screen by exquisite actors. The dialouge in this film keeps you so enthralled in this movie from start to finish and the filibuster at the end of the movie is just as compelling and epic as any final battle sequence in an action movie. This screenplay does with words what other films could and sometimes even couldn't do with guns, swords, or explosions. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a compelling piece of rich cinema that shouldn't be missed."

He did not win, but that year was packed with outstanding performances and excellent films. He was awarded the \"Best Actor\" by the New York Film Critics Circle Awards.

He represented the common man, so what better way to get the masses on his side than to show him railing against corporate greed and yet still emerging from the murky swamp with his sense of idealism unblemished? Here is a character to throw your support behind and root for like the noble prizefighter who just won't lay down. It may be emotion in the rah-rah and flag waving sense, but his commitment and integrity gets the blood pumping. Hopefully it gets people thinking that if Jefferson Smith were a real man then they'd vote for him. It would be a vote for decency - a quality which we tend to find is sadly lacking amongst politicians in general.\n\nIf he were a fool then he wouldn't have my sympathy, but there's more to this guy than the simple patsy the top brass think they're recruiting... He has a few allies to help stiffen his resolve in the lions den, and one of the great pleasures beside the pure ethics of the tale is the canny way a gradual affection develops between Smith and his strong-willed secretary (Jean Arthur). It's traditional in virtually any setting to have a dash of romance that may well blossom, but don't let the earnest nature of Jefferson fool you into thinking it will be sappy. As the man becomes more confident in his new environment, he begins to get an education in all sorts of other ways, too - tastefully dealt with, of course. We as the audience learn along with him. Remarkably for a document of 1939, even as a basic civics lesson much of it hasn't dated and is disguised in an entertaining manner.\n\nIt's cleverly set up from the beginning that Jefferson Smith is a reverent and respectful man, so for me the misty-eyed sentimentality that underpins the story never grated in the slightest. Part of his appeal is that his core values manage not to change, so it would have been a shame to see his character grow hardened.\n\nMr. Smith got his shot at going to Washington. I urge you to take the trip with him. For anyone who still holds a shred of optimism in their hearts, it will not be a wasted journey."

        "review_detailed_main": "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is an honest and witty tale of the American political game. It also tells the tale of what happens when a simple and divine man suddenly decides to step into that game and play hardball. Jimmy Stewart gives his greatest performance in Frank Capra's funny and deliciously realistic take on the American political spectrum. This is truly a masterpiece of epic proportions with masterful writing, brilliant acting on the part of Jimmy Stewart as Jefferson Smith, Claude Raines as Sen. Joseph Paine and Jean Arthur as Saunders, and extraordinary filmmaking on the part of Frank Capra. It is truly a classic among classics and should have taken Best Picture away from Gone with the Wind in 1939. The same could be said about Jimmy Stewart who did not take home Best Actor for his performance in this movie. However, he did take it home the following year for his role as a reporter in The Philadelphia Story. However, that performance does not even come close to the subtleness of his performance as Mr. Smith. Complete with scandal, love, and history that would blow your mind, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is truly a film that the whole family could enjoy and demonstrates how brilliant a filmmaker that Frank Capra truly was."

She sees this dumb innocent guy come to town, that the rich and boisterous politicians are trying desperately to take advantage of, but he turns out to not be so dumb after all, with the help of Jean Arthur. Though he could have never have beaten them at their game had he not had her by his side, coaxing and helping along the way. The movie is one you won't ever forget. It's one to pass down from generation to generation, as i have done with my own children. You will be captivated by the awesome sites too of Washington, D.C. and the actors do their job tremendously. Buy it, you will never regret it. Other movies like it you will enjoy are Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, Shepherd of the Hills, and the Penny Singleton and Arthur Lake Blondie Series."

In the season premiere of The Simpsons Mel Gibson makes remake of this movie which Homer Simpson ruins. I don't think any remake can be as brilliant and excellent as the original. I instantly loved this movie which is as honest as its main character Jeff Smith. After the sudden death of a senator Jeff Smith who is popular among children is named senator. He gets himself into a lot more then he bargains for when refuses to go with the plans for a dam. This movie gives the audience an interesting look into the inner workings of the American senate. A powerful and compelling movie that leaves the viewer guessing as to what will happen next. James Stewart gives an excellent performance as Jeff Smith. Good humor and good drama. 10/10 An excellent movie that is defiantly worth checking out."

        "review_detailed_main": "Everyone has got something to fight for, to speak his mind about, to go out there and show the world what he's made of; it's just that not everyone knows about it or wants to use it. When it comes to people with great powers in their hands not everyone has the ability to stand up for himself, to say the word against them - being afraid of what that giant can do to him to shut him up or worse - but we should not be afraid. Size is, as everything in this world, a matter of opinion and therefore is debatable.\n\nFrank Capra's masterpiece, \"Mr. Smith goes to Washington\", was out in theaters more than 80 years ago and it is still relevant to this day. It tells a story of a country boy, played outstandingly by James Stewart, who gets elected to the Senate out of obvious reasons, as he is totally unfit to be a senator and wouldn't be a problem standing way behind the real people in control - but those people were wrong thinking wrong of him. There is just one flaw in a human being and it is conscience. That's the biggest flaw of Mr. Smith and he shows every side of it to the Senate in order to maintain his position, to speak the truth and to get people to think, to listen.\n\nFrank Capra is notorious for being a master in making dramas: just think of \"American Madness\" (1932) and the way he slowly but firmly unravels the story up to the breaking point when the main character seems to have lost a battle - but the war is still raging on. James is perfect in portraying everyday characters with big hearts and great minds; he makes us believe what is happening on screen and his pairing with my favorite Jean Arthur just doubles the enjoyment. Claude Rains and Edward Arnold are fantastic in their supporting roles also; I said it many times that Edward is just the right fit to play the villain although his good guys are indisputably remarkable too.\n\nMr. Smith shows us the way to become better by simply being ourselves and speaking our minds about something in hope of being heard by a couple of people who would care - and those people and who you really are are the things that matter. After all our conscience is all it takes to be a human."

This dam project is not that gripping but the deal, is like in early Tintin, easily understood: Tycoons pays politicians to be allowed to do what they want and they hold medias to tell their lies! So i suppose an enlightened citizen doesn't believe any of them! There a few good moments, especially when Stewart visits historical places of Washingtown and the Senate chamber is well done. But Capra has not the same inspiration and energy from Wonderful Life, it's for sure. The last thing i noticed is that black people are just for singing and taking care of luggages, like once again in the old Tintin! So the idea that just confederate states were racist is once more time just a myth: this Wasp democracy was played all over the country from Washingtown to Hollywood!"

A puppet in the puppet master's show\u0085they search for a coward that will do anything to be in and stay in the senate. Ironically, they find quite possibly the only man with true morals, Jeff Smith (Jimmy Stewart). Without going into too much detail about the movie, it must be said that the cast was brilliantly chosen. Jimmy Stewart is such a spectacular actor and can light even the darkest of a character. The fact that he's portraying an honest, caring man does him even better. Every line is sincere, full, and alive. He has such talent and grace on the set. He was born to be an actor, and this movie was lucky to have him. Jean Arthur put on a magnificent show. She was sheik but tough, distressed, but strong. In addition to the acting, the plot was solid\u0085flawless and catching. It got very slow and drawn out at times, but nonetheless, it was amazing. Frank Capra didn't go wrong in making this film. All in all, this film is definitely a keeper and very recommended. Having an overall score of 8.4/10 stars, this viewer doesn't disagree. A solid 8 for an astonishing movie."

The movie works so compellingly on first viewing that one doesn't mind the numerous problems in its screenplay. The flaws become more apparent on multiple viewings.\n\nI don't think it ranks among the very best movies of the thirties. The first half which plays like a screwball comedy is positively brilliant. However Capra turns serious in the second half when there is no basis for seriousness.\n\nNevertheless it makes wholesome family viewing. The performances, I must say, are exceptional without any exception."

        "review_detailed_main": "(1939) Mr. Smith Goes To Washington POLITICAL DRAMA\n\nProduced and directed by Frank Capra starring James Stewart as he plays Jefferson Smith appointed as senator as a result of him being used as a stooge, set up by corrupt senator leader, Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold).\n\nI have to say this is the best political film about corruption ever made which is still relevant in current times. This film does a good job on showing legislative power within our judicial system. And there has never been another political film made better than this!! Anybody with an open mind who also enjoy Frank Capra's other work such as \"It's A Wonderful\" and \"Lost Horizon\" should also be aware that watching this film is like watching another one of his finest."

        "review_detailed_main": "Even though Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is one of the most famous old movies of all time, there are a lot of people of this generation that haven't seen it. Any political science or American history student needs to watch it. There aren't any cell phones or computers, but it still hits home. The basic plot could happen at any time: an innocent person who wants to do good finds out that the political system is actually corrupt.\n\nA regular Boy Scout (literally), James Stewart gets appointed to fill an empty senatorial slot. He's very excited and very na\u00efve. He meets up with the senior senator, Claude Rains, who takes him under his wing. Claude is full of experience and political realities. You'll recognize a huge host of supporting characters: Edward Arnold as a corrupt party leader, Thomas Mitchell as a truth-seeking newspaperman, Jean Arthur as the cynic who gets fresher from Jimmy's influence, Guy Kibbee as an inept governor, Beulah Bondi as Jimmy's mom (of course), and H. B. Warner, Porter Hall, Astrid Allwyn, Harry Carey, and Grant Mitchell.\n\nThe most famous sequence is, of course, the filibuster scene. Jimmy wears himself out reading and making speeches until he literally faints from exhaustion. Though not entirely realistic (it still has the charm of 1930s optimism), it's an iconic movie that propelled James Stewart to leading man status. If you like the overall theme, check out the more modern comedies The Candidate and The Distinguished Gentleman. For a gritty, realistic take on senate committees, rent Advise & Consent."

        "review_detailed_main": "Released almost at the same time as the outbreak of World War 2 in Europe, Capra's masterful movie attacks the enemy within, the too-long tolerated party machinery in the U. S. Government which covered up graft and corruption at State level, in so doing contradicting and undermining the Constitution itself and indeed mocking the democratising efforts of governmental forefathers like Washington, Jefferson and of course Lincoln.\n\nJames Stewart is everyman Jefferson Smith the idealistic country boy, publisher of a free paper for children and who in his spare time runs a Boy Scouts-type voluntary organisation providing recreation for poor young kids, until he inexplicably finds himself pushed forward as his unnamed state's second senator. Pulling the strings is Edward Arnold's corrupt industrialist Jim Taylor who stands to benefit big-time from a government contract for the building of a dam. Trouble is, said dam is slap bang in the middle of where Jeff's pet project of setting up a national boy's camp is located.\n\nThe senior senator who accompanies Smith to Washington is Claude Rains's Joseph Paine. Himself once a young trailblazing solicitor, who actually worked alongside Smith's father fighting lost causes, he's been in Taylor's pocket these past twenty years and now takes his orders from the Man. He'll even stoop to setting the lad up with his glamorous daughter to distract him from the real business at hand. Next, he assigns his trusted underling Jean Arthur's Clarissa (pretty name, that) Saunders to distract and discredit Smith. Surely, with all this going against him, this hick from the sticks couldn't cause any trouble, could he...?\n\nCapra doesn't take a side in calling out Republican or Democrat and so makes the bigger point that corruption can be red or blue. He pulls out every stop to have you rooting for this Daniel in the lion's den, setting up Stewart for his heroic attempt to save the day by attempting a marathon filibuster to block the graft legislation, even while Taylor ruthlessly suppresses free speech by having all the newspapers he owns denounce Smith and so discredit and ultimately destroy him.\n\nOne might scoff at Capra's sentimentalised idealism, copied across from his earlier \"Mr Deeds Goes To Town\", their almost identical titles surely not coincidental, but again he pulls it off handsomely. The painstaking recreation of the House Of Representatives only adds to the veracity and of course he cheekily filmed without official permission, Stewart visiting the various symbolic buildings in D. C. for inspiration. He's helped once again by his brilliantly chosen cast, some, like Arthur who previously went to town with Deeds but there are great turns too from Arnold, Rains, Thomas Mitchell as a cynical old reporter who adores Arthur and Harry Carey as the sage Speaker of the House who sees the worth in Smith. Above all though, it's Stewart who seizes the moment to establish himself as an A-list actor by delivering a towering performance to effectively steal Cooper's clothes and so establish himself as the screen's top underdog, if that isn't too much of an oxymoron.\n\nIt was this film's misfortune to come up against the epic \"Gone With The Wind\" in its year of release (there was a lot of other competition too in that particular golden year) and see its eleven Oscar nominations translate to just one win but the Academy really should have shared out those little statues because this is Golden Age Hollywood storytelling at its brilliant, uplifting best."

In addition to being tremendously directed and written, it depicts a beautiful role model in the film's leading acting performance.\n\nJimmy Steward's wonderful portrayal of Jefferson Smith is not only convincing, but courageous, touching and heartwarming. In the 21st Century, during the fateful times of the current administration of the United States, this depiction of genuine political ambition and authenticity seems completely utopian, but is nonetheless wonderful.\n\nHighly recommended as one of Capra's film pearls, which hits a sore spot for the human condition of society's elite and most powerful, then and now."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is an incredible story of political drama that involves the issue of corruption and manipulation of the media and the impunity they have for carrying out these disloyal acts. Mr. Smith (James Stewart) is a popular and naive young man who is summoned to be part of the US Senate by big shots to cover an illegal thing with the innocence of the man.\n\nIt treats these subjects VERY WELL and especially for those years. It shows the political corruption and the relationship of those who make up this with the media. It's great to see the appropriate details of the inconsistencies that the characters handle as in the scene that the press tells Smith that he should not tell the truth because that's not something a politician does, the press takes care of that. Being funny because in the end the opposite is totally reflected.\n\nThe camera is meticulous and colossal at the same time. As the great monuments of Washington show, giving a certain patriotism with the phrases of their referents but as also later this gets dirty by entering the plot. A clear message of the love that the director has for his country but criticizing the incoherence of it system.\n\nThe small scene of Mr. Smith nervous with the hat having only one approach that follows the object, is very well achieved, it projects: shyness, nerves and emotion.\n\nPOWERFUL PERFORMANCES, James Stewart's character seems to be quite harmless at first but then has an excellent evolution, there is no more ferocious presence than is seen in the scene of the final judgment, he transcends from his voice to his weak body to defend his conviction. Deserved recognition with his nod for 'Best Actor' at the Oscars. Jean Arthur was surprising, her previous work in \"You Can't Take It with You\" made me irritable but she executes it satisfactorily, her character still suggests the little recognition of women in politics at that time (and that it still is), when she is the brain of Mr Smith and does not take any credit. The supporting characters were just as excellent. The nominees for 'Best Supporting Actor, Claude Rains and Harry Carey, were very good. The first has a role that is very repressed but that everything that he keeps comes out in that final scene with those screams at the top of his lungs. The second I questioned its importance a bit and if it was as good as for the nomination, I would have preferred Eugene Pallette as that cruel and manipulative head of industries but I admit that Carey achieves a pleasant atmosphere on the trial scene giving some hope and also generates a certain complicity of glances and smiles with the principal."

He was excellent in this movie that I saw today (fourth of July). This was my second time to see it!! The cast was great. Jimmy Stewart played Jeff Smith, an HONEST MAN (unlike Bush) and was appointed to the Senate. He wanted to overturn the corrupt POLITICAL MACHINE!!! He hated this Jim Taylor guy and so did I. Harry Carey was great as the Senate president. I liked the way he always SMIRKED and smiled. I hated some of the senators. Thank god Claude Raines's character came to his senses. The FILIBUSTER was great. Jimmy Stewart, in real life, stayed up 38 hours to add an element of realism. Howard Stern thinks James Stewart was kind of gay in real life and that his agents made him be with prostitutes to prove he was indeed NOT GAY! Any way, if you hate Bush you will love this movie. We need Mr. Smith in the WHITE HOUSE. Where are you Mr. Smith? The USA needs you in 2006!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Mr. Smith Goes To Washington is my second favourite Capra film to perennial Christmas favourite It's A Wonderful Life. This film has all of the elements that make a great film and still holds a slight bit of romance in the plot to keep the film exciting. If Capra ever intended to make a film based on Americana this one would surely fit the mould. Constant images of the historical landmarks that make Washington what it is are reminders of the greatness of this nation and the freedom that holds it together.\n\nThe plot idea of corruption in the U.S. Senate may have been the first of its kind. Jimmy Stewart plays the small-town politician who is chosen to replace a recently-deceased Senator. He is chosen because the powers that be believe that he will vote the way they want him to and not raise a fuss when asked to. However, when Stewart decides on an initiative that contradicts the plans that the higher-ups have, they raise a scandal that nearly destroys him, his beliefs in what America stands for and provides us with one of the greatest performances ever caught on film.\n\nCapra's direction is flawless, capturing the feel of tradition in Washington and producing the best acting from Stewart, Jean Arthur and Claude Rains. The manner in which we see the protagonist bent but not broken has been duplicated by so many other filmmakers, but never really done quite as well. The performances by Allen and Rains each added great scenes to this film, especially in the last hour when the good vs. evil battle is at its peak. I don't believe that any actor at the time could have given a more convincing performance than Claude Rains.\n\nThis film is another great Hollywood classic that I have been fortunate enough to see and I would recommend it to all.\n\n9/10 stars."

Claude Rains is brilliant as the Senator Joseph Paine who attempts to destroy Smith when Smith discovers his plans to build a dam in their home state.\n\nMr. Smith Goes To Washington has everything that makes a movie great.

This is a very good, very old, and very nice film that depicts our nation very well. Even better is Frank Capra, which some of y'all might have known in many other movies of the time. This is a great film, and I suggest that you watch the DVD version. Even though this is fullscreen (there was no widescreen at the time) and mono, you'll have a very eclectic selection of languages to choose from, so that you don't have to make this movie \"American!\" LOL 10 stars out of 10 stars, all the way!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Classic Americana about a young senator whose idealistic view of politics is shattered upon seeing corruption in Washington. Stewart has one of his best roles as the earnest, gawky fellow from a state that is never identified. Arthur is fabulous as his knowing secretary, and Rains, Arnold, Mitchell, and Carey fill out the fine supporting cast. As he's prone to do, Capra goes a bit overboard with sentiment and melodrama at times, but overall manages to create a film that ranks only behind \"It Happened One Night\" and \"It's a Wonderful Life\" in his oeuvre. The scenes inside the senate are well executed, although the ending is somewhat abrupt."

        "review_detailed_main": "Mr Smith Goes to Washington is from that wonderful Class of 1939 films that included Gone With the Wind, The Wizard of Oz, Stagecoach, Wuthering Heights, Ninotchka, Dark Victory, Of Mice and Men, Goodbye Mr. Chips, Beau Geste, Intermezzo:A Love Story, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Young Mr. Lincoln and Gunga Din. Wow! What a year. Two films rose above the illustrious pack at the Academy Awards for 1939. It was Gone With the Wind with 13 nominations vs. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington with 11 nominations. GWTW by a knockout with eight wins and two special awards while MSGTW only won a single Oscar for Lewis R. Foster and his original story. The story of a young freshman senator full of ideals who takes on the political machine in a tale of freedom and decency vs. oppression and corruption. This film is kind of an extension of Director Frank Capra's earlier film Mr. Deeds Goes to Town. Capra of course is the respected legendary director of such other classics as It's a Wonderful Life, Lost Horizon and It Happened One Night among many others. Capra's cinematographer Joseph Walker who photographed It's A Wonderful Life, Lost Horizon, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town and It Happened One Night as well as many other great films for other directors is here behind the lens. Dimitri Tiomkin scores the film. In the cast in their Academy Award nominated performances are James Stewart, Claude Rains and Harry Carey. Also in the cast are Jean Arthur, Beulah Bondi, H.B. Warner, Ruth Donnelly and William Demarest. It's a drama with a lot of comic relief. I would give it a 9.0 out of 10."

This is bar-none one of the best movies that I've ever seen, and that's not even close to an exaggeration. I love how this movie accurately portrays American politics, and gives us somewhat of a hisotrical perspective of the above. I love the main character, and I love the voice of the girl that's his secretary, her name escapes me right now, it's just so clique(spelling?). It has the knight in shinning armor kind of thing going for it, in a sense that the main character, Mr. Smith, is like a pure essence, and everyone else is evil, and it gives you hope for him and through him for American politics. This is the kind of America that Jefferson wanted, one that is run by the people, not by the elites of the country. This is by far the best black and white movie that I have seen, and for anyone that doesn't want to see it because it is black and white should see it, because it is so good.. You should watch it all at once though, I saw it over a period of three days, and I still think it's great, but if you see it all at once, it is probably so better since you don't have to wait to see what happens."

You will not get the true genius of Capra until you have seen a few of his other films. What makes this film so special is that it tells a story of a Washington D.C. in the early 40's that we still going on in our day. Capra has the correct formula for storytelling. Using simple real influences like a greater good vs. a greater evil. We watch how these two forces impact a common soul. These elements create great tension and good stories. I would recommend any of Capra's films to anyone who is not afraid to watch a movie that is still black and white."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'd not seen this Frank Capra film before, so I was very happy to sit down recently to see it. A long time coming, but it was well worth the wait.\n\nThe year 1939 saw some of the greatest of the classic Hollywood period: Gone with the Wind, Wuthering Heights, The Wizard of Oz, The Grapes of Wrath \u0096 and of course, Mr Smith. Now, having seen this one, I have to say I like it better than the others.\n\nAnd that's strange for me because I don't much like fantasies \u0096 because this story is a fantasy dressed up to look like a believable story. What makes this movie for me is, apart from Capra's directorial skill, the acting: all of the main actors \u0096 James Stewart, Jean Arthur, Claude Rains, Edward Arnold, Thomas Mitchell, Harry Carey, and H. B. Warner \u0096 give flawless performances aided by a scintillating script from Sidney Buchanan.\n\nThe story, as most know, revolves around a young man, Jefferson Smith (Stewart) who's pulled from obscurity to appointment to the US Senate, after the incumbent dies in office. Smith goes to Washington, sets up his office, engages a very engaging Clarissa Saunders (Arthur) as his PA, and sets about settling in. In doing so, he unsettles much of the sitting Senate when introducing a Bill for a Boy's Camp, to be built smack dab in the middle of an area where crooked senators had been finagling land sales prior to the construction of a new dam. Damn! They think\u0085especially one Senator Paine (Rains), a real pain in the posterior for Smith as he sets about initiating a filibuster in the Senate to gain approval for the passage of his Boy's Camp Bill.\n\nGot all that? It's not so complicated, really, and it's a lot of fun watching the players as they jockey for position, to get the upper hand on the other. There's pathos as Smith staggers about, exhausted, dispirited, almost at wit's end. There's high drama, as Paine denounces Smith as a liar and charlatan. And, there's love, sweet love, as Saunders - chaste Saunders - comes back to help Smith with his filibuster.\n\nToday's audience would probably regard the story as so dated. In many ways, it is of course. There is, however, an overarching theme to this narrative that's contained in the US Constitution \u0096 and in other democracies \u0096 having something to do with government of the people, and so on...\n\nSome might even argue that it's over the top, and I suppose it is: how can you expect any new senator not to become corrupted by Washington, given the excesses of the last forty years or so? So, that's why Mr Smith is a fantasy: such a story exists only in your wildest dreams. It could never happen in real life. Could it? Well, this is 2008, and look around at what's happening...\n\nThis is a film for all Capra fans. It's perhaps his best. And, I recommend it for all to see at least once.\n\nI also think it's a film that's still as relevant today as it was in 1939. In fact, I think it's one of those rare films like Casablanca (1942): it's timeless."

The film was made in 1939, so there are some areas where the times (and how far cinematic technology has come since then) are obvious. Camera shots cut away and back to get closer to their subject in the beginning scenes rather than panning in. But don't let this keep you from it. There are also some beautifully shot scenes and fantastic camera work. There is a particular moment when Jeff Smith (Stuart) first approaches the Lincoln Memorial. The camera is set up high above the scene and you look down through those grand columns as he approaches Mr. Lincoln. It is stunning. The acting is superb and James Stuart shows his comedic genius. Jean Arthur is beautiful and tough and unforgettable in her role. There are plenty of quotable lines throughout. Perhaps one of the greatest feats of this film, however, is it's timelessness. All of the themes are still relevant today and the characters are still believable in our time. I truly believe this is one film EVERY American should see."

        "review_detailed_main": "No filmmaker in history was more concerned for the underdog than Frank Capra, the champion of the people cinematically speaking. With practically all his pictures, he attacked corruptness and lack of freedom whether it be in politics, society or regular home-town settings.\n\nVery much like his previous Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is about an idealistic young man from a small town who travels to a big city with no notion of what he is about to get into. In both films, Jean Arthur plays the key role; the spunky news reporter/ press girl who finds herself attached to the title character in hopes of helping him make his dreams come true. Arthur is so good in this role because her dry, sardonic humor is wonderfully akin to the type of work environment she finds herself in: rough, lethal, and just plain unlikable at times. One of the keys that prevented Capra from making the same film twice was in casting James Stewart as Jefferson Smith. Stewart, one of the greatest of all American actors, is perfectly realized here; able to capture both the idyllic innocence and the fiery passion required for this role. Also well cast is Senator Joseph Paine, played here by the great Claude Raines who still remains known as Captain Renault of Casablanca, although he did many other films as well.\n\nNever before and perhaps never again has a film so thoroughly explored the way in which politics affect our everyday lives, even if we don't vote or read about action in Washington. The way Capra and his faithful writer, Sidney Buchman, establish each side of the spectrum and then lay out all the facts is quite amazing. Here is a young man thought to be a stooge; a nobody but simply able to play the patsy for the bureaucratic structure set up behind him. Unfortunately for them, his idealism and loyalty take over as he soon is poking his nose in places they don't want and asking questions they'd rather not answer. Every single step of the way we cheer for this Jefferson Smith, not necessarily because he is such a great senator but because he believes in life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness- things I'm sure we wished we believe in.\n\nIn a cynical and corrupt time, the political world needs a Jefferson Smith. However, for every Smith there are at least two James Taylors (Edward Arnold), pragmatic in every sense and ruthless. Another reason this film remains classic is that it cannot date. Its subject material will always be relevant, and for us it is a reminder that there are good people out there with a sense of honesty and humility. It is in these times we need reminded of what our government was originally created for: to help the workingman, the underprivileged, and all those people talked about in speeches but rarely dealt with.\n\nCapra knew how to deal with them and later on in his career, he and favorite actor Jimmy Stewart would go on and create another timeless masterpiece that struck notes deeper than just ideal politics or social behavior. Rather, they would make a film able to peer into the soul of human existence and find the very reason we have our living and being."

Now let me get this out of the way, I don't care about politics, I don't like politics and they bore me to tears, this movie sheds it in a whole different light. Jefferson Smith is an honest man not knowing how to handle his spot in the senate, but wants to do everything he can to help his country. No matter how much he's laughed at, no matter how much people beg him to quit, he keeps on ticking until he knows the truth, and until people finally accept for who he is. You won't find a story like this in the world now a days, it's practically guaranteed, but it really shows the American dream so to speak, and really lifts your spirits up when all is said and done. The end where Jefferson is speaking in front of all the people dead tired, is not only classical, but absolutely riveting and remains one of the most intense endings you will find in a movie.\n\nPerformances. James Stewart is absolutely wonderful in his infamous role as Jefferson Smith. His determination, his willpower, yet his strong vulnerability all made for one compelling character. Stewart is always dependable and I rank this as one of his best performances. Claude Rains is very effective as Senator Paine. He's not the man he used to be, and some of his scenes with Stewart really hit home for me. Jean Arthur is wonderfully classy as Clarissa. Edward Arnold is absolutely ruthless as Taylor, you'll hate him.\n\nBottom line. I'm not a politician, I don't know much about them, frankly I don't care too, they bore me. What I do know is I liked this film very much, and while it may be a bit dated too others, it's refreshingly good natured and really shows how corrupt America has become now a days. A required viewing for true film buffs.\n\n9/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The best way to learn about the history and government of the United States is to visit Washington, D.C.; Frank Capra's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington invites viewers to experience this through film.\n\nThe plot is interesting, if not a little absurd. When a senator from a state dies in office, a Boy Ranger head, Jefferson Smith, is appointed to replace him. Mr. Smith has no experience whatsoever with politics. Needless to say, there are greater minds at play. Mr. Smith's enthusiasm for his position is evident from his trip to Washington: immediately after leaving the train, he is captivated by the Capitol dome and takes a tour of the city. The scenes where he stands next to Lincoln's statue are immortal. The plot from there is quite unbelievable (especially the filibuster sequence), but nonetheless inspiring and educational. I don't think it was meant to be taken too seriously; it pokes fun at the nuances of the government.\n\nThe acting is excellent. James Stewart was ingenious as Mr. Smith. Claude Rains is effective as Senator Paine. Jean Arthur's portrayal of Smith's secretary Saunders is underrated. The direction from Frank Capra is great. He produces very clean cuts and cinematography. This is especially evident in the montage scene when Mr. Smith first tours Washington. The scenery, including historical monuments and the interior of the Capitol, is fascinating.\n\nMr. Smith Goes to Washington is an American classic. Its themes on democracy and government are timeless. Likewise, James Stewart's performance remains as fresh as ever. It is easy to forget that the film is so old. Perhaps the most important thing that it reveals is that the past is not so different than the present."

Nominated for 11 Academy Awards and competing against \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Gone With the Wind\" for Best Picture.\n\nThe story of a naive man becoming a U.S. Senator, the conflicts and fight he wages. James Stewart is perfectly cast in this role. He's an ordinary, charming, innocent and very like-able person. Jean Arthur as his secretary, Claude Rains as the senior Senator and James Stewart all give heartfelt, passionate acting performances. When Mr. Smith first comes to Washington, he has a childlike excitement, enthusiasm and idealism about him, that sets him apart from all the other established Senators. Though the story is set in 1939, the film does not feel dated, because of it's universal themes of integrity, patriotism and a passion for defending what one believes in, against the establishment. I was impressed with the authenticity and passion of the film.\n\nDirector Frank Capra had a nickname in Hollywood at the time: \"Capra Corn\". The film could be accused of being a little corny: overly sentimental and sweet. This was the style of Frank Capra, showing an ordinary man confronting extraordinary circumstances, which would be repeated in his later and excellent: \"It's a Wonderful Life\". Capra's films are admired for their naturalness and charm. I admit I'm a fan of his style.\n\nFrom \"It Happened One Night\", 1934, to \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\", 1939, to \"It's a Wonderful Life\", 1944, Capra had a trio string of excellent films, with his signature naturalness and charm."

Mr. Smith is so unsuspecting but you gotta love him. My favorite line is when Saunders tells him to go home and stop making people feel sorry for him. I was proud of Jefferson Smith when he took the Senate floor and gave a filibuster-it showed his determination to do what's right through it all! I think you will enjoy this movie. It almost made me cry sometimes at the unfairness of Senator Paine, Jim Taylor, and the Taylor machine. Some of the information is a little out of date-there are 100 senators now, not 96. I also like the president of the senate because he seems to be on Smith's side during the last part of the movie."

From the Greeks to the people movements the real meaning of democracy is not the chance to make the fast buck, but rather to expand and extend the human spirit to simply to build a better future from mankind.\n\nMr Smith is not simply idealistic it captures and encapsulates all that we would all want our governments to be, and all that we would not want them to be.\n\nAbsolutely hypnotic viewing and truly one of the greatest films ever made - some will charge it with too much sentimentality or idealism - I would argue that that's the point - we sell our dreams and ideals short - and movies at their best remind us that we can still hope, long for, and yes, even deserve a better world.\n\nAs long as future generation see films like this and Casablanca then hope lives on.\n\nA masterpiece to be treasured and should be seen afresh again and again."

        "review_detailed_main": "The term Capraesque when applied to film has come to mean sentimental, cosy and idealistic. But under many of Capra's superficially simplistic stories lurked a seed of angry bitterness. The desperation of the Great Depression is acutely palpable underneath the screwball romance exterior of \"It Happened One Night,\" and despite its reputation as a heart-warming Christmas film, \"It's a Wonderful Life\" has some very dark moments which effectively illustrate one man quickly approaching the end of his rope.\n\nIn the world of \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,\" everything of course turns out right, justice prevails, and American government is depicted as a body of men who basically want to do the right thing by their people. But it's also an angry indictment of corruption and the self-interest rampant in our government that existed then and still exists today. Rich politicians want the poor to stay poor (or they at least have no incentive to help the lower classes improve their situations), because it benefits them. This movie was pretty fearless for its time, when anti-government sentiment would not have been popular and would become even less popular as the U.S. entered WWII and patriotic fervor struck the nation.\n\nAnchoring this film is James Stewart, who deserves mention along with Jack Lemmon as one of cinema's great everymen. He gives a slow-burn performance here, at times very similar to the one he would give seven years later in \"Wonderful Life..\" Even given their darker undertones, Capra's films may still be too saccharine for some to tolerate now. But there's something appealing about his movies today. They don't shy away from tough issues, but they make you feel like Mankind has it in him to make everything turn out o.k. in the end.\n\nGrade: A"

The beliefs and biases of the film maker, Frank Capra, are clearly shown. We can agree or disagree with what we see and therefore the audience was shown far more respect than what we get from films today. In today's films heavily effected by political correctness most filmmakers will go out of their way to blur the lines, grey out the divisions and seemingly anticipate every possible criticism so that you never know what the movie is really trying to say. I think this is partly a result of the McCarthyist witch hunts in the 1950s which did a lot to silence any kind of honest political culture in American film.\n\nThe result of this more honest kind of black and white (yes both meanings are intended) film making is that we can really laugh, perhaps maliciously, perhaps sentimentally at Mr. Smith's struggles. I doubt anyone living in the era of Obama Barrack really believes that politicians like Mr. Smith even exist. If Obama isn't Mr. Smith, then who is? But we can identify with his frustrations and the cynicism of his secretary and other political veterans in the film.\n\nI like the fact that party affiliations were left out of the film.

        "review_title": "Picturing the Capitol",
        "review_detailed_main": "After the horror of the 6 January 2021 insurrection on the U.S. Capitol, I sought relief by returning to \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,\" a film that, although about political and media corruption, idolizes the building and champions democratic institutions and traditions. There are a few interestingly framed shots through windows of the Capitol dome, some at least of which I assume to have been done by multiple-exposure photography or rear projection (also, the ceilings inside the senate chamber are assuredly matte paintings). The Capitol is seen with awe and reverence by James Stewart's Senator Jeff Smith, and there's his iconic filibuster within, standing beside his desk once occupied by Daniel Webster, one of the figures from America's past venerated in the picture.\n\nTo call director Frank Capra's vague populism quaint may be an understatement; as John Cassavetes said, \"Maybe there wasn't an America, maybe there was only Frank Capra.\" \"A consoling myth of national character,\" as Robert Sklar put it. In between the other two films, \"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town\" (1936) and \"Meet John Doe\" (1941), of the director's so-called little-man trilogy, \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" is certainly a patriotic American film--excessively so even, from the start with the Columbia Pictures logo, a personification of the United States, to the Capitol dome and though all the national songs, Washington monuments, historical reverence, and Jeff's \"gee-whiz\" idealism and optimism. Pinning down what the film stands for beyond that, however, is trickier. After all, the screenplay was written by a communist (Sidney Buchman, who was later blacklisted), as based on a left-wing Democrat, directed by a conservative Republican and has inspired as politically-diverse figures as the writing of Aaron Sorkin and the presidency of former-actor Ronald Reagan.\n\nMichael P. Rogin and Kathlee Moran's essay \"Mr. Capra Goes to Washington,\" in particular, provides a good historical overview and analysis. As I sought solace from this picture of the past, it was itself a reaction to real-world criminal activity that pervaded a presidential administration (and on the heels of a pandemic toppling another administration in favor of the opposition party's candidate promising a return to normalcy, but let's not get too carried away with the historical parallels). As Rogin, Moran, and others have pointed out, the Willet Creek dam project in the film for which Smith uncovers graft is based on the Teapot Dome scandal (basically a bribery scheme over oil leases and which was the most scandalous bit of political misconduct in American history before Watergate) of the Harding administration, with Smith, from the unnamed \"that state,\" being a variation on Senator Burton K. Wheeler, Democrat of Montana, who helped to uncover the skullduggery of Harding's cabinet, as well as being the subject of a fraudulent counter-investigation, as is Smith, of being the one profiting from the corruption.\n\nThe film has also been seen as a product of the current, New Deal, Depression-era and eve-of-war events of its day. Understandably given the depiction of a corrupted Senate, if at odds with subsequent use of the film even at schools for civics lessons, the real U.S. Congress largely panned the film, with some politicians, including Ambassador Joseph Kennedy, suggesting it could inflict anti-American sentiment overseas. Reportedly, President Franklin Roosevelt was fonder of it, including more so than was Senator Wheeler. By the time the film was made, FDR was in conflict with the Senate, even with those like Wheeler from his own party, as well as with the press, over attempts to pack the Supreme Court and, when that failed, to do so to the Senate. Yet, the small-government individualism in the film of Smith holding up an appropriations bill funding such public works as a dam is hardly an endorsement of the New Deal, let alone the Popular Front of the era.\n\nAs historically interesting as all that is, it risks missing the point of the film's populist patriotism, which, besides, is relatively coherent considering the varying ideologies involved in its production. As Rogin and Moran argue, as did Capra in his transition to such socially-conscious \"important\" films, \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" represents the political power of cinema. This is such a well-crafted piece of filmmaking, too--even the montages climaxing with the Lincoln Memorial and Washington Monument and of a newspaper monopoly extending to police turning water hoses on opponents and to running boy scouts off the road stand out--it's easy to overlook the political confusion beyond the little man standing up against the system.\n\nStewart is very good. Besides Wheeler, his Jeff, short for Jefferson, is part author of the Declaration of Independence, part lanky--\"Honest Abe\"--Lincoln type, traveling to the home of George Washington, and with a last name of Smith that is more everyman in its commonality than \"John Doe.\" He's so boyishly naive that he's literally a scoutmaster, the boys of his troop having pestered the Governor to appoint him to a vacant Senate seat form his only lobbyist constituency. It's pretty funny at times, and I love the business with his awkwardness holding onto his hat. I'm hard pressed to think of another actor who could pull off such corny speechifying and with such appealingly unsophisticated bumpkin awe. His Oscar snub is one of the more infamous in the Academy's history and resulted in him being awarded the subsequent year for an inferior performance in \"The Philadelphia Story\" (1940) where he arguably wasn't even the best male actor in that film (i.e. Cary Grant is great in it). More importantly, his affable everyman appeal as a romantic, but not sexualized, lead would prove a great foil for his more devastating post-war oeuvre, including Capra's \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (1946), but better yet, Alfred Hitchcock's voyeuristic \"Rear Window\" (1954) and \"Vertigo\" (1958).\n\nThe supporting cast is uniformly good, too. Capra, exercising unusual control for a Hollywood studio auteur, sure knew how to pick 'em. Jean Arthur as the wise-cracking aide, part the film's surrogate spectator being converted to Jeff's \"lost cause,\" part surrogate director coaching him from the balcony; frog-voiced Eugene Pallette; silent film Western star Harry Carey providing Oscar-nominated reaction faces--reactive characters generally being important to the fine editing here--as the President of the Senate; Edward Arnold continuing a menacing turn as the political boss here after a powerful part as the capitalist boss in Capra's \"You Can't Take It with You\" (1938); Thomas Mitchell playing a drunkard again (as he did for an Oscar the same year in \"Stagecoach\"), even if his role merely serves as a springboard for Arthur's; and the greatest perhaps of supporting actors of classical Hollywood, Claude Rains, as the father figure and doing the conflicted character part of is-he-a-villain-or-is-he-redeemable act as well as always.\n\nGranted, the picture is so white and male-oriented that such boys have more of a voice in the political process than do women, all of whom except for Arthur's Saunders (complemented by Smith as, \"For a woman, you've done awful well\") are simply relegated to mothers or giggling girls, as African Americans are to servant jobs in this D.C. That's 1939 American politics for you. I mean, this is a film that valorizes the one-man filibuster, for which the only time a senator has really gone an entire day was when Strom Thurmond railed against the 1957 Civil Rights Act. Superficially, too, the debate here is between pork-barrel spending benefiting one constituency against pork-barrel spending benefiting another--but both from the same state and over what to do with the same parcel of land. Even despite Capra being an immigrant himself, as Rogin and Moran mention, the bad handwriting experts in Smith's trial are marked by foreign accents while the good expert spotting the forgery of the signature is American.\n\nA product of its times, revering the past, that itself has become a nostalgic classic of cinema. That movie house that Smith dismisses while admiring the Capitol dome lit up becomes a monument of its own and the most powerful form of media. Whether or not the newspapers, the corresponding writing campaigns in telegrams, radio, and even all of those telephone calls are ultimately effective against Smith's oratory within the film, the point is they don't succeed outside of it with movie audiences. It's the same with how he sees the Capitol, cinematically rendered, framed by windows like a film-within-the-film, as a symbol of American democracy."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hollywood, in the days of the studio system, was not a haven for individualists. Much as film writers and egotistical filmmakers like to ascribe authorship to one person, in truth cinema is by its very nature a collaborative means of expression. Hollywood, in its golden age, produced many of the greatest pictures ever, because the studios were like well-oiled machines for making the most out of collaborations. Mr Smith Goes to Washington is a great example.\n\nLet's look a bit at the history of this picture. Frank Capra, he of the \"name-above-the-title\" had had his biggest successes so far in partnership with a wonderful yet rarely remembered screenwriter called Robert Riskin. The story of Mr Smith Goes to Washington would have been right up Riskin's street, but unfortunately the writer, fed up with working in Capra's shadow, had decided to go his own way. Still Capra and Columbia wanted a picture that could be a loose sequel to Riskin's Mr Deeds Goes to Town, and would say about politics what Deeds and You Can't Take It with You (another Riskin script) said about wealth. A skilled and experienced writer by the name of Sidney Buchman was brought in to adapt a story by Lewis Foster. The result, while neither as witty or as charming as genuine Riskin, nevertheless made up for it with the devastating power of its message.\n\nOnce you have your A-grade script, you must get the right cast. Nowadays typecasting is looked on as restrictive and unimaginative, but it's part of the beauty of classic era Hollywood. Look at Jimmy Stewart, with his innocent face and frame so spindly it looks like he might blow away in a strong gust of wind. And yet when he gets going he has this boyish enthusiasm that makes you believe in him all the way. Stewart had first come to public attention in the top box office hit You Can't Take It with You, and had had a number of lead roles since then. For audiences of 1939 it would have been like seeing a dear friend step into the senate, and any modern day viewer who has seen a handful of Jimmy's pictures will feel the same. That's how he works in the role, and that in turn makes the whole picture work.\n\nIt's not just Stewart. Everyone appearing in this picture is perfectly cast, admittedly to type. Jean Arthur as usual plays the sharp-witted tomboy with a good heart, an ideal partner for the honest yet sheepish Stewart. The bulky, pointy-nosed Edward Arnold, in his tiny circular glasses, is the very image of the callous businessmen, and frog-voiced Eugene Palette is just right as his pompous stooge. All told, Mr Smith Goes to Washington contains a treasure trove of familiar character actors \u2013 Thomas Mitchell, Claude Rains, Guy Kibbee\u0085 each doing business as usual, and it is the very acceptability of them as their typical personas that makes this picture feel so immediate.\n\nAnd what about Mr Capra? Let's not play down his contribution, even if it isn't quite worthy of having his name above the title. Capra is like the conductor of the orchestra. Not only does he coax some great performances out of his cast, but he arranges things superbly to give emphasis as and where it's needed. In many of the early shots of Stewart he is shown in long shot in large spaces, like a little boy lost in a world he doesn't understand. In the first few scenes at the senate, Capra pulls a nifty trick with perspective, framing Stewart so that the top corner of the room converges with his head. The effect makes him appear very small, like those optical illusions you can make with two equal lines that appear to be of different sizes. As Smith gains more confidence and his words more resonance, he starts to emerge from this corner. In their quiet and intimate scene at Capitol Dome, Stewart and Arthur are shown against a plain background, so all focus is upon them and nothing will distract us from their words. All these techniques look very simple, but it takes a master craftsman to know when and how to use them.\n\nCapra no doubt thought of himself as a Jefferson Smith-type character, a little man standing up and making a big splash through pluck and determination. That's why he fought to get his name above the title, and essentially marketed the \"Capra touch\". But Hollywood is not congress, and even Jefferson Smith couldn't have done it without Saunders. No, this delightful and nearly perfect picture is the work of a wonderful, Tinseltown team."

        "review_detailed_main": "Frank Capra's fans give Capra high marks for his film making. He was a great Director. But Capra's detractors said he was known for his \"corn\" rather than art. If truth is art, then Capra fails, not to entertain, but as a truth teller. Capra is one of the first \"message\" directors. In this movie, he goes against the Washington establishment, political hacks and powers behind the throne. The sad fact is that nothing has changed because human nature has not changed.\n\nCapra creates the Character of Jefferson Smith, played by Jimmy Stewart in an great performance. The supporting cast performs as well under the direction of Capra. Whether Capra or the writers are to blame is not known, but the Smith character is a caricature of a real person. And because he is not real and the story is not reality. If this movie was considered a comedy, so be it, but critics have had 60 plus years to consider this movie as a significant comment on good versus evil.\n\nStewart's character is chosen by a shallow Governor to fill a US Senate seat and his choice is not \"the best candidate\" for the job. Nothing unbelievable in that, , but Smith's character is stretched beyond belief. To become a US Senator, you must be at least 30 years old. Smith is introduced as someone with the maturity of a 15 year old. With no wife, no girl friend; he acts like a 15 year old when introduced to mature women. Taking a tour of Washington leaving his homing pigeons to the care of others, is also the behavior of an adolescent. Capra wants us to believe that adolescence is synonymous with honesty. It is not. Nor was his striking journalists who portrayed him as a dope.\n\nSomehow this idealistic character takes on the corruption of the world in the form of a junior Senator and conquers all. And discovers love and gets the girl in the end. If you like vintage syrup, this movie is right for you. Just remember, its just a movie, and in real life, the bad guys usually win."

        "review_title": "Frank Capra's indictment of political corruption is framed as an endearing David and Goliath narrative anchored by Stewart's conviction hidden behind small town simplicity.",
        "review_detailed_main": "After a sitting United States senator dies, this rallies corrupt Political Boss Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold) and surviving senator from the same state Joe Paine (Claude Raines) to action to find a replacement so they can push through approval of the Willet Creek Dam project. While the governor can't appoint Taylor's handpicked replacement without committing political suicide, he is soon inspired by his young sons to pick respected Boy Rangers leader and local hero Jefferson \"Jeff\" Smith (James Stewart) believing his popularity will keep him safe politically, while his naivety will allow the passage of the dam project. As Jeff unsteadily enters the halls of political power, he is taught the ins and outs of the process by his jaded secretary Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur) who initially doesn't buy into his convictions about American virtues and values having seen that veneer from many before him. As Jeff attempts to push through his own legislation for a Boys' Camp that would allow for more easy access to outdoor activity and embrace of nature, Smith soon finds himself face to face with the insidious political machinations that he soon fights against.\n\nMr. Smith Goes to Washington is a 1939 politic drama from Frank Capra. After the initial pitch from Lewis R. Foster was purchased, the initial intend was to make the film a sequel to Mr. Deeds Goes to Town with the title called Mr. Deeds Goes to Washington, but when Gary Cooper became unavailable Capra reworked the film as a vehicle for James Stewart. When the script was first submitted to the Hays Office for approval, the head of the office initially warned of the provocative nature of the film feeling it was a \"covert attack on Democratic government\" but eventually reversed course and allowed the film to continue without alteration after noting how it espoused the virtues of government to the people, by the people, and for the people. The movie was a sizable financial success upon its release being the third highest grossing film that year behind Gone with the Wind and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and was nominated for several Academy Awards including Best Picture which it was lost to Gone with the Wind. The film has been seen as one of the best film's in Capra and Stewart's filmographies possibly only dwarfed by their collaboration on It's a Wonderful Life and is know for being one of the great whistleblower films and laying the groundwork for other similar provocative films. And rightly so because despite the film showing a more pessimistic side of Capra, the bitter truths are wrapped in a harrowing journey of one man fighting for an establishment against an encroaching rot.\n\nIt should surprise no-one that James Stewart effortlessly plays Jeff Smith with a good balance of humor and pathos wherein while he does have some bumbling charm to him, there's also a sincerity and passion for Government in his performance that lends credence to his belief in doing good for the people of his home state. At his core, Jeff Smith is a man of simple virtues who believes in doing right by the people without compromise to anything that would do them harm which places him into conflict with the establishment including Claude Rains' Senator Paine who has built his 20 year career on compromising himself with Jim Taylor's wishes giving justification that what good he may do elsewhere balances out the scales. We also get Jean Arthur's Clarissa Saunders who's very much the polar opposite of Stewart in that she's been in Washington long enough to know how the game is played and is very much a counterweight of pessimism to Smith's optimism with her arc of regaining faith in the process well positioned to Smith's weathering of the forces that eventually seek to smear his name with lies and slander that makes their low-key romance very endearing. The movie gives us a memorably despicable villain in Arnold's Jim Taylor and when we see the levels to which he stoops hiring back channel thugs to intimidate Smith's allies and utilizing his monopoly on communications to fortify his lies, it's a searing indictment of not just political cronyism and intimidation, but also a sobering reminder of why bloated consolidated powers when left unchecked will seek unlimited expansion at the expense of those underfoot like a plague.\n\nMr. Smith Goes to Washington is a great film and its message despite being made in the late 1930s still resonates today even if the Jim Taylor's of the world now bear new names and guises. While the movie is a critique on political corruption, it also works as strong crowd pleasing yarn of one man being able to stand up and make a difference."

        "review_detailed_main": "In a nutshell, Stewart plays an everyday man and before he knows it, the senior Senator Joseph Paine (brilliantly portrayed by Claude Rains), a man Smith admired all his life and who took Smith under his wing like a true mentor would, suddenly turns 180 degrees and convinces the Senate body that Smith's expulsion would be of best interest. It so happens that Paine and party boss/newspaper tycoon Jim Taylor (neatly played by the sinister Edward Arnold) are involved in a crooked irrigation plot that just happens to be where Smith wishes to establish his camp. Smith is dumbfounded to learn that he has been framed and that all kinds of opposition, including newspaper stories, billboard posters, radio announcements, telegrams, etc. Are all in favor of his being expelled, and yet he did nothing wrong; everything was doctored up by Taylor and his assorted heavies. Smith is so disheartened that he intends to leave Washington, but it is this chain of events that brings out the better qualities of Smith's feisty secretary Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur), who encourages him to stay and fight back. He does, and his nearly twenty-four-hour filibuster is filled with memorable quotes and light touches of humor. To me, Jefferson Smith is a true hero because he is an ordinary man faced with overwhelming loads of corrupt opposition, and yet he decides to stick to his guns and fight. He eventually loses his voice and faints, but he still wins the day as Paine rushes back into the Senate and all torrents and chaos emerge.\n\n10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's not often you could proclaim a film to be entirely wholesome, but it's a proclamation you could rightfully bestow upon one of director Frank Capra's crowning achievements Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, a good-hearted and unashamedly sappy exploration of a good man trying to uphold justice in a corrupted political environment, that whilst at times too sentimental and dramatic for its own good, remains a joy to watch in this modern day that could do with more Frank Capra's and characters such as James Stewart's Jefferson Smith.\n\nMaking a star of its leading man, who later on in the 40's would re-team with Capra to make one of the most beloved films of all time It's a Wonderful Life, Stewart and Capra create magic together here as they bring to life the tale of Jefferson Smith being thrust into the U. S senate in hope the political parties ruling the house can manipulate their new colleague due to his kind nature and rose tinted view on the world.\n\nWhat follows is a fairly Hallmark like procedural filled with much talking and hypothesizing as Smith battles to clear his name from fraudulent claims while trying to do good with his new power but the chance of being non-invested or not encouraged by this smile inducing battle against good and evil is only likely to fall on those with the most stone cold of hearts, a sentiment backed by the fact Washington remains well entrenched within countless top films of all time lists.\n\nA proud citizen, Capra's love for his country and the political system that is by the people for the people is on display here, while Stewart manages to balance out Smith's na\u00efve nature in a brilliant performance that in the wrong hands could've sunk and sunk quickly as audience's failed to be captured by a figure that surely to goodness couldn't be that blind too what is going on around him.\n\nIt's impossible to think of a film like Washington coming to play today, with features such as Forrest Gump or even Paddington 2 coming to mind when you try and nail down the type of tone and sentiment the film delivers but coming from a unique time and place and two minds of some of Hollywood's all time great figures ensures this effortlessly likable and fun tale will continue to be a benchmark for feel good affairs long into the future.\n\nFinal Say -\n\nThere are some moments that are a little too much to bare but for the most part Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a wondrously enjoyable drama that will make you believe in all the good that's in the world, the perfect antidote for the time and place we all find ourselves in at present.\n\n4 hoarse voices out of 5.\n\nFor more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"

His ignorance and gullibility were offset by his strength of will and integrity. Great performance. Jean Authur was a delight as a tough, hard bitten insider who, after a bit of fighting with herself, melts and falls in love with the idealistic and naive Jeff Smith. Idealism and romance don't get any better than this. And this movie has nothing to do with civics-it is a fantasy. But if you enjoy a good-no great-old fashioned movie, this is the one to watch."

When a Senator passes away corruption threatens to step in until Jeffrey Smith is brought to the scene. Smith is seen as an honest man in awe of the Washington he has only dreamed about. He desires to do good by passing a bill to open a Boys Rangers camp but corrupt oppositions plan to build a dam there and counter Smith by smearing his name via fraud and damaging his reputation. Director Frank Capra is at his best in one of his greatest achievements. James Stewart plays off the wonderment and determination of Smith right up to the point where he stands practically alone against the Senate to defend himself against false accusations in a rousing climax. Jean Arthur plays his cynical secretary devoid of trusting the system until Smith sparks new hope that has her backing him up. Claude Rains plays Senator Paine who was friends with Smith's father but is now instructed to publicly destroy him. Rains reveals guilt and is pulled between integrity and corruption. Edward Arnold plays antagonist Jim Taylor who is determined to crush Smith. Thomas Mitchell plays Arthur's smitten aid."

        "review_title": "Very Important Film!",
        "review_detailed_main": "Frank Capra, the legend behind classics like It Happened One Night, created what is probably the most sensational film of his career, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. When released, it created a stir within Washington insiders and around the globe. The movie appeals to the tendencies of Capra as a director using themes such as idealism and hope. But if one looks closely, you can see ideas of pessimism start creeping in the mind of Capra. Regardless, Capra created a film that resonates with all ages and generations. With the idea of the filibuster being in the news lately, the relevance of Capra's picture is still prevalent with Americans in today's day and age. As a film itself, the movie does a great job switching gears from comedy to tense drama. The performances, especially from the great Jimmy Stewart, are all fantastic. I also really loved the ending!\n\nBefore the film was even in production, Sidney Buchman's screenplay already had Hollywood in a frenzy. Joseph Breen, the head of the Hays Code office, warned studios how explosive the project is and told them it could be an attack on the democratic process, so he suggested some changes. Boy, was he ever right that it would be explosive. The film had a screening in Washington and rumors had it that senators walked out. Regardless, they did not like how they were depicted as corrupt and were heavily involved in breaking up studio theatre chains in the 1940's. The film was banned in Nazi Germany and Mussolini's Italy because it showed, in their eyes, how democracy is a legitimate form of government that works. Nowadays, many film, history, and political science classes use this movie to compliment the lessons. Despite the film driving politicians crazy, it became a major hit with critics and audiences.\n\nAs a film itself, it mostly works for me. I thought the film got off to a bit of a slow start but once the plot moves forward, so does the film. Originally, Capra designed his feature as a sequel to his hit Mr. Deeds Goes to Town but thought better of it. Once James Stewart, the everyday idealistic actor that every American loved joined the project, Capra decided to make it a standalone picture.\n\nJefferson Smith (James Stewart) is appointed the empty senator vacancy spot after the passing of one of the senators. He is an idealistic, na\u00efve young man who heads The Boy Rangers. Jefferson is eager to use this position to pass a bill involving the Rangers. On the other side of the spectrum, Jefferson is most likely elected due to his lack of political experience and that he could be taken advantage of by other higher-ranking senators. He reunites with the state's lead Senator, Joseph Paine (Claude Rains) who is well-respected...and corrupt. He is under the influence of powerful businessman, Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold). Once Jefferson arrives in the nation's capital, it becomes clear that he will be used for a dam bill...that will be in conflict with Paine's bill. Originally seen as a pushover, including from his cynic secretary Saunders (Jean Arthur), will Jefferson have the strength to stand up to these powerful men who could easily destroy his political career if they wanted?\n\nThroughout, the performances were excellent. James Stewart has enough of that idealistic charisma to make me believe in his cause. His final scenes are very, very powerful. He also exhibited great chemistry with Jean Arthur. Her character is a cynic at first because she knows how Washington works, but once she understands Jefferson's attitude and ambitions, she starts to believe again. The supporting cast, especially Claude Rains, deliver the goods. Rains really made Paine a nasty piece of work. Like with most of his films, Capra makes clear who the good guys and the bad guys are in his movies-no exception here. For the first time, Capra gives his characters hints of pessimism, but he does not truly leave the idea of hope and being able to believe in one's self too far way.\n\nOverall, there is no denying that Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a classic. As a film, it is funny, heartfelt, dramatic, and memorable. It has themes that resonate with all ages and professions. The direction, performances, and script are about as perfect as they can be. The pacing is somewhat slow to begin, but when I was hooked, I was hooked! In terms of the impact it had around the world, the film created domestic and international impacts which is described in above review. 1939 was a gigantic year in film. The Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind are flashier pictures, but do not forget about Capra's tour-de-force in a career where he made many of those. It is and shall remain a very important movie.\n\nMy Grade: A-"

        "review_detailed_main": "There's an interview somewhere with Bette Davis enthusing about the skills of Claude Rains, and I think this is an example of just what she meant. He is the established senator (\"Paine\") who has taken the rather stoic view that representing big business some of the time allowing him to represent his electorate the rest of it is a path worth following. When his colleague suddenly dies, it falls to the very political machine he serves to find a replacement. The hapless governor (Guy Kibbee) couldn't make a decision if his life depended on it, but thanks to a lively family dinner alights on local boy scout leader \"Jeff Smith\" (James Stewart). The man in charge - \"Taylor\" (Edward Arnold) is convinced that this naive and optimistic young man can do no harm to a pressing project they are hoping to pass through the Senate imminently. Duly appointed, our trusting and doe-eyed young gent heads to a Washington DC where an admittedly rather sentimental bus tour reminds him that he is the heart of his great democracy. \"Paine\" has assigned the wily \"Saunders\" (Jean Arthur) to keep an eye on him, and pretty soon they have suggested he find a pet project. A camp for boys from underprivileged backgrounds. That's got to be a benign concept - except, well soon he's got the establishment that sent him there in a complete and pretty violent tizz! Gradually, \"Smith\" realises that his fanciful desires for his nation are but an illusion. Can he still win through, though? Frank Capra can't resist a little flag waving at the beginning, but once this story gets into it's stride it's a powerful evaluation of just how undemocratic democracies can be. Big business and vested interests prevail - however altruistic they may originally intend to be. Stewart delivers a character brimming with authenticity and integrity; ably assisted by the quick-tongued and very much on-form Arthur and by the always reliable Thomas Mitchell as the gin-soaked reporter \"Diz\" we build convincingly to a conclusion that.. well you'll have to watch. It's a great drama this, plenty of pace and a script that keeps each persona and the whole scenario engaging from start to finish. One of the best, I reckon - and if you can, it's well worth seeing on a big screen for two hours that flies by."

During my many visits to to DC, I've always been overwhelmed by somewhat sappy feelings of patriotism, similar to those exhibited by Stewart's character.\n\nThe main point deductions from my rating are due to the hypocrisy of Right Wing \"conservatives,\" Stewart & Capra failing to recognize that Smith, the honorable good guy, is the Liberal/Democrat doing battle with the corrupt corporate bad guy Republican types.\n\nSame is true of their collaboration, It's a Wonderful life. The greedy, cruel, dishonest, corporate Mr. Potter behaves just like a RW Republican and nothing like a liberals/Democrat who fights far more for George Baileys of the world and against the mean, evil Mr. Potters. How they or anyone couldn't recognize this is mind-boggling and in large part due to deceptive, cynical RW propaganda."

        "review_title": "One More Take: Mr Smith Goes to Washington",
        "review_detailed_main": "Who doesn't love Jimmy Stewart? A lanky bumbler who defeats bad guys with the power of morals, he is oddly magnetic and eminently personable in virtually every picture he stars in. My mother, in this vein, calls him the \"Old Hollywood version of Tom Hanks.\" While Stewart had enjoyed a string of roles leading up to this, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is, in retrospect, one of the great standouts of the actor's early era, next to It's a Wonderful Life.\n\nSimilar to that film, and as a bolstering of my little lead-in, the movie at its core is about a good person winning out, after much tribulation, against forces that seek to oppress and ruin him. This is framed here in a narrative that concerns a young, innocent senator with high-minded classical American ideals (cut to Stewart staring at awe at the pensive, austere statue of Abe Lincoln) doing battle against the forces of government corruption.\n\nThe film, at the outset, is fully steeped in Stewart's own naivete, so that you could be forgiven for thinking the entire picture might continue rapt in its somewhat corny, apple-pie tonality, but it does not. Instead, and appreciably, it leaves the baseball game running on the TV upstairs, goes down to the cellar, and pokes around in the corners. Which is to say, the idealized vision of America that define both Stewart and the film take a drastic nosedive when within the heart of the cherished governmental system, with all its grandiloquent language of freedom and unimpeachable morality, a seemingly unbeatable cancer is found to lurk. The film thus follows the well-known hero's journey path, resulting, of course, in victory for the little guy, as Smith mounts a heroic filibuster against the forces of greed and corruption.\n\nGranted, this is Hollywood. We've had 80 years of evidence since Smith went to Washington in support of the fact that the vast majority of the time, the hyenas and greedheads of the world come out on top, pockets lined with blood money that seems to lose them no sleep. Some might consider this a mark against the film, marking it as an idealization incongruous with reality. I would posit otherwise, however. The fact that things like this do not often happen, but could, even if that window feels more and more diminished as America continues its swan dive into inequality and general horror, is an important gesture towards the concept of holding strong to ideals even as the jaws snap down.\n\nBut let's back up, before I journey too far into this little minefield. After all, it is not through starry eyes of idealism that I like this movie, but because it's a damn good movie, and what we like about films like this IS the fact that the good guy wins out over, as Hunter Thompson might say, \"the forces of old and evil,\" regardless of realism. To reiterate, it's Hollywood. If you want hardcore fatalism, there are plenty of other movies that will fit the bill, but a feel-good Capital Hill romp with spastic, geeky, affable everyman Jimmy Stewart is not where you want to look. This is not Fight Club (although you should definitely see Fight Club).\n\nFINAL TAKE: Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is simultaneously a bolstering of the American ideal, and an indictment of those that would take advantage of it. However you view said ideal, however, whether it lives in your heart or you call \"Fraud!\" on the whole damn architecture from the get-go (I tend to fall into the latter category, in all honesty), these things are essentially a backgrounding for a well-done, gripping, and often very funny story of a man who refuses to sacrifice ideals. The filmmaking is superb, the central and supporting cast are just fantastic (special mention to the great Jean Arthur as Stewart's cagey, disillusioned secretary), and it draws your attention from the first frame to the closing credits, leaving you with the gratified sense of a victory well-earned. It may not be the sort of victory we get to enjoy very often in reality, but hey, that's why we have movies, and one of the reasons we love them. In a way, it makes such a sensation even more special. Life is often bleak, ponderous, and wholly cruel, where the payoffs are thin, if they exist at all. A movie needn't submit to this reality, but can give us something different, and, should it choose to do so, something better. And if Jimmy Stewart is stammering and fumbling with his hat? Sign me up, baby.\n\nAll right. I'm done. I'd like to thank the Academy. Kisses to all of you."

        "review_title": "Frank Capra's Classic Looking at the Halls of Congress",
        "review_detailed_main": "Just before the national release of October 1939's \"Mr. Smith Goes To Washington,\" Columbia Pictures let the National Press Club, made up of D. C. reporters who cover the White House and the United States Congress, to hold a special showing of the movie at Constitutional Hall, with 4,000 guests and 45 U. S. Senators in attendance. Director Frank Capra and his wife were sitting with the family of Senator Burton Wheeler of Montana. During the middle of the film whose theme was centered around corruption in Congress, Capra saw Wheeler get up and leave. Most of the audience watching the movie was silent at best, while some reportedly followed Wheeler's example and left the building before the end.\n\nMany journalists that evening felt \"Mr. Smith Goes To Washington\" unfairly portrayed the press as nothing but a bunch of heavy drinkers, with one tipsy newspaper editor during the post-showing party taking a swing at Capra. The next day, most reviews from the city's newspapers were critical of Capra's latest effort. Senate Majority Leader Alben Barkley said the film was \"silly and stupid and it makes the Senate look like a bunch of crooks.\" Democratic Senator from West Virginia Matthew Neely introduced a bill called the Neely Anti-Block Booking Bill, which would stop the major studios from requiring its theaters from paying in advance a year's worth of movies, in retribution to what he saw as Hollywood's smears on his chamber. The timing of Capra's picture couldn't have been worse, according to the United States Ambassador to Great Britain Joseph P. Kennedy, who saw Europe plunging into World War Two a month earlier. He wanted Columbia Pictures to cease its European distribution, fearing its message would damage \"America's prestige in Europe.\"\n\nOutside of the D. C. beltway, however, movie goers loved \"Mr. Smith Goes To Washington.\" The studio sent Kennedy a number of critics' positive reviews that reflected American sentiment showing democracy works within the halls of the U. S. Capitol despite its inherent flaws. When Vichy France later in 1940, under Nazi rule, placed a ban on the movie within 30 days, people lined up for blocks to see Jimmy Stewart, as a wet-behind-the-ears Senator, give his impassioned filibuster speech. One theater in southern France ran the Capra movie nonstop around the clock for that month before shutting down.\n\nInitially, Capra wanted to make a sequel to \"Mr. Deeds Goes To Town,\" with Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur, based on Lewis Foster's unpublished story, 'The Gentleman from Montana.' But Cooper was too busy. Capra turned to Stewart, whom he worked with in 1938's \"You Can't Take It With You,\" as a loan-out from MGM. \"I knew he would make a hell of a Mr. Smith,\" recalled the director. \"He looked like the country kid, the idealist. It was very close to him.\" In the movie, Stewart is picked on a flip of the coin by the governor of a western state to fill in for a recently deceased senator. He figured Jefferson Smith (Stewart), head of the state's Boy Rangers, would be easy to manipulate. Once in D. C., he's taken under the wing of Joseph Paine (Claude Rains), senator friend of Smith's late father. Many feel Senator Paine was based on Missouri Senator Harry S. Truman, known as \"the senator from the Pendergast\" political machine. Paine gets Smith busy on establishing a national boy's camp on federal land by a lake. Trouble is big-time developer, Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold), who has Paine in his pocket, is eyeing that same lake for a massive dam project. Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur), Smith's secretary who knows the inner workings of Congress, educates the new Senator to the realities of the Capitol. Her lessons open the eyes to Smith, who becomes wise to the manipulations of those around him.\n\nCapra was initially hesitant on directing a movie of such a topical nature in the face of global tensions. \"The cancerous tumor of war was growing in the body politic, but our reform-happy hero wanted to call the world's attention to the pimple of graft on its nose,\" wrote Capra after hearing President Roosevelt during a press conference on Europe teetering on the edge of conflict. Capra thought hard about his decision until he visited the sites of Washington, D. C., and walked through the Lincoln Memorial. The director's impressions solidified his determination to make \"Mr. Smith Goes To Washington.\" \"We must make the film if only to hear a boy read Lincoln to his grandpa,\" said Capra on the crucial scene where Smith overhears the grandson reading the Gettysburg address chiseled into the wall of the memorial.\n\nThe biggest expense in \"Mr. Smith Goes To Washington\" was building an exact replica of the Senate chambers on Columbia's lot, built nearly to scale. The former superintendent to the Senate press gallery, James Preston, was hired as technical advisor to oversee its accuracy. Capra's simple request to Preston was, \"I want you to arrange for our crew to come in here and photograph all the details - inkwells, pencils, stationery, everything down to the hole the Union soldier kicked in Jeff Davis' desk the day Jeff walked out to join the Confederacy.\" Filming the filibuster sequence was one of the most complex set-ups Capra had ever tackled. \"How to light, photograph, and record hundreds of scenes on three levels of a deep well, open only at the top, were the logistic nightmares that faced electricians, cameramen, and soundmen,\" Capra wrote. Unusual for a shoot, he employed several cameras to film at the same time, capturing the reactions of every primary actor as Jefferson Smith rambled on his marathon filibuster.\n\nStewart knew this was a role of a lifetime. Jean Arthur recalled how nervous he was during the production, realizing the entire movie rested on his shoulders. \"He was so serious when he was working on that picture,\" Arthur remembered, \"he used to get up at five o'clock in the morning and drive himself to the studio. He was so terrified something was going to happen to him, he wouldn't go faster.\" For the long filibuster scenes, Stewart knew after 23-hours of talking he would have to sound raspy. With the doctor's advice, Stewart said, \"He dropped dichloride of mercury into my throat, not near my vocal chords, but just in around there. It wasn't dangerous. And he said: 'how's that?' I said: 'rasp, rasp'. He said: 'You got it.'\" Capra loved the results, commenting, \"No amount of acting could possibly simulate Jimmy's intense pathetic efforts to speak through real swollen chords.\"\n\n\"Mr. Smith Goes To Washington\" was the second highest box office film for 1939, and saw the third largest ticket sales of the decade, just behind 1939 \"Gone With The Wind\" and 1937 \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\" The Academy nominated Capra's film in eleven categories: Best Picture, Best Director (Capra), Best Actor (Stewart), Best Supporting Actors (Rains and Harry Carey, who played the Vice President presiding over the Senate), Best Screenplay (Sidney Buchman), Best Original Story (Lewis Foster), Best Art Direction, Best Film Editing, Best Music Scoring (Dimitri Tiomkin), and Best Sound Recording. The film won only one Oscar, however, for Best Original Story. The American Film Institute ranks the movie as the 26th Best Movie of All Time, the fifth Most Cheerful Movie, and Jefferson Smith as the 11th Best Hero in film. Senator Joseph Paine was nominated for movie's Worst Villain. Many consider Stewart's performance far better than the one he was awarded for Best Actor in his role as a magazine reporter in 1940's \"The Philadelphia Story.\" The Capra classic is one of '1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die.'"

        "review_title": "An engaging, albeit simplistic, film",
        "review_detailed_main": "Mr. Smith Goes To Washington is an engaging, albeit simplistic, film about the power of determination and the effect one man can have on society. While it is rife with Capra's signature sentimentality and less-than-subtle storytelling methods, it is also very effective. The story is one of a triumph of dogged persistence and idealism over \"the political machine\". It evokes the spirit of Norman Rockwell's \"Freedom of Speech\".\n\nJeff Smith (Jimmy Stewart) is a young, idealistic leader of a boys' group similar to the Boy Scouts, who is chosen, much to his surprise, to be elected senator. He is filled with hope and aspirations of his country's future, seeing his surroundings with wonder and amazement. His only plan - aside from patriotic yet vague hopes - is to pass a bill in Congress allowing for the creation of a national boys' camp. This, of course, earns him favor with boys all across the country, idolizing him and sending him campaign contributions - a nickel at a time. He meets up with his new secretary, the lovely yet callous Clarissa Saunders (usually just \"Saunders\"), played by Jean Arthur, who helps to write and introduce his bill. However, conflicts arise when the proposed land for Smith's camp is the same site as the soon-to-be-proposed Willet Creek Dam. Soon, Smith discovers an aspect of America he never expected - the puppetry of Jim Taylor, an extraordinarily wealthy tycoon who works his way into the innermost workings of Congress.\n\nIn many ways, he represents an ambassador of sorts between the world of boys - filled with adventure, ambition and a certain irrefutable yet candidly simple logic, and the world of politics - filled with cynicism, bribery and self-interest. (in fact, aside from Jefferson Smith, just about every politician in the film is either corrupt or simply very stubborn and foolish). Jimmy Stewart's portrayal of the young senator is so incredibly naive, boyish and filled with blue-eyed wonder far past the point of realism (at one point, he punches several people in the face), yet he manages to retain a certain charm. Saunders notes that when he left for the Senate for, she felt as if she were a mother wishing him well on his first day of school. Without giving away any details, despite the implausibility of the character this is one of Jimmy Stewart's best and most entertaining performances.\n\nHowever, the best performance in the film - beyond any doubt - would have to be Claude Rains's portrayal of Senator Joseph Paine. Paine is a more complex and interesting character than the others, most of whom have rather predictable personalities and story arcs. Paine, once Jefferson Smith's mentor and good friend, is forced to campaign against him. He has been justifying his allowance of the Taylors' influence for years, and despite his basic good nature, he has learned how to play the game of politics. He is a man who at times hates his job, but knows what must do and pursues it with everything he has - and Rains is utterly convincing in the role.\n\nStill, the film is far from perfect. Many of the characters seem simple and hollow - as if they were merely the execution of the story's premise, rather than actual humans in a difficult situation. Much of the film seems incredibly exaggerated and unlikely - particularly what happens to Smith's fanboys toward the end of the film! Capra's basic filmmaking strategy is to bombard the viewer with emotion and inspiring, patriotic monologues.\n\nUltimately, despite its flaws, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is very entertaining. As long as the viewer doesn't take it as seriously as it seems to take itself, (and doesn't mind a barrage of stars and stripes) it is a very enjoyable and significant film."

        "review_title": "Washington Myth",
        "review_detailed_main": "I would be greatly surprised if another film beats Mr. Smith Goes to Washington as my favorite Capra film. It's probably the perfect encapsulation of the combination of Capra's optimism about the promise of America, relying on its traditions, morals, and people to get past its problems along with the cynical take on larger institutions that worked to graft their own extra slice of the American dream while the people weren't paying attention. I recall how American Madness was supposed to be a way to instill confidence in America's banking institutions in the early years of the Great Depression, an effort I didn't actually see, instead witnessing a damnation of the larger banks with someone different offering up hope for the future. Here, we have one Mr. Jefferson Smith doing the same thing.\n\nIn an unnamed Western state, a senator has died, and the powers that be argue about who should be put in its place, at least for the next two months until a special election, especially important since Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold), the hidden power in the state, has steadily organized, with the help of Senator Joe Paine (Claude Rains), a bill to pass through the Senate that would buy up land in the state for a dam that they've all previously purchased under different names. It's going to make them all very rich, and the head of the political machine is going to make sure it goes through. However, the governor (Guy Kibbee) is too skittish in the face of popular opinion against a machine man, so he resorts to following the advice of his children in naming Jefferson Smith (Jimmy Stewart), a political neophyte with a grand reputation, to take the seat and do his bit, as he is told.\n\nWhat I find interesting about these early scenes is the clear-eyed, if seemingly somewhat simplified for dramatic purposes, view of corruption at the state level. It's all-encompassing, and the only thing that can drive a politician to do something right, perhaps, is fear of losing his seat. That cynical take on politics also extends to the federal government, but the film has a tight way of telling its story that seems to imply that corruption is limited rather than pervasive at the federal level, something I attribute to narrative economy concerns more than an actual judgement (at no point does any senator call the graft anything at all either good or bad, it's just glossed over completely). I doubt Capra would be na\u00efve enough to think it was limited, though.\n\nAnyway, Smith is taken to DC and is gobsmacked by the history and feelings of reverence he has in the nation's capital with particular emphasis on Abraham Lincoln and his monument (Capra and Ford seemed to share a similar love of the sixteenth president), and he must be corralled by the bitter and always nearly quitting aide, Saunders (Jean Arthur). She shows him the ropes of Senate business, falls in love with him a little bit, and helps him write his first bill which proposes to use the exact same spot of land for a boy's camp rather than an unnecessary dam. This is the stage that gets set to pit Smith's optimistic view of government of the people, by the people, and for the people up against the cold, cynical take of politics as wealth-generation for the powerful as represented by Taylor.\n\nOne of the character details that I really like in the film is the personal connection between Smith and Paine. Paine doesn't even realize it until Smith explains it to him, but Paine knew Smith's father before he was murdered, shot in the back because he backed a hopeless cause in the state that the powers that be were opposed to (implying that Taylor was behind the murder, which is never explored but just lingers off to the side nicely). This lets Paine revisit his earlier days of optimistic idealism that Smith is living in right then, and it's vitally important for Paine's final moments as Smith's big effort to defeat the dam project through a filibuster. There's a real relationship between Paine and Smith based on personal connection, ideals, and their own interests. The film does have a fairy tale aspect, but the effort to create this little connection between the two men is enough to make it believable, just enough, in my mind.\n\nOf course, the central aspect of its ending is that filibuster, and it's the more perfect exemplification of what, I think, Capra and Riskin had been trying to do in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town. In the earlier film, everything stops for a trial that's largely just a recap of what's happened in the film (until Deeds gets to be witty in his defense), but in the script by Sidney Buchman, Smith gets to exemplify the ideals he's been espousing. The fight is a fight for democratic ideals, of being able to speak and change people's minds, and the filibuster is intimately tied into the rest of the film thematically. Essentially, it works better at integrating theme and action.\n\nThrow in the fact that Smith's idealism is what gets Saunders to fall in love with him, and this is just a really well-done screenplay.\n\nThe comparisons to Mr. Deeds are also worth of more note. First, Mr. Smith was originally conceived of as a sequel to the earlier film with troubles sidelining the project until it became its own thing, but the character of Smith could almost be Deeds in many ways. The two also share many large structural similarities to the point where I wonder if Capra's efforts were just really well-done and unique formula. The innocent man is suddenly thrown into great wealth or power, he tries to adapt to the new world but can't quite fit, and he eventually tries to use his power for good until the established powers try to destroy him. In the earlier film, it was through an effort to declare him insane. In Smith, it's about accusing Smith of exactly what Taylor and Paine are trying to do instead.\n\nI also feel like Stewart is far better cast than Gary Cooper had been in the earlier film. Stewart has that boyish charm that Cooper had long-since dropped as an older man, but he's also got a certain physicality in being able to throw a punch (giving as good as he gets to the Washington press corps). Arthur is a wonderful presence as the cynical woman fighting against herself in this terrible city. Rains and Arthur are just as good in their parts respectively wounded and commanding. I would feel bad for not mentioning Thomas Mitchell as the member of the press who has drunken promises to marry Saunders but gets as caught up with Smith's antics as anyone else.\n\nCapra's clear eye towards composition serves him well once more as he stages all of the action in just the right way to convey meaning. His command with actors is great. His way of telling a story connects so easily and so well. I would be surprised if another film comes along and displaces this as my favorite Capra, but I haven't seen It's a Wonderful Life in a very long time."

If there were no fashion gestures and mimics of that time you could not say that the film is so old. The movie does not miss anything, even not the color. The script is so planned and detailed that every dialogue is important and makes perfect sense. Can you recall of any such film made in color? Camera is pretty much piece of art. The technique of shooting, shot and scene interactions are perfect. Plot is fast, engaging and coherent. Art scenes representing body language mixed with camera angles, light play and contrast are amazing. The one could say that Capra really learned from German expressionists. Although has a high rate on IMDb, this movie remains underrated. A real gem from grandmaster of propaganda film - Frank Capra who here proves his feature film talent."

The powerful Jim Taylor is forced to pull some strings in order to discredit the young senator so that his dam can be built. The Taylor Machine frames Smith, accusing him of fraud. Shamed, Smith is ready to leave Washington behind when his assistant, Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur) inspires him to fight for his ideals just as his forefathers had. Smith returns to congress, armed with a new strategy to accomplish his goal. James Stewart gives one of his finest performances as Jefferson Smith, the young, passionately patriotic Senator confronting corruption in the government he holds so dear.\n\n8/10."
