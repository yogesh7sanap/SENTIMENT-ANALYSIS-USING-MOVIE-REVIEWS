        "review_title": "The masterpiece without a message",
        "review_detailed_main": "One of the early scenes in \"Pulp Fiction\" features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, \"Pulp Fiction\" wouldn't be \"Pulp Fiction.\" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.\n\nIt's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. \"Pulp Fiction,\" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or \"art about art.\" It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.\n\nThe movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.\n\nPerhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, \"Be cool and no one's going to get hurt,\" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren't just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mia's statement to Vincent, \"That's when you know you've found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.\"\n\nWhat is the movie's purpose exactly? I'm not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn't just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because it's a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.\n\nThere's a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butch's act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we're never sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.\n\nStill, it's hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really \"about\" anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn't need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is Tarantino's masterpiece, there's no other way to say it. It has arguably one of the smartest scripts I've ever seen. The story, which is non-linear, is so well constructed it takes several viewings to grasp it all. The movie doesn't seem to be about any spesific thing, but there is a subtle hint of redemption as a central theme. The characters and preformances in this movie are practically perfect. This is still one of the best performances I've seen from Sam Jackson, and it's an outrage he didn't win an Oscar. Each scene has its own unique flavour and charm, every segment has its own arc while also tying into the main plot. The comedy is great, the serious moments are great, every word of dialogue is exciting despite seemingly not having any reason to exist. This movie is just such a great time, and I recommend it to everyone who loves movies. I cannot think of a single genuine flaw with it, and it will remain one of my favorite movies for a long time."

        "review_detailed_main": "I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as stylish, cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone when I first saw it in 1994. What really pulled me in right from the start is what we've now come to know as a Tarantino trademark: the dialogue. When gangsters Jules and Vincent talk to each other (or all the other characters, for that matter) there is a natural flow, a sense of realism and yet something slightly over the top and very theatrical about their lines \u2013 it's a mixture that immediately grabs your attention (even if it's just two dudes talking about what kind of hamburger they prefer, or contemplating the value of a foot-massage). Then there's the music: the songs Tarantino chose for his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of music are now immediately associated with 'Pulp Fiction'. And the narrative: the different story lines that come together, the elegantly used flashbacks, the use of \"chapters\" \u2013 there is so much playful creativity at play here, it's just a pure joy to watch.\n\nIf you're a bit of a film geek, you realize how much knowledge about film and love for the work of other greats \u2013 and inspiration from them - went into this (Leone, DePalma, Scorsese and, of course, dozens of hyper-stylized Asian gangster flicks), but to those accusing Tarantino of copying or even \"stealing\" from other film-makers I can only say: There has never been an artist who adored his kind of art that was NOT inspired or influenced by his favorite artists. And if you watch Tarantino's masterpiece today, it's impossible not to recognize just what a breath of fresh air it was (still is, actually). Somehow, movies - especially gangster films - never looked quite the same after 'Pulp Fiction'. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most sizzling, iconic dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such a crazy, cool, inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it for the first time. It's \u2013 well: it's 'Pulp Fiction'. 10 stars out of 10.\n\nFavorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"

Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will."

However, that doesn't mean I don't appreciate its style. The entire film from the costume design, to the camera work, to the setting of LA are dripping with noir atmosphere. The writing, while it does jerk itself off at times, is still pretty memorable and enjoyable to listen to. The acting is fantastic all around, getting especially good performances from Samuel L Jackson, John Travolta and Bruce Willis.\n\nWhile I don't think its a masterpiece, it is something fun to watch if you're looking for something different and intriguing."

There was definitely a lot of care into the writing of the script, as everything no matter the order it is in, fits with the story. Many mysteries have been left such as what is inside of the briefcase and why Marcellus Wallace has a band-aid on the back of his neck, which may be connected.

Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Christopher Walken. The dialog is surprisingly humorous for this type of film, and I think that's what has made it so successful. Wrongfully denied the many Oscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film of the 90s and no Tarantino film has surpassed the quality of this movie (although Kill Bill came close). As far as I'm concerned this is the top film of all-time and definitely deserves a watch if you haven't seen it."

That's not to say that it isn't good, but I think a lot of people think it is a whole lot better then it is. The film is acted well and I enjoyed all the action, not to mention the comedy in this film caught me by surprise. I found it really hilarious. I see why everyone had/has a crush on Uma Thurman now, she really is deserving of the main character on the cover. I also remembered how much I like long shots. I think they allow exposition to be delivered in a way that is more pleasing to the audience. Overall, good crime flick with some great comedy and action but a tad overrated. 7-8/10."

The characters are very memorable The story of nonlinear dialogue and action no the whole movie is fast and fun there's no down time or anything boring the movie is long. There's more then 10 memorable scenes that is referenced in any type of media. I like to think of pulp fiction as resvoir dogs another film by the genius tarrintino as a better version of it. I thought resvoir dogs had the coffe scene at the start and mr white hurting the police officer. I thought the movie was stretched out more then it needed to and the ending gave me such a poor taste in my mouth. I still like it, like I would get a poster or t shirt of resvoir dogs to show my opinion. There did you see that I lost focus that's what pulp fiction does it makes you forget about the world but remember about the experience. The scene where butch reclaims himself in the eyes of walleces is a redemption story in itself about how we can all get together without fighting and being greedy. The part where 2 scenes ( tiny bit of a spoiler but watch Pulp fiction now if you haven't) where somehow at point blank range a revolver didn't shoot Jules and vincent and somehow Vincent shoots one of the guys in the head on accident. Thats a message life is like a box of chocolates the things you never expect will happen. Another part of the idea is the violence and sex violence plays a big part in this movie these are horrible people that everyone loves when I see this film I feel like it's a LEGO set controlled by tarrintino everything goes together like cause and effect yet while still being random sex is not that big in the film expect for the epic scene where butch remdeems himself and when butch is making out with his girlfriend but that scene was still great because he had to find his watch holy crap. This movie has dialogue lots of it and that's fantastic he is known for dialogue the tarrintino himself said that dialogue is a major component in his films and it shows, other films have such poopy dialogue where all they do is talk about nothing like get on with it. Pulp fiction is the story of 3 as 1 and should be hands down the number 1 film of the millennium ."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie may be the most overrated film of all time, in my opinion. There is no point. It is not particularly funny. It is not particularly thought provoking. It is not some kind of masterpiece. It is, however, well made. Has good acting with a great cast. Is a fun way to divide up the scenes and plots.\n\nI was ready for this movie to end far before it did, because I learned about halfway through that there is just no purpose to it! No meaning! I definitely enjoyed aspects of it and there was some legitimate tension, without question. It all just felt messy. Truly my favorite part of watching pulp fiction were two scenes that I had seen from different memes 100 times before, and never knew where they came from. It was a, \"oh, hey, I recognize this image!\" That was the most joy I got out of this.\n\nBy no means is it a trainwreck, but to be considered such a timeless masterpiece of cinematic glory? Not a chance. I would like to speak to every single person who gives this a 10 and have them explain to me what exactly this film does well, because I feel pretty confident everyone just gets in line and calls it amazing because that is the 'cool' thing to do."

        "review_detailed_main": "The proof of the pudding, they say, is in the eating. The proof of the movie is in the watching. Most of the top 250 IMDb movies have kept me glued to my seat--with this one I found my mind wandering to that jigsaw puzzle I hadn't finished or the possibility of some popcorn. I found I had very little interest in the characters or in what was going on.\n\nI asked myself why. Technically the film is very good. The actors all hit their marks and Samuel L. Jackson is particularly outstanding. I liked Maria de Madeiros also as Bruce Willis' wife Fabienne. The camera work is occasionally interesting, as the long scene where we watch Bruce Willis listen unemotionally to Marsellus go on. Interesting, certainly, but rather pointless.\n\nIndeed, that's the problem: so much of what goes on is pointless. It's a big long shaggy dog story, told by one of those irritating people who can't get the story straight and have to keep going back: \"Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you about that. Well, you know what I was telling you before . . .\" I tried to find some justification for the higgledy-piggledy way in which this story is told. It does result in the best scene being the last one. But if this scene was the point then why not design the script so that the action is seen to be moving toward this goal and cut out everything that happens afterward? In the end I don't think Tarentino knew what story he was telling and that's why so much is so pointless.\n\nThe scenes of Butch attempting to control his temper, of his dilemma whether to help Marsellus, and the final scene in the restaurant are all good and entertaining as far as they go but they don't fall into a coherent framework. And the rest is quite dull.\n\nThe dialogue is not witty or clever although it occasionally has its moments. The constant profanity is as pointless as the rest; the point of profanity is presumably to emphasize what one is saying, but if everything is emphasized, nothing is. The mind becomes numbed by it. It's like someone who shouts all the time. Eventually you stop listening. The quotes give you a pretty good idea of what the dialogue is like: when \"Shut the f*ck up, fat man!\" is listed as a memorable quote, you know how inane the conversation is.\n\nThat this poorly composed script should have won an Oscar is a pretty clear indictment of the Academy."

        "review_detailed_main": "Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a terrific film. It also gets better with each viewing, especially if one of those happens to be on a big theatrical screen where all of the BIG compositions get bigger and more detailed. How much else is there to talk about it after all these years? It's filled with dynamite, sudden and always interesting action, great and naturally clever dialogue, and memorable characters. Also, the acting is always something to behold as by turns straightforward, over the top, subtle, and just downright menacing and spot-on. The directing is one of the strongest that we've seen from Tarantino, as he makes his choices in pacing with shots in unconventional ways but never in a way that would be distracting. And writing, already noted, has been copied by many, and only equaled by a select few.\n\nThe dance sequence. Samuel L. Jackson's superlative monologuing. It has loyalty among low lifes, and many other odd characters that are all bad and not one is a villain or hero. And somehow even after years of parody and terrible rip-offs, it holds its own and- as one can say after seeing it at a midnight screening- holds its audience as much as it had the countless times before they saw it (or if they are, the first time). The first time you're surprised, the second time you look for the clues or other ambiguity, and then the third time you laugh you head off. The fourth time... I'll leave to you."

        "review_detailed_main": "It kind of feels redundant trying to write a review for Pulp Fiction as it approaches its 20th birthday. As a film it needs no introduction, it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, won a BAFTA and Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay (Tarantino), and garnered a whole host of other awards and nominations. Box office beef was meaty and its reputation even now shows no sign of waning (it currently sits at number 4 on the IMDb top 100 list), it is by definition one cool MOFO of a movie, a picture loved by a cross section of demographics. But why?\n\nPulp Fiction oozes humour, romance, violence and stylish flourishes. It remains compulsive viewing throughout; even as it threatens to get submerged in its own complex structure. Film lover Tarantino takes a number of low life and unfortunate characters from Los Angeles, mainlines then with movie clich\u00e9s, and then amazingly breathes new life into them. It knowingly winks at B movies from the past yet always remains fresh on its own terms. I myself having just revisited the film after a 5 year gap can attest to just how well it holds up, laughing at the dialogue, perched on the edge of the seat as violence starts to rumble, and yes, singing along with that most catchy of soundtracks.\n\nYet for all its flashiness and hipster chattering, there's one thing that often gets overlooked when talk of Pulp Fiction's greatness arises. That of a basic human urge to survive or find salvation, Tarantino's main characters may be bottom feeders or scummy operatives of the underworld, but there's love and needing beating slowly in its dark heart before the drugs and violence take a hold. Neat trick that from Tarantino, brilliant in fact. 10/10"

I also really liked the diner scene, the best diner I've ever seen onscreen and just so stunningly beautiful, it truly does look heavenly that place and every happy night I have I dream of going to that diner with a few of my British mates and gently bonding with our lovely American children."

The cinematography is a masterpiece. Tarantino's style makes the audience feel like they're in the movie by the camera movements, and the way the story is told, is also one out of the many unique things about the film. The first time I've seen it, I was so confused on how the story was basically out of order but the more times I watched it, the more I caught onto Tarantino's style and the more I appreciated it. This movie was ahead of its time, and in my opinion considered a masterpiece."

Ploddingly slow too often in an attempt to be arty and edgy, it just exposes the poor writing that the shifted timelines can't save. No investment in characters, or plot. Just a collection of scenes and ideas drowning in a lake of stagnant dialogue and overly long, trite scenes with characters and actions that make no sense. Very disappointing."

Nobody in the film is remotely principled, and nor is anyone (except possibly the pawnbroker) actually evil. The scene where he releases a leather-studded sadist from a cage is possibly the most unbelievable rubbish ever deployed in a Hollywood feature.\n\n\"It's only entertainment,\" I hear people protest. Well the difference between Mr Tarantino and film-makers of stature is that they are capable of entertaining while instructing, and of integrating the two."

There are a lot of great scenes in this movie but the most memorable scene I think was when Uma Thurman and John Travolta are dancing on stage at the restaurant to \" You never can tell\" by Chuck Berry. Another famous and great scene is Samuel L Jacksons speech hes giving to the guy while shooting every one else. A lot of action shots in this film, drugs, guns, and violence.

There is no question that this is a well made and fun movie. However it is not the amazing Second Coming of Christ as many Tarantinophiles would have us all believing. Many of the components are merely there to make us, the audience, gasp in horror or gaze in amazement. Do we REALLY need to watch John Travolta stick a needle in Uma Thurmond? Yeah, sure it was cool at the time but that coolness quickly wears off when you realize there is really nothing likeable about any of these people."

The dialogue is sharp and witty yet feels very realistic for most of the film (occasional monologues aside). The film can make characters seem like total bad-asses just by having them eat food (in this case a burger) and can make you sympathize and care about horrible people. The film is extremely entertaining with no scene feeling like it goes for too long and every moment serving a purpose in the overall narrative.

        "review_detailed_main": "If I may, let me note what a year 1994 was for film. This film. Shawshank. Gump. The Lion King. If someone came up to me and started ranting about how this was the best cinematic year ever, I'd actually listen to them for awhile before asking them why they are getting in my face. Of those films, this and Shawshank stand out, because they were not pre-established blockbusters. Gump and Lion King were expected to be pretty big, and just turned out bigger than anyone could possibly imagine. But these films were smaller, more personal projects. They are also quite different from each other in almost every other way; a notable one being that while Shawshank barely made back its budget at the box office, this film took off. Over the last couple weeks, with Steve Jobs and the like, we have examples of platforming failing. But it can succeed: this film is a prime example of that.\n\nThis is important not just if you're incurably a nut about these sort of things, like am I. It means that this is the first exposure a lot of people had with a Tarantino film. I bet a lot of people became fans for life at some random matin\u00e9e screenings some cloudy Tuesdays. This is one of those films that I would have loved to be there at one of its early screenings. A lot of minds were opened those days.\n\nI hope I'm not overselling this film, but it is one of those films that is so great that it is nearly impossible to oversell, which is a positive for me, as I love my gushing descriptions, as you might be able to tell if you read my review of Mad Max: Fury Road.\n\nOne thing that must be noted about this film is that it goes out of order, and not a semi-organized out of order like Memento. This does not make the film hard to follow- it is easier to follow than Memento, at any rate- but it does make you think on your feet. Sometimes, I think that this whole movie is a then-young Mr. Tarantino taking a hunk of dynamite to the usual three-act structure. And it is glorious. No film better encapsulates the rush of exciting new filmmakers that we had in the 90s than this one.\n\nThe title describes this film so well. It's not based on the style of blockbuster films. This isn't Jaws or Indiana Jones. This is darker, dirtier, less-universally subject matter. This is the equivalent of those books you keep for a trip to the doctor's office or the DMV just so you can be pulled out of the doldrums of life. It's not trying to be one of those Great American Novels written by Fitzgerald or Steinbeck that is typically only read by 'normal people' when they are in an English class or when they feel particularly scholarly.\n\nOf course, most of those novels were not particularly good, even at being what they are. This film is. It's clever, action-packed, well-written, and so much more. It represents a stark change from the happy-go-lucky (sometimes), subtle (often), and averse from breaking new ground (usually) attitudes of eighties movies and holds up a banner for nineties film. In the nineties, the same techniques that were developed for dark and gritty and serious movies like The Godfather or Apocalypse Now were being played apart the fabric of the mainstream. Yes, kids movies got even cheesier and less legit. But they no longer defined the market like they did in the prior decade.\n\nArtistic exploration became the norm. And few did that more than Mr. Tarantino, particularly in this film. Yes, if pulp fiction is what people expected, pulp fiction is what they got. But they did not get it in the way that they expected. To once more go back to MM:FR, I'm willing to be there were people who went into that film expecting to see just another action film in the style of the dime-a-dozen Die Hard and James Bond knock-offs that pop up so often every year. Their experience with that movie is probably on the level as anyone who came into this film expecting to see a mere piece of pulp fiction. This film is not a part of that 'genre', if you can call it that, but both an homage to it and its leading light. It transcends its grounds, its place in time, and perhaps even the medium of film itself. It is pure artistry.\n\nI cannot exaggerate how much of a breath of fresh air this was. Pretty much every problem with film in the eighties was given an antidote. It's also a good cure for everything from with major filmmaking today, though I argue that a more artsy version of the Hunger Games series would be a better one. But that's just me.\n\nAs you might expect from a film that took off like this, it launched several careers and revived others, including that of John Travolta, who for once uses his overacting to his advantage. The soundtrack, of course, is phenomenal and iconic. Enough so that when I wrote the words Pulp Fiction down on the page, the first thing that popped into my mind was the title theme (Misirlou as covered by Dick Dale and the Daletones, in case you were wondering).\n\nAbove all, when I watched this film, I felt a love for film and artistry, as well as a desire to build upon the works of the past while making a unique mark. It enraptures you in itself. Honestly, I'm kinda surprised that it took off like it did back then. But I'm not surprised that it's remembered today. It holds a unique place in society and is one of the definitive 90s films. Enjoy."

        "review_detailed_main": "The postmodern discourse of the film, because it is in the post-industrial society era, is driven by the commercialization of the consumer society, thus embodying commercial, game, and popular colors. Jameson pointed out that the old (essentially advanced modernist) boundary between the advanced culture and the so-called popular culture or business culture has been abolished, and new texts have emerged that are full of forms, categories and contents of cultural industries. Bourdieu believes that the film has got rid of the shackles of classic art and has become a popular culture or a postmodern culture and has become a cultural capital. The purity of aesthetics and the self-discipline of art have been impacted. The tower of pure aesthetic ivory has collapsed under the impact of popular art and its aesthetics. The ensuing is the appearance of popular aesthetics, and it has increasingly gained its own aesthetic legitimacy. Attracting audiences with popular themes, flattening the depth, everything is flat, this is what distinguishes the serious attitude of postmodernism from modernism. The result is to give the audience leisure, fashion, relaxation, surprise, and no tears. Violence, crime, sex and other generally considered vulgar themes are the themes of postmodern movies. Especially in terms of violent style, Tarantino became a single family. Violence has always been the unshakable theme of Quentin's works, and formed his black violence aesthetics. Violence is bloody, cold, game, and does not carry any moral and political responsibilities. \"Pulp Fiction\" thoroughly stylized and gamified violence. It makes the audience realize that at this moment, you are watching movies for entertainment, so Tarentino will turn violence into joke, sex into joke, politics into joke, and history into joke. It does not ask about the meaning, does not reflect, does not touch politics, not to mention resistance. The \"Bible\" quotes before Jules' killing were not intended to legitimize his murder. Similarly, the scene of Mia's overdose did not have any intention of exhorting drug addicts. \"Black\" has also been treated as a piece of joke. Both Vincent and Jules drove around the city in a car full of brains and blood. In order not to let the police find it, but also in order not to add trouble to their friends, they had to do it within 40 minutes. Cleaning the car is a very technical task, so that they have to hire a special problem-solving expert from the headquarters to guide them in their work. When the two big-hearted men finally washed themselves and the car Afterwards, while wearing two exaggerated and somewhat funny T-shirts standing in front of the camera, a scene full of blood and terror was transformed into a humorous sketch, and the popularity and gameplay are most vividly displayed here. So some people say: \"Pulp Fiction\" completed the transformation of violent movies from modernity to post-modernity, showing that post-modern violent movies have completely lost the power of social criticism, the depth and the profound connection between old movies and the real world. No longer carries the meaning of cultural symbols such as national mythology, heroism, social resistance, political complaints, etc. Some other similar cultural commitments are also taken out, leaving only the image itself. \"And the frequent scenes of violence in the film are echoing Its \"circular structure\" clearly states that the occurrence of violence is cyclical and never stops. \"Pulp Fiction\" tells us: In life, violence, including wars and boxing, is omnipresent. There is no justice in life and death, right or wrong in front of it. Although Quentin Tarantino has never talked about postmodernism, he knows its essence. He seems to tell us that life in the 20th century is developing rapidly, changing fast and worthless. No one is immune. No matter whether life or death is unreasonable and fair Is a \"vulgar novel\", and this is where the subversive power of postmodern cinema aesthetics lies."

The cinematography and scenery are spellbinding, and the soundtrack is brilliant, one of the best soundtracks in a Tarantino film actually. The plot is every bit as compelling as that for Reservoir Dogs, while the dialogue is endlessly quotable and quite hard-boiled. The direction is superb, as are the performances. As excellent as Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis and Christopher Walken are, the film's best actors are John Travolta and Samuel L.Jackson who are unforgettable. Pulp Fiction also has a wealth of characters and crossplots that is really quite astonishing. All in all, brilliant. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

I'm even feeling strange to call it a film. It has no story, no feelings, no plot, no music - just 4 different scenes of disgusting, violent, abusive, offending and racist content put together in a mixed sequence.\n\nHow this crap scores a 9 on IMDb is beyond me. Sometimes when people see a 9 they automatically deceive themselves into believing this is a masterpiece and that maybe if they didn't like it, something is wrong with their opinion or taste. Nothing's wrong. It's a bad movie from beginning to end. The problem is that sometimes Hollywood movies are over-hyped for business reasons like what happened in Titanic and Avatar which by the way were \"OK\" movies but didn't deserve the huge credit they received.\n\nI gave this a 1 because Samuel L. Jackson was the only thing interesting in this disaster. I'm not going to tell those of you that haven't seen it not to, you have to go through the experience on your own and make your fare judgment. Don't listen to anyone's opinion - especially the ones that think if you love this one, then you're COOL!"

Vincent has lived in Amsterdam for three years and is assigned with Jules to retrieve a suitcase that belongs to their boss. There is a shootout and Vincent and Jules do not die because the shots of one gangster fails the target. Jules believes that God's hand has interfered in the bullets and he decides to redeem himself from his life of gangster. Vincent is assigned by Marsellus to go out with his wife Mia (Uma Thurman)while he is traveling and he is scared when she has an OD. Marsellus pays the boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to lose his fight on the fifth round, but Butch wins the fight. He flees from Marsellus and his gangsters but his girlfriend Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros) forgets to bring his golden watch that belongs to his family for many generations. Butch returns to his apartment and he faces Vincent first and Marsellus later. But an incident with sadistic perverts brings Marsellus and Butch side by side.\n\n\"Pulp Fiction\" is one of my favorite movies ever. I had seen this movie for the last time on 11 January 2002 and today I have just watched it again. When we compare the nominations for Best Picture in the 1995 Oscar (\"Pulp Fiction\", \"The Shawshank Redemption\" and the winner and weakest \"Forrest Gump\") with the movies nominated this year we can see that the Oscar winners are not necessarily the best movies of the cinema history. \"Pump Fiction\" saved the career of John Travolta that was in the ostracism and put on the spot Quentin Tarantino after the cult \"Reservoir Dogs\". The complex screenplay with four entwined story has shown to the world the brilliance of Quentin Tarantino. My vote is ten.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Pulp Fiction \u2013 Tempo de Viol\u00eancia\" (\"Pulp Fiction: Time of Violence\")"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a tour de force of brilliantly precise screen writing, perfect acting, precise camera-work, perfect directing and world class dialogue writing. 'Pulp Fiction' is Tarantino's carnival of funny, but equally abrasive nihilism. This is a film which has a surprisingly firm backbone of morality beneath the crazy and deranged surface. Tarantino is constantly on the lookout for characters who make a choice to turn their back on their meaningless lives of nihilistic violence and look for honour and a purpose. The characters who make that choice are allowed to ride off into the sunset, while the characters who decide to not change and stick to their meaningless cyclical lives of never-ending crime and violence are burdened with unenviable fates. There is a method to the madness. Tarantino makes the film and the characters infinitely rich. However while doing all this, he never stops having fun. There are endless film references, pop culture references and other stuff that signifies the film's self- consciousness which constantly make the viewer feel the fact that they are watching a film, a piece of fiction through Tarantino's eyes and not anything attached to reality.\n\nSome people tend to trivialise the structure of the screenplay by calling it a gimmick. But as far as I'm concerned the structure of the screenplay is essential and indispensable in the context of the narrative and in the context of how Tarantino wants to drive home the themes that he is exploring. In a nutshell........ yeah, 'Pulp Fiction' is a masterpiece, it's a bad mother#*%@er."

        "review_detailed_main": "Going into this for the first time, I knew this would be a good movie and I would enjoy it. However, I had no idea that it would be this good. It practically blew me away.\n\nThis movie follows how 6 people's lives are all intertwined in an action packed tale of gun violence, drug-use, and murder.\n\nWhat this film is most famous for is its twisted timeline which is never too confusing but also very impressive. When I first saw the beginning, I didn't think much of it and as the film progressed, I forgot about it. But when it comes back at the ending, I knew I was in for a treat. The movie has several of these surprises which will knock you out cold and they are made brilliant by its twisting plot. I was in awe when the credits first started to roll.\n\nAlso, this movie has an outstanding soundtrack which is actually pretty recognizable and iconic. It is also very well-done too. I honestly feel that it perfectly fits the movie. Like Jaws, when I think of this movie, the soundtrack which played during the end credits instantly plays in my head. It may not be as iconic as Jaws's music but it definitely is of equal quality.\n\nAlso, the acting couldn't be much better. In my opinion, John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, and Bruce Willis all gave perfect performances. They are all able to convey so many moods at once with their facial expressions and they couldn't do any better.\n\nThis movie also has very great repeat watchability to it. The first viewing of this masterpiece is unforgettable. But just like Fight Club, this movie gets better and better every time you watch it. Mainly because the fact that you know what's going to happen and that you know all of its surprises, makes several scenes even more engaging. Also, this movie has so many iconic lines and scenes. It's super rare for a film to have 2 iconic scenes but this movie has several of them which have been retold and parodied so many times in pop culture.\n\nSo in conclusion, this movie is in fact a masterpiece because of many reasons. It has changed cinema so much and it has shown the test of time for over 20 years. I think that this film is going to be remembered for many more decades also. I think that this is Tarantino's best film and I also think that it is one of the best movies ever made. I recommend this to everyone who enjoys action and complex plot structures to movies."

Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most quotable dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such a crazy, cool, fun ride that you feel stoned/dizzy/drunk after watching it eachtime.

        "review_detailed_main": "Quentin Tarantino demonstrated to the world the powerful ingenuity he possesses, and of which he boasts in every minute of this one, his best film, of 2 and a half hours of duration. The real magic of the film is that its viewing is short and leaves you wanting even more, despite its length. Another particularly attractive aspect is its black humour and ordinary situations. Everything is incredible in Pulp Fiction, but without a doubt the most charismatic thing of all is its script, dividing the facts into chapters that were later imitated in other films by other directors and repeated with other films such as \"Kill Bill\". These chapters are not even exposed in a chronological order, which forces the viewer to fit the pieces of the plot, which would be difficult to describe. The next strong point is the very famous cast with brilliant performances that raise the quality of the film to unattainable levels. In particular I want to express my admiration for John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson in their roles as thugs/collectors (Vincent Vega and Jules, respectively) with unforgettable dialogues and discussions that are present almost at all times in their joint performance. Another ingredient magnificently introduced is his soundtrack, with great themes, besides the mythical title song, including pop, rock and soul themes (I find especially elegant Travolta's dance song with Uma Thurman, by Chuck Berry). In short, I can only say that I find no fault with this film and that I do not bring anything new that anyone already knows about this work. Unless Tarantino does something of this magnitude again, this is one of my favorite movies of all time\n\n10/10"

With all of the films that follow a formula, it's good to see one that's essentially a puzzle you have to piece together. Each of the characters have some way of bumping into each other. As a departure from the grave tone of his first film, the indie hit Reservoir Dogs, this started Tarantino's signature style of excessively gory dark comedies with humorous observational dialogue.\n\nThis film is bizarre, has some tense frantic moments, will make you laugh and is overall unlike any other film out there. It's biggest advantage, aside from Samuel Jackson and John Travolta having philosophical discussions about hamburgers, is the fact that it's volatile and it's completely impossible to predict what's next. This was a benchmark movie and, in some ways, a paradigm shift for the industry."

This film has insights looking both backward and forward ... a reel show of American ideology that alludes to foreign infiltration of the system.\n\nHow can one not love Pulp Fiction? From one of America's most controversial film directors who does not shy away or shudder in fear, a man who tackles complex thematic material head on, in overt gritty chains... and has managed to unchain the bleeding heart flicker by flicker."

I suppose I was expecting something along the lines of \"Rashomon,\" which was probably setting my expectations too high. There are three story lines (two and a half really--the Tim Roth-Amanda Plummer story is not sufficiently developed), only one of which is really interesting: the final story, revolving around Bruce Willis. And that story takes up maybe one-quarter of the movie. The remainder is filled with the John Travolta-Uma Thurman story line, which would have been interesting in the hands of a more talented writer or director than Tarantino. The most interesting character is Keitel's--a great movie could be made of him, but he is on screen for only about ten minutes. Tarantino does a nice job of exploring the \"banality of evil, but the \"hard-boiled\" dialogue is more often artificial and embarrassing, and when he runs out of expletives, he resorts to violence. As for the multiple story line concept, it's wasted here. Tarantino actually did a better job with interweaving multiple story lines in \"Reservoir Dogs\" (another flawed film, but for different reasons). And regarding what's in the briefcase--ultimately, who cares?"

It was unpleasant, filled with scumbag people I cared nothing about, doing godawful things to each other with horrendously graphic visuals and appalling dialogue. It jumped around in time, circling back to where it opened, but from another viewpoint, and while that may be some sort of artsy crafting in editing or storytelling, it doesn't save it from the fact that it was just plain revolting.\n\nWhen the characters could get away for a second from m-f-ing all over the place, there *was* some interesting verbal exchange... bright and witty and even vaguely profound, but Kafka it ain't. I have to say, I thought all the performances were incredible, esp Samuel Jackson, but can't Quentin Tarantino stay OUT of any of his own films?! Even playing a 'nicer' guy, he comes off as a borderline psycho. I thought it was *very* interesting, tho, to see Chicago Hope's Eric Stoltz in there as a drug dealer.\n\nI worry about people's minds, if this is what they think of as a great movie. EEK! A movie about redemption? Gee... I didn't see any of that. If perhaps a character got out of the violent melee alive, I'd hardly call that 'redemption', if they are hardly anyone worth caring about being redeemed in the first place. An earthquake fault could have opened up and swallowed the lot of 'em, and I would have applauded. People think it's really cool or trendy to give accolades to trash nowadays.\n\nTime to get some mouthwash for my eyes, and get the stench out of 'em."

Kubrick had 2001, Scorsese will have Goodfellas and Tarantino, well, he'll have Pulp Fiction.\n\nI watched this film on release, when all we really knew about Tarantino was Reservoir Dogs. It's hard for me to think what someone viewing it more than a quarter of a century later would make of it. Hopefully it can be viewed in context and see how revolutionary the film really was.\n\nOne striking thing, which was quite novel at the time, is how the scenes aren't shown chronologically. What at first seems like a gimmick makes more and more sense as the film progresses and on repeat viewings. The impact of the storytelling would have been nowhere near as great if told in a more traditional way.\n\nIf you're new to Tarantino then lucky you, you've got some great movies to watch. You won't go wrong by starting with Pulp Fiction."

Not many films, threatened to change the rules of the game, as this film did. In terms of writing, it's non-linear, now non-linear in the real sense, it does not have a proper line of scenes or proper interpretation either, but they are connected by characters. This film has some iconic scenes which you will never forget. Like that, adrenalin shot scene to Mia (Uma Thurman) or reciting Bible's Eziekel 25:17 by Jules (Samuel Jackson).\n\nThough, it's nearly 2 and hours, its not long and seems short as they are many questions unanswered. So, is Vincent dead or not? What is there in that briefcase to Marseilles? And these are left unanswered. With just 7 scenes, you make a 2 and half hour movie that redefines in it's own way the perspective of the audience. So, I am amazed more than anything even as I watch it for nearly 10th time and the surprise keeps coming each time I see this. There is something that always works in PULP FICTION. But, what makes this film work is it's writing. It's writing like madness, there is no proper thing called this is it. It can be referred to anything and you may be right. The righteous man and the evil man interpretation is just a tiny example that can be taken out for how we can interpret a character.\n\nIf I want to write one favourite scene here, it's gonna be the whole movie coz I like everything in it. Technically, I like the cinematography, sound design and costumes. But above all, I liked performances and dialogues.\n\nThanks to Quentin who has given us more memorable movies in the last 20 years that are far superior in writing than anyone else. But for me, this is is my favourite Quentin film and I will stick with this till he out performs himself by writing something much more weird than this.\n\nA sure 5/5 for one of my favourite films, no less ever."

And Vincent was also shaped in different angles and details. In the movie, he is a man of humer, a good partner, and the spot in this movie which is dramatic when he killed by Butch. The movie was full of black humer and it might wants to say, nobody would be the 'righteous man' in the world of violence, but their character is vividly brought to your attention by Quentin, which makes up this high-scoring movie"

Pulp Fiction may be the single best film ever made, and quite appropriately it is by one of the most creative directors of all time, Quentin Tarantino. This movie is amazing from the beginning definition of pulp to the end credits and boasts one of the best casts ever assembled with the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Christopher Walken. The movie redefined the action genre and reinvigorated the careers of both John Travolta and Bruce Willis. This movie is required viewing for any fan of film."

It had excellent performances, some good action scenes, an impressive structure and fantastic sound track. When Pulp Fiction came out in my country in October 1994, i could not wait to see it. Empire Magazine gave it 5 stars. I remember when i went up to Glasgow to see it with an anticipation i had not felt since i had went to see some thing like Star Wars or Indiana Jones.\n\nOh boy, twenty minutes in and i was already sick to death of Samuel Jackson's character. He just talked and talked and talked and....talked. John Travolta's Vince Vega was a guy i wanted to decimate, oh Travolta you looked ridiculous with those hair extensions and then you talked and talked and talked with Uma Thurman in a silly black wig. There was so much talking in this film that it made me want to walk out. I have only ever done this once in my life and it was with that utter garbage Jack Nicholson flick Wolf. Tosh.\n\nSo i kept hoping that something good would happen...Christopher Walken as an army bloke talking and talking about a gold watch up his ass...NOT GOOD...a male rape scene with talk...NOT GOOD...Quentin Tarintino turning up in a cameo that should have got him shot (in real life) talk talk about disposing of bodies...oh, this film was the pits, i must have been the only one in the audience that hated this film, because everyone was whooping and hollering like they were watching a Naked Gun comedy. Oh yes, they loved it.\n\nQuiet frankly my admiration of Tarintino was gone forever, he got his head together with the brilliant Jackie Brown then lost the plot again with the silly Kill Bill volumes. Pulp Fiction is one of the worst movies I've ever had to endure, its a long boring ride to a sore head."

They all have stories that are seemingly unrelated but come together subtly through their lives intertwining. It's masterful cinematic story telling, holding buckets of style while also making time to explore its characters and delve into their personalities underneath the crime plot lines. The dialogue is insanely good and the lyrical flow of it keeps you enthralled throughout. I remember when I was a young kid fascinated by the grown up world of Tarantino's films. My fantastic mother let me watch all of his catalogue apart from this one until I was older (due to the distressing gimp rape scene) and there was so much built up for when I became of age to finally watch this masterpiece. It certainly didn't disappoint and it was my favourite QT picture to date. It's rightly become a huge staple in pop culture while also maintaining serious rewatchability and classic status.

        "review_detailed_main": "I just finished watching Pulp Fiction\n\nTarantino nails his screenplay again. This type of talent is not taught at a screenwriting class. You either have it or you do not. Sadly too many people are making movies today, who do not have it, and there are too few talents like Tarantino.\n\nToo many movies these days just seem to say things to advance the plot. The dialogue here is genius, brilliantly funny (you laugh at the dialogue, even though he does not seem to be going for a laugh) and no two characters sound the same, everyone has their own way of talking. I'm appreciating the dialogue so much more watching them again.\n\nI think this was the first time I watched a movie that was so non linear. I think everything I had watched before this went from A to B with possibly a flashback explaining something. This changed everything!! After this we had great movies like The Usual Suspects and Monento. But it is not just the structure to Pulp Fiction that makes it great, it does not put a foot wrong.\n\nWhilst this movie revived John Travolta's career, it's Samuel L Jackson who steals the show. Every time I watch the movie I think he should have won the Oscar. Then I watch Ed Wood, and think Martin Landau deserved it. My opinion on this one, really comes down to which of the two movies I last watched.\n\nHarvey Kieren (in his second Tarantino flick) is great as Winston Wolf (I really wish he did not parody this role in tv ads) Tim Roth (also in his second Tarantino flick) and Amanda Plummer fun and I can not believe I never noticed it was Steve Buscemi (also in his second Tarantino flick) as the waiter Buddy Holly at Jack Rabbit Slim's.\n\nPulp Fiction was a massive hit. It grossed $107 million (against an $8 million budget) At the domestic box office to end the year, as the 10th highest grossing movie of the year."

        "review_title": "Quentin Tarantino's second strike.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Quentin Tarantino's \"Pulp Fiction\" is the quintessential example of great movie making, assorted using various constructive techniques that elevate the film to the highest possible level, stretching the boundaries and pushing upwards. Like all great directors, Q.T. lets the film and its subsidiaries stand on their own. A lesser director might employ cheap gimmicks and plot devices to move the story onwards at a brisk pace, but \"Pulp Fiction\" is a dark action, comedy, and/or drama that clocks in at two hours and thirty-four minutes. And not a single minute is wasted on material we think could have been shortened or cut. It's one of those rare motion pictures that leaves you wanting more, which only welcomes another immediate viewing to let everything sink in a second, third, or even fourth time.\n\nA lesser director than Tarantino might also force his characters into saying things they would not normally say, or into actions they would not normally act out in real life. Instead, Tarantino does something brilliant and seldom executed: He actually lets his characters evolve on-screen, and actually engage in every day conversations. Most critics interpret this as Quentin stopping to insert unnecessary (albeit entertaining) dialogue segments. They're wrong. The dialogue is strong, but it's there for a purpose. The difference is that dialogue in a movie such as \"The Presidio\" isn't real at all. The characters enter, move the plot forwards through speaking or acting, then proceed to repeat this in following instances, as if they're following the back of a mouth wash bottle (\"rinse, spit, repeat\"). Quentin does something else, by eavesdropping on his characters when their dialogue does mean something. No doubt Jules and Vincent have much to say about many things, but most of the time it is not relevant to the story. One must keep in mind that we actually hear little about Jules and Vincent, and even less talk between them. But when we do hear these things, it's strikingly true and purposeful. And this is what so many people miss when viewing \"Pulp Fiction\" -- the witty dialogue has become universally regarded as the strongest ever written, and while that may very well be correct, the idea that it is pointless is absurd. Quentin is subtle in the way he introduces his speeches; when Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta) spend some two or three minutes discussing how the French translate the term \"Quarter Pounder with Cheese\" due to the metric system, it is amazingly deliberate: Quentin later uses this same reference for Jules before he and Vincent assassinate a group of young crooks who have stolen a briefcase from Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), one of the town's major kingpins.\n\nThere are essentially three stories in \"Pulp Fiction,\" intertwined between one another. It opens with Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) and her boyfriend (Tim Roth) hatching a plan to rob a restaurant. By their reasoning, no one ever bothers with restaurants, just banks, so why not take advantage of them \"with their pants down\"? The stick-up proceeds, which is when the famous titles roar forward and we find ourselves following Jules and Vincent, who work for Marsellus, who has paid championship boxer Butch (Bruce Willis) to fall in his upcoming match. But Butch has a better plan: Bet loads of money on himself, beat the other guy to a bloody pulp, and run away with his money. He almost gets away with it when he accidentally crosses paths with Marsellus once more, resulting in a rape scene to rival that in \"Deliverance.\"\n\nBack to the dialogue. It is the driving force of the film, complementing the plot and allowing its characters to grow on us in ways we never imagined they would. It's the way in which the dialogue is deliberated that varies from most other examples of deliberation. For example, is it coincidence that we just so happen to overhear Jules and Vincent discussing the Big Mac and Quarter Pounder with Cheese? No. But our instincts tell us that it seems very real, as if Tarantino went around filming real people, then edited together scenes where the dialogue could bear some sort of importance to the plot. There are different levels of dialogue -- plot-driven, and realistic -- but all dialogue is in service of its plot, just as all of what we say to our friends or family has a deeper meaning and will no doubt relate to the matter at hand. All dialogue relates to a larger scheme, and so does the dialogue in \"Pulp Fiction.\" It's just more casual and subtle than most movies. It's not pointless, but it's not deliberate, which is a fine line to try and balance on. Quentin does so successfully, crossing the finish line with enthusiasm, which is no doubt part of what elevates \"Pulp Fiction\" above so many other motion pictures of its genre.\n\n5/5."

        "review_detailed_main": "Pulp Fiction is a terrific movie! It has all the characteristics of a perfect movie: engaging plot, memorable characters, excellent writing and directing, and awesome music! Tarantino is without a doubt one of the best film-makers of all time. I love all of his movies and I never get tired of watching any of them! Pulp Fiction is just another example of how awesome Tarantino is as a film-maker.\n\nPulp Fiction is one of those movies that requires a second viewing or more to truly understand it and enjoy it more. Not only does it get better with each viewing but it also becomes easier to understand as you notice how Tarantino focuses on the small details of the film and how the small details relate to the main plot. For example: the connection between Marsellus Wallace's Band-Aid on his neck and the suitcase.\n\nThere is a fan theory that says that Marsellus sold his soul to the devil and his soul is inside the suitcase. The fan theory states that in order the extract a soul, it has to come from the back of the neck thus explaining the Band-Aid on Wallace's neck. Tarantino has not come out and proved that theory true or not. Personally, I think Tarantino ultimately led the guessing to the fans as they come up with possible outcomes. The acting and dialogue is over the top and straight forward and I couldn't have possibly thought of a better cast to play the characters.\n\nWhen the film was nominated for all of those Academy Awards in '94, there was very tough competition since other films like Forrest Gump and The Shawshank Redemption were also nominated. But I won't complain since those 2 movies are really good too. However, I believe Pulp Fiction deserved the Oscar for Best Original Script and I'm really glad it won! In conclusion, Pulp Fiction is a cinematic masterpiece that will forever be a highly significant film even after all these years."

What a hopeless bunch of freaks. I don't jump on the \"freak bandwagon\" unless they're natural ones, not arrogant embodiments of deranged entertainment. The glorification of smut is worse than the smut, and that is exactly what this movie is. The sad thing is, I don't believe that some of these actors were acting at all. They were just being themselves. Travolta and Jackson in wigs??? That was scary! The only interesting thing about the movie was the sequence of events. I like the way that it started at one point and ended in the same, but dislike everything in between. The problem with this film is that it tricks the audience into giving it great reviews. It uses the \"peer pressure\" method. You know, \"this movie is for intelligent and cool people\" CRAP!! Well, I'll gladly stand among those who know that this was nothing more than a \"shock flick\". It was produced to see if the letter could be pushed a little further. Unfortunately, it drags what little respect that Hollywood has with it.

        "review_title": "I Am Completely Baffled By Some of The Reviews. Just Shows a Lack of Understanding of the Film More Than Anything",
        "review_detailed_main": "Seriously, what is with all of the one star ratings on this film? What a disgrace. What the people HATED about this movie is exactly what makes it good. So many people complain there is no storyline. Bullshit. If you were actually paying attention to the film you would find that this picture was divided into different segments and switched around. Just because it's something different than what you're used to doesn't mean it's bad. It's called a \"non parallel plot.\" Famous authors and filmmakers do this all the time, you just may have not noticed. Quentin Tarantino just takes it to another level because he has a very unique style where he likes to give you major cliffhangers and start the next substory, making you crave for more (an you do get it, just later on.) If anything, its a series of several stories, and the film is edited the way it is to show how these different stories intertwine. It's not that complicated of a concept, but the low intelligence of many viewers may result in complete confusion of what's going on.\n\nFlat characters? I really don't even need to get into this one. The characters all had their own distinct personalities AND YES, character development. If Jules' transition from crime in the beginning to wanting to get out of the business in the end isn't character development, then I don't know what is. There is an obvious misconception here of what character development actually is.\n\nAnd too much dialogue? That's Tarantino's style. What's with this sudden rule that a film should always be visually told and not told verbally? Bullshit. Art is something like a free for all. It works here. The dialogue is natural and is witty.\n\nI heard one reviewer say Tarantino is self indulgent here because his dialogue represents his thoughts too much. WTF? Just because he has a wordy script style means he's too self indulgent? He's simply writing a script with witty dialogue, there is no ego trip here. This claim is simply and utterly ridiculous. And if you're complaining about him being in his own movies, go ahead and say that Alfred Hitchcock was self indulgent and a bad filmmaker. I am very sure many people here wouldn't dare claim that.\n\nOverall, this is indeed one of the greatest films ever made. And that isn't because it's a fad film like many others say. \"Pulp Fiction\" is a film that has completely revolutionized the way film handles dialogue and the editing of a film's story. If people are unable to acknowledge that then they are only limiting their perception of what has made films evolve to what it is today. Films like \"Pulp Fiction,\" \"A Clockwork Orange,\" \"2001 A Space Odyssey,\" \"Psycho,\" \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,\" etc., are all films with this kind of status. If you don't enjoy this film, then that is fine. However, to deny the importance or influence this film has graced upon the medium is simply foolish and unenlightened on the part of the viewer.\n\nThis is simply one of the most entertaining films you will ever see in your life if you can keep up with the pace and the story. It may take a few viewings if you're the kind of person that can't understand this kind of plot, but I guarantee almost every time that if you watch this film over and over and study it like I have and numerous other classics, you will notice all of the big and little things that make this film what it is. It's truly a remarkable film. There may be little symbolism beside's Jules' commentary on the bible and reciting of biblical passages, but this film is more so about the entertainment than symbolic storytelling. There are two different kinds of films in that way, the ones that try to allude to something symbolic or important like \"A Clockwork Orange\" and there are other films that rely on entertaining the viewer like this film and \"Jaws.\" I'm sure not many people will call \"Jaws\" a bad film either.\n\nAnyway, don't listen to the one star reviewers. They simply didn't understand the film, its story, or its style. This film is a real treat."

        "review_title": "What Is Crazy Anyway?",
        "review_detailed_main": "There isn't a single normal person in Pulp Fiction. Not a one. And that is what makes the film so memorable. There a ton of things going on, including a bizarre couple robbing a diner, a couple of hit men avenging a rip off of a mobster boss, a boxer who is supposed to take a dive but doesn't, and a mobster's wife being entertained by one of the hit men.\n\nI admit it. I saw Pulp Fiction for the first time a couple of nights ago. Why it took me 17 years to see this very special movie is known only to God. To think I could have spent all these years seeing this movie countless times, like I do The Godfather, Casino, GoodFellas, and Love Actually is a bit disappointing. But at least I've seen it now, and now I understand what all the fuss has been all these years.\n\nJohn Travolta made his comeback with his performance as one of the loopy hit men, and deservedly so. He is off kilter enough to be interesting but not so extreme as to be insane. He just kills in his worldly sort of way. Samuel L. Jackson, a killer who obsesses about sin and absolution, is his partner. Uma Thurman is the mobster's wife who Travolta's character is supposed to entertain. Take a look at Steve Buscemi as their waiter.\n\nDirected brilliantly by Quentin Tarantino, all of the performances are memorable. The list of stars who shine in this movie are as endless as the subplots that they play in; Ms. Thurman, Messers Travolta and Jackson, Bruce Willis, Christopher Walken, Ving Rhames, Eric Stoltz, and Harvey Keitel. Keitel's ability to play twisted in such a straight sort of way is astonishing.\n\nThe dialog in this film is classic, as I was warned it would be. I was enthralled with the well crafted dialog that comes out of the actors so seemingly effortlessly, and with such entertaining effect.\n\nEveryone who sees this film will interpret its meaning differently, especially the ending. As for me, I will never use the bathroom when I am supposed to be knocking off a double crossing boxer.\n\nAnd remember, \"Just because you are a character doesn't mean you have character.\""

This time It was a totally different experience, it was like it all came together. I have loved the movie ever since, and I must have seen over 10 times now. The acting is sublime. The story is awesome. The dialog is captivating. This movie sat Quentin Tarantino's name stone as one of, if not the best director of all times. Not only this one but pretty much all of his movies is a treat for the eyes and ears. It's A must see movie!"

Its hodgepodge of violence, mayhem, and generally deviant behavior is an assault on the senses, not to mention political correctness. However, despite all the film's cleverness and style, it hinges on the performance put forth by Samuel L. Jackson as Jules. The fact that he was denied an Oscar is a downright shame. Martin Landau, the best supporting actor winner that year, was terrific and funny in Ed Wood, but Jackson was perhaps the most commanding screen presence in film history as the bible-quoting, godfearing hit-man. The last scene in the coffee shop with Tim Roth still sends chills down my spine, no matter how many times I've seen it. Rumors of a prequel involving Jules and Vincent (John Travolta) have been floating around lately. If Quentin Tarantino wishes to regain the fans he lost with the disappointing (but still pretty good) Jackie Brown, he should get to work right away. I'll be the first in line to see the finished product"

It features such entrancing scenes as countless murders, S&M rape, drug overdose, and other fun things to watch (it's a wonder Six Flags hasn't opened a thrill ride to capture the whole experience). It features all manner of completely unredemptive characters doing cruel, inhuman, or brutal things to each other. Is this entertainment?\n\nThe last straw for me was when a young man was accidentally shot dead by our irascible heroes-- the big problem posed by this is 'how will we clean out the car?' What can you say about someone who views human life so cheaply (hit men or no)? What can you say about someone who finds such spectacle to be entertainment?\n\nThe characters here are completely dehumanized, uncaring about the horrors they inflict on one another, and ironically, much of the audience must be equally dehumanized to accept these characters as the 'good guys.' If Tarantino is the genius this film led people to believe, that would have to be his point, wouldn't it--that to enjoy this movie you would have to be, in some way, sick?"

        "review_detailed_main": "Relatively close to the beginning of my deep-dive into cinema - you know, writing reviews and all - Quentin Tarantino managed to become one of my favorites almost instantly. Reservoir Dogs, Inglorious Basterds, Django Unchained - all of these really blew me away, and even when watching some of his still-popular-but-not-as-much films, he never missed for me. Needless to say that for several years now I've been wanting to watch this movie, but I haven't, because I wanted to make my way towards it up the IMDb poster. And well, look at that. Here we are, on the second feature we're watching from the top 10. Let's get to it.\n\nPulp Fiction is Tarantino's second film, and it's honestly quite a tough one to explain, plot-wise, without getting into spoilers. Let's try to approach it like this: Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) is a ruthless, cold-blooded mafia boss. Throughout the film we have three stories, each of them related to his shady business. Our three main characters are Vincent Vega (John Travolta) - a smooth, charming agent under Wallace, Butch (Bruce Willis) - a boxer who has made a dangerous deal with Wallace, and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) - a theatrical, dramatic agent of Wallace who operates alongside Vincent in some of their tasks. Three characters, three interconnected stories.\n\nWhen people think of cool cinema, many of them think of Tarantino, and especially this movie. Tarantino has his way with cool writing, he sure does. Every movie of his I've seen had at least several moments that were really memorable and badass. I wouldn't say that this movie per se is where it shows most - maybe he's still trying too hard, at times, here, considering it's a rather early movie of his, developed from early ideas- but generally, yeah, this movie has some moments that will definitely make you appreciate Tarantino's badass-ness. Something about the casualness of all the violence here (like the old comedy song says, cool guys don't look at explosions) has both comical and awesome nature.\n\nThe dialogue here plays into this idea of being nonchalantly violent and in danger - characters in life threatening situations can talk about foot massages or coffee like it's nothing. It creates some iconic moments for sure, and this movie is indeed very quotable. Only two significant characters here are poorly written, in my opinion: Winston Wolf and Mia Wallace. Without getting into spoiler territory, I'll just say that the actors (Harvey Keitel and Uma Thurman) can do so much better, and pity that they weren't given characters that are fuller, less amateurish.\n\nTalking about rough-around-the-edges: the term \"pulp fiction\" refers to books that were provocative, full of sex and violence, but also not so good - only made to sell and entertain. Despite this movie being good, I think that the title does fit it. Just look at the poster - it's like a cover for a book that's supposed to lure you in, stories that teenagers will read and hide because they're supposed to only be for adults. The short-story structure, the general violence and crudeness, how it tries to appeal to guys more than to gals. In the end of the day, it is what it is - a fun film, an entertaining one, but far from being a life altering experience for me.\n\nThe soundtrack is great, as always. Tarantino has some of the most iconic soundtracks out there, and not only because he picks good songs, but because he knows how to make it fit to the scene perfectly. Usually they have some cool subtext, and they just turn the iconic-meter up almost every time. Always memorable soundtracks.\n\nThe structure of this movie is unusual, and it's definitely one of the things that it's famous for. It's a cool idea, and though it disturbs the momentum of the movie a little bit it's nothing serious. I do feel like it makes everything a little messier, less consistent, but it's not necessarily a bad thing - this is sort of the point, and I can appreciate that, for better or worse. I also feel like the gold watch story was better than the other ones, btw, but it's not that big of a gap in quality.\n\nTo sum it up: Pulp Fiction fits its title very, very well - just like a pulp magazine, this movie is a little rough around the edges, but fun and entertaining nonetheless. From the classic poster to the dialogue - everything is screaming violent, crude, hot pulp fiction, and I kinda like it overall, despite (any maybe also because of) its roughness. Feeling a 7.6/10 on this one."

And the writing was just amazing how the writer tied everything together so perfectly. And I think that it's the dialogue that drives the movie and makes it such high quality. Everything from the \"gold watch\" speech to Harvey Keitel's dialogue. Quentin always seems to find a way to make the something horrific quite humorous without ever seeming to ask for a laugh. He combines utilitarian prose with flights of rough poetry and a wicked fancy."

What I love too is the serious dark humour infused into the chaos, it makes you question yourself if it is funny or not. But that is what makes it a Tarantino classic. If you haven't watched this film already it needs to go straight to your watch list. I first saw this when I was 13 and I watch it at least once a year. Maybe it isn't to EVERYONE's taste but if you ever find yourself with a couple hours free time. WATCH THIS..."

The movie is Tarantino's 2nd work after having great success with his gangster story of \"Reservoir Dogs\". There are many unique aspects of Pulp Fiction that make it so good. As many of you know, Tarantino's use of dialogue that he gives the characters in his films is excellent, humorous, and intelligent. Pulp Fiction is by far his best in this aspect. From conversations talking about foot massages to talking about filthy animals; PF has the best dialogue of any movie I have ever seen. The movie is shuffled in a way that it tells the story out of sequence, once again a redundant aspect in most Tarantino films. This influenced many different mob films, but no other movie will ever be as great as Pulp Fiction. Film making at its finest.\n\n$$$"

        "review_detailed_main": "Following the success of 1992's Reservoir Dogs, Quentin Tarantino released his finest film to-date, the self-proclaimed masterpiece Pulp Fiction; a film which is arguably the most influential of the last few decades, and one which stands alone as a \"to-be\" classic. Pulp Fiction remains widely regarded as one of the essentials in modern cinema, which has established itself as a film for the lovers of cinema, as those are the people it gets its greatest amount of admiration from.\n\nPulp Fiction marked the new-wave, avant-garde cinema, it became recognised for its vigorously exciting flavour and unfathomable cool. Revolving around a deconstructed narrative, composed of three stories, which are all insanely surreal, Pulp Fiction brings you inside a world Quentin Tarantino has successfully crafted through individuality. The film starts with a lavishly entertaining conversation of tension and wit between two robbers, one being Tim Roth and the other being Amanda Plummer, who kick-start the film with furious energy. This scene is then followed by the infamous conversation of Amsterdam and burgers between the justifiable \"cool\" of Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta). From here on in you have entered a world fuelled by greed and missing-morality.\n\nSure, Pulp Fiction is undoubtedly one of the \"coolest\" and \"hippest\" films around, nevertheless it holds much, much more than that. The film stands as a piece which depicts the psychology of normal people who have been thrown into extreme circumstances, meaning their personalities have changed along with their situation. It is a film which is much than amusingly clever on the surface, as in fact Pulp Fiction juggles allegory, such as the \"freedom\" of Amsterdam being a counterpart for the film's non-conformist, disobedient nature. The film has countless recurring themes, such as redemption, vengeance, spirituality, morality, individual morals, and a person's mannerisms.\n\nEven behind the film's humorous anecdotes there is still a lingering sense of haunting poignancy the film throws upon its viewer. The inviting environments are simply an innovative showcase for a study of one's ethics and the dealing of horrendously problematical situations. The characters are all vigorously layered, with multi-dimensional emotions and spontaneous behaviour. When I say that every actor performs with undeniable perfection, I mean it. From Christopher Walken's cameo as Captain Koons, to Bruce Willis' alpha-male, yet kind-hearted \"boxer-thug\" performance. Everyone in the film sets themselves a back-drop for their character, letting every character differentiate between one-an-other. Yet, as Harvey Keitel states in the film, \"of course you're character, but it doesn't mean you have character\".\n\nDense script-writing, and what might seem like entirely irrelevant dialogue lets Pulp Fiction become its own piece. And rather than being driven by plot, the film is driven by its variety of surreal characters, who all talk in a way which seems so real. Yes, the conversations may not to be the same topic you talk about with another person, but the way in which a conversation branches off to an entirely different topic is something we all do in everyday life. Few films are able to portray dialogue through such a method, which is one of the countless reasons as to why Quentin Tarantino's script is the key instinctive foundation behind the film, since it lays the rules of what is to occur in a latter scene. The script crafts the comedy, as there are no comedic set-pieces in the film, nor is there a comedic narrative. However, the actors' delivery of nerve-biting, ego-driven lines, which brim with humour and emphasised body language, gives the film its distinguished tone of dark comedy.\n\nOne of the reasons Pulp Fiction has become so iconic is due to its diversity in film-making, which is comprised of influences from French new-wave cinema, to Asian crime flicks, yet the film is still entirely original. Quentin Tarantino ultimately creates his own sense of \"bravo-film-making\". The use of tracking-shots, dolly-zooms, variation in lens focus, quick-cut editing, slow-motion sequences, lyrical camera positioning, steadicam tactics and close-up camera shots, the variety Pulp Fiction has is not just held within inside its narrative, but within its technical side too. Then you have the dynamic use of music, which has clearly been hand-picked by Quentin Tarantino himself and suits the film with a simplistic level of ease. The set-pieces are also crafted with scrutinising detail, such as the notorious lair, involving two hillbillies, a gimp and two of the film's protagonists.\n\nPulp Fiction is, quite simply, a hard-boiled, noir-toned masterpiece of modern cinema, comprised of film-making which deserves to be dissected frame-by-frame. The sheer unadulterated consistency of greatness Pulp Fiction follows means it is a film which should be watched again and again. Yes, all the characters might be \"sinners\", yet there is no denying that you will be rooting for a certain character(s) by the end of the film, as surely, with characters as diverse as these there must be someone you share the same belief with, right? Devine-intervention is what Pulp Fiction is, a miracle and one which justifies vast acknowledgement. Take for example Jimmy's (Quentin Tarantino) brief conversation on the \"gourmet\" of coffee, it sums up the magnificence of Pulp Fiction perfectly, not forgetting the addition of \"lots of cream, lots of sugar\"."

Do not judge the bad words, or the places around, look for the speech... that's the real thing."

Director and co-screenwriter Quentin Tarantino kind of wanted to emphasize that the most important thing in every movie is the story and the dialogue, but also to raw material itself without the original prescription can not provide anything more valuable than short-term fun. \"Pulp Fiction\" is one of the titles that we never get bored."

In fact, this movie alone has convinced me that Tarantino has to be the greatest movie maker of all time. This is my go to movie when I can't make up my mind what to watch; I am guaranteed satisfaction!\n\nThe movie has no plot! It is a collection of out-of-sequence stories that make up the last few days of the life of a hit man, played by Travolta. That's it! He and his partner are simply taking care of an errand and it goes wrong, while he also has to take his boss's wife out for dinner to keep her entertained while he (the boss) goes out of town for the night. That, too, goes wrong. Every single thing in that movie just goes horribly wrong and it's just fabulous.\n\nThe acting is compelling. The cinematography is masterful and just sets a nostalgic mood that makes you want to return to. The direction is ... oh well ... Tarantino. And the dialogue is the best ever. Really.\n\nPlease see it."

I'm let's face it, this is still his best movie. I can gush about the performances, specifically Jackson because my god is he great in this. I just wanted to mention Travolta, who disappeared after the Grease and then was crapped on after 'B:E' and 'Gotti'. He's not exactly my cup of tea but even I can admit he is great in this You've already seen it, you've got the poster on your wall.

        "review_detailed_main": "This was one of the films that consolidated Tarantino's career and made him one of the \"superstar\" directors who, whenever he releases a film, whether good or bad, attracts a legion to the cinema. I was never a fan of his, and I don't think I will be. He made some films that I liked and others that I hated. I wouldn't call it regular, a \"safe bet\", but we can't deny it, it's original, true to his style and doesn't seem concerned about pleasing anyone.\n\nThe film follows more than one plot: we have a couple of violent bandits who try to rob a cafeteria, we have a boxer at the end of his career who has to flee after winning a fight he had agreed he would lose, we have a couple of murderers in the pay of a mobster who are tasked with recovering a stolen suitcase, and we also have the capricious girlfriend of that same mobster, whose boredom forces her darling to assign one of his assassins to babysit for her. What unites them all? In addition to the fact that they naturally intersect, they are all part of the same violent, brutal and marginal universe.\n\nFor many, this film is one of the best of the 90's. I would never consider it as such, that is, for me, an exaggeration. It's reasonably good, it's gained cult status, it has fans, but it's not a masterpiece, not for me. It's not a boring film, it doesn't tire us out and the various sub-plots are intertwined very well, with skill and elegance. There's a lot of violence, heavy slang and drugs, and that can be really hard at times, I felt that too. However, this heavier language, drugs and violence end up being a natural part of the underworld of crime and marginality where the characters move, so it's something we can count on right from the start. And there are no sympathetic characters who can arouse some empathy, so it doesn't matter to us whether they live or die in the most unpleasant ways (and some of them suffer a lot).\n\nThese are all qualities, and will be even more valued by those who are more familiar with the \"pulp\" literary subgenre. I'm not, it's not part of my culture, and I even had to go look it up on the Internet to understand what it was, and what its characteristics were. Despite that, there are a few things about this film that I really didn't like or felt over the top. One of them is the dialogues. There are scenes with a lot of dialogues, dialogues without any interest, which can dwell on boring topics, just because. One of them, right at the beginning of the film, is about foot massages, just to give a small example. There are many scenes that seem overly drawn out due to these endless dialogues. I also think the film has too many images of bare feet. Tarantino gained fame as a fetishist, but he always said he wasn't... watching this film makes it hard to believe him. And one of the characters, who is a murderer, makes a very long quote from the Bible... it's the kind of \"literature\" that I think an underworld murderer probably wouldn't know by heart.\n\nThe actors are very good, we have several notable names: John Travolta is excellent in the role he was given, with that black suit and his hair soaked in oil. Samuel L. Jackson is not far behind, and Uma Thurman is fantastic. I would say that, at least, Thurman and Travolta achieve performances at the best level of their respective careers in this film. Bruce Willis isn't bad, but he's just not that interesting. I enjoyed seeing my countrywoman Maria de Medeiros in her only major international role, I'm sorry she couldn't go further, but that's life. Tarantino also appears in the film, and it would have been much better if he hadn't. He's a ham as an actor.\n\nTechnically, the film has many qualities, starting with the excellent cinematography, with vivid colors and good lighting. There are excellent action scenes, for all tastes, and the soundtrack makes good use of several musical themes that we know very well."

The duration of the picture is two and a half hours, they fly by as one minute. The cast is very strong: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth, Bruce Willis and a lot of other great actors that I love and respect. A bouquet that is necessary! I really like the work of Quentin Tarantino, his style is always very different from others, it is difficult to confuse with someone else. Perhaps this picture of all his most cool. The film has everything you need to have fun. Bright actors-stars, atmosphere, humor, dynamics, music and much, much more! This film is memorable from the first time, but you still want to review it. Everything is unrealistically cool, romantic, unusual and interesting. I look and take my breath away. I know all the dialogues by heart for a long time, they are simply incomparable! All the movements of the dance Uma and John have long learned and danced. Who hasn't tried to repeat them? In general, it is very difficult to find fault with something in this film. In my opinion, the picture is perfect! I don't see the point in retelling the plot, everyone knows it anyway. And if there are those who have not seen the picture yet, then I strongly recommend it to raise the mood and get pleasure. I hope that those who love this film very much, I just decided to remind you about it just in case. I wish you all a great mood and a lot of positive emotions. Thanks for your attention."

To be honest, I think the screenplay is massively overrated (although it is commonly cited as one of the best of all-time). It generally mixes ideas from lesser known films and used irrationally to create an ambiance of cool. Though this film is wonderfully cinematic, it must've been tremendously exciting back when it first premiered. I think its exploitation of violence and drugs is a tragedy, and although these consequences do lead to something bad, it doesn't disencourage them. I can't help but resent the film for the fact it's usually the film that gets people into film (can't disagree that it was one of the films for myself, but it has been 7 viewings since) since it offers absolutely nothing new, it just doesn't have a point nor is it a realistic representation of anything - not that I'd like to know, to be honest. If it wasn't such a cult film none of the images would recur. It has a pretty flawless soundtrack though. However, I cannot discredit a film for being overrated and what this film does preach does not offend me. I completely understand the acclaim it gets.\n\n8/10"

His influence is evident in the way that so many young emerging film makers have emulated his rapidly delivered story lines and fractured narrative structure, from Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels through to Go, or Run Lola Run. He remains one of the world's most influential and gifted film-makers, and Pulp Fiction is clearly his most impressive work to date."

        "review_detailed_main": "Throughout the years I often heard how Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece and one of the greatest movies of all time. It wasn't until today I finally had taken the time to sit down and watch this for the first time from start to finish to see what all the fuss is about. Needless to say, this is a very mixed bag for me\n\nWhat I like about Pulp Fiction is the plot being all jumbled up and not straight forward like many other movies where you see how everything begins and ends. Pulp Fiction doesnt do that. It's back to front so to speak starting at the end but going backwards. It feels disconnected and out of place as it tells different stories but they are actually are all connected in a way\n\nI also liked the deep themes and talks of existentialism, nihilism and philosophical talks of God with some of the characters. It also helped the movie had a great star studded cast to give Pulp Fiction and extra umph to it\n\nWhat I dont like is the subplot for Burce Willis's character that involved him and a mob boss being tied up and were about to be raped by two guys with the mob boss getting raped. I hate rape and I hate how it's used in media. It's just awful and always feel sick about it. If I had known rape was a factor in Pulp Fiction I would not have bothered at all. Thankfully though the rapists get what's coming to them in the end\n\nI also didnt like how some scenes and dialogue with the characters fell flat where nothing really happens and it just drags on and on. I actually didnt start to like or get interested until Bruce Willis is in a shootout with the mob boss character but then the rape part comes ugh.\n\nOverall this movie was decent and I have no regrets in taking the time to watch this for my Sunday morning. It's definitely not a movie I'd be considered in watching again, once is enough for me and not to add to my ever growing DVD collection."

The real killer of this movie are the dialogs supposedly so cool but instead being silly and irritating, from the very first scene when endless minutes are waisted talking about a frivolous argument. The violence in this film, rather strong, is very often disturbing but never fun or entertaining. Tarantino takes himself a little too seriously making the movie lose most of its ironical aspect. Unless you are a fan that goes wild for the overweight Travolta, you will find his so-called cult scenes dull and of no interest. All the characters in this movie are exaggerated, and that wouldn't be a bad thing, but they also are not fun. There are some good action scenes, very few, which anyhow will not save from failure a movie that lasts 2hrs 40min!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Let me however extrapolate, embedded in a Pulp Fiction review which I couldn't care less for - on my film review style - from someone who has a media degree in film studies, and began their career wagging school at fourteen to watch French Cinema; and you know what they say about people who have experiences at an impressionable age - it sticks! I gave up on Hollywood in approximately the early seventies after Easy Rider and Zabriskie Point. I even walked out on Five Easy Pieces, even though in retrospect, that wasn't the film's fault, in those days we were keen on life and not on introspection and reflection. Though retrospection, tells me that was a good film. In fact it is the kind of film that the baby boomers now crave, good writing, and good characterisation from a period in history when just being alive was an entertainment, and not bogged down with crazy little computer screens and cowards with their wise-arse messages tweeted because they are too afraid to speak, possibly because even the modulation of the voice has been colonised by trendoids, who are so post-modern and wise-arsed they know everything; but at the head of the pack are a bunch of no-talents who have clamoured to the high ground. And that list is endless in entertainment, now: Quentin Tarantino (highlight-dialogue in Pulp Fiction, \"In Holland, they have mayonnaise on their fries.\" - conclusion - lame) Johnny Depp (the guy can't act, get it? That's why Australians get Oscars now, as Hollywood is beyond knowing, who can act]; Russell Crowe (just because Hollywood couldn't get anyone else to fill out a Roman general's tunic except maybe some wooden ex-wrestlers), he wins the Oscar-but in his next movie, A Beautiful Mind, everyone gets an Oscar except him, because basically, when you play a screw-loose professor, exchanging walking around in circles for walking around in squares, it is not acting! It is a guy walking around in squares cos he worked out that was a riff on walking around in circles]; Saving Private Ryan, though I hate to admit it is a brilliant film - through its depiction of my grandfather's generation, who when I was growing thought wasn't cool; but mine who made every piece of furniture in their house to a French polished standard; as well as, the P. A. system for my Uncle's successful band including the foldback cabinets-which even The Beatles didn't have-as well as keeping a 200 acre dairy farm as a hobby. Cool, I don't think I knew the meaning of the word; but the Juden angle in Saving Private Ryan which is shoved towards the POWs by a man brandishing - a Star of David (on his dog-tags?)-as the POWs march past-I'm not buying because usually and in that war in particular - it is the politicians, the military hierarchy and their bureaucratic underlings who systematically entrench racism as a tool of their propaganda and the common soldier is generally ideologically neuter as they have to follow orders or get shot - otherwise on the western front in 1915 both sides would have turned around and marched home. But that was the only glaring error in my opinion but this ethno-stereotyping, though understandable has spilled into other films, especially the Star Wars epics, by George Lucas, wherein Cowboys and Indians in Outer Space in the early films becomes metaphoric American foreign policy in latter films... to be continued..."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of movie that raising Tarantino to an apex level. He was so young that day, but already mobilizing his career expeditiously. Reservoir dogs, his first movie, is one kind of movie, using a similar 90s retro theme. Those style was an inheritance of Tarantino, it was his original natural-touch. His 90s movies severely enjoyable for young and mid-aged people. Nowadays, his 90s movie prevalent considered as trend-setter which used by so many directors nowadays, for example lets look at kill bill. Stylish but harsh with slow-mo action shot and consider the raid 2 and kingsman : secret service as its descendant.\n\nPulp fiction is a film which considered as classic. Lets try to analyze it distinctly. First thing first, i am gonna highlight the performance of Samuel L Jackson. Indisputably, Jacksons performance is potent. You cant contest this level of characterization without any serious contemplation, because in this movie, Jackson ranked highly in top performance of all time category. Even an amateur audience could say this level of acting is above average. I even feel scared by his act (interrogating scene), its like I've been really charged by a verdict and witness him ready to gut me was really haunting and obnoxious.\n\nSecondly, the writing. Honestly, the plot could drive me from not in a mod into a freak. The joy element implicitly delivered from the writing to the audience. The interrogating scene, driving scene (in early duration), and of course the magnificent dancing scene. All these scenes were devoted by great screenplay technique. For example lets take a look and analyze the interrogating scene. Watch and remember Jacksons movement and watch the camera position carefully. At early, Tarantino using some establishing shot and some full-shot to all characters inside. It brings an introduction message while giving suspense to audience. Jacksons movement from outside the door to in the middle of the room to in front of sofa is a support to these shots. It sends horror expression to the interrogated characters. Then lately, while berating and punishing Tarantino using close-up shot and extreme close-up shot to execute. These give a huge pressure and impoverishing the morale of interrogated person. The force of pressure intensified by slow-paced play as Jackson moving. Those was an example of incredible screenplay and writing technique. This technique also used by legendary director Sergio Leone to his western movies.\n\nThe 90s euphoria direction was the highest aspect of this movie. It shape the whole film with joyful nostalgic of 90s, such as the music and pop culture. The nostalgic invention of this new movie in 90s permeated to the whole audience until now. It persist as a classic nowadays. Tarantino was a terrific boy these day."

        "review_title": "I can't believe that I have to defend this movie.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Normally, I wouldn't bother to contribute my thoughts on a movie made back in '94, but I'm doing so for two reasons: 1.) It is my favorite movie of all time (and like everyone that uses this database, I've seen quite a few) 2.) I just watched it again last night (on DVD for the first time), which motivated me to go to IMDB and read the reviews. I was aghast to read some of the negative comments that this movie inspired in many contributors. The following is more for the naysayers than anyone else.\n\nFor those that championed the opinion that it glamorized drug use and violence: well, this is an age-old argument that's been pretty much exhausted. Summed up in the question: \"does art reflect reality or does reality reflect art?\", I believe that it's a two-way street, and Pulp Fiction, evil intentions or no, rides right down the middle. It's a glimpse of a world that I dare say is alien to most of us, so who are you to question it's authenticity in regards to its use of drugs, violence, language, and a lax attitude towards them all.\n\nFor those that complained about the pointless dialog that did nothing to promote the plot: have you never heard of character development? A lot of the things that have been dismissed as pointless and wasteful can be attributed to educating the audience of the character's thoughts and attitudes. The \"pointless\" conversation between Jules and Vincent about cheeseburgers illustrates that not only is Vincent a traveler (and drug user), but that the two have a good working relationship, share similar interests, and genuinely like each other.\n\nThe \"pointless\" dialog between Butch and Fabienne regarding potbellies is an insight to their relationship. That exchange yes is silly and contributes nothing to the plot itself, but those are the kinds of pointless conversations that are often shared between a couple. It's almost a milepost as to the seriousness of their relationship that they can enjoy such a trivial exchange.\n\nAnd plot? Well, as it's been stated many times: its redemption, stupid. Not only for Jules, but for Butch as well. Anyone who doesn't see that doesn't really deserve to have their opinions read let alone considered with any modicum of seriousness.\n\nRegarding the non-linear editing: is there a real problem with that? Did it really confuse people all that much? Were you still trying to mentally arrange the scene sequence ten minutes after the credits ran, or like most of the people I saw it with, figured out the jumps rather quickly and enjoyed the diversion? Did Tarantino do it simply for the sake of doing it in an effort to be hip and cool? I think not. I do believe it was done in order to have the film end on a high note. The alternative, if he had stuck to a linear formula, would have been Fabienne and Butch riding off on Zed's chopper, and that would have been a bit disappointing.\n\nActing: what's not to like? Have you seen any of Travolta's movies prior to this? Utter trash. With this one performance, he erased dozens of regurgitated, forgetful roles of leading men in mass-produced romantic comedies and dramas. Samuel L. Jackson's performance was simply unparalleled. Bruce Willis, who is normally unimpressive, blew me away with his performance. The scene in the hotel room when he goes nuts after not being able to find his watch was just a joy to watch. Seeing him seething mad at his mate's packing incompetence, and his fighting back that emotion and trying to reflect the blame back on himself...well, just the facial expressions were priceless.\n\nDirection? Are you serious? The needle-through-the-chest scene is perhaps the best directed sequence I've ever had the pleasure to watch. You WERE in that living room with them. You felt the frenzy, you could smell the sweat and the bong water, and you were just as on-edge as Vincent when you realized the potentially bad things that could result from the incident. That intensity could not have been duplicated by anyone of mediocre or non-existent directing talent. The choreography was in a word, perfect.\n\nAnd as far as hype, is concerned, how could such a gem of cinematography not be hyped? In my own defense, I saw this movie THE DAY it was released (and many times since), only days after first watching Reservoir Dogs. Basically, I knew little of Tarantino, but I knew that Dogs was among the best movies I'd seen in a long time. Although I had seen and enjoyed Natural Born Killers and True Romance prior to PF, I was at the time unaware that their origins were with Tarantino.\n\nPulp Fiction deserves all of the hype and all of the praise that it spawned. If you haven't seen it yet, what in God's name are you waiting for? If you saw it and didn't like it, what in God's name is wrong with you? What part of the formula for a good movie is missing in Pulp Fiction?\n\nKudos to those who have praised it, and thank you Quentin for upping the ante of quality movie making. My apologies for the length."

        "review_title": "Violence and Redemption Underscore \"Pulp Fiction\"",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Pulp Fiction\" is considered Quentin Tarantino' masterpiece; both as a writer and director. Although it's not a perfect film and has a couple flaws, \"Pulp Fiction\" has one of the greatest scripts that changed the way films were made. The film opens with a conversation between \"Pumpkin\" and \"Honey Bunny\" as they chat about their new plans to rob restaurants instead of banks and liquor stores. Eventually this scene will end the film as it doubles back on itself. Often times- and we're seeing the case more and more with Tarantino- he'll drive a film on dialogue instead of plot and substitute plot for senseless dialogue. That happens here, but it works most of the time. Lately it hasn't been working on the level of \"Pulp Fiction.\"\n\nUma Thurman plays Marcellus Wallace's (Ving Rhames) wife, Mia, and her only importance to film is to be entertained by Vincent Vega (John Travolta) on a date that's not quite a date. I feel as if these scenes are supposed to entertain us since it has nothing to do with the plot that is extremely thin compared to its run time (154 minutes). Travolta, for me, is the real stand out. When he's on screen his scenes, whether Jackson is next to him or not, are full of energy and pulp. He does a lot of listening, some dancing, a lot of arguing and/or debating, and offers up a lot of great comedic moments. His best scenes are with Uma Thurman when they go to Jackrabbit Slims. This little date, where they talk about nothing of much importance as far plot is concerned, is funny, engrossing and entertaining. I don't know why it never gets old, but it doesn't. The acting between the two is great and both were worthy of their Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress respectively. This section of the film is one of the strongest of the three along with \"The Bonnie Situation.\" The writing and acting is superb in both sections. This date leads to an overdose as Mia takes a line of Vincent's heroine. The direction here is much in the mold of a graphic Hitchcock film. To add to the suspense the owner of the house counts to three (Something that happens quite a bit in the film). As he slowly counts to three we see all the nervously waiting faces in the entire room. We get a close-up shot on the needle that's cocked back and ready to strike. We get a close-up on the red dot where the needle needs to hit. It slowly builds the scene and the suspense. Tarantino handles this scene and all the others with a ton of precision and a lot of confidence.\n\nTarantino makes huge strides as a director since his previous film, \"Reservoir Dogs,\" and a lot has to do with his confidence as a director. The older Tarantino is too confident in his abilities. The majority of \"Pulp Fiction\" has a lot of energy and snap to it. If you watch closely to the opening scene in \"Reservoir Dogs\" you won't see that same kind of crisp, confident direction from Tarantino. There are a lot of pauses throughout that conversation and it doesn't quite flow like a Tarantino film that we've become used to. To his credit he was working with some B-list (Some C or D-list) actors. He's not working with much more here, but the majority of his major role players are all acted out terrifically with the exception of one: Bruce Willis- through not fault of Tarantino; Bruce is just a bad actor.\n\nThe section of the film that really drags, and is noticeably behind compared to the other two sections, is \"The Gold Watch\" section. This section is incapable of greatness since Bruce Willis single handedly ruins it with his \"Die Hard\" facial expressions, especially when they're not needed. The writing here is also the worst and, at times, puts the actors in very difficult situations. This section becomes annoying as we hear Bruce Willis call his girlfriend- that we won't care at all about- Lemon Pie, Sugar Pie, and retard. When he calls her a retard it's pretty funny, but other than that this lacks the punch that Travolta and Thurman provided minutes earlier. This section is bloated with dialogue, bad acting, and uninteresting characters. \"The Gold Watch\" has its moments and definitely picks up when we meet the gimp and the crazy world that we fall into. It just takes too long getting there. Christopher Walken provides a very interesting and hilarious story of the watch that has been passed down anally from generation to generation of the Coolidge family.\n\n\"The Bonnie Situation\" may very well be the strongest section of the film. This is where we meet \"The Wolf\" (Harvey Keitel) as he cleans up a mess made by Vincent Vega in a hilarious scene where he accidentally \"shot Marvin the face.\" \"The Bonnie Situation\" offers up quite a bit of laughs, some great acting, and a very strong ending. The film ends where it started with Jules (Jackson) talking about changing his life around as he \"walks the earth.\" Thankfully Gods interventionist-like hand, that saved him hours earlier, doesn't make him walk too far as He has sent him a weak person for the transitional Jules to save. The film ends on Jules changing or turning against everything he has ever done or known. Instead of being a bad - and killing \"Pumpkin\" (Tim Roth), he gives him some money, out of his own wallet, for a chance to start fresh and redeem himself. This might actually be \"Pumpkin\" and \"Honey Bunny's\" last heist, and they have Jules to thank for the chance at redemption and changing their ways."

It's nothing special. Samuel L Jackson hard carries. Out of the whole movie only him and the wolf felt like they were enjoyable characters. In my opinion John Travolta was last generations timothee chalamet, someone who gets a lot of love but isn't that great an actor and a lot of his line deliveries aren't great.

        "review_detailed_main": "PULP FICTION is a singular show. The best way to describe it is that it is as if you sit down in the living room with the television and are immediately transported to a roller coaster going full speed through a fun house of ghoulish images. This is complemented with one of the funniest, smartest, and filthiest dialogs I have heard in a long time. There is no other movie I can compare it to. It has the adrenaline flow of SPEED, the intelligent dialog of MY DINNER WITH ANDRE, the violence of the goriest part of the GODFATHER, and the comedy of AUSTIN POWERS. All that having been said, it is like none of the above other than the superficial aspects I just mentioned.\n\nIf extreme violence (e.g., brains blown on car windows) is something you can not endure, if 700 uses of the F word is something you can not tolerate, if heavy drug use is something you care never to see (cocaine is passe we learn, all of the in-gangsters now do heroin), then do not pay your money to see PULP FICTION.\n\nOn the other hand, all of the above really works in this show. This is a parody of criminal life and a really funny one. This is a show that takes one chance after another. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are nothing short of terrific in it. Oscars are possible here. They play the hit men for a major bad guy (Marsellus Wallace). The bad guy is also paying a boxer (Bruce Willis) to take a dive. Harvey Keitel plays a fixer of problems for the bad guy. Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer play a couple of two-bit crooks who like robbing restaurants because nobody else does that. Eric Stoltz plays a low class drug dealer and Rosanna Arquette plays his girlfriend who has rings in every part of her anatomy (yes, there too). Christopher Walken shows up in a single long important scene. Uma Thurman plays the major bad guy's wife. Whew, and I probably missed a lot of other people who did some great acting.\n\nThe major hero and the one who took the most risks in this movie was the scriptwriter. He was also the director - Quentin Tarantino. The script went from funny scenes like a restaurant where all the staff were 50s famous look-alikes to a scene where the two hit men were first discussing what a McDonald's quarter-pounder is called in France and why to a discussion of whether it was okay to kill someone for massaging your wife's feet.\n\nThis is a movie that to describe it will only make you want NOT to go see it, yet it is mesmerizing and wonderful. The intensity level of the movie is off the scale. People were laughing like crazy in the theater and to intelligent dialog too. Other scenes had the audience gasping for breath and uttering out loud \"oh, my god\". Several scenes were worse than the finger cutting scene in The Piano.\n\nThe camerawork was mainly standard stuff, but there are several scenes where it got pretty experimental. The best example is the long scene of Wills staring into the camera without moving while he listens to the major bad guy, whom we have not yet seen, delivering a long lecture. It then switches to a view of only the back of the bad guy's head with everything else out of focus while Willis listens for quite a while more."

But there are some movies, which are just the opposite. They cause a violent feeling within you. After watching those movies you may say to yourself 'shit! what did I see?' 'That is so vicious!' or something similar.\n\nIt is obvious that I am referring to Pulp Fiction to the second type. I am sure everyone must be shocked by the way the film progressed. The executions, drug consumption, the lifestyles of thugs, conversations etc. are shown in such a raw way that it will make you think for days about the movie and make you say to yourself 'shit! what did I see?'. The movie gave no explicit messages and just had shown lifestyles of certain kind of people. But this no-message story, is shown in such raw and real way that it will make you see and think about this movie again and again. Hats off to direction.\n\nThat's why the name :\"Pulp Fiction\""

        "review_title": "Redefining the Episodic Film",
        "review_detailed_main": "This film may play with its use of chronology, and it may be episodic, but people generally claim this movie to be great because it is the first to do so. It is certainly not the first film to do either of these things. It is inspired by many films before it, such as Rashomon - which tells the same story from four different perspectives - as well as \"My Life to Live,\" a neorealist film which is told in twelve distinct episodes. However, Pulp Fiction was the first film to play with chronology in this manner in many years, and it is because it does so with great purpose which helps to make it my favorite movie (among various other reasons).\n\nSome complain about this fiddling with chronology to cause confusion, yet the story only goes out of the linear time line in two spots in the film, and I always found it easy to follow. As for the BIG episodes in the film (the ones Tarantino actually gave titles to) the first two are played in chronological order, and the third episode shown jumps back to a spot before the other two stories. I will not got too in depth with my next comment as it would give too much away if I did, but Tarantino's choice to show Butch Coolidge's story (Bruce Willis) before Jules' story (Samuel L Jackson) has a huge impact on the way the audience views Vincent Vega (John Travolta) by the end of the film. It is this fact combined with the way Jules' story ends that left me mind-blown when I watched this film for the first time.\n\nI understand that in the context of 1994 when this film was released that it was an extremely violent film. If you're still going to complain about the violence in this film today, I would laugh and tell you there is no way you could handle more contemporary films like Mongol, 300, or Gone Girl. Hell, I hope you can make it through Django Unchained, Tarantino's most recent and by far his most violent film to date. What people forget to say about the violence in Pulp Fiction is that most of it actually happens off screen, leaving the violence up to the audience's imagination (maybe this is why people remember it to be more violent than it actually is).\n\nWhat I realized and loved about this film after watching it for a few times is that the three stories of this film all have a common connection - they deal with loyalty to a father figure, each one more intimate than the last. We have Vincent Vega struggling to be loyal to Marsellus Wallace (the crime boss), we have Butch Coolidge honoring his father, and we have Jules Winnfield rethinking his relationship with God.\n\nOther than the chronology of the film, what is easily the most notable thing about Pulp Fiction is the dialogue. Tarantino has arguably written better scenes after this film (in fact, I agree with his choice of the opening scene of Inglourious Basterds as his favorite thing he has written), but this is the movie by Tarantino that EVERYBODY quotes, especially the famous scene when Jules dominates the conversation about breakfast and what Marsellus Wallace looks like (trust me, even if you haven't seen the movie you've probably heard a friend quoting this scene). Tarantino is a master of dialogue - he writes conversations that people might actually have with each other. The topics may seem random, but that's how real-world conversations work. You discuss events, make analogies, disagree and argue - you don't simply talk about what is going to happen or what has happened, which is unfortunately how a lot of dialogue in film goes. Tarantino always creates distinct and well-developed characters through his use of dialogue.\n\nThis movie is a roller coaster of an experience, and it gets my highest rating.\n\n4.0/4.0"

It won an Oscar for best dialogue and was beaten for best picture by Forrest Gump.\n\nPulp Fiction tells the story of two mob hit men played by John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson, a mob boss played by Ving Rhames, the mob boss's wife played by Uma Thurman and a boxer played by Bruce Willis. Every single actor/actress in this film plays the role brilliantly especially Samuel L Jackson.\n\nThe part which makes this film so good is its dialogue. About 90% of this film is just people sitting around talking, but the dialogue is so well written and interesting, you could sit and watch them for hours. This film deserved its Oscar by miles. All those who go into this film expecting lots of shoot outs and explosions, are not going to be impressed due to its long, dialogue heavy scenes.\n\nIt has no philosophical messages or parts where you need to \"read between the lines\", if you want a film like that, then I suggest you go and watch something directed by Stanley Kubrick. It's a straight up entertaining film which you don't even need to watch all the way through once you've watched it a few times.\n\nThis film will go down in cinematic history as one of the greatest films of all time. In my opinion, it is the greatest film of all time along with Schindlers List."

He showed us what he was capable of with Reservoir Dogs, but with Pulp Fiction, he made his mark in cinema and it will stay there forever. I love Pulp Fiction, I love it so much. It's just one of those movies I could watch on repeat for the rest of my life and I wouldn't mind it. But what makes it so great? It's basically just a bunch of people talking, the entire movie. But it so well scripted and directed, the Pulp Fiction script is perhaps the best script ever written. Royale with Cheese? Hell yeah! Everyone in film school should read the script to this masterpiece. Needless to say, all the actors in the film have reached iconic status and deliver great performances. Pulp Fiction is one of the most iconic movies of all time. What makes it so great for me is the fact that it's not really about anything. It's just a bunch of random stuff that happens and it has a great script, that's it. But to make a movie about nothing and make it one of the greatest, most entertaining films of all time, is an achievement. Thank you, Quentin Tarantino. Thank you.\n\nWritten and directed by Tarantino, it's considered by many to be one of the most influential and best movies of all time. In my opinion, it is the best written film of all time. Pulp Fiction is a film driven almost completely by its dialogue: It's two and a half hours of mostly people talking and one would think that's a negative but the dialogue is extremely clever and engaging. The performances are brilliant as it features a pitch perfect cast. The directing choices are awesome, the cinematography is perfect for what it needs to be and you can't talk about Pulp Fiction without mentioning the soundtrack. Possibly the greatest soundtrack in a movie ever. The dialogue is so good it features so much quotable dialogue.\n\nI'm a big fan of structure in most movies but the beautiful thing about Pulp Fiction is that it's not really about anything. It's just a bunch of stories mixed together to create an entertaining film about gangsters, dancing the twist and foot massages. There is only one scene in Pulp Fiction I dislike, because I really feel it does not advance the plot and it feels like it slows the movie down for me and that is when Butch and his girlfriend are in the hotel room at night. The scene lasts like 5 minutes only at it feels like it could have been trimmed to two. However, this is really a minor detail. Pulp Fiction is one of the most entertaining movies ever made and it is an essential viewing for any film lover in general.\n\n9.7/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I submit this film is actually ( albeit crime ) actually a redefined renewed genre ! As in R D this narrative takes risks in its style of of story telling which is virtually a Tarantino invention ! yes it is true of course, every director has his or her unique style of moulding and honing their story , Tarantino aims his tails in a unique mix of his own well thought out concoctions . I cannot think of any examples , but anyone who loves cinema will have seen some films that failed in their attempts to copy Tarantino. Therefore, that statement , it seems to me , is clearly indicative that this director has always triumphed over all attempts to either go one better than him or out fox Tarantino in the hope of overpowering his style of sculpting . That is how uniquely brilliant Tarantino is, similar to Gaugin or Michael Angelo he is a true artist in his creations As has already been said, to try and get some level of comprehension of this film , it needs to be seen a number of times. The same appreciation and more clarity of understanding is precisely the reason we continue to learn more and acquire more depth of real academic learning every time we return to the National Gallery in London or the equivalent American , Italian or French art galleries . Every viewing of the Mona Lisa we see something previously overlooked, or did not previously fully understand ! The first page of training for a successful film director comes from his or her hours and hours of intimate study of form, substance, and colour , of photography also. Kubrick began his career as a monochrome photo journalist , thereby learning about framing and all the artistry that follows that ! Tarantino i suggest either had a natural eye and sensibility of form, or ( possibly and ) studied from a very early age, as much as he was able with regard to form, framing and colour hues ? And only at a slightly later time in his younger days started writing story lines and ideas ?"

I watched the movie last night for the first time in awhile and was struck by never really knowing what was in the brief case, so I watched the scene in great detail. I noticed the apartment number was #416. So thinking this is probable related to a bible verse I looked up one starting with Matthew 4:16. I don't read the bible often if ever but since the Movie has the lighting up brief case locked at 666, and Jules set for a path of salvation on seriously changing his ways from a gangster to walking the earth in the path of the Shepard I thought to look it up. So Matthew 4:16 reads \"the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned.\" I think this relates to the brief case, the people who had it, to Vincent which stayed in the land of the dark and ended up dead, and to Jules which turned to \"the path of the Shepard\" as he says. A great light was shone to Jules (which was currently living in the land of the dark) after the bullets whizzed by him and a light dawned as it did for all the others in the room which where also all living in the land of the shadow of death. Just a theory but better than anything else I've looked through yet."

It is the epitome of a postmodern film - with no conventional story structure, no central conflict, no clear moral, achronological 'storytelling', and so on. It definitely needs to be appreciated for its incredible style.\n\nBut as with most postmodernist art, tossing aside everything that makes traditional art good sure stands out as bold and unique, but it comes with its negatives. And unlike most reviewers I don't think being 'unique' is a sufficient substitute for being devoid of the traditional things that make a film good.\n\nFor instance, this movie does not have great pacing. Partially a result of the lack of (conventional) plot development and story structure, but also partially a result of the often (deliberately) mundane dialogue. I realize postmodern art can often be very self-referential, but I personally can't see why a lot of this dialogue had to exist. It doesnt immerse you, it doesnt engage you, or advance the plot... its usually not even funny. So whats the point?\n\nBut what is the point in general? Pulp fiction meanders around without really giving any core messages. Perhaps right at the end in the epilogue scene, it says something meaningful and ties at least some of the themes together quite well. And masterful as Tarantino is, the scene is just ambiguous enough to keep people talking about what exactly it means.\n\nSo yes, this is a great movie to analyze and critique, but its missing too many ingredients that make a story great to experience."

Maybe all of us were just allergic to Tarantino's sick fascination with violence. The violence is just so gratuitous and casual as to make it seem like a bad video game. Outside of that, the overall movie has the feel of being viewed through the eyes of someone high on bad drugs.

Up to that point, movies I watched were one dimensional action flicks with clich\u00e9 characters and predictable plots. Pulp Fiction made me laugh, cringe, yell out loud, cover my eyes and get nauseated. It was the first movie that I saw that I couldn't stop thinking about for days after. I watched it again and again, picking up new details, and connecting the dots. This film opened my eyes up to a whole different genre of movies and a whole new appreciation for storytelling. It was unlike anything I'd ever seen, and in some ways, still is. It is full of memorable characters, scenes and quotes. Simply awesome."

Characters in a total panic as things go more & more wrong is a staple of film & TV comedy, but when overdone it can be really irritating.

And Quentin Tarantino absolutely doesn't fail to make it great.\n\nThe story is driven by multiple but few characters characters that all serve their own purpose. Pulp fiction is filled with incredible action scenes while also keeping a realistic feel with personal conversations, regret, and emotions.\n\nWith great performances by every single actor involved especially Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta who both do amazing jobs in keeping the movie realistic while also showing a lot of emotions.\n\nThe movie is also incredibly filmed. With amazing angles and shooting scenes that make Pulp fiction a beautiful film with beautiful scenery, it's truly one of the best films from the 90s.\n\nI highly recommend you watch Pulp Fiction, it's a beautiful film with amazing acting and actors that all perform incredibly."

What I don't understand is this- Why does this film have such a bad reputation. Just think this over, please, all of you people who wail and complain about how horribly violent it is.\n\nHow on earth are you so isolated as to think that this is the most violent movie out there? Have you not seen any movies since 1994? Because believe me, this movie could practically slide by with a PG-13 today (well not really) But honestly, if you don't like the move, then sure, fine, you don't like it, but why would you attack it's content when there are so many other movies that are MUCH more violent?"

There is Titanic and Terminator, there is Night of the Living Dead and Gigli. There is The Godfather and Space Jam. In a world of several hundreds of thousands of movies, the most familiar and yet still original is Pulp Fiction.\n\nPerhaps life long cinephilia breeds a great filmmaker? Perhaps \"veteran\" actors are better than more contemporary actors? Perhaps dialog can be one of the most memorable parts of a film? While only a handful of films top Pulp Fiction in terms of quality, and craft, at 154 minutes, it remains cool, cocky, and deeper than what is led on during the first viewing.\n\nNot telling you about the plot is probably best for those unfamiliar with it. To call it a film with out a message is incredibly arrogant. Reading between fairly thick lines is a story about human redemption and choices. No mainstream movie maker has attempted what Tarantino does here.\n\nThe characters are interesting, along with the acting in terms of greatness, and deep, along with the dialog, cinematography, storyline, and direction. Compared to Tarantino's Jackie Brown, it is very in your face, in a good way. You'll actually get to appreciate movies more after you see Pulp Fiction.\n\nThe violence presented in minimalist, and very tastefully done. But best of all, it is, well, cool. It leaves me feeling shaken, like a powerful wave comes over me.\n\nDon't go in with any expectations however, experience it pure. Then you realize how fantastic it truly is. My hat's off to you, Quentin Tarantino, and if you haven't seen this movie already, see it. Twice."

The Bruce Willis \"Gimp\" scene is memorable but a little sicko, and The Uma Thurman sequence(you know the one) is absolutely unbearable. She and Travolta(too fat to dance and never a terrific actor) almost ruin this 1994 Tarantino film single handedly. But no, it is Tarantino himself that ruins the film; everyone is nasty, it's excessive, the way the three stories are told is confusing, and...that's about it. Some of it is funny, and Ving Rhames is good as Marsellus Wallace, but this is too much for me. I know many like Tarantino, but I think he's a show-off in the grand tradition of John Woo(one of his heroes apparently)."

        "review_detailed_main": "There is just so much to say about this movie that I don't know where to start!\n\nI had no idea what I was \"in for\" when I went to see this movie. I really hadn't seen the previews for it, and had read nothing about it at all. Usually, this is the best way for me to go into a movie...otherwise I have too many expectations. Well, even if I *had* known something about Pulp, I don't think I would have expected what I got. Not that I'm complaining.\n\nPulp Fiction takes you on a roller coaster ride wherever Tarantino feels like taking you. And what a thrilling ride it is! From the opening scene we're left scratching our heads wondering exactly where Quentin is going to lead us on this one. Is it another Natural Born Killers? Another Reservoir Dogs? Although there are nods to his other films, as well as several others, Pulp Fiction stands on its own. From shocking to downright hysterical...this movie has it all.\n\nSamuel Jackson is incredible (although I'm quite partial to him anyway) as the Bible quoting Jules. John Travolta is tremendous as Vincent and is purely delightful to watch as the story unfolds. The cast could not have been more perfect and Tarantino brings the best out in each and every one of the actors and actresses.\n\nIs there excessive use of the \"f word\"? Well, sure. But c'mon! We're talking about \"gangsters\" here (not to mention the 20th century)...for reality sake the \"f word\" really has become a part of everyday language for many people. Aside from that, it *is* a Tarantino film and, well, he's not exactly known for being a prude.\n\nGlorifying violence and drug use... Oh boy, don't even get me started. The LAST impression I got from this movie was some sort of message stating: \"it's ok to do drugs and kill people\". Ummm, no. Ok ok, so there may be teenagers who see this, you say. Well then here we go on the \"it's the movies fault that there are problems...\" tangent. I'm not even going into that one. Bottom line regarding the drug use and violence: if you are *that* impressionable, you probably shouldn't be watching anything beyond a G-rated Disney movie...and even that is questionable.\n\nAll in all, Pulp Fiction was a fantastic film. With its fabulous acting, perfectly cast crew, and hilarious moments, Pulp is one thrill after another. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is willing to see it for what it is and can focus on the movie...not the bits and pieces taken waaaay out of context. 10 out of 10 stars."

This plot moves in and out of several related stories and the time-line jumbles around so that the way it is presented, it enables us to see the hand of God. We see justice served and spirituality wins out and the evil gets killed, and/or embarrassed and/or other nasty things.\n\nWe start the movie in a restaurant and watch a husband and wife robbery team begin a robbery. There are two hit men in that restaurant. We move in and out of a story of the two hit men who work for a mobster named Marcel. We watch the hit men pull off a hit and get the money that the victim (played by Frank Whaley) owed the mobster Marcel. I got a real kick out of Whaley repeating \"What?\". The hit-man points his gun and says: \"Go ahead, say \"What\" again! I dare ya! I double dare ya! Then Whaley's character says \"What?\". BLAM! He is shot in the leg.\n\nWe watch as one of the hit men Vincent Vega (played by John Travolta) takes Marcel's wife out on the town, per Marcel's orders. Vega fears his boss Marcel's jelousy. Additionally, Marcel's wife ODs. Then we watch a frantic rescue effort bring her back.\n\nWe watch as a boxer (played Bruce Willis) is told and paid by Marcel to throw a fight. Instead this boxer pummels his opponent to death in the first round. Then he attempts to gettaway with the help of a lady cab driver, who was turned on by the killing.\n\nThere are many more surprises in this movie and a reason why I called this \"Evil Blood and Guts Meet Up With Spiritual Redemption; and WHAT?\". Every minute of this movie should make you look at the screen with your eyes opening very wide and quote Frank Whaley's character \"What?\"\n\nThis is easily one of the best movies ever and many have tried to repeat it, but never come close."

Critically-acclaimed picture caught fire with audiences as well, resulting in more show-biz success stories than any other film of the 1990's. Is it really that good? Yes, the verbal interplay and canny, cheeky handling is quite often exhilarating, and the performances by Travolta, Jackson and Willis (and Harvey Keitel as a low-keyed Mob kingpin) are near-perfection; however, the film's mixture of queasy, bloody violence (undermined by the jokey tone) and the barrage of foul-mouthed, low-life characters can easily become wearing. It won't be to everyone's taste, surely, but it's a visceral, gripping cinematic experience nevertheless, one with a knockout soundtrack and an Oscar-winning screenplay. *** from ****"

I had no idea since the film epitomized non-sense making.

Creativity is not easy when the rules of reality are imposed. The reason why it took me several sessions over several years to finally assimilate this boring piece of filmdom crap is simply because its silly story and peculiar characters are one dimensional sensationalistic nonsense which almost anyone could have created and I personally found them boring...not unlike Sunday morning cartoons. Of course that criticism flies in a face of incredible popularity by the public and critics alike not to mention an Oscar and countless other awards. Go figure. Bottom line, \"Pulp...\" -is- pulp fiction brought to the big screen with all the gratuitous filth and violence of a dime novel but without the one thing which could really have made it interesting. Why no T&A???"

Released in 1994, a year which gave us Forrest Gump, Shawshank Redemption, Lion King & Speed (including Hum Aapke Hain Kaun & Andaaz Apna Apna). Any other year it would have grabbed every Academy award possible, but Tarantino had to settle for only one i.e., Best Original Screenplay.\n\nProbably one of the best display of non-linear screenplay, this film revolves around eight characters Pumpkin (Roth), Honey Bunny, Jules (L. Jackson), Vincent (Travolta), Mia (Thurman), Butch (Willis) and Marsellus Wallace (Rhames). Not to mention some of the great cameos from Keitel (The Wolf), Walken (Captain Koons) and Tantino himself as Jimmie. Even if you aren't familiar with any of these names, this chaotic comedy is still worth everyone's time.\n\nTarantino's great taste of music is clearly evident with some of the finest soundtracks suiting the scene will blow your mind.\n\nGOAT!!!"

Much like the log scene makes a King Kong movie. The scenes with Willis are livelier than the scenes with the two dull, obnoxious hit men who get way too much screen time, and put the viewer to sleep. The surface plot of this movie is pretty dull, and it's tough to care with the poorly written characters, but it relies on its \"iconic\" style of trash talk and actions. The hidden plot of this movie is the title itself of \"Pulp Fiction\". This movie has mixed allusions to different eras. Sometimes, it is the late eighties and early nineties, but more often it is the late sixties, early seventies, with the rotary phones, clothes lines, rarity of billboards, and the songs people tapped fingers to in those days. What we have is essentially a make believe world in which kids from the seventies think the world is like outside, where everyone carries a gun and is either a boxer, gangster, killer, or lunatic. The \"modern\" images are all imagined by the seventies kids thinking they'll be in such a world when they grow up. A decent idea, but it could have been done better with more interesting hit men. The Bruce Willis character, and his performance, help salvage this, though."

What a shame for Travolta that this was his 'comeback' film. For me, the only watchable part of this film was the sequence featuring Bruce Willis. Even that, though...how Willis was convinced to be in this film is a mystery to me. Cameos by Emil Sitka, Christopher Walken's brief part, and Harvey Keitel's appearance cannot save this self-indulgent and troubling example of a director gone wild, suffused with the sense of his own talent.

The story pushes itself in a way that differs it from the other Hollywood movies made at the time. It doesn't really follow a normal \"Guy wants something, gets it\" kind of storyline. Instead it barricades a more Leonesque technique. The kind of storytelling which one would see in old and mostly forgotten pictures like \"The Trio\" or \"Once Upon A Time In The West\" where the story is much more complex than a guy wanting and getting something. This revitalised, superb storytelling, when combined with Tarantino's more down to earth dialogue and imagination, gives us the classic film that is Pulp Fiction."

Only more-so.\n\nPulp Fiction is an exquisite patchwork-quilt of a movie, stitched together from ideas, elements and scenes gathered together by Tarantino during his formative years as a movie-obsessed video store clerk. Assembled with an unerring eye for detail and the vision of a true artist, the film is a marvel to behold\u2014over two and a half hours of pure cinematic brilliance which proves just as captivating for me now as when I first clapped eyes on it almost two decades ago.\n\nBold and bloody, with stunning performances from a wonderful ensemble cast, a flawless soundtrack, witty (and highly quotable) dialogue, and even a character called Brett, this impeccable slice of gritty neo-noir is fully deserving of top marks. 10/10."

That doesn't make it a masterpiece. This is hollywood garbage. There are some scenes that are sick. The movie is SICK. This is my review. I gave it a 2/10 just because the actors are respected.

Then the same two things happened on the third and fourth viewings until I finally stopped.\n\nThis is an extremely profane film laced with a lot of dark humor. I have a machine that can filter out much of the profanity and I often appreciate dark humor, but blowing a guy's brains out in the back seat of a car is funny? What am I missing?\n\nTwo things I will say: the film doesn't lose me despite being two-and-a-half hours. There are no boring lulls and the dialog is fascinating in parts, mainly between John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. Their discussions are unique, to say the least, and one certainly remembers Uma Thurman's role and Travolta slamming a syringe into her chest.\n\nWith 240 f-words and the Lord's name in vain 28 times, I miss a lot of sentences with the filter. It's still an interesting film.....in a perverse way. The other thing: yes, there is some dark comedy in here but overall this should NOT be labeled a comedy, or God help us all."

I had every intention of loving \"Pulp Fiction\" just as much as I did back then, but I didn't. There was nothing there, no core. All the things I'd loved about it were gone. That clever dialog? Referential nonsense that gave no insight into who I was watching or attempted to expand the narrative. The great characters? Indistinctive cardboard cutouts that act as mouthpieces for Tarintino. Fantastic storyline? A pseudo throwback to film noir that can't decide whether it wants to take itself seriously or be intentionally stupid for the sake of irony. Gripping violence? It's violence that's harsh enough to put the average viewer in awe, safe enough as to not offend.\n\nIt's a dead film with no ideas. A common argument I hear in it's favor is that it's somehow objectively entertaining. Why? Because it has guys with guns and monologues about McDonalds? Sorry, but that's not entertainment in my mind. Entertainment is being engaged, having to think. A film like \"Andrei Rublev\" is entertaining because, while I watch it, it evokes thought and feeling, it has something I can sink my teeth into. I can still think about it, interpret it in different ways. \"Pulp Fiction\" is just shutting your brain off for two and half hours while a man with a God complex strokes his ego.\n\nBasically, I can understand to some extent why it is so popular. It's very good at pleasing the masses, something Tarkovsky could never do. It's so perfectly designed to hook the average viewer in. But it's paper thin. This is exactly what I don't want in cinema"

Marsellus is paying Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to throw a boxing match. Vincent is told to entertain the bosses' woman Mia (Uma Thurman).\n\nThis is Quentin Tarantino's big breakout. I saw this in the theater and probably even before 'Reservoir Dogs'. I definitely saw 'True Romance' before this but I had no clue who to praise for the dialog in that movie until I put two and two together. This is a cinematic explosion. Many tried to copy his style but none exceeded him. It is super cool. It's got the time jumble that adds so much fascination to the movie. Again many films try to copy it but few succeeds like this. It has to be one of the iconic movies of the 90s."

The side characters are more accessible and reminiscent as friends of ours then they are as plot worthy points of interest. They discuss everyday trivial matters intensely while the viewer is wondering about the ramifications of the events just watched or know is around the corner.... and we actually see very little violence play out! Tarantino's use of the chopped up time line only added to the Pulp mystique as well as it's charm. Imbecile gangsters charming? Regressive American social interaction cinema worthy? When combined , it remains a perfect storm for Quintin & company."

        "review_detailed_main": "It took me next to twenty years to review this film appropriately; i should say, it took me the best part of ten years to realise that not everyone might see it my way. Under close scrutiny, the world of cinema goes this way, more or less: Kurosawa, a Japanese, and two italians, Fellini and Antonioni, subvert just about every rule that Hitchcock laid down; then nothing else happens for thirty years, with Hollywood slowly draining the life out of world cinema (see Transformers 2), until a guy called Quentin Tarantino released this second film, after the poor (or great, if you are a traditionalist) Reservoir Dogs, called Pulp Fiction. And it obliterates every rule that every filmmaker across the civilised world ever tried to establish.\n\nJohn Travolta takes flight to a role so high across the sky that no reviewer is ever going to be able to demolish it, no matter the angle. This is the role that will inspire humans for the next two hundred years; this is the Shakespeare of the modern world. The first director to utilise black actors effectively. The first example of 100% quality production after the dust and sweat of traditional Hollywood arenas.\n\nPulp Fiction is a film of such incredible intricacy that it's unfathomable to anyone but a big-brain film school student, and even than, who knows. Do not feel ashamed if you miss its finer points. But for history, this is the one, the only, the film that takes over from Yojimbo, from 8 1/2, from La Nave Va, from Shichinin no Samurai, and more ... and just moves on forward. There is more film in twenty minutes of PF than there is in the whole of a typical Hollywood production of the 70's. So there are those films above this one. Space Oddissey. The Godfather. These are just targeted products. You will never find someone who has a coherent film critique of Pulp Fiction. Mastery in work, spark of genius, there is no way that this film can be any less than\n\n10/10 and the best film ever made."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sorry to degrade from the structure of how things go, but this is a hybrid between a review and a defense of the film.\n\nAs far the movie itself, I could be locked in a room for a few weeks with it. It's what movies where made for. It is entertainment- sure and simple. I'm not gonna dive really into what the movie tries to do, because I see that more as a viewer's perspective. I can say, however, that whatever it it tries to do it does well. The acting, the dialogue, and everything else about it is gripping. The most overarching thing about it to me, though, is the absurdity. The absurdity is concocted at just the right angle so as to create a strange world, but one we can dwell our minds in. Reality itself is absurd in itself, is it not? This is what particularly draws me into this movie, and makes me like it so much.\n\nThis is also the reason I think a lot of people hate it. The main insults toward the film regard it's \"lack of plot,\" \"lack of core,\" and \"lack of meaning, or anything at all.\" Did I miss some section of the Geneva Convention that mandated how a movie had to be made? Yeah, typically a more linear and mountain shaped plot/ story line give that feeling of satisfaction at the end, but leave that to other movies. There are plenty to spare.\n\nPeople accuse it of being hollow as far as spirituality and meaning go. I find this kind of funny and ironic because I think that is exactly how it emphasizes these two subjects. The interactions and experiences of the characters in this absurd reality are what make it so real. We really don't have lives much different from Vincent and Jules. We're all figuring it out as we go, , under pressure of constantly changing circumstances, making decisions for ourselves in a place where we don't have much direction.\n\nIf you can't find in this movie what others do, I guess you just aren't catching with them. It's really a matter of choice. These are all things that make Kurt Vonnegut novels what they are. Lack of tangency with seemingly pointless digressions. But that is what makes them brilliant. They place a film on life to view it with a new perspective. It's up to you how much value and entertainment there is in something like that."

Some may find the scene of Jimmie in the kitchen hilarious, but I feel it's ruined by the over-acting of Tarantino and the expletive-filled rant which sounded forced and fabricated, losing the edge of unintentional humor and genuinely bizarre situation. Luckily, the scene of Jules in the diner with Ringo and Yolanda had very little foul language, but it's the most powerful scene. There are other places where few or no expletive could make the humor and/or drama just as gripping if not more so. Overall, a 7 out of 10."

The stories are not typically Hollywood like, meaning that they are not predictable and don't follow the Hollywood movie rules. What makes the stories even more great are the dialogues. The movie is filled with the famous trademark Tarantino dialogues and is a true pleasure to listen to, they are very raw and realistic, just like the characters. Brilliant dialogue!\n\nThere are countless classic scene's and some of them are up there with the most classic out of movie history.\n\nThe movie is filled with some great music that sets the movies mood.\n\nThere is a big all star cast with actors such as John Travolta, Samuel L.

Everything a movie could ever need. Pulp Fiction won the Golden Palm at Cannes and the best original screenplay at the Academy Awards. For me, it has been the best movie ever made followed by Amores Perros. A film with very deep and strong content. Pulp Fiction is all about two hit men, their boss's pretty wife and a boxer.

This movie is Also Bruce Willis' BEST performance by far. Most people talk about Travolta who is wonderful, but Willis pulling off a truly sympathetic and likable character is amazing.

        "review_detailed_main": "Simply put Pulp Fiction is the silliest film I have every seen, it puts Battlefield Earth and The Long Kiss Goodnight (spookily starring the two leads from this film) firmly in the shadows, they look like rare vintage wines next to this cheap plonk. The fact it is so highly revered by so many, and even considered profound, makes me fear for the very existence of modern society. There are some fundamental reasons I dislike this film with a passion, the first being the pacing and substance, the film really mirrors it's director to perfection, yapping and a mumblin and a stumblin from start to finish, enthusiastically about....Nothing! If Qentin was not such an untalented, cretinous buffoon I would call him the new David Lynch. The only substance in PF is of the white powdery verity, the film is just a collection of sick images splashed on screen willy nilly strung loosely together by some sharp but pointless dialogue. The film was too crude, made purely for shock value. When violence, male rape, drug abuse, accidental shootings and other such fun filled things are packaged as cool and even as comedy in the hands of an immature director you get a highly irresponsible film, and to sell it as some sort of 'smart art' piece is doubly irresponsible. Then there is the complete lack of character development and depth. There are no characters, only 2 dimensional machines created solely to perform acts of severe violence and drop in a few wise cracks, they perform actions in one scene that seem to have no effect or relation to what happens in their next scene. Not one of them is even slightly likable or in possession of any redeemable characteristics apart from perhaps Butch (Willis), did I mention he is a violent thug, murderer and a thief? Then there is Mia who seems to have little purpose in the film other than an excuse to include the very uncomfortable scene where an over weight Travolta boogies on the dance floor. Yes she is in the 'famous' needle scene as well, but what else? The section featuring Vince and Mia was just dropped and barely mentioned again like Mia herself, so what was the point? A question I asked of the film throughout. I quickly realised that nobody in the film was there to be developed, any one of them could have been dropped (apart from Butch) or their actions performed by a completely new character without making a spot of difference to the film, their actions were not to be the subject of scrutiny. That would be asking too much of the Tarantino who is clearly only interested in attempting to make stuff look cool. He is the most unoriginal man on the planet only capable of tacky 'homage' (ie, he is a thief) action films. Don't believe me? Watch Kill Bill where he even pays homage to his own film, this one! I do give credit to him in one respect. He realised that if he re-jigged the order of plot events he could not only look artistically swish but he could disguise the fact that the story is not worth the toilet paper it was written on, impressing upon many the fallacy that the hack job narrative structure enhanced the story. The direction is experimental but quite frankly tacky and laughable at times. One scene featuring a near comatose Butch in particular comes to mind, the camera is stuck dead still on him while Marsellus (Rhames) uses the m-f word 100 times in about 5 minutes, totally amateurish. The only memorable performance is from Jackson, who could make the ingredients list of a packet of cookies sound fun, he is offset by a flat performance from Travolta. That brings me to the 'witty' dialogue which, apart from the violence, is the crux of the piece. It is unfortunate then, that this dialogue basically consists of idiots talking a load of nonsense about such deep things as cheeseburgers, milkshake, foot massages, cleaning up skull and brain chunks and some coffee that is described as gourmet s**t. Some dialogue was witty but mostly it was just utterly pointless, the characters deliver it with such perceived style and coolness despite the fact they were talking about, frankly, a lot of BS. Add this to the fact there is (barring brief moments in Butch's story) no plot, no emotion and especially no substance and you have one worthless film. \"Ah you don't get it\" they all scream, don't make me laugh, the circular narrative and the ham-fisted attempt at redemption at the end does not equal substance. The ending was hilariously cheap, obviously a desperate attempt to justify a pointless 2 hour string of images in one strike. Is it meant to be profound? Well after sitting through the whole film which consisted of characters that were never developed adequately, where no actions or events were properly tackled, challenged or explored with any great thought or depth during which I was never required to care even once, I was presented with one of the most cheesy, pointless monologues in film history. Oh and a parody of QT's fans - the briefcase is opened and they stare at the shiny thing and go \"ooooh, it beautiful\". It is all a hollow gesture when you consider the character that delivers the speech and his actions directly following it, combined with the entire sequence of stupid events that precede it. Many movies these days suffer similar problems at their conclusion because of obvious limitations in plot structure and development, some have endings that invalidate the rest of the film, others have endings that are invalidated by the rest of the film, with Pulp Fiction QT has somehow achieved both simultaneously. You'll figure out what I mean. As a rule I don't usually let a film's director put me off the film itself but, after Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction, Tarantino films are now the exception."

Some people find it confusing. Rubbish!. The structure of this film is one of the things which makes it so good and original. when put in chronological order, the story makes complete sense, the stucture is not a gimmick.\n\nThe cast of this film is truly excellent. Travolta got nominated for best actor at the Oscars but lost out to Tom Hamks (who was truly deserving as forest gump but, IMO, not as much as Travolta was as Vincent). The character of Vincent is a scumbag but Travolta's performance makes him lovable and funny and likable. Sam Jackson also puts in a stunning performance (The scene in the diner is truly stunning acting).\n\nI could talk this film up all day but i wont. Just go see it and you'll see for yourself how films should be made."

But I could find not a single thing wrong with this movie.\n\nI avoided Quentin Tarantino's movies ever since I saw my first one, which was Kill Bill. I thought it was appalling - the storyline has been done before, the violence was over the top, the gore was stupid, the acting was shocking, and we won't even go into my dislike for Uma Thurman here. I was persuaded to watch both this movie and Reservoir Dogs by my best mate, and after much reluctance I finally acquiesced. And thank all the Gods I did.\n\nThis manages to be one of the most violent, brutal movies ever produced. However, in a complete paradox to the statement I just made, there is next to no violence in the movie - it runs, much like Reservoir Dogs (but not to the same extent) off the witty and intelligent dialogue, and the incredible acting displayed by everyone involved. And yes, this includes Uma Thurman, despite my hatred for her - I regard her as a terrible actress, whatever beauty she may hold (and let's face it, there ain't much) and I refuse to watch most movies she stars in. She played a small role in this movie, and for once she actually played it well. I extend a hearty salutation.\n\nI must give a hearty thumbs up to John Travolta at this point. His character, Vincent Vega, is easily the best I have ever seen him play. Whilst he is a criminal, a junkie, a torturer and a murder, he manages to be extremely likable and you can't help sometimes but wish you were him.\n\nTo those people who dislike intelligent movies - I advise you against watching this movie. The film grabs you by the balls and doesn't let go until the entire 114 minutes have expired, but if you're possessed of a lower IQ then by the end you won't have much of an idea of what's gone on.\n\nThe film is constructed in Tarantino's trademark nonlinear fashion, meaning that if you want to watch this movie you haver to do so in one sitting to understand it. you can't just watch bits and pieces of it, otherwise it will make no sense to you whatsoever.\n\nI have regained a previously nonexistent respect for Mr. Tarantino with this film, and I look forward to perusing his works in more detail later on.\n\n\"Get the Gimp!\""

Bruce Willis gives one of his most memorable performances ever as a former boxer that ends to go out of town with his girlfriend after saving his former boss (Ving Rhames) in a holdup. Uma Thurman shines as the boss' wife and in supporting roles Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette and Tim Roth are very good and entertaining to watch. Quentin Tarantino's direction is top-notch and the cinematography is slick and stylish. The soundtrack is great and memorable. The only complaint I have is that at times there are some violent moments, but since it's the only problem I cut it here.\n\nSince there are more than 2,800 reviews for this movie already I won't try to give a deep analisys or discussing the plot.

        "review_detailed_main": "I won't hide the fact that my comments here are directed toward the people that don't like this movie, but my foremost goal is to clarify a few issues about this movie that some people just plainly don't have right.\n\nIssue 1: The movie is gratuitously violent!\n\nWell, yes and no. I admit that for it's time 'Pulp Fiction' seemed excessively bloody and does at times glamorize violence, but if you review the film frame by frame, you'll realize that most of the violence is implied. The famous needle scene and Marvin's unexpected end actually show less than you may think. Tarantino stealthily cuts away at the exact moment when the audience expects to see something gruesome, and everything that we think we saw only occurred in our imaginations. Now apart from those two scenes, there is a sword fight and a few executions, but none of them are as gruesome as what one would expect to see in action movies.\n\nThe reason why people believe the movie is so violent is because of the extraordinary tension that Tarantino builds up in every scene. Bret's interrogation creates incredible tension because everyone knows that it will explode in violence, but they don't know when. Vincent's \"accident\" is excruciating to some people because they see the gun bouncing in Vincent's hand just before it discharges. People find it painful to watch because what they fear would happen is exactly what happens. I know some people dislike this movie because everyone laughs at the violence. They don't seem to understand that the audience is supposed to laugh. The laughter is there to relieve the tension because otherwise the movie really would be gratuitously violent.\n\nThis movie is a caricature of criminals and neurotics, and the point is to watch them react to their world. Fans of this movie are not blood-thirsty and do not find it cool to kill people. What so many like about 'Pulp Fiction' is how Tarantino builds up his events and then pays them off so elegantly that some mistake it for a director trying to be cool. He isn't trying. He's succeeding very brilliantly.\n\nIssue 2: The non-linear story is confusing and pointless!\n\nThis issue that some people have with 'Pulp Fiction' really bewilders me, and it's plainly obvious that the people who says it are conventional movie watchers who don't like to put effort into what they're watching. These mainstream movie-goers want plot points and character arcs that can be diagrammed. While there's nothing wrong with linear story-telling, non-linear movies can be a relief sometimes, especially when it's done well. 'Pulp Fiction' is a perfect example of non-linear story-telling because the movie cannot be told in a linear fashion!\n\nThink about what would happen. The movie would begin with Jules and Vincent, but then Jules' redemption would happen midway through the movie, Vincent would go on his date with Mia, and finally Butch would have his turn. The movie wouldn't make any sense! People would wonder why Butch was introduced so late, and Jules' redemption would feel less meaningful because it would no longer be the focus at the end. But as it is, the movie begins and ends perfectly. Tarantino introduces all the characters at the correct moments, and he places the chapters in such a way that it brings more focus on the characters rather than the plot.\n\nIf the movie had ended with Butch riding away, it would have felt drab and awkward, but ending with Jules feels ennobling.\n\nIssue 3: The dialogue is meaningless!\n\nI know it shouldn't, but this issue really ticks me off sometimes because there's not a shred of truth behind it. It's like complaining that Mozart's music has too many notes. People complain not because there's too many, but because they're just too lazy to listen to all of it and interpret what it means. As Roger Ebert says, Tarantino's dialogue is \"load bearing.\" Take the \"Quarter Pounder with cheese\" discussion between Jules and Vincent. Some may believe it's frivolous dialogue, but the information we learn from it makes a reprise in a later interrogation and initiates the mounting tension in that scene.\n\nThe discussion of foot massages introduces the imposing threat of dating Mia Wallace, and Fabi's speech about potbellies is used to hide the fear in her situation. She's trying to comfort herself with pillow talk so that she won't have to talk about hiding from the mafia. Honestly, 'Pulp Fiction' is the most quotable movie ever made. At times, the dialogue sounds like poetry. The conversations do not jump or bounce, they flow and ebb with the sounds always hitting their emotional cues. It's a rare film that can be just as entertaining when listened to rather than watched.\n\nIf you are one of those few that cannot at least appreciate how well Tarantino creates his characters and narrative structure, then don't bother complaining because I already feel sorry that you cannot enjoy the movie as so many do. At the very least, you should not criticize the movie with false and shallow comments. Because really, in the end, you're only embarrassing yourself."

When it comes to philosophies or preferences, we're not static creatures because we realize obstinance is not a virtue. We change, we evolve - that is to be human.\n\nWell, my opinion of Pulp Fiction has underwent several cataclysmic upheavals since I first saw the film in its year of release, 1994. I was 14 and, without exaggerating, Pulp Fiction shattered my concept of film. I'd never been so excited, intrigued and in love with a film. It forced me to reconsider what quality cinema was - it was no longer just the greats, the Best Picture winners, etc. Great cinema could be anything - old gangster movies, film noir, B-horror flicks, 1950s melodrama. The film also prompted me to explore film on a more academic basis, as I began reading film theory and film criticism regularly.\n\nI worshiped at the shrine of Tarantino and watched everything he put his hands on - be that Destiny Turns on the Radio or 4 Rooms.\n\nHis other work (even Reservoir Dogs, which, I am convinced, is nothing more than a decent first film) disappointed me, but I never once second-guessed Pulp Fiction. Jackie Brown in 1997 re-affirmed my faith in the man, but then he disappeared and a funny thing happened, I second guessed Pulp Fiction.\n\nThe dialogue, which I once thought brilliant, was not stilted and forced - a little too hip for its own good. The acting was all right, but seemed weaker than I remembered, and the once brilliant story became trite. The masterpiece became, in my eyes, pretentious, though still watchable fare. On my list of 100 favorite films, it fell from the top-10 to the upper 70s.\n\nYears went by, I continually found myself drawn to Jackie Brown (I think it's Tarantino's most mature wok and a wrongfully maligned masterpiece), but I avoided Pulp Fiction. A friend who had never seen the film asked one day if we could throw my copy on and it was like watching it for the first time.\n\nEverything that seemed forced or trite was brilliant. The dialogue that seemed overly stylized now seemed perfectly stylized and, really, perfectly at odds with the plot, which, though it contains recycled elements, became an energetic, hyper-kinetic, and amazing narrative again.\n\nPulp Fiction quickly returned to the top of my favorites list. Why the swift rising and falling? I have no idea. It could be that QT created a film that is so tied to its audience's state of mind that their reaction to it is a complete crap shoot for him. That's doubtful. What I think truly happened is this: my adolescent mind reacted to its pop-culture references and its manic pace. It was hip and cool, really, and therefore perfect for your alterna teenagers. I matured, grew disdainful of things hip and cool (it was obviously cooler to dislike things that were cool right?), and so began disliking PF. I grew up a little more, became a little more perceptive, and therefore able to appreciate exactly what QT does with narrative and dialogue. Pulp Fiction, though this may seem odd, is a very subtle movie. Its brilliance at first seems superficial, but dig a little deeper and you'll find a film that is narratively amazing and that carries emotional weight. It's not all style; it's not just hip. It's an intelligent and wonderful movie and I don't think that I'll change my mind on it again."

But we knew it was a rate R movie and we couldn't go watch. Well I was so relieved and triumphant feeling when I was finally old enough to see it. It held up really well!! Tarantino may be a creep, and may have issues with acknowledging his whiteness and all but he does know hot to put together a decent movie. Perhaps one of the biggest accomplishments of this film in particular was reviving some Hollywood has-beens. John Travolta's career was 5 and a half feet under and Pulp Fiction basically revived him. He also threw in Eric Stoltz and Rosanna Arquette who were not really super relevant anymore. I think at least when I saw this movie for the first time I also saw Bruce Willis in a darker role than I had previously seen him. I appreciate that Tarantino uses actors in ways we are not always used to seeing them. This movie has great action, good cutting between storylines, entertaining dialogue and per usual a killer soundtrack and of course plenty of the shock value we know to expect from his movies at the time. This is probably his best film for sure."

The story is cleverly put together and elegantly flows from character to character. The story is funny, brutal, disturbing, and memorable. The story is told in a nonlinear fashion and requires the audience to pay attention. Tarantino has created some of the most complex characters in cinema. They all have personality and are relatable in various ways. The dialogue between the characters is amazing. The ending is stunning.\n\nThe acting is very good. Tim Roth, Uma Thurman, Samuel L. Jackson, Harvey Keitel, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Amanda Plummer, and Ving Rhames all perform extremely well. They all give their characters a certain flair and keep the story going with their individuality.\n\nThe pacing is perfect and the runtime is justified because Tarantino builds his story and characters slowly.\n\nThe amount of cursing in this film is, in my opinion, unneeded. I found the extent of the swearing excessive. The use of violence is perfect though.\n\nPros: Elegantly told story full of memorable moments, a lot of funny moments, amazing characters, great dialogue, amazing acting, perfect pacing, and a good use of violence\n\nCons: Excessive cursing and the runtime can be long for some\n\nOverall Rating: 9.1\n\nP.S. Pulp Fiction is a classic that should be experienced by all movie watchers. I would recommend being over the age of 18 because there are a lot of sexual situations and dialogue."

The dialogue is witty and the acting cool and slick.\n\nPulp Fiction is a brilliant story split into three tales about different groups of people and how they're lives become intertwined. The events though, do not appear in chronological order. This makes the movie much more interesting. Tarantino arranges his first scene to merge with his final one in a remarkable way. Those confused by the structure will see everything clearly once the final line is spoken. The first of the three stories starts off with Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega (John Travolta). They are making a hit for their boss, Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). On their way to this hit Vincent tells Jules that about his upcoming job for Marsellus and how uneasy he feels about it. His job is to take his wife, Mia, out and show her a good time (nothing sus). This story goes on to show us the time had between Mia and Vincent. \"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who in the name of charity and goodwill shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and a finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.\" This is Jules' (Samuel L. Jackson) version of Ezekiel 25:17. And it is this that he recites before he kills. But the rest of the story is about Mia and Vincent and their time together. The Second story, \"The Gold Watch\", is about a boxer, Butch (Bruce Willis). It starts off with the story of his gold watch that his dad gave to him. All of the trouble that he went through to giver him his watch. After this reminisces, it comes to the present where Marsellus is paying Butch to throw the upcoming fight. I wont list the events that happen in this part of the movie, as I don't want to spoil anything. The third and final story, \"The Bonnie Situation\", clears up a few things. This chapter ties up the start of the movie and tells us how it got to the point in the cafe. It also introduces Jim (Quentin Tarantino. Vincent and Jules take a dead body to his place in order to clean up the car and so forth. This is where the Wolf is called in. (Harvey Keitel). This last scene is a great example of closure and how the characters lead up to the events already shown in the movie (hope that made sense).\n\nAn excellent movie. Again, the dialogue was witty and everything in it had that feel that come when watching a Tarantino movie. 10/10. Fantastic. Will be next to impossible to beat"

Bear in mind, it was before internet was relevant and watching movies online was possible. Therefore it was a must see. And after the movie i was satisfied but also asked myself self: Was that it?\n\nSome years down the line i've seen more contemporary TV shows from the US and it became clear why Pulp Fiction stood apart. As the title suggest it is a pulp novel brought to screen, done brilliantly, if you accept there is an extraordinary way to do a below-average thing. Why the critics saw a masterpiece in it is hard to explain, but it simply isn't. There were other things where Pulp Fiction excelled. For example, the soundtrack became an inevitable part of any CD collection at the end of the 20th century.\n\nThe way i understood Tarantino after watching some interviews, he is a movie buff and makes movies he always wanted to see. Although not the only to try this approach, he is one of the lucky few that made a living out of it.\n\nOverall, Pulp Fiction is an exercise in marketing. The title, as well as author's statements, suggest it is an entertaining movie. However, a lot of people read higher meaning into it, elevating it's reputation to being one of the best movies of all times."

There was no redeeming value to this movie. It was awful and should not have been given a rating R, or, for that matter, have ever even been released to view. I guess if you are morbid and over 30, they should have rented it to you, but no one under 30, and certainly no one under 21, should have been able to see this movie. I was sixteen when I saw it, and I was appalled. I was not impressed by the colorful display of language, drugs, sexual immorality, or violence in this movie. They should have created a new rating for this movie, no one with any type of morals should see this movie, whatever letter that would be. To see this movie, and see the high rating, shows me why there are so many murders every year... and why there are school shootings."

        "review_detailed_main": "After Reservoir Dogs Quentin Tarantino was asked to direct Men in Black, Speed and numerous other titles, however he refused all so he could concentrate on writing the masterpiece that has now become the daring, hilarious and beloved Pulp Fiction. Pulp Fiction was originally planned to be three separate stories all written and directed by a different person. Tarantino got Roger Avery and Tony Scott on board but after a few months of writing Tarantino realised that he had to direct the full thing. He adopted novelistic techniques such as non-linear structure and intertwining narratives to craft the astounding story of two robbers, two gangsters, a gangster's wife and a boxer. The film is a glorious \"F you\" to conventional storytelling, there is no plot but somehow it manages to pull you into a world of witty dialogue and horrible violence. There isn't a moment in this film when I fell bored, after each rewatch it always retains the same joy I had upon my first watch. Not only is the film great in of itself but opens up a whole different world of cinema I had no idea existed. It's because of this film I discovered Jean-Luc Godard and Federico Fellini, it's because of this film that I found the treasure trove of Roger Corman's Edgar Allen Poe adaptations which then led to me finding the cult classic Faster Pussycat...Kill Kill! This movie managed to have so many references, without every feeling contrived, that there's probably still some ones only known to Tarantino himself. Although the directing is top-notch there is no doubt that writing is the star of the show, Tarantino manages to go off on tangents about burgers, feet and five dollar shakes without ever making a dull moment. Tarantino says the Sicilian speech in True Romance is the best of writing he has done, but for me every line of this film beats that speech. Not only did this film have a profound impact on audiences, but it also greatly affected directors and writers at the time. Pulp Fiction did for 90's and 2000's what Easy Rider did for the 70's, stuck the middle finger up to \"normal\" films and decided to go in a completely opposite route. Pulp Fiction completely changed movies after that. Guy Ritchie came about,adopting the same intertwining story technique and the same sense of humour and we must not forget Amores Perros and 21 grams all amazing films influenced by Pulp Fiction. The affect this film has had on the audience and film in general is why I value it as one of the greatest movies ever made (and is also why I watch once a month, I just can't help myself)."

I read somewhere that this film is a landmark of modern cinema and has influenced many other gangster flicks after it. That certainly makes sense, has a unusual plot line(if you can call it that) for it's time, has grotesque violence and obviously not taking itself too seriously.\n\nMoreover, no subject matter, to me it felt the scenes were purposely constructed to give off artsy notion and not develop the story. It seemed like ''art made for the sake of making art'' which is pretentious in my eyes, however many people obviously find it riveting.\n\nThere is this sequence of scenes which is so completely out of left field that will most likely make you feel emotionally disturbed (don't want to spoil it). Again, it is completely random, however made me chuckle. You can't help but admire Tarantino's audacity to put the most shocking things in front of the eyes of millions. Did not like him as an actor though, the incoherent digressions were a bit too much at a certain point.\n\nIf you are expecting something meaningful, skip this one. It definetely leaves you with sense of emptiness when over. The thought \"What on earth did I just watch'' was swirling in my head for some time after. Don't think I would consider rewatching it."

        "review_detailed_main": "It may sound odd finally getting round to 'reviewing' 1994's 'Pulp Fiction' as there's really little that can be added to everything that's been said about it over the years. Yes, it's a true masterpiece which has - and will always, I would imagine - stand the test of time. But is it for everyone?\n\nIt's Quentin Tarantino's second film as writer/director and, even with all the greats he's turned out since, most people will say that it's probably his best (and I'd agree). However, if there's actually someone out there who hasn't seen it and doesn't even know anything about it, how would you describe its story? I guess you could call it a 'gangster' film with various stories which span different characters which are skillfully (if loosely!) woven together. It's also filmed out of 'chronological' order, meaning that a character may die halfway through, only to return later on in the film simply because the end of the film is technically set before the mid-way point. Confused? Stick with it. It's worth it.\n\nIf you check out the main poster associated with 'Pulp Fiction' you'll see the - now iconic - image of Uma Thurman's character to sell it. Even though she is indeed a 'central' character to the plot, you'll notice a whole load of famous names in the small print, including John Travolta, Bruce Willis and - of course - Samuel L Jackson (in what was totally his 'breakout' role). This is definitely an 'ensemble' cast and, due to the multiple story threads, not all these names will be on screen for as long as you might like them to be. However, that doesn't mean that anyone turns in a bad performance.\n\n'Pulp Fiction' has made it's mark on not only the Box Office and takings, but also on popular culture. It's either quoted or lampooned to this day and most people will 'get' any references made to everything from the numerous quotable lines to the crazy outlandish settings the characters find themselves in.\n\nDue to the extreme circumstances involving very 'adult' themes, this film is not for children. And it's all the better for it. This is because it will - hopefully - limit those who just don't 'get' it. For all its greatness, it's not an easy watch. You can't just have it on in the background while you idly check your Instagram account on your phone. You really need to invest your time into your viewing to get the most out of it. Because of that it's not for idle viewers. It's made to be watched properly (and then debated afterwards, no doubt - people still wonder what was in the briefcase to this day!).\n\nIf you're not a fan of violence, bad language, drug-usage or films that play with the element of storytelling in order to mix things up a little, then you may find much of 'Pulp Fiction' a little hard to watch. However, even if you're not sure about it, I would advise at least giving it a go, simply because it one of those rare films where audiences and critics actually agreed that it was a 'true' masterpiece. Plus, as I've eluded to, Samuel L Jackson's performance is worth a viewing on its own, let alone with all the other amazing performances as well. They don't make them like this any more. Even Tarantino has never - quite - managed to recapture what he managed here."

The chapters are famously unchronological and I believe it's a testament to Quentin Tarantino's creative genius and skills as a writer that a lot of its potency and impact as a film can be accredited to its unconventional sequence. Its a film about perspective, at least that's what I took from it, and I appreciate how the only real \"point\" or \"message\" it has is precisely that anyone can come to a conclusion about it, much like the theories revolving around the contents of the briefcase that pushes the plot forward in the first place."

Now, at first this may seem boring and pointless, but after a closer look, you'll realize that there is one thing about these stories that stands out. The dialogue. Every conversation is unrealistically realistic. People will go on long debates and monologues about everything from french burgers, the metric system, foot massages, tasty burgers, refreshing beverages, why some guy got thrown out of a window because of a foot massage, divine intervention, good coffee, comfortable silences, and just walking the Earth. Every conversation seems like an exaggeration of a conversation you might have. This is only made better by the intermittent action and violence that occurs, which only adds to the complete absurdity that makes this movie so great.\n\nPulp Fiction is one of funniest, most interesting, and most enjoyable movies I have ever seen. 100/100. An absolutely necessary watch."

A must watch cult movie that can teach actors and filmmakers the real way to make great art. I have watched this movie tons of times, and each time i watch it i get more in depth of what things actually meant. Also \"Reservoir of Dogs\" is very recommended. One of my most favorite movies of all. I am a big fan of filmmaking in general and its very important to watch classics to really put yourself in the mind of the filmmakers at the times when action and horror movies hasn't yet trashed Hollywood. Have Fun watching and Happy Journey!"

The most embarrassing thing about this movie is after watching it you will think who is the fool yourself or the writer and directer.Yes this movie is different but not always Difference make something great at least in motion pictures at least.Whatever this is a must see movie for all because you can differentiate the better movies after watching it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Now, what can I say about \"Pulp Fiction\"? You've all heard of it and may be wondering what all the hype is about. I won't delve into all the details in this review so the best I can do (without spoiling the movie) is to just explain some of the things that were great about it.\n\nA noticeable quality about \"Pulp Fiction\" that really struck me (and part of what made it so great)was the dialogue. The dialogue dwells on seemingly pointless subjects, such as what a quarter pounder with cheese is called in France, yet is so encapsulating. 80% of the film is dialogue and surprisingly, it is consistently kept interesting. Whereas in most movies, the dialogue seems to jump around and pass away as the story moves along, the dialogue in \"Pulp Fiction\" sets itself up to be played out in future situations(You'll see what I mean) and in this way, Tarantino is able to create many instances of irony and maintain a solid story.\n\nIn an interview Quentin Tarantino discussed the nonlinear script and explained that if writers can use this format in their books and have such freedom in their storytelling, why couldn't he? How right he is. Tarantino started nothing short of a revolution in the film world by doing so. With the 5 different mini-\"stories\" in the film(Jules and Vincent, Mia Wallace and Vincent Vega, the Bonnie Situation, the Diner, and the Golden Watch) Tarantino unravels each of the characters' stories and shows the viewer what happens after and before what appear to be clich\u00e9 situations. The result is something the likes of which you have never seen before. And not only that, Tarantino was able to intertwine all of the different stories and bring them together into a unified theme, ending with an iconic scene that will leave you speechless.\n\nAt this point, I must address the complaints of many people who think that \"Pulp Fiction\" is merely a flick that revels in drug use, language, and violence. On the contrary, \"Pulp Fiction\" is essentially a moral story with a strong theme of redemption yet it is told through \"immoral\" characters(hit men, robbers, mob bosses, etc.). Think of all of the great literary pieces in history that were banned and condemned for their immorality but are praised for their genius today! Of course, there's nothing wrong with a good Disney movie for family fun and moral values, but Tarantino's style provides a breath of fresh air to the cinematic community.\n\nNot to mention all of the other motifs, plot devices, and iconic scenes, \"Pulp Fiction\" is abundant with thrills, chills, and laughs. There is nothing more I can do except to say, get off your butt, go to blockbuster and rent it. \"You won't know the facts until you know the fiction\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "When Pulp Fiction first came out, I thought it was the greatest movie ever made and was sure that it would become a classic. Earlier today though, I saw it again after not viewing it for several years and my opinion of it is now a bit lower.\n\nIt's still a good movie and there are aspects of it that are certainly great. The plot is well constructed and the story lines are compelling. There are a variety of interesting characters and many humorous and dramatic scenes. Several actors (who were at their peak at the time) have juicy roles and give excellent performances: Uma Thurman, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, and Christopher Walken. Overall, the movie is unbelievably entertaining.\n\nAfter seeing Pulp Fiction again though, with several more years of movie viewing experience now under my belt, parts of it look amateurish. The shots don't always work; composition is bad, stuff is out of focus, lighting is bad. Although the banal conversations are fantastic, the dialogue doesn't work all the time either, particularly for Samuel L. Jackson's character. When I listened to him, I couldn't help but think that this is how a white dude thinks a black gangster should talk. There are also a ton of obvious continuity and factual errors in the film that are distracting (check the \"Goofs for Pulp Fiction\" page here at IMDB for an incomplete listing of them). In most movies, I don't notice these kinds of errors because they're so subtle, but in Pulp Fiction they're glaring.\n\nPulp Fiction is still cool and enjoyable, but it seems like I can look at it in a more critical light now. It's been almost ten years since it was made and the hype is finally starting to die down. It's a good (maybe great) film, but it's not a classic or a masterpiece."

This is a masterpiece, not because of the storyline, but of those who make the storyline.\n\nThis movie isn't about who's the hero, what you win in the end or the survivors of something. This movie is about people, people just like us.\n\nThe characters couldn't have been better. In any other movie, if a boxers girlfriend started talking about that she wants to eat a pie, I couldn't care less. In this movie, you care.\n\nYes, its great that Tarantino made a \"pulp fiction\" of the movie, but the strongest card is the characters.\n\nThe acting is great, the music is good, the directing is super. This is the Movie with a big M.\n\nSo, if you've only watched it once and don't get it, please watch it again. You wont be sorry."

A unique piece of work, it will have you scratching your head, & begging for more! It won so many awards & deserved to win best Director Oscar, but was beaten by Forrest Gump. Such a shame. That movie isn't in the #5 spot on this site. So undeserving. My review will not contain a spoiler as I have too much respect for this movie. I can't wait for the Grand Theft Auto movie to come out. Samuel L. Jackson will star in it for sure. It will be the best movie of all time, but until then I guess we'll all have to settle for Pulp Fiction. I've seen this movie over 100 times, and I never tire of it. There are many unique film-making traits the director has, such as non-linear story telling (probably something he invented), clever dialogue - all created from his own mind, specifically for this movie. Not written for a book or interpreted by someone else, it was his work exclusively & he deserves all the credit. A true genius. I can't wait to see what he thinks up next. I will be waiting in line. I hope he makes a movie to even rival his own work. I believe it can be done. Hopefully within the next couple of years. I wonder what he's up to right now, probably chilling with his piles of cash on top of a large pile of cocaine & naked ladies surrounding him. Damn that sounds good. He's my hero. A true man of men."

Original Writing: Even though Tarentino has said that his films are throwbacks to many older Japanese films and spaghetti westerns, there is one original recurring part of his films that makes them incredible to watch even if the story sucks and thats the dialogue. His characters are so beloved by many of his fans because they're so interesting to listen too.\n\nChapter 2 . The Way It Was Told: If you think about it Pulp Fiction is a simple story but the way that it was presented to its curios audience is why it's such a memorable movie. Even though Reservoir Dogs had the same story arch as pulp I don't believe that it was executed in to it's truest potential. Well Pulp Fiction Filled in the cracks with more character development in a shorter time period because of Tarentino's improving skills in fast and witty dialogue. The way that the characters are introduced and dismissed from us i feel is a type of miscellaneous presentation that I had never seen be done before.\n\nChapter 3. Soundtrack And Acting: While watching this incredible experience for a seventh time the other night with the presence of my father who admitted before watching that he is not the biggest fan of Tarentino's taste in music . I on the other hand find that is soundtrack is amazing in every movie. I t influences music lovers and aids the style of the story. Many artists had their debut with this movie such being Neil Diamond.\n\nAnother aid through the film is the acting in which is very believable and coooool!!!!!!!!!!!! Jackson,and Therman became someone and Travolta was saved at last with a good role. But whose performance really stuck out for me was Ving Rham's when he was down in the basement giving Bruce Willis the low down low. The same goes for Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer's dialogueing at the beginning and end of this fantastic film.\n\nSoooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Overall see this movie. Twice!!!!!!!! Actually see it three times, no four time, no, oh I don't know. Buy it, buy it and cherish it for all of time because it truly is a masterpiece."

        "review_detailed_main": "Controversy is usually good for movies. It's helped push movies to box office success just to see how bad they actually were, and I think that that is one of the ways Pulp Fiction has become so immensely popular. I've heard multiple people musing about the excessive violence, the drug use, the language, and more. So I really wanted to see Pulp Fiction beforehand, but curiosity piqued my interest. I have to say that all of the hype didn't really add anything. It wasn't very violent (or it could be that I'm just desensitized to violence, but besides one scene, I've seen worse on TV), the language just seemed to flow normally (or maybe it was because I had seen Bad Santa the day before and it had about the same concentration of language), and the drug use\u0085well, I expected it for it is a movie about drug abusers.\n\nPulp Fiction is less a complete movie than a series of interrelated stories, the most interesting of which is Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta) as two gangsters who often have pointless conversations. Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) is a boxer who accidentally kills his opponent in the ring and then he realizes the thrill of killing people. Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) pays Butch to throw that fight, but when he kills the guy, Marcellus gets Jules and Vincent to whack him. Along the way, Vincent has to take Marcellus's wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out, and along the way she OD's. Got all that?\n\nThere is one thing that Tarantino can do that no one else I've seen can do efficiently. He can work with time so well that you don't even notice it. Christopher Nolan first tried it in Following, unsuccessfully, and then executed well in Memento. However, there, he held our hand throw it, while Tarantino just lets it rip and hopes we can figure it out for ourselves, which we can do. That adds to the already thick layer of coolness that is in Pulp Fiction. Each character is memorable, especially Jules, who quotes from the Bible right before killing someone. It's just a very hip experience.\n\nPulp Fiction cheerfully takes clich\u00e9s, chews them up, and spits them out in a whole new vein. Like what Kill Bill did in the beginning, with the retro opening to set the mood, Pulp Fiction is halfway between an homage to gangster films and parody. Also, it's a trendsetter. The classic dance scene between Vincent and Mia at Jack Rabbit Slim's (which is a parody of all of those stupid throwback restaurants) has been parodied itself, as has the scene where Vincent and Jules are talking about McDonalds' Quarter Pounders.\n\nIn addition to the layer of coolness, Pulp Fiction also has a lot of humor in it, much of it at times when you know you shouldn't laugh but you do, and also out of situations that you wouldn't laugh at usually. I'm sure some of the parts I laughed at were just because I wasn't expecting something to happen, or maybe I just have a morbid mind, but a lot of the humor came out of the violence.\n\nEveryone in the cast had amazing chemistry with each other, which added believability to a somewhat unbelievable story. The only reason that Pulp Fiction did not get a perfect score is that one scene with Butch and a cab driver went on for too long and did little to service the plot. Knowing me, though, I'll soon change the rating, but it can still be said that Pulp Fiction is one of the most influential movies of the 1990's.\n\nMy rating: 9/10\n\nRated R for strong graphic violence and drug use, pervasive strong language and some sexuality."

I, for one, fail to see how this movie resurrected the career of John Travolta as his performance was just totally unbelievable. Focusing on what appears to be several unrelated life experiences, Tarrantino once again utilizes his penchant for violence, drug addiction, rape, and other assorted seedy topics. The plot (if you want to call it that) is non-existent and the scene involving Ving Rhaimes is just flat-out disgusting. For Tarrantino fans, this may be the ultimate. But for me, it's just not a good film."

Bringing some of the greatest actors together: Urma Thurman, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Walken & Ving Rhames. Having solid actors really pushes the films to it's greatest limits.\n\nFor some minor things, including the retarded rape scene with the cop and I wish Urma & Smauel L. Jackson should be in the film a bit more. i'll go through all the positive things about the film.\n\nDialogue, 10/10: The dialogue was hilarious and at times very powerful and the swearing was over the top which I loved.\n\nStoryline, 9/10: The plot was very stylish and very easy to catch all the time and I like the flash moment back at the start. SO I think that deserves tremendous credit.\n\nActing, 10/10: Do i need to say anymore, it was freakin fantastic.\n\nScenes, 10/10: Everything about this film is really great and all the scenes (except for the rape scene) excellent and well executed. Most of the time I found the scenes really funny and for good reason, for e.g. I found the $5 milk shake or the story of a watch, lol. Even the action is compelling.\n\nEverything is well stable in this film and I highly recommend this to anyone who hasn't watched this yet. I'm so glad I watched this film NOW!!!!.\n\nI give it an easy 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "What else is there to say about Pulp Fiction that has not been said? I am tempted to stop writing here but a one-liner review is never going to do justice to Quentin Tarantino's cinematic masterpiece. So, if you will, let me ramble.\n\nAfter the breakthrough at Sundance that was Reservoir Dogs (1992), one would be hard-pressed to find a film-making talent as precocious as Tarantino at that time. Here was a man who, before he started making films, worked in a video store. Such was his fascination for movies that he began to write stories while at work, obviously influenced by the culture he was immersed in.\n\nWhat happened afterwards was the stuff of legend. His \"stories\" became Reservoir Dogs, and two years later, he made the Palme d'Or winning Pulp Fiction at age 31. To my knowledge, the only American filmmaker I could think of who won the coveted Cannes award at a younger age was Steven Soderbergh for Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989) at 26.\n\nThe fear of making an explosive debut like Reservoir Dogs is that it is tricky to score again. With Pulp Fiction, Tarantino not only scores but has created the perfect goal for himself. Easily one of the top ten films of the nineties, Pulp Fiction is a lengthy film that weaves four stories together in a non-linear narrative structure that continues to impress with each viewing.\n\nThe four stories are as follows: One, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) are two mob hit men who work for Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), a ruthless gangster boss, and are assigned to retrieve an important suitcase. Two, Vincent is tasked by Marcellus to take his wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out for the night leading to an unexpected circumstance. Three, Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis), a boxer, betrays Marcellus by not losing his match, and runs away with his betting money instead. Four, two small-time robbers are dining in a restaurant when they decide to spontaneously rob its patrons.\n\nOne way or the other, the four tales are linked to each other. Expertly crafted by Tarantino (who won an Oscar for original screenplay together with co-writer Roger Avary), Pulp Fiction pushes the envelope for cinema writing, influencing a new generation of filmmakers such as Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (Amores Perros, 2000; 21 Grams, 2003). While it takes some time to understand what Tarantino is trying to do, there is never a moment of confusion in his storytelling.\n\nThe performances in the film are outstanding, and are made even more memorable by the brilliant interchange of dialogue among the characters. The signature Tarantino verbal banter is laced with witty remarks and nonsensical debate over irrelevant issues from foot massages to quarter-pounder burgers. Tarantino picks at the itsy-bitsy of American popular culture and brings his stylish brand of film-making to the forefront of that very culture he is trying to redefine.\n\nPulp Fiction's lasting legacy lies not only in its imitable screenplay (there are so many quotable lines), but how it revitalizes a tired genre \u2013 the gangster crime-thriller \u2013 to suit contemporary tastes. As much as the film is about violence, drugs and sexual fetishes in suburban America, it is also a powerful tale of redemption, most notably encapsulated by a thought-provoking monologue by Jules in the final act, which in itself, is a stunning closure to its prologue.\n\nSCORE: 9.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Quentin Tarantino's second film contains a confusing storyline, lack of in-depth plot, no obvious message, and a seemingly never ending amount of dialogue.....and it works. Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece of contemporary film that has been applauded by critics and fans alike. The films non-linear storyline contains the stories of a couple who robs diners, two hit men who do a job for their crime boss, and a boxer past his prime who is asked to take a dive.\n\nThe cast does a fantastic acting job that varies from Bruce Willis' street smart Butch to Uma Thurman's Mia who has a taste for nose candy. The two actors who shine in the movie is the duo of John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. Travolta's character goes through a variety of emotions throughout the film such as his laid-back side while riding in the car with Jackson, to the intensity in his face while saving Uma Thurman's character from an overdose. Jackson's character has a ferocity to him that makes the character very memorable.\n\nThe camera work by Tarantino is wonderfully done with shots that include his trademark trunk shot and Mexican standoff. Also, there is a well put together soundtrack to the film. The masterful film making and acting in Pulp Fiction makes it my favorite film of all time."

I hadn't seen John Travolta in a film for several years and was looking forward to seeing him again. THe advertising poster looked nice but when the movie started, i was immediately turned off. I waited for it to get better; waited for the storyline to begin to take shape. However, during the first 45 minutes, i witnessed film footage that was difficult (to put it mildly) to watch. At minute 46, I gave up and decided I could no longer watch this trash and walked out. The film stinks. It was awful, it was terrible, it was disgusting."

Quentin Tarintino, who directed Reservior Dogs in 1992, takes four tales and makes a classic gangster tale. The movie is packed with screwy dialogue and extreme surprising characters. My reaction? My reaction was that Pulp Fiction was that it was funny, exciting, thrilling and excellent. Pulp Fiction was a worldwide explosion with audiences and critics saying the movie is fun, thrilling and funny throughout. I sat through Pulp Fiction one night watching it on AMC and I thought, this movie is fun. It's cool and crisp. At the end, it was all-out conclusion. Though the stories are out of sequence, it still can be fun without knowing characters in random areas. The movie won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.

It is a film that contradicts all the norms of Hollywood, and focuses solely on intricate and detailed moments of characters. We don't get back story, we don't get explanations. All we get is scene after seen of pure entertainment, excitement and comedy. Tarantino is an absolute genius to have created this, it is a film that you can never tire of. All of the actors give outstanding performances, even Tim Roth and Christopher Walken who barely appear, but manage to make a mark. Samuel l Jackson is so good as Jules and so funny, and Uma Thurman is mesmerising. I can see why this won best original screenplay, as the dialogue is absolutely spot on!

It isn't great because of only one of these things, but they all contribute to the quirkiness and coolness of the film. Not one moment of the film is wasted, everything contributes to it. The silences and pauses are just perfect, the dialogue is just long enough to make you think about how much time is being spent on a certain conversation, but not too long as to seem to try too hard, like so many other films have since Pulp Fiction. This movie is far from an action movie, and it is not a comedy, despite it being quite hilarious throughout. It is a twisted, unorthodox, and overall wonderfully directed and edited piece of filmaking that makes great use of its seemingly trivial parts as almost the main focus of the film, and uses these things to enhance the characters and the storyline. Each character gets his or her time to shine without it seeming like the film is making room for this, as Tarantino just tells each one's story in his amazing way, taking all of his perfectly orchestrated pieces, and putting them all together in the end..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Most movies, like most novels and musical compositions, have a beginning, a middle, and an end. But a gifted, creative director/writer such as Quentin Tarantino can convolute time and come out with a new kind of animal. And look what James Joyce and the stream of consciousness writers such as William Faulkner did with time in their works. Another great movie \"Momentum\" did it all backwards, starting at the end and ending at the beginning and it worked like magic. When I first rented \"Pulp Fiction\" when it was first released on VHS I watched it late at night and fell asleep right after the Jack Rabbit Slim sequence. When I awoke the story was back on the hit scene with Vincent and Jules still talking about quarter pounders and Big Macs. I thought the tape had rewound itself and so turned off the player. I didn't finish the movie until a few months later. Then I realized Tarantino was merely playing with time. In lesser hands \"Pulp Fiction\" would be too episodic, but Tarantino makes it all work. In the end we have a happy closing knowing that tragedy lies ahead because we have already seen that part in the middle.\n\nVincent and Jules have to be the most garrulous hit men ever to appear in the cinema. They are debating the difference between oral sex and giving a lady a foot massage on their way to a kill. Jules, the spiritually misguided soul, continues to rattle on until eventually told to shut up when they arrive at the cleaners. With Tarantino at the controls all this seems to fit in when the final play is made. This element could have easily degenerated into prattle.\n\nAlthough there are many other levels of interpretation, I see this film as mainly a farce filled with dark humor and pathos, not just a farce on gangster movies in general but on our brave new world, centered on urban decay, corruption, exploitation, and perversion, filled with raw sex, drugs, and violence. The relationship between Butch and his woman points to another direction of love, compassion, and fulfillment. Note also that Butch goes back to help the man who was out to kill him because his morals wouldn't let him leave Marsellus to the rapists just as they wouldn't let him throw a fight. The watch is symbolic of eternal values that rise above the glitter and garishness of the ephemeral. Going back for the watch could have cost Butch his life but it and the values it represents were more important to him. In the end these values win out. Even Vincent has moments of compassion and tenderness, especially when with Mia. Jules almost goes full circle, but the viewer is left with a feeling that he is not totally sincere in his awakening following his brief encounter with death. Butch and his woman seem to be the only two who are able to get completely free from sin city.\n\nEach decade has movies that define the era. Think of \"Rebel Without A Cause\" for the 1950's or \"Casablanca\" for the 1940's. For me \"Pulp Fiction\" defines the 90's. All the things that were wrong for America are touched on by Tarantino, yet he provides the means of escape to what America should be. The world of the 90's was almost like a cheap book, or a book of pulp fiction as such a work was called once upon a time, showing the underbelly of urban life but with a way out. There is an exit. Sartre's \"No Exit\" doesn't work here. Redemption is possible, hopefully a more lasting redemption than the one Jules claims to have discovered. All he really has is a suitcase with contents that glitter when opened. Butch has the watch with eternal values.\n\nTarantino wisely uses surf music from the 60's to highlight the gritty life of beach bums, now street bums, who think of themselves as warlords and urban supermen...but, hey, it's all pulp fiction in the end."

Centered around several people who's individual arcs all meet at the fork in the road, the film does a masterful job of developing characters and telling a story about people striving to keep and flaunt their power. The performances by the star-studded cast are absolutely stunning and are only augmented by Tarantino's whimsical dialogue, with almost a twenty-minute sequence with just Vincent and Jules talking about nonsense. Every scene only enhances the depth of these characters, providing great insight into the personalities that make up people like Butch or Marsellus by providing a window into the way they think and interact with others. Although the jumbled time-frame can cause confusion at first, it all eventually falls into place and wraps itself up in the end, making for one interesting film. Probably my favorite aspect of the film is how it treats every character like a normal human being, foregoing the heroics and the pretense of a \"primary protagonist\" - this leaves the viewer with a film where they observe the initial position of a character and watch that character go through a set of struggles completely unique (and in some cases absolutely mental) that put their personalities and beliefs to the test. All in all, this is Tarantino's best film and shows how ditching the traditional film setup creates a film with an unprecendented form, all only to aid in its success."

Cheap imitations of Tarantino's hit began to be seen, films with more stylized dialogue, harsher senses of humour usually coupled with brutal violence became much more commonplace and acceptable in the mainstream cinema. (a prime example being Tony Scott's 1993 hit \"True Romance\", also written by Tarantino) Yet if Reservoir Dogs was a hit, than Pulp Fiction was something entirely more, snatching up the prestigious Palme D'Or award at the Cannes film festival and making a huge smash impact on movie viewers and the film industry on the whole, spawning generations of cult followers and would be imitators.\n\nDespite the relentless praise Tarantino and his most prized film have been awarded, upon viewing over a decade later, Pulp Fiction still manages to intrigue and fascinate, with its blinding originality of narrative, and wonderfully convoluted screenplay. No matter how terrible or disgusting the myriad of characters on display here, we never fail to be utterly fascinated by them, and after the movie has run its two and half hour course, we are left only wanting more darkly comical and fiendishly interesting pulp tales to feast our eyes and ears upon. One also remarks on how deeply the movie has permeated modern pop culture simply by noticing all of the scenes that are referenced, whether it be by the Simpsons, Saturday Night Live or other movies, such scenes as the 50s dance scene with Travolta and Thurman,the \"you know what they call a quarter pounder with cheese in France?\" scene with Jackson and Travolta and Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames being bound and gagged by red rubber balls, only by seeing the movie will one truly understand how often it is referenced by so many sources.\n\nThe movie truly defines the meaning of the term \"ensemble cast\" as well, with superb and incredibly memorable performances all around. John Travolta is great as spaced out, almost child like Vincent, who seems constantly on a different page as all surrounding him in the role that single-handedly re-ignited his career, and breakout star Samuel L. Jackson is similarly terrific as his partner with a tendency for religious rants, fully deserving their Oscar nominations. Tarantino favourite Uma Thurman is also terrific as a spoiled mobster's wife, and Bruce Willis gives an excellent, engaging performance as 40s style boxer Butch. Then there's the myriad of excellent supporting players, with such familiar faces as Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, Amanda Plummer, Tarantino himself... even a tiny cameo from an unrecognizable Steve Buscemi as Buddy Holly the waiter in the wonderful 50s dance club scene, and Christopher Walken delivering his utterly unforgettable monologue, one of the best and most memorable of all time.\n\nAll in all, it goes without saying that Pulp Fiction is a modern classic of film-making, and despite all of the hype and endless praises, one still walks away from it remarking on how unique and wonderful a film it is. For those not deterred by the strong violence, frequent swearing and racial slurs that tend to be Tarantino trademarks, Pulp Fiction should qualify as a \"must see\", if only to understand all of the references in modern pop culture and see what everyone is talking about. Rest assured you will almost certainly not be disappointed.\n\n-10/10"

It effectively combines smart original dialogue, wildly entertaining plot lines and many memorable characters. This movie is Quentin Tarantino at top form,delivering what is his greatest film to date,and one of the best films ever made. I will say that I am not quite sure it deserves the number 5 spot on the IMDb top 250 list,not because I don't like it but simply because I think that there are better movies out there. But to get back on the subject this is an amazing film. It is stunning in its brilliance and a joy to watch. It can also effectively switch moods at the drop of a hat. Sometimes it plays like a buddy comedy,other times it is dark and extremely suspenseful.I will say that the only complaint I could ever see thrown at this movie is lack of emotional involvement or feeling. I get this way with most of Tarantino's work but with this film I really didn't care. It is just sheer brilliance,imaginative film making and excellent entertainment. An absolute must see"

Containing a bunch of great Hollywood actors, one of the best sound tracks around and arguably the greatest dialogues such a movie could offer (e.g. the foot massage talk, Willis in the cab, all of Keitel's lines) this Tarantino work is simply a masterpiece. The cast is extraordinary, without exception. Pick Walken as the vet, Tarantino as the worried yet clarified husband (nearly unbelievable if you consider him playing the perverse, violent Richard Gecko two years later), Willis as the lucky boxer and so on. I can't help myself - reflecting about the movie just makes me adore it even more (if that's possible). Probably I just haven't seen it often enough to somehow satisfy me yearn for Pulp Fiction."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was very impressed with Pulp Fiction, upon seeing it for the first time recently. Right down to the nitty gritty: Pulp Fiction specializes in sharp and darkly humorous dialog which builds up almost unbearable suspense, culminating in sudden violence. In particular, Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta provide a nearly endless supply of memorable quotes (most of which can't be repeated in polite company). The plot itself is rather fragmented, but fairly easy to follow. The violence can be brutal (in particular, one headshot results in a bloody mess all over a car's back window), but is much more toned down than in Kill Bill, and is relatively infrequent. Unfortunately, the movie whole-heartedly embraces some things that viewers might find offensive. Male Rape makes a brief appearance, as well as an implied torture (which we never see), explicit drug use, and an F-bomb count that I swear exceeds the total number of minutes in the movie.\n\nIn the end, though, Pulp Fiction ends on a positive note, and doesn't leave you feeling unhappy and dirty. It's a thrill ride from beginning to end, and a brilliant one at that."

I wanted to see if Tarantino was something beyond of what some told me as \"a pig of violence\" And indeed, the film is packed with guns, bullets and drugs all around, but all that is passed and accomplished by its mere feel. All movies have a feel, but there are few that set a standard like Pulp Fiction. A movie that, after watching, leaves you confused, punched and dizzy, with a dried throat and a big black smile on your face. Not even God knows how Tarantino did it, he created a new kind of black humor, and a touch that was later used in many ways, for other big ones like Anderson's Boogie Nights. This is one that I'll remind, it seemed to me like the kickoff point for so many other great stuff I had seen before, and it has make me see violence and blood in another way: If I hear twist I think John Travolta and Uma Turman, if I see a hand watch I see Bruce Willis, and I say to you all: I will never ever forget the \"Royale with cheese\" scene!!

        "review_detailed_main": "Describe Pulp Fiction in one word: impossible. Because it's impossible to describe it one word, so I'll use many: a complex, interwoven modern day fable with characters as colorful as an Alice in Wonderland rendition. This film, on the surface, appears to merely be an exploitation flick, mindless in its execution and gratuitous in its violence. On the contrary! The violence, while shocking, serves the purpose of jolting us out of our everyday life - it speaks to us, and ABOUT us, in ways that your average Hollywood popcorn movie can. We get to see the humour in murder. Injected with black as night humour, it tells the tale of a group of criminals \"behind-the-scenes.\" We see their everyday conversations, fueled by intellect, wit, and poetry, debunking the stereotype that murderers are devoid of any real intelligence. Pulp Fiction is a film for the ages.\n\nIn all honesty, I gave this film a low score because it's ridiculously overrated. Personally, I can't stand hearing QT's pretentious dialogue and the \"look-how-cool-I-am\" style really grates on my nerves. It's pretty popular to like this movie, so maybe I just have to hate everything popular, but that's obviously not the case, so...I don't know what it is. Mass brainwashing and hysteria over this egotist that likes to write himself into cool parts in his films so he can suck women's toes?"

Sure, it has speed, weird characters and slick lines and stories all over the place. For me weird isn't always good as there is no red line, no real story to follow. I don't even find this movie very cool even though it might be worth a watch just cause it's like no other movie. But the story, the substance of the movie is very thin. Tarantino is for me not a very good director. Sure, some of his movies are OK, but mostly he overdo it on many occasions, which makes it hard to takes them seriously. It's no real drama, no action, no thriller, just something put in a blender it seems. If u want a true story, a movie with substance and an experience richer after wards, this is not a movie to get anywhere near."

Completely disjointed and unrelated stories that come together to form one whole that is a wonderfully told story. This movie would have fallen flat had it not been for the amazing cast and Tarantino's fantastic script. While some of the dialog is completely random its also what gives the movie its wonderful depth while still retaining its simple nature.\n\nThe cast of characters are great and filled with personality, but what really makes them come to life is the amazing actors portraying each character. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson both deliver stellar performances and play perfectly off of each other. Bruce Willis plays his character to perfection in what I would consider possibly the best performance of his career. Uma Thurman and Ving Rhames both have very strong and great performances as well, but the first three are who really shine in this film.\n\nPulp Fiction is also the landmark movie for non-linear story telling. What Tarantino tried in Reservoir Dogs he perfected in Pulp Fiction. Its probably the inspiration for most if not all of today's modern non-linear films. Among Tarantino's many great films this is by far his best. Pulp Fiction is a masterfully done and brilliantly simple movie that was is and will always be remember as one of the best films of all time."

It confronts these heavy subjects with dark humor and a self-awareness that challenges traditional genre conventions.\n\n\"Pulp Fiction\" remains a landmark in cinema history, praised for its innovation, audacity, and lasting impact on popular culture. It continues to captivate audiences with its unforgettable characters, memorable scenes, and Tarantino's singular vision, solidifying its place as one of the greatest films ever made.\n\nSo, if you want an entertaining but clever movie this is the one you are looking for .

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw this for the first time today. And whilst I cannot say I loved pulp fiction, it is extremely difficult to criticise. I gave it a 10 rating purely for its quality; it deserves nothing less. It was my curiosity to know 'what the big deal is?' that led me to finally see it. And whilst i'm not qualified to say that the film was a turning point in cinematic history, redefining its genre and such, it is undeniably an excellently executed film. If film-making could be eloquent this would be a prime example. As one reviewer pointed out, the story did not need to be told, but none-the-less it is given such style and energy and...pizazz that it feels worth it. The word 'pulp' does full justice to both its definitions.\n\nPerhaps to someone who has experienced enough cinema pre-pulp fiction, it could be seen as a slap-in-the- 'this is how you tell a story folks!'. It shows that you can take characters that the audience usually treats as one-dimensional plot devices/illustrators and turns them into the 4-dimensional complex beings that they are. The characters can no longer be construed even in the loosest sense as 'good' or 'bad' and I don't think it particularly matters. People aren't good or bad; that is what makes them complex and interesting and most importantly - human.\n\nThe dialogue is sharp, well-timed and original. A lot of the spoken word conversations are extremely ordinary in content, but they have the ability to make you think. It is the sort of observation you would usually keep to yourself rather than say out loud, almost as if the characters don't think before they speak. The acting of course is flawless as one would expect with the great slew of well-used talent.\n\nI could not recommend this film to anyone but a true film enthusiast - it is a fine piece of art with a 'devil may care' attitude. Too cool for school but smart enough to know its boundaries.\n\nI am certainly curious to see what else Tarrantino has to offer."

        "review_detailed_main": "OK, I loved this film. LOVED IT. But it's not perfect. The main problem with the movie is that the best scene is at the beginning: the histerical what? conversation. This scene comes very early in the movie, so you would expect that the rest should equal or top that perfect scene. And while the movie is always interesting and has some other moments of great humor, it never reaches the greatness of that scene. Compared to that incredible scene, the rest of the film is a disappointment. That wouldn't be a problem if the scene had been left to the end, but since it's at the beginning....\n\nPutting that aside, this movie is so original. The characters speak a lot. In many movies, the characters only speak the necessary to advance the plot, and the action is given more importance. However, in Pulp Fiction, characters are given the chance to talk, as we talk in everyday life. As a result, the characters seem incredibly real and we care a lot about them. The non-linear structure is another plus. It's a very intelligent way to grab the audience and not letting go. At times the movie gets a little boring but you never lose interest because you always want to know whether the movie will move forward or backwards. Movies that play with time always work. Well, most of the time, at least.\n\nWhat about the acting? My personal favorite was Samuel L. Jackson. But everybody did a good job including Quentin Tarantino as the guy who helps the guys hide the body but is afraid that his wife might arrive and discover the whole deal. Uma Thurman was also great at portraying that strange woman who apparently likes to play with people's feelings, knowing that they're afraid of her, because of her husband. John Travolta was my least favorite. He was too inexpressive for me, although, perhaps he did that intentionally because the character required it.\n\nOverall: 9/10."

No where near comparable then Goodfellas, Scarface, Godfather or Casino. Only a few jokes like Bruce Willas and Ving Rhames in their worst nightmare. This is more of a comedy gangster related movie like Lock Stock and two smoking barrels. That was funny."

        "review_detailed_main": "What is Pulp Fiction about? On the surface, it is about several unique people and how their lives connect in some way. The cast of characters includes a boxer (Bruce Willis), two gangsters (John Travolta), their boss (Ving Rhames), and his wife (Uma Thurman). The whole movie consists of several small stories that all connect to each other. One of them involves the two gangsters trying to get rid of a dead body and clean up the mess they've made. Another situation has Travolta taking his boss' wife out on a date, her overdosing on cocaine, and him trying to find a way to save her life. There are other story lines that I won't give away because part of the fun is seeing how everything comes together. But the story is not told in chronological order. It jumps back and forth between stories in a way that would normally be confusing, but the brilliant screenplay makes everything flow nice and smooth.\n\nIf you like to look at movies for their meaning and artistic value, then you could say that Pulp Fiction is about how people have lost all meaning and value in their lives. Instead of having individuality, people define themselves by what they see in pop culture. The movie has endless references to pop culture and it seems that everything in the movie is inspired by some aspect of pop culture. This is not a lack of originality, but a way to show that everything we do is inspired by something or somebody else. A perfect example is when Bruce Willis' character, Butch, is talking to a Hispanic cab driver who asks him the meaning of his name. He says, \"This is America, honey, our names don't mean sh*t.\" To me, the meaning of Pulp Fiction is that each moment has its own priorities. Something might be important to you at one moment in time, but in another not important at all. One minute you could be racking your brain over what you are going to say in your next Facebook status update, and the next you could have a gun in your face. People think they know what is important to them until something else happens that completely changes their priorities. Take, for example, the part where Butch Coolidge sees the man who wants him dead. At one point, they are trying to kill each other, and suddenly one is trying to save the other from getting raped by some psychos in a gun shop. When it is all said and done, they don't even care about why they were fighting in the first place because something bigger and more important is happening.\n\nOne of the things that makes Pulp Fiction great is that if you don't want to think too much about the deep, philosophical meaning to it, then you can just enjoy the movie for what it is-a humorous, violent, and stylish portrayal of several characters and their encounters with one another. It has a little something for everyone, and the more times you watch it, the more you begin to understand and appreciate it.\n\nThe genius of the movie comes out in its dialogue. Everything the characters say has meaning or it foreshadows something that is going to happen. For example, when Travolta and Jackson are talking, Travolta says that in France, a quarter pounder with cheese is called a \"royale with cheese.\" Soon after, when they are about to do a hit on a few college kids, Jackson asks one of them about the hamburger he is eating. He then uses the \"royale with cheese\" line on him, which leads to one of the funniest conversations in the history of movies.\n\nThe Academy-Award nominated performance by Samuel L. Jackson creates one of the coolest, funniest, and greatest characters ever. Despite how crazy the whole movie is (and how ridiculous his hair is), we never get the feeling that he is acting. He makes us think that he is a real person and truly believes everything he says. It is very exhilarating to watch how he starts off as a mob hit man with little meaning in his life and transforms into a deeper, more self-aware person.\n\nPulp Fiction is not only the best movie of the '90s, but it is one of the greatest films of all time. Whether you like hilarious comedies, violent action thrillers, or a deeply absorbing drama-you can enjoy it. The first time you watch it, don't try and think too much about it; just watch how the plot unfolds and everything comes together. Watch the funny conversations between Travolta and Jackson, the funky dance scene with Travolta and Thurman, and all of the other moments that make Pulp Fiction a truly memorable movie.\n\nhttp://franklinreviews.blogspot.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "What can one say about Pulp Fiction, that hasn't already been said about it? One of the best action films ever? No doubt about that. A masterpiece? Said thousands of times. Quentin Tarantino best film? Said even more. One of the best of the '90s? Been said even more again. It's one of those all-around great movies. Everything from the directing, writing, acting, editing, soundtrack, humour, even the set pieces \u0096 the adrenaline shot, the \"Bad Motherf*****\" wallet, and of course the much-documented suitcase (the contents of which we never find out) \u0096 is flawless.\n\nThen there's the classic characters. The two bickering hit men Vincent Vega (a career-resurrecting performance by John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (a hilariously unforgettable Samuel L. Jackson), their boss's sexy wife Mia (Uma Thurman), the desperate prize-fighter, Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) and the two clumsiest bank robbers ever put on film (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer), all of them enjoyable. Travolta, Jackson and Thurman were all nominated for Oscars for their performances.\n\nThis was the movie that changed the face of indie films forever. But ultimately it's Tarantino's movie. He is responsible for putting all the elements of it together to form one massive and enormously enjoyable ensemble piece. His direction is outstanding and his screenplay \u0096 one of the best ever written \u0096 is even better. With great character development, wild action scenes, brilliantly inspired dialogue and memorable conversations between the characters involving everything from robbing restaurants to foot massages to the names of European hamburgers, it's no wonder why it won the film's only Oscar.\n\nThrow in some clever editing, a typically Tarantino '60s and '70s soundtrack, and fine cinematography \u0096 the single shot of Jules and Vincent walking through the foyer of an apartment building is a highlight \u0096 and you've got yourself a masterpiece, one of the best movies of all time.\n\nLet's face it, Pulp Fiction is most certainly not one to show to the kiddies (the F-word is used an unbelievable 271 times throughout its 2 1/2 hours, and that's just for starters) or to watch with Grandma (the rapist scene is not for the faint-hearted), but that only makes it even more of a guilty pleasure.\n\nIt remains the crowning achievement of one of the most daring and individual film-making talents to come out of the '90s.\n\n10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "The one thing that really makes this movie stand apart from all other movies is not the gratuitous violence, nor the philosophical issues it raises, not even the dialog. We've seen all that before in one movie or another, though perhaps not as powerfully combined as in this movie. The one thing that REALLY makes this movie stand is how much fun it is to watch it. EVERY SECOND of the movie is incredibly entertaining. Every of the several story lines is captivating, novel, unusual, and, quite simply, interesting. How can I ever watch conventional blockbusters after this movie?\n\nSome of the great precious things for me in this movie: the watch-in-rectum story, a disgruntled suburban asking his good old friend Jules who has just brought a dead body into his garage whether there was a \"dead n***er storage\" sign in front of his garage, the foot massage discussion, the thought of what will happen to Zed, Wolf's knack for solving every possible problem, the Quarter Pounder discussion (by the way, its true; you CAN buy beer in movie theaters AND in Mc Donalds in Europe) and of course the initial shootout. Watching the soon-to-be-dead guy tremble in fear as Jules skillfully leads the discussion (\"breaking his concentration\" at times) is so much fun.\n\nThere is a lot to be said also about the style of the movie. The dialog is of course legendary, and every line in the movie is infused with significance. While all characters really do seem like they are out of a comic book they all exude style. This makes their every action, as I said before, fascinating.\n\nThe movie is quite violent. Even though the violence is stylized, it is depicted with scary realism and its full consequences, unlike action movie violence. When a guy's head gets blown off, we see it in all its glory, including our main heroes trying to \"pick up the pieces\" for the next hour or so. This is perhaps also one of the few movies that had the audacity to show a male-on-male rape and afterward the victim, having gotten the upper hand over the assailants, seething in anger and desire to extract unimaginable revenge, despite his calmness. Unlike in action movies, everyone is scared ****less when their lives are at stake, even though a sharp line is still drawn between the main characters of the movie and \"cannon-fodder\". This is also one of the few movies the \"n\" word is used so often, most of the times with just the right energy to have a hilarious effect. Quentin, in my opinion, rightly says in an interview that every time a word is given such a power, one should shout it out from the rooftops until the power goes away.\n\nAnyway, here's to Quentin remaining a prolific director for a long time in the future!\n\nBy the way, if he ever decides to make a Big Kahuna franchise, he would be a millionaire. Those burgers looked real tasty!\n\nRating 10/10\n\nScale: 10 MASTERPIECE, 9 Excellent, 8 Good, 7 OK, 6 Adequate, 5 Average, 4 Mediocre, 3 Poor, 2 Bad, 1 HORRIBLE"

        "review_detailed_main": "Quentin Tarantino presents his masterpiece: interwoven tales of a washed-up boxer, some bodyguards to powerful crime kingpin, and others who cross their path on this fateful day. Featuring an all-star cast: John Travolta in his best role (relaunching his dead career), Sam Jackson in his defining role (still trying to outdo himself fourteen years later), Christopher Walken, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth and more. (Many of these being Tarantino regulars, who work well with his idiosyncratic style.) How do I review a film so many people have praised, including my hero Roger Ebert? I could be a detractor and say its a bad film, but I'd be lying. I love the story and how it all plays out. I still prefer Tarantino's \"Reservoir Dogs\", but this comes in a close second. (Sadly, I don't think he ever recovered after he became famous. Subsequent films -- \"Jackie Brown\", \"Kill Bill\" and \"Death Proof\" -- all have a certain charm to them, but are not close to being on the level of \"Dogs\" or \"Pulp\".) Although I've seen this movie, or at least bits of it, a dozen times, I think the most recent may be the most interesting. I watched it with a young woman who saw Bruce Willis and asked who he was. I said, \"Bruce Willis.\" She asked who that was. I listed a few of his bigger films (\"Die Hard\", \"Armageddon\", etc.) but she said she had not seen them. How a woman in her 20s does not know Bruce Willis or any of his movies is beyond me, but it got me wondering: would \"Pulp Fiction\" be a different film if I didn't recognize the majority of the actors? Walken, for example, appeals to me because he's Walken. Would his monologue be as good if delivered by someone else or by Walken when I didn't know him by name? Curious thought.\n\nIf you haven't seen \"Pulp Fiction\", see it. Tarantino is a better writer than a director, but this film offers probably his best directing to date and some superb writing. He is very dialogue-intensive, which I think alienates some viewers (particularly in \"Death Proof\"), but give him a fair shake. This film defined the 1990s and continues to be influential in film today. Pay attention and you'll be sure to see why."

I mostly found it very funny at times, the way these mean gangsters act like regular people. For example, Vincent and Jules are calmly discussing the level of intimacy a foot massage implies right before they go inside an apartment with guns to teach some twenty-somethings a lesson. However, when all is said and done I felt as if there should have some point to the movie. The only characters who evoked any sympathy were minor characters. I will confess I totally loved \"The Bonnie Situation\" sequence, but it was way too short in comparison with some of the rest of the movie. I wish the whole movie was that light-hearted or had expanded the story out for two hours. On the other hand, I was almost bored during the story about Vincent taking Mia to the restaurant. Overall, it was a good movie, but the quality changes throughout."

The editing is interesting in that the film is told out of order and the audience has to see it more than once before they can start piecing it together. The directing is fantastic, as per usual with Tarantino. Further following an early Tarantino trend, he casts himself in a small role and as usual, it a terrible actor. Don't let Tarantino's poor acting deter you, the rest of the cast is amazing. Pulp Fiction is thought to be the film that brought back John Travolta's career, but there is much more than that. Nearly the entire cast are legendary actors. Furthering the Tarantino tradition, \"Pulp Fiction\" has an amazing soundtrack. There is nothing bad that I can say about this film. It is honestly the closest thing to film perfection that I can think of."

I'm from Barcelona and I don't speak English very well, but I will try to write the best that I can. For me, Pulp Fiction has one of the most important scenes of the movies history: The twist. It's the best dance in a movie and the most important. And for me it's also funny because they're drugged, and their expressions and faces are incredible. A lot of people says that Quentin is crazy. Well, it's probably, but all genius are a little crazy\n\nThank you\n\nDon't hate me for these words"

I personally think this is the film that made Samuel L. Jackson as this crazy badass. This is simply Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece that needs to be watched if your a movie lover. Definitely one of the best films of the 90's, and deserves to be in anyone's movie collection cause it just ain't one without this. This really is a true original, some complain that this film is a bit overrated but let me tell you this deserves to be overrated. Yeah sure there is no deep message behind this movie, but who cares.\n\n9.4/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "This Movie is one of last century's biggest achievements. No exaggerating. To make a winning masterpiece, you have to be special. Is master Tarantino special? Tell me about it. People find themselves in Pulp Fiction and remain in awe of its stunning style, a work of art that wins in all areas. This is not my favorite movie ever, but I admit it's the most powerfully and creatively made among what I've seen.\n\nNot everybody will completely understand Pulp Fiction, Not that I claim I'm superior to many, no, the point is you have to know Tarantino to 1.enjoy and 2.figure out this movie quite well.\n\nThe long and rich dialogue sequences, the unique close-ups, the usual tribute to the history of Cinema, the captivating violence and finally, the innovative style of the picture should be visible only to those who know the young phenomenon to an enough extent.\n\nThe first time I saw it I was like, \"This must be great but I've not gotten the message\". The second time that happens to have happened a few minutes ago made me understand that THERE IS NO MESSAGE, a fact that per se was enough to convince me this one is a top-10 on my list.\n\nTarantino is many young director-to-be's idol. He's got a gift, his works contain what many liked and seriously tried to insert in their films but couldn't. If Scorsese has one live rival to be able to compete with him, then it's none other than our man.\n\nTravolta and L.Jackson are in my opinion the best pair ever in the history of Cinema here and the supporting roles are acted to perfection. You can't imagine this movie without the presence of Thurman, Keitel or even cameos by the likes of Arquette and Z.\n\nTarantino is a film lover/freak and you can sense it in each and every moment of his works, so make sure this title is the first one you'll watch after reading my review because I'm telling you, you'll love it."

There's plenty of drama in the three different stories that are occurring simultaneously. There is a good amount of action, and a little bit of comedy intertwined. I would recommend this movie to anyone, but children, unless drug use and violence offends you. Pulp fiction is a must see. You really see how amazing these actors are. I love Uma Thurman's performance, she really got into the role and perfected it."

But it also shows some of the most disturbed, dangerous and cruel personalities that I could imagine still having trances of humanity in them.\n\nWhile reading some of the \"I hated it\" comments I can't stop from remarking that what they are saying is true. Of course sodomy, sickening drug use, useless violence, accidental shootings and filth of the language are not amusing. And frankly speaking the characters are build using especially the utterly pointless dialog, the coolness of their looks, the idiotic jokes that so many mistake for attempts at comedy. Those are the characters.\n\nAlso... if you think art is about telling you a story just like the ones your mama used to read at bed-time... think again. Art is about feelings. Not about stories. I have yet to see a great book/painting/sculpture/music/film that is about the story. Sure, the story is there. But it does not matter were it takes you, what matters is what leaves behind.\n\nYes, this movie is not entertaining, it is not nice, it is racist and it is degrading. And it is so to the point were you actually ask yourself... can this be happening? Can this be real? And then you are just saying to yourself \"I'm so glad it's not my reality...\""

        "review_detailed_main": "Quentin Tarantino is a storyteller. With \"Pulp Fiction\" he demonstrates some of his favorite story features, like portrayal of a violent subculture and a cast of colorful characters. As the film tells us at its start, the pulp fiction genre is characterized by the lurid-a word that can mean merely colorful or extremely sensational. His films often border on film noir, but unlike most noir, there is a pulpy depth of character development that comes from extended dialogue.\n\nExcept for a brief detour into a seemingly unrelated sub-story, the film begins with Vincent (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson), two men on the way to an unknown assignation. As they drive along, they discuss continental differences in language and culture. They philosophize openly and reveal significant aspects of their life views. When the viewer eventually realizes the nature of their outing, there is incongruence between their casual demeanor and the significance of their errand.\n\nTarantino serves up his characters with heaping slices of humanity that undercut the judgments one might make if he was not privy to their internal systems of logic and morality. He reminds us that the old actor's precept is true: all people/characters believe they are justified in their actions.\n\nVincent and Jules are not the central characters throughout the film. The story meanders in a non-linear way and indulges in detours that appear to be unrelated, but Tarantino has his eye on the entire, relevant whole. Though he may indulge in flights of fancy simply for the fun of doing so, he has a cohesive vision. Those flights of fancy are some of the most enjoyable moments in the film, like the restaurant called Jack Rabbit Slim's, where Vincent spends some time with the wife (Uma Thurman) of his boss. It's a restaurant that anyone might want to visit, filled with entertaining design elements and colorful people.\n\nAs in at least four other films before, Tarantino puts Travolta on a dance floor and capitalizes on his ability to deliver memorable, if not iconic, performances.\n\nTarantino gives us dialogue that is richly quotable. No wonder so many fans enjoy his films.\n\nTarantino is definitely an auteur. His artistic vision is as recognizable as Hitchcock's or Woody Allen's. \"Pulp Fiction\", for reasons I have mentioned, is like a primer on how to engage an audience and take them on a journey. This is a film classic that will, no doubt, inspire other writers and directors."

Everything about this film is annoying, (the presence of the ubiquitous Sam Jackson and Steve Buscemi, the weak attempts at shock value, the cameo by the director) but the one element that makes this number one on my all time worst list is the obnoxious dialogue that tries to be hip and funny. THREE'S COMPANY reruns have better dialogue (and I hate that show). It's such a shame though, because QT and I do have a lot of the same obscure tastes in movies. My advice is to try a project that tries not to be shocking, funny or hip, because PULP FICTION fails in all three departments miserably."

The cinematography is awesome and the whole look of the film in general is an experience to see. The really cool thing about this movie is that its shot out of chronological order. The scenes are completely all over the place. They do not go in order. Its different and could confuse you but i was still able to pick up on the movie and what was going on because all though none of the scenes were shot in order they all connect to each other a little bit in a way. I think that the way its shot out of chronological order makes the movie awesome and unique. I've seen a number of movies shot out of chronological order but this one is the best in my opinion. Im not lying when i say everything about this movie is a freaking trip! Its got an insanely good cast starring in it and it has a lot of violence. Love this movie. Tarantino never disappoints me."

I loved it when I saw if for the first time back in 1994 with my then 13-year old son in the theater, and I loved it again when I saw it last weekend on TV. Every time I see it, it seems to get better and better. I am fascinated by the incredible pace, witty dialogs, and brilliant writing - every piece of the puzzle falls in the right place, and in the end I don't care a bit about the mysterious case. \"Pulp Fiction\" is a glorious example of the fact that there is no low subject for Art.\n\nIt is amazing how a work of art can consist of so many trashy elements, which is alluded to in the title of the film. It is populated by characters that came from the pages of cheap \"pulp fiction\" novels - gangsters, philosophical hit men, drug addicts and drug dealers, dangerous and sensual mistresses, naive girlfriends, crooked prizefighters with hurt prides and prized golden watches with long and deep histories. Tarantino and his co-writer Roger Avary took the clich\u00e9s of hundreds of films, comic books and twenty-five-cent paperbacks and by magic of their talents turned them into something fresh, sparkling, clever, funny and incredibly enjoyable. I should mention Tarantino's taste for music - the soundtrack for \"Pulp Fiction\" (as for all of his films) is just killer. And last but not least - how well Tarantino works with his actors, in this film everybody shines. There are no bad performances in \"Pulp Fiction\". For me, it is a perfect film and a true source of joy, one that I've experienced dozens of times and am always ready for again.\n\nI've read many times on these boards that \"Tarantino is a rip-off artist\", that \"he takes bits and pieces (not influences) from other movies.\" I often think of him as of a young boy who loves to play with his toys. For him, the toys are the old movies that he adores and he brings his love and admiration of these films to his own work. He is not greedy; he invites us to share his love, to play together, to have as much fun watching his films as he did while making them. Tarantino does not make profound statements or ask eternal questions, but what he does do is entertain, and he does it marvelously - with style, class, irony, wit, and talent. When I am in the presence of a great work of art I know the feeling, and Tarantino's film is a great work of art that happened to be very enjoyable. I cannot resist. Like any time of day is a good time for blueberry pie, any time of day and any day of the week is a good time to watch and enjoy \"Pulp Fiction\"."

Who else could write three attractive totally different stories, and get them together into a thrilling 3 hour movie that will not even allow you to breathe?

A boxer, Bruce Willis, just before a fight in which he's asked to lose. Two thieves, Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer, deciding to rob a restaurant. Take these three stories, put them together in a bowl, and shake as much as you can. Result: a brilliant film. A big-size puzzle that will make you think.

This was an enjoyable film with a pretty plain and raw film style. Lots of long shots to witness the chemistry between characters. Cool soundtrack too."

Mind you, it's not a terrible movie, it has style and memorable moments, but nothing THAT great that justifies the hype among these pseudo intellectuals. You know the type: these college kids who just love Pulp Fiction and Fight Club, probably jerk off to Bukowski's poetry, think Kubrick is THE GREATEST DIRECTOR OF ALL TIME, absolutely LOVE to bash religion and make sure everyone knows they're an atheist, and yet still manage to think they're better than you. The sad thing about Pulp Fiction is that I used to enjoy it when I was younger, wasn't my favorite movie of all time, but was definitely on the top 10. Watching it now, having endured thousands of these guys and their egos, left me bitter and annoyed. I realized that I didn't even speak all that much about the movie, sorry about that, I'm just salty."

Also, while we were watching it, I was cracking up at the language - I can't even count how many curse words they used. This is one movie that will probably never get shown on network TV - they would probably have to cut more than half the movie (including Samuel L. Jackson's wallet).\n\nAll in all, director Quentin Tarantino created a real masterpiece here. Top-notch acting (that spawned some famous lines) and a great script combined for a real treat. Uma Thurman's scene might make some people's skin crawl, but if not, then enjoy."

The film is a non-linear narrative that weaves together multiple storylines, each with its own unique cast of characters and distinct style.\n\nTarantino's direction is masterful, with his use of music, dialogue, and camera work creating a distinctive and unforgettable cinematic experience. The film is filled with memorable scenes and quotable lines, from Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield discussing the merits of a Quarter Pounder with Cheese to Mia Wallace and Vincent's iconic dance sequence.\n\nThe performances are outstanding, with John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson delivering career-defining performances as the hitmen Vincent and Jules. Uma Thurman is also exceptional as the enigmatic and alluring Mia Wallace, and the supporting cast, including Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Bruce Willis, are all excellent.\n\nPulp Fiction is a bold and audacious film that takes risks and breaks the rules of conventional filmmaking. It is a film that rewards repeat viewings, with each viewing revealing new layers and hidden meanings. The film is a testament to Tarantino's talent as a writer and director, and it remains one of the most influential and important films of the modern era.\n\nPulp Fiction is a film that demands to be seen and experienced, a bold and unforgettable masterpiece that will continue to inspire and influence filmmakers for generations to come."

Voting, cheering and stamping your feet for talentless and retarded actors, musicians, artists etc. That is why this world goes straight down the toilette. Making your modern remarks that everything is so \"Cool\" all the time.\n\nPulp Fiction is at best a bad joke from a below average director. There is no inventions, no good or natural acting, no deeper meaning with this movie at all. Just exploitation.\n\nThe era of good movie-productions are long gone. Classic actor's like Chaplin, Bogart, Cooper, Peck, Holden and Quinn don't get born any more. Today it's just you gray and unpersonalized people out there (With some exceptions), watching to see if there's something that can kill your brain even more, with splatter and gore above your ears.

        "review_detailed_main": "Pulp Fiction was released back in 1994, and now, nearly twenty years later (as of 2013), Tarantino's first real masterpiece can still be compared to some of the crime movies of today. Critically acclaimed across the world, we are presented with four interweaving stories about mob hit-men, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and a couple looking to rob a diner, and it deserves it's acclaim.\n\nQuentin Tarantino's first film, Reservoir Dogs, was a word of mouth success. Little was known about this raw, raunchy crime thriller from an unknown writer/director, but it became a cult classic quickly. Therefore, his follow-up film needed to be good, and he delivers.\n\nAnyway, on to Pulp Fiction. The Academy Award-Winning film contains four interweaving stories. They are gritty and foul-mouthed, but truly spectacular. Only few times have writer/directors been able to pull off such astounding films. Without dipping into spoilers, I can safely say that Pulp Fiction is like a dive of a cliff for first-time Tarantino viewers. You think it's risky attempting it, but when you do, you're hooked. It's this film that truly made Tarantino who he is today, and it's this film that can still stand the test of time, one of the rare few.\n\nPulp Fiction is a masterpiece I can't wait to watch again. A truly spectacular film on all levels. A beautiful crime drama that accurately dips you into the crime world in ways we've never been dipped before, and I can't wait to get dipped again.\n\n10/10"

        "review_title": "With a rare authorship and an easily identifiable style, Tarantino, already at the beginning of his career, consolidated himself as one of the main creative minds of his time",
        "review_detailed_main": "Set in Los Angeles, the story brings a series of events where violence and the criminal underworld go hand in hand. Among the main stories told, we have gangsters Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and his partner Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson), boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) and mob boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) and his wife Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman). All the characters are somehow related. However, this is just a preface to the unbelievable plot that Tarantino develops.\n\nOnce again, the filmmaker remakes, in his image, the referred resource of non-linear montage, something he had already outlined in his first film, but which, here, is part of the structural foundations of the narrative progression. We see some great unquestionable classics like \"Citizen Kane\", \"Rashomon\" and \"Annie Hall\" who have ventured down this path, with undeniable success, but with a very personal style of the director, but which was only really possible thanks, again, to the impeccable work of his late longtime partner Sally Menke in the editing room.\n\nSee, for example, the time jump that Tarantino makes in the middle of the film, when we see little Butch (as an adult, the character played by Bruce Willis) receiving a visit from Captain Koons (Christopher Walken), who had lived with his father when the two were prisoners of war. This whole scene, which tells a story only with a long monologue by Koons in a unique long shot, which does not deviate from the character, aims to demonstrate to us the importance of Butch's father's watch. This happens right in the middle of the interrupted narrative that Tarantino imposes on us, but when the flashback happens, we accept it naturally, without being surprised or without even for a moment failing to understand what is happening. Today, we might find this obvious and unimaginative, but try to transport yourself to 1994, when Tarantino released Pulp Fiction at Cannes almost as an experimental work and received a standing ovation for long minutes, walking away with the Palme d'Or.\n\nThe dialogue, in principle, is detached from the action: the henchmen discuss snacks and foot massages, this on the verge of forcibly collecting a debt. However, exactly in this opposition - followed by attraction - between speech and event, lies one of the greatest assets of \"Pulp Fiction\". The somewhat nonsensical staging of Tarantino, a filmmaker accustomed to mixing genres, giving them a pop look and giving the pastiche a paradoxical originality, embraces almost to perfection both the types given to verbiage before and after killing, and the subtexts that are not rancid and seasoned with irony.\n\nWho can forget the twist danced by Travolta and Uma Thurman, she, the wife of the mafia boss, that is, who he can't think of touching for fear of jealous reprisals? And what about the injection of adrenaline whose effect is to \"resurrect\" the same woman, rescuing her from the land of the dead by overdose? \"Pulp Fiction\" advances out of chronological order, packaged by, perhaps, the most expressive and functional soundtrack of Tarantino's career, composed of hits such as: You Never Can Tell, Girl You'll Be A Woman Soon, Son Of A Preacher Man, among others. In the scene in which Butch (Bruce Willis) listens to the plan to deliver a certain fight, for example, Let's Stay Together, a well-known romantic song, plays, here serving as a sonorous and, therefore, dramatic counterpoint to the dismayed face of the impotent boxer in the face of the cruelty of the world and his own weakness.\n\nEach of the narrative lines that populate this film in episodes of Tarantino is riddled with dialogues that function as an expansion of what we saw in his first work. While his first film had dialogues that were limited to the same circle of people composed of gangsters or bank robbers of Caucasian origin, in Pulp Fiction we see a profusion of different characters in a duo dynamic (or almost): the couple of amateur robbers who opens and closes the film (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer); assassin duo Vincent Vega (John Travolta, revived by Tarantino) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) on a mission; crime boss Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) and boxer in the twilight of his career Butch (Willis) encountering rapists Zed (Peter Greene) and Maynard (Duane Whitaker); Vincent Vega and Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) dealing with a heroin overdose and drug dealer Lance (Eric Stoltz) and his wife Jody (Rosanna Arquette) and Vincent, Jules, Jimmie (Tarantino himself) and the \"resolver\" of problems\" Mr. Wolf (Harvey Keitel) dealing with a nasty situation involving blood and brains splattered in a car. Tight or semi-tight stories sewn together by a single theme in a film that tells them out of order, but brilliantly connects them.\n\nEach dialogue is carefully tailored to work with your character and the respective interaction with the other character. There's a bit of everything, in addition to Tarantino's incredible ability to insert pop culture mentions at every turn. The phrases about the small differences between Europe and the United States, about the \"medieval acts\" of Marsellus over Zed, about the quotation from the Bible that Jules uses before killing and several others are, if you like, as empty of content as they are full of meaning. Of rhythm; or as full of social criticism as we choose to imagine, but not forgetting that many of them are taken - some word for word - from previous works in yet another demonstration of Tarantino's ability to remix what already exists and transform it into something of his own. The result is entry of all of them and more into the general culture of moviegoers (who often don't even know they are quotes of quotes) and casual viewers alike. And all this married with a surgical choice of songs for each moment, each situation, in an anthological soundtrack, perhaps the best of its kind, in yet another amazing demonstration of musical curation by Tarantino.\n\nIn \"Pulp Fiction\", Tarantino inserts quotes, dialogues and situations that bring direct relationships or allude to elements, mainly, of pop culture. Among the director's influences are Western films, as well as other noir films, such as \"Band \u00e0 Part (1964)\", by Jean Luc Godard. This, in this case, inspired the dance of Uma Thurman and John Travolta. Other movie references are displayed when Butch chooses a weapon to return to the basement. The hammer is related to \"The Toolbox Murders (1978)\", the baseball bat in the best style of \"Walking Tall (1973)\" and \"The Untouchables (1987)\", the chainsaw to \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974)\" and \"The Evil Dead II\" and, finally, the sword, the chosen weapon, makes analogy to several samurai films. In addition, the mixture of long dialogues with explicit violence makes the plot even more interesting, as well as the suspense created around the stories, which are gradually revealed. Still, some elements are fraught with uncertainty. This is the case with the suitcase of the mobster Marcellus. After all, what was in that briefcase? This is really a mystery, Tarantino himself said that its content is not of great importance, what matters is to whet the public's curiosity and give continuity to the plot. This type of resource is used in some audiovisual productions and is known as \"MacGuffin\", a term created by filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nThe more we unravel the timelines of the film, the more attached to the narrative we become. In this context, we observe the cycle between past and present, like the story of Butch and Captain Koons. Here, we follow Butch's troubled origins and draw a \"justification\" for his actions - not that this cancels out the character's responsibility, nor does it romanticize him. The question is, first of all, to understand the causes and consequences of the acts of the represented types, through acidic dialogues and remarkable flashbacks. After all, the construction of the figures is so careful that it is difficult to fully demonize or humanize the characters.\n\nIn direction, Tarantino focuses excessively on the expressions of the figures that make up his work, turning the minimum into maximum detail. The actors' body language, for example, is extremely valued here, through frames that facilitate the connection with the audience. \"Pulp Fiction\" offers a true festival of unforgettable scenes. Perhaps most remembered is Vincent Vega and Mia Wallace's dance, but there's also Jules' speech before killing his targets, the talk of uncomfortable silences, the controversy over how sexual a foot massage is, and much more. The filmmaker uses and abuses symbols that strengthen his objective and, essentially, the development of the narrative, through an obscure, tense and challenging scenario. About the performances, it is valid to point out the incredible harmony between the cast. Interpreters of Mia and Vincent, and exhaling overwhelming chemistry, Uma Thurman - Oscar nominated for supporting role - and John Travolta steal the scene and masterfully defend their characters, raising the level of both to another level.\n\nNot behind his colleagues on the scene, Samuel L. Jackson - also nominated for an Oscar - stands out brilliantly with his Jules and turns him into the best performance in the film, being valued as he deserves. A golden trio.\n\nWith a rare authorship and an easily identifiable style, Tarantino, already at the beginning of his career, consolidated himself as one of the main creative minds of his time and, although he was not the precursor of the tools he uses, the familiarity with which he travels through the various possibilities that the audiovisual offers make clear the reason for its outstanding position among peers. Remembering 'Pulp Fiction' as his best work is far from being a consensus, but it was a watershed for a successful trajectory and a milestone in the history of cinema."

Everytime it came on when I was flipping through channels, when that was a thing, I ended up watching it till the end from that point. Every scene is a delight. And the music, man, the music is perfect to a tee!\n\nMaybe the best Tarantinofilm, and that is saying a lot. And the movie that really put him on the map, after the low budget \"Reservoir Dog\" made him a young director to watch. And watch him we have. Set the tone for what was the 90s movies.

What Tarantino does, in essence, is create an entire world. This is a vast, interwoven, interacting, multi-varied facet of a criminal underworld in which we quickly find interest and empathy in vivid, solid characters. What this film conveys is a kind of charisma not only from each of these character, but from the synergy they create as a whole that can make you feel like you have really stepped into their world, into another life, and accept this \"morally ambiguous\" modern-day epic. Truly, there has not been a more enriched and wholly enthralling film to have been released in the last decade if not longer. And, lastly, on a personal level, while I do not believe that this is the ultimate masterpiece of film history, it is personally my favorite film, and was the defining film that has lead me towards a career in the film industry. So obviously, it must have something going for it."

Nothing in pop culture comes close to replecacting the quintessential brilliance of the tight script wonderfully acted film that just flows so well. Q.Ts most powerful directoring achievement is his second film. Not only does it launch stars but it gives life to failing stars revetlising failing acters and giving them a shot of life who would go on to command bigger salaries in bigger budget movies. Unlike Quentin's latter movies that have much more bigger budgets and bloated runtimes the modest budget used on pulp fiction helps the director to sculpt a script and runtime to perfection within the limited budget. It's a masterpiece and lots of films have tried and failed to replicate the Quetin standard formula of his first two movies but failed terribly."

Some may know Tarantino as the screenplay writer for TRUE ROMANCE or the writer-director of the critically acclaimed RESERVOIR DOGS, and just like those previous efforts the heart of PULP FICTION lies in Tarantino's brilliantly written conversations among the various characters. Dialogue fuels PULP FICTION to vividly show the contemptible lives of each character. Tarantino has the gift of propelling the movie along through the spoken word, whereas lesser creators might rely solely on action, violence or special effects. You should note that the movie is shown in a non-linear time structure reminiscent of the critically acclaimed independent film MYSTERY TRAIN, but this should not be an annoyance because the movie is basically a series of three related vignettes that individually add up to one great movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Pulp Fiction, arguably the most iconic movie from culturally iconic filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, is an exhilarating ride that combines comedy, drama, violence, and a nonlinear narrative. Featuring some of Hollywood's most remarkable talents, like John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and Bruce Willis, this film delights with its dark humor and edgy cinematography.\n\nPulp Fiction follows several intertwined stories involving a mid-level hitman Vincent Vega (John Travolta), who takes orders from his mafia boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Accompanying him is Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson), his colleague and comic relief who brings wisecracks and quotable lines to every scene. They are tasked with recovering a briefcase of mysterious contents stolen by two small-time crooks working for Marcellus Wallace- Honey Bear (Quentin Tarantino) and Pumpkin (Tim Roth). We soon learn that the case holds tremendous importance as it contains items that could potentially destroy Marcellus Wallace's reputation if they fall into the wrong hands.\n\nFurther complications arise when Vincent Vega takes Marcellus Wallace's wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out for an evening adventure at Jack Rabbit Slims diner, where they compete in a twisting competition before she overdoses from drugs prompting Stoltz's memorable line, \"She was brought here by YOU; thus YOU inserted the needle!\" Meanwhile, Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) is another criminal who must take a risky detour back to his apartment with Maria de Medeiros as his innocent girlfriend to retrieve an important family heirloom-a wristwatch passed down through generations-and Christopher Walken as the grizzled war hero ready to exact revenge on Butch should he fail to comply with his demands.\n\nTarantino has crafted a masterful script richly detailed in dialogue that captures humor and drama more powerfully than any other writer/director today. His collaboration with Roger Avary has yielded one of the most memorable scripts in recent memory, filled with characters that simultaneously evoke laughter, sorrow, and empathy unlike anything else. It often feels like Tarantino himself inhabits these characters throughout their various plot points as he explores themes of morality in crime fiction while simultaneously poking fun at them.\n\nPulp Fiction features dazzlingly kinetic cinematography from frequent collaborators Robert Richardson and Andrzej Sekula, which exquisitely captures both the frenetic energy of an urban underworld filled with criminals but also creates moments of interiority amongst its inhabitants which allows us to see them not just as criminals but human beings too whose lives we can understand even if we don't condone their actions or lifestyles. This combination of frenetic visuals coupled with heartfelt emotion makes for one electrifying experience that sticks long after you've watched it.\n\nWhat makes Pulp Fiction so special is how Quentin Tarantino manages to slyly explore moral grey areas without becoming preachy or sacrificing entertainment value either; it exists somewhere between spectacle and philosophy while giving its viewers room to come up with conclusions on their own terms while still asking more critical questions about life itself, especially when it comes to morality in crime. The casting is also top-notch, featuring some of Hollywood's best, from Travolta and Jackson to Willis & Thurman, all delivering career-best performances that reverberate years after its original release date making this one movie worth watching again & again! 10/10."

It's one of a select few films you wish you could watch again for the first time, but watching it for a second, third, eighth, tenth time... it still feels fresh and still makes you laugh.\n\nThe casting is just spot on, and the performances across the board are so memorable, even the bit-parts. I have watched this so many times I could probably recite the entire dialogue with a high degree of accuracy. As many a good film I have seen I would be hard pressed to state a better script, I can't think of many, if any lines of dialogue that don't need to be there. That is an outstanding achievement. On top of this there's also the awesome soundtrack, when I first saw this I can't say I had heard any of the tracks before, subsequently it was one of the first soundtracks I bought the CD. As with Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino's choice of music was incredibly effective for the vibe of the film.\n\nThere is some violence but it is not gratuitous and adds to the story. Now stop reading this and go watch it."

No, they go down on certain movies and up on others, as in, more cgi and oddities... and less acting, sure, I aint saying that CGI does alot, but if you take the Christian Bale Terminator one, that was spoiled, however, the upncomers, be it in a different timeline etcetera... and sadly, actors do grow old, yup, however, Arnold as old, that was a stinger splash right there, hit the sweet spot, same goes for movies like Pitch Black series or the Jeepers Creepers ones.... Horror usually never finds its way into peoples heart, yet I saw one today that totally blew me away, can only hope that Quentin brings this man fourth into the light. (obviously talking about who directed it, etcetera) Since its kinda like the 'lighthouse' which is just insanely good also for being a suspensful, strange, surreal movie... just odd that Daniel Day Lews isnt in it, but then again, considering that Willem DaFoe did such a job, doubt they would've needed DDL. Not saying I'm not a fan, I am, same with this fine and very humour driven actor named Christoph Walz(t?) who's by far blown me and my fellow movie lovers away with his performances and from what i've gathered, using research and such, quentin was the man who found another nugget, heck, he could probably make anyone shine, just cause he's that darn good, plus i love that he loves old school cinema too, them robert rodriguez flicks he made, grindhouse, death proof etcetera, just shows how much he's evolving from golden oldies like this, insanely great movies.... and just cause its from 1994, dont let it fool ya, it will leave any youngun who thinks a movie has to have Michael Bay blowing stuff up for 9 hours non stop, gasping for air after watching a viewgasm like this. a Hundred pints raised from a Tiger born in the sign of Leo, ex-spetznas alfagruppe #1733 Batallion, greetings to imdb and much love to anyone who loves a good movie, cheers from Chris/Sweden."

However, I do have a disliking of Quintin Tarantino, I hated the Kill Bills and I just don't like Quintin Tarantino as a person. I feel like the movie lacked motivation and moved slow until the last twenty minutes. There were several plot gaps that left me hanging and the twisting story line that was supposed to be theatrical was just stupid and unattached to any part of the movie. The only saving grace for this film was the fact that it had an all star cast. I'm sorry if you disagree and you all probably will but this movie JUST SUCKED!!!"

With so many lines which will be repeated long after you see this movie, it is pretty much an instant classic.\n\nI've seen Pulp Fiction more times than I can count (Probably about 50) and it's the only film that I can still get joy out of after seeing it that many times. I was terribly confused as to what transpired the first time I saw it, but then after a few more viewings I began to realize the genius in this film isn't that Tarantino makes the viewer understand the film, he makes the viewer love it. From the \"Big brain on Brad\" scene until the \"Bad Mother F--ker\" scene, this movie aims to please. In that sense it is probably the anti-classic, but since we already have a surplus of sex, drugs, and violence in film and on television why not just roll them all into one, multiply by one hundred, and make a movie out of it.\n\nUnfortunately this will probably be Tarantino's last great film judging from the pathetic aftershock which turned out to be Jackie Brown."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's crazy to think how I've never seen Pulp Fiction until a few days ago. It's crazy how it's one of the last Tarantino movies I've seen and the fact that it still holds up is mindblowing.\n\nPulp Fiction is a collection of four stories that interwine which include a boxer, two hitmen, a gangster and his wife and two bandits.\n\nThe amazing part of Pulp Fiction is how brilliant each scene and each character is. Each scene has iconic written all over it. I thought the film was going to be overly violent but that's not the case. It's just characters talking but it's the dialogues that make it so engaging. Seeing John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson talk about cheeseburgers and foot massages for a couple of minutes make them feel like ordinary people rather than just hitmen. There is a feeling of realism between each character interaction. It's something moves steadily without losing momentum at any given point. Then you have characters that only appear for a short amount of time like Mr. Wolf and they have such a huge and memorable impact on the film. If this isn't Quentin Tarantino's best screenplay, I don't know what is.\n\nAnother aspect that caught my attention was the excellent soundtrack. It's no surprise for a Tarantino film to have great song choices and placements but there's something about the songs in Pulp Fiction that work so well with each scene they're embedded into. It's absolutely perfect. The film's narrative is very interesting as it goes back and forth with each chapter. Each chapter, by the way, is fantastic. All of them are filled with terrific moments and iconic scenes that makes it difficult to lose interest. If that wasn't enough, the performances will surely win you over. It's great to see John Travolta and Bruce Willis give stellar performances especially after seeing them in the films they're currently doing. Samuel L. Jackson has never been better and the rest of the extraordinary ensemble cast are at the top of their game.\n\nI love seeing filmmakers express their love for cinema within each of their films and Tarantino has been consistently doing that, creating memorable movies his entire career. Pulp Fiction will remain his masterpiece for years to come. Now that I think of it, it's no surprise how well Pulp Fiction holds up to this day. After all, it is a timeless classic."

The humour was spot on evoking laughs at the most inappropriate times which I loved. The soundtrack, spectacular, and what I believe is a major reason the film became the cult classic it did. Perfect for every scene. The leads Travolta and L. Jackson had standout performances, however all performances were great. Tarantino has done an excellent job at creating an authentic and raw film, giving the impression of a rough and unfinished first edit, whilst keeping you entertained and glued to the screen for every minute. 10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Pulp Fiction\" is a 1994 American crime film directed by Quentin Tarantino, and it's widely considered a cult classic and a landmark in independent cinema. The movie features an ensemble cast, including John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Bruce Willis.\n\nThe film consists of several interrelated stories that are presented out of chronological order. The nonlinear structure of the movie allows for a unique and unconventional narrative that keeps the audience engaged and guessing.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of \"Pulp Fiction\" is its sharp and witty dialogue. Tarantino has a unique talent for crafting memorable and quotable lines that stick with the viewer long after the movie has ended. The film also features an excellent soundtrack that complements the narrative and adds to the overall atmosphere.\n\nThe performances in \"Pulp Fiction\" are outstanding, with each actor delivering a memorable and nuanced performance. Travolta and Jackson are particularly noteworthy as the hitmen Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield, respectively. Uma Thurman also shines in her role as Mia Wallace, a character that has become an iconic figure in popular culture.\n\nOverall, \"Pulp Fiction\" is a well-crafted and thought-provoking film that has left a lasting impact on cinema. Its unconventional structure, memorable dialogue, and exceptional performances make it a must-see for any cinephile. However, it is worth noting that the film contains graphic violence, drug use, and strong language, which may not be suitable for all audiences."

        "review_detailed_main": "Cinema is not like rock and roll, but once or twice in a generation someone will come along and try to reinvent cool for the screen. In our generation, just such a personage is Quentin Tarantino, a writer-director who raised the snappy, witty dialogue of the gangster genre to the level a cunning art. Pulp Fiction is arguably his signature movie.\n\nIt has a screenplay of perfect construction, full of symbolism and tiny elements that play off one another throughout the two-and-a-half hour runtime. As with Tarantino's debut, Reservoir Dogs, the dialogue is a continual complement to the action, in contrast to cinema's usual actions-over-words ethos. There are actually often more words then are strictly needed, for the sake of rhythm or emphasis, such as Uma Thurman saying \"five, as in there's 1-2-3-4-5 of us\". One of the best things about the Pulp Fiction screenplay is that, though ostensibly a gangster movie, it's also very much not. There is much of the mundane aspects of criminality, such as Lance asking his wife for baggies and twisticks, and the irony of hoods relying upon a cleaner and an underworld medic for things they got up to when off-duty, as it were.\n\nTarantino's style as a visual director is, for the most part, beautifully simple. In an era where edits seem to come every two seconds, Pulp Fiction features some refreshingly long takes. It's a very minimalist style \u2013 he doesn't show us anything we don't really need to see. During the Kahuna burger exchange, he breaks it down to just two opposing but contrasting shots, a close-up of Samuel L. Jackson and the mid-shot of Brad with Jackson and Travolta before and behind him. Some scenes open with just a series of close-ups, and for much of the movie, sets and scenery are barely noticeable. This puts the focus totally on the actors, something that is all too often forgotten in the more showy, technical movies of the modern age. That's not to say backgrounds never matter. Once in a while there is a brilliant something-or-other to be noticed, like the game of Operation in Lance's house, standing out amid the dull-coloured bric-a-brac for a second or two.\n\nThe reams of dialogue and this attention given to actors puts a burden on the cast that has similarities to that in a stage play. And as with classic stage acting the performances here are certainly exaggerated, a kind of heightened version of reality, albeit a world away from theatrical hamming. Uma Thurman particularly stands out, sparkling with energy and delight, and a flirtatious frisson with an also-impressive John Travolta. Michael Madsen was the original choice for the role, but Travolta has a somewhat softer approach that is just right. Finest of all though is surely Samuel L. Jackson, who has this brilliantly menacing stillness, contrasting with a rhythmic, shifting tone in his words. Jackson is to Tarantino what Laurence Olivier is to Shakespeare; he can speak the lines as if he's actually thinking them.\n\nMy only problem with Pulp Fiction is it's sometimes too clever for its own good, filled with too many embellishments, too many attempts to be outstanding and different. There are some moments that just seem almost twee in a way, like when Thurman's \"square\" is literally drawn on the screen. But by-and-large Pulp Fiction is a work of much filmmaking genius, and it's hardly surprising that creativity as vibrant as this will come bubbling through the seams here and there."

Old but good, and Samuel Jackson and John Travolta are really very entertaining in this movie. In addition, the story is told in a very unorthodox style. The characters are developed, but not overly so. The dialogue is great to watch and the action is typical of this kind of move. The story is a good one, complex enough to keep interest but not too complicated like other films can be. From beginning to end, he has you interested. The themes of the movie are very different in nature from one and other but come together very nicely in the end. I know this might not be insightful, in anyway, but it is truthful, I personally really enjoyed this movie. But who am I to say."

I had seen other films by Tarantino before watching this one many years ago we will say 10 years ago when I was a teenager. And people here and there would mention the title pulp fiction to me and not sure why I just didn't bother to watch it till it was free on demand with comcast and was finally left in awe pondering the meaning of life for probably 30 minutes afterwards with the tv turned off. The dialogue is what sells this film along with the acting. And there are those that claim it is ultra violent and while there's some moments it's nothing like some of his others. The acting is amazing and I realized I wasn't watching a movie it's truly just an experience. This is the type of movie where you don't pop it on with a group of friends or a loved one just hanging out, it's meant to be observed, listened to, digested. There's no way to describe the plot or put it in a genre. It exists on its own. This was the movie that made me realize how important and impactful dialogue can truly be. A film doesn't need to be flashy, have crazy special effects, action every 2 minutes."

It is long before the film takes off to a new never before level of movie making the visual brilliance of the scenes and stories The intertwining of the different tales into each other the choice of order and the eventuality of being let back to the beginning makes this for me one of the all-time greatest films and from the very first viewing knowing this is going to be one of the worlds greatest directors. so many amazing performances career defining roles for stars at the top of there games actors aided by an amazing script. which still to this day is timeless like Reservoir dogs before it how to tell when it was supposed to be set what year? which just helps to make the film still perfect 30 years later. Stories could've just as easily be made into three four five maybe even six movies instead what you have is it beautifully mix intertwining timeless tales told by a master who's love of cinema is all over this movie."

If someone wants to sit down in front of a tv after a exhausted day and wants to watch something to lighten his mood , then this is a perfect movie for you my friend .\n\nThis movie is technically good too. The way Tarantino wrote a clever script and tied his audience with a movie with such an ordinary story, is really impressive . The acting, humor, violence and use of music is top notch.

The photography of this movie is also amazing, very well planned in a way which brings all the atmosphere of the entire movie. The characters are amazing super well acted by this super list of cast. About Tarantino's direction, there nothing that I can tell ... in my opinion this guy is a genius with enough sensibility to put the audience on the right climax, at the right moment.

Wood Jr., proclaimed the Worst Director of All Time, he's in love with every shot - intoxicated with the very act of making a movie. It's that very lack of caution and introspection that makes \"Pulp Fiction\" crackle like an ozone generator: Here's a director who's been let loose inside the toy store, and wants to play all night.\n\nThe screenplay, by Tarantino and Roger Avary, is so well-written in a scruffy, fanzine way that you want to rub noses in it - the noses of those zombie writers who take \"screenwriting\" classes that teach them the formulas for \"hit films.\" Like \"Citizen Kane,\" \"Pulp Fiction\" is constructed in such a nonlinear way that you could see it a dozen times and not be able to remember what comes next. It doubles back on itself, telling several interlocking stories about characters who inhabit a world of crime and intrigue, triple-crosses and loud desperation. The title is perfect. Like those old pulp mags named \"Thrilling Wonder Stories\" and \"Official Detective,\" the movie creates a world where there are no normal people and no ordinary days - where breathless prose clatters down fire escapes and leaps into the dumpster of doom."

        "review_detailed_main": "Most people I know who have seen this movie either think it's the best movie ever or the worst piece of trash ever produced. I happen to fall in the middle. I enjoyed this film, though not immensely. I found it funny, which actually kind of disturbs me in a way. Should it be funny when someone accidentally gets blown away? Yet I found it to be. Still, I think the extreme amount of violence got to me, since it mostly did not have much of a point; it is really only the one scene of violence that I thought was amusing. I thought the Bruce Willis storyline could have been done without, instead focusing on Travolta and Jackson. Instead, the \"story\" meanders and seems largely without purpose. Despite that, though, it was still an enjoyable film. I recommend it as long as people realise what they're in for, and don't just watch it because of the hype surrounding it; when someone expects perfection and they don't get it, they tend to over-compensate and react more negatively than they otherwise would have, and end up giving this film a 1 instead of the 5 they might have given it had they not been shocked by the content.\n\nI give this film a 6.5, mainly for the dark humor. This movie is not for everyone. Don't watch this movie with blinders on, and hopefully it will be worth the 2 hours and (possibly) the $3-4 you spent to rent it (although in Canada, I know you can watch an unedited version of it on Showcase- that channel is great for films they can't show on the networks without such severe editing that part of the story is lost). The other thing I liked about this movie was the characters themselves; Tarantino is very good at taking what would from the outside seem like despicable, inhumane creatures and making them human. While I don't know how many hitmen are actually nice guys, it is nice to see films sometimes that have normal people doing bad things, instead of just evil, rotten, flat characters. This film is thus a good character study, for those interested in the workings of the human mind."

There is nothing groundbreaking about this movie, the dialog is boring, the characters have no depth. It seems like it was made on a 24 hour deadline and they had plenty of spare time to go back and add an \"F\" word anywhere there was a space.

Quentin Tarantino blows us all away once again with 1994's \"Pulp Fiction\" with Oscar nominees Samuel L Jackson, Uma Thurman and John Travolta. Despite the scenes being in a mixed up time order, this is one every college student should have in their DVD collection. There are some scenes in which you can't help but laugh, even though a serious point in the film. I won't name any right now, because this is a SPOILER FREE REVIEW, PEOPLE! COME ON! But anyway, Pulp Fiction is sure to have you dying for more! The only thing I have wrong with this movie is Jules' Bible passage, which (despite being FRICKING BRILLIANT) does not appear in the Bible. But that doesn't matter, it's a brilliant film!"

The director of this film is usually not one of my favorite that could possibly be why I do not enjoy the movie as much as other people have it was a well made movie with lots of great acting and lots of famous actors and actresses. A lot of the story just made no sense to me on why they would do certain things or why they were acting in certain ways that they were like I said this movie was not for me but I know many people out there have really enjoyed it throughout the years."

Pulp fiction is truly fiction \u2026and Quentin Tarantino (one of my favorite directors) has crafted this masterpiece to bring a bit of everything into it. There was no movie and there won\u2019t be any movie that can be made in the same fashion as Pulp Fiction. It sets a class of its own. It is undoubtedly \u2018one in a million\u2019. The acting is superb, the screenplay unmatched, the script engaging and the direction could not be any better. Violent and real, it brings life onto the screen in the first five minutes. This is one movie I would see in the theatre again \u2013 if were re-released that is. But *sigh* we have to get used to the DVDs now."

He succeeded quite nicely.\n\nHowever, many his fans are trying to make it more than what it is, a cool but undemanding movie. While it's refreshing compared to typical banality supplied by mainstream Hollywood, it's far from a truly great classic some fans want people to believe. Interestingly, that's probably not Tarrantino's intention in the first place"

And the worst thing is that there's not motherfreaking plot! I watched the whole film and did not understand what the hell is going on. I cannot think of any positive things about this film.\n\nAnd why is this film loved by many and get thumb up from the critics? Here's some of my theory: 1. this is a very unique film for its time, so people get on a bandwagon and start praise this film, so whoever hate this film would considered \"uncool\" 2. Pulp Fiction is so bad that it's good. As mention before, pulp fiction is a unique film, it's so unique that it's hard to tell that it's good or bad, but the critics decided to call it good, soon a bandwagon start.\n\nthe bottom line is, do not watch this film, don't care about what other people say. If this comment doesn't convince you to stay away from this film, then go to page 5,6,7,8, there are other people who just hate this film as much as I do"

        "review_detailed_main": "What is the big deal with this movie? The movie SO boring, uninteresting, and full of a bunch of moronic and trashy characters. I just don't get why people like this film so much. It truly saddens me that this film has, for some god-awful reason, made it into IMDB's top 250 (and currently top 20). This film is most definitely in my bottom 250.\n\nHere are some of the many problems I had with this film:\n\nThe scene where Bruce Willis' character was first introduced is one of the most visually painful scenes I've ever seen, I was ready to turn the movie off right there. The camera just sits there on Bruce Willis' face and doesn't move for what seems to be an eternity. What on earth was Quentin thinking?\n\nThe best way to describe this movie is \"just a bunch of STUFF\", there's no real plot here and the story doesn't go anywhere? I found it really hard to give a SH*T about any of the characters, and I couldn't care less if any of them got shot or killed.\n\nWhat was with that scene where Uma Thurman's character says \"Don't be a square\" and she forms a little square with her hands (If you haven't seen the movie then you won't know what I mean)? That was so STUPID!!! I just don't get stuff like that. Too weird for me. ...And people call this a comedy? Where the f&*k is the comedy? Is it supposed to be funny when they go over the speed bump and shoot the guy in the back seat? That isn't funny, that's SICK! The only part that I laughed at was when John Travolta and Sam Jackson were talking about eating pork/bacon. I thought that was a pretty funny conversation, but other than that I didn't find the movie funny at all.\n\nI'll never say \"don't waste you're time\" while referring to a movie, cause everybody has different tastes. So if you feel so inclined, go ahead and watch it, but I HATED it. I hope you enjoy it more than I ever will. Thanks for putting up with my ranting and raving,\n\n-Chris"

The dialogue is probably the best part of the film, you could tell from the opening scene alone that this is no ordinary dialogue and no ordinary movie.\n\nGood stuff, kept me entertained for the full 2hr 30m run time.

        "review_detailed_main": "After opening his film-making career with the violent, gritty 'Reservoir Dogs' Quentin Tarantino followed it up with 'Pulp Fiction'. Told with a similar, non-linear storyline the latter follows the criminal lives of many characters, some of which intersect by coincidence. Tarantino's style of film-making is often incoherent, messy, and just plain obnoxious. While one can praise his entertainment factor, it's not good enough by itself to make a remarkable film. Such is this case with 'Pulp Fiction' which often relies too much on clever editing, smart acting, and foul language.\n\nThe film starts off with two lovers talking in a diner: Pumpkin (Tim Roth) and Yolanda (Amanda Plummer). As they discuss previous criminal jobs, they suddenly decide to hold up the diner they're in. After they get up with guns, declaring their intentions the film goes to freeze frame and the opening credits role. To describe the entire plot of 'Pulp Fiction' would take too long, and is unnecessarily. It follows the lives of two hit men named Jules and Vincent (Academy Award nominees John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson), a Mob Boss (Ving Rhames), his oddball wife (Uma Thurman), and a boxer at the end of his prime (Bruce Willis). Intertwined among these criminal characters are a myriad of different personalities. There's the twisted Zed, the classy Winston Wolf, and of course Tarantino himself as Jimmy. These characters often come together through different segments and numerous situations. They include a desperate trip to recover a sacred Golden Watch, a case of someone very important overdosing on Heroine, and a botched getaway from a job. The cast is impressive, featuring smaller roles from the likes of Steve Buscemi, Eric Stoltz, and Christopher Walken. While Tarantino has an impressive cast list to boot, other elements of the film often go wrong.\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind in Tarantino's films is dialog. He works a labyrinth of different personalities, characters, and events while connecting them with one common theme. The main interaction in 'Pulp Fiction' is violence. It is sporadic, but it comes in bursts of graphic nature. There is, like in 'Reservoir Dogs' comedy mixed in with drama and even action. However, stylistically the combination is lacking. Tarantino ultimately has to use the f-word to establish a certain emotion or mood in his screenplay, rather than relying on directional technique. The cast emotes his dialog to their best of their abilities and the tough build of Jackson is impressive. He gets into his character and fully embodies the hit-man who grows a conscious. The rest of the cast are solid, but Jackson ultimately carries the show with his hilarious delivery and tone.\n\nTechnically speaking, 'Pulp Fiction' doesn't accomplish anything new. There is interesting editing by Sally Menke, although the photography by Andrzej Sekula looks dated. A good deal of Tarantino's filmography deals more with more with the \"sound\" than the \"look\". There is a fun soundtrack thrown into the mix, but everything looks fairly standard as intended. Tarantino's direction feels off base, mainly because the material he gives himself doesn't really go anywhere. 'Sin City' is an example of a film that is purely based on style and looks, while Tarantino as a filmmaker tries to get a combination of intelligence and entertainment. As these two heads collide, things get messy. Does 'Pulp Fiction' really do anything new for cinema? There's quite a bit of swearing, yes, and the film is looked up to as something out-of-this-world but these are not striking elements. In 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1' Tarantino once again heavily copies from other Kung Fu films, but in that regard he is able to create something distinctly entertaining and visually exuberant. The characters in 'Pulp Fiction' are degenerates, people who kill for a living and people who use drugs regularly. Tarantino has made personal remarks that he condemns this sort of behavior, yet the film stylizes both these elements as if there is a bigger mystique to them then there really is.\n\nIn the end, I give 'Pulp Fiction' more than it's fair share of points. It entertains and it has some solid acting-Tarantino's (lack of) ability to really pull everything together for a solid point ends up being his wrongdoing once again.\n\n6/10"

Kiss Me Deadly was full of quirky characters and had a mysterious chest which contained a glowing object. The main difference in style was that the humor in Kiss Me Deadly is much more subtle, while Pulp Fiction is trying real hard to get a laugh or a reaction. Because of that, I feel that Kiss Me Deadly is the far superior of the two."

It has an adolescent aesthetic and some of the dialogue could be from an early draft of Clerks, yet it is just so irresistibly \"cool\". Travolta and Samuel L Jackson in matching black suits; Harvey Keitel as Mr Wolf (now ruined thanks to Direct Line); the dance in the diner; Ving Rhames being mean\u2013 all so hip, all so enchanting, but none of it adds up to anything.And that is Tarantino's biggest flaw as a filmmaker. With the exception of the glorious Jackie Brown, all of his movies amount to nothing more than a few good scenes, while the overall narrative gets lost in his indulgence. Pulp Fiction is not a good film, though I may have believed it was in my younger, more impressionable days, when you had to like the film. On each re- watch, it lost a little more of the magic I thought was there the first time I saw it."

Pulp Fiction is a cult classic and one of the movie that will stay in the viewers mind for a long time but certainly not a popcorn movie(a spiritual movie in my opinion) . Pulp Fiction is a philosophical fiction with a tinge of humor added to it. S.L.Jackson was amazing as Winnfield and Thurman excels as Mia and not to mention Bruce Willis but I felt rather disappointed with Travolta. A very satisfying movie but not an entertaining(depends upon the way you define entertainment) one. I recommend \"Snatch\" and \"Lock,Stock..\",if you want a more entertaining movie from the same genre. My score 8/10..If you are a serious movie buff..Go for Pulp Fiction"

Give it another watch and your likely to pick up a new interpretation hidden in the existing world of this top-notch film.

        "review_detailed_main": "My Tarantino retrospective continues with \"Pulp Fiction\" a film I know well, and love. Having been slightly underwhelmed by \"Reservoir Dogs\" a few weeks back I was delighted to find that \"Pulp Fiction\" is as Iconic as ever.\n\nTold with a convoluted timeline, \"Pulp Fiction\" revolves around two Hitmen, Jules Winnfield (Samuel L Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta), who recover a briefcase for their boss, the criminal Kingpin Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Several calamities befall them as they attempt to return the case. Wallace then arranges for fading boxer Butch Coolidge to take a dive in a prize fight, when Butch double crosses him, Wallace goes after him, which has extreme and unexpected outcomes for both of them.\n\nIconic really is the only word that fits. Each scene is chocked full of quotable dialogue and legendary moments of cinema. So many sections have been parodied in things like \"The Simpsons\" and \"Spaced\", the film is a juggernaut of popular culture. The jumping backwards and forwards in time, help take what is a relatively straightforward story to the next level. There is a good time to be had just mentally putting the film together again in the correct order.\n\nVisually, it's a step up from \"Reservoir Dogs\" as the camera is much more dynamic that it was, travelling with characters through sets and shooting locations. Performance wise too it's a lot better, flush with the success of \"Dogs\" Q.T was able to keep the best from that cast, but also attract some enormous talent. Samuel L Jackson is probably the standout. . and this is probably the best performance of his career. Every line, every intonation, every eye bulge is (and here's that word again) Iconic. The music choices are fabulous - just as they were with \"Dogs\". Every song fits the tone of directly into the scene perfectly.\n\nIt's not totally perfect though. Tarantino's scenes in front of the camera make me cringe. He's not a good actor, and on top of that his use of the N-word seems a bit egregious, or that a character like Jules would let him get away with it.\n\nThat though doesn't spoil what is quite simply one of the greatest films of all time, perhaps even the only true masterpiece in Tarantino's catalogue (I'll see as I check out the rest)."

I love many aspects of the film. But it's too retro and silly. Dogs is more real and shocking.\n\nJackie Brown I feel he tried again to get the realism, but since then has simply not bothered.

I agree with one critic only when he states that the film \"presents meaningless issues in an intensely-fascinating and almost lyrical fashion\", and I would like to put a big emphasis on MEANINGLESS!!! How can something meaningless be good?\n\nAnother famous critic, Roger Ebert, claims \"Seeing this movie last May at the Cannes Film Festival, I knew it was either one of the year's best films, or one of the worst. Tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie, but he could possibly make a bad one...\" That is amazing! One of the world's most acclaimed film critics watches a 'masterpiece', and right after that cannot decide whether it is really a masterpiece or garbage? Then he goes on to say, 'oh, but it can't be garbage if such an in-director made it, so it must be a masterpiece'. So much for competent individual judgment... I suppose you would not be able to call yourself a critic if you wrote that Tarantino simply screwed up this time...\n\nIn my opinion, the film has a ton of famous actors, an \"in\" director, and nothing else. The plot is practically non-existent, there is no message, no \"higher\" meaning, nothing but violence for the sake of violence..., and above all, it does not entertain either! If this is art nowadays, I want to go back to the past!"

Jackson, & pop-music and film references reign supreme in this film. Not to mention the 'Royale with cheese' quote, and 'Say 'what' again, I dare you, I double-dare you motherf##ker, say 'what' one more goddamn time!'

The film is replete with iconic moments, like the monologue perfectly delivered by Jules Winnfield (Samuel Jackson), the twist dance routine of Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and the Mexican standoff in a diner. However, this masterpiece is not recommended for the faint- hearted, as a lot of R - rated violent scenes of great detail are interspersed in the film.\n\nThe soundtrack has been compiled quite tastefully. 'Misirlou' sets a funky tone for the film during the opening credits. Structurally, the film is divided into seven sequences, which have connected stories. As expected, the cameo from Tarantino himself as Jimmie, the distraught husband in arguably the most entertaining part of the film - The Bonnie situation - proves to be the cherry on the cake."

Edinburgh native, Optimo regular, DJ, Red Bull Music Academy graduate, refugee from rock groups such as Degrassi, Russia and American Men, and for a short period a trainee corporate lawyer, much of Turner's debut album as Claude Speeed was sketched out on a guitar and laptop while he was travel-ling through India, Singapore and Cambodia.\n\nSubsequently, this material was refined and mixed at locations including Hudson Mohawke's studio in London and Kuedo's studio in Berlin, but it would be wrong to assume My Skeleton was in any way designed for club consumption. Instead, Turner's recent FACT mix \u2013 which eschewed beats in favors of twinkling drifts and droning computer music \u2013 offers a useful signpost to My Skeleton's contents. Present here is the fluorescent Cynthy glow and ADHD maximals that's common to his peers on the LuckyMe roster, but what's within is on a dreamy, ambient tip, melding classical minimalism, post-rock, cosmic Cynthy and systems music with an eye for personal exploration and spiritual reflection.\n\nContemporary readings of such genres sometimes feel like the stuff of battle re-enactment, too studied to transcend their rich histories. On My Skeleton, though, Turner often takes pains to keep his music feeling living and breathing. 'Tiger Woods' and 'Spectral Choir' employ dancing Steve Reich patterns, but through these Turner laces weaving woodwind and ringing strings with half-heard field recordings from his travels, the bustle of a marketplace or the hum of traffic. There are songs, too: the melancholic twinkle of 'Hold On', featuring the folksy tones of female vocalist LW; or 'Taj Mahal', in which Turner takes the Mick in a manner that reminds me a little of Phil Elverum's work in lo-fie experimentalists The Microphones, his sleepy and sincere words half- buried under droning soft Xanthus and star bursts of heavily treated post- rock guitar. The title track breaks from the record's largely electronic recreations to employ a real string quartet, although thanks to pitch- shifting and diligent layering, there feels like no hard breaks between the real and the synthesized.\n\nThere is trauma here, too, albeit sublimated into these woozy folds of sound. Turner's trip was prompted by bereavement, and here and there My Skeleton takes a turn into darkness. The Dom post-rock build of 'Prove You Exist' apparently went by the working title of 'Claude Speeed You Black Emperor', while 'Some Other Guy', which vacillates between diaphanous ambiance and harder Mego-like drones, is supposedly inspired by a visit to a tower of human skulls in Cambodia's Killing Fields. In the hands of some, this might come across slightly glib, a bit Selie- at-Auschwicz, but throughout My Skeleton, there's the sense that Turner is out to honestly communicate his own experience, even when emotions are embryonic, or sensations twisted by tiredness or fever. The result is a record that keeps the sense of a human being on a passage of exploration, its internal emotional landscape porous to the influence of the tumult and chaos of the world outside."

        "review_detailed_main": "In a diner, a man and a woman who call each other Pumpkin and Honey Bunny eat breakfast in a booth. Honey Bunny teases Pumpkin for not wanting to commit armed robberies anymore, and Pumpkin explains that robbing the diner would be better than robbing convenience stores or banks. She agrees, and the two leap to their feet and draw their weapons, before the opening credits roll.\n\nAcross town, two men in suits named Vincent and Jules ride in a car discussing Europe and fast food. Jules tells Vincent that Marsellus, their boss, allegedly had a man thrown off a balcony for massaging his wife Mia's feet, who Vincent has been instructed to take out to dinner. They argue about the implications of foot massages, before storming an apartment with three men inside. Jules kills one, and recites Ezekiel 25:17 before killing another, named Brett. Vincent retrieves a briefcase, the contents of which glow, from a kitchen cabinet.\n\nIn a bar, Marsellus gives an envelope full of cash to a boxer named Butch, bribing him to throw his next match. Vincent and Jules, now wearing tee shirts, enter the bar, and Butch has a brief exchange with Vincent on his way out.\n\nIn the following scene, Vincent buys heroin from his drug dealer, named Lance, and talks briefly to his girlfriend Jody. After buying three grams of heroin, Vincent shoots up and heads to Mia's house. Mia does cocaine in the bathroom while Vincent fixes himself a drink. They head to a restaurant named Jackrabbit Slim's, where they talk about Mia's failed television pilot and the foot massage rumor, which Mia denies. Mia forces Vincent to participate in a twist contest, which they win.\n\nBack at Mia's house, while Vincent uses the bathroom, Mia mistakes his heroin for cocaine and snorts it, falling unconscious. A panicked Vincent rushes her to Lance's house, although Lance is reluctant to help. Vincent is able to successfully revive her with an adrenaline shot straight to the heart. At the end of the night, Mia tells Vincent a joke from her television pilot, which she previously refused to divulge, and the two agree to keep the night's events a secret.\n\nA man named Captain Koons visits Butch as a child, giving him a gold watch that is a family heirloom. As an adult, Butch kills his opponent in a boxing match, rather than purposely lose as Marsellus wanted. Butch escapes in a cab driven by a woman named Esmeralda, and calls a bookie named Scottie who plans to collect Butch's earnings. Meanwhile, Marsellus orders that Butch be killed. At a nearby motel, Butch's girlfriend Fabienne waits for him, and the two talk and have sex. The next morning, Butch realizes his gold watch is missing, and angrily leaves the motel in search of it.\n\nButch cautiously returns to his apartment, and initially finds no one there. He retrieves the watch and notices a gun on the counter. He hears the toilet flush, and kills the man who emerges from the bathroom, which turns out to be Vincent. Butch leaves and is spotted by Marsellus at a stoplight. Butch rams him with his car, and an injured Marsellus chases an injured Butch until both men are subdued inside a nearby pawn shop by the owner, named Maynard.\n\nButch and Marsellus awaken in the pawn shop basement, where Maynard has bound and gagged them. A man named Zed shows up, who orders Maynard to get \"the Gimp,\" a man in a full-body bondage suit who sleeps in a trunk. Zed drags Marsellus into another room to be raped while Maynard watches, and Butch manages to break free. Butch is about to flee when he hears Marsellus's cries and instead retrieves a katana sword and ambushes the men, killing Maynard. Now freed, Marsellus shoots Zed in the crotch, and tells Butch that the men are even, as long as Butch leaves town and never tells anyone about the incident. Butch rides Zed's chopper motorcycle back to the motel, and he and Fabienne ride away together.\n\nThe film flashes back to the scene where Jules recites Ezekiel 25:17, this time from the perspective of an armed man hiding in the bathroom. After Jules kills Brett, the man runs out and fires wildly, miraculously missing Jules and Vincent with his entire clip. Jules and Vincent kill him, and Jules calls the event an act of \"divine intervention.\" The two take Marvin, the only surviving man in the apartment, with them, and leave. In the car, the men continue debating \"divine intervention,\" and Jules pledges to give up his life of crime. Vincent accidentally shoots Marvin in the face, killing him. Jules calls a nearby friend named Jimmie, and they head to his house to deal with the cleanup.\n\nAt Jimmie's house, Jules calls Marsellus for help, who arranges for a man named Winston Wolfe to come over and help fix the situation. Jimmie tells the men they have ninety minutes before his wife Bonnie arrives home. Wolfe arrives ten minutes later and instructs Jules and Vincent to wipe down the car upholstery. They place Jimmie's blankets over the seat, and Wolfe hoses a naked Jules and Vincent down in the backyard, before giving them old tee shirts to wear. They follow Wolfe to a nearby auto shop, where the car is destroyed. Wolfe introduces Jules and Vincent to his girlfriend Raquel on his way out of the auto shop, and then leaves.\n\nJules and Vincent decide to get breakfast at the same diner that Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are about to rob in the first scene. Vincent goes to the bathroom just before Pumpkin and Honey Bunny draw their guns. When Pumpkin demands Jules's wallet and the briefcase, Jules draws his weapon, and explains to Pumpkin that he now understands the true meaning of Ezekiel 25:17, and wants to find a non-violent solution. Vincent emerges from the bathroom, resulting in a Mexican standoff. Jules successfully de-escalates the situation, and he and Vincent leave the diner with the briefcase in hand."

The actors in this film are especially great among all make a perfect union that raise my score.\n\nThe performances are quite correct, in my opinion highlighting the Uma Thurman, a pretty violent movie and too strong at times, is one of those films that scare even without cause tension and leaves you the willies at times. One of the things that also seemed luxury have been the musical interventions that appear, especially in which Uma Thurman dancing with John Travolta, that scene is epic, music can not be better because stick with the film, despite if not my genre I've been pleasantly surprised, just have errors, almost perfect, is not the kind of film that I usually fix although I have done and I am delighted for movie lovers this noventera wonder can not pass unnoticed."

        "review_detailed_main": "My first memory of Pulp Fiction was when I was very young, and my father had borrowed the soundtrack, and he listened to it. And I still remember listening to the beginning, Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer's dialogue, followed by Misirlou. I don't have any idea why it had such an impact on me, but I remembered that for so long. And the soundtrack of this film continues to enchant me! There are so many songs in this film that are absolute gold. I already mentioned Misirlou, but one exceptionally beautiful track is Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon by Urge Overkill.\n\nI saw Pulp fiction for the first time three years ago. I was sixteen then. But this time I did notice there were several details I missed - or have since then forgotten. It's great how you can watch a film again and it still feels kind of new.\n\nI love the colour palette of Pulp Fiction. Especially the colour red is very strong. And I have no complaints about the cinematography whatsoever, it really looks amazing. And the design of many locations is great. I especially love Jack Rabbit Slims, the 50's themed restaurant Mia and Vincent Vega go to. It looks absolutely ridiculous of course, very extravagant, but that's why it's so amazing. It's so detailed.\n\nPulp Fiction sure has it's cult classic reputation. I think almost everyone with Internet has seen pictures and GIFs of Pulp Fiction, even if they haven't seen the film itself. That's why watching the film is weirdly surreal. You know so many scenes, but when they are put together, they are perfect, even if so many scenes are legendary even on their own: Samuel L. Jackson's monologue, The dance scene. Several pieces of dialogue. They are all amazing and so many people know them, but when you see them all in a film, it's... surreal.\n\nThe characters of Pulp Fiction never seize to amaze me. Like I said about Reservoir Dogs, the characters are closer to people than devices to carry out the story. None of them is a hero, none of them is a villain. They have virtues, they have vices. Of course they are devices for the story, that's what characters do, but even when they do their job for the plot, they still have lives outside of the story. Even if the film doesn't shove their regular life to your face, you can still feel it.\n\nPulp Fiction is good. It is most definitely good, it's amazing. Of course I like to think sometimes that it is completely overrated, but whenever I watch it again - or even see an out-of-context piece of the film, I remember that it is one of the best films ever made."

        "review_detailed_main": "Quentin Tarantino is a name with which many are familiar, especially if you call yourself a movie buff. However, Tarantino seems to be one of those directors, whose material you either love or hate. For the most part, I think I'd put myself in the \"hate\" category. Neither volume of Kill Bill really appealed to me, and I haven't bothered to see any of Tarantino's other films. Any other than Pulp Fiction, that is, a film which I definitely did not hate.\n\nPulp Fiction's three greatest strengths are the characters, the stories, and the direction. Each character possesses a life of its own and each actor propels that character onto the screen in such a dazzling and eccentric way that you can't help but enjoy the action on screen. John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, and Bruce Willis, actors you would expect to see in a brainless action flick, all put in good performances. Sure, there's no powerful drama, but the interesting stories are the focus here. Each character fits his or her story, and the entertainment increases as the stories intertwine energetically thanks to Tarantino's direction. Also, unlike Kill Bill, the focus of Pulp Fiction is not mindless action, but the brilliant stories and characters themselves.\n\nNow, on to Tarantino's famous Pulp Fiction screenplay. Let me begin by saying that, for the most part, the dialogue is as interesting as the characters and the stories, providing insight into their lives. However, as with any movie that attempts to infuse comedy, it's hit-and-miss. There are several more hits than misses, but some of the dialogue in the film is so absurd, that it can't help but detract from the rest of the film.\n\nTherefore, if you're looking for a deep, profound film, then I can't really recommend to you Pulp Fiction, as, in my opinion, it's just a popcorn flick. Yet this is a smart, even brilliant, popcorn flick, and I dare you not to be entertained.\n\nFinal Grade: A."

We wouldn't have liked it, if the screenplay had been linear. Oh, and need I mention about the soundtracks? They seemed like they were composed originally for the scenes. No wonder, Tarantino got an Oscar for the screenplay! I'm giving it a 10, because the movie deserves it."

Quentin Tarantino writes some of the most entertaining dialogue there is to write between two characters.\n\nDespite its over two and a half hours long run-time, Pulp fiction does not drag in the slightest as it is basically multiple exhilarating movies rolled into one with an all-star cast that perfectly fits in Tarantino's zany universe. You actually are left wanting for more as the end credits begin to roll. Even after watching the movie more than a dozen times, I still can't remember what scene comes next. However, It's non-linear narrative structure isn't what makes Pulp Fiction a near masterpiece, its true strength comes from the excitingly fresh characters and the crazy events that take place in the film. And of course, the quirky-smart dialogue. The characters in the movie are always talking yet always so interesting. You never really think you'd enjoy a movie about the lives of two mob hit men, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and a pair of diner bandits, it all just feels so random, yet it intertwines so brilliantly. I love it. Undoubtedly, one of the most quotable movies ever and most certainly my favourite movie of all time.\n\nSo, Pulp Fiction, 10/10? Correctamundo."

The soundtrack is a classic, which you can still listen today with a lot of fun, many lines from the movie people still remember and from time to time in the regular life situations they remember them. The Coolness of some characters is unbelievable, and 20 years later it has not lost anything of his brilliance. I mean the dialogs and the characters are just tarantinostyle, he's a league for his own. Even all his movies have something special, but pulp fiction is my favorite."

        "review_detailed_main": "Plenty of people love this movie. They rave about how original, cool and funny it is. I will admit that there is a lot to see in Avary and Tarantino's script including plenty of off beat cameo roles. I really liked Samuel Jackson's character. Not only was the performance excellent but the depth of what he was dealing with was very powerful. The rest of the movie I wasn't so happy with.\n\nPulp Fiction has some original story ideas. But if you compare it to Goodfellas which also has flashbacks, slow motion and sick humor it doesn't look that original. But I will admit that the story in Pulp Fiction is done in a somewhat original way. Moving down from here we have the Bruce Willis role. It is very powerful but so graphically violent that like Blue Velvet it becomes too much after a while. Down from here we have Uma Thurman's part which I felt was filling time. I didn't think that much of Travolta either. As for the so called great humor, I did not laugh at the scene in the car which just about tells the story for me. Finally about Tarantino. If he is going to have a great career in this business, he will need to write dialogue in which every other line doesn't have the \"N\" word and also where the climax of each scene isn't filled with buckets of blood. Without the shock value I wonder if he is that good. I thought Jackie Brown was only a little above average but better than Pulp Fiction.\n\nPulp Fiction presents a few effective, original moments and has a great performance by Samuel Jackson. Otherwise it piles on the violence, blood and racial slurs hoping to shock but turning out just to be overdone."

The film wouldn't be so eerily brilliant if it weren't for the lighting effects. Sometimes the faces of the character's are 1/2 lit or lit in a different way which really helps bring the concept of being in the shadows to the screen and it manages to make that more of a profound impact on the viewers because the person doesn't look normal or like they should. Another technique that was used very well in this film was the actual film making itself. The subjects were filmed in such a way that they complement the lighting effects but still make them visible for the audience to understand what is going on in the story."

        "review_detailed_main": "Pulp Fiction (1994) is a crime movie written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. The movie tells different stories about two hitmen, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and two diner bandits. It is famous for its non-linear story, violent scenes, and dark humor.\n\nI like cinematography. I like how Tarantino captures the shots of actors in different camera shots and they maintain very good depth. The cinematography per se is rich. What is more it has very diverse locations adding more richness and depth to the movie. It's just great. The cinematography is simple and effective and it's not over exaggerated with any unnecessary transitions and rapid camera movements. It goes with the flow. That is why in my opinion the movie is 2h 35min long. The movie tries to make the movie \"feel\" the movie. I love the camera movements during the dramatic scenes, it's just unique. The whole pace of the movie is slow since it also tries to showcase the character development in the movie and more dialogue focused.\n\nThe screenplay is interesting. It has some witty lines and dramatic sequences and vice versa. It's a unique blend for this movie. I also like the romantic relationship development in the movie. I like how the story is separated into 2-3 different stories with its own unique focus and later those stories come together. The plot gets more complex and explicit, and the film itself is utterly insane. A Grand Theft Auto (GTA) vibe infuses this film.\n\nThe acting is very good, especially the character development. Accents are clear. The acting feels very genuine and I especially like the dramatic scenes seeking solutions while being emotional. I liked one scene with the dancing part in this movie and for me, it was just gold. I loved it and I was entertained. It brought positive vibes. Of course not all of the movie was like this, there were many dramatic scenes that were just shocking and literally criminal. Moreover, I'm very impressed that the director of the movie himself was an actor in this movie. He did a great job!\n\nThe film's music selection complements its old-school vibe perfectly. Lastly, the ending is witty, thought-provoking, and complex, marking Pulp Fiction' as a distinctly original film in the landscape of cinema.\n\nIn short, \"Pulp Fiction\" is notable for its deliberate speed, in-depth character growth, and story centered around conversations. Quentin Tarantino's great camera work and the film's different places make it more interesting. The script cleverly combines humor and drama. The performances are fantastic, especially the memorable dance scenes and Tarantino's acting. The old school music makes the movie feel better. \"Pulp Fiction\" has per se a complex and thought-provoking story that makes a standout film. It showcases Tarantino's unique vision and storytelling skills."

The beauty of Pulp Fiction is how the story lines are so well intersected, and yet it begins and ends nearly exactly the same way. Not only is it one of the most important films of the 1990s, but it served as a platform for incredible dialogue, a veritable showcase depicting the bleak yet flashy glamour of 90s' LA, and a scenario of sorts of just what ordinary, and not-so-ordinary people can do when under duress."

I enjoyed the circular and completeness of the plot but it's strange when considered in light of the characters and the themes. I think far too many people take this movie at face value, and that value is a little disappointing. I enjoyed all the actor's performances and undeniably this movie has set a genre and a wealth of movie clich\u00e9s. But it's overlong and cringe-worthy at points. I just don't think it's a classic."

        "review_detailed_main": "Pulp - 1. A soft, moist, shapeless mass of matter . 2. A magazine or book containing lurid subject matter and being characteristically printed on rough, unfinished paper.\n\nQuentin Tarantino is a brilliant director and does an amazing job on his 2nd feature length film which is a terrific film. Samuel L. Jackson's performance as Jules is truly a role for the ages. John Travolta as Vince was also quite good but what I felt was that Bruce Willis as Butch and Ving Rhames as Marsellus really stole the show. The side story with Butch and Marsellus was filled to the brim with suspense. It leaves people anticipating what would happen next. Some people find the violence in the movie too much but personally I feel it has the perfect balance between gore and drama.\n\nMany Quentin Tarantino films tend to follow a non-linear pattern and Pulp Fiction perfects this formula to the max. The cameo made by Quentin as Jimmie is quite humorous in certain ways and feels like a proper fleshed-out character. Uma Thurman does a wonderful job portraying Mia . An underrated aspect of the film is how each character is related one way or the other. Jules and Vince were hired by Marsellus, Mia is married to Marsellus and Butch worked with him before. Overall i felt the movie was a masterpiece."

Then how viewers are taken through a journey of 3 stories that all intertwine together. Nothing is predictable through the movie like most movies are. Quentin Tarantino is an directs this movie amazingly. This movie is a all-time classic that you could watch 100 times and never get bored of it. The first time I watched it I watched it about 10 more times right after that because it was so good."

Quentin brilliantly writes plot devices and dialogue that carry the film and ultimately makes it enjoyable.\n\nAlthough it may seem that since the film goes knowhere, why should we care or watch besides pure entertainment, but I think there are underlying lessons themes here that are universally true.\n\nI learned the following after watching this movie: Foot massage ethics and when throwing someone off a building is justified What to do when someone over doses on heroine Don't mess with a guy looking for his dads watch Always save your boss who hates you from being raped How to clean up brain matter from your car so the cops don't notice How to stop some crazy couple from robbing a restaurant\n\nThere are so many enjoyable scenes that Tarantino crafts with such ingenious dialogue, like the \"Royale with cheese.\" \"Foot massage\" conversation and other dialogue make it seem like we are following normal people when really were following two hitmen.\n\nThe thing about these conversations is that they don't even lead anywhere, but despite that they add depth to the story and the characters.\n\n8.710."

Jackson and Uma Thurman although I'm not a fan of Uma Thurman. No offense to her, she just doesn't draw me in like other actresses do.\n\nSo it's about these two hit men who have to retrieve a stolen suitcase from some low level criminals. Those criminal's boss is a big level criminal who organizes for Bruce Willis's character Butch Coolidge to throw his next fight. That big level criminal gets one of his lackeys Vincent Vega played by John Travolta to take his wife Mia out dancing and the iconic \"fingers across the eyes in a peace sign\" dance was born.\n\nThere are many other characters whose lives are interwoven into these characters and to me, that was the fun part, to see how that played out. It's has some famous people (at the time) in smaller roles.\n\nThere's no real point to this story and it doesn't really have a beginning, or end. It just sort of starts and stops which is off putting to me and why I only gave it 6 stars. What kept me from going lower was the writing and the sort of outlandish characters and scenes that played out, almost at random throughout.\n\nWhile I liked this movie at the time, I don't think I would love it today if it were the first time I saw it. I would still watch it though for the nostalgia of it, but may not recommend it to anyone under 40."

        "review_detailed_main": "The modern-day movie public seems entranced with the in-your-face barbaric and crude film style of Quentin Tarantino. The writer-producer-actor definitely has talent, and an imagination. But films such as this that have long-running dialogs - some sensible but mostly far-fetched, need to have a solid plot to be interesting. The plot of \"Pulp Fiction\" is very weak - almost pointless. And when the long stretches of cinematic street philosophy are punctuated with brutal scenes of blood and guts, I don't find much of anything entertaining.\n\nI enjoy great mysteries, including some of the better film noir. But for the gore and guts movies to be good and have appeal, they must at least have an interesting plot and very good screenplay. \"Reservoir Dogs\" was such a Tarantino movie. But this plot has scenarios that bounce around in a weak screenplay. While there's a thin thread that connects some parts, others don't mesh. So, it comes across as a few short stories put together, some of which have the same characters.\n\nAn example of this is when Christopher Walken's Captain Koons tells a tall story to a young boy named Butch Coolidge. Two scenarios or so later, Butch is a full-grown boxer played by Bruce Willis. Other scenarios happen out of order, or in reverse order. This seems to be a style with Tarantino, and one that some movie critics and buffs think is a great talent. I think it's a technique meant to grab an audience where the writer can't figure out a way to do it with a straight story chronologically.\n\nThis sort of sets on end the long-standing teaching and methods of storytelling, writing, and playwrighting. And, there are a number of people who still prefer the chronological order of stories. We don't mind the use of flashbacks which are clearly identified as such. But wide changes in time or order, back and forth, from one scenario to another is confusing and says the author couldn't come up with the right ending. So, he or she used some weird techniques to make an ending superfluous. And, some of these films really don't have endings.\n\nThis film could have started or ended just about anyplace within the screenplay. Tarantino or the director just needed to shuffle the pages. It ruins what might be a good story for me. As for the acting in this film - what's so outstanding about characters spewing vulgarities back and forth, or screaming and intimidating people with foul threats in running expletives? Seems we all have a tantrum streak within us.\n\n\"Pulp Fiction\" isn't an enjoyable or entertaining film. It is a look at the underworld of drugs, thugs, blood and guts. The only thing I can see that might attract such near adulation for this film is the huge and diverse cast. But I'll take any number of other types of films that can entertain with solid plots, screenplays with civility, and great acting."

And believe me, you WILL see it several times! The cast is spot on, and the soundtrack is, wow! It is, as always with Tarantino, a bit odd, dark and complicated, but with just a tad of humor making it really cool and heavy, and adding that extra dimension to the movie! Overall it's a one of a kind movie, and already a classic, one of those you just have to have seen!"

        "review_title": "Not a film I feel passionately about, but still an undeniably fantastic second feature from Tarantino.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Quentin Tarantino had an immediate fan base following his career after the release of the excellent \"Reservoir Dogs\" in 1992, which only grew significantly upon the release of the much-revered \"Pulp Fiction\" two years later. Commonly referred to by many as one of the best films of the '90s, the film was simply a revolution, its impact undeniable. Many - perhaps the majority excepting those who prefer \"Jackie Brown\" - consider \"Fiction\" Tarantino's finest work. Countless film fans worship at its alter. Am I one of them? Not really. I think the film is fantastic for reasons I'll soon explain, but I don't passionately subscribe to it as Tarantino's best either. In fact, \"Django Unchained\" is easily better, and this film has serious claims to that title from \"Inglourious Basterds\" or \"Kill Bill: Vol. 2\" (YES, I think it's better than number one, okay...easily better, in fact).\n\nBut why is this film so particularly popular? It's remarkably clever, pop-culture-hip, reference-heavy dialogue is one such reason. There's no wonder it won Tarantino and Roger Avary an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. The technique on display only matches the words - Tarantino's patient, passionate direction and Andrzej Seku\u0142a's stylish yet unobtrusive are a match made in heaven.\n\nThe film is consistently tense, electrifying and unpredictable, and that is aided by its (at the time at least) unique non-linear narrative. It never complies with Hollywood movie clich\u00e9s, and even in 2016 this approach is refreshing.\n\nFans and viewers which of \"Fiction\"'s distinctive four chapters is its best. Some, like me, will place the first chapter (somewhat smug and self-satisfied, like Uma Thurman's performance on re-watches) and the last (overly convenient - how come nobody walks into a previously packed diner and interrupts the goings-on?) the worst of the best. They'll prefer the brutally tense mid-section involving the sexy anti-hero Butch Coolidge (perhaps a career-best Bruce Willis) and the darkly hilarious, clever Harvey Keitel-assisted murder clean-up. They are certainly the film's highlights for me. But the film encourages subjectivity (the suitcase, hello?) and perhaps these different interpretations are part of the fun of this wickedly clever, irrefutably influential modern classic."

Talking about direction, screenplay and cinematography. I found some things to be really unique. The way some things were done or shown. The acting was also great. And that's about it. The second half of the movie got a little tedious and I fell asleep. What I'm trying to say is it's a little too long which I think was unnecessary.

It showed in their acting and in their enthusiasm to get their characters just right."

        "review_detailed_main": "You must see this film simply because there's no other movie like it. It's Quentin Tarantino, red hot and constantly in motion, like the flames from the torches carried by the angry villagers in Frankenstein (1931). If you are new to Tarantino, and want to explore the style of this director/writer, Pulp Fiction is your starting gate.\n\nTarantino was clearly running on 12 cylinders with Pulp Fiction, from start to finish, and by the end of the film, you'll suddenly feel as if your heart had stopped beating and you had inexplicably forgotten how to breathe. And for all of its visual intensity and pathos, the film explodes with some of the most witty and cutting dialogue since John Houston's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948). You could spend all afternoon discussing Pulp Fiction's myriad of memorable quotes.\n\nThere are so many classic scenes in Pulp Fiction it would be a sacrilege to mention them here (although the \"hamburger scene\" stands out from everything else).\n\nThis is one of Quentin Tarantino's finest hours, and the film, bold and shocking, remains peerless."

        "review_detailed_main": "Now that it's almost 23 years later can we have a level-headed point of view on this movie? The hype machine in 1994 went into maximum overdrive with Pulp Fiction in a way that has rarely been repeated, even in a world over-saturated with easily accessible and multiple forms of media. For years people have regarded Pulp Fiction as if it is somehow far beyond any kind of criticism. It's time for scrutiny.\n\nAs a 150-minute series of vignettes within vignettes it makes for good entertainment the first few viewings, but I've seen Pulp Fiction from beginning to end about 10 times now and I can honestly say I am done with it.\n\nThe trashy nature of the stories and the wider world that the characters inhabit is a nice homage to the dime novels of the 1950s and other trash cinema of the era. And I mean trash. Pulp Fiction takes virtually no inspiration from anything with an ounce of class. Don't be fooled by the all-star cast and the larger- than-life characters.\n\nFor years people have been quoting the screenplay as if it were a breathtaking breakthrough in movie dialogue. It's not. If anything it is far too wordy. The editor should have been a little more liberal in cutting down the talking. There is an utterly pointless interaction between Travolta, Thurman, and Buscemi about a $5 shake that seems to go on forever. It adds absolutely nothing to scene at all and I cringe whenever I hear it. I can't believe I am even wasting my time bringing it up in this review, but it's a good example of frequent nothingness that should have been excised. Tarantino also seems to have an inability to reign in his actors here, leaving them to ham their way over the boundaries which gives many characters an unfocused, disconnected, and confusing riff. Travolta in particular seems off and alienating. He was probably just happy to get work at the time but there's no reason for why the rest of the cast didn't question the overwritten material.\n\nIt's also very dull to look at. Jack Rabbit Slims appears to be the only set specifically designed for the movie, which is why there is a colorful vibrancy to this scene that is found nowhere else. Almost every other shot takes place at street level in the most mundane parts of Los Angeles without any sense of location. The lazy Panavision photography just plonks the camera down at standard angles and indulges in far too much steadicam for its own good, all while never giving us much in the way of geography. It's very frustrating.\n\nPulp Fiction is competent with unique inspirations, but the movie has almost no original ideas and it has been massively over-regarded for far too long."

        "review_detailed_main": "Pulp Fiction may be one of the most profoundly misunderstood films of our time. One critic even called it a \"glorification of two whacked out hit-men\".Others called it 'flippant', \"nihilistic' and \"cynical'. Yet others took the bizarre line that no film should be made about such 'worthless' characters. Yet others called it 'plotless' and 'formless'. However, a careful viewing of Tarantino s film should reveal that , like most of the \"pulp fiction ' on which it is based, it is indeed profoundly moral. Even more, Tarantinos film earnestly grapples with SPIRITUAL issues. Tarantino has carefully studied the films of Dreyer and Bresson, as well as those of Don Spiegel and Phil Karlson.\n\nTo make my case for the spiritual -and moral core of this film, I will merely call attention to the ending of each of its three episodes. Each one ends with a human life or lives being saved. Yes , there is cynicism, flippancy and studied 'coolness' in Pulp Fiction. However, this is merely the glossy packaging in which Tarantino has concealed his profoundly-and rigorously- moral and spiritual message. This is a film about redemption."

Every scene is packed with witty dialogue, quirky characters, and unexpected twists that make you question reality while laughing out loud.\n\nIt's a wild, adrenaline-pumping ride with enough dark humor to make a stand-up comedian jealous. The non-linear storyline is a bold move that pays off in spades, keeping you on the edge of your seat, wondering what insane scenario will pop up next.\n\nTarantino's signature style-mixing violence with humor and pop culture references-turns what could have been a mess into a cult classic. If you haven't seen it yet, you're missing out on one of the most entertaining, quotable, and mind-bending films ever made.

Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been \"institutionalized\".\n\nThe directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.\n\nWhatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever.

        "review_title": "Tarantino's brilliant script both imitates and digs into pulp, uncovering meaning and richness",
        "review_detailed_main": "When Quentin Tarantino turned pulp fiction into cinematic art, everything changed. The auteur's second feature film marked the beginning of the rise of independent film in the '90s, but more importantly, it proved that the gratuitous sex, drugs, cursing and violence associated with \"low brow\" fiction could in fact be utilized intelligently for a higher artistic purpose. Essentially, \"Pulp Fiction\" proved that gratuitous genre films can be provocative and have something to say.\n\n\"Pulp Fiction\" is three connected short stories sandwiched between a fourth story cut in half and used as a prologue and epilogue. The brilliance of Tarantino's screenplay (with story help from Roger Avary) comes not merely from this structure, but the way these three distinct acts tie together in unexpected, poignant ways.\n\nAct I, \"Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife,\" is the film's most memorable. The stylization, the quotable dialogue and Uma Thurman's tantalizing presence as Mia Wallace stand out as the film's hallmarks, even though when weighed on the whole, this act has the least to do with the weightier, more meaningful components of the film.\n\nIt begins by introducing us to Vincent (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson), two black tie hit men working for Wallace (Ving Rhames) who are on their way to interrogate some young men who appear to have stolen a valuable briefcase of Wallace's. En route, they discuss such asinine things as the level of intimacy in a foot massage and what a McDonald's quarter-pounder is called in Paris, firmly routing the story in what appears to be meaningless drivel. The feel echoes Tarantino's \"Reservoir Dogs\" in a lot of ways. We then follow Vega in a classic \"take out the boss's wife but don't lay a finger on her\" story filled with romantic tension that goes majorly awry.\n\nAct II, \"The Gold Watch,\" introduces us to aging boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) as Wallace asks him to throw an upcoming match. We also learn about Butch's father's lucky gold watch, a family heirloom with a crazy history. There's a noir aspect to this part of the story, as Butch of course decides not to throw the fight and run away with his girl (Maria de Madeiros), but the reckoning we expect takes a series of unbelievable turns. As we make sense of the chaos, notions of good vs. bad luck and good vs. evil \u2014 or bad vs. ****ing evil \u2014 start to appear, even as it plays for pulp entertainment.\n\nAct III, \"The Bonnie Situation,\" takes Jules and Vincent down a peg as they too get \"lucky\" but then must deal with a mistake that requires the help of a fixer named Wolf (Harvey Keitel). The whole ordeal has Jules contemplating the notion of divine intervention, and we begin to see all the events in the film as being either about luck, coincidence, divine intervention, or any other number of ways you can look at twists of fortune.\n\nBy digging into the story and uncovering these deeper themes, Tarantino transforms everything else about the film from hollow pulp fiction to rich pulp fiction. He proves that meaning can come even from the perverted, salacious material. A notion of social responsibility even sneaks its way in by the end.\n\nAs a director, Tarantino impressively wields suspense in the form of anticipated violence. It has remained his calling card ever since. Nobody can craft a modern day Mexican standoff like he seems to effortlessly do in every film. He also delivers on that anticipation of violence in a satisfying way. He goes big, but he never goes so far as to completely rip us out of this story.\n\nThe greatest of great films always have unforgettable scenes that are somewhat inessential if not tangential to the story. Vincent and Mia twisting in the '50s-themed restaurant to Chuck Berry's \"You Never Can Tell;\" Christopher Walken's cameo relaying the story of the gold watch to a young Butch \u2014Tarantino's creative choices really pop out, which happens when you've crafted an excellent story.\n\nYet the literary quality that Tarantino brings to this curse-filled and violent film is it's crowning achievement. Even just the Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) and Pumpkin (Tim Roth) scenes that bookend the film have so much to say about fate and free will, and the things that happen to Vincent whenever he takes a bathroom break with a pulp magazine seem to offer a meta-commentary on the entertaining distraction typically associated with these kinds of genre films.\n\n\"Pulp Fiction\" really tore down walls for filmmakers exposed to and inspired by pulp and other \"lesser\" forms of entertainment who wanted to grow up and make art. It certainly gave Tarantino an audience to keep telling these kinds of stories. From spaghetti westerns to kung fu movies, he finds a depth and richness to them and channels that into his own storytelling. \"Pulp Fiction\" happens to be his finest example as well as one of his first.\n\n~Steven C\n\nThanks for reading!

        "review_detailed_main": "Tarantino wrote a screenplay with Roger Avary for one of the greatest films of all time. Amazing shots but an even greater cast brought together by Ronnie Yeskel and Gary M. Zuckerbrod. Each performer brought emotion, hilarity, and a sense of realism to the scenes. One specifically, Uma Thurman's scene as Mia going through an OD, the seriousness within the scene on each character's face and the stillness of Thurman's person and aftershock was scary real. Viewing this from two different age groups (my younger brother saw it with me) we saw the characters had depth and the cast altogether was hand picked to perfection. It's no wonder the box office first weekend alone had brought more than triple the budget! Would greatly recommend to anyone!"

Despite my incredibly high expectations and annoyance as a result of the huge subtitles on my screen, I think it's safe to say that this is one of my favorite movies of all time. It feels so natural, every pretentious person saying the dialogue in this movie is extraordinary and that's what makes it great, is, as it turns out, right! I have never seen such a chaotic mess of a movie, so beautifully and harmonically made. Truly a great experience, even for me, who randomly decided to pick it up and watch it on my couch."

In this novel overall structure, every story in \"pulp fiction\" is told coherently. What's neat about pulp fiction's narrative structure is that it overturns the conventional notion of linear time and space without losing a large audience by being too experimental. In pulp fiction, violence often goes hand in hand with black humor, and black humor can be surprising and unimaginable, but what makes pulp fiction unique is that it depicts the Christian faith. The film was cut to pieces by the director to cover up the truth that people should have faith."

        "review_detailed_main": "At the beginning of the film, right before it starts, there is a definition of the two words that make up the title of this film. One word that should have been defined is the word classic. If you ask me what my definition of a classic film is, it is one that is easily remembered, whether that be by memorable quotes, characters or scenery and thoroughly enjoyable to the point where you will want to see it on a regular basis. I could go on and on about all of that but I will say this is one film that has changed the way I see films. It has become one of my all time favourites as a result. As soon as I started watching it the first time, I knew this was something special. I cannot even tell you how many times I have watched it but I always remember the witty dialogue, the violence, characters, etc. Even thought it is officially defined as a crime/drama film, I can't help but find a few of the scenes as side splitting hilarious. I see perfection as a bit of a myth but to me, Pulp Fiction is as close as it comes to a perfect film. The casting of the roles is very good, in particular, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman, script writing is fantastic, not just because of the witty dialogue but due to Quentin Tarantino being brave by telling this story in a non-traditional, non-linear fashion. Kudos also to Tarantino's direction, showing why he is one of the best modern Hollywood directors out there. Speaking of kudos, I think Pulp Fiction's legacy has grown since being released in 1994 and should have won at least two more Academy Awards, namely Samuel L. Jackson as Best Supporting Actor and Quentin Tarantino as Best Director. Nevertheless, it has truly stood the test of time and is one of the best of the 1990's and of all time as well."

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie was directed by Quentin Tarantino and is considered to be a turn in the history of Hollywood cinema. It was released on 14th October 1995 and maintains its position #5 in IMDb's top 250 list ever since. The great thing about this movie is the its non-linear storyline which keeps the audience interested. It revolves around the lives of two mob hit men, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and a pair of diner bandits intertwine in four tales of violence and redemption.. The thing that most amused me is long duration continuous shots and the brilliant acting done by Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta and Uma Thurman. This movie has some great all time favorite dialog like \"I dare you, I double dare you\" and many more. The music in the movie is great as it very well keeps the pace and rhythm of the movie and keeps viewers interested.\n\nComing to the composition of the movie, the sudden movement of space and time is very well composed and directed. The movie starts from present, goes into the past, then jumps to future and comes back to the present. This is very well crafted so that the audience do not get confused.\n\nComing to awards and nominations, it won an Oscar for the best writing and screenplay and got numerous nominations for best picture, best actor, best actor in the supporting role, best director and many more. Overall it won 62 awards and 46 nominations and an Oscar which is a sign of great movie.\n\nSo I would like to conclude by saying that it is indeed a great movie to watch with good plot,acting and direction and one should watch it at least once."

However the distinct lack of a coherent plot, the disjointedly interwoven and half-baked story lines, the absence of characterization and incorrectly using of the music, makes this movie a good example of bad Cinema!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Pulp Fiction is an American movie released in 1994 and one of the most impressive films of the 90\u00b4s. It\u00b4s Quentin Tarantino\u00b4s masterpiece and is categorized as police/suspense. It lasts 1h54 and has the age rating of 18. It was produced by Lawrence Bender and Tarantino himself and the story was written by Tarantino and Roger Avary. Pulp Fiction had a budget of 8 million dollars. Pulp Fiction was the movie that released Tarantino to the stardom: Tarantino being the director, screenwriter, producer and actor all together. He was born on March 27, 1963, USA and he achieved fame in the early 90's for his nonlinear scripts. He loves to use graphic violence, rich dialogues - with a mix of irony and humor - and violence. Pulp Fiction\u00b4s main characteristic is the nonlinear narrative, feature followed by the Brazilian film director Fernando Meirelles in Cidade de Deus. It is a vanguard movie, using and abusing of camera techniques and encompassing movie tricks. It\u00b4s a masterpiece that collects high class actors like John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackon, Bruce Willis and, Tarantino\u00b4s darling, Uma Thurman. The four independent stories, but brilliantly connected by a unique theme of violence, are all magnificent, bringing up the discussion of violence and moral values. It made Tarantino win the Oscar of best original script besides the Golden Palm in Cannes. The soundtrack - lights on You Never Can Tell by guitar legend Chuck Berry - amplifies the film's immersion into an amazing and nostalgic atmosphere. Pulp Fiction, despite its extreme violence, is a delight to our eyes and ears. So, I dare you! I double dare you to watch the movie!"

I can't give this a perfect score, however, because the more I watch this movie, the longer and longer the Thurman-Travolta story seems to take. The portions of the movie with Samuel L., John Travolta and Bruce Willis are by far the most interesting portions of the story - there is better dialogue and what lies behind the curtain is more substantial. The hour or so with Uma Thurman is simply not very interesting. It bogs the story down, bringing the movie almost to a halt. I like the way Tarrantino directs the film and the screen play is excellent, though there is so much swearing that it is almost difficult to overcome. I don't know anyone that swears nearly as much as these characters do (typical of anything QT has written) - newsflash Quentin, outswearing a Marine doesn't add to a story.\n\nMuch better than average, but not exceptional. *** of ****"

I intended to watch Pulp Fiction & Reservoir Dogs after I seen Kill Bill Vol 1 & 2 which I really liked because of the same director Quentin Tarantino. He became my favourite director after I seen Kill Bill Vol 1 & 2 but no longer when I seen Pulp Fiction. It has all the possible bad things in a film and the list is endless. There is nothing but drug use and swearing that made my ears bleed, the F word was repeated more times than the number of heartbeats of a person's lifetime. None of the stories were appealing...in fact I just don't know what's going on because there was no structure or plot. The film was about 2.5 hours and I hated every second, it was Extremely boring that I had a sore head & I felt like ripping my arm out and constantly bash my head with it. Anyway I can go on forever.\n\nI just don't know why it's #5 on the IMDb top 250? Maybe because mostly people have accidentally clicked on 10 instead of 1 out of 10. Quentin Tarantino must have pulled the script from his bum and was running about in a circle with it then his wife must of hit him on the head with a rolling pin and said, \"You promised me no more rubbish films!\" He must of found a brain in a fruit bowl before he made Kill Bill he also looks like a idiot and talks like a girl. Now I don't intend to watch Reservoir Dogs. Crap Fiction is now definitely on my top 5 worst films of all time and is in second place. First is either Jackass the movie 1 or 2.\n\nIt is critically acclaimed because 97% of critics have no brains and the rest of the 3% have cheated in their exams. That is why they always give good reviews to bad films and bad reviews to good films. Overall no matter what ever happens there will never be a worse film than Crap Fiction. Any movie in the IMDb bottom 100 is better and I would like to salute anyone who has given it a 1 out of 10. This whole comment is only 1% expression of hate to this stupid, crap, junk, garbage & good for nothing film."

I'm sure it was one of the movies that its beginning was the end of it.Or in better language,it was one of the first postmodern movies.Take it easy. How can your luck be bad?This movie has lots of bad chances.Your boss's wife overdoses and is dying on you and this thing must be unknown.What will you do?You get out of the toilet and see your enemy is standing right at opposite of you and wants to kill you with your own gun.Or you're talking to your friend and he's sitting at the car's behind seat.You look at him during the talk and your pistol's in your hand,suddenly your gun takes the shot by itself.You haven't shot the legs,hands,or even the chest;You've shot straight at your friend's head!And when you wake up,you've taken s--t in the car and it's full of blood and skull pieces.What will you do to hide from the cops?There are many things like this.Well it's great.Enjoy the acts and screenplay.Some dialogs are so funny some are about bad things.Pulp Fiction is a real pulp fiction.PULP FICTION IS THE LORD."

In 1994 it broke over my head like a thunderclap, and in 1990s Britain this touchstone of cool seemed to extend its dangerous influence everywhere: movies, fiction, journalism, media, fashion, restaurants, you name it. Everyone was trying to do irony and incorrectness, but without his brilliance it just looked smug. (The Americans get Tarantino; we get Guy Ritchie and Jeremy Clarkson.)"

The level of hype surrounding this and the other (place epithet here) made by this twerp is disgusting. What drugs are being passed around in Hollywood board rooms? I'd really like to know what kind of hallucinogenic it was. I saw this (place epithet here) and I was disturbed in the way it manipulates the stupider members of the audience. Getting high on violence is a good thing? Tarantino is a cancerous festering oozing lesion on the anus of the film world. Good film making technique aside, are we really prepared for the level of nihilism this kind of (place epithet here) represents? This is just (place epithet here) elevated to Olympian \"ART FILM\" status. The presence of some reasonably good actors just proves that actors generally have very poor judgement and like the misquote of Hitchcock \"are cattle\". This, and the previously mentioned disease's other films are the absolute ultimate in pandering to the lowest common denominator of the hormonally challenged adolescent male mindset that Hollywood seems to be pervertedly in love with (film school critic retards included). This is only my opinion, but I know other cinema literate people who share it. The fact that this was nominated for Oscars is too abhorrent to bear. Add style and you can serve overrated (place epithet here) to the most pretentious."

Director and co-screenwriter Quentin Tarantino synthesized such seemingly disparate traditions as the syncopated language of David Mamet; the serious violence of American gangster movies. Prizefighter Butch Coolidge has decided to stop payment on a deal he's made with the devil. Honey Bunny and Pumpkin are young lovers and small time thieves who decide they need a change of venue. Meanwhile, two career criminals, Vincent Vega and Jules, go about their daily business of shooting up other crooks that are late on payments to their boss. While one is asked to baby sit their boss' dangerously pretty young wife, the other suddenly realizes that he must give up his life of crime."

        "review_detailed_main": "After the success that he had with 1992's \"Reservoir Dogs\", Tarantino came back strong with his second written and directed full-length feature film, \"Pulp Fiction\". Some would argue that this neo-noir black crime film is his masterpiece. Like his previous film, this offers just as much violence and brutality, which again is wrapped up with lots of style and substance.\n\nThis film has seven narrative sequences, with three primary storylines, which are all interwoven, making it a hard watch for some people, while others marvel at its construct. Mob hitman Vincent Vega (John Travolta) is the protagonist of storyline 1, Butch Coolidge the boxer (Bruce Willis) is the protagonist of storyline 2, and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) is the 3rd storyline protagonist. The film goes from a prologue (diner hold-up), to Vincent, Jules, and then Butch, before going full circle the epilogue and the diner hold-up again.\n\nI enjoyed this in the 1990's when I first watched it, and I've never shied away from watching it again given the opportunity. It might not be everybody's cup of tea and it certainly is not for the younger audiences (even of post 2020!), but I enjoy it and can appreciate its technicality. Having the benefit of 20+ years of hindsight it is interesting to see lots of films that have come out since and tried to replicate part of this film, most have failed too. It is a testament to how good this film is though that it can inspire other people to try, not just in film but other mediums too - games, comics, etc. If you have not seen this film it is absolutely worth a watch, and if you have seen it, why not watch it again and find something you missed last time - or discuss some of the themes, homages, or McGuffin's to try and work out your own messages (the gold light in the suitcase for example - I would love to believe it is Marcellus's soul. It ties in with the plaster on the back of his head, and with the combination of '666' on the briefcase - but this has been widely debunked). A cracking film and an enjoyable piece of art - one of Tarantino's finest films in my opinion."

Just as Taxi Driver & Raging Bull made people watch Mean Streets Unlike Tarantino, personally I'm not blindly devoted to Scorsese and won't say Taxi Driver and Mean Streats we're over my head..I believe they helped get to Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Casino, The Departed, and Wolf. Sequencing and Narrative films(Narrative was mainstreamed by Scorsese with Ray Liota, Pecci & DeNiro in Casino & DeCaprio in Wolf). Tarantino uses Narrative in Both Kill Bill films and I'm the Hateful 8. The other influence adjusted for audiences with a shorter attention Span was Leone..in terms of using Ennio Marricone..(John Williams has nothing on him)..and the pre-violence filming e.g. Uma's 1:1 Face Offs, the emergence of the Bear Jew to bash in the Nazi sergeants brains in etc.. I write this because I am surprised that the Biggest Goof is not mentioned anywhere and I'm surprised it took me so long to see it because it's so Glaring perhaps. When the story line goes back to \"Bonnie's House and Vincent tell Jules to chill him out, one can clearly see the \"miracle bullet holes\" in the Wall behind Jules before the other kid comes in 5 feet away with the arm cannon and \"Shoots off 5 rounds that missed\" leading to their \"Metaphysical Discussion about Divine Intervention\""

Pulp fiction is set in the world of humour, violence and inflated realism. It's is reaking of popular culture references at most times in the context of the sub-culture and underground. Being highly stylized, direction both visual and emotional, makes this film truly memorable and unique. No wonder it was nominated for seven Oscars and was also awarded at 1994 Cannes.. Pulp fiction is composed of all the classic best. Great and lively performances by Uma Thurman, John Travolta, Samuel L.

This time, a budget and a cast come along for the ride, a ride that's chopped up into four stories circling a handful of people. There's a mob boss, the mob boss's wife, a boxer, a pair of raucous gangsters and a couple who resemble the contemporary Bonnie and Clyde. Now, you need to look at Pulp Fiction as an adaptation of a comic, and less as a linear story. There's no broad plot, only a smattering of small stories linking the oddballs on display. Surprisingly its style works wonders. Its cool, edgy, bombastic and just as outrageous (if not more) as Tarantino's first film, Reservoir Dogs. Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta and Uma Thurman make the biggest impact with personalities hard to beat. The dialogue is heavy, but witty and clever, the soundtrack glorious and the movie is wrought with memorable scenes. Mentionable moments include Thurman and Travolta's dancing, Jackson's reciting of a passage from the bible, and Travolta's accident. Tarantino proves that his first attempt at filmmaking wasn't a lucky one."

All the best of the best. Amazing work!\n\nPulpFiction, I must admit, is a stellar piece of cinema. A literally star-studded cast portrays the characters beautifully, making you feel their joy and pain. Plot wise, there are numerous twists and turns, as to be expected, but they all manage to fit together rather nicely. And while some things do remain unexplained or unaccounted for in the end, it doesn't leave the viewer wanting. Dialogue in this movie is particularly delightful, with much reverence to dark humor and double-talk (not unlike the film Lucky Number Slevin). Ultimately the scenes I really like were with Uma Thurman. I think Tarantino delivered a solid piece worthy of the place it's earned in the upper echelons of most critics' \"top 10\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "I agree totally with the people here who have said, among other things, that Pulp Fiction is gratuitously violent, morally corrupt, and designed to appeal to hormonally imbalanced young males. I first saw it when it came out in 1994 and as I watched, couldn't understand why the other people in the room (my friend and her parents) were not outraged like I was. One of the more horrifying scenes that will always stand out in my mind is where a young black man is murdered and then his body dumped into the boot (trunk) of a car like a discarded shop mannequin. All this, supposedly in the name of 'art'.\n\nPeople say life doesn't imitate art but I disagree. How many kids saw Harry Potter and then went home and pretended to be wizards? Of course people are influenced by art, and even if they are not influenced directly, the overall sentiment or message will often leech it's way under the skin. So what kind of message are we sending out about how we treat human beings with movies like this? Why is spraying bullets into someone's head and then making jokes about how their blood will be cleaned out of the car their body has been dumped in something we want to put on film?\n\nIt worries me that Tarentino knew he'd have a market for this kind of movie; Obviously, some of us want to see a movie like this ... disturbing, I believe.\n\nNo amount of sophisticated direction or stylization can be used to justify this kind of travesty. Quentin Tarentino, you ought to be truly ashamed of yourself.\n\nToo unworthy to even rate."

        "review_detailed_main": "Much like Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction works so well because of its structure. In Tarantino's freshman effort, he used the out of time elements to break up the one set monotony and provide lighter tonal moments here and there. In Pulp Fiction, it's used at the behest of thematic material, and I think it works on a whole different level.\n\nIt's sort of an anthology film, but the three sections a little too interconnected to just lay it like that. They're connected through a similar set of characters that appear in, or are talked about, in all three, but also with the common theme of choice in the face of fate.\n\nIn every story, from the dual framing devices (the caf\u00e9 and the shootout over the suitcase) to the three main stories, characters are presented with inflection points in their lives, and they chose to go one way or another. Vincent Vega has come back to Los Angeles from several years as \"the man in Amsterdam\". One of his first tasks is to take his mob boss's wife, Mia Wallace, out for dinner, to provide her with company while her husband, Marsellus Wallace, is out of town. There's an connection between them that caps with them both dancing in a twist contest in the wonderfully grotesque nostalgia restaurant Jack Rabbit Slim's. Vincent refuses to take the next step, though. We're not quite sure if Mia would go to bed with Vincent (the way she talks about her husband demonstrates her fidelity towards him), but her willingness isn't the point. The point is Vincent's desire to make a move. He feels it's within the realm of possibility, but he refuses to take that step.\n\nOf course, he never really gets the chance because Mia has found Vincent's stash of heroin and snorted it, which was simply too much for her system and she began to overdose. This leads to the most famous scene in the movie where Vincent has to puncture Mia's breastplate with a six inch needle in Vincent's drug dealer's house. It's a great moment of tension with a fantastic shock.\n\nTaking a step back from that description of the first major third of the film, I think we can see in microcosm why Pulp Fiction works so well. We have fantastically written characters. We have an exploration of the central theme playing out dramatically. We have some spectacle in the form of the needle episode. It's a marvelous combination of entertainment, character work, and strong thematic material wrapped together extraordinarily well.\n\nThe second third deals with Butch, a boxer we saw talking with Marsellus Wallace in the first. This also takes place after the third section. Butch has agreed to throw his fight, but he used the quasi-public knowledge of the agreement to cleanup on the odds and win big by winning the fight. He's prepped and ready to go, talking lightly with his girlfriend Fabienne as they spend the night in a hotel talking about the nature of attractiveness (really, her desire for a pot belly), and make fun of each other. He's set for life, and he knows it, but something's wrong. His father's watch is missing, left behind at the apartment. Christopher Walken actually started the story with a telling of the history of that watch (the famous ass watch scene), which he delivers wonderfully. It also sells the importance of the watch to Butch so that when he suddenly loses his cool and decides to brave what should surely be certain death to get it back, we get it. It makes sense. He has to go get it. There's no other choice. He goes back, gets it, gives Vincent a chest full of led from Vincent's own gun, and then accidentally happens across Marsellus Wallace as he drives away.\n\nThere's fate again, presenting Butch with a situation where he has a choice. After a car crash and a limp-filled foot chase, the two end up trapped in the basement of two perverts (one a cop) who proceed to rape Wallace. Butch uses his opportunity to escape and has another choice. He could leave, scot free, or he could free Wallace. He does the right thing, grabs a samurai sword, and cuts down the perverts (and their gimp with a solid punch to the face). Wallace returns this favor by letting Butch go. They will break ties and have no more to do with each other.\n\nThe third is where the thematic material comes out most and comes to the best conclusion. Even though it happens before the rest of the movie, the path that Jules follows and how he ends the film is the culmination of the ideas flowing through it. We pick back up with Vincent and Jules in the apartment with the briefcase. An unknown gunman jumps out and fires, emptying his gun in their direction but hitting nothing. After the darkly comic episode where they have to clean up brains from the back of their car, Vincent and Jules settle down in the caf\u00e9 that started the film as Jules talks about their miraculous escape and how he plans on facing that with the rest of his life. Vincent considers it a freak accident, but Jules sees it as a sign from a higher power. He's been given an opportunity and a choice, and he's going to take a new path in response to it. He demonstrates that new path by allowing the robbers from the beginning of the film to leave with their lives.\n\nThinking back over the rest of the movie, we realize the order of events as they played out chronologically and discover that Vincent died after the ending of the movie, at Butch's hands. If Jules had kept on his path without diverting it, ascribing the freak gun event as mere happenstance instead of a sign, Jules might have died there too. The universe reached out to both Vincent and Jules, and it was only Jules who read the sign correctly to run off to be like Caine from Kung Fu.\n\nSo, sitting back, what is Pulp Fiction? First, it's a story that's told out of order chronologically but is arranged in a way that heightens its emotional and thematic impact. It's very well acted, filled with wonderful conversations between well-drawn and interesting characters. It's dotted with great moments of excitement, the kind you expect from a good time at the movies. It's an entire package of entertainment, thematic weight, and great characters.\n\nNo wonder it made such a splash."

Fast and witty dialogue, stylish direction, strong performances, flawless editing, fun and popular songs, and a unique approach to telling the story. Quentin is one of the few writer/directors that has the ability to have a movie be highly accessible as well as being filled with true style and entertaining substance. It's art that everyone loves. I've never met a person who didn't like pulp fiction and it's rare to meet someone who hasn't seen it. All these actors are giving career best performances from Samuel L Jackson to Harvey keitel, hell, even John travolta got an Oscar nomination for his role as the lead, Vincent Vega. The writing has a good ebb and flow between comedy and drama, sometimes a combination of the two. I can't say anything about this film that hasn't already been said. I'm just writing this review so I can strengthen my writing and this is my first review so cut me some slack. Don't be a square and get ready for an adrenaline fueled masterpiece of a movie."

It felt like those experimental, amateur films, which I personally didn't like at all...\n\nThen there were the conversations within the film: as always with Tarantino's films, obscenely profane and crude, plus they get nowhere...\n\nMoreover, I found it over the top violent. Obviously, the storyline wouldn't be the same without all the violence, but at times I found it to be overdone on that department...\n\nLastly, I found the script to be utterly appalling, in true Tarantino fashion, and nonsensical at parts...\n\nI only liked one thing about Pulp Fiction: the acting. Everyone did their best and in the end, wasn't the actors that disappointed me, but the film's script...\n\nSo, the verdict:\n\nIt might be that I dislike everything that involves Quentin Tarantino, (his signature obscene violence and cruelly long, pointless and crude conversations have always appalled me) but I cannot give this film more than a 3 out of 10. For me it was painful to watch, only to reach a disappointing ending. Utter loss of time! But then again, it seems I'm one of few here on IMDb that disliked Pulp Fiction..."

I'm also not a fan of Tarantino's out-of-chronology approach, which messes things up a bit (like a character dying in one scene, then appearing in the next). The acting was strong besides an awful performance by Tarantino himself in a guest appearance, the script just didn't hit me. It had some great moments though. The \"big three\" of the movie (those names above) were really good, Willis in particular, who showed that he can really act when he isn't just blowing things up.

No, Pulp Fiction is a movie that doesn't rely on special effects or hype to sell as does many movies such as Lord of The Rings. This movie is real. The monolog delivered by John Travolta in Swordfish applies to this movie: no moronic sentences, no bad acting, and a story seemingly flawless. Yes this movie deserves to be compared to The Godfather Part I, and buy the DVD."

This film is a lot of fun, masterfully written and executed to absolute perfection by Quentin Tarantino. This, in my humble opinion, is a much better effort than his previous Reservoir Dogs. This film is a perfect example of a good non-linear narration done right. It's not too difficult to mess up a movie whose storyline isn't told in chronological order, but Tarantino knows how to pull it off, how to make it entertaining and endlessly appealing from start to finish. There was never a dull moment in this movie. To sum up Pulp Fiction, it would be fair to say that it is 154 minutes of pure cinematic magic."

Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Harvey Keitel, Eric Stoltz, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Maria de Medeiros, Christopher Walken, Rosanna Arquette, Peter Greene, Duane Whitaker, Angela Jones, Phil LaMarr, Steve Buscemi, Bronagh Gallagher, Laura Lovelace, and Quentin Tarantino Directed By: Quentin Tarantino Review JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE A CHARACTER DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE CHARACTER. When I went to a Film Production class I eventually dropped out of, the professor and a classmate where like how can you want to be a film critic and have not seen Pulp Fiction and would always ask me you seen Pulp Fiction yet everyday. Pulp Fiction is set in the early ninety's and tells three stories of characters played by John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman and Bruce Willis to name a few. As the film started I didn't get it but as we went through the first two stories I started to get the gist of it. If it weren't the first few weeks I was in that class I wouldn't have noticed the shots in the second story where John Travolta and Uma Thurman sitting down in the diner how the shots are equivalent to each other and don't change too often. The films a product of the nineties with its music but my favorite scenes is those silent moments like in the diner or in the last story where a man in the bathroom comes out starts shooting at Vincent(John Travolta) and Jules(Samuel L. Jackson) and it stops they look and you know whats bout to happen. I love how all the stories leave on a note like whatever happen to these two or whats going to go on next, it doesn't just give you an answer. Pulp Fiction is one of the great giant achievements in filmaking and in film history and I can see why. The stories are fun to sit through and all the shots from director and star Quentin Tarantino are amazing and the cast is very memorable."

Wake up early morning, eat, school, jack off etc. etc. etc. I would come back home from school, shower, eat then try and find ways to waste time. I would flip through channels like a magazine, or probably treat myself to a snack. The thing that made this day special, was that I was going to watch (IMO) the greatest movie of all time. Before watching this movie, my taste was.... Generic, to say the least. My favorite movie was The A-Team. My taste was horrible. I recently watched Inception, so I was slowly being... Devoured or welcomed (whichever way you see it) into the movie world. After watching THIS piece of art, however, I was just amazed. The acting was amazing. The directing was pitch perfect. And the script... Oh jumping Jesus on a pogo stick, the script left me speechless. I envy those movie watchers who get to watch this for the first time. Anyways, fast forward a couple of months later, i already watched; Casablanca, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Raging Bull, The Godfather, Reservoir Dogs, Schindler's List, TGTBTU, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, L.A Confidential, Apocalypse Now, Fight Club and so on and so forth. I would recommend this or The Godfather for any person that wants to 'get IN' movies. Since both are classics and impossible to dislike.\n\n11/10"

We even had a hit-man go clean and profess that he will be a holy monk and wander the earth in peace! The filming techniques are camera use are incredible, and the casting made careers for younger actors (and revived a few, for older ones!). it is my understanding that Tarrantino's editor for Pulp, is the same woman he has used in every film since!"

It is bizarre contrast between murder and funny discussions.\n\nThe acting. Well I think John Travolta was bad, even tho he got critical acclaim. But Samuel give the performance of his life.\n\nThe drugs. I like that this movie didn't focus on sex. It feels so cheap. Instead, it depicts a housewife's cocaine use. Classy scenes of injecting top grade heroin. It is all very stylish and really makes the movie sexy, it didn't feel like a cheap trick.\n\nIt is morbid humor, appealing to all of us mainstream moviegoers, as well as for respected critics."

I was bored out of my mind from the first scene to the last waiting patiently for a twist of some sort to tie the multiple stories together, which never happened. Probably my least favorite movie i've ever watched. The acting wasn't bad and the film did tie in some aspects of popular culture and previous films, but if the viewer doesn't give a crap about any of the characters whatsoever, or the plot(if you could call it that), then whats the point. I gained nothing from watching this movie besides an intense feeling of emptiness that usually comes after wasting 150 or so minutes of your life watching a pathetic piece of crap film about nothing. Was I at the edge of my seat, yes, however It wasn't because of the suspense, I couldn't keep my head from falling forward or my eyes open. And the way that the scenes were arranged, terrible. The movie memento is hard to follow sometimes and slightly dull at some points but at least there was a freaking point in the way the scenes were arranged, considering the main character had memory problems. In this movie, there was no reason for the random mix up of the scenes, except to just do something different and make a movie so weird and disgusting the critics think its a masterpiece. I usually like movies that are critically acclaimed, like The Godfather, one of my favorite movies, but Pulp Fiction isn't even in the ball park. There isn't the dark complex characters like in the godfather, just a bunch of rambling idiots tripping over their stupidity."

Kurosawa's \"Seven Samurai\" is one, \"The Godfather\" is another and of course there is \"Pulp Fiction\". What can you say about a film that 14 years later is often imitated but never quite duplicated? From inventive camera angles, non-linear story-telling, and snazzy dialogue, all of which are perfect examples of the film's attributes that are often attempted to be replicated but with little or no success. Today its cast members are all known stars in their own right but at the time were relative unknowns or were in a considerable rut in their careers. It was this film that made it where they pretty much can name their own ticket, and have.\n\nWhen people ask me, \"What is is about 'Pulp Fiction' that you like?\" I have to answer, \"It is better to to tell you what I don't like about it because the answer is shorter, and that answer is 'nothing' \". Why? Because the film is absolutely flawless. Intriguing, unassuming, characters that makes the experience all the more authentic. This coupled with a perfect script and polished acting make this perhaps the most entertaining crime drama of the 90's or of all time. It is just one of the jewels that make up the cinematic releases of, in my opinion, one of the greatest decades for movies up to date. Granted, \"Pulp Fiction\" is not for everyone but if you have a strong stomach and have a scrupulous officiousness towards the criminal underworld then this film is a must see."

What really pulled me in right from the start is what we've now come to know as a Tarantino trademark: the dialogue. When gangsters Jules and Vincent talk to each other (or all the other characters, for that matter) there is a natural flow, a sense of realism and yet something slightly over the top and very theatrical about their lines - it's a mixture that immediately grabs your attention (even if it's just two dudes talking about what kind of hamburger they prefer, or contemplating the value of a foot-massage). Then there's the music: the songs Tarantino chose for his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of music are now immediately associated with 'Pulp Fiction'. And the narrative: the different story lines that come together, the elegantly used flashbacks, the use of \"chapters\" - there is so much playful creativity at play here, it's just a pure joy to watch.\n\nIf you're a bit of a film geek, you realize how much knowledge about film and love for the work of other greats - and inspiration from them - went into this (Leone, DePalma, Scorsese and, of course, dozens of hyper-stylized Asian gangster flicks), but to those accusing Tarantino of copying or even \"stealing\" from other film-makers I can only say: There has never been an artist who adored his kind of art that was NOT inspired or influenced by his favorite artists. And if you watch Tarantino's masterpiece today, it's impossible not to recognize just what a breath of fresh air it was (still is, actually). Somehow, movies - especially gangster films - never looked quite the same after 'Pulp Fiction'. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most sizzling, iconic dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such a crazy, cool, inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it for the first time. It's - well: it's 'Pulp Fiction'. 10 stars out of 10."

Jackson lost the Oscar for this, though the winner was worthy as well, but this is his finest screen appearance in a long career. I've never been a fan of John Travolta and I'm still not, but he won me over here in the performance of his life. One cannot get into all of the cast as it is stocked with many major talents who all shine. It's original to say the least, it's smart, it's funny, it's tense, you name it.

This obviously means that the film was not entirely as the director intended it to be. I must say 'though that, while this film has many interesting features, some classy acting and the occasional witty repartee', it is in my opinion on the whole nothing more than a crude and juvenile attempt to shock and offend the majority of the movie watching population. Being visually and verbally assaulted by film may well make for a memorable cinematic experience but doesn't necessarily make for a good film. But it isn't so much the action itself as much as the language which achieves this - and most of the profanities (and I include the all too frequent use of n****r in this list) were unnecessary - I tend to side with Spike Lee on this issue, QT is never gonna be a black man no matter how hard he might try. And while this movie is offensive and far from original, it has some very clever aspects and shows some of the directorial class QT clearly has (although no real acting ability - his cameo was a big mistake). In all I ended up with rather mixed feelings about this movie. My vote 7/10"

And rented it against my better judgement : since the previews had done little to entice me.\n\nAs objective as an analysis goes : (here's my 0.02$)\n\nPositives : 1) The movie is original 2) the way the multiple stories intersect is probably the high-point 3) It contains seasoned actors that perform the role as well as can be expected. 4) I did smile during the door shooting scene with Travolta & Jackson, and few others humours one-liners/conversations.\n\nNegatives : I) There is *way* too much foul language ... is it possible to let the clock tick with hearing an f-word, I can even commend times it should be used to underline/emphasize ...etc ... but every 45 seconds !!!\n\nII) Individually, some stories might have become interesting - but by just skimming on the better ones (Bruce Willis) - and digging deeper in the blander ones (Travolta's)and the dude \"bagged\" in the car = you come away with a : Yeah - so what ? lingering in your mind.\n\nIII) A few original lines and skewed timeline doesn't a movie make. One has the sense of a hyped up boxing match where the Champ get cut in the 1st minute of the 1st round, thus ruled a \"no-contest\" ...\n\nI can see it appealing to some MTV-type crowd or some that desperately cr ave something original (which it is) , but gives me nothing to \"digest\" once over, VS something one can really connect (and sink his teeth into like : The Shawshank Redemption, Gattaca, American Beauty - that one is a rose, by any other name ...\n\nAnd it **Certainly** doesn't deserve to be in the Top100 of all times !\n\nEnjoy the show, Folks !\n\nJerome M."

It was so unexpected, non-linear and unique, it absolutely blew me away. Watching it again nearly thirty years later, and it is still a masterpiece. Quentin has undoubtedly delivered films almost as good, but none better. 10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie meant a lot of changes for the entire industry, the unusual way for telling us a story, main characters with unique personalities who exudes tons of charisma, the music and photography take us back to the 90 years ... and we can't ignore every single detail that Tarantino placed in the whole movie is probably more essential than we thought. It's not a coincidence that many directors use Pulp Fiction like a guide for making their movies....\n\nIt could be taken as a cliche comment, but Pulp Fiction is an obligatory date for every person, it doesn't matter what kind of movies are your favourites, trust me, this movie could hardly dissapoint you."

        "review_detailed_main": "Even after watching it a hundred times, it's an enjoyable ride. We are thrown in a few different stories which are interconnected. We meet a couple of hitman, their boss and his wife, two robbers and a boxer that's over his prime. The dialogues and monologues consume quite a bit of the time, but they are so great that we end up craving for more. They give you a pretty good idea of who the characters are and what they stand for. It's something we've come to expect from every Tarantino movie, but it was done especially well in this one. The star filled cast is just unbelievable. It's amazing how they all leave their distinct mark in the story. All in all, in Pulp Fiction, we get Tarantino at his best: bloody, dirty, funny and simply awesome."

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie tells us that in life, violence, including wars, boxing, and other forms, is ubiquitous, and there is no justice to life, death, right or wrong in front of it. Under the cover of violence, the film actually explores a more profound issue - the impact of accidental events on human destiny.\n\nThe three stories mentioned in the script, \"Vincent and Marsha's Wife,\" \"The Golden Watch,\" and \"Bonnie's Situation,\" are actually one story. Mia's drug overdose, Butch's encounter with Martha, Jules's \"miracle\" and robbery in the restaurant are all accidental events in life, and it is these seemingly accidental events that change the fate of the characters."
