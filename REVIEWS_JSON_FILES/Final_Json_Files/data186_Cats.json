        "review_title": "A disastrous show of pompous and inconsequential gibberish, garish visuals and tedious storytelling",
        "review_detailed_main": "I've got nothing against movie musicals, director Tom Hooper, or even anybody who's a part of making this film. But goodness me, Cats is an absolute monstrosity. Garish, non-sensical, boring and everything in between, it's a pompous and pointless musical that plays out with barely a redeeming feature, proving one of the most unbearable cinema experiences I've had in a very long time.\n\nWhile I haven't been a big fan of Hooper's work in the past, particularly Les Mis\u00e9rables, Cats pales in comparison to anything the director has made before, failing on all levels in its pathetic attempts to provide even a semblance of fun, magical theatre, and instead staggering along through its repetitive and frankly tedious story on its way to a terrible ending that can't come soon enough.\n\nThere's nothing positive I have to say about this movie. Les Mis\u00e9rables, for all its faults, at least had a degree of spectacle, emotion and drama, whereas Cats is little more than an experiment gone wrong: a horrifying Frankenstein's monster that attempts to blend modern cinematic techniques with classic West End storytelling.\n\nFirst, the visual effects are extremely offputting. Whether it's the uncanny CGI human/cat-like figures, the inconsistent and distracting scaling and sizing issues, or even the plasticky, garish look of the whole film, Cats is a really unpleasant spectacle. And for all of the technical expertise that clearly went into pulling it off, it all feels squandered on a misguided and painfully showy movie.\n\nNext, Hooper's directing is jagged and meandering throughout. While the screenplay is hardly a work of art, Cats lacks even the slightest bit of show-stopping stage energy, symptomatic of direction that leaves the film wandering aimlessly right the way through.\n\nHooper's visual style is uninspiring and unimaginative, the musical and dance numbers are repetitive and dull, and even the biggest, best dramatic set-pieces are completely missing any sort of real presence, instead just fading into the movie's jarringly inconsistent structure.\n\nThe pacing is a massive problem throughout, as the film shirks the need for even a basic three-act structure in exchange for a horribly repetitive yet still inconsistent layout. Basically, for two hours, it goes like this: Dialogue, mini song, big musical number. Dialogue, mini song, big musical number. And repeat. Again and again and again.\n\nIn that, Cats proves so boring, so predictable, and clearly so without life that it's happy to just sit and move you from one musical number to the next. A great movie musical should organically blend song and dialogue, with each complementing the other with the goal of developing the story wherever possible.\n\nCats is so aimless and repetitive, that the pathetic excuse for a story barely seems to move at any point. Instead, it's just a vehicle for big West End musical numbers on the big screen, all built up to in jarring fashion that makes each song more awkward than the last.\n\nThat story, too, is almost unbearable throughout. I won't pass judgment on the original stage show, but in the case of this film, the plot is non-sensical, the characters uninteresting, the screenplay unfocused, and the emotion painfully superficial.\n\nA little bit of fantasy is fine by me, but when a film is constantly repeating its fantasy mumbo-jumbo about cats being sent to heaven or something or other, it gives no incentive to keep watching, worsened by a total lack of character focus or even a consistent main lead.\n\nFrancesca Hayward plays the young, new cat to join the tribe, so you'd think that she would be the main focus for the story. However, the movie is so distracted by trying to cram in as many A-listers and side characters as possible that the whole thing feels like an endless meet-and-greet, still introducing new characters deep into the latter stages, and not even giving a second to let Hayward's cat take centre stage.\n\nThere's no story because it barely gets going. For what feels like an hour and a half, the film jumps between random characters' introductory musical numbers, and then, remembering it has to wrap things up in a two-hour window, abruptly shifts to tying up loose ends that were never really established in the first place.\n\nAs a result, despite the immense acting talent on display, none of the characters are memorable, and none play even a leading role for you to connect with at any point. Alongside Hayward, there's Robbie Fairchild and Laurie Davidson, both of whom seem to be on screen enough to warrant a leading role, but neither even gets the slightest bit of attention from the screenplay.\n\nSo, whenever their characters take any sort of role in the main plot, it comes across as sudden and out of left-field, a problem only caused because the movie spends so much time trying to entertain you with A-listers dressed as CGI cats. But even for all the Taylor Swift cameos in the world, it's surely not worth steamrolling simple character and narrative development.\n\nIn short, Cats is an absolute atrocity. From a director with an already wobbly track record in the musical genre, this film is an utter disaster, failing to capture any sense of spectacle or fun, and instead meandering and wandering through a non-sensical, boring and predictable story that's seemingly used mostly as a platform for some big West End musical numbers and A-list cameos.\n\nThere's nothing good to say about Cats, and unless you really want two hours of pain at the cinema, I suggest you stay as clear as possible."

Cats pushes those effects right off a cliff into the uncanny valley. The design and look is freakin disgusting.\n\nI never saw the stage musical, so I didn't know what I was in for. This movie that has no plot, it's just a bunch of random cats introducing themselves. I tried to enjoy it as a so-bad-it's-good cringefest, but the lack of plot and the terrible effects make it impossible.\n\nIf you can't even look at the screen without feeling annoyed & disgusted, it's impossible to enjoy it in anyway.\n\nThanks Tom Hooper."

In the days to come, I looped the trailer over and over. I couldn't get enough. When the movie came out, I bought the first ticket, trampled a girl to get in, and sat in the first row. And all my sadness dissipated. It was beautiful. In that moment I had an out of body experience. Seeing Judy Dench lick her leg and watching Taylor Swift being slightly less annoying than usual all combined with James Corden was too much. I got home that night and threw out all my meds and curry. I didn't need them anymore. Since then I have devoted myself to watching the movie five times a day while sitting on my head. I am the proud owner of so many cats, I lost count. My neighbors think me strange and Dad said something about disowning me, but it matters not. I have all I need. I no longer shower so I can make time for this glorious masterpiece. The sight of Jason Derulo crawling around alone is enough to wash my body clean enough for years. My hair practically cleans itself now. I can only hope you experience this meowsterpiece in the same way I did. Cats gets a 10/10. It's the least I can give it."

You are that uncomfortable as you sit through it.\n\nWhoever gave the final go-ahead to make the cats look the way they look does not know what cats or people look like. The characters do not look quite feline enough and do not look quite human enough. They fall into a gray area somewhere in between and we call this \"the uncanny valley.\" This movie is more horrifying than \"It: Chapter 1\" if you are a coulrophobe.\n\nI would rather it were \"Spiders.\" You would at least know what you're getting into then and I cannot stand spiders.\n\nThe most nightmarish moments are after certain songs when the cats start meowing or lapping milk and water out of bowls. I felt like the Nazis at the end of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\" I thought my face was going to melt off.\n\nMy friends and I went to it after laughing at all the bad reviews because we wanted to make fun of it, but it's so visually horrid that it held us tight in its Uncanny Valley grip for the whole of its two hours. Who in the production department looked at the finished computer generation of the cats' appearances and said, \"That looks good. Let's go with that!\"?\n\nIf you go, DO NOT TAKE YOUR CHILDREN. This movie will horrify them far more than anything Pennywise the Clown could come up with."

        "review_detailed_main": "Outside of a few extremely weird moments, CATS is neither as consistently weird as you want it to be nor as good as the film thinks it is. You get used to the CGI after 5 minutes and after that, it's just the stage show. If you like that, you'll like the movie. I liked the movie a bit more than I liked the musical (for reasons that will become apparent) - but I also really don't like the musical.\n\nThe script adds a bit more of a story than what is found in the musical, but it's never really able to turn the film into anything more than a collection of vignettes where various Cats explain why they should be the ones to ascend to the Heaviside Layer (a version of Cat Heaven) and be given a chance at a new life.\n\nThe CGI isn't as monstrous as you fear, though there are plenty of times it doesn't work. Hooper films this movie in exactly the same method he filmed the Les Miserables film - lots of extended closeups and very long-lasting wide shots. The wide shots do a good job at showing off Andy Blankenbuehler's choreography, but the closeups are very unsettling.\n\nUnfortunately, the movie is only REALLY weird for about 30-40% of the time. The rest of it is fairly monotonous and it just sort of numbs you. I'd argue it's worth seeing for those weird moments - because they're REALLY weird. But, at the end of the day, if you don't like the musical, there's no chance you're gonna like this movie - because it's just the musical with slightly weirder costumes."

Tom Hooper has put together a star studded cast, created a coherent plot that links together the various musical pieces and it's a great experience. It starts off slowly but once it kicks into high gear, it's mesmerising through to the end. Just like the stage play it makes little sense, street cats gather to perform for the old matriarch Queen cat. She will decide which of them deserves to be elevated to a new life. Makes no sense but neither do cats in real life. The effects are great and yes they are cat people, THAT'S THE STAGE PLAY TOO!!! In a world where we are happy to have Bradley Cooper voice a humanoid Racoon but we freak out about people looking like cats then I have to suspect all the fuss and negativity surrounding this is just false offence. It's not got a huge amount of replay value but it was great and definitely worth catching on the big screen. Francesca Hayward was fantastic as Victoria, her dancing is incredible, Idris Elba was menacing as Macavity Jennifer Lawrence has some serious pipes. For me, one of the standout performances was Robert Fairchild as Munkustrap. Does it say anything about our humanity? Does it have a deep rooted message that will change you? No. Does it showcase the weirdness and self indulgence that your household cat, sitting across the room from you, quietly judging you, displays on a daily basis? Yes."

And though it's taken many years, that festering sore has finally burst through the skin with Jennifer Hudson's rendition of Memory in this shockingly unpleasant movie version of a shockingly unpleasant stage show.\n\nTo be fair to the makers of this abomination, the source material they had to work with is the real problem here - a painfully stupid and tuneless musical based on a collection of poems about cats, the writer of which could never in his wildest dreams have imagined someone would make into a stage play. Why would they? The answer is the key to everything that's wrong with this movie : over inflated ego.\n\nIt is gargantuan ego that put Taylor Swift, Idris Elba, James Corden, and others to sign up to this and not demand to be edited out after seeing the final depressing version. It is ego that makes Rebel Wilson think she can be the same character she is in everything else she's ever done and she will be funny (spoiler: she isn't). But even these graphic demonstrations of colossal self delusion pale in comparison to Hudson's hilarious performance.\n\nTo be by far the worst thing about the worst movie possibly ever made is in itself notable, but to quite obviously think you're by far the best thing in a profoundly important masterpiece is ego that mere mortals like you and I can only ponder on. Hudson viciously and sadistically tortures every note of Memory the way anyone with a musical bone in their body has always wanted to torture Andrew Lloyd Webber. It is the only laugh out loud moment of the whole show, and believe me, I was not the only one in the cinema laughing.\n\nWhat is interesting about all this though is that it makes us take a look at ourselves. We sometimes like to think of actors we've liked in various things as good folk who we'd enjoy having over to dinner, even though we've never met them. But what this movie shows is that our beloved thespians are in fact scrabbling back biters who would do anything for a feed yet think themselves superior to us and each other (and yet they all had so much trouble pretending to be cats...).\n\nAnd that's the sad part. Taylor Swift, James Corden, Jennifer Hudson, we already knew about. But Idris Elba, Ian McKellen, Judy Dench - we see you now. And we won't forget. And nor, Ray Winstone, will the owners of Bet365. But do keep begging them to take you back. It's the only option you have left after this."

I thought despite the bad reviews and creepy previews that I could still find some joy in this movie as I have been able to find joy in many things in my life. However, I got ten minutes into the movie and my body wouldn't let me get up out of the chair, I was paralyzed as the horrible images, ear destroying songs, and dialogue that seemed to be written by a mentally challenged dodo bird was forced upon me. It has been several days since I left that theatre and I will not go into specific details, but my actions have lead to my family leaving me and my cat no longer being with us. Something has taken over my mind that I never though possible, there is such anger filling me that and I feel myself falling into a deep and dark hole with no chance of escape, even the thoughts of cats remind me of the horrors I faced in that movie theatre and there is nothing I can do to stop it. I fear that I will never be the same again, all I can hope is that my mind will repress the horrid memories that I have endured over the last couple days. I beg of anyone reading this...

Yes it's weird, and at times boring because the songs just keep bleeding into each other, but overall its an entertaining spectacle that kids will like. Not nearly as bad as people have been saying. The Mr Mestophalies scene and the scene where she sings memory are the two best scenes. You cant fault the dancing performers or most of the singing the sets and vfx are solid for the most part and it's actually really impressive technically. It's fine."

It's also full of (mostly) lackluster musical numbers featuring songs with nonsensical lyrics. To put it simply, this film is litter-ally a cat-astrophe."

        "review_detailed_main": "Honestly, if you are a true theater lover / dancer you can embrace this movie. I've been a fan of Cats since a small child (talking 4 years old) - and I have also had the wonderful fortune of seeing a production live as well as performing in one as a singer and featured dancer. I felt this adaptation was pretty well thought out and executed to a great level for the big screen. It had the playfulness and musical power of the stage production (thank you, Andrew Llyod Weber, executive producer and executive music director) with all of the performers really embracing their roles and performing at an amazing level. You get so much more context from this movie and there seems to more plot line then in the original story. I loved the added dialogue to create the context - and loved the character choices of Idris Alba and the director Tom Hopper to bring Macavity more to life then in the original Broadway production. I felt every actor and actress in this version executed their characters very well (thank you to Robbie Fairchild as Munkstrap - my fave cat!)- but an EXCEPTIONAL shout out to Jennifer Hudson who embodied such a beautiful version of Grizabella! (Memory made me cry) As far as CGI - if you can go to a Marvel movie and see Josh Brolin as Thanos and have no issue or see a \"youngified\" version of Michael Douglas then why is there such an issue with seeing performers as cats in CGI?? When I performed in the show it was leotards, wigs with Cat ears, loads of make-up and tails that swung around lifeless (while sometimes getting caught during the dancing) - at least in the movie version we get tails that are interactive. So inconclusion, I could continue to rave about each individual character, the settings, the directorial choices, dance, etc. but I leave with: if you are a theater nerd or you are a dancer this movie is for you.\n\nDANCERS: Les Twins are featured and the Jellical Ball is PHENOMENALLY executed.\n\nBut Haters got to Hate I guess....."

It was magical, transfixing and entertaining. Every bit as good as the Broadway production on the video that I own. I finally tracked down the 2019 version by the idiot Tom Hooper (I shall avoid all movies by this idiot forevermore). I have no issue with the set design, the actors, songs or dances. But rather the ridiculous, hideously creepy CGI he chose to do instead of traditional costume, hair and makeup. Seven minutes into watching the horrible mutation of cat on human body with a human face is just too nauseatingly disgusting to watch. The whole charm of the Webber stage production was the enchanting and magical makeup and costumes that transformed humans into cats. Hooper should be forced to watch his abomination over and over and over and over again for at least a year and then never ever allowed near a movie or tv or even theater stage ever again. The man should be blacklisted and should lose his equity card and shunned from Hollywood, Bollywood, Broadway, TV and if he ever shows up at a community theater he should be tarred and feathered and run out on the rail."

I'm aware that it's something to behold, an event devoid of any particularly defined plot or purpose. That's the charm of the performance, after all, right?\n\nWell, yeah. But that doesn't translate to a film. A group of human beings in cheap costume with low-grade CGI prancing about without a purpose on a movie theatre screen doesn't work. It's not a performance of the broadway show; it's a feature film and in that venue it fails miserably. The talent that was employed for this production aren't showcasing their strongest efforts, the main name (Taylor Swift) was literally put in to sell tickets to the movie; her character ultimately does nothing for the film.\n\nI really don't care that there's a \"new song\" or that there's a \"big budget\" put into this movie. All the money in the world can't take a concept that works good in one medium and make it into a good film. This performance belongs on the stage and on CD. As a film it's bland and it leaves nothing but a horribly vile taste in my mouth. This movie is a real hairball, no question about it. I wanted to chase these cats away with a spray bottle.

So, consider this when you read the review.\n\nAs to the movie, it is one of the biggest disasters in recent box office memory, as the film was pretty much hated by everyone...including fans of the play. And, after seeing it, I can see why. Apart from a song here and there and the train dance number, pretty much everything about the film is terrible...especially its waste of talented and expensive stars. Many times, established stars are given songs that simply aren't good fits for their skills. The biggest example that comes to mind is Rebel Wilson....who I loved singing in other movies. Here, she just isn't that good...and it just goes to show you talented and likable stars are not going to work if the producers are out of their minds. A few other things I disliked about the film would include the creepiness of the characters, generally bad CGI (the opening scene shocked me how rotten it looked), Idris Elba looking naked (and super-creepy) towards the end of the film as well as the really creepy and awful cockroach scene.\n\nThe bottom line is that this film was a chore to finish....and I found myself asking my family if they really wanted to finish the movie! It lacks fun, quality and a sound reason for being made in the first place. This film simply needs to be put to sleep."

The cats are vying for the chance at a new life by being chosen by Old Deuteronomy (Judi Dench) at the annual Jellicle Ball. I will admit there were a couple of weird moments, like when Judi Dench raises her leg in the air after watching Gus the Theater Cat's performance (played sweetly by Ian McKellen). But I thoroughly enjoyed all the performances, the dancing, and the singing. Jennifer Hudson performing Memory as Grizabella will make you tear up, I don't care who you are.......

It's just one bizarre musical number after another.\n\nSecondly, the CGI really isn't as awful as people are making it out to be. Some bits looked a little off, but it wasn't distracting at all. In fact, at times, it was glorious to look at. The set designs were beautiful, and the way the actors moved was captivating.\n\nI can see why people may not like this movie, it's definitely not to everyone's taste, but it's not a bad movie by the time you judge talent and direction.

        "review_title": "The Weirdest Musical Movie You Will Ever See...But It Will Make People More Curious About The Actual Musical",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Cats\" is a 2019 film based on the long lived 80's musical stage performance by the same name. It tells the story of a tribe of cats needing to decide yearly which one of them will ascend to the Heaviside Layer and come back to a new life.\n\nAlright so this happened, I saw \"Cats\" even after absolutely hating the trailer for this movie. I don't need to explain why I think the human-to-cat CGI is visually terrible looking, because it is. Yes the musical has strange visuals as well, but it works as a stage performance. Why? Because were expecting oddness, we know these performers are humans dressed as cats. The key word is \"dressed\", because I fully believe that this movie would've been a lot better if the team behind it just put them in costumes and prosthetic makeup like in the musical. It probably would've been SO MUCH CHEAPER too! I don't understand what the thought process was for this, other than to try and amaze audiences which backfired horribly. So were stuck with human faces and unproportioned lips that shift due to horrible MC, human hands and feet that levitate off the ground at moments and detached looking ears and tails. It's a mess.\n\nMoving on past the CGI because I could go on all day, I will say the sets were semi-impressive considering they were actually built. Which again furthers my disbelief as to how they built actual sets but chose to CGI skin-tight catsuits onto actors, but I digress. The musical only takes place in a junkyard, so this movie expands upon the smaller feeling scale of its source material which is nice. Also the story is quite loyal to the musical, and yes there is a story. Could Tom Hooper have stretched out the story to be more suitable to audiences? Yes, but it wouldn't of been \"Cats\" then. The musical is literally a character study, going through each cat (kind of like an initiation ceremony or talent competition) so we the audience get to know them through personalized song, rather than have Munkustrap (our main narrator) describe absolutely everything. It's interesting and each of the cats does have its own personality, we also get to see the smaller plot of which cat gets to be the \"chosen one\" and be reborn into a new life.\n\nThis kind of loose plot doesn't really work in a film, which is why noone asked for this to be made. I still don't know who was the intended demographic for this film, other than fans of the musical I guess? The casting is well done (for the most part) ,however some actors were clearly cast just to pull in more viewers and not for talent or appropriateness. Rebel Wilson was awful, very unfunny and didn't embody Jennyanydots's character at all, whom is weird and quirky. James Corden was pretty bad too as Bustopher Jones, though not quite as bad as Rebel Wilson. He presented the character more on point at least. The last bad fruit in the basket of the cast in my opinion will probably offend many. I couldn't stand Taylor Swift's Bombalurina performance in this. First of all, she's shown in the trailer quite a lot because she's a huge selling point, but is barely in the film (one song's worth and doesn't even return at the end). Secondly, her song sounded terrible and I think it was the worst in the film tieing with Rebel Wilson's. I couldn't tell if she was trying to impersonate a british accent while singing, or if her tone was just all over the place? Maybe both! Lastly, her CGI looked the worst to me out of anybodys. So that just pushed the illusion the film was trying to create further out the window.\n\nEveryone else either did alright or surprisingly better than I expected. Newcomer Francesca Hayward did very well and I feel awful that this is her introduction into film. Jennifer Hudson killed it as Grizabella, though I wish she would've had more screen time and they changed her approach to Victoria. In the musical she's desperately trying to have someone touch her in order to be taken back into the tribe, but in this that moment doesn't happen. Which bugged me more than it probably should have. Idris Elba did well as villain Macavity and Jason Derulo was okay, he just didn't stand a chance against the live actor though in the 80's musical film. My favorite character portrayal was Mr. Mistoffelees though, Laurie Davidson did really well and I hope to see him in more! Everyone else was kind of just alright in my opinion, they either didn't bring enough character to the roll or I just didn't really care for them to begin with. The music was faithful and for the most part sounded good so oh well, though the newly added song I didn't care for because it stuck out like a sore thumb.\n\nHonestly, if you want a true showing of \"Cats\" just watch the 80's musical movie adaptation. It's pretty good and close-up so you can see all of the details put into the performances. This movie will probably garner some kind of following, I've already seen fanfiction drawings of Victoria and Mistoffelees. Which probably resulted from this movie surfacing and pushing that \"romance\" more into the light, but it doesn't really bother me. Tom Hooper has definitely become of those directors that either makes massively successful films that acquire acclaim or real failures that people hate. Which is fascinating. If you have a morbid fascination with this film, go see it! If not don't force yourself to, you'll want to leave and regret spending money on an overpriced theatre ticket."

I can't stop starring at their feet. They didn't even try to make it look a little real. No depth of fiel, nothing. This just makes all the dancing and moving so unnatural.\n\nSome songs and voices are good but the overall movie is just really bad. I wanted to leave after 20min but my mom paid for the tickets and I don't want to be disrespectful.\n\nI don't think this should have ever been adapted for the big screen. Because of all the reasons above but I also think it's just too theatrical and just doesn't adapt well. I have no doubt this would be 10x more enjoyable played on a Broadway stage.\n\nStay away from this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sometimes in life we all ignore that quiet still small voice inside us, that voice with wise judgement urging us to make the right decision, sadly for me I recently ignored this inner voice and my want to see what has been called one of the most downright bad film's of all time is a case of curiosity almost killing the (Eddie) cat.\n\nI, like many others had no great desire to see the cinematic adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage musical Cats, especially after witnessing the close to frightening trailers, that for some reason decided to mould felines and humans into some form of monstrously designed evil hybrid but after all the press proclaiming the depths of despair this film sinks to, I felt it was my duty too catch it first hand.\n\nWhat I and other viewers are greeted with is a film so lifeless and devoid of any form of spark, that it's nigh on incomprehensible that not only Oscar nominated director Tom Hooper is the man responsible for this crime against film but that he managed to secure 100's of million in cash to make it and recruit an A-list cast to partake in its follies.\n\nHow any sane person could read the Cats script and think it was going to turn out in a reasonable way is beyond me, as Hopper and his writing team lead this almost entirely song and dance experience through a plot that doesn't even pretend to have a story.\n\nThere's certainly visions I will never forget, that much I can give the film, images such as James Corden lapping up delicious treats with his cat tongue, Sir Ian McKellan meowing seductively to the camera, Jennifer Hudson's runny nose and Rebel Wilson eating human cockroaches are but some glories but trying to figure out what is happening in this jellicle madness is not worth the brain power.\n\nAfter a seemingly never ending opening song and dance number that almost sends you off the deep end before the shows even really begun, the tale of Francesca Hayward's abandoned cat Victoria and her night out on the town being introduced to all manner of fluffy friends is two hours of pure tedium and pain as we begin to not only question the films existence, but that of life itself.\n\nThe whole experience is supposed to be a fun and colorful trip to an extra ordinary feline world but despite some undeniably great costumes and set design, this family rated feature is akin to some type of Lovecraftian horror trip as we traverse graveyards, milk clubs and back alleys on our quest to find out who indeed from these cats is the most jellicle.\n\nTowards the end of Hopper's disasterpiece, Dame Judi Dench's cat matriarch Deuteronomy stares directly at the audience and proclaims about what we have all learnt throughout the last few hours, it's a bizarre ploy, a scary and uncomfortable ending to a film that needs to be seen to be believed but one that I beg you not to ever watch, let that curiosity go and don't make the same mistakes I did.\n\nFinal Say -\n\nCats is truly unlike anything we've ever seen before and I trust we will never see again.\n\nA plot-less, painful and embarrassingly bad big budget extravaganza that will live long in echelons of epic Hollywood failures.\n\n0 snooty noses out of 5"

And one of the guys is a ballet dancer and tap dancer in London. I commend them for their talent especially his tap dancing skills. You could tell he had been tap dancing from a very early age. WOW! Jennifer Hudson singing Memories was excellent. Her singing is so soulful. Taylor Swift sings Beautiful Ghosts and I enjoyed it very much.

During one song, I started off a little disappointed, but by the end of the song, enjoyed it very much. At a few points near the end, I got emotional and had chills. The plot line was very understandable for those who have never heard of it. If you enjoy musicals, dance numbers, and Broadway-style solos, the movie is worth your time. It was a movie I would watch over and over and recommend to friends. Actors did a phenomenal job and obviously Jennifer Hudson was amazing. Quite a few \"new\" actors who did a wonderful job as well.

However, the lure of seeing something truly terrible and then being able to write a scathing review proved too irresistible; to that end, I wasn't disappointed (plus, the viewing was free for me: I won an Unlimited cinema pass earlier in the year).\n\nImagine all of the roller-skating locomotives of Starlight Express speeding down their ramps and flying off the stage in unison, landing in a crumpled heap in the front row, arms and legs twisted and broken: Cats is an even bigger train wreck than that. Putting aside the frankly bizarre sight of well-known performers with CG cat ears, fur and tails, the film is still 100 minutes of 'what were they thinking?' with a sprinkling of 'who the hell likes this stuff?'.\n\nA nonsensical plot (based on T.S. Eliot's 1939 anthology, Old Possum's Book Of Practical Cats) strings together the baffling musical numbers, of which there are many. The word 'jellicle' gets said an awful lot, but no-one explains what it means. It's not unlike a wild fever dream, with bizarre imagery, strange performances and lacklustre song and dance routines pummelling the senses until the final act, in which Jennifer Hudson's snivelling, runny-nosed Grizabella screeches her rendition of Memory (more painful than a cat making itself comfy on your lap) before disappearing into the sky in a chandelier suspended from a hot air balloon.\n\nJames Corden is as unbearably irritating as I had imagined and watching Rebel Wilson effectively naked except for a layer of fur is hard to take. On the flipside, Taylor Swift as Bombalurina is hot despite her all-over hair, and easily the highlight of the whole sorry mess.\n\n2/10 for Taylor Swift, but I almost deducted a point for the mice and cockroaches. Human-like felines are a stretch; anthropomorphic rodents and insects are a step too far."

While everyone was good in their own way, some impressed more than others. My favorite number and performer is probably Skimbleshanks the Railway Cat featuring Steven McRae followed by Mr Mistoffelees with Laurie Davidson and original song Beautiful Ghosts sung by newcomer Francesca Hayward. Also delightful with their turns were James Cordern as Bustopher Jones, Rebel Wilson as Jennyanydots and Jason Derulo as Rum Tum Tugger. A lovely surprise was Taylor Swift who wowed as Bombalurina, proving her early doubters wrong that she could carry off that role. The part of Old Deuteronomy, played by male actors in the stage versions, was given to Dame Judi Dench; she who became the first female M in the Bond franchise also did justice to this dignified role. Haters who decided not to like or love this movie before or after viewing it will find any reason or excuse to hate it. As for me, watching this Cats on the big screen left me \"feline good\"."

And why do they have human hands and feet? They all look like lab experiments.\n\nSomeone needs to tell Jennifer Hudson she doesn't need to try so hard. She's putting way more effort into this movie than it deserves. And they also need to wipe her nose.\n\nJudi Dench has been nominated for eight....8!.....Academy Awards.

Almost.\n\nIdris Elba, you are the stuff of my nightmares.\n\nI don't get the scale in this movie. Sometimes the cats look like normal human size, but then they'll be dwarfed by something like a a dinner plate and then I'm like, wait, either that cat is really small or that dinner plate is really large.\n\nHaving human heads on tiny little mouse bodies was a terrible idea.

        "review_detailed_main": "Greetings again from the darkness. Director Tom Hooper must really enjoy this process. In 2012 he brought mega-hit stage musical LES MISERABLES to the screen. It was nominated for 8 Oscars and won 3, including one for Anne Hathaway. This time, Mr. Hooper again turns his talents towards a colossally successful stage musical, and costumes, make-up, and visual effects are even more crucial. Whereas Les Mis was adapted from Victor Hugo's novel, CATS was adapted by songwriter Andrew Lloyd Webber from a 1939 poetry collection of T.S. Elilot. Of course, Mr. Webber is also the genius behind other brilliant musicals, including THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (from the novel by Gaston Leroux).\n\nTom Hooper and Lee Hall have adapted the screenplay from the stage presentation, and the sung-through musical approach means there is minimal dialogue. Songs are used to tell the story and introduce the key characters. Choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler (a 3-time Tony winner, \"Hamilton\") is the real star. Multiple dance styles are featured, including: classical ballet, contemporary, hip-hop, and traditional tap. The dancing is tremendous, and of course, a big part of that is Francesca Hayward, who plays new kitten on the block, Victoria. Ms. Hayward is a Principal Ballerina at The Royal Ballet. Numerous other skilled dancers are in the cast as well.\n\nThe story (such that it is) revolves around a tribe of Jellicle cats who have an annual ritual of selecting one to ascend to the Heaviside Layer and come back with a new Jellicle life. Sweet Victoria is unceremoniously dumped in the alley by her owner, and is quickly surrounded by this tribe of cats that basically aren't very nice. It's in this opening sequence where we realize these humans as cats actually look a bit creepy and take a while to get accustomed to. Given the structure, the story plods along through each successive song, with certain characters getting their moment to shine. These include Rebel Wilson as humorous and chunky Gumbie cat Jennyanydots, Rum Tum Tiger cat played by talented musician/singer/dancer Jason Derulo, Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson as outcast Grizabella, James Corden as the usually-hungry Bustopher Jones, and Oscar winner Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy. Always hovering, is the mystical Macavity played by glowing-green-eyed Idris Elba, and making a later appearance is Taylor Swift as Bombalurina, singing the Macavity tribute song.\n\nThe two most memorable numbers come courtesy of Ian McKellan as Gus the Theatre Cat, and Ms. Hudson who belts out the most famous song of the production, \"Memory\", in a vocal and emotional highlight of the film. Visually, it's Mr. Mistofelees (Laurie Davidson) magic number that breaks us out of the muted palette. The other musical numbers mostly just fall flat and aren't very entertaining or enjoyable.\n\nIt's pure coincidence that the screening for this film was the same day as the new Star Wars movie. The franchise for the latter began in 1977, while \"Cats\" first hit the stage in 1981. That's quite a legacy for both. As for this film version from director Hooper, I do wonder if enough viewers will respond to a musical where the story and songs are overshadowed by the dancing, and the sets and costumes offer no 'wow' factor. Many will find these characters hard to connect with ... at least outside of that incredible Jennifer Hudson vocal. It seems these kitties should have remained on stage."

The way the cats moved varied throughout the film (walking on two feet or four feet) and I noticed a few errors in the sizes of the cats compared to their props & scenery.\n\nAll of the sung parts seemed to be recorded 'dry', without any acoustics appropriate to the setting of the scene, which really spoiled the realism for me. Sounded just like the actors were in a vocal booth, two inches from the microphone.\n\nSeveral people walked out of the cinema halfway through, and I don't blame them.

HOWEVER, having said that, I loved it. The producers didn't stray too far from the original musical production. I was afraid they would try and rewrite it to make it more commercially palatable. I LOVE the CGI fur and ears on the actors. You can see they tried very hard to mimic cat movements. The actors are actually able to sing their character parts. They didn't just throw a well known actor in and hope they could sing. Rebel Wilson sounds like a perfect Jennyanydots - waver in the voice and all. Munkustrap (who narrates the majority of the show) has a very clear tone and can carry any part he needs to. I was happy they didn't try and shove TayTay at all of us - she has a very small part all things considered. Francesca Heyward is lovely as Victoria. Her dancing skills show off the power AND grace needed to carry the main character. Jennifer Hudson's version of Memory is mature and moving. Memory is notoriously difficult to sing and singing it well is just that much harder. All in all this version gives a bit more \"story\" to the musical. You get to see Victoria's interest in Grizabella and her compassion for Miss Griz. Dame Judy is brilliant as always even though she cannot sing as strongly as the rest of the cast. Since she plays the sage older Deuteronomy it makes sense. This should be up for best special effects or costuming. The ears especially give so much expression to each cat. If you have seen the Broadway version you will understand why sticking close to the source material is important. Each cat contributes to the flow of the story - even the chorus cats. Most of them have actual names (Bomburlina, Coricopat, Syllabub). In the penultimate action Mr. Mistoffelees is adorable and you can see the confidence build. He is much more shy in the movie than the stage production but it works really well in the growth of his relationship to Victoria."

Cats 2019 feels like someone tried to digitize a Broadway production of the play, but the computer focused too much on face recognition. The choreo and singing feels straight out of the musical, no modern hip hop remixes here. All the main cats get their own songs,and they may just be only introducing themselves and that's it,but they're all done well, and I enjoyed some of it a lot, especially the opening number. 'Memories' actually brought me to tears,something that doesn't happen very often. The obvious elephant in the room is the CGI, which,yes,does look freakish at first,but by the last third, I didn't care. This isn't the holiday smash hit the studio was hoping for, but when you realize that it is currently going up against Star Wars, there is little hope for this to make much of a mark at the box office."

The music is appalling and there's nothing at all to sing along to and no catchy tunes whatsoever. That's a big fail for a musical. The 'lyrics are boring and uninspiring and tbh half the time I could not make them out anyway. The acting is appalling. I honestly thought Francesca Hayward's 'character' had a rigid face for the first half hour as hers never changed. You can tell she's a ballerina but her posh poses had no place as a cat. She should have been taught to dumb down her posing. The CGI wasn't very good. The sets all looked as if they were going to be great but had not yet been finished off. The very human faces were too human, they were human faces on cats' bodies, bizarre. They should have cat-ised the faces so that they suited the bodies. And boobs on cats??? Rebel is a big lass, they should have dealt with her breasts in CGI to make them more cat like. Finally, the story was crap. It was long and drawn out at the start and then amounted to nothing. I admit I didn't watch the final part (maybe 20 mins or so) I honestly just couldn't bare it any longer. Conclusion: Everyone should watch this movie just to see how bad movies can actually get."

Personally I found Jason Derulo disappointing and although Judy Dench was good in her role, I would have cast Brian Blessed as a nod to the original west end production, of nothing else than his wonderful performance of The Ad-dressing of Cats. I'd say don't listen to the haters, give it a go with an open mind, you just might love it, if so then you live the theatre production even more!"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Cats\" is such a strange film. If it had taken a much, much simpler, stripped-down approach, it could have been charming and sweet. Talk about gilding the lily: the filmmakers chose to pile on the CGI, and along with it a lot of unnecessary dialog and additional \"plot\" to this paper-thin musical. The Broadway show is a silly string of funny songs with one poignant ballad thrown in; the movie strains to add an actual storyline for no particular reason.\n\nTo be fair, some of the performances are just fine, particularly Francesca Hayward, who does a marvelous job with her songs and is wonderful to behold in her dance scenes. Those bright spots are few, though, with truly awful, broad, unfunny vaudeville from Rebel Wilson and James Corden. Wow, are they bad. They act like friends watching the movie will be impressed, as if they're in a high school play and need to ham it up. Will Rebel Wilson ever star in a role that doesn't feature her constantly hurting herself, doing pratfalls and smacking herself in the face?\n\nA scroll through this IMDB page shows you just how many people were involved with the creation of this film. How much money and effort could've been saved here, just approaching the light, cute source material with simplicity."

I didn't really mind the CGI of the actors' faces, maybe it was thought that something like that would be demanded from today's audiences. or was it just that Taylor Swift and Idris Elba couldn't dance? But for me it was a minor thing and didn't interfere with my enjoyment at all. There were only 2 things that I'd have changed: someone should have got Jennifer Hudson some better crying eye drops, as her runny nose was off-putting, and Idris Elba as Macavity's fur could have done with being a tad longer as Idris Elba looked as if he had no clothes on, but no bits as it were \ud83d\ude40.

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw cats last night. Most likely am going to see it again sometime this weekend. Critics are so full of crap its not even funny. First off the sexual comments that every critic seems to be saying. What does it say when critics are finding something to be sexualized more then furries? There was a kitchen scene was god damn nuts. I was uncomfortable with some of those camera angles on Rebel Wilson and some of the implied self thigh rubbing....*coughs* Yeah well. And the less said about the mice and cockroaches the better.\n\nBut beyond that umm no. They are cats + ballet + musical. I'm getting the impression that folks who went to see this film to review it have never seen a ballet or stage musical before. Just because you grab someone by the waist or are in close quarters with them doesn't equate to sexual.\n\nI think critics are confused because this is where the term anthropomorphic comes into play. You have people who look like cats who are acting like cats and it's causing problems with \"reading\" the body language of the people in the movie. This is all on the director and choreographer.\n\nA lot of the reviews are saying the CGI is bad. Umm no. Not at all. The fur is perfect. The complains about some of the actors wearing fur vs some are just naked. First I saw someone complaining about being neutered. Do you really want to see anatomically correct cats in this movie? Are you sure you aren't a closet furry or something? The choice to go with characters wearing outfits and some not.....look at who is dancing. The folks who do the most dancing are the ones who are \"naked\" The main characters who are not dancers are the ones who get the outfits. This is purely a functionality thing. Both it saves on the cost of CGI and it allows the dancers more freedom to move.\n\nNow my philosophy has always been if you have to explain that the movie was actually good, it probably wasn't.\n\nThe above simply explains away some the critics baffling statements. But don't mistake that for me thinking this was a great movie. It wasn't. It was OK. It was fun to watch.\n\nThat said there was plenty wrong with this movie. For the plot.....Its Cats. The plot has always been almost nonexistent. They could have, and should have expanded on that. Was it bad? No. Its a straight forward concept. New person thrown into a new situation so the audience is learning about her environment as she is learning. A cat at the end of the evening is picked to.....move on by Judi Dench during that time cats are auditioning to be picked. During that time plans are afoot. This is not a complicated plot. Its a plot designed to carry music numbers in it from A to B to C to D. That is all.\n\nNow one suggestion would have been to added a little more Disney musical in that the music numbers are interspersed with dialog. To give a bit more breathing room between the music numbers as I think it was breaking the poor critics brain.\n\nNext was the cuts in this movie. A lot of, IMHO, bad edits. Jennifer Hudson when singing the iconic Memory was cutting away from her for reaction shots. It broke the mood. There are other examples of that that felt like the camera should have lingered longer. Speaking of Jennifer Hudson. Wonderful job but, and it was mentioned by another review that I rolled my eyes at but is legit. She cries as she is singing. Sure. Fine. While it brings emotional weight to the scene......we really didn't need the runny nose. Really it was distracting to see that.\n\nThe interesting thing that I found with critics. Is there are factually inaccurate statements in their reviews. Things that can be quantified. One review complained about the lack of locations. The only major change in location was a railway track on a bridge. Other then that it was just an ally and a theater. That is factually inaccurate. I counted 10 distinct locations. So why the inaccuracy. I suspect that folks were so intent on the cat characters (Ears moving, tail moving, fury moving.) that it distracted from actually paying attention to the film. I wasn't bugged by this because its anthro cats....So? I think anyone not furry needs to see this at least twice. The reviews are blasting this movie when I've seen far worse movies with far worse CGI, far worse stories, and far worse characters all the while getting far better ratings. What's the difference? People are losing their crap because its people CGI morphed into cats."

This is pretty much a CGI 2020 Cats, with a few weird additional changes, some pacing that could have been faster, and some less impressive vocals. But honestly, I don't understand what was so upsetting. Has anyone seen the original? It makes very little sense to begin with! It's a musical about Cats that has honestly defied all logic for decades anyway! If you're a fan, I feel like you got what you were expecting. It was FINE. Not great, not awful. Fine. My biggest complaint was Jason DeRulo robbing the Rum Tum Tugger of literally everything that made the song and the character what it all was, but other than that, calm down. Seriously. This was not the worst 2 hours I've spent in a movie theater this year. I can name 20 movies that were more painful."

The cast is generally excellent and their enthusiasm helps invest in the characters.\n\nThere are some miss-steps along the way. Interrupting some of the songs disrupts the rhythm. Some of the SFX don't work well and a couple of sequences don't work to well.\n\nCats succeeds non the less in being highly entertaining and memorable."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've seen the stage musical and it's one of the worst out there; it's built around one great song, Memory, and that's all it has going for it. I had no expectation that the film would be better, but was instantly intrigued when the first images came to light. The translation wasn't at all what I expected, but I was ready to take a trip to that uncanny valley.\n\nNow, having seen it, it's quite the spectacle, and not in the way it's intended to be. The CGI is all over the place and it's astounding that they released it in the shape it's in. Faces move, but heads don't move accordingly; bodies look like they're floating, with the feet so manipulated by the effects they don't actually look like they're touching the ground; bodies look distorted to the point that their movements look artificial, when so much effort was put into the choreography. The problems are just so evident.\n\nYet, while watching this chaotic mess of a film, I found myself enjoying every moment. It's like a game, where you start looking for what's wrong in each frame, and there's plenty to uncover. Sure, the cast looks like they're having a decent time, but wondering why none of them thought twice about this being a disaster also supplies some sort of excitement, because it's the kind of bad that is actually fun to experience. I'm glad this exists. It's full of wonder and mania, fluctuating between terror, confusion, and amazement, often in one fell swoop.\n\nEmbrace the curiosity, grab a drink or four beforehand, and just succumb to this marvelous piece of eventual cult cinema that will be giffed for decades to come. If anything's certain, you've never seen anything like this before and it's hard to imagine anything else coming close to it anytime soon."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm well behind with my reviewing following the Christmas break, so I don't have much hope of coming up with anything new for one of the most critically derided films of the year . . . but let's try anyway. I have been to see the musical, staged by a reputable touring company, and frankly I hated it. This is not some reaction to the genre, I've seen a number of them, and I like musicals. But \"Cats\" is an artless, plotless, pointless show, with one half decent song and lots of hideous synthesizers that betrays its 80's inception. The film is actually better than the musical in one sense, but in many others is a garish, embarrassing fever dream.\n\nVictoria (Francesca Hayward) is a young cat tossed into the streets by an unseen owner. She meets the various cats that live on the streets of London, around the theatre district. She comes on a special night though, as tonight is the Jellicle ball when the show off in an attempt to convince Old Deuteronomy (Judy Dench) that one of them deserves to be reborn.\n\nSo, I think I've already cleared up what I think of \"Cats\" the musical. The best production in the world would still be the worst choice you could make to spend your time watching and the movie is pretty far from the best production. It does have one improvement. Rather than just two hours of characters introducing themselves, there is a bit of a plot now! Idris Elba's McCavity kidnapping his rivals to make himself the most likely Jellicle choice. Smart. Like it. In terms of other positives. . . .erm . . . I suspect, if you like Ballet, you'll get something out of some of the dances. Maybe.\n\nThose meagre positives don't come close though to making up for the hideous other worldly visuals of the CGI blending of the actors with bits of cats. . . sometimes it's little better than a snapchat face-swap app. Scale of the characters varies wildly, depending on the scene and in hardly any of them is comparable to an actual cat. Corden and Rebel Wilson are terrible in their roles. Jason Derulo can at least sing, even if his character is as embarrassing and everyone else's. Jennifer Hudson steps all over \"Memory\" with an emotional performance that comes at the expense of the song.\n\nPeople are going a little overboard with their criticism, it's not the worst film ever. It's probably not even the worst film of the year (though I admit I'm struggling at the moment to think of one) but it is pretty awful."

It could've been better, especially with more dancing, but the music stays true to the Broadway and West End classic, and the newly injected plot is a nice and slightly cohesive add. It's fun, nonsensical, and a pleasant way to spend a rainy Sunday afternoon."

They've clearly not seen the original which is just as bizarre and slightly confusing (in a good way). It is not striving for a crystal, intricate plot, it is artistic in choreography, music, set, the use of CGI - not straying too far from the original but has added in a clearer way of seeing the story and wonderful casting and a beautiful new song. Jennifer Hudson's performance of Memory was extremely emotional just as the original. Not only was it beautiful, it was entertaining generating frequent laughs and a constant interest. People should see, appreciate and praise this film."

        "review_detailed_main": "A few days ago, someone on Twitter joked that the reviewers who had just beheld Tom Hooper's Cats on the big screen sounded like Lovecraftian protagonists. I tend to agree, as I recently read on Facebook: \"When you see these things switch between acting like people and acting like cats, you'll think you mistakenly read a page of the Necronomicon Ex Mortis\".\n\nWhat sort of dark, dreary mistake must've been made in our history that it came to the point where this... thing... was green-lit by a major studio? Who is this for? Is this what fans of the original musical want? Are kids supposed to enjoy it? Adult furries?\n\nFurthermore, what is it that is so goddamn difficult to understand about live-action remakes, especially the ones with talking animal characters? When we panned the Lion King remake because its photorealism subtracts the magic and expressiveness of singing felines, we didn't mean you should try doing singing felines in live-action AGAIN but this time with characters that are some sort of unholy alien hybrid between man and cat, and can therefore emote slightly more. What we meant, more so now than ever before, is STOP!\n\nCats, as most of you are cursed to know, doesn't dress its dancers up in kitty costumes as per the original stageplay's tradition, nor does it opt for Disney-style CG animals in the place of actors. Instead, it sort of blends the two, giving us digital furry counterparts to Taylor Swift, Idris Elba, James Corden, Jason Derulo, Ian McKellen, and Judi Dench, just to name a few.\n\nI don't why digital adjustments needed to be done to these poor performers, as opposed to giving them real-life kitty suits. It makes us suspect that the dancing isn't wholly authentic (computers might have added some magic there), which is a shame since one of the leads is Francesca Hayward, dancer at the Royal Ballet, in her film debut. She has played everything from Alice in Wonderland and Sleeping Beauty, to The Sugar Plum Fairy and Juliet Capulet. She deserves far better.\n\nAside from the night-terror visuals and accompanying cat-person noises, there isn't much to write home about here. If one can get used to the film's agonizing/agonized universe and excuse the possibility that we're not beholding wholly undoctored dancing, it's still pretty useless.\n\nThe story (such as it is) is the story of Cats, plus some dumb jokes (thanks Rebel Wilson), celebrity cameos for generations Y through Z to enjoy, and other things that stretch it thin. The lovely but narratively useless songs from the Andrew Lloyd Webber production are there, plus some new additions to ensure a Best Original Song nomination, because that's what remakes and adaptations of musicals do, I guess. Hooper's Les Miserables film did it; the Beauty and the Beast remake did it; the Aladdin remake did it; now this.\n\nThe best thing to come out of this film was a mashup someone made of the Cats trailer and the unsettling Annihilation soundtrack, partially because it was funny, but mainly because it confirms that random Internet users often have a more solid grasp of what makes a good movie and which images go with which mood than Hollywood professionals. Put some obnoxious Benny Hill music over the recent Rise of Skywalker and we have another example.\n\nSadly, I fear the best meme material we got was from the initial trailer. Some fans and cineasts speculate that film studios are doing this on purpose; creating meme-worthy magnitudes of ugliness to help spread the word of their movies. There's even a theory that Sony's non-hideous redo of Sonic the Hedgehog was ready to go before the Internet had torn the initial design a new one; they just wanted the film to reach meme status first. That sounds a little too smart and 21st century-savvy to be true, though."

        "review_detailed_main": "My Review Cats - my Rating 8/10.\n\nAs anyone knows who reads my page I like musicals and have acquired some knowledge of this genre over the years . There have been some woeful Screen adaptations of famous Stage musicals eg A Chorus Line (1985) Man of La Mancha 1972 ,Camelot 1967, A Little Night Music 1977 to name a few.\n\nThe 2019 Tom Hooper \" Cats\"does not deserve the vendetta of bad press by so called Professional Critics who I think don't understand the genre of the film musical at all.\n\nI'm taking time over my Review as I want people to see this film ,it will polarise some people . I went with my regular film partner and he didn't care for it.\n\nI on the other hand enjoyed it very much I had read a little of the bollocking this movie is receiving and also a review yesterday from a friend who also knows the musical stage and film genre so I was so pleasantly surprised to be in the minority camp of people who praise this innovative reworking of a stage musical . Cats has already been filmed in 1998 with the original Griizabella Elaine Paige .If you want to see cats filmed in a studio pretty much as it was on stage the 1998 version may appeal more to your tastes .\n\nIf you expect to hear the best vocal version of the hit song from Cats ,Memory sung by Jennifer Hudson you won't hear it in this version but her performance as the tired bedraggled and world weary Grizabella is the best acting performance I've seen of anyone in this pivotal role I can understand why her version is so full of pain.\n\nI notice IMBD give the 1998 version a 7.6 Rating and this new version a measly 2.6 ?\n\nIt's terribly unfair and doesn't give credit to the acting and technical expertise that has gone in to this production.\n\nThe 1998 version while authentic to the stage production doesn't expand the horizon of the wonderful world of Cats or add anything new the 2019 version does.\n\nCritics can unfortunately ruin a films prospects at the box office I hate the phrase some friends use \" oh I didn't go and see it because it got rotten reviews \" I always say make up your own mind I've seen so many enjoyable movies that the critics have panned and I've seen some very average films that some critics wax lyrically about.\n\nThis new version of Cats directed by Tom Hooper ( The Kings Speech, The Danish Girl, Les Miserables) who also was a screenwriter with Lee Hall on this project features some great talent and magical moments . It's a very different setting to the stage production which was basically a big rubbish tip. It pays homage to other screen musicals ,especially Busby Berkeley and Mrs Henderson Presents. Dame Judi Dench was Mrs Henderson and that film was set in The Windmill theatre which also features in this as a set for Cats.\n\nThe rest of the scenes are in London itself in various locations like Trafalgar Square The Thames and a fabulous production number performed by Steven McRae as Skimbleshanks the Railway Cat on a rail bridge to a great London station.\n\nFrancesca Hayward a Royal Ballet principle is wonderfully cast as Victoria the elegant timid White Cat who is dumped in the alley where the tribe of Jellicle cats are competing and waiting for their one of them to be chosen by Old Deuteronomy to ascend to the Heaviside Layer and come back to a new Jellicle life.\n\nThe plot is basically just that and it's based on a collection of poems by T. S. Elliott . Andrew Lloyd Webber's songs introduce all the characters like Bombalurina, Macavity, Mr Mistoffelees , the magician played so well by Laurie Davidson. James Corden as Bustopher Jones the fat cat in spats is fun Rebel Wilson as Jennyanydots is Rebel Wilson.\n\nIdris Elba as Macavity the villain of the piece is also very good in the role.\n\nTerrific choreography very different in parts to the stage production in fact it's the younger less known actors that are the Stars of this film apart from Dame Judi Dench and Sir Ian McKellen. Dame Judi I think is wonderful as Old Deuteronomy in fact her final scene in Trafalgar Square moved me to a few tears. Ian McKellen is also wonderful as Gus The Theatre Cat and both these veterans of British theatre add great pathos and class I imagine the rest of the young cast must have felt privileged to be in this film.\n\nIf I go to see a film adaptation of a musical I want it to be more intimate than the stage version and to transport me and inspire my imagination. I didn't like Tom Hoopers last musical film Les Miserables mainly for live singing if you can call Russell Crowe's voice singing but also because to me it lacked intimacy ,but I must say he has won me over in his latest musical Cats.\n\nPlease Ignore the negative critical onslaught on this film adaptation of Cats ,make up your own mind . The estimated cost budget of this musical is USD 95,000,000 you can see every dollar spent in the sets and production numbers .The film is doing very poorly due to bad press and deserves a much better reception I hope for the sake of future musical films it does succeed."

Now I went with my partner and his daughters who only thought it was OK but they've never seen the original or watched many musicals. So my review is if you're a big cats fan like me then you'll love this, if you've never heard of it before today or not seen the original then you'll not enjoy it as much."

And most surprisingly there were some really weird visuals that left me with my jaws agape. Crazy.

It looks awful (it actually made me feel sick). The CGI looks like it was done by a drunk film student. The cinematography is awful and covers up the choreography (the only thing the movie maybe had going for it). There's a cut like every 2 seconds and it is way too zoomed in half the time. Even the music with all the celebrity voices and talent behind it, is bland at best. Also the singing and sound mixing is done in a way that you can barely understand the lyrics, which is important given that the movie is ENTIRELY SINGING. Yeah, that's right, there is no dialogue in this movie, and you can only half understand the singing. It doesn't even matter, considering the movie has like, no story. There is nothing, and I mean NOTHING good about this movie. Don't see it.\n\nLove Musicals? Don't watch this. The music isn't good, and the choreography is covered up. The story is awful. I wouldn't even listen to the music on Youtube. Watch ANY other musical movie. I like musicals myself. But this? No.\n\nLike Cats, the musical? Don't watch this. I've never watched Cats, but based off of what I hear people like about Cats, this takes away anything you could've liked about Cats (choreography is covered up, costuming is gone cause its all CGI, and music is bleh)\n\nThink it'll be funny to riff on? No. Don't. Do anything else. Don't make the same mistake I did. Go out for dinner with a friend. Take a nice stroll. Play video games. You could stay in bed all day for all I care. My life is worse after watching this movie.\n\nIt might sound like I'm overreacting, but I promise you that if you see this movie, you WILL regret it. Please. Just Don't."

Don't get me wrong I love Judi Dench and Ian McKellen but I don't think they can sing, and for a movie that is basically one bit song they didn't work for me. The CGI was good in most parts of the film but there was some parts where their faces didn't match with the heads and one part where Mckellens eye just looked wrong! I have no idea why or how?

Humans dress up as cats and sing a mixed bag of songs and it's sort of a fabulous hot mess. If this premise is for you, then you'll like it. If it's not, you won't. (See also: Cats the musical.)\n\nIncreasingly we are allowing ourselves to be pushed towards extremes of opinion on everything, and it's ruining our ability to see the shades of truth in between. The CGI in Cats bothered me far less than De Niro's waxy face in The Irishman (a film I liked far better than this, in spite of its needless miscasting).\n\nThe scale problems didn't bother me much because I just suspended disbelief. I'm watching a movie in which cats sing, so really I'm not looking for dimension realism.\n\nJennifer Hudson belts THAT note out, and it's a bit of a moment, but I'm not sure her sobbing throughout the song was the appropriate creative choice for the lyrics. But Judi Dench has bags of cheeky fun, and Laurie Davidson is a charismatic Mr Mistoffelees.\n\nHonestly, I left the cinema feeling like I'd seen a perfectly OK movie which couldn't be a lot better because the inherent source material isn't all that brilliant.\n\nTo dismiss it outright, or enjoy kicking some pretty decent performers and dancers who enter into the spirit of it, isn't an especially balanced form of criticism."

Who gather once a year to see which of their number will be given the opportunity to ascend to the Heaviside layer. Cats the movie is a slick, computer-enhanced celeb-fest with meticulously choreographed set-pieces taking place in a version of London .\n\nFrancesca Hayward's 'Victoria' a Principal Ballerina at the Royal Ballet takes centre stage in this remarkable portrayal of the original West End production of Cats. She is not exactly verbose, but her eyes talk plenty, wearing a nonplussed expression throughout as she tries to figure out what in the name of Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats is going on. The score compliments the original 'Webber' magic and stays basically true to the stage musical.\n\nIf you want a visual feast, knowingly camped up performances from a stellar cast and some beautiful dance & musical numbers this film is a winner. A very well made sentiment to the original stage musical that those who have seen the West End musical will understand totally."

No one thought to themselves that a movie about cats was going to be a little on the, I dunno, weird side?\n\nFirst and foremost, the cgi was a little ratchet, but you get past that after a short time. Now THE singing by Jennifer Hudson was purely beautiful and brought tears to my eyes! The song, Beautiful Ghosts, written by my girl, Taylor Swift, and sung by Francesca, was hands down my favorite part. You could feel and understand the pain and beauty behind those two characters and it was magic. It literally filled several movie goers eyes with tears with how good it was. Did i mention Jennifer Hudson's singing of Memories \ud83d\ude2d oh, i did.. \ud83d\udc40 BEAUTIFUL AND POWERFUL.\n\nOne thing i would have liked better and yes i know it's based off a theater production, but more dialogue because some of the singing was... confusing and hard to understand when attempted to be sung by these A-list celebrities. Would have been a nice transition from theater to a movie adaption. My 9 year old daughter at one point whispered to me, \"mom, why are they singing the whole time..\" lol\n\nAll in all, it's not that serious y'all. It's a movie about Cats, not a hero saving the world. It's fun and entertaining and enjoyable to watch. The dancing is fun and most, not all, of the songs are great.\n\nDid i mention my girl, Taylor Swift?! \ud83d\ude1d"

        "review_detailed_main": "People here love to pile on and criticize a movie without any indication they actually saw the movie. There is not a single fact about the movie in most reviews.\n\nThe Good The movie did remain relatively faithful to the original Broadway plot. Of course people may not like that version - but that is the story for Cats. The music was largely the same as the Broadway show with one new tune co-written by Lloyd Weber and Swift - and that tune was not bad. The CGI had some misses, but overall was pretty good. The people turned into cats worked well. There were some great sets.\n\nYou can't complain about Francesca Haywood. She's very talented and is a principal ballerina for The Royal Ballet. Her acting was pretty good, and she made the movie.\n\nJames Cordon did an excellent job. Robbie Fairchild was very good. Judy Dench was not perfect, but overall I liked her and her role.\n\nThe Bad Jennifer Hudson had the best song and provided a terrible job of delivering it. Terrible. With all of her emotional gymnastics, the melody of the song was gone. Her song - Memories - is the most important number in the production. Disaster.\n\nTaylor Swift was irrelelevant. Her character had a 5-6 minute appearance late in the move for a single song. Who cares. The song was okay - an original she co-wrote. But she added nothing to the movie other than a name.\n\nOverall, the sound quality of the music was poor - and not as good as a typical live theatrical production. With the budget and the talent available, you expected better. It seemed to have been recorded during filming live scenes with background noise and inconsistent production values.\n\nOverall - I liked Cats. I've seen the Broadway production a couple of times, I knew what to expect, and it delivered. It's about Cats. There is no deep plot or story. Just enjoy it and have fun."

I have read T.S.Eliot's \"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats\" twice. And I have seen the stage musical 4 or 5 times in the 90s and loved it. But a movie gives you close-ups of facial expressions and (feline) interaction that is not visible on a live stage. The music was as I remembered with a few additional songs, and some spoken parts to help the narrative. The actors dressed/CGI'd as cats, is no more unexpected than they were on stage. I don't deny that people who are not at all familiar with the book nor stage production, may find the appearance of the \"cats\" to be unusual, and the songs somewhat disconnected. However, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it and watch it again."

        "review_title": "Okay Musical Remake with Weird/Dark Vibes",
        "review_detailed_main": "This movie has a lot of negative reviews because people were expecting a movie, not a musical. So firstly, understand it's not a traditional movie, but a musical based on the Cats play. This means there is extremely little dialogue; it's basically singing and dancing the whole time. You must have a taste for the theatre arts to appreciate this kind of work. So if you don't like musicals, you'd hate this movie.\n\nIf you judge it for what it is--a musical movie--it doesn't deserve terrible reviews, but it's also not the best either. As a musical movie, it has good choreography, transitions, dancing, singing, etc. It captures the essence of the original Cats play and its weirdness. But it has issues with enunciation, unanswered questions, over-the-top weirdness, and unnecessary dark vibes.\n\nThe actors didn't enunciate words clearly, making it very difficult to understand much of what they were talking and singing about, which also makes understanding the whole plot more difficult. They failed to explain many things in this movie, such as how did they all get there?, who exactly is the villain Macavity,? how is Macavity able to make people disappear?, why is only one cat chosen to begin a new life?, where exactly are they?, what is the Heaviside Layer?, etc. These questions (or most of them) can only be answered by researching the original Cats play, so the movie itself fails to answer some critical questions for people unfamiliar with the original story. This will leave you being very confused about a lot of things.\n\nThis musical movie is extremely weird. People in cat costumes crawling around in all fours, scratching and licking themselves, hissing, and very strange positions. Other weird things like mice and roaches with human faces. The way the cats get close to each other's faces and mouths can be very weird and even slightly sexual. The songs, the background music, the scenes, and various characters are all just super weird! On a weirdness scale of 1 to 10, it's an 11.\n\nThe movie has a dark theme that permeates everything. Dark in a creepy way, like Tim Burton style. Every scene is dark in some way. They constantly interrupt the musical flow to make it sound dark/creepy again. It goes back-and-forth with normal music/singing then sudden dark/creepy again, as if you were watching a horror movie and something bad is about to happen. These constant dark/creepy vibes are completely unnecessarily and damaging to the movie.\n\nThe biggest question of all that we had was: where exactly are they? All these abandoned cats live in some dark city that they can't escape unless they are reborn by reaching the \"Heaviside Layer\" by singing about their lives. So in summary, you can think of this movie as \"Tim Burton makes a musical\" where human-cats are trapped in some type of Cat Hell/Purgatory who have to competitively sing and dance their way out. It's one super weird musical, but not terrible. It's about a 6.5/10."

The designs are beautiful, the perfect blend of realness to believe it in modern film world while not going too over the top & keeping the people's features. I never saw the show before this, so can't speak to the adaptation aspect of it; but it seems a lot of people hated this ultra successful show and hated the film adaptation of it following similar paths of supposedly dumbing it down for a broader appeal. Don't get me wrong: it's not a great movie, but it is (for a limited audience that will find it beautiful) memorable and worth a watch. Performances by James Corbin, Judi Dench, Ian Mckellen & another amazing performance by Jennifer Hudson is worth the price of admission alone. There's not much plot and it runs a bit too long, but has many strong moments. Does not deserve the 2.7 outta 10 it has on IMDB or the 30 of 100 it has by critics. In my mind, it's better than the poorly shot Les Mis film and the awfully bland La La Land, which were fawned over in years past."

The movie has some of these issues but I ended up sort of liking it. The makeup on the people wasn't that bad and everybody could sing, act and dance. Also there was some startling set designs--it certainly LOOKED great! I almost did walk out about 30 minutes in when a number with singing mice and tap-dancing cockroaches (I'm not kidding) started up but I stayed. It got much better after that. Most of the songs were unmemorable but I loved \"Mr. Mistoffelees\" and (of course) \"Memory\". Also Jennifer Hudson was superb in her role. She sang \"Memory\" so beautifully I started crying. So it's not a great movie but it's certainly not the bomb people are saying it is."

Jason Derulo is an abysmal Rum Tum Tugger, but Sir Ian McKellen is a great Old Gus. Jennifer Hudson has no weight as Grizabella, but James Corden is an alright Bustopher Jones.

        "review_detailed_main": "Look, this musical is a product of its time. I do not think it is fair to judge it outside of this context, because when it first opened in the 80s, it hit record breaking popularity for a reason. That is why so many stars signed on for the project. But why, why in Heaven's name did they not just put them in costumes and makeup? WHY!? They could have at least taken a note from Disney and designed anatomically correct cats with dubbed voices. Instead they chose to spend ridiculous amounts of extra money for hideous CGI to overlay the human performers. It will not matter how many times they rerelease the film with \"improved effects,\" it is never going to blend as well as, oh I don't know, the simple faux-fur that had been successfully used on stage for nearly forty years! How can anyone enjoy the impressive singing and dancing when the rest of the film was such an ugly visual distraction? It was an awful choice, and blatantly ruined the final product.\n\nThe writing didn't fair much better. Some people complained over the lack of a story, but I believe it had the opposite problem. In an attempt to appeal to a larger audience, the adapted script tried to shoehorn in a comprehensible narrative into what was otherwise intended to be a concert musical. For one, those who weren't already familiar with CATS were never going to like it to begin with. Two, if there is anything good to say about the original stage production, it was that the lack of cohesion made it delightfully abstract. Adding linearity, filler dialogue, and character subplots stripped it of all its fun while including extra layers of uncomfortable campiness to boot. CATS was never a masterpiece, but it seemed like the producers said to themselves, \"I bet we could do worse.\""

Every choice made while adapting this was just wrong. They had the budget to make them all real cats. Or, if they HAD to use people in costumes, why did they go with this abominable hybrid that makes everyone involved look stupid? I understand you have to perform in some silly situations when CGI is involved, but they emphasized the cringe inducing behavior. The CGI did nothing but add to the monstrosity this ended up being. There is no amount of drugs in Hollywood that would have made this seem a reasonable effort. This was some kind of practical joke, or someone had some serious dirt on the cast and crew, as I don't know how any professional was involved in this. Maybe James Corden."

If you weren't scared of cats before, watching this will soon change that. Whoever thought it was a good idea to take such loveable furballs and turn them into these CGI human-cat hybrid abominations should never be allowed to work in the industry again. They're truly terrifying creatures.\n\nThe only positive for this film, aside from the fact that it does eventually end, is that you can tell the choreographers and set designers but a lot of hard work into their jobs and they really don't deserve to have their work associated with this mess. But that isn't enough to justify a score higher than 1.\n\nOn a side note, why does James Corden continue getting work? He isn't a very good actor, he can't sing and he isn't funny, yet he keeps appearing in films and TV. This has to be one of the biggest mysteries in the universe."

Every song is delivered with excellence by some of the world's most well-known artists. There are comical twists and turns but I found myself indulging in every single song.\n\nAs for the story - this musical follows a very simple, linear narrative - a newly stray cat walks central London as she is introduced to a whole host of new cats. Each cat character has it's own musical performance. It's in keeping with the original theatre version. I found the linear movement from one cat to the next worked in the films favour - focusing on the music without trying to invent any kind of elaborate story line. It truely is a beautiful musical.\n\nAs a piece of entertainment, if you like musicals then you will love and quite possibly be overwhelmed by the musical magic offered here. If you don't like musical theatre then Cats has little to offer you. This is where critics have stepped low with ratings: rating Cats as a story for the masses - rather than as the simple musical it aims to be."

In addition, the film had an impressive cast.\n\nThe plot is a bit confusing and meager. An abandoned cat is joined by a group of cats who are preparing for a talent show... for cats. The judge (played by Judi Dench) decides who gets to go to the cat heaven (Heaviside Layer). In fact, the film is mostly a presentation of all the characters and their \"talents\". Even though the film is bad, it is still not a disaster as many claim, though not far from it. I appreciated the cinematography, the sets and the lighting and the color scheme. It looked much like an advanced musical in theater and not a typical Hollywood movie. But that's where everything that was okay ends. The effects, the plot, the script, the dialogues, yes everything else is really lousy. Pretty close to a cat-astrophe. Yet, this movie will go down in history, but not in a good way."

Eliot's charming stories. I was accompanied by a neighbour who loves her own cats, and we had both seen the stage musical many years ago. The production uses CGI to enhance the costumes and movements of the human cast, and I think this works well. The performers are clearly still human beings dressed in cat costumes, which seems to be a look that some reviewers can't accept. I presume that some of the negative reviewers might prefer cartoon animation, but I reckon that what this movie does works well. It isn't Tom & Jerry, or James Bond, or Star Trek, or romantic comedy, or of any other conventional genre. This is a different kind of movie, and I suggest for a different kind of audience: ideally cat-ladies who have seen the stage musical at least once."

I found Judi Dench to be a bit touching and for this version that is my sole positive comment. Everyone else is simply ridiculous and that one good song is sung is ruined. This is about as big a misfire of a screen adaptation of a Broadway hit as I can imagine. It is positively beyond me how so many talented people thought this could work."

It really has no story. It is a song and dance show with performers in form fitting spandex costumes with tails, ears, fur and makeup. The movie takes the show and heightens that spectacle with realistic sets and locations. In place of the spandex, it is now CGI fur and tails. It's not any weirder than the stage version.\n\nWhat I loved about the movie is the fact that there is a story now. It is seen through the eyes of Victoria. I loved the changes to the script to really connect the cats. Adding to the Macavity story and making him more present in the story. Victoria's journey with Munkustrap as we meet all the Jellicles. Mr. Mistoffelees getting a stronger story line added so much to his solo song.\n\nThe performances were amazing. Robbie Fairchild was perfect as Munkustrap. His vocals, dancing and acting performance really helped to draw the audience into the story. Ian McKellen's Gus had me in tears. His performance is truly stunning and the work of a master craftsman. Jennifer Hudson's Grizabella was phenomenal. It was so emotionally moving. Francesca Hayward was incredible as Victoria. Her portrayal was so innocent, graceful and her Beautiful Ghosts was so haunting."

        "review_detailed_main": "Tom Hooper's 'Cats' (2019) is the worst musical I have ever seen. It really pains me that the director who made one of the best musicals of all time ('Les Mis\u00e9rables', 2012) now comes along with one of the worst ones of all time!\n\n'Cats' is a film that is hugely problematic on so many levels! As far as the musical numbers are concerned, there are 2 good songs (if you count the outro, perhaps 3), the rest is completely irrelevant and such a waste of your time. The storytelling is basically just not really there, it's included in the totally forgettable, unspectacular and boring songs.\n\nIt cannot be stressed enough just how stupid the entire film is! The concept of the story is actually quite interesting, it deals with the reincarnation process. The huge problem is the execution! The story can be found within the songs, HOWEVER these songs are mostly inaudible! It is so hard to understand anything and quite frankly, you just don't really care about anything because you are so distracted by the ridiculous look of the cats!\n\nThis has to be one of the weirdest and most confusing films I have ever seen in my entire life and I have seen some really weird stuff, but THIS took it to a whole new level! Taylor Swift was a bit of a marketing gimmick since she is barely in the film. James Corden played the only cat who I found remotely interesting. While Jennifer Hudson's character was not appealing to me whatsoever, her musical and acting performance on the other hand was outstanding! She put so much emotion into her role (specifically talking about one song at the end) that I almost thought that I should care more. That's how good she was!\n\nAs one critic put it (and I paraphrase), \"This is the worst thing that happened to cats since dogs\". You know what? That's a great statement that totally applies for this peculiar situation!\n\nWith that, I will come to my conclusion! Overall, 'Cats' is a horrific musical that could have been much better, yet the film suffers from an identity crisis. It doesn't know whether these characters are supposed to be cats or humans?! At the end of the day, you see human beings in cat costumes acting like they're cats and it is horrible and very cringy to watch as well as really unsettling overall! 2/10"

The audio mixing is atrocious, songs that could've worked such as Memories suffer because of it. The CGI, it goes without saying at this point. How a director like Tom Hooper with a cast full of great actors churned out this is beyond me. Why did anyone think this was a good career decision? With most terrible Hollywood films; even really terrible ones I can understand the intent behind them, this movie is special. It may be the worst movie because it perplexes me more than any other ever made. A movie made by an Oscar winning director, starring Ian McKellen, Judi Dench, and countless others exists in the form it does. It would be more accurate to say it wasn't released it escaped. Nevertheless, I recommend any aspiring film buff watch the film just to see what can go wrong, and what not to do."

Wrong, it's the worst moment of the entire movie, it was way over done, it's NOT a stage show, it's a movie, but the director thought he did the sad sappy thing in Les Miserables and \" let's repeat history again\" and no need to build up her character !!! And then, the makeup, costumes, choreography ? >>> way way way TOO SAFE!!! Especially the choreography. I would pay double of what I paid for this movie just to watch a dance-scene of a Bollywood movie.

The sets are mysteriously beautiful. But I think I was most impressed with the dancing choreographed by Andy Blankenbuehler and the dancers especially Francesca Hayward and Les Twins. But IMO all the Jellicle dancers put on an amazing show, so much so that there were moments in the film when I kind of wished director Tom Hooper had followed some of the full-cast dances a bit slower. But then again there is something to be said for Hooper's Infectious whirling effect. The singers are as good as the classic songs. Taylor Swift is a flirtatious Bombalurina who sings the nasty Macavity's (good job, Idris Elba) theme song as well as parts of \"Beautiful Ghosts\" & the full version over the end credits. . Jennifer Hudson's tortured, emotional version of \"Memory\" works wonderfully most of the time, especially at the end. This \"Cats\" casts Victoria in the starring role of an innocent homeless kitten rescued by some of the Jellicle tribe. I don't want to be a spoiler so I'll just say Victoria has some adventures as she gets to know individual Jellicles, some more than others. She follows one of Grizabella's \"Memory\" preludes with a sweet and touching version of \"Beautiful Ghosts\". If I try to comment on everyone and everything that makes Cats Cats this would be a very very long review! So just a few more. The comic relief provided by various cast members was uneven, some good, some \"meh\" but these short scenes do make Cats more entertaining and give audience members a chance to catch their collective breath. The most marvelous \"performances by an actor\" were Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy and Ian McKellen as Gus the Theatre Cat. There is something so warm and inviting about Dame Judi's facial expressions; she was covered with just the right amount of digital fur so that the audience could be moved by them. Sir McKellen is a treasure.He plays an old, seen-it-all actor reminiscing about his long theatrical career with a sense of pride and joy in his craft that is genuinely moving. Thank you, Andrew Lloyd Webber and everyone who brought this feline magical mystery tour to the P.S. A quick comment on the \"trailers\" ~ having seen the complete movie, I feel sorry for those whose jobs were to create 3-minute trailers to communicate the merits of this movie. The film contains so much more than can be squeezed into a trailer."

I cant imagine what anyone would expect from this?!\n\nAnd the addition of the song Beautiful Ghosts was just the icing on the cake!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw Cats at the New London Theatre in the early 80s with the original cast and was blown away. Wayne Sleep even sat on my lap during one scene, I was smitten. My parents bought the gatefold vinyl and I grew up singing the songs.\n\nSo when I heard it was being made into a film I was dubious. How can you recreate the glory of a stage musical like Cats? And then it was released to such bad reviews and scorn, I really didn't know if I wanted to ruin my memory of the show.\n\nBut....it really isn't that bad. Yes, it's weird in places but I honestly don't know how they could have made it more \"realistic\" - it's about singing cats....\n\nI loved hearing all the songs again and I enjoyed it. Worth a look if you are a massive fan of the show."
