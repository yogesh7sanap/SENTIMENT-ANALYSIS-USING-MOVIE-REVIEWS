        "review_detailed_main": "Peter Jackson truly outdid himself when creating the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and he fails to disappoint us in the 2nd part of the Trilogy. The Two Towers shows us that he is not a one-hit wonder, like so many directors are. I actually think that The Two Towers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring, and sometimes even surpasses it.\n\nThis film is the biggest film in the trilogy. What do I mean by that? Well this film has so many things going like the amazing Battle of Helms Deep. Frodo and Sam journey to Mount Doom, to destroy the Ring. But the one who's leading them through the way is Gollum, he looks so creepy and realistic, that he doesn't feel disconnected from us. A powerful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum, he should of been nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nThe Best part of the film, is quite easily and everyone knows it the ending. The ending of the battle of Helm's Deep is quite breathtaking, and as Gandalf the White comes in the distance with another army to defeat the Orcs. When Treebeard and his army of Entz tear down Isengard, the destruction and the battle is so immense in size, that you truly have to see to believe.\n\nIn size and scale, Peter Jackson has truly redefined the word \"epic\" and he also pays attention to the small things that truly elevate this movie from great to amazing. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, but you really should watch the first movie to truly understand what's going on.\n\n10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "It seems ridiculous to want to add my own comments to a slew of others that are already in IMDB's records, but I feel like I cannot sleep nor cease the throbbing in my chest until I release some of what I have so recently seen.\n\nPeter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings is one of the bravest projects ever attempted by a filmmaker. Mr Jackson deserves every ovation he will receive, every award, every bit of the praise and adoration that will be spoken and written.\n\nThis second installment of the story is a masterpiece in every sense, forget your prejudices about the books, they are another way of looking at this beautiful story (I know this is slightly against the rules, but a I cannot resist saying that a previous writers comment - a comment that compared the Lord of the Rings Films and Books to the difference between Romeo and Juliet in screenplay and ballet formats - was entirely accurate).\n\nGollum was an excellent amalgam, so easily could he have been an annoying Jar-Jar-Binks-Alike. Instead the way that Jackson and Serkis (and doubtless many many others) chose to portray the CGI incarnation of \"Smeagol\" was incredibly emotive and powerful. Gollum is profoundly disturbing, amusing, almost lovable... Not even John Ronald Reuel himself could induce that range of emotions for Smeagol in me...\n\nA truly skin-crawling performance by a superb Brad Douris as the evil Grima Wormtongue was just beyond words. Douris _Became_ Wormtongue in a skillful fulfillment of what was already inspired casting.\n\nProbably the most definitive casting of this film though was Manchester born Bernard Hill as Theoden, King of Rohan. The casting for \"The Two Towers\" makes one shake ones head and wonder, in retrospect, whether anyone else could have filled these roles. Mr Hill's performance was truly first rate, a performance which contributed greatly to \"The Battle of Helms Deep\", scenes which were a spinning tornado of emotions for the viewer.\n\nViggo Mortensen goes from strength to strength. His performance is visceral and yet sensitive. The overriding emotion that Tolkiens vision of Aragorn induced (at least for me) was awe at his heroics. Mortensen's portrayal in Jackson's frame brings new aspects to the Aragorn character. Mortensen's Aragorn is emotionally dextrous to go with his physical dexterity, he is sensitive, seemingly empathic, warmer and more fundamentally human, and yet super-human in presence and charisma. \"Definitive\" is not strong enough of a word.\n\nIf you still view Jackson's epic with scepticism I implore you to put down your preconceptions and your prejudices, but most of all put down the books... This is beautiful way to see middle earth, don't pass it up - The books are the ultimate fantasy epic - the pictures you draw in your head are better than anything you can imagine, but The Lord of the Rings \"The Two Towers\" is one wonderful interpretation of that epic story.\n\nGo, Laugh, Cry, and Sit in Awe of this cinematic treat."

After 3 hours of sweeping vistas, excellent Shakespearean acting, and otherworldly sights and sounds, we are treated to a scene that still sends chills down my back and rouses me like nothing since the final scene in Rocky. A lone rider (we all know who), set against the top of a hill, massing legions of horsemen behind him. He appears just as the heroes are losing all hope. Once he begins his descent down the hill with his army behind him, the camera begins a slow pan over the top and down with them, showing the size and scale of their forces. The evil army below looks up with surprise, a bright light fills the screen, the camera focuses on the lead rider (again, we all know who) who lets out a wrenching battle cry, the music swells to unbelievable heights, and I am swept away like I've never been before.\n\nThis is cinema at its very best."

The books and the movies alike grasp one's attention as if they were real. You, the reader or viewer, can sense the pain of the characters, their emotions. The trilogy is truly powerful on screen. The second movie, however, I believe has something the first and third are missing; it feels like a bridge connecting two great islands. There is something unique about it that cannot easily be described. Metaphorically, the first movie is, say, a soldier. The third movie is the path home from war. And the second movie is the act of coming home because it contains the obstacles that must be passed through before achieving the goal. Although not 100% loyal to the written trilogy, the movies are done in such a way that the mainstream audience and LOTR fans from before the movies came out can say they were enjoyable and well made."

        "review_title": "The final hour of The Two Towers is grand, terrifying, and epic on a biblical level.",
        "review_detailed_main": "The opening scene of The Two Towers provides an outstanding, yet very brief, taste of action, cinematography, and special effects, only to be matched (and far surpassed) in the final hour of the film. The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.\n\nAs stated, the road to the battle of Helm's Deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. Perhaps The Two Towers' biggest fault is in its own accomplishments; the first two thirds of the film are well shot, well paced, and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline, but when compared to the spectacular final hour, the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. However, to be fair, I feel that it's simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of Helm's Deep. It's difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time Peter Jackson has had to create six hours (so far) of finished film. The battle of Helm's Deep is simply unreal; it's unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained, and regained, popularity.\n\nAs assumed, The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: Frodo and Sam; Aragorn and Legolas, Merry and Pippin, and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film, with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers. Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unquenched in Fellowship. It's much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo; Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. More than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of Aragorn. Gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship, it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film. However, here he is more of a leading character and a 'star,' and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears.\n\nAs was The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers is a visual delight. Those who have seen Fellowship are no doubt familiar with the beauty of the landscapes of New Zealand. The cinematography is, again, one of the best aspects of the film. The swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this post-Matrix era. The shots of the ascending enemy-laden ladders in the battle of Helm's Deep are terrifying and chillingly gorgeous all at once. The visual effects take an appropriate leap forward from those of the first film. While the visual effects in Fellowship were outstanding, the battle of Helm's Deep provides for the best application of CGI since the rippling waves of The Matrix's 'Bullet Time.' The battle of Helm's Deep features absolutely awe-inspiring and seamless integration of acting, stunts, and computer animation. Each orc seems to have its own personality, demonstrated in its movements and visual features. The masses of armies fight with strategy and true character, which I imagine is much harder to accomplish than animating thousands of identical clone troopers. The only problem I have with the visual department is the look of Gimli, the Treebeard. Gimli's visual features seem a bit childish and uninspired, inconsistent with the standards set by the rest of the film. But again, there is simply nothing that compares to the battle of Helm's Deep. George Lucas and the Wachowski brothers certainly have not created anything that approaches the grandness and magnificence of The Two Towers' final hour, and I doubt they will do so anytime soon.\n\nIn The Fellowship of the Ring, I had a few minor problems with Howard Shore's score. While I thought it was gorgeous and it established several very memorable themes, I don't think it handled the sentimental scenes (opening in the Shire, Gandalf's passing) properly. I thought it caved in to the melodrama a bit too much, resembling the emotions from James Horner's Titanic. However, I believe that The Two Towers requires the type of score which Howard Shore accomplishes best: dark, continuous, and unrelenting, as demonstrated in Se7en and Silence of the Lambs. The theme used in many of the action scenes in Fellowship (low brass, six notes repeated with a rest in between) is much more present in The Two Towers, appropriately. A brand new theme is also unveiled, the theme for Rohan, a prominent kingdom in Middle Earth. Rohan's theme is played more often than any other melody in the film, underscoring most of the memorable and heroic scenes with great effect. Howard Shore undeniably exhibits his skills as an 'A-list' composer, and with a possible double Oscar nomination this year for The Two Towers and Gangs of New York, he could get propelled to the very top of the 'A-list,' right beside John Williams and Hans Zimmer in terms of demand.\n\nIf not the picture itself, there should be a way to recognize and award the battle of Helm's Deep. The battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form. The choreography of the battle, the visual effects, the pacing, acting, cinematography, and music, all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be. For this very reason, no one, whether a fan of Fellowship or not, should miss The Two Towers."

        "review_detailed_main": "Really, I should probably let this film soak in a bit; I am, after all, on something of a \"post-viewing\" high right now. However, at this moment, my feeling remains the same from the first installment - this is the movie experience I've been waiting my whole life for. In case you haven't gathered, this movie is visually stunning, literally breathtaking. I mean that, some of the scenes in this film simply stopped my lungs in their tracks, shocked at the pure, enveloping beauty of the shot. Peter Jackson has a profound grasp of visual manipulation like few directors have ever had.\n\nThe acting is, as always, superb. Kudos for hiring \"actors\" not \"stars\"; \"Oscar-worthy\" over-acting could have threatened the realistic touch the film's remarkable cast supply. Specific mention goes to both John Rhys-Davies in his well enjoyed comic turn, and very largely to Andy Serkis, who was a major role in creating the most realistic and brilliantly well-performed CGI character I've ever seen (Gollum).\n\nFor the most part, and as a fan of the books, I take no offense to the slight plot modifications. My understanding is that Tolkien himself realized that visual adaptation of LotR would require a somewhat different take on his work, and was apparently open to such minute changes. There are also a few tiny bits and pieces I was disappointed to see not make the final cut, however, I'm sure a future inevitable extended DVD will take care of those.\n\nIn short, if you found the continual enjoyment I did with the first movie of LotR, this movie will in no way let you down. Not even for a minute.\n\nHighly recommended, 10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "In the Two Towers (TT) we are re-united with most of our heroes from the Fellowship of the Ring (FotR). Split apart by betrayal, and a company of orcs, Frodo and Sam have begun the last leg of their quest to Mordor. Ant and Dec (sorry, Merry and Pippin) are prisoners of the orcs, pursued by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli \u0096 a quest that brings the company, and the people of Rohan, closer to conflict.\n\nOpinion is divided about the second film. The entertainment junkies seem to think it's better than the first, largely on account of the Battle of Helms Deep, which is rather impressive. I thought it was a bit weaker, mainly because, in a wilderness adventure, there's more emphasis on the characters than in the spectacle of set piece action; and because the CGI is less subtle as a result.\n\nOnce again, liberties are taken with the story. There's no riding of the Grey Company. There's a more obvious tension between Eowyn and Aragorn (Legolas has to remind Aragorn who he's dating), and (controversial among the Tolkienites) Faramir's character has been darkened somewhat. In fact, the directorial trait of adding more colour to the main characters while painting out the subtlety of the peripheral ones continues from FotR. Partly because we're introduced to more characters in TT, the overall effect leaves the film slightly two-dimensional. On balance I thought the treatment of Faramir to be less heinous than that of Denethor in Return of the King, but more on that later.\n\nThe mood, though, remains pure Tolkien and that, more than anything, is the triumph of the movie. From the Beowulf-like set for Meduseld (Tolkien famously nicked his description of the seat of Rohan from the UK's first epic) to the majestic sweep of New Zealand, the film more than once reminded me of my own mental images of Tolkien's world. And, once again, I found myself interested in the story.\n\nSo, to the flaws. I mentioned in an earlier review of FotR the astonishing heighism in Peter Jackson's adaptation. You can imagine Jackson scratching his head wondering what to do for laughs now that Ant and Dec have been nicked by Ugluk, Grishnakh and the lads. His solution is ingenious; find the next shortest member of the company. Gimli, therefore, shoulders the mantle of comedy relief. As a strapping man of 6'4'' I am allowed a certain disdainful disinterest to such a phenomenon; but it is worth noting. Also worth noticing is the astonishing transformation of Arwen from a feisty, most un-Tolkien lady in FotR to the submissive pre-Raphaelite stereotype of the books. I guess this is because Eowyn has turned up, but still. The Elves still speak like they're doped up, except the peculiarly immune elfin fancy boy, Legolas. On that note, was it really necessary for him to mount his horse that way? Or surf his way down a staircase at the battle of Helms Deep? Jim Horner should do an alternative Beach Boys theme for that scene.\n\nAnyway, these are minor points in a film that is, if not a major, then at least a minor, triumph. As mentioned by others, the film is worth seeing for Gollum alone. And I can think of many more reasons to see it. You could also check out the extended version, which is even better. 7/10."

It is a CGI showcase, and features good film editing and make-up, however ultimately it is pretty much on par with the first film in terms of virtues and vices. Again, it is visually stunning, but it still is too long, too violent and it is too convoluted in plot. The screenplay is no improvement over the first film in terms of character and plot development, and therefore it is equally as not involving as the previous part of the trilogy. The film features one of the largest battle scenes of all time, but it is also one of the least interesting, as it is just mindless action. It also is a slow and sluggish watch, and in many ways the weakest entry in the trilogy, however if you can separate the films than this would actually rate as the strongest entry, because the special effects in the film are the best and most creative, and in such a visual but not all so compelling film series, this is one of the most important aspects. The visual and audio effects both won Oscars, and out of the three films it is the only one that deserved Best Visual Effects."

Also It's not that easy to fitting that to the adaptation. The whole cast did pretty perfect job with The Two Towers. I know whole Trilogy made in same time. Only the film editors are changing through the trilogy. So they managed a great job making these movies.\n\nI think The Siege of Minas-Tirith sequence is also pretty good and flawless. But the horror and darkness is so effective in The Helm's Deep Battle. You may predict the Rohan People are going to win, they're the good guys after all. But even if you are watching this movie second time, you will feel that hopeless times again.\n\nThe first half of the movie feels slow, I think that brings realistic style to a fantasy movie. Of course there is too important scenes in the first half of the movie, I'm saying the most important scenes are in the second half of the movies. This goes for all three movies.\n\nTell me how can a movie achieve this much? Costume Design, Makeup, Art Direction & Set Decoration, Film Editing, VFX, SFX, Scores. The Trilogy manages to be revolutionary nearly all of that. At least it is Revolutionary in 5 of them. Some movies made me love some genres, The Lord of the Rings made me love the Cinema."

Any chapters cut out at the end of books III and IV will probably themselves in the next installment. If you haven't noticed, the beginning of the Two Towers was actually closed the Fellowship of the Ring on the big screen.\n\nGollum was a CG masterpiece. He added some light to this incredibly dark movie. At the same time, there are areas where you feel sorry for the poor guy, or just want to kill him. Smeagol was probably the most diverse character I've ever seen.\n\nElijah Wood put on a better performance than he did in the first movie, as did Sean Astin. Ian McKellen, who captivated us in the last movie, captivated us even more in this one. Viggo Mortensen, John Rhys-Davies, and Orlando Bloom made a great trio. They laughed together, cried together, prospered together, and suffered together. This trio gave life to Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas. Eowyn expressed her emotions clearly through Miranda Otto.\n\nThe music need not be discussed. Its greatness speaks for itself.\n\nFavorite Scene: The Battle of Helms Deep. Possibly the greatest scene in the book, 50% of the trailer, and action packed climax to this beautiful movie.\n\nThe movie, like its predecessor, fails to bring us closure, but that's ok.

After fleeing from an evil band of orcs, another pair of Hobbits sit with stalks, of an Ent known as Treebeard, who gets annoyed when friends are sheared, summons brethren, and against the foe they walk. Helm's Deep provides the backdrop for a battle, where sabres, swords and axes are all rattled, but walls come tumbling down, as the Uruk-hai hit town, when their hoards stampede and charge like crazy cattle."

        "review_detailed_main": "I do love all three films of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, all are visually stunning with wonderful music and strong narratives. The Two Towers is my personal favourite of the three for several reasons. For one thing it is less talky than Fellowship of the Ring, and the pace is a little more secure here. Also the final battle is just breathtaking in the action, direction and in its scope, and very compelling and epic. And some of the characters are developed more here than they were in Fellowship of the Ring primarily Frodo and Aragorn, who were played very well there but a little bland in comparison to here.\n\nWhen it comes to the scope The Two Towers is possibly the biggest in the trilogy. The cinematography is one of the strongest assets, while the scenery, costumes, lighting and make up(the orcs look amazing) are all gorgeous. You can tell a lot of effort went into this and it showed. The music is also darker and perhaps more complex, the story is richer and compelling and the dialogue is thought provoking. People may disagree, but I think The Two Towers is the best directed of the trilogy too.\n\nThe acting is very good. Elijah Wood is likable enough with a stronger-written character, while Sean Astin's bumbling persona suits Sam really well. Viggo Mortensson is as strong and charismatic as ever. Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee and Bernard Hill are also perfectly cast, but the real revelation in my view with this movie is Gollum. Here Gollum is designed superbly, and Andy Serkis's performance is absolutely phenomenal and Oscar-nod worthy.\n\nIn conclusion, a fine film and for me my personal favourite of the trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "I considered The Fellowship of the Ring to be one of the greatest movies ever. This one is better!\n\nThe scenery is marvelous, the animations great, and the story superb. This episode strays further from the books when it comes to the unfolding of events, but I feel that it stays closer in atmosphere and realism; the nazg\u00fbls are now the fear-inspiring creatures they should be. Gollum, excellently implemented, even becomes more realistic then I remember him from the books, not to mention other attempts to portray him. His schizophrenic monologues are among the highlights of the movie.\n\nThe major drawback is once again the apparent incapability of the dark-side creatures. Aragorn with fellows can ride back and forth among them unhurt, while the Uruk-Hai fall in large numbers just for being nearby. Though I enjoy many of the jokes made at Gimli's expense, this still is another thing I partly dislike. Gimli sure is no clown in the books.\n\nI rate the movie 9/10 (my highest so far)."

        "review_detailed_main": "Vote: 8.8 (rounded up to 9)\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is an amazing movie that any Tolkien fan, adventure fan, or war fan should see. Acting: Elijah Wood as Frodo is amazing. He really captures the pain that the poor little hobbit must be going through. Ian McKellen as Gandalf is excellent,even though he has a much smaller role than in FOTR. Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn was another good choice and you could really experience what he must be going through. John Rys-Davies was really good as Gimli, but his jokes got really tiring before the end. Sean Astin as Sam fit the description of good old Sam well and also acted out the character perfectly. Bernard Hill as Theoden, Brad Dourif as Grima, Miranda Otto as Eowyn, Karl Urban as Eomer, David Wenham as Faramir and Liv Tyler as Arwen were all excellent actors. Gollum was really amazing. Andy Serkis deserves some award, for the perfect cat coughing up fur ball voice for Gollum, and kudos to the design team who made the motion capture suit. I wish we could have seen more of Christopher Lee as he is a superb actor. Orlando Bloom as Legolas, on the other hand, sucked. He had absolutely no emotion and if it wasn't for his fighting scenes then the character would have been totally wasted. Dominic Monaghan as Merry and Billy Boyd as Pippin were also good actors. Directing: Peter Jackson did another excellent job in this movie, though as i said in my FOTR review, his career as a horror movie maker hurt him. The scene where all the dead Orc bodies were piled up and one of their heads was on a pole wasn't really necessary (and then Gimli was going through the burning remains (hmmmm orc barbecue), and there was another stupid scene were you saw the Uruks being born out of mud sacs. Screenplay: Good, the only scene they needed was the one in the extended edition of the flashback between Faramir, Boromir and Denethor. That scene was really necessary to describe Faramirs character Special Effects: Too amazing for words. The Battle of Helms Deep was so perfect you couldn't tell what was CGI and what wasn't. Gollum didn't look like a fake. The battle of Isengard was also well done and when the ents broke the dam and Isengard was flooded i was reminded of a disaster flick. The special effects alone were worth the price of admission. Other: Again the cinematography was beautiful and just jaw-dropping gorgeous. Makes me really want to visit New Zealand just to see the places they filmed. Rohan, and Edoras especially were beautiful. Howard Shore's score was excellent. The Rohan theme song fit the beautiful scenery perfectly. Overall: An excellent movie worth seeing. If the filmmakers weren't so stuck up about themselves this movie would be even better."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Two Towers is an enjoyable, and sometimes very good movie, but was a dissappointment to me in the wake of the sheer masterpiece that was The Fellowship Of The Ring.\n\nDirector Peter Jackson was able to fill the FOTR with a variety of well-developed characters, a sweeping cinematic landscape, a tense and intriguing storyline, and an overall depth that the book itself possessed. I am no expert on the books, but I do know that FOTR truly delivered the spirit of the book.\n\nNow having said that, one could just take all the battles and action, and hordes of armies and violent characters that exist in the books, plunk them into a bunch of fighting sequences, and make great action movies. The FOTR went beyond that, and captured the true heart of the original book, which is why it was so good, and will go down as a cinematic classic, much in the same way the books will go down as litterary classics.\n\nBeing Peter Jackson more or less filmed the trilogy of Lord Of The Rings films back-to-back, I figured that the sheer brilliance put forth in FOTR would be present. That is not the case.\n\nInstead, Jackson has delivered the aforementioned action movie. There's epic battle after epic battle, swordsman after swordsman, but little else. The centerpiece of the books and the first film -- the Hobbits -- are something of an afterthought in the TT, while swashbuckling swordsman Aragorn and bow and arrow marksmen Legolas take the spotlight. These are characters who are embody the standard action movie hero in every sense, but again, don't begin to scrape the depths of the book, which is so much more than what is on display here.\n\nThere's word that Jackson did a lot of re-shooting and editing to the TT in the last 12 months. Perhaps he felt the pressure to follow up to the mammoth success of FOTR, and decided to take the safe way out. But what he may have failed to realise is that what made FOTR so great and popular was it's depth beyond your standard action flick. In the wake of the downward spiral of the Star Wars films, which suffer from the same condition plauging the TT, movie fans were looking to latch on to a new fantasy epic, that could provide the great effects and all of that good stuff, but also deliver the goods in terms of story, charachter, and overall depth.\n\nComplaints aside, this is still a fun movie. For starters, you know that you enjoyed a movie when it clocks in at 3 hours long, and you don't find yourself getting restless, whcih I did not. Additionally, The CGI is ultra-impressive, there are lots of incredible visuals (though not on par with the first film), and the action sequences are truly amazing. I just came out dissappointed because one year ago, I went into the theatre to see FOTR not knowing what to expect, and I was given a completley unexpected masterpiece. This time, I went into the TT expect to see another classic, and instead I was delivered a big-budget action flick. Fun movie? Yes. Great special effects? Yes. Another classic? No.\n\nOn a closing note, I think Roger Ebert's review of this movie hits the nail right on the head, and he is able to articulate many of the thoughts I have on this film very successfully."

Therefore he has re-written the story from the book in an attempt to make it \"bigger and better\". In the original text there where no fun side-kicks with good one-liners and there where not enough cool toys so Peter had to throw in some Orc wolf riders and dwarf jokes. Then he find Frodos meeting with Faramir to be a bit too boring in the book, so he \"spice it up\" with a \"dramatic\" scene where Frodo stands in front of a ring wraith trying to give it the ring. Yeah baby! There are also plenty of not good enough acting from the extras. Extremely theatrical lines like \"Look it's the king!\" are a bit too common. If you thought the books where boring then maybe this is a film for you. Now there are plenty of \"fun\" side-kicks in it to save you from embarrassing seconds of silence or non-action. If you actually liked the books, stay away from this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've read ---with care and delight--- the books four times in the last 34 years, including the recent reversion to Tolkein's \"original\" manuscript, edited by his son. I'm a fan. There, I said it, and I'm glad, I tell you!\n\nThis second installment of the trilogy is probably as good as a movie could get. It captures the Tolkein vibe probably as well as it could be captured in a theatrical release. Watching the flick tonight I realized that much of the vaunted charm of the very readable and very \"literary\" Tolkein books is in part the time it takes to read the long pages--- 1,000 to 1,400 pages, depending on the edition your are holding. And that time--- weeks and weeks of pouring over pages, re-reading certain passages, pondering and mulling over the fake languages and songs, and histories Tolkein concocted--- allows one to create and invent the Tolkein world inside oneself. That's GREAT! I loved each time I read the original. But no one could possibly expect a movie to give you, in 2-1/2 hours, that kind of luxurious lingering in the fantasy world. Duh!\n\nTherefore, the movie's focus on action--- and FYI, it is dead-on accurate and faithful to the books--- is OK. The Ents' meeting in the forest took 3 or 4 DAYS in the book, and Merry and Pippin spent many more days hanging with Treebeard. The movie telescoped that down into a few hours. But hey!!! Think about it--- how could a movie, ANY movie, capture all of the sylvan reverie (including the Hobbits growing a couple of feet taller with the Entwash, etc.) in a trilogy movie series? All of that dreamy book-world stuff would be great to see on the screen--- but it would take dozens and dozens of hours of screen-time. Who could sit in a theater for that many weeks? There aren't that many \"festive\" people on the planet to make such a theatrical release profitable.\n\nMaybe if we were wishing, we could have wished for a 30 or 40 hour TV mini-series. Then we COULD afford to meander and linger and all of that. Seriously--- I'd have enjoyed it. But then, the battles and evil empire and such would have to be portrayed with a vigor equal to Jackson's efforts, else the drama and peril (etc.) would be lost. For MY ridiculous wishing, then, I'm wishing for them to have made two projects--- the 3 theater-release movies, AND a 30-hour TV mini-series for all the \"literary\" vibe. But then, instead of a $300 million triology, we'd have had a $1 BILLION dollar (but memorable!) TV mini-series. Oh well--- if wishing were having...\n\nOverall, \"LOTR Two Towers\" is an excellent movie! A \"10\" out of \"10\"!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The second part of The Lord of the Rings saga maintains the style, momentum and integrity that made the first film as brilliant as it is and thus what Peter Jackson gives us is one of the best sequels ever and certainly the best film of 2002. I prefer the first film for being closer to the book but I completely understand the changes made from book to film and I see why they are necessary to keep the film's narrative flowing instead of dropping dead. The film is not without a few weaknesses mainly because of it being a middle part linking The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King and therefore not having an obvious beginning or an end. This doesn't stop the film from being an experience that people shouldn't be cheated out of.\n\nThe acting is, like in the first film, very good and at times even brilliant. Viggo Mortensen improves greatly and provides a more well rounded and believable Aragorn and proves his qualities as an actor especially in the quit moments (of which there are too few in the theatrical release, this was remedied in the extended cut). Also Elijah Wood deepens his character considerably and shows many of the darker sides of his character in the film. This provides for some interesting exchanges between Wood and his faithful companion played by Sean Astin. Bernard Hill is introduced in this film along with the method actor, Brad Dourif. Both of the aforementioned are excellent in their respective parts even though there are some inconsistencies in Hill's character compared to the character from the book. These changes were obviously made for dramatic purposes and are very plausible. Ian McKellen's character, Gandalf, has been somewhat reduced in the second film but instead he steals every scene he is in. Likewise, Hugo Weaving's character has been reduced but he is still very good and keeps his character in the same style as in the first film. Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies returns as well and I have to comment on the choice to make Gimli into comic relief, because while I understand the necessity given that Dominic Monaghan's and Billy Boyd's characters have taken a turn towards more serious characters there had to be someone to relieve the dramatic tension, I found it a shame that Gimli had been reduced to some bumbling clown. Fortunately most of his comic remarks worked. Among other characters introduced are Faramir, played by David Wenham, and Gollum, played beautifully by Andy Serkis. I'll get back to Faramir but for now I have to comment on Gollum. Gollum is quite simply the most interesting film character in the last decade and this relates both to the ground breaking special effects but also Serkis' performance, which was most unfairly not deemed fit for an Oscar nomination. Overall the acting is excellent like in the first film and all actors manages to develop their characters in ways that are at the very least acceptable.\n\nThe effects and fight scenes in this second film are among the best ever and is perhaps only bested by some of the effects in the third film in the series. The Gollum character and the battle for Helm's Deep seem to be excellent examples. Gollum is quite simply the most stunning and beautifully created CGI character of all time and he displays extraordinary emotional range. As previously stated The Battle for Helm's Deep is among the finest battle scenes ever created. Well paced and choreographed and above all the editing in between the hectic battle sequences and scared citizens provides for some emotional depth as well (something that was sorely needed in the battle sequences in Star Wars: Episode II). This gigantic battle isn't the only battle in the film. There are many other interesting battles but I'm not going to spoil them so you'll just have to see the film yourself. The battles are consistent with the style that was laid down in the first film they are simply on a much more epic scale.\n\nSome people have raved that the changes made from book to film were too radical but I completely understand and condone the reasons which were obviously dramatic purposes. Especially David Wenham's character has been criticized and after watching it the first time I was a bit unhappy with his character as well but when you think about it the changes in the character were at the very least essential to maintain the narrative structure. There are other examples but it would really be pointless to mention them because the reason is exactly the same as in the case of David Wenham's character. Dramatic purposes.\n\nOverall The Two Towers serves as an excellent link between the Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King and it deserves every bit of praise coming to it. One of the very best films of all time.\n\n10/10 - On my top 10 of best films"

Not only is it the middle child, but the very structure of the book makes it hard to craft a linear story with all the plot lines in tact and interesting.\n\nBut I think Peter Jackson and company did a very good job. It's not as strong as Fellowship, but is still outstanding.\n\nAll the elements of the LOTR films are here: the beautiful photography, set designs, costumes, scenery, special effects. All amazing, all brilliant, all Oscar-worthy.\n\nThe performances are terrific, too. Bernard Hill, Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Miranda Otto, all did great jobs. The supporting actors, too.\n\nIt is sad that Ian McKellan's role is relegated to almost cameo status, but that's the nature of the book. The biggest shame is Christopher Lee. He has so little screen time in this film, I think he only says two or three lines on camera, the rest is \"brooding\". Such a waste, he is one of the great actors of our time, a real joy to watch (and a scene stealer to boot).\n\nBut the stars of the piece have to be Gollum and Treebeard and the Uruk army. The sequence with the Ents seeing the destruction Saruman wrought upon the trees brought tears to my eyes, and their revenge brought cheers to my voice. The battle of Helm's Deep was probably too long, but impressive nonetheless (and will probably be the model for \"epic battle sequences\" for years to come). And Gollum. What can be said about Gollum that hasn't already been said. We have entered into a new age of CGI, and, like all great works of art, it has a human soul.\n\nA great film. 9 out of 10, the only items keeping it from getting a 10 are the short-shrifting of Christopher Lee and that some parts don't quite flow too well (a problem rooted in JRR Tolkien's novel, not the fault of the filmmakers)."

Return of the King may have won more of the Oscars as the culmination of Peter Jackson's magnificent cinematic achievement, but history will in fact adjudge \"The Two Towers\" as the greatest of the three Rings. If Fellowship was a road movie and ROTK was a friendship film, then Two Towers is an unadulterated war movie of heroic proportions. Peter Jackson said he based it on \"Zulu\"- and we can see why. It has a dramatic intensity and flow which none of the other films quite share. Good against evil are so sharply contrasted that you could cut your fingers on them. TTT also has the best score Howard Shore has produced. And it has the best dialogue.\n\nThe screenplay explains (with barely disguised contemporary resonance) what we are protecting in Western civilisation when we defend ourselves against those who would wish to destroy it. When Sam tells Frodo that there are \"some things worth fighting for\", when Merry tells Pippin that there \"won't be a Shire\" unless they do something about it, when King Theoden laments that \"the sun has gone down in the West\" this film could be entitled not the \"Two Towers\" but \"the Twin Towers\". It is Miltonic in its scope. It is cinema as art.\n\nYes, one may quibble about certain Entish details, and I know that the Elves weren't supposed to be at Helm's Deem, and that Faramir is a little undeveloped, but does this matter? Not at all. The Extended version is better than the original, but does not need to make such a quantum leap as Fellowship managed with its EE. However it will be a film that is seen as a landmark in cinema. A trilogy which may never be bettered. And a reminder of what we are all here for"

        "review_detailed_main": "First off, The Two Towers is an amazing achievement. As with the Fellowship of the Ring, the Two Towers is one of the best films ever. However, the only problem I find with this film is that it is too short. Yea, you heard me right! The new characters needed to be fleshed out a little more. The Fellowship of the Ring IMO is superior because of the interaction between the core players. We were there when they made their journey, we were not hopping back and forth between their individual adventures. Yes I know that is the way the book is written, but I just prefer the Fellowship's more intimate look at the characters. This withstanding the Two Towers is an amazing achievement. WETA Digital truly deserves all of the kudos that have been bestowed upon them. They have supplanted Industrial Light and Magic as the preeminent digital effects company.\n\nBottom Line:\n\n10/10!!!"

While not a perfect film, as a movie with no concrete beginning or ending, it tells a masterful story and keeps the audience wanting more.\n\nSome characters are severally underdeveloped (mostly new ones) and it's a bit slow at times. But besides these more major complaints, the film is a masterpiece. As with the last film, the acting is great, the effects are groundbreaking (Gollum changed CGI), and the action scenes are well choreographed and exciting. The dialogue works really well to. The movie is simply filled with iconic moments.\n\nSome complain about the battle of Helms Deep being to long but let's be honest, it is really one of the best battle scenes in cinematic history. I believe that the Lord of the Rings trilogy are the greatest films of this century. The Two Towers is a grand adventure, epic war movie, compelling drama and overall, an amazing movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Peter Jackson himself has admitted The Two Towers was the hardest part of the trilogy to achieve, at least in terms of narrative structure since, unlike The Fellowship of the Ring, it has no proper beginning and no emotionally packed climax (Boromir's death in Fellowship was one of that film's most moving moments). It picks up exactly from where its predecessor ended: the Fellowship is split in three separate groups, all with their own problems to take care of:\n\nFrodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their journey to Mordor in order to destroy the One Ring, and find an unexpected guide in that item's previous owner, vicious creature Gollum (Andy Serkis); Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) reunite with the reborn Gandalf (Ian Mckellen) to save the dying kingdom of Rohan from Saruman's (Christopher Lee) evil clutch; Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) have a close encounter with the Ents, ancient creatures which have unfinished business with a certain bad wizard...\n\nThis second opus is less talking and more fighting: key characters are reduced to cameos (most notably Galadriel) and new people are quickly introduced so that we can be dragged into some huge battles, culminating in the 40-minute long combat at Helm's Deep, quite simply the movie's highlight. If, however, you want more insight on the characters and their motivations, get the extended cut, whose additional sequences are essential to understand pivotal moments of the third film.\n\nHelm's Deep aside, the movie's most remarkable element is the mad, schizophrenic Gollum. He's got \"ambiguity\" and \"unreliability\" written all over him, as we see him struggle with his two personas, one the good fella he once was, the other a filthy, treacherous freak who wants nothing more than his \"preccciousssss\" back (the conversation between the two personalities is one of the most beautiful scenes ever made). He makes us suspicious about his most insignificant gesture, and has us thinking the worst may happen in The Return of the King.\n\nNot as good as the previous part (at least the theatrical version, which I rate 9/10), but still a really good fantasy movie, and one of the best pictures of 2002."

I could excuse the first one for a little low-brow humour considering it didn't get right into the journey at first, but it was too overdone to at least lighten the mood in a serious context. It also had massive pacing issues, as it either brought everything to a standstill or hurried everything on, and it's suddenly strange how they stray off and bring to your attention scenes of no point whatsoever.\n\nOn the positive side, the acting wasn't affected too much. The scenes with either Legolas, Aragorn or Frodo were beautifully done, so I have come to terms with the fact that the acting can still be good even when the pacing isn't. Despite that, they should have taken a few of the characters out, because they were kind of pointless. I liked Gollum (or Sm\u00e9agol), but I think he was just there for the crazy factor.\n\nOverall, it was good, but was not as good as the first one. This could definitely have been better. Maybe they should just have done two films if there was going to be such a big gap in the middle."

From the moment a hint of her liking him came out, I could see what was going to happen.\n\nThe only interesting character was Golum. He symbolized the external battle for good and evil through an internal struggle.\n\nThe dialogue in this movie offered nothing. It was mostly about one group's plans, followed by the enemies plans.\n\nWell. I don't want to think much more about this movie. I think it was terrible. The fighting scenes and animation were cool. Perhaps the \"acting\" parts should be cut and the remaining scenes should be edited as cut scenes into a video game or something, because this definately doesn't stand as a film on its own."

Like the Helm's Deep battle which made the 100 best battles of all-time. There wasn't much of a story but who cares, it's Lord of the Rings!!! I loved the sword-fighting and the orcs too. This movie gave me chills down my back from the fighting and the unforgettable lines. Gollum was so cool and funny. Andy Serkis did so well in doing Gollum's voice and the CGI was amazing! The landscape once again was superb. This is another one of my favorite movies. It's not better than the fellowship and Return of the King but was very close and is still a smoking brilliant film. Go LORD OF THE RINGS, BABY!!!!!!!!!\n\n10/10!!! Highly Recommend!!! You better go see this movie!!"

Jackson captures the essence and the excitement of the film with unbelievable integrity.\n\nThe Lord of The Rings is a story of good and evil, of dark forces battling the light, of heaven and hell. J.R.R. Tolkien had a profound Christian vision. Every character is a prototype.\n\nFrodo is the hero on a great quest. Samwise Gangee represents everyman, essentially good and an unsung hero. Gandalf, a Christlike figure, dying and returning again to serve Middle Earth. Gollum is a tormented soul, evil, but an object of pity just the same. Aragorn, Gimli the Dwarf, and Legolas the Woodland elf, all have their place in this tale. The Orcs are the human/elf form corrupted beyond recognition.\n\nThe battle scenes in The Two Towers are exciting and some of the best every filmed. Computer animation works wonderfully with the Ents and Gollum.\n\nI am thrilled that Two Towers had been so popular and has made money.\n\nBring on The Return of The King."

An excellent film, but it is my least favourite in the trilogy.\n\nSam and Frodo continue their journey towards Mordor to rid Middle Earth of the One Ring, while Aragon, Gimli and Legolas prepare to do battle with the armies of the dark. Also, we get to see Gollum for the first time in this film, in all of his CG glory! Pure screen magic. Amazing special effects, a great storyline continuing the tale, this is a film that should definitely not be missed! The end battle is pure CG magic! Peter Jackson has done it once again! I recommend the extended edition, which shows us more in this wonderful tale.\n\nI say that this is my least favourite in the trilogy for the simple reason that it jumps from Sam and Frodo, to Aragon and Legolas, to Merry and Pippen, and back and forth. It can get somewhat confusing and hard to follow if you have not read the books.\n\nDespite this one minor flaw, the film is eye-poppingly beautiful, from the beautiful scenes, to the amazing special effects. Definitely not a film to be missed!"

But I was reminded of watching the Baski animated version - this section of the saga suffers from cutting between gripping stuff and tedious stuff, especially Merry and Pippin on bloody boring Treebeard. Loved the addition of the warg attack but it did have the effect of making Middle Earth seem tiny and, if Saruman's forces could reach Rohan so quickly then why didn't he head straight for Helm's Deep and stop them getting in? Eh?\n\nAlso, the battle left me cold. Compared to Boromir's last stand, all these computer-generated t**ts running about were just unconvincing. And why is Gimli nothing but clumsy comic relief? All that 'toss me' stuff - terrible.\n\nBut, by far the worst crime here is Legolas skateboarding down the steps. I expected Huey Lewis and the News to kick in.\n\nThat aside, I will watch the DVD over and over but I'm hoping the extended version, as with Fellowship of the Ring, will iron out the pacing problems and give us more character study to balance the action."

        "review_detailed_main": "In The Fellowship of the Ring, the film saga of the Lord of the Rings was kicked-off in an endearing and faithful way. It meticulously established the groundwork for a cast of iconic heroes, settings with palpable folklore, and a grand journey that would stagger the imagination. The adventure continues in The Two Towers, with all the same flair and attention to detail that was established before. Only now, it's a return to familiar territory, and the film uses every opportunity to expand the narrative and present an even stronger fantasy experience.\n\nPicking up where the first film let off, The Two Towers wastes no time in tracking each character's tangent and showing what happens next. The film's opening, showing Gandalf confronting the monstrous Balrog, is an awe-inspiring sight as it is. Then we continue to follow Frodo and Sam on their quest to Mordor, and it is touch-and-go for them as they evade enemy forces and consort with the villainous Gollum. At the same time, the film tracks Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli as they trek into Rohan, to inevitably confront the threat of orc invasion head-on. All these plot threads build up to a magnificent climax, including the Battle of Helm's Deep (a lengthy and awesome siege), the marching of the Ents (an imaginative and inspiring sequence), and the skirmishes of Osgiliath (providing the emotional climax to accentuate the action). It is a consistently engaging film with plenty of awesome spectacle.\n\nThe story branches off into multiple directions with quite a lot of characters. You'd think it would be hard to keep track of everything (a complaint that made Cloud Atlas so inaccessible to audiences), but this film somehow manages to juggle everything perfectly, giving each tangent just enough time so that it never fades far from memory. It's easy to keep track of the characters and their movements across Middle-Earth, even with the addition of new characters, taut political drama, and even more folklore thrown in. The characters remain as endearing as ever, and the plot is manipulated with expert precision. Tolkein purists may be quick to point out the changes from the source material, which become more numerous in this film than in its predecessor, but the basics of the story remain intact. Most changes are made to accommodate the story's events across the three films in the most presentable way. While the film continues to utilize the classic epic-journey plot structure, it digs up some relevant themes concerning war, industrialization, and courage throughout.\n\nAs before, the film is crafted expertly, with excellent photography and editing. Acting continues to impress from the whole cast; Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Sean Austin, Dominic Monaghan, Billy Boyd, Orlando Bloom, John Rhyes-Davies, Hugo Weaving, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, and Cate Blanchett all continue to inhabit their characters aptly. Andy Serkis steals the spotlight, while Karl Urban, David Wenham, Brad Dourif, Bernard Hill, and Miranda Otto offer welcome additions to the cast. The writing is great. Locales are beautiful. This production continues to use top-notch sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Howard Shore's music score is still impressively magnificent.\n\nThe Two Towers is a thrilling continuation of the events laid forth in The Fellowship of the Ring, and it builds up to one impressive climax. It's still a great story told with great style, and with good attention to depth and detail. As strong of an experience as it is, it's still only building up to an even grander experience...\n\nThe Extended Cut of this film includes about 45 minutes of new scenes. Some of it includes extended action and battle scenes, which are cool. There's also a great flashback scene involving Faramir and Boromir. There are also a bunch of really neat smaller scenes, many of which adapt specific scenes from the book, or offer more to the characters. It is a really cool cut of the movie that's well worth seeing.\n\n5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect <> Story: Perfect <> Film: Perfect)"

But the two Towers is not a failure but it does not match up to the quality of the Fellowship of the Ring.The Two Towers continues the adventures of the fellowship as they separate and take their own routes; Frodo makes his way to Mordor with Sam, and his guide Gollum, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli head to find Merry and Pippin and to defend Helms Deep from Isengard. The film struggles to make an impact, although the film is good enough to keep your interest high for the concluding part in the trilogy, the Return of the King."

        "review_detailed_main": "Reading the comments of my fellow viewers I remark that having seen the film in the first days after the release I shared the experience with the hard core fans of the series. Not being one of them (until now at least), I can just comment of the quality of the film making. In my opinion, it is an extremely well directed film, superb camera work, and greater effects I have ever seen. If anybody doubts that computer effects became an art of its own, her/his doubts will be dissipated by this film. The complexity and perfection of some scenes looks like a big work of art, and the comparison coming to my mind is to Brueghel's or Bosch's paintings.\n\nHowever, the story is very complex. The director decided that the whole film will be just one piece of art, broken into three slices of three hours each only by commercial reasons. This median series starts and ends in the midst of the story telling. Well, having been busy the last year with a few other things - among them seeing many other movies - and not having read the book, I had problems in getting much of the action and characters development. A short recollection of the previous series action would have helped, and I recommend it to distributors for the next time. They can of course, take it out for the big nine-ten hours screening in cinematheques of the future times :-)\n\nPeople who read the book were mixed in their reactions. Some say that the book is richer in characters and philosophy, and the movie loses something. Well, this happens with most books adaptations. I think that in this case, there is a lot the screen adaptation has added as well. But I will certainly buy and read the book now!\n\nIt is still a good movie, one of the best of the year. I said good, but not great - only 8/10 on my personal scale, which I think will end being close to the real and deserved average mark of this film, after the initial fans enthusiasm cools out."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Two Towers is the second book in Tolkien's masterpiece trilogy of invented English mythology and the second film in Peter Jackson's film trilogy based on the original mid-20th century novels.\n\nThe Fellowship has physically disbanded, though through its bonds of purpose and friendship, remains intimately connected. Two Towers follows the members of the fellowship through their continuing, and increasingly dark and dangerous, adventures as they each do their part (whether accidental or intentionally) to try to save all that is good in Middle Earth from the power-hungry eye of Sauron, Lord of Mordor. Frodo (Wood) and Samwise (Aston) are lead by their captive Smeagol/Golem (Serkus) to Mordor, but Golem's intentions are, at best, suspicious.\n\nThe ring has begun to taint Frodo's mind and soul, and rage and hate make fleeting and uncharacteristic appearances in this previously innocent and light-hearted Hobbit. He has already begun to recognize that he and Golem have more in common than anybody would care to admit. His profound friendship with Sam is very nicely portrayed in this film and is as central in the film as it is in Tolkien's original work. Smeagol/Golem is also treated sympathetically and his ambiguity and the polarity of his personalities are key to his role as an unpredictable element.\n\nThe story also introduces three major human characters- Theodin (Hill), Eowyn (Otto), and Farromir - all of whom will play important parts in the Fellowship's mission as the story progresses. Two important, but less often present characters are also introduced \u0096 Grima Wormtongue (Dourif) and Eomer (Urban). As I discussed in my review of the Fellowship, the casting and acting are perfect, and the new additions are no exception.\n\nAndy Serkus' and the animation team's Golem becomes a major character in The Two Towers. Serkus' contributions to the character are profound, and very nicely reflected in the special features for the Two Towers. I look forward to seeing more work from this performer and I sincerely hope that he does not go over-looked or remain type-cast.\n\nIn the first film, during a valiant and successful attempt to prevent harm from coming to Frodo, Merry and Pippin (Monaghan and Boyd) are carried off by Saruman's army, narrowly escaping into Fangorn forest when the Uruk'Hai party is slain by an exiled band of Rohirim lead by Eomer. The hobbits manage to wind up in the hands of an Ent \u0096 a wise old walking tree and steward of the forest, who they try to convince to join in the fight against Saruman and Sauron.\n\nAragorn, Gimli and Legolas continue their dogged attempt to rescue Merry and Pippin, and an old friend unexpectedly re-enters the story as several components of the Fellowship come together to devise an improbable defense of the land of Rohan against the overwhelming force of Mordor.\n\nLike The Fellowship, the Two Towers manages to capture the essence of Tolkien's story and characters while rearranging portions for better cinematic continuity and emphasizing interpretive connections which are not wholly obvious in Tolkien's writing. Two elements keep Frodo from the brink of abject insanity \u0096 Sam and Smeagol. Smeagol's addiction to the ring allows Frodo to sympathize with him in a way that only an addict can understand. Sam's pure and clear-headed love for Frodo offers a sane and reliable anchor. Other members of the Fellowship help each other in similar ways as Gimli, Aragorn and Legolas prepare for battle and Gandalf works hard to repair the damaged bonds between Rohan and Gondor.\n\nThe darkest and most uncomfortable of the three movies, The Two Towers is also, in some ways, the most powerful. The themes are morality, sacrifice, friendship and, as always, the nature and just use of power. Many have commented on Tolkien's religious beliefs and their permeation throughout the LOTR, but it is worth noting that the great scholar uses components of many different cultures and belief systems to create the world he portrays, and \u0096 from a strict Roman Catholic perspective (Tolkien's religion of choice) - there are many more blasphemies in LOTR than there are catholic metaphors and symbols. In the Two Towers, the internal power struggle between good and evil gains momentum within the fellowship's principal protagonists. As with the fellowship, the art direction, score and soundscaping subtly add great depth to the entire experience.\n\nThe story and its themes are in no way subordinated to the technical merit of the film, but its methods are still very noteworthy. Golem is not an animated insertion who intrudes in every scene, but rather, a fully developed central character around whom Frodo and Sam's story arc revolves. The sets and landscapes, just like the Fellowship before it, are immersive and in every way as sensually real as if they had been built thousands of years ago and weathered by exposure to the elements of Middle Earth. The battle scenes are exciting, dramatic and believable. And the special features on the Special Edition box set explain how all of this was accomplished with lucidity."

If you haven't read the books (heck, even if you have...) and believe that the Lord of the Rings is your typical superficial, without a shred of subtelty Good vs. Evil story and that the upshot is that some short people need to throw a ring in a volcano, and that entertains you, then you may enjoy this film.\n\nIf your looking for something more transcendent you will be disappointed. The screenwriters, which ones I don't know, have done a poor job of translating Tolkien to the screen (and no, capturing Tolkien's spirit is difficult but not impossible in a movie so don't throw out that straw man), and contrary to what Peter Jackson stated on the special edition DVD of FoTR, they have not stayed as close to the original story as possible and HAVE thrown their own spin in. Why aren't they more up-front about this?\n\nOh well."

Once again the costumes, scenes, sets, models, effects and epic score of Howard Shore work together to create a great atmosphere.\n\nThe core cast from the first film is back and once again proves adept. Several new characters appear in this film and are once again well-cast. Bernard Hill is authoritative and inspiring as King Theoden of Rohan. Miranda Otto is notable as Eowyn, though her best moments would come in the third film. Brad Dourif was a perfect choice for the conniving Grima Wormtongue. David Wenham and Karl Urban are effective as the warriors Faramir and Eomer. John Rhys-Davies, in addition to playing Gimli, is memorable for providing the voice for Treebeard.\n\nLike with the first film, this film streamlines Tolkien's work but largely remains faithful to it to create a well-paced film. The conflict at Helm's Deep is spectacular and the second best fantasy battle ever filmed next to the battle in \"Return of the King\" (2003). My only complaint with this film is the alterations to Faramir's character. The \"Two Towers\" book made a clear distinction between Faramir and Boromir's personalities, but in this film they are homogenized. However, this is a minor blemish in what is otherwise an outstanding film. As with the last film, I found that the added scenes for the extended edition were interesting but didn't add much above and beyond the theatre cut."

        "review_detailed_main": "Of the three pictures in Peter Jackson's epic treatment of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, this one probably takes the most liberties in adapting JRR Tolkein's book. Middle sections in a trilogy are often problematic, especially in the movies. Tolkein would have expected his readers to work through the books chapter-by-chapter, the split into the three volumes being mainly to keep the actual tomes to a practical size. A movie however is more of a stand-alone thing, and it needs a satisfying beginning and ending even when it's the middle of a larger story.\n\nJackson, along with his co-writers Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Stephen Sinclair have done a neat job. The Two Towers has an added problem in that the characters get split into three groups, and three separate narrative lines. The novel devotes half a book each to the different sets of characters. The script for The Two Towers must find more fluid ways of integrating the different story lines, and there is some canny balancing of pure action and 'human' themes. They insert a little episode of the romance between Aragorn and Arwen, which is a bit dull in itself but provides a brief moment of tranquillity to build up tension before the next burst of action. There's also an implication that Eowyn slightly fancies Aragorn, which as far as I recall was not in the book, but it actually works far better than the official romance because it is tied into the sense of danger at the battle. Finally, the writers leave off some of the book's material for the third movie, to put more focus on the Helm's Deep climax and wind towards satisfactory conclusions for each of the story's strands.\n\nPeter Jackson is very much a craftsman of his generation, with all the pros and cons of modern filmmaking. As with The Fellowship of the Ring, the movie is over-edited, with shots never lasting more than a couple of seconds. But this is Jackson's style and he knows how to do great things with it. He's especially good at switching between the inside and the outside of a situation. When Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas encounter the Rohirrim, the riders surge into view over the hillside, and Jackson really gives us a feel of the power of this army with breathtaking shots from above and then ones inside the throng with horses towering over the camera. Later he creates a mighty \"wow\" moment when the black rider appears, a gauntleted hand at first, before pulling back to reveal the massive winged steed. And the detail in Jackson's close-ups is if anything more meaningful than his massive CGI crowd shots. When we see Frodo's hand moving for the ring round his neck, his fingers are rough and dirty, just as they would on someone who has spent weeks travelling in the wilderness.\n\nThe breaking of the fellowship into smaller groups in The Two Towers allows individual characters to come out a bit more, and it's the better movie for it. As before though there are a few problems with the acting. Elijah Wood makes a dismal and unsympathetic Frodo, moaning his way across Middle Earth with a perpetually forlorn look. Andy Serkis's Gollum is certainly a spirited little fellow, but I feel he's just a little too pathetic, and not convincingly cunning enough \u2013 or perhaps that problem lies more in the way he's been animated. Once again it is Ian McKellen who brings most dignity to the proceedings, but this time he is aided by solid turns from the likes of Bernard Hill and Miranda Otto. Alongside the development of characters, most of the players from the previous movie perform a little better this time around, and John Rhys Davis is particularly good as a loveably comical Gimli.\n\nPerhaps what really makes The Two Towers is Jackson's deliberate tendency to be somewhat silly. Who else would come up with a Tolkein adaptation featuring an Olympic torch-bearer orc or Legolas surfing down the steps on a shield, unless it was a deliberate parody (which it never for one moment feels like)? Above all, he seems to be having fun with what he's doing. I don't think the oliphaunts were supposed to be quite that big in the books, but Jackson clearly wanted the Imperial Walkers from The Empire Strikes Back in his movie. It's his ability to adapt the material with dignity but without taking it too seriously, that means generally the audience is having as much fun as he is."

It may just be that Tolkien's books are too much to try to put into a movie. I will say that this was probably the best effort that could be made by a human. But no movie can truly capture the feeling and human quality of the books.\n\nThe battle sequences were not emotionally engaging. And the orcs are too \"over-the-top\" scary for my taste. I did like the sequences between Frodo, Sam and Gollum. The portrayal of the ring's effect on Frodo was well done.\n\nAll-in-all, this is a downer of a movie. It's the book in the trilogy that is the darkest. Hopefully, the third movie will be a good uplifting ending to this set of three."

From its breathtaking landscapes to its profound character arcs, this film is an immersive experience that cements its place in cinematic history.\n\nPeter Jackson's masterful direction takes us deeper into J. R. Tolkien's rich world, exploring themes of hope, betrayal, and resilience. The unparalleled visual effects transport viewers to the depths of Helm's Deep and the lushness of Fangorn Forest, creating a visual feast that amplifies the emotional stakes of the story. The battle sequences are nothing short of monumental; they're not just displays of brute strength but a testament to camaraderie and the sacrifice of countless souls-blurring the lines between victory and loss.\n\nAt the heart of The Two Towers lies the evolution of its characters, especially Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Frodo. Viggo Mortensen embodies Aragorn's internal struggle with destiny and leadership with nuance, while Orlando Bloom breathes life into Legolas, his agility and wisdom perfectly complementing Gimli's boisterous bravery, played by John Rhys-Davies. And then there's Gollum-a hauntingly complex figure brought to life with groundbreaking CGI and Andy Serkis's brilliant performance. His duality captivates and evokes sympathy, representing the darker sides of desire and obsession.\n\nThe film intricately weaves the threads of hope amid despair. As our heroes face insurmountable odds, The Two Towers reminds us that the bonds of friendship and courage shine brightest in the darkest of times. The emotional depth is heightened by Howard Shore's sweeping score, which resonates long after the credits roll, evoking a lingering sense of wonder and reflection.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is an extraordinary cinematic journey that transcends the conventional sequel. It captures the essence of Tolkien's work-an enduring struggle against the shadows that linger in our hearts. Masterful, monumental, and truly unique, this film is not just a chapter in a saga; it is a revelation of the indomitable spirit of Middle-earth."

A New Power Is Rising !. The Battle for Middle-earth Begins!.All will be sacrificed... All will be lost... Unless all unite against evil. The fellowship is broken. The power of darkness grows...The Journey Continues !.\n\nThis top-drawer epic adventure with plenty of action , impressive battles , spectacular drama , twists , gorgeous exteriors from New Zealand and being pretty entertaining , in spite of about three hours runtime , while still managing to keep a quick enough pace for those unfamilar with the lengthy literary work . The great cast is really terrific , though Gollum is a CGI role, but Peter Jackson wished the character to be performer-oriented, so Andy Serkis, the voice of Gollum, played the character in a motion capture suit . The movie packs a real sense of wonder and stimulating action set pieces illuminating the full-blown feats of the various protagonists and winding up in overlong battles and a stunning finale . The famous and overwhelming battle at Helm's Deep was edited down from twenty hours of footage and filmed over a four month period . It contains incredible array of technical visual effects by Weta Digital and Weta Workship , among other companies . Marvellous and colorful cinematography by cameraman Andrew Lesnie and long-standing as well as sensitive musical score by Howard Shore , winning deservedly Academy Award . Beautifully realized set design with phenomenal production values and lavishly produced by Harvey and Bob Weinstein . The film provides amusement enough during the appoximately three hours and stays closer to the novel than any of the former adaptations -mostly animated and in low budget- such as the mediocre effort directed by Ralph Baski . The motion picture will appeal to Tolkien followers as the neophyte who didn't have seen the other parts . Stunning shooting by Sir Peter Jackson bringing competently the fantastic world and mythology of the great British author to life . This stunning and top-notch trilogy is made up of : \u00a8The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power\u00a8 (2002), \u00a8The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\u00a8 (2002) and \u00a8The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\u00a8 (2003) , all of them magnificently directed by Peter Jackson ."

The story progresses nicely in this the second chapter which is in my opinion the most difficult of the three to execute. Once again director Jackson impressively conveyed the scope and grandeur of Middle Earth mostly through state of the art computer animation and special effects. Speaking of that, Gollum the CGI character, while a technical marvel, became extremely annoying. That's just my individual opinion. By the way, I think Jar Jar Binks is brilliant comic relief in The Phantom Menace (I'm not prejudiced against CGI characters!) The acting from the cast was also spot on though frankly I don't think the material was that challenging (ie. no one deserved an Oscar nomination). The costumes, props, and beautiful location photography were also uniformly excellent as befits a production of this magnitude. 8/10. I should note that I haven't seen the original theatrical cut of the film so I don't know what else besides background on the Boromir (?) character was added. I look forward to the conclusion of the trilogy!"

A wide shot of people walking. A close up of people walking. and not much else happening. I'm trying to figure out why everyone in these books has two names. (As if the plot isn't complicated enough for those of us who haven't read the book.) The only redeeming thing in the whole movie is that goblin thing that calls the ring 'precious'. (even he has two names) Hence I gave it a two, instead of a one. Sure the special effects were great. But great special effects does not mean the movie is great. I liked the first LOTR movie, quite a bit more than I expected, actually. I would rate that one much higher. But as a follow up this one was a disappointment. So much so that I didn't bother to see the third one. Thats how boring I thought 'The two towers' was."

Nothing I, or indeed anyone else, can say should help you to form an opinion prior to watching. I guess the audience for the three films fall into two categories; those who have read the books and those who have not. Those who have not, in my experience, tend to be overwhelmed by the absolute majesty of the vision but a little non-plussed by the actual story - seeing it as just some rather dopey fantasy; a Star Wars trilogy set in past times for the modern audience if you like. Then there is the \"yes, I have read the books\" class who in general seem to have a kind of smug arrogance grounded in comments such as \"they left out too much\", \"its not what I imagined\" or \"Of course its all an allegory for the rise of the third Reich\". Tolkein bemoaned the lack of an heroic mythology for the English people and he sought to create one in his Rings trilogy of books. My opinion is too humble to count - but if you want it, I believe he succeeded. The epic backdrop, the heroes and villains, the rich history, the races and the languages are all utterly plausible as a long cherished story handed down over many generations. Peter Jackson and his team must be congratulated not only for their wonderful realisation of Middle Eath and its inhabitants; but for crafting a series a movies that captured the very essence of what Tolkein was trying to achieve. Well done also for leaving out Tom Bombadil."

The key was how I looked at the key character of this film: \"Gollum\" (Andy Serkis.). Once I began to appreciate and marvel at this weasel-like character, my opinion of the film went from bad to good. That doesn't mean I like that slimy creature: I don't, but I am more fascinated by him rather than totally annoyed as I was with the first viewing. A big reason was that I put on the English subtitles, so I was able to understand everything he said. I recommend doing that you has a similar problem deciphering his dialog. Now I more fully understood what a tortured soul that pathetic creature was.\n\nAnyway, this second installment, as in the first, offers a lot of fascinating sights and sounds and a nice varied platter of action scenes and wild characters. For younger kids, I am to happy to say there is absolutely nothing, language-wise, that would offend anyone but the violence is heavy and brutal at times.\n\nThis is a solid, highly-recommended second installment in the trilogy. It's epic film-making. No, it may not be equal to the first - The Fellowship Of The Ring - but what adventure story is?"

        "review_detailed_main": "So the journey continues with 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.' This review will assume you have seen the first film, 'The Fellowship of the Ring.' Which is fine because Peter Jackson, at the helm of this massive production, assumes you have seen it as well. Intelligently, Jackson does not begin with a redundant and unnecessary prologue. He dives right into what the filmmakers considered the hardest of the trilogy to make.\n\nWhen we left the fellowship, they were in shambles. Gandalf had fallen; Merry and Pippen were kidnapped by the evil forces; Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli seek their smaller comrades without the help of Boromir, who has also died; this leaves Frodo and Sam on their way to Mount Doom, the one ring still in their grasp.\n\n'The Two Towers' is more successful than 'Fellowship' because the storytelling becomes more complex without drowning us in information. The first film introduced us to the many characters of Middle Earth (too many, I believe). 'The Two Towers' isn't quite as concerned with exposition, though new characters do come on board. Merry and Pippin meet Treebeard, a large, talking \"tree herder\" who is concerned about the plight of his forest's future since the destructive orcs and their masters, Sauron and Saruman, burn everything in their path.\n\nLegolas, Aragorn, and Gimli enter the kingdom of Rohan and cross paths with King Theoden and his people. Theoden has been under Saruman's spell as part of he and Sauron's master plan to take over the separate kingdoms of Middle Earth. Eowyn, the king's niece, develops a special liking for Aragorn. However, as we understand from the first film, there is still a deep love between Aragorn and the elf Arwen. Along with the rest of the elfs of Middle Earth, Arwen is persuaded to leave for another world entirely. She does have reservations leaving her true love Aragorn, though mortal and she is not, for distant lands and never see him again.\n\nFrodo and Sam are introduced to the mysterious Gollum, who attempts to attack the hobbits in their sleep to regain the ring. Instead, Gollum and Frodo kindle a special relationship since they both harbor a certain addiction to the ring's power. Frodo's Elijah Wood is the most effective actor in 'Two Towers' as he is gradually taken more and more over by the ring and it's awesome strength. Gollum becomes Frodo and Sam's guide to Mordor, as he has been there before. Gollum's intentions, though, are never clear to the hobbits - neither are they to Gollum.\n\nThese three strands of story form a massive, thoroughly effective, epic tale of nature vs. machine, creature vs. creature and, through Frodo, man vs. himself. The encompassing story leads to a heroic battle sequence fought on two fronts, while all the time we wonder how long Frodo can hold on to his sanity as the ring slowly takes power over him.\n\nThe pacing, which was an issue with 'Fellowship,' is not problematic at all the second time around. The three stories are told in a manner that flows right through the three hour+ tale. One problem that persists is that 'Two Towers' is largely unaffected by the humanity other than Frodo's saga. There is love between Aragorn and Arwen, Eowyn also shows up as a romantic character. Her father, Theoden, is a courageous man but flawed psychologically. There exists connections between these many characters and more but they all feel half baked and cast aside to make more room for fighting.\n\nStill, 'The Two Towers' is enormously successful as a narrative and even more ambitious than 'Fellowship' visually. The score, by Howard Shore, is among the very best ever composed. The evil orcs and uruk-hai never look fake and evoke terror in the characters and in the audience. I still yearn for a more personal story, but in other realms of film-making, Peter Jackson and those under his command have outdone themselves. ***.5 out of ****"

I wouldn't say this is one of the 10 best movies ever made, but it's still very entertaining. And I think it really has to be seen on a big screen to be fully appreciated. I also liked the humor brought by characters like Gimli. But Gollum was a bit too present in the movie. My favorite characters: Arwen (Liv Tyler), Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), King Theoden of Rohan (Bernard Hill) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom). Too bad that the Arwen and Galadriel characters are not more important.\n\nOut of 100, I gave it 88.

Every shot is beyond impressive; there isn't any adjective that I can use that would do the movie justice.\n\nAnd Gollum? Now there's an intriguing character, precious. An awe-inspiring, if pitiful, being, he makes you really want to see part 3, just to see what will happen. \"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\" is truly one movie that will continue to inspire people for years.

The only thing I found entertaining besides the effects was Smeagol, or whatever its name is, that thing stole the show.

Yeah, Bakshi took SOME liberties but at least he kept to the story of FOTR and TT. Jackson, at points, seems to be telling a completely different tale and re-writing characters when it amuses him.\n\nI didn't think it was possible to make Tolkien boring but, unhappily, Jackson's TT proved me wrong. I wasn't the only one checking my watch many times during the film. I noticed several people in the audience doing the same.\n\nNow, I will say I did like the Director's Cut version of FOTR. However, I hated TT so much that I doubt I will even find the DC version appealing.\n\nPlease, don't label me a purist, as that suggests unwillingness to accept different visions or interpretations of Mr. Tolkien's work. I do not mind changes being made to the story --- when they are good ones. However, Mr. Jackson and his gang of ink flinging scribes are not sophisticated enough writers to make these changes work or ring true.\n\nThe wafer-thin melodrama he adds into TT, in order to build suspense, is laughable and obvious. Aragorn getting carried over the cliff edge was nothing more than another Hollywood cliche, already seen hundreds of times in other films, meant to keep the viewing masses on the edge of their seats. Come on!!! LOTR has not been so popular for all these long years for nothing. There is already enough suspense, drama and action in this epic. PLEASE, Mr. Jackson, don't add your muck."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is one of the best films ever made. This film is almost as breathtaking as the first film but in the end the minor flaws it has makes it worse than the first film. What I consider to be the biggest flaw of this film is the character of Gimli. John-Rhys Davies is a wonderful actor and I do not blame him for the way the character turned out. I blame it on the directing (shame on you Jackson). Being that Merry and Pippin are not as much in the second films they were in the first they could not act as comic relief. Thus the choice was made to make Gimli the comic relief. While the things he says are both funny and well timed it becomes to much by the end. A second flaw that pulls the film down a bit is the fact that they deviated too much from the original book. The Theoden character is very different in the book as is Faramir. These flaws were probably necessary to make the film but the hard core Tolkien fans such as myself were disappointed to see Faramir drag poor Frodo and Sam to Osgilliath which is only mentioned in the book but never seen. This far I have only focused on the bad things in the film but there are very great film historic moments as well. E.g. the battle for Helms Deep is aside from the battle on Pelleanor Fields the greatest film battle ever conceived on screen. The acting in the film is generally on a very high level. Especially Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen do very well in the film but also John-Rhys Davies and Elijah Wood are very good. Aside from the fact that their roles were not as well written as they could have been Bernard Hill and David Wenham do very well. The effects in the film are flawless and on a higher scale than in the first film and the attention to detail is overwhelming. All in all a worthy sequel but ultimately the worst out of the three."

This was probably one of the first times such a large role was so successfully entirely digital, and definitely that it had such an impact. You feel for him, and you frankly forget that he's not \"really\" there. He can also be kind of funny. The humor in general is good. This picks up where the first one left off, and with several nifty surprises(for those not familiar with the novels, or who haven't had it spoiled) along the way, the plot progresses nicely. The pace is smooth, and this doesn't seem as if it actually is the three hours long that it is. This creates moods well, being creepy, light, gloomy, etc. at different points. The action and battle sequences are exciting and awesome, not to mention well-choreographed. Every acting performance is spot-on. Even baby-face Wood and dull Bloom are impeccable. The effects are astonishing. This has an epic scope, and has a magnificent, grand score. The characters are interesting and credible. This leaves you wondering what will happen next, and I'm very much looking forward to catching the last one. There are scary scenes in this, and it might be beyond what some children can handle. I recommend this to anyone that can imagine liking it, and who have watched the first one. 10/10"

This is the movie that changed the movie industry and set foot for the digital actors (3D Animation). This movie is a living legend, a god, and will rule for a century in my opinion.\n\nSeriously, if you have not seen this trilogy, go and see it as soon as possible, as it is not just a movie about medieval times, it has everything a real movie should: Beautiful people (not a single ugly face), amazing art, incredible places (looks like heaven with skies of many colors, water and so much more). The acting is superb, the best in the world, they really hired the BEST out there, and as far as I can see, the movie was awesome because they did not allowed the motion picture to be corrupted with \"political\" reasons, so, all the actors, Post-production, sound, effects and everything else was really the BEST, no corrupted piece!!!!\n\nThe story is immortal, will get you in tears no matter what you are made of. The characters... so well done!!!\n\nDo you know why this movie is so good? I will tell my opinion on it: I think it is THAT good, because Peter Jackson worked on it for more than 10 years (was forced to wait 10 years because no one wanted to give him the green light to shoot), that is why, it is a good way to ensure a good quality."

It follows the fellowship being divided and facing evil on all sides. There's battles galore, tons of action, incredible sets and special effects, breathtaking scenery and the usual great direction from Peter Jackson. The acting is just so-so except for (surprisingly) Viggo Mortensen. I wasn't impressed with him in the first movie but he improved vastly in this one--a very subtle but physical performance. His scenes with Liv Tyler were especially moving. It runs for 3 hours but it flew by and I was never bored. The battle at Helms Deep is easily among one of the most incredible action sequences ever caught on film. A definite must-see. I can't wait for \"Return of the King\"!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I was lucky enough to win a pair of tickets to see a premiere showing of \"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\". Needless to say I was pretty excited because for as long as I can remember I've been a great admirer of Tolkien and huge fan of the first Lord of the Rings film. I wasn't disappointed with 'The Two Towers'. Peter Jackson draws you into the film with the opening score, and leaves you breathless until the very end. The story line picks up where Jackson left off - a continuation of the first rather than another movie altogether. (I'm going to reveal the starting plot so please don't read ahead if you don't want to know.)\n\nMerry and Pippin have managed to escape from the Orks that have held them capture, only to run into even more interesting creatures in the woods: Ents, trees that can move and speak.\n\nAragorn, Legolas and Gimli are trying to rescue Merry and Pippin when they run into someone they didn't expect, Gandalf - back and now a white wizard, the highest a wizard can go. After being assured of the two young hobbits' safety, they travel to the kingdom of Rohan where Saruman holds the King in an evil spell. After freeing the king they must prepare for Saruman's army, which sole purpose is to destroy the world of men. The Battle of Helm's Deep (which can be quite disturbing at points, not for the very young or those who can't handle that kind of thing) decides the winner. (Peter Jackson spent over a month filming this scene and all that time was not wasted - it was a fantastic scene, well thought out and captivating.)\n\nFrodo and Sam are trying to reach Mordor but find themselves lost. After an encounter with the creature Gollum, who at one point possessed the ring and maddingly wants it back, Frodo (who is beginning to feel the true weight of the ring) decides to let Gollum guide them. Gollum wasn't much different from a hobbit before he possessed the ring, and was called Smeagol. In the movie 'The Two Towers' you are able to see the struggle that takes place within Gollum. Smeagol represents the good left inside of him, and Gollum the bad. These scenes were some of my favourites - they were wonderfully shot and really took the film to another level.\n\nAnd of course we can't forget the lovely elvish and thus immortal Arwen, who is faced with the choice of staying with her beloved Aragorn or leaving forever with her people; there's the nephew of King Theoden, the strong and noble Eomer who will do anything for Rohan, and his equally strong and lovely sister Eowyn who develops feelings for Aragorn; and lastly Faramir, the brother of the late Boromir, now Captain to Gondor.\n\nThis movie didn't feel like a movie. I honestly felt as though I had been pulled into the screen in the theatre. It was fantasticly shot, preformed, and directed. 'The Two Towers' is the classic tale of good against evil. It is perfectly carried through. There was not a moment I didn't savour - I didn't want this film to end and will be seeing it again in theatres the next chance I get. If anything, I think I enjoyed this film more than the first. And although I understand this movie isn't for everyone, I still highly recommend it to all. I give it a 9 out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Fellowship has been broken, Frodo and Sam travel towards Mordor alone, Merry and Pippin have been taken by orcs, Gandalf and Boromir have fallen and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli must make haste to save at least some of their comrades. And at the same time the threat of Mordor grows as war comes to Rohan, the land of the horselords.\n\nIt is an epic in the every meaning of the word, and possibly one of the best second parts of a trilogy in the history of cinema. Sure, all three of the movies were shot back to back, but the fact still remains that middle parts of any kind of story are often the hardest. You have already established the setting, introduced the main characters, yet you still have to hold back until the end finale.\n\nThe Two Towers solves this by giving us one amazing opening battle in the War of the Rings. The Battle of Helm's Deep, still considered to be one of the greatest battles put on film, and for a good reason. It is cinema at its finest. The huge scale of it, the special effects, the practical effects, the pacing, the score, the fury and the stages.\n\nBut we also have other good stuff to tide us until the end of the film. The movie jumps around quite a bit, juggling various plot lines, and they all work very well. And, most importantly, this movie introduces some great new characters. Bernard Hill plays the role of Theoden, King of Rohan, and he is a very fitting counterpoint to Aragorn. He's an aged monarch, a warrior past his prime, and thus frailer, but also possessing pride in his status as a ruler. Very good performance, one of my personal favourites. But it's Gollum (Andy Serkis) that everyone always mention, and for a good reason. In many ways he's the most important character in the whole story. He's the tragedy under all the heroics, noble sacrifices and great deeds. He's the dark shadow, the weakness of mortals made flesh. Without him Frodo's struggles wouldn't mean half as much. And Serkis plays him perfectly. He's a marvel of special effects and man's ability to slip into a role. Especially considering that he's essentially two characters molded into one.\n\nThe Two Towers is a great film on all levels. It transitions us from the origin stories of The Fellowship towards the grand battles of the Return of the King, all the while keeping the story flowing smoothly and keeping us firmly in the mood for Middle-Earth. Masterfully done, Mr. Jackson."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a stunning middle chapter in Peter Jackson's epic film trilogy, bringing to life the second book in J. R. R. Tolkien's beloved fantasy series with breathtaking visuals and heart-stopping action. The film picks up where its predecessor, The Fellowship of the Ring, left off, with the Fellowship broken and scattered and the forces of darkness closing in on Middle-earth.\n\nAs the film unfolds, we follow the separate journeys of Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) as they make their way towards Mordor to destroy the One Ring, and of Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) as they try to rescue Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) from the clutches of the evil wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) and the orc army.\n\nThe film is a masterclass in world-building and visual storytelling, with Jackson and his team of talented artists and designers bringing to life the breathtaking landscapes of Middle-earth and the terrifying armies of orcs and uruk-hai. The film's action sequences are thrilling and intense, with standout moments including the epic Battle of Helm's Deep and the tense confrontation between Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the Balrog.\n\nBut what really sets The Two Towers apart is its exploration of themes of loyalty, sacrifice, and the power of friendship. As the characters face impossible odds and grapple with their own doubts and fears, their bonds with one another are tested and strengthened, creating emotional moments that are both heart-wrenching and uplifting.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a riveting and unforgettable chapter in one of the greatest film trilogies of all time. With its stunning visuals, thrilling action, and powerful themes, it raises the stakes and sets the stage for an epic conclusion in The Return of the King."

Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli follow the orcs who took Merry and Pippin while also making an alliance with the Riders of Rohan. Later on, they would make plans to escort the people to Helm's Deep were they will fight against them.\n\nThe story in this movie is not only a very faithful adaptation like the last film, but it's also effective in it's emotional gravitas and world building. That way, it helps you learn the situation the broken Fellowship are into and their plans to fight back against the Orcs. Plus the themes of family and overcoming their prejudices are well executed. Howard Shore continues to make haunting beautiful music that enchanted the action and atmosphere of Middle Earth.\n\nThe production design and costumes are as beautiful as ever, the direction and editing are very sharp, and the action choreography is superb especially in Helm's Deep. And then there's the strong acting from everyone involved.\n\nElijah Wood and Sean Astin go great together as did Andy Serkis as Gollum (in his solid motion capture). Viggo Mortenson, Orlando Bloom, John Rhys Davies, Ian Mckellon, Christopher Lee, Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan also did great. Other actors like Karl Urban, Brad Dourif, Miranda Otto, and Bernard Hill did very superb job.\n\nOverall, The Two Towers is a great continuation of the cinematic trilogy and still holds up after 20 years."

I laughed at any scene with Gimli in it (He's such a joy in this whole series) and with Ents being so slow. 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' makes you feel so many emotions.\n\nOf course, the movie quality is just perfection: story, camera, setting, acting, and everything else. Especially, longs shots of nature and wilderness is majestic and brings the whole story to its root: Middle-Earth. War sequences overwhelm me every single time. However, the strongest advantage of this movie is that it invites viewers into their journey. I am in other place at other time fighting the war with hobbits, elves, wizards, men, and dwarves. Portraying the war in this movie is fantastic technically, but making me feel like I AM a part of this war is just perfection."

        "review_detailed_main": "To be quite honest I did not believe I could watch the Lord of the Rings trilogy twice, not that I don't like it. On the contrary it's one of the films that strike me the most. Only problem is that each episode runtime is well over 3 hours and that stretches over 4 hours if you count the TV commercials in, which means an enjoyable movie has become a huge commitment as well as a physical challenge. However, given I was in New Zealand a couple of months ago for a second time and Hobbiton and Wetashop were part of that journey, I have been inspired to watch this show again and re-review it.\n\nLOTR - what an all-age, all-gender and all-culture silver screen sensation for its generation! From storyline to metaphor, costume to makeup, background to scenery, sound to music, cast to crew, cinematography to acting, there's not a single box it doesn't tick.\n\nStoryline has rugged layers (often interpreted as conflicts) which movies rely on. A journey to Mount Mordor is fraught with dangers, perils and treachery. All these are amplified by each and single character's struggle and pain, which are finally overcome by love, trust, courage, determination, friendship and companionship.\n\nSeasoned and accomplished actors have undoubtedly demonstrated those traits. Elijah Wood, Sean Austin, Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen, Cate Blanchett, Orlando Bloom, Liv Tyler, Sean Bean, Hugo Weaving and many others have all played an exceptional role in living their characters, so much so that the strong cast in LOTR trilogy has made its The Hobbit trilogy sequel a lackluster.\n\nCostume and makeup are well toned in that they fit perfectly with the characters. Women's dresses, men's armors, cookware and even the cute lembas bread all resemble those in ancient Roman Empire times. The acoustics of its sound and music and the grandeur in fighting scenes are simply breathtaking, striking a remarkable resemblance to Troy (2004), making it literally a legendary ancient war movie.\n\nAs usual I would like to touch on the metaphor of each movie simply because good films should always do more than just describing the story. They need to convey the underlying message. Human's greed and craving for power is demonstrated throughout, not just by the evil spirit but also by those with a good heart. After all we live in a real world full of deceit and temptations. Yet it is those characters like courage, determination, caring and compassion that see us through. A lot of people say Samwise Gamgee is the unsung hero and I totally agree with that. His unfailing loyalty and faithfulness to his friend Frodo Baggins unchallenged bring a tear or two to his audiences. He just has an adorable chubby face I want to pinch - in a fond way of course.\n\nOnce again I must mention the filming locations that inspired me to re-watch and re-review this show. I want to give special thanks to Hobbiton Movie Set Tours for showing me the cute Hobbit village. The Hobbit houses, the hills, the trees, the grasses, the bridge, and the water mill are all fondly reflected in the movie. That is probably one of the reasons for traveling the world to stamp those filming locations. One goof I must point out though - in the closing scene when Samwise Gamgee walks back to his house with his family, the actor actually bends down over the door frame because the hobbit houses are quite low while the actors are in real size..."

I don't have as much to say for this one as the last one, because it's a continuation of the same story, but I will try. The acting, once again, was phenomenal. The comic relief, even though it appears in the midst of serious dilemmas, is still really funny, and well done. The tension comes and goes when it is needed, and when it is necessary. The camera work is great, and the final battle scene is just super epic! You know a battle scene is good when it lasts half an hour and you don't get bored of it. I can't wait to watch the final movie of this trilogy, but I'm also shocked at the fact that it's four hours long! It's really impressive how a single trilogy can be eleven whole hours long."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is definitely a very entertaining film and the special effects are terrific but I don't think its as good a film as the first one. We've come to know the characters already so the film dives right in with the action while the first film took its time setting up the story. I do have one major gripe in this film and its the part of the film with the two hobbits Merry and Pippin and those tree creatures. The film comes to a screeching halt when the scenes shift to that part. The tree creatures talk slow, walk slow and all the scenes with them crawl along like a drunk snail. Another complaint I have is Ian McKellen as Gandolf is hardly in the film at all. And Cate Blanchett has only one scene! The most exciting part of the film is the battle at Helm's Deep of course. These scenes are not only exciting but very impressive looking as far as filmmaking is concerned. This part of the film is really an achievement. Of course during the whole course of this bloody battle the character Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) never gets hurt. So while this is going on Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) are off in another direction battling Christopher Lee. So they're really is three stories going on at the same time. Where the first film took its time in its narrative this film plunges head first into action. The two films really are different. This is an extremely well made film and Peter Jackson should be proud but I don't think its a great film. Impressive looking and very entertaining but I'm hoping the third film will be better."

        "review_detailed_main": "Some of us may know the back story of how Tolkien himself never wanted his books to be made into a film and I have to say that I agree with him, much of the magic of his books were in the finer details and these could never be conveyed well in a film. Here we have a film that's well done in some ways yet in the grand scheme of things it was never needed, the books stand alone and this trilogy of movies are a perhaps selfish project? -that are essentially a compromised vision of the books, this big budget 'action' movie would serve those looking for a feast of CGI effects and action sequences, thankfully there is some subtlety and the interplay between characters is the films saving grace and I appreciate the tasteful selection of dialog used for the most part. One of my big beefs with The Two Towers and the other 2 movies is just how nonthreatening Sauron is in these films, I think this aspect weakens the movies a great deal, even the ring wraiths come across as impotent compared to creatures such as the Urak Hai. Another is the abrupt transitions between scenes, and the movies lose much of the 'glue' that the books had tying everything together. Finally 'some' of the CGI effects don't do justice to the imagination - Sauron's eye, and the faces in the dead marsh seem to suffer like Gladrieal did in the previous movie - a little bit too overly dramatic and washed out - I am only mentioning this as a comparison to the majority of effects in this movies which are actually very well done. Also the costumes are excellent, I especially thought the depictions of the orcs were excellent. Overall I can only give this 5 stars."

I found myself less invested in some of the story elements, particularly when they involved the human characters (which occupied much of the runtime). Though not as strong as Fellowship or RoTK, this movie is full of spectacular moments.\n\nThe Battle of Helm's Deep might be the best battle in cinematic history. From the driving force to the action to the gravitas, everything about that sequence is jaw-dropping. Though incredibly dark and serious, the humor is spot-on and adds a needed layer of character development.\n\nOn top of the action, what this movie does well is develop relationships between characters. Frodo and Sam, Legolas and Gimli, Frodo and Sm\u00e9agol, Aragorn and \u00c9owyn, and beyond. The relationships in this film are superb and help push the story forward.\n\nWhen I want to watch incredible action and The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a great movie in an amazing trilogy.\n\nBest Character: Gimli Best Moment: The Battle of Helm's Deep (the entire thing) Best Quote: \"Toss me.\" - Gimli."

I have no idea why, maybe by mistake, maybe on purpose, it played this weekend on screen in one theater in Bandung, Indonesia. Walking around the shopping mall, I noticed that 3 movies were on for the nightmovie: Harry Potter, The Chamber of secrets, Treasure Planet and yes, The Two Towers. Impressive...hardly any words for this movie. Fans of Tolkien can be satisfied, again, a great masterpiece has reached the theaters around the world. In number 2 of the trilogy, the tension and excitement builds up. The separate journeys of Frodo & Sam, their friends preparing for battle, never fighting for the attention of the watcher. The characters come out better in this movie, although I still miss the singing as described in the books of Tolkien. Hobbits like to sing, so why is this not an important part of the movie? maybe cause the actors can't sing? The new introduced caracters are not to many, and it feels as if you know everyone personally. The producers as well as the actors of \"The Lord of the Rings\" do a magic job. The armies are impressive, and you feel almost emotionally connected with the forces who try to win over evil. Actually, there are no words to describe what is happening here. After years of watching movies, this is the first time ever, I was reluctant to leave the theater...... I think in general, The Two Towers is slightly better than \"fellowship of the ring\" and I already voted for 10 points there. Please, can I give 10+ this time?"

        "review_detailed_main": "Admittedly, I think The Two Towers is quite easily the weakest movie in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It's cursed to sit as a stopgap between the immensely satisfying and exciting first installment, and the epic and emotional final film. However, when its inherent disadvantage is taken into account, it's pretty incredible that it's as good as it is.\n\nAnd The Two Towers is still very, very good. Everything that was of high quality in the first movie is still on display here, as far as all the technical aspects go. It does also have an amazing final hour, with the Battle of Helm's Deep being one of the best single large-scale battles depicted in recent film history. It's exciting no matter how many times you see it. The Two Towers is also the film that introduces Gollum, and it's impressive how well he holds up as a CGI character over 20 years later.\n\nThe only way The Two Towers suffers a bit is through its pacing. It expands the scope of the series considerably in a very short amount of time, and it always feel jarring being introduced to so many new characters while also coming to terms with the fact that all the previously established characters are off doing their own thing.\n\nIt makes The Two Towers feel a little messier and less compelling when compared to the other two movies, but if you watch all the films within a short amount of time, it fits in well with the other movies. Assessed as its own film, it probably has the most flaws, but if judged purely as a stepping stone between film #1 and film #3, it's absolutely a success."

It is two stories - one is that of Frodo and Sam making their painful way to Mordor with Gollum as a guide and that part is tedious to the extreme while Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are having a much more exciting time at the Battle of Helm's Deep. In true middle-volume form, the tone of this movie is quite dark. The Fellowship has been broken, and things seem to grow ever worse for its fragments as they pursue their separate quests, until the plot ends abrubtly with yet another turn for the worse. It may be typical of trilogies for the second volume to take the story ever-darker, but here the story gets more complex. This one has the war of Helm's Deep, and you know things are going to get worse before they get better."

These changes simply represented how the director wanted the books to go and the heck with Tolkein.\n\nThere was much to like about the movie in terms of art direction and special effects. Unfortunately, so much attention went to creating digital characters (and I'll say that Gollum was nicely done in large part to Andy Serkis' work) that the real actors were left to stand around and watch, or react to what the virtual characters were doing, which was the downfall of \"Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.\" Thankfully Gollum was no Jar Jar Binks, but it still created a similar issue. The relationships between the characters in \"Fellowship of the Ring\" were beautiful and moving, and now all of a sudden everyone's emotionally disconnected with each other - except for Arwen and Strider, and Arwen never once set foot in the \"Two Towers\" book! Ugh.\n\nI'm no purist where Tolkein is concerned and I would have been able to live with small changes necessary to make a movie. For example, I can understand why the film didn't end at the same place that the book did and that didn't bother me too much. Nevertheless, there were some very rich scenes in Tolkein's novel (from the growing friendship between Legolas and Gimli, to some very moving moments between Frodo and Sam, one of which awakens the best out of Gollum for a moment) that were ignored and replaced by Mr. Jackson's own ideas. This I cannot live with and makes me very angry. I hope he gets back to Tolkein's world when he finishes the last movie because I don't like Jackson's."

This one follows three stories one of Frodo and Sam on their way to Mordor, one of the two hobbits kidnapped in the first one, and the other of Aragon, Gimley, and Legolos and their encounters. The one that is the main focus to me was the Aragon tale and it was by far the best. The other two were good as well, but most of the battles happened in the Aragon parts of the story. I also really enjoyed the expanded roles of Gimley the Drawf and Legolos the elf. Great effects also abound in this one as the creature Gollum looks a lot better than I thought it would. Just a great movie, I can't believe there are people that gave this movie a 1. I mean even if you hated some part of it the scenery alone makes the at least a 3. I am thinking these people were dragged to the movie kicking and screaming which is why you should never take someone to a movie they don't want to see cause then they give it a 1 out of spite. It is either that or they are star wars fans who can't stand that there movies don't get the great reviews anymore."

The series of battles that make up this film are so incredible. Though made at the same time, the tales gain the advantage of advances in production techniques and graphics. There is not much exposition here, though new characters are made available to us. It is rather to get from point A to point B and make way for the final book. The rocky relationship between Frodo and Sam continues, Frodo fixated on the ring and all that it implies. Then there are the magnificent battle scenes with the unlikeliest of creatures forming alliances. I read reviews by people who are so into these books that they nitpick over every aberration from the original works. This is a movie. It's accessible to anyone, including those who will never make their way through the novel. The novels aren't for everyone. They are filled with long introspective meanderings and a good deal of poetry (hardly any of which is in any of the three films). Like with Trekkies, it's hard to talk with these people because of the obsessiveness about a single piece of literature--the betrayal they feel. Just enjoy what Peter Jackson was able to do. It will live forever in film history."

        "review_detailed_main": "Peter Jackson has done what could not be done. Deemed unfilmable for decades (with the terrible cartoons as an example of why), \"The Lord of the Rings\" took the audiences by storm when \"Fellowship of the Ring\" premiered in 2001. In 2002, anticipation was even higher, dread was lower -- and \"Two Towers\" is an outstanding continuation of the epic fantasy tale. The movie picks up where \"Fellowship\" left off: Merry and Pippin have been captured by Uruk-hai, and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are pursuing them. But they are sidetracked by an old friend: Gandalf, returned in a new form and with new powers, as Gandalf the White. He takes them to the kingdom of Rohan, whose king is bewitched by the evil Saruman. They barricade the people of Rohan in the fortress of Helm's Deep, for a final defiant stand against an army of Uruk-hai. Sam and Frodo have left, to venture into Mordor alone so that Frodo can destroy the Ring in Mordor's Mount Doom. When the two hobbits become lost in Emyn Muil, Frodo realizes that someone is following them: Gollum, the tormented, twisted former owner of the Ring. They capture Gollum, who swears to serve \"the master of the Precious.\" But even Gollum's shaky allegiance isn't enough for them to succeed, because the Ring has started to bend Frodo to its will. While the first movie revolved around Frodo, the Ring and the Fellowship, here the focus widens. We get a better sense of the epic quality of the story and how it affects the whole world, not just our heroes. Gondor is crumbling, Rohan is beaten down by orcs, and even the forces of nature -- the tree-like ents -- are being attacked by Sauron and Saruman. It's nature versus the destructive machines, and the wild wrecking of Saruman's forges by these ancient tree shepherds is something to cheer for. Elijah Wood blossoms in this film as Frodo Baggins, the little hobbit who could. In the first movie Wood played Frodo as an innocent who loses his innocence; here he takes it a step further, showing the darkness and violence that are swallowing Frodo up. Because we saw what a bright, sweet person Frodo was before, it's all the more horrible to see him starting to slide down (even attacking his best friend -- the look on Frodo's face as he comes to his senses is stunning). Sean Astin perfectly embodies Sam Gamgee -- increasingly desperate, trying to keep Frodo from going under. He serves as a reminder of what Frodo is fighting for, and Astin has perhaps the most powerful lines of the film, near the end: \"But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer.\" These simply-worded lines will bring tears to your eyes. But if Frodo is just starting to be addicted, Gollum is a junkie. Even if Andy Serkis doesn't appear in one frame in the entire movie, his motions and voice are heard and seen behind an exquisitely detailed CGI puppet. This is no Jar Jar or Dobby -- Gollum is detailed down to the last hair and wrinkle, believable in his appearance (I actually forgot he was animated for most of the movie), and has a multifaceted personality that reflects his own inner struggle -- Smeagol and Gollum, good and evil. The scene where Gollum's two halves argue is too amazing for words. The other supporting actors shine almost as brightly. Viggo Mortensen turns his reluctant hero Aragorn into a leader and a warrior. Ian McKellen manages to make Gandalf more stately and majestic, yet keeps that little grandfatherly twinkle. John Rhys-Davies provides a bit of comedy as Gimli, mostly related to Gimli's stature, but never loses his dignity; Orlando Bloom is outstanding as ethereal elf archer Legolas once again. Liv Tyler captures Arwen's fear of mortality and loneliness. Billy Boyd's Pippin and Dominic Monaghan's Merry, the well-meaning goofballs of \"Fellowship,\" are now forced to make their own decisions. And new cast members Miranda Otto and Bernard Hill also shine as the strong-willed Eowyn and tough old king Theoden, in roles that will bloom further in the third film. Peter Jackson (who makes a few cameos) once again outdoes himself with camera-work and direction. His cameras as like living things: they swoop, dive, pull back for outstanding combat shots and then zoom in for exquisite close-ups. The battle scenes are dark, bloody, explosive, and full of chaos; only near the finale does any hint of glory shine through. He adds little human touches (the family split up by the war) that give a glimpse of what the non-heroic, ordinary people are suffering. Of course \"Two Towers\" isn't as good as the book. Few movies are. But taken purely as a cinematic experience, and an adaptation, \"Two Towers\" is virtually without peer. Epic, majestic, action-packed and brimming with pathos, this is a treasure."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Two Towers\" is every bit as engrossing and well-developed as its predecessor, plus I believe its new characters (those not introduced in \"Fellowship\") are some of the most intriguing ever conceived and put on film. You have Gollum, King Theoden, Eowen, Faramir, Grima, Treebeard and many others. Peter Jackson chose the absolute best actors for his trilogy, I'll give no ground on that point. One might argue about Gollum and Treebeard's categorization as \"actors\", but I say that whether they're CG or human, someone had to write the script and imagine the expressions. The existing characters are developed even more deeply in TT. Sam's humanity, Frodo's compassion, Aragorn's evolving kingship, Arwen's deep love, Gandalf's new transcendent presence, all add richly to the middle chapter of the trilogy. For epic \"sweep\", you'll have to go far to match TT. The scenes at Helm's Deep, with all of the defenders bunkered in as the numberless forces of Sauron converge on them, is the very picture of desperation, and Jackson masterfully gives us both breadth and detail. Gollum's split-personality conflicts as \"Smeagol/Gollum\" are nothing short of perfect, and unlike mainstream movies, we aren't spoonfed the reasoning behind his condition, we just get to puzzle it out for ourselves, like intelligent humans! What a relief. Howard Shore's score is again one I'd buy for myself.\n\nI think that the main criticism of TT on this board is that the movie is dull, or that it relies too heavily on special effects. On the \"dullness\" comment, I'd say that what's one viewer's \"dullness\" is another's character development, dialogue, and foreshadowing. It's called \"filmmaking\", along the lines of Kubrick and the Merchant/Ivory team. On the special effects comments, I'd counter that if special effects add to the plot and don't distract, then I'm perfectly OK with them. Now, I wouldn't be drawn to a film totally comprised of special effects, but TT is nothing like that. It's employment of them is only for the sake of plot and believeability. Would you want some guy playing Gollum, heavily made up, and totally false? No thanks. I bought the general release DVD yesterday, instead of waiting for the extended version, which I will purchase also. I only hope that TT's extended version is as fantastic as Fellowship's turned out to be."

I fell in love with all these new actors I've either heard of, or never knew them. I loved it so much, I watch all of them 1,2, and 3!!! I never seem to get enough, it's like every time I watch one of the Lord of the Rings movies, it's a whole knew adventure. This was the first trilogy to see with strictly my dad and brother. That was our thing, we even went to see the Harry Potter trilogy but it's not finished of course. But anyway the three of us went to see the second one, Two Towers. Once the movie started we couldn't of been more thrilled!!(Im so glad I saw all of them on the big screen!!) All of our actors were great and the theatre was so loud! All of a sudden this creature named gollom comes down this mountain above frodo and sam... I don't think I had been so creeped out by this hideous thing, I even remember leaning against my father! I cant ever forget all of them! Elijah wood (frodo) Sean Astin (sam) Viggo Mortensin (Arigon) Orlando Bloom (Leagolas) John Rhys Davies (gimli and Treebeard) Ein Mkellen (Gandalf the Grey/white) Christopher Lee (sarumon)Billy Boyd (pippen)Cate Blanchett (galadriel)Liv Tyler (Arwen) Hugo Weaving (elrond)Dominic Monaghan (Merry)Miranda Otto (Eowyn)Bernard Hill (theoden)I loved all of them but I just think... personally The One actor who blew me away with his performance and worked soo hard for the film.... the one and only Andy Serkis. I don't understand why just because it was CGI that he couldn't get an academy for best actor... it gives me chills that he came that close to getting it!!! And yet he works so hard all those expressions and body movement are his.... that voice,HIS!!!!!!!!! For those who commented that they were surprised to see him act well out of the CGI well in order to do CGI you have to be a good acter with good expressions. Smeagal was him!!! cant you see that!!? Well, everyone was brilliant, great job Peter, a trilogy that will be remembered in movie cinema forever."

I love the tension and overall sense of gloom the actors, and more noteably, the score portray for us. Rohan seems like it would normally be a beautiful, bright, happy place, but a dark shadow has fallen over it. Very well done in this sense. Sometimes, it is just dreadfully quiet as the actors deliver their lines with just a hint of music in the background. When Eomer delivers the line....\"Do not trust to hope, it has forsaken these lands.\" it still gives me goose bumps. Same with Theoden as he conveys his sense of being alone in this fight at Helm's Deep to Aragorn...\"Yes, my Lord Aragorn, we ARE alone.\" Awesome....\n\nSome other awesome things I loved about this movie:\n\n-Gimli is hilarious...him and Legolas also interact well -The Uruks are just some bad mothers...I love them and hate them -The Battle of Helm's Deep is so tense and nervy...not to mention great action -Boromir flashback by Faramir was incredible, and necessary -Gollum......enough said -PO-TA-TOES!!! I love that scene...still cracks me up. -The Nazgul on the fell beasts are scary! -The dead marshes totally creep me out...well done -The Ents attacking Isengard was one of the coolest things to watch\n\n-Even though totally fabricated...I love the warg scene -Every scene in Rohan was great, I can't say enough about the score and awesome actng by Theoden, Eomer, Aragorn, and Gandalf -LOVE the cliff hanger ending and the closing credits music -The EE adds SO MUCH to this movie...every extra scene works for me -this movie has GREAT comic relief (Eowyn's stew comes to mind, and everything out of Gimli's mouth)\n\nI think I'll watch it again tonight"

I can [barely] accept the whole 'Arwen as Frodo's saviour' from The Fellowship Of The Ring, but what Jackson has done this time made me feel nauseous - I actually felt the desire to vomit while watching this movie. The movie started and seemed to rush forward without any sense of coherency or sense of timing, and then they started on the action to blind the audience to the significant gaps in the plot. The action was good, but the gaps in the plot made it hard to follow. This WAS 3 hours of my life I will never be able to get back."

Remember when you read the books I mean it was your story it was your vision it was your world. Now there's someone stepping in here and telling you it's different from what you thought it was. Well of course it's not gonna work. I think Peter Jackson has created a film that reflects a book as good as possible, especially an epic story like TLOTR, which at one point can be looked at as a mythology of England. So do the Nibelungenlied or homer's Odyssey with an equal amount of success. I don't think so! It is art and not everybody is an artist.

Those scenes of Aragorn dreaming of Arwen or utterances that may appear good in script but sound stupid on the screen (running heavy breathing Legolas speaks to himself: red sun rises, blood has been spilt this night) have pretty much harmed this otherwise good film into something that one can't watch without a very unpleasant shivering sensation down one's spine. Fortunately, there are still more good parts than those bad ones, so this is more or less a fine movie. Hope that the Return of the King ends up better."

The plot of the movie is interesting and their characters are really complex. Besides, the special effects of the movie are unbelievable, specially in the battles. In my opinion, the best actor of the movie was Sir Ian McKellen, who played Gandalf the Wizard. The soundtrack of the film was also great, especially the one that is used in the Kingdom of Rohan. In conclusion, this movie really made me change my opinion about The Lord of the Rings Trilogy and made me a fan."

There was no need for instance for poor Theoden to be mentally substituted by Saruman himself (does that mean Saruman could multitask?). A mere plot by his treacherous consultant, finally exposed by Gandalf would do (as in the book). What about this semi romantic and semi metaphysic scene with the elven woman? How does it stick to the plot and what's the relevance with book 2? Nor was it necessary for Gimli and Aragon to anihilate hundreds of orcs, just on their own. And where was that huron tree intervention to save the Helm's Deep? Frankly, I had this feeling I was watching a set of visually impressive video clips, due to the very loose plotline. And that can get tiresome after an hour. Especially since I was waiting for much more.\n\nIn a nutshell, visual effects got better, film got worse (Gandalf looks much worse too).\n\nI wonder why second sequels are often worse. Let us hope third gets better."

Characters are maintained and strengthened, The plotting does well not to be too dreadful without inserting lightheartedness or breathtaking action, and the special effects absolutely blew me out of the water.\n\nTo all the Star Wars fans out there, take a look at Gollum, and see Yoda could only hope to be. Gollum is so life like and well portrayed.\n\nAll in all a great movie, albiet with some minor flaws,... very minor."

The beginning and the first 40 minutes tend to drag a bit, but then, when the Treebeard appears, it never gets dull. The bloody duel between Saruman and Theoden is the central part here, and again, we witness the visible sufferings of Frodo and Sam on their deadly mission. Well, then there is a huge, really breathtaking Helm's End battle. This siege is probably the best I ever saw or maybe will ever see. The tension is huge, and when the noble Elves die you want to cry, so sweet, so light, so sacred they seem there, among the ruins, blood, smoke and death. Aragorn, Grima, Pippin and Merry, Eowin and Eomer all appear and they all are so real, so flesh and blood that again, no doubt ever dwells in you that there might be a moment that they never existed. The scene of Isengard ruin is so grand that may overshadow many others, especially when the river starts to flow and crash the evil fortress away. It is a pity that some things were omitted in the film, but then, even 3 hours could not get all Tolkien created. Big respect goes to Mr. Lee for his absolutely precise portrayal of evil Saruman The White."

For people that have not read the book the viewing can be a very challenging task that demands careful attention and repeated viewings. I personally found it hard to remember the characters names, the places, and even to figure out which hobbit is which, or even which wizard is which. I also found it hard to understand the thick \"Middle Earth\" accent. Why does everyone's name sound the same? Sadly, I don't think that this movie can be enjoyed if you were just a casual fan who saw the first film a year ago. In order to fully understand this film, it is necessary to watch perhaps 2 or 3 times or with the captions on, and have a ring guru nearby so you can ask lots of questions. \"Who's that? What did he just say?\" There is simply too much going on for our ADD/ADHD society to engulf, or even me and I consider myself an intelligent college educated person. However, after working really hard, I eventually did understand and appreciate this as a spectacular film and story. I just don't think it classifies so much as a movie - it really is in its own category. A movie you should be able to go to without knowing anything about it, sit down and let the movie take you to its world and let you leave 2- 2.5 hours later with some token impact. A movie should be able to give you all you need such that you can take whatever you need from it in one sitting. The ring \"films\" don't do that with me. That is my caution."

Also, the performances are spectacular, especially coming from motion capture actor Andy Serkis, who truly serves as a scene stealer.

        "review_detailed_main": "In my review of 'The Chamber of Secrets' I mentioned how tough the job of Chris Columbus, director of the Harry Potter movies was. However when it comes to adapting books to film his job looks straightforward compared to Peter Jackson's. Over a thousand pages of novel had to be trimmed and shaped into six hours of film, perhaps two dozen important characters to bring to life, millions of devoted Tolkien fans and also the general filmgoing public to satisfy. I thought he did an amazing job with 'The Fellowship of the Ring', which was, aside from a few overwrought moments, probably as good an adaption as could possibly have been made. Unfortunately I can not say the same for 'The Two Towers'.\n\nOh, it is very good - Jackson again shows what a master he is at staging battle scenes and creating moments of wonder and horror, the special effects and New Zealand scenery are breathtaking and the quality cast again do a good job. But there are moments that are a bit corny and scenes that could have been more tense and exciting than they were.\n\nThe story consists of three seperate plot lines - Merry and Pippin journey into Fangorn Forest where they meet the Ents, the ancient Shepherds of the Trees, Frodo and Sam head closer to Mordor with Gollum, the twisted former possessor of the One Ring, and the remaining members of the Fellowship fight to save the kingdom of Rohan from the forces of Saruman, who has used magic and a treacherous advisor to enfeeble Theoden, Rohan's king.\n\nWhile it is packed with characters and events, there is not as much in 'The Two Towers' as there was in 'Fellowship', so while it does not have quite the variety of locations events that the first film did, Jackson has been able to create a film that is not as episodic this time (which was inevitable with the theatrical version of 'Fellowship' - see the extended DVD version for a longer, better-paced cut). The three-pronged story is still which was the screenwriters and editors biggest problem, as they had to try and juggle and balance the plots so that the viewer follows what is going on while the movie's momentum is maintained. Generally I think Jackson and company did a fine job but, especially towards the end of the movie, they could have done a better one. The film cuts between the climaxes of all three plots which reduces the power of each of them, especially the epic battle of Helm's Deep. The battle is a huge, superbly choreographed sequence but the tension that it creates gets released too often as we shift to what Sam and Frodo or Merry and Pippin are doing. I think it would have been better to finish Sam and Frodo's story, except for the epilogue with Gollum, which belongs at the end, before cutting between the battle at Helm's Deep and the hobbits' dealings with the Ents.\n\nPartly to provide a climax, a lot has been changed from the book. Many things that were in 'The Two Towers' will now be in the third movie (which makes me wonder how they will fit everything into 'The Return of the King') and a few things have been added. Some of the additions, such as the battle with the warg-riders and the Black Rider's sweep over the Dead Marshes, are very good. Others, such as Aragorn's near-death experience and his triumphant return, the slow-motion fall of Haldir and the reunion of a mother with her children are cliched. The screenplay is a flawed one: it does not always explain what is going on adequately and there are a disappointing number of melodramatic moments. I could have done with less shots of frightened women and children, less inspirational speeches, less beams of shining light and, though he was funny, less of Gimli the dwarf as comic relief. Sometimes, as at Helm's Deep, the atmosphere should be grim and frightening and a joke spoils the mood. As do a few cute, anachronistic moments such as when Legolas skates down stairs on a shield or when Sam talks about what it would be like to be a character in a great story. 'The Lord of the Rings' is not supposed to be postmodern - such moments just take you out of the alternative world that the movie is trying to create by reminding you that it is a movie.\n\nBut while it is not up to the very high standard of 'Fellowship', 'The Two Towers' is still a quality movie: spectacular, sometimes stirring and gorgious to look at and listen to. There is one other thing that would make it worth seeing: Gollum. The first CGI character to actually act well, Gollum, with his split personality, creepy voice and pale, veiny, superbly rendered body, is fascinating to watch. All his scenes are among the movie's best. If 'The Two Towers' does get an Oscar nomination for acting Andy Serkis, who did the voice and the movements that Gollum was based on, will probably be the one. I suspect though that this won't be the year that Peter Jackson gets to go up for Best Director or Best Film. Oh well, there's still 'The Return of the King.'\n\n7 1/2 / 10"

        "review_detailed_main": "This film isn't just missing small parts of the story; it's missing five plus chapters!!!\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring pleased me in that apart from small pieces it stayed, true to the original book. It was, I thought badly directed. I say this because I believe Jackson is at heart a producer. His organizational skills are amazing that at least is evident from the sheer amount of info LOTR holds within its pages. But he has no visual imagination whatsoever. Fellowship and The Two Towers are badly shot and badly edited. To put it in short I think Jackson is a second rate director who only got these films through blind enthusiasm, rather than ethical ability or quality of work.\n\nThe two Towers is an insult to everything Tolkien wrote, Peter Jackson for some unexplained reason has gone from following the book of FOTR pretty well to just doing what he wants in TTT. The first half of the film is more or less true to the book and I was enjoying it. Gollum especially, but about half way through just after King Theoden and his people left for Helms deep in anticipation of the attack of Sarumans army, THE STORY WENT OFF THE RAILS LIKE A SPEEDING TRAIN!!!!!!!!!!!! With Aragorn falling over the cliff after the fight with the Wolf riding Orcs (WHICH WASN'T IN THE BOOK) as if that wasn't laughable enough, then the plot goes off into a dreamland about Aragorn and Aowhen's (sorry if her names wrong:) love affair and the choices they must make for the greater good. Well nice try in giving the story more depth BUT STICK TO THE BOOK!!!!!!\n\nI don't know about any of you but I went to see J.R.R Tolkiens The Lord of The Rings, not Peter Jacksons Lord of the Rings. Ok it's still an adaptation, but FOTR was more or less the same as the book, why ON EARTH insult Tolkein's fans and Tolkien himself by taking one of the greatest works of fiction ever and changing it in any way you want. I think it was an attempt to fool everyone who haven't got the sense to read the books and make more cash on the side.\n\nTHERE'RE AT LEAST FIVE CHAPTERS MISSING AT THE END OF THIS FILM. Now the people who I was chatting to today about it said well you cant have it all in the film it would be about 9 hours long. GRRRRRR! I said the annoying thing is if Jackson had left out all the rubbish he made up and put in the parts of the story, which should be there, YOU COULD HAVE FITTED IT ALL IN. I am of course referring to Shelob the great spider, which bites Frodo and then Sam takes on the Ring himself and the bookends on a cliff-hanger. He's chucked that out and put it in the next film, The Return of the King, which is already the longest book anyway, without putting huge chunks of story in from the other films.\n\nIf you ask me Jackson has quiet literally lost the plot and in some style, instead of creating a realistic and accurate film on Tolkein's book he's done what he wants with it and I'm sorry but I think he should be slapped for even having the nerve!!!!!\n\nThe only people who will totally enjoy this film are the ones who haven't read the books AND SADLY THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM.\n\nBUT I'M DREADING WHAT HE'S GONNA CUT OUT AND EVEN MORE SO WHAT HE INVENTS TO STUFF INTO THE NEXT ONE....A YEAR OF DREAD IS AHEAD"

Yes Peter got money, but the work he did for it ... not sure if he has health issues because of all the planning and work he had to do for the Tolkien universe he created ... but he did a really good job to say the least.\n\nThis begins where the first movie left off - and the group will have more adventures, but also has to go different paths - to cover more ground (no pun intended), but also have different stories and people to meet. In the extended edition I watched (actually rewatched because I had seen the theatrical and the longer cut back in the day), you can see even more stuff - and new characters ... well new in the sense that in some cases you get a character that otherwise only pops up in the third movie. But the whole thing makes more sense that way.\n\nIf you listen to the old commentaries (which are fun and plenty), they do talk about DVDs - if you are baffled: they are discs that look like Blu Rays or 4K discs ... but had way less capacity on them ... also a weaker overall image and sound. But while that part may not have aged well - the movie itself has aged well - it really looks good to say the least. And if you are into Fantasy movies ... well the only thing that remains to be answered: you want to read the books first if you haven't or dive into this? Of course then there is also the new Prime show - which I will dive into sometime in the future."

I watched Elijah Wood's strugle with his one expression and attept at Homersexual flirting with Sean Astin, the miscast fat American. The dialogue sounded like it was being excreted. The dwarf is now just comic relief in the tradition of jar jar binks. I had to shut my eyes every time Peter thrust the camera in Aragorn's face. Golumn was horribly unrealistic. Puppets look light years better when used properly. I want to believe what I see. The line to the effect of \"I hope someday someone will write a book about us\" had me cowering under my seat in embarrassment. The battle scenes tried to be too flashy and as a result you can't get a scope of the battle or see what's going on. The fact that its rating is almost nine says almost too much about todays generation (to which I am also part of). LOTR above Citizen Kane? come on! It is just Blockbuster drivel from the Hollywood machine. You can only take this film on face value, there is no depth. I say go back to Braindead."

The moment the rain falls over the hushed armies in the last minutes before the conflict erupts is one of the most powerful scenes I have seen in a war epic. The overwhelming hopelessness of the remnant of Rohan as they attempt to survive the endless enemy hordes is incredibly powerful, and the tension is tangible. Despite knowing a third movie comes next, it felts as if anything could happen. LOTR: The Two Towers edges out the rest of the trilogy by avoiding the weight of beginning or ending a greater story and can be present in the intensity of its own journey."

The action sequences still looks spectacular even in 2024. And sure, some of the Gollum effects does not look as it was cutting edge 22 years ago, the performance by legendary Andy Serkis more then carries it.

As near-perfect as a film can possibly get, no longer comparable to other genre pictures, but to the great classics of the art.\n\nThe sheer scope of The Two Towers makes its predecessor look like an idle stroll in the park. It starts with a bang and doesn't quit for the whole three hours of its duration. And like in the first part, Jackson doesn't fall victim to all the eye candy (and there's more than plenty), he injects the endeavour with a sense of humanity and gravitas that transcends fantasy film-making.\n\nPerhaps the greatest surprise is Gollum, a CGI creation that is guaranteed to make your jaw drop. Acted by Andy Serkis and replaced in the final version by a marvelous computer creation by Wetta Digital (surpassing all previous digital characters by miles), he delivers the best performance in the movie. Dynamic, incredibly expressive and ultimately conveying a sense of real pity for the character. And that's no small achievement in a film filled with actors of this calibre.\n\nIt all concludes with what is probably the best medieval battle scene ever shown and will leave you with a hunger for more.\n\nThe Two Towers is what film's all about. A true masterpiece. And we still have one more film before the trilogy is completed."

I love this film, so what if Peter Jackson doesnt have every inch of Tolkiens book down because he's got most of it, and he expands into areas which i personally felt were missing or bunged off into the appendicies, and i cant see what all the uproar is about. Remember people its a film, a film of a long book, which i can honestly say is not without fault in itself. Some areas would translate very difficultly onto film. The Portrayal of Faramir disappointed me a bit, because i liked his character of a noble man in the book, but his greed and power lust is there to show that men are not without fault, and he comes good in the end. The battle scene with the Wargs is a very nice addition, and Legolas does that cool thing on the horse. Shelob will turn up, stop writing threatening letters to Peter Jackson, give the poor guy a break, he's dedicated years of his life to these films and he's done a superb job so far. Now its another year of post production!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I have to admit, I'm completely won over by the masterful work director Peter Jackson has done with Tolkien's \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy. I'm not particularly a fan of George Lucas' \"Star Wars\" movies and thought the \"Star Trek\" films to be inconsistent, so fantasy isn't exactly my thing. But after watching \"Fellowship of the Ring\" and \"The Two Towers\" back to back the past few nights, I'm absolutely stunned by the magnitude of the achievement here.\n\nThis film picks up right where the first installment left off, with the fellowship having dissolved. Frodo leaves with Sam as company so that he may take the ring to Mordor and destroy it in the fire from which it was created. The others leave to fight the battle for Middle Earth as Saruman has unleashed his army from Isengard.\n\nThe battle scenes between the men of Rohan and their elf allies against the urik-hai, the half men, half orc creatures bred by Saruman, are amazing. Digital technology plays a major part in these scenes, but as mentioned in a previous review, it is so seamless with the real cinematography that the result is just stunning.\n\nGollum, a digitally created image, plays a major part in this installment. He's one of the classic characters in Tolkien's work, and I wondered how they could possibly portray him as I imagined, but the result is perfect. The digital artists struck just the right balance between a prowling little creature attempting to regain the ring and a pitiful figure twisted by its power.\n\nLike the first movie in the trilogy, this one is long (three hours plus), but it's such an epic film and full of so many characters and so much detail, that you're sucked in anyways. At times, you're reminded of Shakespeare, and at other times one of those Disney cartoons from before the war, like \"Snow White.\"\n\nThese films are a wonderful creation and I hope everyone enjoys them as much as I have. \"The Return of the King\" should be awesome."

        "review_detailed_main": "In 1994, when Houghton Mifflin Company published a single copy of The Lord of The Rings, Douglas A. Anderson wrote a 'revised note to the text' making it clear that J. R. R. Tolkien's famous epic novel was 'often erroneously called a trilogy, when it is in fact a single novel, consisting of six books plus appendices, sometimes published in three volumes'. The three volumes Anderson referred to, The Fellowship of The Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of The King, were initially developed by the original publishers for purposes of cutting down on the cost of printing (David Colbert, The Magical Worlds of The Lord of The Rings). According to Colbert it was the publishers who first came up with the title The Two Towers for the second volume. Given his fascination with and penchant for referring to dozens of important towers within the novel, Tolkien himself wasn't sure which two towers were in fact denoted by the title and was therefore initially unconvinced by the title itself. However Tolkien eventually conceded and thus the myth of the trilogy of The Lord of The Rings was born.\n\nAll of this background is not for want when reviewing Peter Jackson's film version of The Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers. In spite of following the traditional lead of breaking the story up into three films, he has essentially remained faithful to the text, as faithful as any movie director can be expected to when trying to adapt such an epic to the big screen, by maintaining a continuous uninterrupted flow from the first film to the second. The Two Towers immediately picks up right where the Fellowship of The Ring leaves off and we are again treated to a movie masterpiece so entrancing and perfectly paced. The Two Towers is filled with rich three-dimensional characters and plotlines, beautiful performances, and numerous battle scenes amidst breathtaking landscapes. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue in their quest to bring the one ring to Mordor and destroy it in the very fires from which it was forged, while the rest of the fellowship is split up into several factions in an effort to find their lost friends and take up the fight against the armies of the Dark Lord Sauron and the traitorous Saruman. New characters are introduced, notably the Ents, Grima Wormtongue, King Theodon and the creature Gollum.\n\nThe film is undoubtedly mythical, just as Tolkien had intended, but it also more than adequately explores many of the difficult problems and questions Tolkien had examined during his lifetime; the inevitable encroachment of industrialization, and its impact on modern human society; the quest by some for unfettered power over all races; the onslaught of war in order to both provoke and quell that quest; the longing by others for peace and pastoral tranquility; and the endless forging and breaking up of alliances between the different races to achieve or defeat these varying quests. In many ways Gollum's character is a microcosm of these competing interests, providing much of the film's most vivid and provocative moments and leaving the audience with much to ponder.\n\nIt is perhaps to their considerable credit and understanding of today's moviegoers that Jackson and his collaborators did not make one nine hour film but don't be surprised when the movie ends and the credits roll if instead you don't find yourself wishing they had."

In the movie, Faramir is as bad as Boromir and wants the ring for Gondor. Arrrrrgh! Letting Frodo go shows that even though a man can be tempted, he can overcome. The movie eventually got it right, but only after Faramir took Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath. What a crock!\n\nThe scene with Saruman's orcs riding the cats (or whatever they were) had no business being in the movie. The screenwriters could've used the time to show more of Merry, Pippin and Treebeard, but they just glossed over this very important part.\n\nAlso, what's this crap with the almost love triangle among Arwen, Aragorn and Elrond? Yuck! If I'd wanted a chick flick, I wouldn't have gone to see The Two Towers.\n\nI saw \"Fellowship\" several times in the theatre, but \"The Two Towers\" was a dud. I'll wait for it on DVD."

But this... this....! To begin with, this should have had a disclaimer that the film was \"Inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien's the Two Towers,\" so that geeks such as myself could've saved the $10.00 that I'll never see again, and preserved a fond childhood memory of spending time discovering a literary masterpiece. I thought I had been scarred by the first film's brilliant dialogue, e.g.,\"Let's hunt some Orc!\" (And many people who apparently love this film think George Lucas writes clunky lines!) but this entire installment left me wanting to pluck out my eyes in a vain effort to cleanse myself. Of course I see the need to condense a long novel to run within an alloted time, but that's not what happened here, they apparently felt that they could improve upon something that was already nearly perfect. That was mistake number one. Mistake number two was devoting a good portion of the film to Liv Tyler, for reasons unkown to me, since nowhere does her character appear in the book. Other gripes: Turning the land of Rohan into a shanty hippie commune. Then feeling the need to show some hippie kids fleeing, in order to stir up some sympathy in the audience, is my only guess. Suddenly finding myself in the middle wondering if the movie had stopped, and I was now watching a New Age music video (see Liv Tyler above), Enya, Enigma, something like that. Half expecting Gandalf to turn into Max Von Sydow when King Theoden is \"possessed\" by Saruman, and begin bellowing, \"The power of Christ compels you!\" Aragorn dying, to be healed by Arwen (more Liv Tyler), and then awakened when the horsey starts kissing him. Then there's the time that... Ugh! I give up! It's a shame too, because I've really liked Peter Jackson's work before this. I just can't fathom his need to turn Tolkien's work into his own. Sheesh, even Kubrick wasn't this bad!"

        "review_detailed_main": "IMDb Top 250: 30 The Lord of the Rings: the Two Towers continues the epic story that began in Fellowship of the Ring. We meet new characters, develop others, and see epic battles.\n\nThere is such a phenomenon in film called 'Middle film syndrome' or something of the sort. It means that in a trilogy, the middle film is the weakest because it isn't exposition like the first film, or conclusion like the third. The Two Towers is a perfect example of this concept. The awe of Fellowship isn't present, and the finish of Return of the King doesn't happen, leaving... the middle.\n\nI'm not trying to say Two Towers is a bad film. But compared to the other Lord of the Rings films, it is. They're AAA, Towers is AA. The characters introduced, like the King and nephew in Rohan, are thrown into the story without a reasonable introduction. The battle for Helm's Deep isn't that spectacular. Humour is misplaced. Even the films colour is wrong. Some of these factors can't really be fixed, because of the books, but some of them should've been dealt with.\n\nThere are still some great parts of Two Towers. Gollum is nuts, batty and crazy. His presence helps Frodo and Sam's scenes, which don't actually go anywhere. The Dead Marshes are creepy. Ringwraiths return- on new mounts. And the tree battle, the only epic scene in the movie.\n\nMost of my problems with Two Towers are that the scale is diminished, no scenes other than the battle at Isengard leave the viewer in awe. The battle for Helm's Deep was also... not great. The sides weren't even close to being reasonable, making the result unbelievable. The colouring of the last battle made it seem very dark and bleak, but Gimli became a walking joke and Legolas rode a shield/surfboard. Clashing themes. The orcs didn't have anything special in that battle to make the battle interesting. In a series with groundbreaking battles, Two Towers came up short.\n\nThe Two Towers is a good film, but a mediocre Lord of the Rings film. If for some reason you see it before the other two, the others are far better. Not much else I can say, you're either in it for all 3 or not in it. Fear not, Return of the King is the strongest, a worthy finish of your time. 8.3/10"

The Two Towers shows us that he is not a one-hit wonder, like so many directors are. I actually think that The Two Towers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring, and sometimes even surpasses it.\n\nThis film is the biggest film in the trilogy. What do I mean by that? Well this film has so many things going like the amazing Battle of Helms Deep. Frodo and Sam journey to Mount Doom, to destroy the Ring. But the one who's leading them through the way is Gollum, he looks so creepy and realistic, that he doesn't feel disconnected from us. A powerful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum, he should of been nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nThe Best part of the film, is quite easily and everyone knows it the ending. The ending of the battle of Helm's Deep is quite breathtaking, and as Gandalf the White comes in the distance with another army to defeat the Orcs. When Treebeard and his army of Entz tear down Isengard, the destruction and the battle is so immense in size, that you truly have to see to believe."

Elijah Wood was absolutely superb, along with Sean Astin, Ian Mckellen, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, John Rhys Davis and Dominic Monaghan. They were all absolutely excellent, start to finish. They are like the books in so many ways and really managed to take the books and put it onto a screen in such a wonderful way. The storyline was very strong and advanced. The way the turned Andy Circus into Gollum was epic for something that came out at that time. It, by far, had the best battle scene in the whole franchise and better than the majority of films I've seen. Those who've seen the film will know which battle I'm talking about but I don't want to give spoilers. I've lost count of how many times I've seen these films. The dialogue was awesome and there wasn't a scene where I spotted a huge mistake that ruined the film. I think there was the odd CGI error but it wasn't major. The make up was extremely believable, especially the orcs and the hobbits' feet. The whole world was just so great. Overall, this was my least favourite out of the three but it is very close. Peter Jackson did a great job and I have no idea how many times I've rewatched these films! I hope the Amazon Series is going to be really good but I don't think it's even remotely possible to live up to these standards."

The star is now clearly Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), and the hobbits spend much of the movie away from the action. The last third of the movie is dominated by an epic battle scene that would no doubt startle the gentle medievalist J.R.R. Tolkien. The task of the critic is to decide whether this shift damages the movie. It does not. \"The Two Towers\" is one of the most spectacular swashbucklers ever made, and, given current audience tastes in violence, may well be more popular than the first installment, \"The Fellowship of the Ring.\" It is not faithful to the spirit of Tolkien and misplaces much of the charm and whimsy of the books, but it stands on its own as a visionary thriller. I complained in my review of the first film that the hobbits had been short-changed, but with this second film I must accept that as a given, and go on from there."

The acting in Two Towers is top notch, as it was to be expected. But the true stand out wasn't who you would have expected, it was Gollum. If ever a CGI character deserved an Academy award or at least a nomination, it is Gollum. The CGI is so beleivable its creepy and the acting really lets you see whats going on inside of his head. This was a difficult job you could tell but Serkis pulled it off with style. The action will keep you begging for more as Jackson never ceases to amaze you with what he can do with the camera. So go now, stop reading and then wait a year until you can watch the extended edition in preparation for Return of the King"

I've read the books and in their purest form would not make a good movie. Taking 20 pages to describe the shape of a hedge doesn't make for an easy translation. A picture says a thousand words and the extended versions of the Trilogy provide ample satisfactory elements of the story. Again it looks amazing and the sound track is outstanding. Simply unforgettable and enormously revisitable. Superb. 10 easily."

Admittedly, I kind of enjoyed it because it is visually the most amazing thing we've seen on the screen yet, especially the computer generated character with the big ears (Grogglegorf, I think). All the names sound alike, most of the characters look alike, and there are too many of them to care about any of them. The scene with the H.R. Puffenstuff trees was mildly humorous, although I don't think that was intentional. So the plot is probably even less penetrable to non-geeks than the first one, but it is oh so fun to watch. If you are not a sci-fi geek, go for the visuals. Computer graphics have reached the promised land -- it is a landmark movie in that regard. Just don't expect to be included in this little Star Trek Convention of a movie unless you've read the books."

I have never read the books but was informed that the 'Two Towers' would be even better than it's predecessor as the plot thickens and action really gets going. However, on leaving the cinema after watching this film I was left somewhat disappointed.\n\nI have read review after review saying this is peoples favourite film. I mean come on, be serious. It takes an age to get going and if it was not for the climactic battle of Helm's Deep would have been the worst excuse for a 3 hour long film since the first two hours of Titanic. Even in this ground breaking climax it is constantly interrupted by Treebeard, the character that personifies the slowness of the rest of the film. Also the attempted romance between Viggo Mortenson and Liv Tyler's characters seems just to be in this film because Liv complained of lack of screen time because there certainly doesn't seem any need for her character in this instalment apart from this pointless sub-plot.\n\nThe creation of Gollum was simply brilliant and deserved the Oscar but I was pleased to see this film ignored in the other categories. One thing is for sure, I will not look forward to the next sequel as much as I did this one, following this film's disappointment."

        "review_detailed_main": "At the outset, Peter Jackson and company has done an incredible job of bringing Tolkien's vision to the screen. I first read The Lord of the Rings almost 30 years ago, and I felt the books were unfilmable with the then current technology. Even with today's state-of-the-art CGI, I still felt that the LOTR could not be filmed properly, unless the people making the film had a great understanding and love for the source material. It is obvious from watching the films that Peter Jackson, et al, has a great awareness and compassion for Tolkien's work.\n\nI realize the immense differences between the two mediums of the written page and films and the challenges adapting one from the other. So I accepted the changes in the movies weighed against the books without much grievance, i.e.: Tom Bombadil's absence; Faramir's personality change; Frodo & Sam in Osgiliath; the presence of the elves at Helm's Deep; Arwen's expanded presence; even the silliness of Gimli's character, etc.\n\nBut there is one element of the movies that disturbs me. It's the films treatment of the `ring' itself. This is where I get to be a LOTR geek, so bear with me! In the books, Sauron never had a psychic connection with the ring as it's portrayed in the films, so he's never certain who the ringbearer is. Frodo never sees the `eye' when he puts on the ring, and vice versa. This is a major plot device in the books, especially in The Return of the King, where Aragorn is in possession of Saruman's palantiri, and deliberately uses it to allow Sauron to track Aragorn's whereabouts and thereby deceiving Sauron into thinking he had the ring. In so doing, Sauron's attention was averted from Mordor where Frodo and Sam were able to enter virtually undetected.\n\nThus far in the films, Sauron knows exactly who and where the ringbearer is, and that makes it impossible for the ringbearer to enter Mordor unnoticed. I see this as the one major flaw in Peter Jackson's visualization of LOTR and I hope this problem is resolved in The Return of the King."

The script moves the established characters along their journey, introduces more characters and stages some very spectacular events. To do this it splits into a number of directions as it follows different groups through various paths and obstacles. Some scenes put the foundations in place for what is to come in the next movie, whilst most of it leads towards the centre piece of this movie, the Battle of Helms Deep. This unfolds at a relatively uneven pace, but all scenes are technically well made.\n\nIf you compare the battle to the various spectacles of the modern era such as those in Game of Thrones it feels pretty standard, but at the time of its release it was groundbreaking in terms of the scale of the set-piece and use of CGI. A huge theme in the trilogy is hope in the face of despair and the battle portrays it with some wonderful sequences. The arrival of the elves, King Theoden riding out to meet the Orcs, and THAT moment when sun rises still makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up.\n\nIs there too much CGI? Yes, I think there is. As epic as it makes the battle look, it is distracting when you know most of those vast Orcs legions were generated by computer programmers. That being said, a major success of the movie is it's CGI depiction of the character Gollum by the animators and the work of performance-capture star Andy Serkis. This character is central to the depiction of how the ring corrupts the souls of those who possess or seek to possess it and his scenes are some of the best in the trilogy.\n\nGenerally the visuals are phenomenally good. The cinematography, lighting, colours, editing, locations, set design, costuming, makeup, props, and general art design are some of the most iconic in movie history. For me the visual spectacle is so powerful it actually detracts my attention from the characters, who are good, but sometimes feel they have come along for the ride.\n\nIt is a movie that could have been perfect if the characters were better and there were performances that (aside from Serkis) were truly iconic.\n\nSaying that there are lots of solid performances, with the best for me being Bernard Hill, Brad Douriff, Ian McKellen, Sean Astin, and David Wenham. Nobody feels less than adequate for the role. However, I get the feeling that the focus was so much on the animation and the general look and feel that Peter Jackson might have been satisfied with not capturing that many truly memorable character moments.\n\nFor me it's an 8.5/10 but I round upwards."

It captures the immense detail of the book. That is why it is so grand. Tolkien's story was put together so that if it is changed, it losses its meaning. The cast and crew realized that, causing then to put in the most minute details. Of course, some things had to be changed. There are some things in books that don't work for movies. The most major mistake, that I find, is the Fact that the movie does not end when then book ends. The line in the book is, \"Frodo was alive but taken by the Enemy.\" In the movie, it only foreshadows that specific line with the line, \"she will do it.\" But, I understand that in movies, time is limited; and time was sparse at the time. If the movie continued, it would cause the audience to become bored. Other than that, no movie has surpassed it- for me anyway. I also find that there are hidden truths behind Lord of the Rings. I find it through my studies of Tolkien. That is what made it special; that is what made it never to be surpassed by any other book. It is a book that has become a movie that will stand for generation as one of the greatest stories of ALL TIME."

The characters were boring, the dialogue unremarkable, and the plot -- well, what plot? Mostly it consisted of people running from one spot to another, badly in need of showers and shampoo. My concern isn't with what they left out, it's with what they put in! A lot of herky jerky camera shots of impossible to follow battle scenes and boring scenes with boring characters. I spent most of the movie asking my poor husband what time it was. We would've walked out, but thought the couple we were with wanted to stay, and they thought we wanted to stay, so instead all four of us ended us wasting three hours -- a total of 12 -- and $32.!

Of course, having read the book several times, I know how it will end, but I'm very curious how Peter Jackson will adapt it to the screen. Judging by this second installment I imagine it will also be grand in every aspect. Watching TTT was an amazing experience with many highlights. First of all there is of course the creature Gollum, which is 'made' absolutely astonishing. Other highlights include the battle at Helms Deep as well as the fight between Gandalf the Grey and the Balrog. For the comic-relief this movie relies on excellent one-liners from Gimli. There are however also some parts that worked less for me. Personally I was not fond of the side-plot with Treebeard in the book and I don't care for it much in the movie. However, it is essential to the story, so who am I to complain. What I also did not enjoy was talking orcs (can't remember them as being whiners...) and can somebody explain to me what the deal is with the immortality of Elves?\n\nAll these little things aside, Peter Jackson created another masterpiece in which we follow the trail of three separate groups in their quest against Mordor and survival of Mankind and Middle Earth. Jackson deemed it unnecessary to recap the stories from the first movie. Rightfully so, I would say, because if you have not seen The Fellowship there is no real point in watching The Two Towers. There is some reference to some loose ends The Fellowship left (what happened to Gandalf, who is Gollum etc), but never too much. Anybody who enjoyed the Fellowship will also enjoy The Two Towers. The movie did not feel like three hours and leaves the audience craving for more. And that is good news. I wonder how long people will let the cliffhanger be unsolved. Therefor there is a kind request to everybody who already knows how the book ends: don't talk about it in public, because some people don't want to know yet... Bring on 'Return of the King'!"

The overall effect is that the story moves much better and the story is easier to follow. Even though the movie is longer, the pacing is quicker and doesn't seem to drag as much as the original. Likewise, the additional footage both improves the characterization of the newly introduced characters and restores some plot threads so that other existing scenes now make more sense (like the horse finding Aragorn). It's also easier to tell who is who because many of the newer characters names are now spoken more often.\n\nSo, just like with the \"Fellowship\" DVD, the extended version is really the only version worth owning.

The question then commonly asked becomes, \"Does this movie deserve to be remembered that long?\"\n\nThe answer to that question is, really \"deserved\" is the wrong word.Independence Day will probably still be watched 30 years from now, not because it is necessarily all that good, but because it was hugely successful and spawned a slew of disaster-related flicks. In other words, it defined an era. And with the Harry Potter series being developed as we speak, and both the Chronicles of Narnia and His Dark Materials being made into franchises, one can easily conclude that this film will be remembered as the film that spawned the development of modern fantasy blockbusters (although the Harry Potter series being contemporary was coincidental). By now, we have come to expect that lesser films will occasionally become classics, while greater films will occasionally fall into obscurity.\n\nHowever, I feel, and I hope you will concurr when you see it for yourself, that this is a worthy addition to those era-defining films that come along every-so-often. In fact, IMHO, this is one of the best era-defining films since Star Wars, or at least one of the most enjoyable. Several things from this franchise are truly, justifiably, memorable, such as the wholesome innocence of the Shire and the hobbits, gandalf's stand against the balrog, the preparation for the climactic battle of helms deep, the double personality of Gollum, and...well, since this review is being written in August of 2002 and the Return of the King is not out yet, I'll leave this last one blank, but I am confident that this last film will give us something that will make it worth remembering, perhaps even more than the first two. Some say that the oscar should and will go to this last film, but I say that the oscar has had mixed reactions to these era-defining franchises (the only film I would classify as an era-defining franchise that garnered an oscar since the 70s was Silence of the Lambs), and the Academy might be better off bestowing the award on another film that will fall into obscurity if not honored, rather than adding garnish to an already classic series.\n\nI never garauntee that everyone will like a film. If you go to the Casablanca (my personal all-time favorite) page on this website and check the rating stats, you'll find that more than a few people have given it a \"1\" rating. But most probably will find this film at least a highly enjoyable diversion, and that is what film is all about in the first place.\n\n9/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, I must say that \"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\" was significantly more easy to sit through than \"The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring\", as this movie had more action, and wasn't as slow-paced with as much storytelling and setting the mood as the first movie did.\n\nNeedless to say that you need to watch the first movie prior to watching this 2002 sequel, unless you want to be missing out on a great deal of information about the characters and the storyline.\n\nAs a direct continuation of the previous movie \"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\" was a nice upscale in pace, and I must admit that I was enjoying this a lot more than the previous movie.\n\nWhile \"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\" is driven by a solid story and character development, much like the first movie, then \"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\" adds a much needed element of action and fantasy battles.\n\nIt shouldn't be necessary to say that you are in for a grand adventure when you sit down to watch \"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\", especially if you are a fan of the sword and sorcery fantasy genre, which I happen to be.\n\nAnd it was marvelous to have the original cast return to perform their roles again, making for a wonderful continuation of the storyline, and not having to adjust to a new face on an already established character.\n\nDefinitely well worth taking the time to sit down and watch the extended version. Just keep about 4 hours free for it. I am rating \"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\" a well-deserving seven out of ten stars."

        "review_title": "A new power is rising",
        "review_detailed_main": "A story generally consists of three acts; The first act is the beginning where you introduce your story & its characters. The second act is the middle part where the majority of the plot surfaces & character development takes place. And the third & final act is where you tie up all the loose ends & bring your entire tale to a satisfying conclusion. Before penning down these stories, almost every writer has a very clear conscience of how to begin & end their tales but the most troublesome part for each one of them is always the middle act. Because no matter how great the opening or closing part may be, if this vital act isn't handled well, the overall experience of the entire story will unfortunately amount to nothing. And that's true for whether you are writing a book or a play or a movie.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is that middle act of Peter Jackson's on-screen adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien's Middle-Earth saga. And because, just like the novel, The Lord of the Rings is meant to be viewed as a single film edited into three parts of which The Two Towers is the second part, there is no definite beginning or ending to this film. Plus, what's even more challenging this time is the fact that unlike the first film, which had a single plot to focus on, The Two Towers deals with multiple storylines & has to make each one work efficiently in order to accomplish its goal. Nevertheless, the great news is that even though The Two Towers doesn't follow the novel's story as faithfully as The Fellowship of the Ring did, it still succeeds as one rare sequel that improves upon the original and, just like its predecessor, is one of the greatest films of its genre.\n\nPicking up right from where The Fellowship of the Ring signed off, The Two Towers tells the aftermath of the breaking of the Fellowship & intercuts three storylines. The first plot line concerns Frodo & Sam, who are continuing their journey to Mordor to destroy the One Ring but soon their peril deepens as there is another who hunts the ring. The second plot line deals with Merry & Pippin, who were captured by Uruk-Hai in the last film but manage to escape, meet Treebeard the Ent & help to plan an attack on Isengard, where Saruman is breeding a massive army. The third plot line covers the trio of Aragorn, Legolas & Gimli who, while pursuing the flock of Uruk-Hai that took Merry & Pippin hostage, meet an unexpected ally and then make their way to Rohan where Saruman has King Theoden under his spell while an impending war looms upon those free lands. The title refers to the union between the two towers; Barad-d\u00fbr, fortress of the Dark Lord Sauron & Orthanc, stronghold of the wizard Saruman.\n\nThe direction by Peter Jackson doesn't lose any of its potency for this sequel as The Two Towers manages to live up to all hype & expectations, which was even more this time considering the massive critical & financial success of the first film. And not only it delivers everything it promised but also shows major improvements in almost all filmmaking departments. The three story lines are extremely well written & narrated and enough time is given to develop every single one of its new characters, without interrupting the development arc of any of the reprising cast. Also, the film smoothly switches from one plot to another without confusing its viewers and the decision to conclude this film at a different event from the novel makes sense for it sets a perfect stage for the finale. Narrating multiple stories within the same film is never an easy task but Peter Jackson has done it again & what's even more admirable is that he gave equal importance & value to all three storylines.\n\nComing to the technical aspects, all filmmaking departments get significant upgrades & are more fine-tuned this time. The production design continues to impress as the miniatures used to represent Rohan, Helm's Deep & Osgiliath are meticulously detailed down to the smallest of things, thus making art direction & set decoration a winning aspect, once again. Still, what makes these sets look even more appealing is their ideal fusion with the beautifully photographed landscapes of New Zealand. The cinematography immerses the viewers into Middle-Earth just like its predecessor, and the camerawork is at its absolute best when it comes to the film's action sequences. Make-up & Costume Design stay true to the timeline it depicts. Sound feels more authentic this time & is spot-on where it matters most. Editing trims the film down to 179 minutes & although it's very effective in that 3 hours of runtime, I recommend the extended version instead as it adds 45 minutes of new & extended scenes and further develops the film's characters, adds greater depth to its plot & enriches the overall experience of The Two Towers.\n\nWeta Digital made history with The Fellowship of the Ring when it brought alive Middle-Earth in breathtaking detail but the enhancements it brings in the visual effects of The Two Towers is even more groundbreaking. Gollum & Treebeard are entirely computer-generated & it was a VFX milestone of its time. But it's the Battle of Helm's Deep where the visuals are at its finest and without this team's creativity & breakthroughs, it wouldn't rank today as one of the greatest screen battles of all time. Another scene where visuals really shine, but doesn't get as much credit as it deserves, is the Flooding of Isengard sequence, which undeniably is one hell of an eye-opener you don't see in cinema very often. Finally, the background score by Howard Shore introduces new tracks for Rohan, Gollum & many more sequences while the music heard in the first chapter further develops & expands into new realms. Splendid where it is meant to be, touching where it needs to be & magnificently pleasing to the viewers' senses, the soundtrack of The Two Towers is an outstanding follow-up to its predecessor and continues to enhance the emotional journey of this exceptional adventure.\n\nAs far as the performances go, The Two Towers doesn't disappoint in this aspect & adds even more strength to its ensemble cast. The new cast is no let down but another right step in the right direction while the reprising cast continues to evolve with their respective characters. Everyone from Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin to Aragorn, Legolas & Gimli has a stronger sense of their characters in comparison to the last film. However, Ian McKellen, who plays Gandalf, gets a fresh makeover in this film & has a new dimension to explore. Amongst the new cast, making their presence felt are Bernard Hill as Th\u00e9oden; King of Rohan, Miranda Otto as \u00c9owyn; Th\u00e9oden's niece, David Wenham as Faramir; Boromir's younger brother, Brad Dourif as Gr\u00edma Wormtongue; Saruman's agent at Rohan, Karl Urban as \u00c9omer; Th\u00e9oden's nephew & John Rhys-Davies as voice of the Treebeard; Leader of the Ents. But the most notable amongst both the new & reprising cast turns out to be none other than Andy Serkis' rendition of Gollum / Sm\u00e9agol. Heartwarming & heartbreaking at the same time, Serkis' gives this CGI character its very own soul and delivers such an intense, energetic & show-stealing performance that it's impossible to not love as well as pity this wretched character. Easily the finest performance of the saga, so far.\n\nDirector Peter Jackson & his crew, in spite of deviating greatly from the film's source material, not only succeed in making the middle part of The Lord of the Rings a smooth continuation of The Fellowship of the Ring but also a worthy expansion & evolution of Middle-Earth. The artistic license taken by Jackson, Walsh & Boyens does alter the overall tone & style of the film but they still manage to keep everything very much within the realms of Tolkien's world & true to its spirits. Also, if one envisions this second chapter as an adaptation of the middle act of Tolkien's complete novel rather than conceiving it as an adaptation of only the second volume, then the writers' decisions start to make much more sense. And honestly, apart from few purists, most won't even mind this tweaking because, in spite of all the modifications, The Two Towers makes up for another successful, spellbinding & engrossing epic that effortlessly blends art & entertainment into a staggering masterpiece. On an overall scale, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is another landmark film of its genre that ably meets & exceeds the genre-defining standards set by its predecessor, breaks many filmmaking barriers of its genre with its revolutionary production and signs off as an extremely satisfying sequel which sets an even higher benchmark for the final chapter of Tolkien's legendarium."

Before seeing the second one I had my doubts, thinking it might be dull (it could be that I was used to the first one)\n\nIve seen THE TWO TOWERS and I just have to say WOW!!! This is 10 times better than the fellowship of the ring. The first one was all talk and little action. This one is all action and little talk.\n\nThe fellowship is broke- Sam and Frodo on their way to Mondor, meeting Gollum on the way who is fighting his poisoned mind (Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde thing going on with him.) Aragorn, Legolas, Gandalf and Gimli meet up with a kingdom of men who are about to be attacked by Saruman. Merry and Pippin have been captured and spend their time im a forest full of moving trees. Oh and Arwen and Aragorn's love is put on hold with Arwen being put to the test by her ftaher to show her loyalty to the elves.\n\nThis film is far more mature than the first film. You learn more about the creature Gollum and you get to like him and feel sorry for him. The ring is consuming Frodo by the second and god knows where he would be without Sam. (Andy Serkins should get an Oscar for his role!!) Merry and Pippin are more mature and Pippin shows a bit of intelligence.\n\nOh and Arwen and Aragorn's love is put on hold with Arwen being put to the test by her ftaher to show her loyalty to the elves. Aragorn fears he may not come back to his beloved and you see him having glances at the King's niece.\n\nAlthough the film is dark, there is some light humor, particularly from Gollum and Gimli. You'll be stitches over what Gollum says and does and what Gimli has to put up with- a dwarf in the company of tall men.\n\nOverall this deserves far more Oscar recognition that the first one (even though the first one was badly underrated in the Oscars). Prepare for a lot of gore and one cool stunt from Legolas on a shield.\n\n10/10!!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "TTT should be taken for what it is, a visually attractive, popcorn fun, crowd-pleaser. In this respect, the movie does it perfect. The action is well choreographed, and very interesting to watch. Peter Jackson is very good at this. He makes movies interesting. He makes movies fun to watch. This whole movie was a big story, with really no inner message. My mind did not go through any thought process this whole movie. I just sat in my cushioned seat, and absorbed the action/adventure fest this movie gave me. And as I said, this movie does that well.\n\nThe cinematography was amazing. You could tell that most of the time making movie was spent in a little room, on a computer, animating Golem, who felt like a real person. Also, considering most of the background and sets were made by computers, they did a great job with that.\n\nThe story also was very good, mainly because it is from what is considered one of the greatest books of all time.\n\nAlso, the movie is very eye-catching, and you can tell Peter threw in some things just to make sure you were watching (Legolos jumping onto his horse is a perfect example). This makes the movie feel like \"The Matrix\", which is something many directors trying to make an epic DO NOT want.\n\nThe love story could have been done without, as I forgot every part of the movie with that in it. I can't even remember who was in love with Liv Tyler. This felt like they were trying to add more meaning into the battle scenes with whoever she loved, but I could see no connection between the two.\n\nAlso the character development... wasn't their. Unless you consider Gandalf becoming \"White\", or Frodo becoming woozier, character development, i felt none in the movie.\n\nThere are many movies that I sit and wonder after, not because of I being confusing, because that is what the director wants you to do. The Pianist, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Chinatown, 2001, A Clockwork Orange and others all made me do this. After seeing this in theaters, I was right out of the theater, and discussing how \"cool\" the battle scenes were. Wow. Gripping.\n\nBut I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it. Throughout the whole movie, my eyes were fixed on the screen. I mean, almost any male, despite how \"inner\" they say they are, can't resist 25 minute battle scenes with fire and ogres.\n\nBut this movie was easily forgotten in the thoughtful part of my mind. But it will always be in the \"Wow! Look at that! Once in a lifetime!\" part.\n\nI give The Two Towers: 7/10"

LOTR: TTT is just as good as Fellowship if not better in some aspects.\n\nNew characters are introduced and they are just as interesting as the great cast of the first film. Bernard Hill is noticeably good as King Theoden who has a powerful scene at the grave of his son. I also liked Faramir. Yes, he is different from the book but I thought David Wenham's performance was heartfelt and real. Miranda Otto(Eowyn), Karl Urban(Eomer), and Brad Dourif(Grima Wormtongue) round out the great new cast.\n\nThe special effects are more frequent and extremely impressive. Gollum is a great acheivement in computer effects and definitely the most believable computer generated character. Treebeard and the ents also look fantastic. And the computer generated warriors at Helm's Deep are a sight to behold.\n\nThis film is filled with so many great moments that it's hard to pinpoint just one. Gollum/Smeagol's duality, Ents storming on Isengard, The Battle of Helm's Deep, Frodo offering the Ring, Gandalf's ride to victory, and Sam's final speech are all fantastic. See this film. Great performances, incredible special effects and intense action make Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers the best film of 2002. Bring on The Return of the King!"
