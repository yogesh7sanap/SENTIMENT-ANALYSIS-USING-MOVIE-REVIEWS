A cashgrab and nothing more from Disney.\n\n2.5/10."

The supporting characters are also bad they try so hard to be like the original characters. The plot is the worse there's no character development. The effects are so bad too at night you can tel it's cgi. The traps are also so bad. Just an awful film."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's hard to really rage over HOME SWEET HOME ALONE because I am 99% convinced Disney never intended for this thing to be good or even an alternative to the original HOME ALONE. They needed more content for the Disney + subscription service, no matter how insipid or cheap, and so here we are.\n\nThere's really not much to say about it-- it looks cheap, the acting is bad, and the writing is beyond hope. They try twisting on the usual formula by making the burglars sympathetic but this actually works against what has made the original HOME ALONE so popular over the last 30 years. Harry and Marv were absolutely in the wrong, and they were at the bare minimum a threat should they catch Kevin (I absolutely believe Joe Pesci when he threatens to bite that kid's fingers off), so all those gloriously violent booby trap sequences are way more fun. Here, my sympathy is with the thieves, who receive far more development than the main character, so it isn't fun watching them get hurt.\n\nAlso-- and this might be just me-- but is anyone else sick of the thick layers of Joss Whedon-esque irony that suffuses so many American movies now? It was funny and fresh in small doses years ago, but it's gotten old already. The dialogue in this movie is made even more obnoxious by the fact that everyone, from the kids to the Gen X adults, talk like stereotypes of millenials/Gen Z-ers-- you know, \"Oh wow, we left the kid home alone, hashtag reboot.\""

Director, cast and production all just dreadful. File this one under \"should not have happened\" but again in todays industry its about quantity not quality. Everyone involved got paid well but they'll probably regret doing this one later on in their careers.."

        "review_detailed_main": "The original two Home Alone movies that starred the charismatic Macaulay Culkin and the legendary Joe Pesci have been staples of Christmas movies now for more than a generation of children and adults alike. The central concept of a child being left at home and enjoying the freedom while at the same time having to stop his house from being robbed by two wannabe thieves trying to hit it big in the very nice neighbourhood. The second movie takes the core concept and twists it and has Kevin McCallister alone in New York City, the stakes are raised and the bumbling theives are back to exact there revenge on Kevin. The films are also peppered with feel good moments and interesting side characters and lessons about caring for your family.\n\nSo why make another movie??? What made the original movies so good was that the stories were unique and special at thr time. Also they had many excellent actresses and actors that brought the idea to life.... The story has been told. Nothing unique to the core story comes from this new movie. The only original characrer it has is Buzz who was a minor character before (and he was good)..... One can say that yes this movie uses new tricks that Kevin wouldn't have had in 1990. Yet just changing up that alone doesn't warrant a new movie and the story is nowhere near as good as the original two. You would wonder why Disney doesn't try to create something new and special for new generations of kids to hold on to. Instead of recycled ideas that weren't requested by annyone. So 1 out of 10... I don't blame the actors and actresses here. They're ok at their portrayal of the characters. But regardless the story underneath is like a thinly gold plated copper ring while the true 24 carat gold movie came out in 1990. Just avoid this movie, watch the amazing originals like I do each year or see some amazing content from elsewhere."

        "review_detailed_main": "It may end up looking better than both the 4th and 5th adaptation (yes there are 6 of these movies now), but Home Sweet Home Alone lacks any charisma, wit, or charm that made the original films so enjoyable and ends up feeling like an incredibly pointless and quite dated forced reboot comedy. The first thing that sticks out to me so clearly about this film is how painfully unfunny it is. Almost every minute of this film they try so hard to make each joke work and nothing ever lands, and instead your stuck watching the awkwardness unfold slower and slower until you can hardly stand to take it anymore. The actors are thankfully better than the last two adaptations, with some big names to star, however that doesn't mean they are by any means good in their roles- and again feels like the film missed a major opportunity. So many huge comedic stars, you think you would be able to get one laugh out of them, but sadly not. Pete Holmes and Ellie Kemper deserve better than this. The film is decently filmed, hardly feeling stale or fake like the forced Christmas atmosphere of the last two flicks, but despite the snowy setting and some decent shots- there is little to be joyful about in this miserable adaptation. The script and story is down right diabolical at times, hurtful, and just sad to watch. Not to mention lead child actor Archie Yates is justb a total brat and honestly makes me wonder who the hell we were supposed to root for throughout this film. In the end, Home Sweet Home Alone takes the franchise up a very slight notch, but it is obviously no where close to as good as the first 2 films, or even the third. Its forced sense of humor and misuse of talent should be a learning point for many Hollywood films here on- simply on how to not make a star-studded comedy. It's about as disappointing as they come, and as forgettable and frustrating as a film can possibly be.\n\nMy Rating: 1.5/10."

There is some decent comedy sprinkled here and there. Archie Yates give's a good enough performance, but doesn't come close to being as good as Macaulay Culkin. The two burglars are also kinda funny, and I liked how you kinda sympathize with them.\n\nAside from that though this a very dull movie that features boring characters, and weird pacing. This movie steals many things from the original, but never does anything with them. Also the kid in the movie while not badly portrayed is very unlikable. He isn't given enough character to make him interesting, and he's kinda the villain of the movie. Everything here feels like a carbon copy of the original. Also the trap sequence is very unsatisfying. They feel mean considering that we kinda sympathize with these people. Besides the trap sequence is like 15 minutes. That's it. It takes an hour for the movie to finally start, but then we get kinda boring traps. And finally this movie basically isn't even a sequel. The only reason is cause Buzz from the original makes one cameo, but honestly he doesn't even need to be there. He's in the move for like 3 minutes.\n\nOverall \"Home Sweet Home Alone\" isn't the worst of the series, but it's definitely one of the most dull. It has slow pacing, dull characters, strange story decisions, and just a lack of true joy that it was just really bad."

It doesn't give you a clear hero and villain which can be good but I don't know if that was the writer's intention. It's just like muddy. The main kid is an absolute brat. I would have left him home alone. And the \"Villains\" are decent people.\n\nThe type of story telling that I hate the most is \"whoops! It was all a big misunderstanding\" because when it's over you feel like you just wasted your time. If people had made \"human\" decisions to begin with the film wouldn't have had to happen so it seems like it was all for nothing. It's like full of air.

And like I said, the ending feels like you wasted an hour and a half because the issue could have been resolved in like 10 minutes.\n\nThe acting is fine and there was thought put into the script.

The owners of the artifact are in financial ruin and having to sell up their home to keep their family going. All they want is their doll back, but again the wealthy and well armed rich kid wins over the working class.\n\nYou can't get behind anyone. The biggest issue is that there is no villain. And arguably if you chose one it would be the boy, not the burglars.\n\nYou don't like the boy. You don't root for him. At all. He's not likable or motivated by anything other than further greed and selfishness.\n\nThere is no magic around being home alone. The point of \"I made my family disappear\" that sentiment of the original that Kevin learns the values of what his family love and connection is and his defending of it, the same as the mom wanting to get home realising she's put work and life ahead of family is also lost here."

Now I gave the story credit for trying to be different, and not be a carbon copy of the first film, and. Ellie Kemper and Rob Delaney play a good comedic team pretty well, has a couple trying to save there family home. But the kid Max played by Archie Yates, is just unbearable and unlike Kevin, no ways wants to root for him. But not Yates fault, just how he was written. Aisling Bea doesn't really give off much has Max's mother unlike Catherine O' Hara, seems like she is sleepwalking through this.\n\nJokes don't really hit, trap gags just become reminders that you've watch them in better movies, and Max's family are just there no other reason, unlike the first two. And it is not easy to capture the magic that was the first Home Alone(1990)."

I honestly wish there was SOMETHING positive for me too add, there isn't. You have a lot of good comic names, but sadly, they add nothing. The main child, I just hated. He was unlikable and had no charm like Culkin had.\n\nThere are no reason to actually like these character's, most of their back stories just don't finalize. What made the original \" Home Alone\" great was Catherine O' Hara, she showed a real genuine love to get home to her son. Yes, this had the same cookie cutter plot, without believing that mother really wants to get to Chicago.\n\nHome Alone, original, was not a ' great\" movie by any standard, but it is iconic. This reboot feels like a direct to Redbox film or a hotel \" exclusive\" film.\n\nMy final thought, pass. Watch Jungle Cruise again instead."

It has a very nice cameo too. Not spoiling anything though."

        "review_detailed_main": "And here we go again. So-called \"Home Alone 6\", the franchise that keeps being added to for reasons that nobody can remember.\n\nReleased on so-called \"Disney+ Day\" as a Disney+ Original, Home Sweet Home Alone to give it its actual title does what it says on the tin - a boy is left home alone by accident (through parents having made a hash of planning/leaving/rounding everybody up and then not noticing for quite some time they're missing a body. Meanwhile said kid ends up having to to booby trap the whole establishment to inflict some pain on some intruders.\n\nRegrettably if this is designed to entice people into Disney+ then you can probably be forgiven for thinking Disney+ is full of this sort of material, the rehashing of \"classics\" and the butchering of archive material. But that's for another day.\n\nArchie Yates gets the mantel for the lead character in a Home Alone (titled) film (probably off the back of his appearance in JoJo Rabbit), and does a decent effort with the material he's been served, but realistically even if Macaulay Culkin was still ten years old today he'd struggle to do much with this as well. I dare say any child actor who was cast would create a miracle out of the script.\n\nUnfortunately adding John Williams' Home Alone score and music cues doesn't make it a Home Alone movie, neither does sticking booby traps in a house, some bad guys and an insane amount of pain. No there has to be something else. This doesn't have it, and so it'll just be the latest in the line of dreary Home Alone wannabes without any concept of what made the first (and second) film work.\n\nOn the positive side, this is still better than the fourth film (which is hardly difficult), but it sits in my eyes quality wise between the fourth and fifth film. I believe I said in a previous review (for the fifth film) something along the lines of \"this doesn't get anywhere near Home Alone 1 and 2 and I'll be surprised if any future additions to this franchise get anywhere near them\". So I was right then :)\n\nMight be worth a watch to see what all the fuss is about but be warned: its a painful slog."

Otherwise they'll not even try and we miss out on entertainment that has nostalgia in it whilst being modern, stop being such misery's, new is different it doesn't affect the old classic, it's so dumb saying just watch the old ones.\n\nThe film starts a bit slow but as soon as the physical stuff kicks in it's genuinely enjoyable and it's quite sweet in places, way better than I thought it'd be, way better than the other 3 home alones made after the big 2. Ellie kemper is the star and glue that holds it together, whilst the dad (rob) was poorly cast and with a funnier more natural actor would've been better. It's genuinely entertaining. The hate was always going to exist even if they'd have won Oscars. The nods to the original like the music and Kevin's older brother were great.\n\nThe only issue really was being slow to get going and casting, the kid was an awful choice, no charisma, no humour and failed to portray any emotion, going \"yes\" after traps worked even felt forced, if they try again and I hope they do work harder on focus groups to get a hood kid actor . Also I loved aisling bea but after seeing her sitcom then this, she is just awful, her accent and acting are abysmal and really ruin the scenes she's in, she's a hood panel comedian that's it."

Ellie Kemper and Rob Delanely play the robbers, they had small roles in The Lego Batman Movie and Deadpool 2.\n\nHome Sweet Home Alone is similar but different to the original. The robbers are actually a nice married couple about to lose their house and they believe Max stole a priceless heirloom. They're actually the main characters instead of Max.\n\nHome Sweet Home Alone has some callbacks to the original like the score and Buzz McCallister who was naturally shown in the trailer. Buzz is a cop rather than a criminal. Kevin is mentioned but he doesn't show up.\n\nThe humor is so lazy, maybe some of the jokes were adlibbed. I wasn't in pain, I never felt the urge to shut if off in fact I honestly wanted to know the ending. A line Max says in the ending honestly moved me.\n\nOverall, Home Sweet Home Alone is really lame. We're all glad this movie is somewhat different but the filmmakers made the wrong choices. If you have kids, you could give it a shot."

        "review_detailed_main": "In 1990, a warm-hearted slapstick film called \"Home Alone\" was a surprise blockbuster hit, breaking the record for the highest-grossing live-action comedy, nominated for a Golden Globe, and followed by three sequels. This quasi-remake, \"Home Sweet Home Alone,\" keeps the basic storyline about a child accidentally left behind who defends his home from would-be burglars with complicated contraptions. It even includes an actor from the original, and a child slapping his cheeks in astonishment, the original's iconic image. But it misses the key elements that made both the slapstick and the sentiment of the 1990 version appealing. Yates' nicely understated delivery is not used as effectively here as it was in \"JoJo Rabbit.\" To get away from his extended family, Max goes to the garage and climbs into the back seat of the car to watch Road Runner cartoons (a clear inspiration for all of the \"Home Alone\" movies). Instead of the cartoonishly bumbling robbers of the original film, who made it easy to enjoy their downfall, the \"home sweet home\" is just as important to this film's intruders, a married couple played by the endlessly likeable Ellie Kemper (Pam) and Rob Delaney (Jeff). They are under a lot of financial stress because Jeff has lost his job as a data migration expert. The way he and Pam refer to \"the cloud\" as the reason he is out of work is probably the movie's best joke. Jeff's obnoxious show-off brother Hunter (Timothy Simons, underused) and his wife and son arrive to make Jeff feel even worse about not providing for his family. As ridiculous as it is for Pam and Jeff to try to break into Max's house to retrieve the doll, we want them to get it back so they can stay in their home. And as ridiculous as it is for Max to set up booby traps that would impress both Rube Goldberg and Navy Seals, we can understand that he feels vulnerable and is trying to do what he can to stay safe. The original film had a genuinely touching subplot of family reconciliation to add tenderness to the over-the-top pratfalls. This one only gestures feebly at the kind of cozy connections that made the conclusion of the earlier film comforting and even meaningful."

But I enjoyed this with my 12 year old. I definitely had my reservations as most will or do. But as modern twist to the style of home alone film, I'd say give it more credit. The acting was actually decent and not some cheesy b movie acting level. The amount of well known actors/actresses that know how to act also helped carry the film. The jokes weren't insanely funny but I definitely chuckled more than I expected to. If you want a modern twist to an old favorite, give it a go and just remember nothing will come close to the originals."

I did give this a go and i jusy couldn't enjoy it at all, there's nothing i liked, its bland, boring and they just used the same songs as the Macauley Culkin movies which felt like a terrible idea.\n\nReally didn't enjoy but some people might like this, just not for me being such a fan of the classics."

I'm not an adult child so it doesn't bother me that it's a knock off of the original or whatever these babies are complaining about. The movie pokes fun at itself as well. Having buzz in it is a great throwback. It's an interesting twist having both the robbers and the kid ultimately be likeable, relatable, and redeeming characters. My whole family enjoyed it, I've watched it many times and would recommend it to anyone who isn't a grinchy miserable scrooge."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's sad and pathetic how a movie that takes advantage of people's collective memory can't even do it in the dumbest and most simplistic way, it doesn't even try. Home sweet home alone (2021) remake of Home alone directed by chris columbus, (1990), is a movie that drops from the premise; \"a spoiled little boy and only son of a single and not at all nice mom obsessed with work has to stop two moronic idiots who thought he had a valuable maggifin for the resolution of a conflict that nobody is interested in getting into their house\". From the script, this movie is total crap, but more importantly, because it makes no sense, we shouldn't care so much about it, at least not enough to watch it once, and never see it again in the little or much time we have to live; being that both the original and the sequel are more than Christmas classics of all the times, you can see for miles what immediately makes it a clumsy insult, full of commercial brands and out-of-place jokes. Every character that appears here is either a poorly made copy of the original, or a malicious modern reinterpretation of it, but hiding under ideals of intent and insertion. What's worse, having a bad character who wants to give himself a better life than he has on his own merits, or a brainless person who tries to give free rein to his means just for a selfish situation that could have been solved in the right way more than easily, and even more having technological tools at hand?.... In short, it's mixing the first and the third movie, or rather making a pseudo remake of the third movie with elements of the first one so that the audience feels it was worth watching, which leaves down to the ground any desire to recommend it not only to a casual audience, but even to any child fan of the last seasons of south park or merry melodies. It assembles a bunch of comic actors with nothing to do, with a script written in a day and a half or two, along with all the technical luxuries that disney can offer to two sloppy directors whose success resides in writing for films that are not tied to a conventional plot and the result is absurd in a bad way, a mockery of the comedy of the original, a spit of red-green that thinks it is more imaginative and aggressive, but fails in so many ways, it is simply unbelievable that it has come out at all. This film makes everything that followed after 1992 look like a masterpiece. Undoubtedly a dreadful remake, which I thank all the saints it is on disney plus, and not disney channel or the like so my family or someone close to me can easily watch it.\n\n2.5/10."

Trying to appeal to a younger audience by using words like lit and describing something as a W or L, it's painful to watch, there is over 30 examples of them doing this and it thuds every time.\n\nAll the Home Alones since the 3rd have been dire but this takes it to a whole other level. This may well be one of the worst movies i've ever seen. I believe the movie itself said it best with the line - \"Uh, this is garbage. I don't know why they are always trying to remake the classics. Never as good as the originals\".\n\nI Hated this movie. The worst movie of 2021. Shame On You Yorki."

That would have brought the stars up for this movie. I've always thought to do a Home Alone sequel justice, why not do one that Kevin Mccallister accidentally leaves his kid at home and the sticky bandits fresh out of prison show up to the house it all started now owned by Kevin. This time getting punishment dished out by Kevin's son. Like father like son. Back to this film, I as a mega fan of the original two movies, found this to be a fun watch and enjoyed the nostalgia that was in it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Home Sweet Home Alone is a complete disaster. The trailer didn't look all that great, but I was hoping for at least a fun holiday movie. Oh boy, this movie is even worse than you can possibly imagine. It's one of the worst movies I've watched all year.\n\nThe original Home Alone works because it's this great adventure-like story of a kid being left home alone and the sort of things he gets into. Then he encounters these burglars who are bad people and want to break in to rob his house. He then takes measures to protect it and because these burglars are bad people we enjoy watching them fall into the traps and get hurt. Not only that, but it's a great movie about family trying to be together for Christmas. It's filled with great themes and has a great heart.\n\nHome Sweet Home Alone forgets all of this and makes a completely joyless movie that doesn't work at all.\n\nInstead of the movie focusing on Max Mercer being \"home alone\" the movie instead focuses mainly on the two \"burglar\" characters. They are the ones we follow. They are the ones we care about. The movie isn't about the kid being home alone, it's about these two burglar characters being in bad place in life and making a poor decision. However, because of the way the movie portrays everything, we're not really rooting against the burglars! We almost agree with what they're doing. The movie is basically propelled forward because of a misunderstanding. So when the \"burglars\" are getting hurt and caught in the trap it's not really enjoyable at all. We're not rooting for the kid. We're almost rooting against him and thats not what you want from a Home Alone movie!\n\nThere's no adventure for a kid being left home alone. We get a two minute montage of him playing in the house and eating junk food...but thats it! There's no scenes. Of him going shopping, decorating the house, doing adult chores. Thats some of the charm of the original. Watching a kid be responsible. Here we get nothing. We don't follow the kid at all! He's a supporting character. Why call the movie Home Sweet HOME ALONE if you're not evem following the kid who is HOME ALONE?\n\nWe don't even get to know the family at all. We get maybe two to three scenes of the mom trying to get back and that's it. There's no scene of regret from the mom, no character growth for the mom. There's just no characters at all in the family. They're just people that are there.\n\nArchie Yates is good in the movie. I think he's a talented child actor. He was fantastic in Jojo Rabbit, but unfortunately he's given nothing to work with here. Elle Kemper is good, as is Rob Delaney, but again their talent is wasted in this abysmal movie.\n\nThe best part of this movie is the cameo from Buzz McCallister. He has a great scene in the movie that actually made me laugh. It was a clever scene and one that I rewound to watch again because of how good it was.\n\nOverall. This movie is a complete disaster. Watch the original two. Don't waste your time with this. I watched it so you don't have to."

You can feel why Max wants to be left alone, and he's not a brat about it like Kevin in the original. The burglars have a good reason and story for why they want to break into his house, the end has a clever twist and expectation subversion that I fully respect. And the end was really sweet and heartwarming.\n\nAdd in some nods to the originals and other movies and you have a solidly fine yet familiar \"Home Alone\"."

All the characters are very dislikable. You actually HOPE the child spends christmas alone because he's a nasty, annoying little psychopath.\n\nThey don't introduce the characters properly or slow the action to get an emotional connection.\n\nNot even a cameo from buzz mccallister in the original movie saved it in any capacity. It just reminded us to go straight over to watch the original ... Avoid!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Everything about this movie sucks. The kid, the traps, the characters, the \"burglars.\" First of all, the kid here is extremely punch-able, he's way too overpowered, has way too many high tech items to beat up the villains, and is a horrible person overall. What's his motive though? The married couple is trying to take a valuable doll that the kid \"stole.\" Yeah, not very good.\n\nThe humor is also extremely bad. It's awkwardly unfunny and stupid. This entire script felt like it was written by a guy who had to ask his kids what slang words are popular, and what a \"Fortnite\" is. There is a joke at the beginning of a movie where the family is watching an 'Angels with filthy souls' remake. (The fake movie in the original Home Alone with Johnny and Snakes) The dad then says \"Why do they remake the classics, they're never as good as the original.\" Haha. Good one Disney. Meta does not equal funny.\n\nThe traps as well are absolutely awful. It's just slapstick repeats of the original ones but modernized to cause more carnage. The kid puts a VR headset onto one of the burglars, and makes it look like he's in more danger than he really is.\n\nFinally, this movie just doesn't work. What makes the original Home Alone movies so good, is that they came out just before cell phones became a thing. If this scenario were to happen in real life, it would be solved instantly. Overall, this is just a garbage movie made by Disney to rake in the most amount of money by trying as little as possible, and pandering to the fans of the originals. Buzz is in this as a cop and is absolutely insufferable. He's a dumb failure of a cop that is only here to connect both movies and talk about Kevin in one scene.\n\nWouldn't recommend this to anyone unless you're a fan of bad movies. 1/10 would give 0 if I could."

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched this movie when it first started streaming on Disney+ at Christmas two years ago. And that was enough for me! This is without a doubt the worst movie in the Home Alone franchise! The first two are classics, the 3rd one is okay, and the 4th and 5th are at best, only mildly funny (though the former really does the first two dirty). But this one? This thing is abominable.\n\nFirst of all, the story is ridiculous. It focuses on Jeff McKenzie (played by Rob Delaney) and his wife Pam (Ellie Kemper), who live in Chicago with their two kids, and are on the verge of losing their house, because Jeff is out of a job. As soon as they find out that a malformed doll that they own is worth a lot of money, they plan to sell it on eBay, but find it missing. They end up suspecting that a British (for whatever reason) 12-year-old boy named Max Mercer (Archie Yates), who stopped at their home with his mother during an open house to use the restroom, stole it. Meanwhile, Max has accidentally been left home alone by his family (sound familiar?), who's going to Tokyo, because he fell asleep while hiding out in the car, watching cartoons. So, what do Jeff and Pam do? They plan to break into Max's house to steal the doll back, without talking to Max about it. Max misinterprets it as a planned kidnapping, so he booby-traps his house just for them. Yeah. That is the stupidest conflict I've ever heard of.\n\nIn regards to the characters: Max, our so-called \"hero\", is wholly obnoxious. He has none of the character depth or charm of our TRUE hero, Kevin McCallister, from the first two movies. He's just an incredibly one-dimensional little brat, and early on, all we see of him is him complaining to his mom for not getting him McDonald's, whining that he hates his family, with no explanation as to why. Remember the pizza scene in the original movie? That was where we learned why we were expected to root for Kevin; he felt like his family mistreated him. Here, there's no such scene. We ALSO get no scene of Max going through anything that makes him come to realize he wants his family back, and instead, he's overjoyed over having the house to himself, before suddenly wanting them back out of nowhere, just a few minutes later. There's no build-up or development to his realization, the way we saw Kevin, after the initial joy over being alone, develop and mature so much over the course of the first movie, and come to realize how much he took his family for granted. Instead, more screentime is devoted to Jeff and Pam, and it ends up making THEM easier to root for. And because of that, the physical pain that Max inflicts on them is actually not funny at all. What made the pain that Kevin inflicted on Harry and Marv hilarious in the first two movies was that they were actually burglars who DERSERVED it, and the same can be said for the 3rd, 4th and 5th movies. Here, the so-called \"burglars\" are actually completely innocent, though very stupid people, with sympathetic motivations, so the slapstick that Max puts them through is just mean-spirited.\n\n*spoiler*Even worse, it ends up being all for nothing, because the REAL thief was Jeff and Pam's nephew. And then, when he gives the doll back, he's praised for \"saving the day\", and Jeff and Pam forgive Max after clearing up the misunderstanding! WHAT?!!!?*end spoiler*\n\nAlso, the special effects: remember the amazing practical effects from the first couple movies? Well, this movie throws that out in favor of horrible CGI effects, even for 2021's standards, ESPECIALLY compared to the amazing CGI in all the movies by Marvel Studios! Have people forgotten how to animate CGI effects over the years?!\n\nThe acting is atrocious, ESPECIALLY by Archie Yates as Max! He shows none of the talent that Macaulay Culkin showed as Kevin. Even Rob Delaney and Ellie Kemper don't seem to care at all about their roles. It seems like nobody was trying at all. By the way, this movie contains a cameo by Devin Ratray, who reprises his role as Kevin's bullying older brother, Buzz, from the first two movies (so this movie wisely ignores the 4th movie), now grown up to be a police officer. Unfortunately, though he does mention Kevin and the events of the first two movies, even he can't save this!\n\nAnd of course, there's the music. John Debney's score is so lame, and in fact, I don't even remember how any of the cues go! Especially compared to John Williams's amazing score from the first two movies. Not to mention, there's a blasphemous misuse of \"Somewhere in my Memory\", that gorgeous song from the first movie. It's awful.\n\nSo, everything considered, Home Alone 6 is one of the worst movies ever made, and is easily rock-bottom for the Home Alone franchise. With an idiotic and completely unoriginal story, incompetent writing, utterly botched characterizations, and completely sadistic, unfunny humor, this abomination does this wonderful franchise dirty, and John Hughes would roll over in his grave if he saw it. If you see this movie listed on Disney+, don't be tempted. Stop at Home Alone 2, or if you're a big fan, 3, 4, and/or 5 might be worth a viewing, but NEVER this one! Avoid at all costs!"

I was still excited to see it, but about 10 minutes in, I realized that this was going to be a terrible movie. First off, I don't know if Archie Yates had to beat out a bunch of kids for the role, or if he was their first choice, but he was one of the most unlikable protagonists that I've ever seen. He had zero charisma and his personality made me root against him the entire movie. I don't who the \"good guy\" is supposed to be in this movie. The McKenzies are too nice to be villains, but too dumb to be heroes. Regardless, when they are subjected to the booby traps, the slapstick is more sad than funny. You don't want the obnoxious brat to win, so you just want all the \"hijinks\" to be over as soon as possible. Unfortunately this movie will probably put an end to the Home Alone franchise."

Of course not, but that doesn't make it a 3.6.\n\nYes, you may find the kid kind of annoying, and it's cheesy, but that's what you expect from a Christmas movie! This delivers plenty of laughs, the traps are clever and interesting, there's a decent twist, and the acting is mostly good, too. Including cameos from Butch from those beloved originals, and Kenan Thompson from Kenan and Kel!\n\nI genuinely believe people are only giving this film such negative reviews because they're directly comparing it to the classic originals. That is a shame, but it's also kind of on Disney by naming it as they did. If a few details were changed and the film had a different name, I genuinely believe the reviews would have been much better!\n\nTry not to be a cynic, switch off your brain off for 96 minutes and give this a go. You never know; you might even enjoy it. I know I did!"

Also changing Harry and Marv from ruthless crooks to a couple (albeit cartoonish and stupid) just down on their luck, was the worst part of the movie for me\n\nPlease Disney stop doing these obvious cash grabs, just because you can, doesn't mean you should."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Good: This movie literally has me wondering if good writing and sensible filmic decisions have gone out the window. It seems like the idea of a \"timeless\" children's classic is getting further and further away from us. Aside from Frozen, I really can't think of another children's film that has stood the test of time, and that includes Pixar films. This movie at least prompted a reflection of the sad state of mainstream Hollywood filmmaking, I guess.\n\nEllie Kemper is also too charismatic not to be funny.\n\nThe Bad: You can generally tell how bad or good a film is by how much twisting the writers do to make the plot work and how consistent the characters act. If that's the standard to apply...this movie might be the worst of the year.\n\nWe begin with Max, a precocious, annoying, whiny, selfish little brat, who we're expected to root for. He can't bare the wait getting to his McMansion to use the washroom, so forces his mother to stop at a random open house. He uses the washroom and proceeds to insult the homeowner, a man named Jeff (played by Ron Delaney) about an antique doll collection he owns. Understandably offended by this little twerp, he drinks a soft drink in front of him without offering. We are led to believe Max steals one of the dolls in retaliation.\n\nWe come to learn that Jeff and his wife, played by Ellie Kemper, are in serious financial distress and are being pressured to sell their home. They have two children, who understandably don't want to leave their home. When Jeff discovers that the doll in his closet is worth $200K and that it is likely that Max stole it, he and Ellie (I'm really not going to remember the her character's name) embark to retrieve it. You know, his OWN property stolen by this kid.\n\nHSHA flips the script, whether intentionally or not, to make the bandits more sympathetic than the rich, annoying British kid. We see as he torments these people with traps that feel like kid versions of Saw traps. Quite bizarre. As such, this movie isn't as much \"fun,\" as it is a frustrating exercise to get through. The problem is so unbelievably easy to solve, yet we see two grown adults engage in the dumbest behaviour possible for absolutely no reason. This by itself, makes this movie absolute garbage.\n\nBut on top of that, the movie looks TERRIBLE. Remember the warmth cinematic quality of the original? This one looks like a TV show. Remember the fantastic score? This one sounds like the dollar store version. Remember the funny jokes and sensible characters? Nope. Let's have Ally Wong play annoying stepmom and people fart on each other. Great.\n\nThe Ugly: The audacity of this film is that it tries to shoehorn in a happy ending, one that comes out of absolutely nowhere. The Home Alone theme swells and you may briefly feel something. Don't be fooled. This movie sucks."

Immediately that makes it lack the same appeal as the original, which was a kid fighting back against robbers trying to steal his family's possessions.\n\nEverything about it feels forced. Whereas the original was a \"normal\" family film with genuinely funny and charming characters and moments, this one feels like it's desperately trying to be funny, and it just doesn't work.\n\nThere wasn't a single bit of genuinely funny, nor fun, moments. I guess some children might enjoy the fart jokes and silliness, but that isn't what makes the original Home Alone so enjoyable; it didn't have to rely on cheap gimmicks or jokes. While the original was silly in places, it was on a solid base of a strong story and characters, and it wasn't trying to force laughs.\n\nAs Chris Columbus, the director of the original, said so accurately \"it's a waste of time as far as I'm concerned. What's the point? I'm a firm believer that you don't remake films that have had the longevity of Home Alone. You're not going to create lightning in a bottle again. It's just not going to happen. So why do it? It's like doing a paint-by-numbers version of a Disney animated film - a live-action version of that. What's the point? It's been done. Do your own thing. Even if you fail miserably, at least you have come up with something original.\""

We as a people are not historically kind to child actors but we know two things about Archie Yates: he was brilliant in JoJo Rabbit so he CAN act, and it isn't his fault that the screenplay is just utter trash.

They were trying to claim a antique doll that was there. Except, the kid Max (Archie Yates) took from there house. It was difficult to even care for Max when he was annoying and more of the bad guy. The characters are unlikable. The script is annoying with cringy dialogue. The humor is stupid. Lacks the fun the other films had. And there was not one good thing about the film."

I'm giving it a high rating, so go ahead and be a troll and give me a thumbs down and tell me my review isn't helpful because yall don't agree with me.\n\nWhen I saw the trailer, I did roll my eyes and didn't care much for the kid, but when I watched it, he grew on me a little bit. This new installment in the Home Alone series (We're up to the 6th one now) is a LOT better then the previous two films, but it's still not as good as the original. To me, this feels like the true 'Home Alone 3' because one of the original stars from the originals makes an appearance, and they use the classic John Williams theme music. I was intrigued by the story, and it managed to make me feel nostalgic, especially when they play 'Somewhere in my Memory' This time, we get to know the burglars, and come to care for them and why they're doing the robbing.\n\nMeet Pam and Jeff McKenzie, a down-on-their-luck couple who have to sell their house because it's getting too expensive to live there. They haven't told their children yet. During an open house, they run into 10-year old Max Mercer and his mom, Carol. They're only there because Max needed to stop and use the bathroom. On the way out, Max notices an ugly doll with an upside-down face. Max and Jeff have words over it and they finally leave. That night, Jeff researches the doll and finds that it's extremely rare and worth a lot. The only problem is that the doll is now missing.\n\nThe next day, Max's family is on the way to the airport to Japan, and of course, Max gets left home alone. He reacts the same way Kevin McCallister did, then he gets bored and lonely. Pam and Jeff assume that Max took the doll, and track him to his house and try to get it back. Max unfortunately misunderstands their intentions and begins his battle plan to strike back against the burglars.\n\nI honestly feel that this movie is worthy of the Home Alone name. It gave me nostalgic feels like the first two, it has the classic John Williams music and it gave me a few laughs. I wouldn't mind watching it again. There are other easter eggs and nods to the original classic, too. If you love the franchise, I would highly recommend HOME SWEET HOME ALONE!!!"

Home Sweet Home Alone was downright appallingly bad.\n\nI thought the premise was in very poor taste. A family that is struggling financially believes their rare doll (the solution to their financial woes) to have been stolen by a rich brat. This poor husband and wife spend much of the movie getting punished by this annoying kid. I was cringing at how tone deaf this plot was. Let's laugh at poor people who have to go to crazy lengths just to keep their home. Meanwhile, the rich annoying kid has to sleep in a BMW?\n\nThe acting was horrible. I can't believe Ellie Kemper (Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt) did this movie. They should've given it a different name like Homeless for the Holidays to complete the tone deaf narrative. This film doesn't deserve the Home Alone title in its name."

Why would one make a modern day adaptation of an all-time classic? Maybe to appeal to the current generation of kids and give them ideas on how to target intruders or just to mint money. Thank god this was an direct to OTT release because this would have bombed big time if it was not.\n\nSet during Christmas, the Mercer family are on their way to Tokyo for the holidays. They leave a young sleepy kid, Max Mercer behind; all alone at home. Enter Jeff & Pam; parents who are struggling financially. They suspect that Max has stolen a prized doll from their open house and try to take it back by breaking and entering. And yes, Max's mom rushes back from Tokyo.\n\nIf you are adapting the movie for the current generation, make some significant changes at least. The major change we see here is the motivation of the intruders. They are not thieves. They just want what is theirs. This is a typical Disney move; everyone has a backstory; in this case a sob story. There is also the accent. Basically, mommy Mercer & Max Mercer are British. Yes, that makes a lot of difference!\n\nMax Mercer is played by Archie Yates of Jojo Rabbit fame. He is a kid alright but it is quite difficult not to compare him to Macaulay Culkin. The two intruders are played by Ellie Kemper & Rob Delaney. Both usually have excellent comic timing. But the slapstic routine doesn't work for them. Nevertheless, it is always fun to watch them in action.\n\nWe also get a peek into what McCallister is doing now with Buzz McCallister's character making an appearance as a cop.\n\nHome Sweet Home Alone is a failed attempt at recreating an all-time holiday classic for the current generation. The thing is; the original is an evergreen classic. It works for every generation. Disney, you are better than this!"

The movie even acknowledges this by one character saying that people shouldn't remake classics ... ah the irony. But I reckon they see themselves as a sequel/reimagination of some kind. One link being one of Kevins brothers, now all grown up. I reckon because they couldn't get McCaulkey himself ... neither of them actually, they went for someone else.\n\nIt is not his fault the movie is being so ill received. It has something to do that the villains here are being made human. Well simple minded, totally ridiculous ones, that are borderline kids when it comes to certain situations they find themselves in, but likeable ones because their quest is pure. Well it involves breaking and entering (no matter what the main character says about having the key and sometimes remembering the alarm code or not, conveniently I might add), so maybe not entirely pure, but you get the gist.\n\nBut if that is what breaks the movie for you - well you have quite the romantic view of the original. Kevin was not a good kid by any mean of that word. And he was just as vile if not even more - especially in the sequel. Yes he might have looked cuter than the \"Kevin\" of this movie (he has a different name, I forgot it, sorry), but he isn't. At all! Having said that, you may feel different and that is ok. If you do not like this - it is so. It is just a shame that a movie that is overall similar, in tone, jokes and traps, gets so much hate, when it isn't that different from the original. Or maybe that is what makes is unbearable for some - although again, it is not a Remake in many senses. Because of the backstory of the \"villains\". You decide what you make of it."

It's the most original one besides the very first movie. The protagonist isn't a protagonist at all. Also, after reading some of the reviews, people seemed to look over Buzz being in the movie. That's actually Buzz from the first movie. That's a great nod to the first one. If some of y'all have done your homework, you'd know that the original robbers will not reprise their roles regardless of pay.\n\nThis movie is hilarious. The comedy is gold. The dad in this movie is outstanding and the shining light. It's not hard to put your negativity aside and watch with an open heart. This movie blows Home Alone 3, 4 and 5 out of the water. No doubt about that. There's nothing wrong with giving a bad score. But without constructive criticism and just spewing hate because of the dislike is not a review at all. It's just someone being upset in their lives enough to trash a movie for no reason."

        "review_title": "Well, what did you expect?",
        "review_detailed_main": "Being roughly Macaulay Culkin's age, I fully remember the impact that Home Alone had on kids at the time. It's perfect balance of sentimentality and slapstick made it an event upon it's release and endlessly re-watchable when it would inevitably pop up on cable each Christmas. It's goofy, but well made enough that it stands the test of time, and I can't imagine why any modern kid would be pinning for an update, unless they seriously just can't imagine a world without an Alexa. Which begs the question of who this remake is even for, when old folks like me long grew out of it and knew well enough to stay away from the endless sequels that trickled out over the years.\n\nBut for anyone who seems visibly angered by this films existence, I urge you to consider this: Home Sweet Home Alone didn't even have a theatrical release, so no one forced you to spend 15 bucks to sit in a dark room giving it your undivided attention. If you have Disney+, it just appeared one day for free, and it was obvious what it was gonna be; holiday fluff you could stick on in the background and still be able to follow while you finish some Christmas chores or nurse an eggnog hangover.\n\nSure, making the burglars sympathetic doesn't work as well as real bad guys, but there's literally 3 other movies that you already didn't watch that have that exact premise, so at least they tried something new. Sure, she's no Joe Pesci, but Ellie Kemper's patented over acting does fit the intended cartoonish tone. Sure there are some childish jokes and stretches of logic, but this is a Home Alone movie after all. It's got a bigger budget than the last two, so it doesn't reek of \"made for TV movie\". There's a couple easter eggs that nod towards the first film, and their incorporation of the John Williams score does trigger some nostalgia.\n\nIf you want a timeless family classic, just watch the original, again. If you've seen it too recently and want some light Yuletide pablum that tells a familiar story without challenging your brain in any way, well then this exists."

Of course Disney wasn't going to waste an opportunity milking the franchise, but this installment does rate somewhat better than previous releases, like Home Alone 3. The writers of this film were creative enough to add some subtle links to the Chris Columbus helmed films of the 1990s, which is fun if you're a fan. But the subtleties are so quick, you may not notice them.\n\nThe other downside of Disney owning the franchise rights now, and this film being released to Disney+, you have to be a Disney+ subscriber in order to see the movie. Unless you know someone! Disney could make a bundle of money if they released to disc some of the content they have on their streaming platform.\n\nAnyway, the story isn't completely original, a rehashing of the 'thieves stealing from a kid who sets up traps' mantra. The best parts are the tidbits linking the McAllister family. But it will never live up to the original Home Alone, or the superiority of Home Alone 2 (which was a masterpiece of casting and creativity)."

I don't see any enjoyment watching two people (who didn't do anything bad after all) getting tortured by an eight year old - hell, it might even be cringe worthy for little kids. It's generally not a film that has received positive criticism from the majority of the viewers and critics, and I can see why. The 10 star reviews here are just some rare exceptions, or maybe people who don't know what they're saying - I personally found no enjoyment while watching this.\n\nJust don't do watch it - the plot doesn't make any sense and the characters are either dull or idiotic. You may enjoy the traps in the third act (Maybe, although I doubt since the burglars are quite sympathetic here) along with some jokes here and there, but that's it.

Of course, the whole scenario is ridiculously unlikely. Everything could have been solved in a quick and amiable way but then it wouldn't have been a \"Home Alone\" movie. Well, actually it strays so far from the original concept that it isn't anything but a cheap attempt to attract more viewers through the title. It's nothing like the first two movies."

Why are these same tired tropes given air time in every movie... why???\n\nThe fat speccy eyed English kid was obnoxious, rude and could illicit no other emotion than distain from the viewer. In stark contrast Kevin was an affable cheeky warm hearted kid and you cared about his actual well-being.\n\nYou also felt for Kevin's mum in the original as there was actual narrative to her despair at losing her child and her efforts to reunite with him at enormous physical and emotional cost to her. This is a story arc and illicites feeling for her character, this element is completely missing in this version, she has a Karen, gets a flight and hates the fat guy next to her on the flight home.\n\nJust do yourself a favour and watch our 1990 version and feel good about yourself and your family!"

In the beginning, Max isn't that much of a likable character to the audience unlike the original Kevin, so it was harder to watch. And the couple was ok, but they annoyed me because of how dumb and immature they were even though they were supposed to be the humble adults.\n\nI thought the cameo of Buzz was funny, and they were even making fun of the movie because they said something like \"why make a remake, the original is always better\" or something like that. The music is familiar and there's a lot of Home Alone references in it which is cute.\n\nThe iconic booby trap scene didn't have a lot of build up to it, it just felt kind of meh and wasn't OMG. Wasn't as exciting, but they couldn't make the traps that deathly in the movie because the \"criminals\" are good people.\n\nOverall, this movie would be good for younger kids to watch with the family. The younger generation would understand the jokes more because there's some weird \"trendy\" humor in it."

They use some of the music we all know, it's a nostalgic one and a half hour movie, easy to watch. It has it's own weaknesses, like the actor's play, or some stupid script action, but from all the 6 movie, this is my third one.

Those were some cool moments.\n\nFunny thing is, I don't necessarily see this new kid Max as being less hostile to his robbers Pam and Jeff. I was expecting the violence to be toned down because of the complaints Home Alone got for how Kevin went at it on the Wet Bandits, a duo of thieves trying to rob Kevin's house and seemed willing to kill him to do it, mind you. At least Pam and Jeff had a very justifiable and very Christmas perfect reason to need to break into Max's house. It feels like they tried to tone down the punishment, but I don't see how you can make this kind of movie without someone getting hurt bad, which is done on a less cartoonish effect but still...\n\nWell at best this was a decent Christmas movie that came way too early proving how we are totally trying to wipe out Thanksgiving."

Yes, there can be a bit of a timeline years later after the first two Home Alone films. But this movie doesn't care to make anything new out of Home Alone that's actually about the future of Kevin and his family. Instead, this movie regards to be trendy for the children with modern technology and toys. Since this is a reboot to Home Alone, it's no surprise the story is lazily written. The characters are all annoying and their connection is illogical. All we see the \"villains\" of the movie we see is just break into Max's house just for a valuable doll. Seriously, there are much better ways to make the villains that's not the McKenzies. And the big problem, the humor. I think this has the worst comedy of the year. The movie would supply pop culture references, gross jokes, repeated jokes and a large amount of slapstick. Do I really need to make a recommendation? Just skip this film and go with the first two. Even if the second was the same as the first, at least it was much more tolerable than the other reboots like this one. I thought America The Motion Picture wasn't funny, but this film take the cake as the most unfunny movie of the year. At this rate, Fox should hold down from making anymore Home Alone movies."

The problem with this approach, is that it makes the viewer way more sympathetic to these characters, who aren't Eagle Scouts, but lack any actual malice. So it's not fun to watch them get hurt by the traps, it's just sad.\n\nAnother problem is that this leaves Max very under-developed and much less the sympathetic underdog that Kevin was. The actor is clearly older, and never really seems scared or worried about his predicament. His Family is also very under-developed. If you blink you'll miss his Dad, it's not clear who everyone in the Family even is. You never see a Cousin or Sibling ever being mean to him or worry about him being home alone. Basically, Max has a little fun in the house, then gets bored, and starts to miss his family a bit. This is like 10 minutes tops of screen time.\n\nSo, despite some attempts to shake things up, the only thing this changes from the original is that it makes the Kid less likable and the Burglars more sympathetic, so it's not clear who we're even supposed to be rooting for.\n\nThe film did have some funny moments, and I thought the cast did the best they could. But I would skip this one."

What kind of home alone movie would it be without a kid being left home alone? This movie is one of disneys best originals and only bested by the likes of under wraps, zenon and smart house. There is no reason for anyone to give this a one. If you were expecting the SIXTH MOVIE in a series to hit like the first one you are delusional. I'm not saying this movie is ground breaking or a 10/10 but a solid film to enjoy with the kiddos. Other words I would use to describe the chuds who gave this a two or less is as follows: stuck up, self aggrandizing, entitled, unable to analyze a movie on its own merits, arrogant, self important and stuck in the past. Go ahead and give me a thumbs down if you scrooges with hearts two sizes too small agree with my assessment."

Also, the script is just lazy. There are many jokes that try to be on-the-nose with regards to \"people remaking the classic, and how they aren't as good as the originals\".

They tried to add horror but failed miserably so when u can see that the franchise is getting so many negative reactions from public why make another one BUT NO NO NO we got home sweet home alone although i won't say this is bad as part 4 and 5 but it's also NOT GOOD idk why but i think a lot of the actors did overacting but i actually like the acting of the thieves but i won't call them thieves because there is not thief in this movie it's all about a freaking doll which was with; ok i won't give spoilers. I don't hate the idea of bringing buzz from home alone 1 and 2 but I thought that McCallister badge would be of Kevin so just because of the 2 thieves and that buzz McCallister i will give this movie a 1.5 \u2728 out of 5 and 3 out of 10 but please stop releasing more of home alone remakes anyways my Christmas is ruined so don't ruin yours goodbye."

The rest of Maxs family are vapid, just like Rob McKenzies brothers family, reminiscent of National Lampoons Christmas Vacation. Even the presence of SNL stalwart Kenan Thompson can't bring it up.\n\nThe premise is much the same as previous iterations; extended family goes on holiday, forget the son who wishes to be on their own and shenanigans ensue. But given all the family development, the house defence gets barely any time. The cameos by a series alum gets about as much time!\n\nMaybe a good Disney+ content filler, but the series is continuing its quality decline."

The police was quite dumb and didn't arrest them even though the kid was telling him to do so he should of said it louder or more times I guess. The family are hardly in the movie. I didn't really care that the other family just wanted there dull back I thought it was a bit unnecessary and didn't really add much to the overall story. It has a joyful ending though. Overall disappointed.\n\nRating stands at 4.8/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "I won't watch this. Previous to seeing the trailer, I already knew I wouldn't watch it. Aside from the first two beloved classics, I saw the 3rd and I was horrified at how bad it was. Why on Earth would I watch the 4th and 5th? Now Disney acquires 20th Century Fox and makes a 6th!!!!!! I saw the trailer and it was enough to nail that door shut in perpetuity because you know another and another will keep coming BECAUSE PEOPLE WATCH THEM!!! (Whether out of curiosity or, well, who knows). Disney gets new subscribers for it and people watch it.\n\nIf you really liked it and/or the kids did, awesome, it was worth your time and expense if you subscribed for the first time. Everyone is allowed their opinion. We all have different tastes. But if you went in knowing you would hate it but curious, then don't complain it's a crime against the originals. Disney wins. Nearly 12k rated this, some were probably new. Imagine how many actually watched it and hated it??\n\nI get the service because I love the live action from the 60's and 70's, the classic Christmas and Halloween movies, Pixar and the Simpsons. I have seen the Marvel movies and the series'. I, however, will not pay the premium for some of the new movies. That's absurd. I can wait.\n\nI really hope most of the parents have introduced the originals, though. They are a treasure. My husband was at the grocery store today and I was on the phone making dinner. There was a little boy about Kevin's age who come up to the checkout behind him with a small cart. He was wearing winterwear with a pompom-topped stocking cap. He put the separation bar down and my husband looked at him and said to the checker, \"Kevin McCallister\". She apparently gave him a dumbfounded look. He said to me he was waiting for him to take a Stouffer's Mac and Cheese out of the cart. (Yes, the mother was there, she ran back to get something.). So sad, a young person not knowing who Kevin is.\ud83d\ude31\n\nI digress...if you know you are going to hate it, then don't watch it and then b**** about it. Curiousity killed the cat but it doesn't kill the bottom line."

I will say this is not a good movie but it is worth watching once because they include a TON of Easter eggs that fans of the first two films will appreciate. From the music to certain scenes, there are plenty of them. Having Buzz make a cameo in it was a good thing but it wasn't enough to make this movie good. This will never be a favorite film of anyone who loves the first two movies but it is worth watching once. Even if it's just for the cameo and Easter eggs."

The story is the same as the original with all the chaos with a happy ending. The story connects with the original with Buzz McCallister (Devin Ratray) who portrays a security cop for the McCallister Security Company. Keenan Thompson acts the real estate agent who tries to help sell the out of work McKenzie's residence. The cast also includes Aisling Bea as Max's mother, Timothy Simons and the beautiful Ally Maki as the uncle and aunt as well as a brief stint by Chris Parnell and Pete Holmes. Overall it wasn't the best and I don't see myself watching it again, but it was an ok family movie that the kids might like."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've been a huge fan of Home Alone 1 & 2 since they were released in the theaters & saw both in the theater & have watched them every year since. Then they came out with Home Alone 3 & the last Home Alone movie to be released in the theater. I went to see it & I was so disappointed with what they did with the Home Alone series but then it only got worse when Home Alone 4 & 5 were released. They got increasingly worse as they came out so when I saw Disney Plus was doing a new Home Alone movie \"Home Sweet Home Alone\" I went in with the mindset that it is going to be as bad as Home Alone 3-5 BUT I was hoping that because it was Disney that they would put the magic back in the Home Alone movies & they absolutely did & I was so excited. Home Sweet Home Alone Is funny has a great story, great acting & I was so excited that they brought back a main character from Home Alone 1 & 2 & they make many references to part 1 & 2.\n\nIf you're a fan of Home Alone 1 & 2 then you will love Home Sweet Home Alone.\n\nLike Home Alone 1 & 2 Home Sweet Home Alone will become a part of my yearly Home Alone Christmas movies. Please ignore & skip Home Alone 3-5 & just watch Home Alone 1 & 2 & 6 \"Home Sweet Home Alone\""

And it wasn't funny when the kid kept hurting them because of their backstory.\n\nMeanwhile, there wasn't enough backstory or focus on the kid, they just grab like 2 scenes from the original movies for the kid to reenact and that was it. He literally had 15mins in the whole movie and that was it, and kid's character wasn't like-able. They didn't show him going through any type of emotional journey or having any type of character development, he was a flat character, basically everyone was.\n\nOn top of all that they just ended the movie with cheesy \"heart-warming\" scene.\n\nHonestly this movie sucks and I wish they could pay me for the time I wasted watching this garbage. I feel like the people who gave this movie over 2 stars hated the movie too but wants you to also waste your time watching it like they did, don't fall for the trap.\n\nDON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Macaulay Culkin set the bar very high, who else is going to match that levels? Macaulay also had Chris Columbus directing and a John Hughes script - so maybe Archie is better than this performance...\n\nEllie Kemper and Rob Delaney do all that can be done with a subpar script. I cannot say a bad thing about the fantastic Aisling Bea, she does her best too - hopefully the money from this will help fund her next self-written project.\n\nMax's Dad, Uncle and Aunt are unmemorable and insipid.\n\nThe score is boosted to 4/10 because of a special guest appearance :) Although we could have seen more of that guest!\n\nOh well... I'm sure they'll try another remake!"

This rich prick of a kid steals from a poor couple with a family, the couple tries to get their important stolen item back, and the kid basically tries to kill them (like in the OG).\n\nThe key differences here are the attacks feel unjustified and cruel. They are not in self-defense, they are out of ignorance posing as self-defense. It makes the movie incredibly difficult to watch. There is no balance in the characters. Sure, Kevin McAllister was no angel, of course, but his badness was outweighed and even made necessary by the evilness of the two Chicago thugs trying to rob his house and kill him.\n\nThat made all those gags bearable to watch. That made Kevin sympathetic and impressive, even though he was doing bad things. He was doing bad things because he had to and he was a kid processing a survival scenario the only way he knew how.\n\nThis movie muddled all of that. There's no balance in it. The kid is disproportionately evil in this case, and it doesn't matter that he does something nice for them in the end. You can't even make it through to that part (I had to fast forward). I expected better from Mikey and Streeter. I trusted them to remake this classic and do it justice and what a major let down. Now, I'll know to skip their next film.

AND WHY DID THEY BRING Devin Ratray AS Buzz McCallister AND MADE HIM LIKE THAT,The plot is the worse there's no character development. The effects are so bad too at night you can tel it's cgi. The traps are also so bad. Just an awful film. They just need to stop doing this, please, it doesn't matter if it's a disney movie now, with a better production, set, and people, it's impossible,FOR movie repeating the same thing from the original,Home Sweet Home Alone is a predicted disappointment."
