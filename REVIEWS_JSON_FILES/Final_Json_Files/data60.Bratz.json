        "review_detailed_main": "If you missed the ridiculously shallow ego-trip of Hilary Duff \"Material Girls\" last year, don't worry, here's another shallow teen movie for you that steals so much from Mean Girls that it hurts. The movie is based on the ugly dolls with the same name with perfect bodies and lots of money - only in the movie, the blond girl doesn't have any money at all. But don't worry, when she really needs it (for a dress), her friends have gift certificates.\n\nSure enough, no one would like to see a movie with a bunch of fat teens running around acting silly but did the movie have to star four slender girls with attitude problems? Because let's face it, these girls think that appearance is the most important thing in the world. They're seriously not much better than their enemy - Meredith. And by the way - how did the word 'brat' become a positive word? For me it's still a very negative word meaning that your parents have spoiled you.\n\nBratz doesn't want to give its core audience (small girls) a good message. It wants them to realize how important fashion and appearance is - and if you have an ugly outfit on - always make sure to keep a fashion emergency kit with you. Ugh."

        "review_detailed_main": "Let me be clear here first of all: I'm in my twenties, and I saw Bratz, but not for any kind of simple lewd intentions at gawking at sexy teens in gobs of make-up and slutty clothes. My intentions were a little more pure, on a movie-geek level. Or rather, I went in with the expectation that it *would* be a bad movie, and even one that would go to such ridiculous lengths as to be awesomely bad, to the level of something like Ghost Rider, where taking it seriously would provide brain damage, and by not would give some form of entertainment (especially if you have friends to make jokes with during the movie, which for something like Bratz isn't inappropriate to 'ruin' for the rest of the audience). It's a staggering, warped view of high school life, the connections made in 'cliques' and social order, and about the bonding between girls who can't get enough of talking to each other through their web-cams. It also has enough montages to kill a few horses, Jon Voight with not only a prosthetic nose but a statue of his head with the same fake nose, a fluffy dog who gets beauty treatment along with her owner, a mariachi band that lives at the house of the Hispanic girl of the Bratz (and, for some reason, this doesn't seem too out of place, especially when they show up at talent shows), and...Jesus, did I mention the montages?\n\nBut for all of this, if one is in the right frame of mind, it's hilarious, even achingly and hysterically, funny material, whether it was intentional or not. Frankly, I'm sure that the filmmakers didn't quite know what they were doing outside of making a big long commercial with the intellectual value of Tropicana fruit punch. But on those levels it almost works at times at looking like an unintentional satire; what is one to make of the symbolism of the heightened security at the high school envisioned by the school emblem and trophies: a hand holding an ax, with little figures holding the axes all over the school in one form or another? It also makes for some ample absurd moments when just seeing the four Bratz having a fight amongst themselves about sticking together or going off into their other interests (naturally, they have only one aptitude a piece, one soccer, one cheer-leading, one science, and one journalism/singing), and as well the diabolical attempts to thwart all of their fun by the nasty, less than one-note daughter of the principle, who goes for a 2nd super sweet sixteen party even after she's turned 16.\n\nMaybe if you're already quite a young girl, seeing this movie might not matter too much in the grand scheme of things as far as real psychological impact. But at the same time if one were to look objectively, Bratz's message is a little scrambled and quite off in any positive aspect. Does one stick with friends or act individualist or, um, like, go into another clique or another table? How about staying fashionable, in the glammed up style that the girls go to lengths to do- leading up to, of course, the Bratz mobile that they walk out of to the climactic talent show- even in the face of peril? It really doesn't serve any artistic integral purpose whatsoever either. So, in the end, it works best as a so-bad-it's-still-bad-but-uproarious treat for those who gorge on works that slip by in pop culture that are so sapped with the vigor of commercialism that to read through the mixed messages would take a pot of coffee and a fine-toothed comb. But along the way, it's got montages, and songs, LOTS of songs- which are, as one might imagine who doesn't listen to Radio Disney, the worst trash possible right now. Brattitude!!"

One of my friends became very still, and started attracting flies halfway through the film, and another one became temporarily quadriplegic from watching this! I'm 20... I haven't cried for any reason since I was 12, and this movie brought me to tears. Not from laughter, not sadness... it was SO bad, I had no emotions that could be connected to this film, and I just started crying because nothing else quite fit. If these people tried to perform like this two thousand years ago, they would have been stoned to death. The acting was so terrible, I think I lost my faith in mankind. The materialism in this movie was so... I can't even think of an adequate adjective to describe it... No wonder there are countries that want to see our way of life crumble... after seeing this movie, I almost agree with them. The MST3K guys would be speechless, watching this. It's so awful, no one could possibly lampoon this movie. It's too terrible to properly mock and satirize. I feel really terrible for the companies that sponsored this. They really lost out on this investment. The attempts at throwing in messages about individualism and inner strength would have worked, if there hadn't been the \"be yourself, but dress fashionably to be accepted\" message splayed across this film like roadkill. It's a good thing I didn't have any forks, or acetylene torches nearby... or I would have tried to stab/burn my brain out. I seriously considered gnawing my own leg off several times, to escape watching this film. I actually lost the ability to breathe after about 40 minutes of this film... I eventually remembered how, but it took a while. Not good... My roommate has completely lost his mind... he asks questions like, if Darth Vader showed up at our door, should we hang out with him, and some remarks about hollowed out breasts and orange juice... he's completely lost his mind.\n\nDon't watch this movie if you value your sanity!!!"

Obviously, those veteran actors of rich talent, Lanie Kazan and Jon Voight, have some sort of money troubles. For both of them to appear in this, they must have reached dire straits indeed! I cannot begin to imagine what financial crisis both of them face, but appeal to the Industry: Please- You all take up causes and collections for everything from flood victims to stray presidential candidates.

I see this film on the list, no idea what this movie is, but knowing well of the dolls. Thought it might be an animated movie or something else to keep us entertained. So I say \"F*** it we're watching Bratz.\" and we did. It's a Saturday night and we are juniors in high school - our expectations aren't high.\n\nTo start off, let me say that I know for a fact that this film was obviously in no way meant to be taken so seriously. I literally made this IMDb account just now simply to write this review for this movie. I see reviews of other members saying things like (a-hem), \"No-one would in their right mind would write, direct and produce this film, under the impression that anyone would actually enjoy it except for toddlers...and, unfortunately, that peculiar clique...young girls who actually assume that they and there friends are actually Bratz.\", or \"If you really have to put \"OMG\" as an actual spoken line, then I think it's time to rethink your career\", or even, \"It makes high school seem like a horrible place full of cliques and a mean, prissy, \"boss\" figure that runs the whole school\"\n\nMy God. You people need to relax.\n\nWe were all laughing hysterically the entire duration of this movie. This is literally one of the most bizarre things I have ever seen. But from the intentional overuse of predictable stereotypes of teen behavior/society in general, mixed with a good helping of clich\u00e9 'heartfelt' moments, we couldn't help from being amused.\n\nThe budget was incredibly high. It is undeniably a very quality-made/high-end film (cinematography-wise). So in that sense its also pleasing to the eye. Very colorful. Lot's to look at.\n\nIn comparison to a movie like Clueless, of course this film doesn't compare. But it is completely different. This is a movie about BRATZ DOLLS we are talking about. Bratz. As in, the child's toy. Expecting a Bratz movie to accurately depict high school life or common social interaction or whatever else you think it should have, is mad.\n\nHowever I do know that this is a film I will never forget.\n\nI will always have these fond memories of watching this astonishing film with my friends on a Saturday night. Being blown away by how outlandish it was, but enjoying it thoroughly as a fun movie night with friends.\n\nSo let's chill out."

        "review_title": "Smarter than your average doll, which is saying a great deal for this film",
        "review_detailed_main": "Bratz, based off the wildly popular line of dolls, is actually a much more tolerable film than the one I was expecting to be greeted with. Rather than a shallow, frothy, candy-colored stroll through ditzy women, inappropriate fashion, and immature circumstances, I received a mildly-entertaining, high-energy romp filled with attractive leads, all of whom at least carry their part with some semblance of conviction, acceptable, if scatter-plotted themes and ideas, and a pleasantly fun diversion through the world that sort of mimics our reality but still finds itself wholly trapped in cinema's, family-friendly kind of reality.\n\nMake no mistake, Bratz isn't really a good film and it wouldn't be the first thing I recommend your daughters see. However, for a film that concerns three teen girls who are obsessed with fashion and self-expression, we could've been handed a much more harmful piece of cinema. Even as a male child, I always wondered why so much outrage and hate was directed at Barbie, who predicated herself off of being a good-natured sweetheart, was always the subject of vehement feminist controversy while the Bratz doll-line went under the radar, with their skimpy attire, makeup-heavy faces, and distracting artificiality. You want to talk about giving young girls the false sense of beauty and exercising the gender roles? The Bratz essentially were telling them not to leave the house without a tube-top, eyeliner, and eyeshadow.\n\nBratz follows four lifelong best-friends - Cloe (Skyler Shaye), Yasmin (Nathalia Ramos), Sasha (Logan Browning), and Jade (Janel Parrish) - as they enter high school with an attitude to keep each other as close as possible. However, they are heavily burdened by the idea that the self-indulgent, wildly narcissistic class president Meredith Baxter Dimly (Chelsea Kane) wants to identify every student by what clique they should belong to, forcing nothing but social segregation in the already ominous halls of high school. Of course, Meredith finds the free-spirited girls disgusting and offsetting to her plan, but finds little to worry after two years of high school.\n\nYes, by junior year, the lifelong friends have become nothing but faces in crowded hallways to each other, drifting towards their own sort of cliques, falling victim to Meredith's plan to keep all students part of their own little class of people. Cloe becomes invested in soccer, Sasha becomes a gifted and determined cheerleader, Jade embraces her inner-scientist with the chemistry club, and Yasmin sort of watches it all happen, while quietly participating in journalism. Yet the girls are brought together by four colossal, incredulous misunderstands at lunchtime, which reminds them that they have fallen prey to Meredith's system. Upon reuniting the group to prove that they can still be inseparable and devoted to each other, Meredith sets out to destroy the girls by recreating the party she threw for her sweet sixteen, making it even bigger and better, which she hopes will propel herself to the known voice of the school while the four girls wallow in their shame.\n\nI laud Bratz for at least doing what I never thought would be done in one of the most ostensibly shallow teen films of the last decade, which is etch some solid, vital commentary about high school into its material. While many films have addressed the abundance of cliques and groups in high school, Bratz recognizes the problem with it, which is that kids get the idea that they shouldn't be seen with kids of different cliques, which stunts their emotional and mental growth all the more. Yes, Bratz would be better if it didn't make the cliques so overblown and farcical that they tread the line of being part of a high school satire, but its acknowledgment of a real problem in a pleasantly real way is actually heartwarming to say the least.\n\nThen there's the abundance of singing, dancing, and just hanging out these girls do, which is surprisingly fun and enjoyable, given how shallow it sounds. These are teen girls being teen girls, minus the sarcastic and childish lingo utilized on contemporary kids shows like iCarly and Victorious, but also without the biting wit and commentary of something like Mean Girls, one of this particular's decades smartest teen films.\n\nBratz essentially wants to be a flashier, more stylistically-potent Mean Girls, but its reliance on scenes that are too goofy and ridiculous to be taken seriously and its repetitive nature are what hinder it from living up to what it could be. The visuals are eye-popping, the music is catchy, if existing from the often forgettable subgenre of bubblegum pop that expires quickly, and the four leads are all charming with their smiley charisma and micro-mini fashionista sense, but the film simply has too much going on to really settle on a focus and it bogged down by scenes that are either not funny or heavy-handed in their moralizing. But the fact that there's moralizing in a film called Bratz, taken from the line of dolls that look the way they do, is surprising enough, giving the film much more leverage and likability than I could've ever imagined.\n\nStarring: Skyler Shaye, Nathalia Ramos, Logan Browning, Janel Parrish, and Chelsea Kane. Directed by: Sean McNamara."

This film was actually surprisingly popular.

The film in itself is about 4 girls who are completely different however, they still have a close bond, but as they go through school they get split apart by the things they like and within two years, they've almost forgotten each other. They vow to change however it's difficult and that's all I'm really gonna say, it's pretty corny but it's not bad once every so often, eh?"

I can't think of a worse film I've seen, and I've seen a lot of crappy films. The acting was rubbish and the actresses who are supposed to be 16 or 17 actually look like they are 30! And what I hated most of all was how unrealistic it was; it just happened that they could all sing, dance, and bake! And it so happens that they are all pretty. Whoever would watch this film more than once should be shot! Don't watch it unless you want to waste two hours of your life..."

One house, one family, 500 people.\n\nSasha: Apart of your typical \"African Anerican\" family. Divorced parents, jumping between living at both parents houses. Parents wont speak to each other\n\nCloe: Simple. Typical dumb, sporty, clumsy and ditzy, but amazingly gorgeous blonde.\n\nMeredith: Typical Blonde, Rich little \"daddy's girl\" who always has to have her way. And of course, leader of the Popular Group at school, with her brunette and ginger sidekicks. Oh yeah, also undeserving Student Body President. Yup, Daddy's the principal of the school.\n\nJade: Typical Asian-American girl with strict mother who over burdens her with academic work, Jade has to act like she loves all of it, but has a secret rebellious side.\n\nIf that doesn't scream American cultural movie character stereotypes, I don't know what does. And I found all of this out within I kid you not, less than 7 minutes of watching this movie."

My expectation entering the theater was that this was going to be the cheesiest and lamest thing since Josie & the Pussycats. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised. Many people are quick to review poorly, but you have to wonder why any self-respecting 20yr old would see this movie without children in tow? This is a children's movie. There is a time and a place for everything, and this movie has a limited target audience; it is aimed specifically at the teeny-bopper age!!\n\nI ended up liking it because it brought me back to my childhood and my own experiences with \"mean girls\" and cliques, and it helped me have a wonderful conversation with my daughter afterward. There is some merit to a movie that can touch upon a girls coming of age & self worth.\n\nI suspect that many bashers of this film are also on the Anti-Bratz bandwagon, and likely think that Barbie is the queen of dolls. My own opinion about Barbie is; If she \"can do anything\", why does she need her mother to have a baby for her? Maybe my own Barbies were risk-takers, but they loved the GI-Jo's in the neighborhood. Ken was a sappy pretty boy with no personality. I preferred the funner Dawn dolls and their ilk. Plus they were smaller, and more portable."

No clue what is her character name, they all are so plain, blend together, there no depth of the characters, that it doesn't even make sense to differentiate them one from another while watching.\n\nHowever let's not to blame these girls for the poor acting result. Without blaming the director! Well it seems like the director (Sean McNamara) is specializing on this kind of level movies. He evolved a bit with his another movie from 2022. And its only fair to mention that at 2007 when Bratz were shot he was less experienced so he might (definitely did) overlook poor acting, betting simply on high pitch voices, wide smiles, vividly sad emotions.\n\nOverall overacting, constant music, bad script and lack of logic in dialogues are simply destroying this movie.\n\nThis movie was probably okay-ish for mid scholl girls back in 2007. But nowadays its not classic, good or funny, its bad taste poor quality movie that has to be forgotten.\n\nUnfortunately I had to watch it against my will."

Bratz was on the bottom 100 when it was on the cinemas but still has a very low rating, which is fair enough. It had a very simple story that wasn't even told very well and I only understood it by reading it on paper not on screenplay. It was boring with many daft scenes like when one of the four girls was changing her clothes while the other three were covering her. Probably it is specifically made for girls but my sister didn't even like it although she is a huge Bratz fan. The movie was quite bad throughout but the ending was good & saved it and that's why I'm giving it a 2 out of 10. I can't say that it is the worst movie ever because no film can be worse than Pulp Fiction and Jackass part 1 & 2. The food fight scene was creative at start then was very funny. Most users either gave it a 1 or 9 out of 10, which means that you can either really hate it or love it but 10/10 means perfect, which definitely isn't. Overall I didn't like the film but I absolutely did not hate it as well because it did not bore me to death and I have seen much worse films."

If it was made for anyone over the age of 14 it would have been quite a bit different.\n\nAlso, If you are going to bad talk a kids movie because YOU didn't like it then hopefully you have some interesting reasons to back the opinion up because believe it or not people do use this as a judging point unfortunately.

        "review_detailed_main": "It's been a weird day. My air conditioner went belly up and I sought refuge from the 100+ degree heat at my local mega-multi-plex, buying a ticket to the \"Bourne movie\". After 20 minutes of that movie's self-conscious unsteady-cam filming technique I was feeling a little queasy and bailed. Stopping at \"Bratz\" to recover my equilibrium before seeking a refund and an airsickness bag. What I saw was a totally empty theater (zero people) just two weeks after the movie's release.\n\nI couldn't find much similarity between the teen actresses and the dolls (the dolls are all a lot cuter). What strikes me as interesting is not the content of the movie but the fact that it was given a wide theatrical release. The inventory of films must be pretty low if they have to send this anywhere but direct to video.\n\nAs already pointed out this is \"the single most shallow, insignificant, poorly-directed, badly- acted movie of this year\", or maybe any year. It also has about the narrowest target audience possible for a mainstream film, 3 to 9 year old girls with an infatuation with clothes, shoes, hair, and make-up. They must be serious girly-girls, your soccer and softball playing daughters won't find anything to relate to here.\n\nBut I'm not sure if the complaints about the message behind the film are really valid. It revolves around four multi-ethnic BFF teen girls who have nothing in common except their fashion trend value systems. Now this would be bad if the characters were played by beautiful young actresses in a school full of gorgeous likewise beautiful girls with perfect bodies. Which is what you expect from the standard pre-sold teen movie. But instead Yasmin (Natalie Ramos), Jade (Janel Parish), Sasha (Logan Browning), and Chloe (Skyler Shaye) look ready to pledge a dogs, pigs, and elephants sorority. For a while I thought I was watching an episode of \"Animal Planet\". Meredith (Chelsea Staub) was a pleasant exception in this school's bovine to canine parade.\n\nThey look more like four homely college freshman than hot high school fashion types and the student body looks just as bland. Whatever happened to the days when starlets got parts based strictly on their beauty with their acting skills irrelevant? Of course acting skills were just as irrelevant in these casting choices. Which leads to the obvious question of how a group of people so average looking and so clueless about the thespian profession happened to all wonder onto the set of this movie looking dazed and confused. The point being that no little girl is going to get an inferiority complex or suffer from an eating disorder because of watching this movie. The producers have unintentionally managed the positive message that no amount of expensive clothes, shoes, hair, and make- up can make an average girl look like a hot teen actress.\n\nSpeaking of wandering on to the set looking dazed and confused, Jon Voight plays Meredith's father and the school principal. Now I realize that the highlight of Voight's recent career is a \"Seinfeld\" cameo and his teeth marks on a pencil, but appearing in this mess is the equivalent of Bela Lugosi working with Ed Wood in the 1950's to support his drug habit.\n\nThe movie concludes with a loud and irritating musical number which I suspect was inspired by the success of \"High School Musical\".\n\nThen again, what do I know? I'm only a child."

        "review_detailed_main": "Why would a 49 year-old guy watch \"Bratz\"? Well, he could be a totally sick freak (I swear, I am not...though that's what freaks would say also...but I am not!!). But in my case (again, I swear) it's because I have a goal of seeing as many horrible films as possible before I die. I am not talking about run of the mill bad--those films I avoid. I am talking about really, really, REALLY bad movies. So, after seeing all 50 of the films on Harry Medved's amazing book \"The 50 Worst Films of All Time\", I needed a new challenge--IMDb's Bottom 100 list. While I have made a very impressive dent on this list, some films (such as the Turkish ones) are just about impossible to find with subtitles or dubbing AND they keep adding films all the time to the list (such as \"Bratz\" which only recently entered the list despite being released in 2007).\n\nI should point out that technically, \"Bratz\" is not a bad film in the traditional sense. The cinematography, sets, costumes (the the girls wear thousands each) and music are all very professional--so I think a score of 1 is unmerited--even if it IS a vacuous film. When I say vacuous, I mean that it is written with no subtlety and is designed for incredibly stupid kids in the 10-14 age bracket. Now if you have a valueless, undemanding and rather clueless kid in this age group and you like them to be this way, then perhaps it IS a film to rent or even buy. After all, while very, very stupid, the film is squeaky clean--as the corporate types behind this mega-marketed film know this would make the film non-threatening and acceptable viewing for this age group.\n\nSo why is the writing so bad? Wow...this is like shooting fish in a barrel! The characters are all completely one-dimensional and more caricatures than something written by a professional screenwriter. The nasty girl at school is 0% real--but so are the four 'Bratz'. These girls are all PERFECT and represent carefully coiffed images--sort of like junior Spice Girls. One is great at math and science....and hot. One is great at music....and hot. One is brilliant....and hot. And the other is great at sports...and hot. This film is about their fabulous adventures in high school*.\n\nNow I must interject something that really bothered me about this film. As I mentioned above, this is just a corporate attempt to further whore off the Bratz name. The Bratz dolls are marketed to young kids--very young kids. And, in a completely cynical attempt to be BOTH non-threatening and pretending to be inclusive, three of the Bratz are ethnic. Now I am NOT talking ethnic is a real manner. Nope. It's a CORPORATE style of ethnicity. The black girl has non-brown eyes, talks EXACTLY like any white kid and is groomed just like a white kid. The Asian kid is vaguely Asian and you only know that she is part Asian at the film's conclusion when you see her mother. And, the Hispanic kid looks 100% non-Hispanic white and speaks with no accent and throws out occasional Spanish words for no discernible reason. As for her family, like the actress they don't look or sound the least bit Hispanic (Lainie Kazan?!). When this girl and her mother sing \"La Cucaracha\", it is pathetic--with no accent AND they don't even know the words! But wait...they at least have a disabled kid, right?! Well, sort of. He's hot, does NOT wear a hearing aid or cochlear implant (they would be SO gross....ewww!!) and yet, inexplicably, speaks perfectly and seems to function 100% normally. In fact, to deafness, he's a lot like what Daredevil is to blindness!! I really think that the corporate-type schmucks responsible for this terrible film just think that REAL blacks, Asians, Hispanics and disabled kids are not stylish enough to be in a Bratz film.\n\nA few final quibbles. First, how did Jon Voigt get in this film? Does he need the money THAT badly? If so, I am sure we could all take up a collection to help him avoid similar mistakes in the future. Second, I cannot believe that the film managed to insert classical music into it--making me almost hate the tunes. Third, I know I am thinking too much here, but who would let the bad girl bring a dog to school? I know her dad is supposed to be the principal, but bringing along a dog (obviously a knockoff of \"Legally Blonde\") just shows bad writing (duh...this IS a bad film!!). Overall, I see \"Bratz\" as a vapid, valueless and crappy film with no redeeming merits. And, given its place on the IMDb Bottom 100, I can tell that I'm not alone here!\n\n*Oddly, while the characters all appear to be about high school age, I cannot imagine high school-age kids watching this one unless you drug them!"

First off, the cast has the same racial make up as USA for Africa with a Latino girl hanging out with an Asian girl, a black girl, and what I originally thought was some lost member of the Russian Aristocricy but ended up being poor even though she had a huge house and her introduction to the movie dealt w/ her enormous shoe collection: funny, a movie that tries to break down walls still has plenty of stereotypes. Example, the Latino girl lives in a house with 674 people and one car, the Asian girl is good at math, and the black girl's parents are divorced.\n\nThese girls are ripped apart by some bizarre social system whereby everybody gets placed in a group like it's Red China. This system is created by a girl who never seems to graduate. There is a sequence where the movie fast-forwards by two-years and this girl is still the president of the student body and running the school like the Gestapo. Merideth, the girl in question, is easily the worst character in motion picture history. Steve Buschemi in Airheads is Jimmy Stewart by comparison. Furthermore, unlike most movie that do not make your eyes bleed, this girl who spends 100 minutes raping the soul does not even get her comeuppance. Like if Michael Vick was named chairman of PETA. The characters are, sadly, only part of the problem. Saying the whole portions of this movie are unwatchable is untrue, b/c that would imply that some parts of the movie are. From start to finish, Bratz is a step by step instructional manual on how-to-whore-out-your daughters, but keep them passionate about friendship. Several scenes in particular are horrendous: like a Super Sweet 16 party equipped with an elephant that is so mind-numbingly retarded that I was sent into anaphalectic shock and needed as epi-pen to be revived. Finally, the real atrocity in the Killing Fields that is Bratz is its includence of one Jon Voight. Before I had defined the lengths people would go to pay off gambling debt or meet the daily \"fix\" by referencing Kenneth Branaugh as Dr. Arlis Lovalce in Wild Wild West. No longer. Jon Voight is so ridiculous in this movie that you have to wonder if the producers had kidnapped his wife and blackmailed him. First off, they try to sneak his name in the credits so unless you are paying attention you don't even know its him. Next they disguised him as if he were snitching on the mob, complete with chotch mustache which only ups his creepy factor b/c he is constaly checking out the Benaton Ad that are the main characters. In Brief, theologists have their work cut-out for them since they have to explain how any higher power could have allowed Bratz. Even non-sentient beings will be driven insane. Keep the dog away from chocolate while it's on. Terrorist you have been warned."

I played with bratz dolls when I was young and even had a few computer games, one of which was based on this movie. I have long growned out of the designated audience age but when I saw the movie on netflix I thought I give it a try.\n\nI was surprised to see some quite good actors in a seemingly horrible early performence. I give this movie a 1 star rating because it has no substence I could not enjoy it.\n\nHowever, consider that this movie is quite old and aimed at children, there was nothing else to expect. The actors where not given a solid script or plot to work out there full potential. They need to overreact and stay simple without any layers. This movie is supposed to be like this, for kids. A 1 rating for me as an adult. But if I would have seen the movie when I first longed for it (age 10 or something) I may not love it but probably enjoyed my time anyway.\n\nSoundtrack by the way... for this kind of movie surprisingly great!"

I think you'll enjoy the movie more if you realize that the intended audience is 7 - 14 year old girls, not adults.\n\nMaybe it would have been more well received by critics if one of the girls became a drug addict, another was in abusive relationship, etc. The movie was meant to entertain young children and it did that job admirably.\n\nIf you're looking for a movie with a deep plot, then watch something else. If you have a young daughter, especially one who likes Bratz dolls, this is a movie for her."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I was younger, I liked Bratz, to be more specific, their Babyz versions. I also remember watching the Bratz Babyz movie and loving it. However, today I'll be talking about their live action theatrical debut simply called Bratz. It's one of the lowest rated movies along with the Emoji movie (I don't hate that movie either) and for some reason I thought it was alright, nothing spectacular or extraordinary but it's fine.\n\nThe movie starts with our quartet: Yasmin (Nathalie Ramos), Cloe (Skyler Shae), Sasha (Logan Browning) and Jade (Janel Parrish) going to college and being best friends forever! However, one person in particular Meredith (Chelsea Stubb) is a perfectionist daughter of the principal who wants to sort our main girls into clubs, thus separating them.\n\nBut our main characters will still be together no matter what and that annoys the antagonist so much, that she will do anything to humiliate them.\n\nWell, the whole setting reminds me of Disney channel's High school musical, even the villain is too similar to Sharpay by being a spoiled rich girl with a puppy in her purse. However, the whole musical aspect happens in the end with the talent competition. The story is ok, but can be a little weird sometimes. Like in one scene the whole school makes a food fight simply because a puppy pulled Cloe's leg and she dropped her lunch on Jade and then the whole college throws food on each other with classical music on the background.\n\nSpeaking of songs, they were pretty good, especially \"it's all about me\" and \"Brattiude\". Sure, they are not as good as songs in Bratz Babyz (these songs were awesome), but both singers and composers did try their best and are actually radio-worthy. The actresses were not that bad either, most of them are actually teenagers (with the exception of Skylar Shae, who played Cloe) and they act well. I also noticed that the movie talks about some issues like parental divorce, money issues, deaf students and the decision whether you should stick with your old friends or follow your passion. Sure, they are only briefly shown because of the fact that this is a movie for preteens, but the fact that it included such themes, makes this movie better than it should be. Of course, it's still has fashion and shopping moments like usually in Bratz movies, but it's not really the main focus and it still follows the plot about friendship.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this movie to girls of 8-12 years, high school musical fans and people who liked Bratz when they were younger. But it's not for Bratz haters, so if you are one, then it's better to skip this film."

        "review_detailed_main": "There are some really awful kids movies, but this might just be scraping the bottom of the barrel. This has to have one of the worst scripts, dumbest premises, and characters who try to teach diversity through stereotypes. Only the very young can enjoy this, and everyone else will just hate it.\n\nSasha (Logan Browning), Jade (Janel Parrish), Yasmin (Nathalia Ramos) and Cloe (Skyler Shae) are all best friends and going into their first year of high school together, but at Dimly high school, you need to belong to a clique. Principal Dimly's daughter Meredith (Chelsea Staub) will make sure of this, as she hands out what clique each person will belong to. Eventually, even the four girls (aka the bratz) give in. A few years later, they are no longer friends, but thanks to a bizarre spontaneous schoolwide food fight, they become friends again. Now they must stop the school from separating everyone into groups and they must defeat the uber-popular Meredith.\n\nThis movie is filmed like a music video mixed with a commercial. There is constant use of slow motion, which grows obnoxious after one use, and the characters constantly stare at the camera up close, which looks like a mouthwash commercial or something. It's annoying.\n\nSpeaking of annoying...these characters....they are almost intolerable! Meredith, the antagonist is so ridiculously horrible to listen to. She must have no life, as all she ever does in the movie is try to make sure the school stays separated. It's like she has nothing better to do! Her super sweet 16 party is ridiculous, the song she sings is ear bleedingly bad, and her cronies are clich\u00e9d from bad kiddie cartoons. The main four girls are harmless characters, but they have such bad lines they become unlikeable quickly also. They almost act like they're five years old in their purity. Then there's the creeper character, Yasmin's little brother Manny (William May). He's supposed to be in high school, but he keeps hitting on Meredith's eight to ten year old sister. In a couple years this guy'll be asking for it when he gets sent off to prison.\n\nThe worst part of the movie are the lines. There is not a single interesting thing said by these characters, and almost every line is a horrible and corny line. The fact that a character says \"I've got the passion for fashion.\" is enough to shut this garbage off and throw the tainted TV in the trash. But it doesn't stop there. Most of the conversations here go back to my previously stated commercial comment. These conversations sound like one's from bad deodorant commercials or something.\n\nThis is just a horrible kids film. It will only appeal to little girls. Anyone else who enjoys it, well more power to them. For me, this is complete and utter rubbish.\n\nMy rating: BOMB out of ****. 100 mins."

The unrealistically active and thriving high school with people partying all over campus as if class never starts for them, and kids who care if four girls are sitting together at a table. All of these movies always depict this type of high school activity, yet I've never been to school where one beautiful girl calls the shots for the entire school. The clich\u00e9 of the popular girl trying to bring down the main character because she shows a sign of not giving a damn who she is. The glorification of being materialistic is too much, as this seems to be a trait of every female in the movie. None of these girls are really separable in terms of personality besides the \"villain\"."

Come on, you can't judge this like you would a movie for adults. So, for adults who have nothing better to do than watch children's movies and judge them as if they are Ebert, go get a life. For little preschoolers and elementary school girls, this movie rocks. I will give it 8 out of 10 stars. This movie encourages kids to step out and be themselves and to dress how they feel, regardless of what others say AND to set good examples for other people.

One word to let you able to picture the whole movie: DISGUSTING! For real, if these girls just want to sing, please please for the love of God, just sing and don't make any dumb movie!!! To be a little bit fair, I sense that they're trying to be kind of making a live-action from some kind of an animation here.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Bratz\" is not just the most atrocious film this year but it's a horrifying indictment of obnoxious American teenage narcissism. While I fully understand that I'm clearly 'like soooo' not in their demographic (sticking out like a sore thumb in the process, flanked by a handful of empty seats) but what is plainly opposable is its toxic value system that prioritises superficiality and pop music over its sledgehammer lessons of friendships and inclusiveness. Sprung from a line of fashion dolls that make Barbie look like an Amish housewife, the film tones down its creepy sexualised tone for quickie moral lessons and puerile considerations of racial identities.\n\nThese Bratz consist of freshmen high schoolers in Hispanic Yasmin (Nathalia Ramos), African-American Sasha (Logan Browning), Caucasian Cloe (Skyler Shaye) and Pan-Asian Jade (Janel Parrish). Preaching individualism through materialism and in a haze of noxiously pandering stereotypes (Yasmin's represented through food and music, Sasha teaches everyone a thing or two about dancing, Cloe's a pretty go-getter at soccer and Jade's a science whiz under all that face-paint!), the thing that's even more egregious is its condescension of young femininity under the guise of appreciating the gender. Considering its impressionable core audience, it commits such a cinematic sin when it is caught attempting to traffic in post-feminism while at the same time, disparaging it completely.\n\nConsciously cavalier and ironically insular, its entirely manufactured theme of abolishing cliques and embracing individuality is a tougher merchandise to flog than the titular skanky dolls when all it ends up affirming is the sorry state of materialism that is allowed to pervade even the most tenuous of idealisms. \"Bratz\", while never once approaching the subversion of \"Mean Girls\", would have been a fantastic satire if they had proceeded to cast the chasms of mainstream pop culture like Paris Hilton, Nicole Richie, Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan, that and if it wasn't so hands-over-eyes blind about its consumerist schlock peddling."

From the first 5 minutes of the movie I wanted to tear my eyes out from the extreme fakeness of it all. They way they talk and the things they say were so horribly clich\u00e9d and they made it sound so scripted too. And more and more clich\u00e9s were to come: such as the ever popular rich blonde girl with the tiny dog with her two dumb entourage.\n\nThe worst part was the talent show. I think I died during that scene and then woke up again when it ended. Somehow I wanted to block it all out in fear of it destroying my brain cells.\n\nSo to sum it up, do not watch Bratz if you have the tiniest bit of self dignity because at the end of the movie, you'd be punching yourself and asking \"Why did I waste 2 hours of my time on this?\" Oh and seriously, letting little kids watch this will not change the way they think about 'life' or 'friendship'. I cannot give them credit for deepness."

And Sasha's actor went on to be one of the leads in the Netflix original dear white people, another great show. Blaming the actors for something they had no control over is extremely unfair, it's not their fault, and unless you've been in acting you don't really know how much of a struggle it can be to get parts, so blaming them for being a part of this movie is really uncalled for. Of course this is no excuse for the script, which is littered with plot holes, but it's not really a movie made for adults, it's just supposed to be entertaining for young children, and when I first saw this as a nine year old, I loved it, and rewatching it as an adult is really nostalgic for me, because I loved the franchise as a child. This doesn't mean it's a great movie by any means, and being content for children isn't an excuse to phone it in on a script, but this is no where near the worst movie I've seen, and anyone who thinks that has obviously never had the displeasure of watching movies like birdemic and food fight. There's too much hate in these reviews for the wrong thing, because the actors aren't the ones who write the script, and it's ignorant to blame them, but who could expect anything else from people in 2007."

Their talent surpasses that of iconic actresses such as Bette Davis and Audrey Hepburn. Maybe even more talented than Hannah Montana! Their talent as young artists are immeasurable. It can't be measured even with an advanced measuring tool such as a protractor, or a ruler.\n\nEveryone who contributed to this masterpiece are all truly artists of our generation. It's times that this movie's fans mobilize to fight for the truth. I can't stand the Bratz bashing. This movie is brilliant. If only there was a way of spreading this message besides reviews at IMDb.com :("

It sent messages about both how you should be yourself and how you should be cool. My ears weren't burning, my eyes weren't falling out, but I didn't want to stay in the theater. Honestly, it's a toy I played with when I was little. You can't make a movie out of it. But they did a surprisingly crappy-but-not-sickening job. Yeah, the sets were cheap and stupid, the actresses were practically B-lists, and typically, played characters with as empty and ditzy expressions as their own, but it could have been worse. But I'd prefer you don't buy this movie. And that they never wasted it and ruined the careers of some of the people who worked on it."

Then the film has so many stupid scenes as mentioned little the hearing-impaired boy who listens to music by putting his hands on the speaker to feel the vibrations or like the one of the antagonist who \"humigates\" one of the protagonists by showing a picture of her on how she dresses in the morning...

        "review_detailed_main": "Another film I watched for the \"How Did This Get Made\" Podcast, \"Bratz\" is perhaps the most hardwork I've ever found a film I watched for that reason to be. It's unremittingly terrible.\n\nFour friends believe they will be friends forever when the arrive at High School, but their varying interests have them split into their cliques and no longer hang out. The cliquey nature of their school is fostered and policed by Meredith Dimly (Chelsea Staub) the daughter of the principle (Jon Voight). Two years later, the friends come back together after a food fight and decide to try and encourage cross friendships. Meredith doesn't like this, and tries to use both her sweet sixteen party, and the school talent show to beat the girls.\n\nI accept that I'm not target audience here, as an English man in his forties. But even then, it's impossible not to see that the film is relentlessly boring and shallow. It's full of baffling decisions, such as why the character of Dylan is deaf. I know representation matters, but it only is a very minor factor in one scene and the rest of the time he doesn't struggle to understand anyone, even when they don't appear to be looking at him when the speak. Even more baffling is the decision to have Jon Vought appear in the role as the class head teacher and to put him in a prosthetic nose. Why not save the money and cast a capable but less well-known actor?\n\nPerformances across the board are terrible, perhaps only with one exception. Chelsea Staub's character of Meredith is a very stereotypical \"mean girl\" but she at least imbues the character with some life and spark. The rest of the school are horribly wooden, and I couldn't care less about any of the our leads or what they were doing.\n\nJust bad. Often then \"HDTGM\" films have some sort of so bad it's fun aspect to them, but I come back again to my main thoughts about this film, that it was hard work to get through it, and I'd recommend nobody else does."

What really annoys me is how the Bratz are perfect at everything they do. For example, while trying out for soccer the blonde klutz (that's what they called her) is able to score a goal by pulling off a bicycle kick.

Lol if you've seen this movie, you know what I'm talking about.), but man, was it fun to watch. I'm sorry, but it's hard for me to hate this movie. I'm gonna be honest, most of the time, the movie is funny in moments that aren't really supposed to be funny, like The Room.

        "review_detailed_main": "Despite my indifference towards the Bratz dolls and disliking what they stand for, and disliking just as much the 2005 CGI-animated show, seeing as there are good examples of musical, comedy and high school films so gave 'Bratz' the benefit of the doubt with an open mind. Plus Jon Voigt has shown that he can be good if the material is (i.e. 'Midnight Cowboy').\n\nAlthough expectations were not high to begin with, 'Bratz' managed to not only be exactly what was expected but be worse. It gets points for some nice bright colours which stops it from being one of the all-time worst films, but that is pretty much the only very faint praise. The 2005 show, as very bad as it was, at least tried to incorporate some unoriginal but important morals and relevant relatable issues. This film also does both, but they are not just ones done to death in every kind of visual media in existence but they are delivered also with the subtlety of a sledge-hammer and in no way feel meaningful.\n\nThey are also further disadvantaged by the stereotyping, it's not just one or two aspects or characters that are stereotypical. Everything is stereotyped to the maximum, seeming like every one in existence, and in a way that make tea party saucers and very shallow water when swimming in the sea look deep in comparison. The un-subtlety is similarly applicable here as it is in the morals/issues 'Bratz' tries to show, the stereotypes are excessive in number, over-exaggerated and a few are not for the easily offended. Not in a while have more shallow and unlikeable characters graced any film by me seen by me recently, they all live up to their names as brats with personalities that never sparkle and instead make one depressed and they serve as unhealthy role models for the primary target audience.\n\nOther than the bright colours, there is a real straight-to-video/DVD look to 'Bratz'. It strives for glitz but ends up being pure garish tack with unexceptional at best amateurish at worst filming. The songs written for the film are repetitive and irritate fast, even the worst of the songs heard in the charts today are more tolerable than the songs here. They are also sung with variable sense of pitch, lacklustre energy and nasal, and at times shouty, poorly recorded voices that are far more unpleasant than the worst singing of Disney Channel stars. The choreography is lazy and danced with awkwardness.\n\nCalling the script stilted and shallow are insults to those words. It's truly cringe-worthy, forced and vapid, so poorly delivered and has no substance whatsoever. The story is non-existent thin and would strain to sustain even a half an hour television episode let alone a feature length film.\n\nAnd now we come to the acting, have not seen acting this appalling in quite some time. Everyone either looks like they are on autopilot or are so over the top that one feels ashamed for struggling to laugh out loud. There is no discernible chemistry between them either, with the titular characters it is hard to believe that they are friends with the way they interact and believe.\n\nOf the performances, Chelsea Staub as Meredith gives perhaps one of the worst performances ever. Similarly, once again (just when you think he couldn't get just as bad as his career-low-point, film and performance, in 'Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2'), Jon Voigt disgraces himself with an bumbling idiot role (that is actually meant to be an authority figure) overacted dreadfully, and no obviously prosthetic/false nose won't give you any dignity sadly Jon no matter how hard you try to hide behind it by looking barely recognisable.\n\nIn conclusion, lots of brat-itude but no style or substance of any kind. 2/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "Four lifelong friends Cloe (Skyler Shaye), Yasmin (Nathalia Ramos), Sasha (Logan Browning), and Jade (Janel Parrish) are about to start their freshman year at Carry Nation High School. Student Body President, Meredith Baxter Dimley (Chelsea Staub), daughter of Principal Dimley (Jon Voight) maintains order in the school by assigning all incoming students to Cliques. This includes Cloe, Yasmin, Sasha, and Jade who all find their friendship tested by the oppressive social structure.\n\nLaunched in 2001, the Bratz doll line while slow to start eventually became a major competitor against the de facto monopoly of Barbie capturing nearly 40% of the doll market. The doll line was subject to both criticism and praise with some applauding the ethnic diversity of the line in contrast to Barbie, while others were quick to interpret the attire, attitudes, and other facets of the line as promoting sexualization and promiscuity. Most of the criticism was written off and had no major effect on the line's success, and what hiatuses happened were mostly the result of legal actions by Barbie owner Mattel. In 2006, Avi Arad fresh from his resignation at Marvel Studios before the MCU took off, acquired the rights to Bratz to make a feature film based on the property helmed by low budget children's film director Sean McNamara and produced by Jon Voight and Steven Paul's production company Crystal Sky Pictures best known for production on the Baby Geniuses movies. The film was a massive failure critically and commercially and was even nominated for worst picture at the Golden Raspberry Awards only being beat out by I Know Who Killed Me, the Razzies made a mistake because as bad as I Know Who Killed Me may have been, it at least feels like a movie as opposed to Bratz.\n\nFrom the point the movie opens, the titular \"Bratz\" are pretty much interchangeable in terms of personality and really only distinguished by their wardrobes which are the subject of a number of montage scenes (which makes sense given the movie is based on dolls) and for the most part talk, act, and behave pretty similarly to one another. On occasion you'll get some cringey humor based on antiquated stereotypes such as Yasmin's homelife where it's basically bludgeoned into the audience she's of Hispanic heritage down to not only is her home filled with people, it also has a Mariachi Band in it....you read that correctly, and there's other instances just like this for the other characters. Things aren't much better once we get to Carry Nation High School (because kids love Prohibition/Temperance references?) where the student body is made up of broad caricatures that make up the \"cliques\" with your typical jocks, geeks, loners, and odd ones like \"kids who dress up like dinosaurs\". On occasion there's maybe an inspired gag such as a scene where Principal Dimley is reading a book called \"How to Run a Prison\" but it's so suffocated by the weight of the movie and its lack of subtlety that it barely registers.\n\nThen we have the underlying crux of the movie of \"being yourself\", \"don't let the world define you\", and etc. Which is a worthwhile enough message but A) it rings pretty hollow when you're utilizing broad stereotypes and caricatures and B) The movie spends so much time focusing on the titular Bratz \"fashionizing\" and \"accessorizing\" themselves it's comes off like lip service trying to disguise how superficial the whole thing comes off as. The 2004 film Meangirls handled this material much better, but that movie was written by Tina Fey and carried a PG-13 rating which allowed it to tackle the High School experience with more edge and wit. The movie is written by credited writer Susan Estelle Jansen (though initial uncredited work was done by Susie Singer Carter) and while Jansen has a successful history as a producer on the Lizzie McGuire series and even wrote the finale film, the writing of that series skewed younger and focused on Junior High students and a very polished version of Junior High at that. While there have been some movies that take place in High School that are PG, they typically play up the camp value or silliness because it's very difficult to address teenage issues in a \"family friendly manner\", and Bratz seemingly wants to be both a fluff piece and a friendship story and doesn't have the ability to pull off either one.\n\nBratz is a soulless product that looks, feels, and plays like a feature length commercial. From bland interchangeable protagonists, to over the top style and performances, to high school satire that's about as cutting as baby teeth, Bratz is just as plastic and artificial as the products it bases itself upon."

Every character could be described as one dimensional if you felt like being generous, the plot is just utter nonsense and everyone in the film looks like they wish they had invested their money better so they wouldn't have to be on screen. I know some people would argue that my standards for what a movie can be should have been lowered when I came across this live-action film based on a series of dolls, but aren't little girls people too? Don't they deserve the same kind of respect for their intelligence that everyone else does? None of the characters have any personalities besides whatever accessories their toys come with (so for example, there's a sporty one, a smart sciency one, a cheerleader and if I remember correctly... the last one is just clumsy) and it becomes almost offensive how broad the comedy is. This might just be John Voigt's worst movie. Yeah he's been in some real stinkers like \"Anaconda\", \"Baby Geniuses 2\" and \"Karate Dog\" but in how many other pictures can you see him with a goofy prosthetic nose while playing a bumbling comedic principal? I have this movie at home because I collect bad movies and this is one of those that's so bad you have to see it to believe it. (Dvd, January 6, 2012)"

As for the doll line, I am more of a Barbie girl myself. Yes! I am 22 years old, and I still collect Barbie dolls. I only love the TV show and the new live-action film that came out last summer. As I said a million times, I was shocked, surprised, and flabbergasted by the negative reviews I would see on the web. I thought the film was an excellent comedy.\n\nI adore the concept of friendship, even though some may consider it cheesy. I am captivated by the challenges that the girls Yasmin, Sasha, Chloe, and Jade encounter during their initial year of high school. I've been a fan of high school-themed films and television series since I was in eighth grade. I love it when Meredith shouts, \"You brats!\" It's as if the film's title would come out of her mouth. The Bratz's act at the school talent show left me in awe; it was remarkable."

However, this movie was obviously intended for a young female audience, and it works well for that purpose. The music is good, particularly the Bratitude number, there is not just inclusion, but appreciation of characters of different races and a first for a preteen movie, a fairly major character with a disability which is addressed in a positive way. Contrary to other reviews, I think this film sends a great message about friendship through adversity, acceptance of peoples differences and even the importance of education (through Jades science club and the scholarship). I recommend, just don't have unrealistically high expectations, remember it is just a feel good movie for young girls. Maybe it's just that I first watched it when I was 6 and grew up with the Bratz franchise, but having recently rewatched it, I might've shed a tear at the finale.."

        "review_title": "Surprisingly not that bad of a Movie",
        "review_detailed_main": "Every year, there are movies that look utterly horrible and actually ARE utterly horrible. But every now and then, a movie comes along that you are expecting to be so bad, so terrible, that you are ready to hate it before you see it\u0097when you do you are strangely surprised that the movie isn't all that bad, and it was actually kind of good. Every year has its surprises. Borat was last year's big surprise, and this year had three big surprises that came out on the same day: Underdog, Hot Rod, and Bratz. Yes, let me get it out of my system now. Bratz, the movie I was going to love hating, really wasn't all that bad. The previews promised torture to the viewers who were unfortunate enough to watch it, and I went to see it because I needed another god-awful film to dethrone Napoleon Dynamite as the worst movie of all time. But Bratz, a fun teen flick with lots of heart, strangely won me over about an hour in. It did the opposite of what I was expecting around almost every bend (although there is still that typical clich\u00e9 ending that everyone will expect from this sort of movie). Bratz features four relatively new actresses in the lead roles; Logan Browning plays Sasha, Janel Parrish plays Jade, Nathalia Ramos plays Yasmin, and Skyler Shaye plays Cloe. John Voight is also in a small role playing the principal of the high school.\n\nSasha, Jade, Yasmin, and Cloe have always been the very best of friends, and they don't expect high school to be any different. Scheming, spoiled, snobby, little-miss-perfect prep girl Meredith, however, thinks otherwise. She is the president of the student body, and she makes her presence more than known\u0097all of the new kids must come to her so that she can sort them in with their associated cliques. No one is allowed to make friends outside of the cliques basically. When the girls arrive, however, Meredith begins to fear that there could be trouble. In their freshmen year, however, the girls blend in with their own assorted cliques; Jade hangs with the science nerds, Yasmin hangs with the cheerleaders, Cloe becomes a preppy jock, and Yasmin is pretty much left by herself. As time goes on, the girls begin to drift farther and farther apart from each other until two years pass, and they are pretty much little more than acquaintances. Through a series of events, they decide that they need to be friends again, and they cannot let the situation with the cliques get in the way of their friendship. Meredith is pretty much appalled as she watched the world she created crumble beneath her, so she sets out to teach the 'Bratz' some lessons.\n\nI am actually kind of embarrassed to say that I liked this movie. It did, after all, teach some very good life lessons, it had really good songs, and some of the actors were halfway decent. Clearly the best among the bunch were Janel Parrish and Nathalia Ramos, who play Jade and Yasmin, respectively. They gave their characters life and they had loads of fun with their roles. Chelsea Staub, who played Meredith, seemed like she was having lots of fun, but she wasn't the best actress in the world. Also somewhere in the middle of the acting spectrum was Skyler Shaye, who played Cloe. While she did bring a unique personality to the character, she was very weak at times, but she was mostly tolerable, and I loved her character to death. The very worst by far in terms of acting had to be Logan Browning, who played Sasha. She was absolutely horrendous in nearly all of her scenes, although there were a couple where she showed a bit of promise. Very close behind in terms of the awful acting was the young actor who played Yasmin's little brother. He showed no skill at all, his lines were always forced and never subtle, and he always seemed devoid of any sort of emotion or energy. The supporting cast was all pretty decent, including the parents of all the girls and the all of the boys.\n\nAs stated previously, the musical numbers were all handled very well. While I couldn't stay during the credits because I had to work, I did love every song and I liked the directing very much. There were so many bright colors and funny moments scattered throughout the movie that I couldn't help but smile. This is another feel-good film the whole family can enjoy.\n\nAs much as there are positive things to say about Bratz, there were many negatives. Before the 'two years later' sequence occurred, the movie showed no promise at all. I almost got up and walked right out because it was delivering exactly what the preview had promised. The script for the introduction to the characters as well as the opening scene were very poorly written, and basically all of the actresses delivered their lines like robots. For some reason, though, once it hit the half hour point, things got considerably better and it actually seemed as if it was molding itself out into an actual movie as it progressed. By the end, everything was actually coherent and very enjoyable. In many scenes, the acting became a major issue and annoyed me to no end. Still, Bratz definitely had its moments where I actually saw a great movie shining through. It was very clich\u00e9 in some aspects, but in many others it tried something new and most often succeeded.\n\nBratz the Movie was full twists and turn, surprises and songs, good acting and horrendous acting. I liked the characters a lot, and the movie itself actually managed to be halfway decent. I was expecting this to be utterly terrible, but it surprised me in every category. Still, the movie is not without its share of flaws and it is far from perfect. 6/10"

Sure, it may be a 'kids film', but I think mum and I both agreed that this was a movie worthy of 10 stars.\n\nPeople giving low rankings should perhaps remember that this film is probably aimed at younger children who have grown up with the Bratz dolls.

It's about friendship and identity, not to mention its diverse characters for the time that this came out. Yes the acting isn't great, but it's a cheesy little feel-good story. Rewatching it now, it's aged pretty well in comparison to some other well rated films of the same time."

Yasmin's singing voice is so off that I died. Not to mention Sasha's too. Jade was the only who could actually sing. And the choreography is so bad that the girls look unattractive. I think the girls were awful influences on young girls. They wear way too much makeup for young high schoolers. Plus, Yasmin is absolutely terrible to Dylan. In the words of Yasmin, \"You don't sound deaf.\" There was so much wrong with that whole situation. Another bad thing was how clich\u00e9 the whole plot and characters were. The mean/rich girl, the jock, the cute boy, the annoying friends, the sports girl, the cheerleader, the shy girl who has an 'amazing voice', and the smart girl who has a, \"passion for fashion.\" The real reason I gave this a ten is because it's that bad that it makes you laugh.

Each of the main characters have a speciality and interesting personality which we can admire and even related.\n\nThe actresses are excellent, as well as side characters. This movie is very well-written and right-targetting young girls. No sex, no drug, no inappropriate things for teens. Everything here is so original and normal. Even kids are able to watch since this movie is based on animated series \"Bratz\" which has been critisized for being sexual due to its young girls' target. But the movie is different, each of main casts potraited correct characteristics of the Bratz dolls. The music is fun. The main antagonist is also damn funny and interesting. Its school life also gives inspiration to how a high school should look like. Also no inappropriate kissing scenes like usual teen movies have, that one of the special thing from this movie. But what I do not like here is the cast for Yasmin; she is beautiful, has good acting, but her hair is too light for Yasmin who should be with dark hair. Anyway, the girls did well.\n\nBratz is not popular at all in my country. I just watch this today and never hear the name before. I just realize how good this movie is for young girls. So inspiring and not boring at all. The comedy is also funny. I never expect a fashionable girl Jade woud have a crush on a nerd guy, but he is handsome afterall. The story of four girls which is representing the real girl empowerment without that garbage feminism manner."

Young girls would love a movie about this, with the good girls beating the bad girls.\n\nThis movie has some sweet natured parts behind it, including a deaf boy learning to appreciate music and 4 best friends reuniting and become a team again, teaching kids that best friends should always be there for each other.\n\nIf you want your little girl to truly enjoy a night out at the movies, then take her to see Bratz. in fact she doesn't have to be a little girl, she could be any age and still love the catchy songs and excellent storyline."

Oh, I Love You Guys! We're Truly Best Friends Forever\" And Then They All Shouted \"BFF! Even Better.. BRATZ!\" well, i think yeah Bratz deserves to get 10 for the ratings. but i DON'T think that Bratz deserves to get 1 for the ratings. so, i think u have to watch it. but if u will be afraid to feel ashame for watch it in theater because u stupid, then just watch the movie on DVD. and prepare to be amazes!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Look, obviously this movie isn't the \"best\" of all the movies that are available in the world. However, to a young teenager, they would have a very different perspective towards it.\n\nI'm a guy and currently in college right now. I first saw this movie as a class (we voted for a movie on the last day of sixth grade in 2008 and Bratz won, so we saw it) back in elementary school and I must admit that I enjoyed it very much.\n\nTrue, many may question the movie's message, but in many ways I see that it does project a positive message. Throughout the movie, the four Bratz girls (Chloe, Jade, Sasha, and Yasmin) meet events that challenge their friendship. However, they make it through putting their friendship as a priority. This delivers a very important message to young teenagers/tweens that they should always learn to maintain friendships and set how to aside their differences.\n\nAnother important message the movie delivers is basically how to stand up for yourself. It's very important that children in their pre- teens know this as it is very possible that they will also face similar issues once they head into highschool.\n\nLastly, this movie wasn't intended for adults or the \"general audience\". It was directed towards preteens/young teens in general. Many teenagers at that time (myself included) were very interested on \"what high school is going to be like\". Therefore to them, this movie would be very enjoyable."

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't understand why this movie has to be very low in rating. But I'm just going to be one of the optimistic people telling people the good side of the movie.\n\nFirst let's start with my cons. Nathalia(Yasmin) is the singer or the girl who loves singing....welll supposely they would have found someones voice that matches the way she talks more if she cannot sing. Including Skylar(Chloe). But none of them use there real voice except Janel Parrish(Jade). If I made the movie I can easily find people who can sing very well and look great for bratz...\n\nAnother thing why does it have to take them 2 years until they get back together? It would have took just a month for the better? I mean friendship is awesome but no girl in real life would split up because they are in different cliques,clubs,sports, or interest. Especially it can't take 2 years.\n\nOkay let me explain the pros.....\n\nThe movie is still good, the lesson is understandable....the lesson fits the point of the story, and is just a film that feels like an exciting girly movie. I enjoy this since I was a little girl. Those cons I said on top, I mostly wished it didn't take 2 years for friendship to happen again.It would have been less plus the story would have been written better like....\n\nMeridith saw 4 girls having a strong friendship but she becomes friends with one of them and lie about how one another hate or say things about each other and make tricks. Later on they find out and stop her.Lesson would be \"don't be jealous\"\n\nOr it would have just been a movie about competting against her in a competition and they try to learn how to work together and make plans to stay strong as a team. \"Lesson would be stay strong, fight to win , or enjoy the competition, if you lost no big deal\"\n\nOr another competition against dancing as a team or fashion just because thats what you always see in the animation.\n\nThe music and the songs is great....no one should not deny that.\n\nI found it very funny how at the end Meridith got embarrassed in her sweet 16th or her second one.\n\nI can relate to yasmin when she is sad and nervous. But is bad that the evil character easily persuade them to be separated just because she tells you to hang out in a certain group. But in real life no one tells you to hang out with people...that would cause a lot of chaos."

The girls all had their quirks without upstaging each other, and I think the actors portrayed the characters very well. My favorite was Jade, because her character seemed the most genuine and had the greatest depth. My absolute favorite part was the video that played at the end of the credits. Janel Parrish (Jade) performed a beautiful song called Rainy Day, which she wrote herself. It is on the soundtrack, which I plan to download from I-Tunes. I really hope to see a sequel."

Come on girl you could've held the microphone to your mouth! Chloe did have the best reaction during the song! Pure disgust! Anyways I did enjoy this though. I got to enjoy this movie with myself and then I got my family to enjoy this as well! So I'm glad this movie is here for my whole family to love! Just watch this movie!

It's lighthearted, fun, and carries a sense of nostalgia that takes me back to those carefree days. It was never trying to be a cinematic masterpiece-it's simply a movie for teenage girls, and it honestly holds up as well, if not better, than other films from that era that have received higher ratings. Watching it for the first time as an adult and then picking apart the acting, pointing out plot holes, or focusing on every small flaw misses the mark entirely. This film was made to be enjoyed by a young audience who could relate to its characters and story, not for adults to dissect it years later. Criticising it so harshly as an adult feels disconnected from its real purpose and the nostalgic charm that continues to resonate with those who grew up with it."
