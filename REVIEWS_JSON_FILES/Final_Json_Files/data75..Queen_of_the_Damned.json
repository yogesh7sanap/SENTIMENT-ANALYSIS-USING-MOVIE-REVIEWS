        "review_detailed_main": "As a fan of the novels and the movie Interview with a Vampire, I spent a good half hour yelling at the screen before realizing the following:\n\n1. These are not Anne Rice's vampires. Every character is different, despite their names (The only one to nail a character was Vincent Perez, the highlight of the movie as Marius. Good job.)\n\n2. The plot of the movie is not based on the books. It as if someone picked up a copy of The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned, opened to random pages, made assumptions, got bored and stopped reading, then wrote a screenplay.\n\n3. The vampiric rules adhered to in the books are not followed in the movie. The vampires just do whatever is coolest. A certain vampire can't fly? Why not? And why not give him a trail?\n\nOnce you have acknowledged all these things, you can watch the movie. Have fun. This is not heavy stuff like Interview with the Vampire. Watch Stuart Townsend dance around in a mesh shirt and tight pants, and applaud when his shirt disappears, or, if you like it better, watch Aaliyah gyrate in a scanty metal bra contraption. It's what these two do best.\n\nEmbrace its plot holes and stupid dialog (which lends itself to random quoting), sing along to the entertaining rock songs. Try and figure out what each of the ancients are named. Pride yourself if you can provide any explanation for what happens at the end of the movie, because \"trimming to help the pace\" leaves the ending fairly incomprehensible, especially to those who have read the books.\n\nBe sure to watch the extra features, the gag reel for laughs and the deleted scenes if you want to know what happened in the movie. Also try the various documentaries, which are entertaining when they throw in weird special effects while people are speaking.\n\nPerfect for a loud, popcorn-filled Friday night with the friends!\n\nPrindora (Eibzesii)"

I couldn't have predicted that years after it's release just thinking about the movie still makes me angry. The novels are amazing, and while I understand much gets lost in the translation to screen, this movie was a great big middle finger to her original work. I hope one day someone tries again, the right way, starting with The Vampire Lestat. They change the roles and looks of major and minor characters alike for no good reason. They destroy Lestat's history. The acting of the Queen is exaggerated to the point of comedy, but I just can't bring myself to laugh. The charm and allure of the novels just isn't there. The movie is a bad excuse to cram as many musicians and \"dark\" imagery as possible into one movie, hoping the teeny Goths of America would lap it up. Part of the appeal of the first movie, of Louis' story, is that he is caught between his humanity and his curse. Lestat is supposed to take over and display the magic and excitement of the vampire world. Thank goodness I read the books first, or I'd have never touched them after this movie."

First of all it's based on half the story (the book before it in the series \"The Vampire Lestat\" ended with the beginning of \"Queen of the Damned\") They left out main characters, omitted the histories, and even changed how Lestat became a vampire, what was left out of \"Interview With The Vampire\" felt like they just needed to fit into some time constraints, what they did with \"Queen of the Damned\" was a hack and slash job. Even taking it separately from the book, it was at best mediocre. The characters were two dimensional, and bland, and the plot was boring and unconnected. This movie's only redeeming qualities were the mood the lighting and the sets added, and the costumes, which both were wonderful, but besides that, read the book instead."

The man looks the part and he plays the part very well too. You can understand why characters are seduced by him. He totally oozes that kind of sexy rockstar charm.\n\nI know the movie is literally nothing like the novel, and it garnered a LOT of criticism for that, as well as it generally not being a particularly great movie even if you treat it as stand-alone.\n\nI tend to put this movie on when I fancy watching something a little silly that doesn't require an awful lot of thinking about. Its kind of early 2000s trash at its finest."

        "review_detailed_main": "If vampire tales are your cup of blood, then this Goth-fest based on the Anne Rice Vampire Chronicles should prove to be a satisfying experience. A veritable consortium of the undead in a contemporary setting, `Queen of the Damned,' directed by Michael Rymer, is a story of shadows and darkness, and of the unfortunate souls who dwell therein for eternity.\n\nThe vampire Lestat (Stuart Townsend), bored with a world that no longer excites him, has been `asleep' for many years; but suddenly, the sounds of that world he hears from his extended slumber change, and liking what he hears, he ventures forth to investigate. What he finds is a world filled with new sounds, a new kind of music-- driving and penetrating-- sounds that assault the senses and make him feel alive and welcome. And he knows that at long last his time has come, that it is time for him and those like him to come out into the open and face the world on their terms. Toward that end he becomes the front man for a band-- a singer and performer unlike any the world has ever known. He presents himself as a vampire, and very quickly amasses a following that extends far beyond London (where it all begins), and will ultimately take him to Death Valley, California, where he plans to give a concert that promises to be beyond anything anyone has ever seen or experienced.\n\nLestat is powerful, without question, but there are those of his kind who do not take favorably to the fact that he has revealed them, one of whom is Marius (Vincent Perez), a vampire powerful in his own right-- the vampire, in fact, who `made' Lestat so many years before-- and they are gathering, coming together and making their plans to meet Lestat at the concert. And they are not going for the music. But there is something else, as well: At one point Lestat has inadvertently awakened the `Mother' of them all, the most powerful of all the vampires, Akasha (Aaliyah), who is about to make her presence known to all, and especially to the one she has chosen to rule by her side as her King: Lestat. And at the concert, rest assured, Akasha will be in attendance, without fail.\n\nMake no mistake, this is Lestat's story, and Rymer presents it amid a setting rich with atmosphere and with some exquisite moments, though his film has less bite to it than say, `Interview With the Vampire,' or `Bram Stoker's Dracula.' He sets a good pace, and there are some scenes that provide some real thrills, but overall the film isn't as soaked in menace as it could be, or as much as one might expect. In the final tally, in fact, the amount of flesh that is incinerated wins out over actual blood-letting, though there is more than a taste of gore, and more than a fair share of lips and mouths dripping with the red stuff. There's some good F/X on hand, too, especially in the sequences that accentuate the speed of the vampires, as they move and hurtle through the air faster than the naked eye can discern. It's a decent job by Rymer, but he could have put more teeth into it had he played up the alienation hinted at by Lestat; as it is, you get a sense of his detachment, but not enough to get you totally involved.\n\nIn `Interview With the Vampire,' Tom Cruise brought some charismatic star power to the role of Lestat, but Townsend is even more effective, with a look and an attitude that captures Lestat perfectly. He plays him with a sense of acceptance, and under closer scrutiny you may even find a hint of remorse and longing. It's a good performance, and one that sells his character convincingly.\n\nAs Marius, Vincent Perez does a nice job, too-- he is, in fact, one of the strengths of the film-- though his character is a bit ambiguous; that, however, has more to do with the way he was written than with Perez's performance, which is quite good.\n\nTurning in noteworthy performances, as well, are Marguerite Moreau, as Jesse, a young woman too curious for her own good; and the gorgeous Lena Olin as Maharet, Jesse's Aunt, who ultimately plays a pivotal role in the outcome of the drama involving Lestat and Akasha.\n\nAnd as Akasha, Aaliyah is an absolutely riveting presence. What more can one say about her other than she is a gifted performer, with tremendous talent and beauty. And, tragically, she has left us much too soon.\n\nThe supporting cast includes Paul McGann (David), Christian Manon (Mael), Claudia Black (Pandora), Bruce Spence (Khayman), Matthew Newton (Armand), Tiriel Mora (Roger) and Megan Dorman (Maudy). With a much stronger story than the usual offerings of this particular genre, Anne Rice fans, especially, will be pleased with `Queen of the Damned,' a film nicely crafted and delivered by director Rymer and his engaging cast. By focusing attention on the drama of the story-- and the way it's presented-- rather than concentrating on merely providing some cheap thrills, Rymer has succeeded in turning out a true horror film that is definitely a cut above, and one that just may whet your appetite for more of the same. And that's the magic of the movies. I rate this one 7/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm notorious among my loved ones for my love of movies that most people wouldn't like. I'm blessed with a gift to appreciate them, I guess. And I'm also blessed with the ability to take movies as totally separate from their book counterparts. Die hard Ann Rice fans might not like this movie because it slams two books (The Vampire Lestat and The Queen of the Damned) into one to make a relatively short film. So, obviously, a lot of the story was changed or left out. Which makes it understandable why some were upset. I mean, come on, Interview With the Vampire was over two hours long, and it was the movie version of just one book.\n\nHowever, taken as it's own story, the movie is actually very good. Well, in my opinion. Stuart Townsend's portrayal of Lestat is wonderful. And it doesn't hurt that he takes off his shirt quite a bit (he has a really nice, defined, if lean, body) and wears leather pants quite a bit. He also has the rock star quality that is often missing when most actors play musicians. You can see how into the music he is. He also is able to project Lestat's arrogance and loneliness very well.\n\nVincent Perez, who plays Marius, also does a wonderful job. Though quite popular in Europe, he is sadly under-appreciated in the U.S. I can't honestly say that his portrayal was dead on (so to speak) because I haven't read any of the books the character appears in, but I thought he was quite good. (Another one that is good-looking, ladies.)\n\nAkasha, unfortunately, displays very few emotions, so Aaliyah didn't get a chance to really showcase her acting talents in her final performance, but she did play the evil vampire convincingly. Since she was said to be quite pleasant in real life, I'd say her performance was excellent.\n\nMost of the remaining cast were also enjoyable, if not impressive in their performances.\n\nThere are also interesting special effects.\n\nI loved this movie.\n\nIf nothing else, you should at least check out the soundtrack. The songs are well penned and preformed by a number of talented musicians. My advice? At least give this movie a chance. Despite the bad reviews, you may find yourself pleasantly surprised."

        "review_detailed_main": "Despite a few acceptable adaptations of the books' main themes, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED/THE VAMPIRE LESTAT did not stay true to Anne Rices's complicated story telling. The deep layers that build up all the characters were shredded apart to only their surface, if not a completely different identity. The chronological order of the major events in the movie seemed warped and uneven.\n\nHowever, there were quite a few things the movie did to deserve my rating of 7. One was that the film strongly captured the affect that Lestat (among other vampires)had to the public, especially young girls. The movie also did a fairly good job focusing on the importance of heredity and history that the vampires took pride in. The scenes of sensuality were also atmospherically satisfying.\n\nThe acting in QUEEN OF THE DAMNED was moderate, if disappointing. Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah have a surprising chemistry, though it only shows when the acting is at its best (not very often). The characters are nothing compared to the ones established in INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE. It also lacks the emotional intelligence of THE FEAST OF ALL SAINTS, which is a shame because Rice's Queen of the Damned book had that, and more.\n\nThis movie doesn't give all that it appears to be. The effects are dull and very disappointing. The extravagance needed in many scenes is not given, and the dialog is tiring. The settings for many scenes are not how I pictured them in the book, and I think that many of them weren't even taken from the story. There are only a few areas of incoherence near the beginning and middle of the movie, but it wraps itself up fairly neatly, giving the viewer a full story (if they had not read the book).\n\nSomethings that I feel the movie needed include a good original score (Howard Shore or Elmer Bernstein), instead of the mix of rock music; though I had no problem with some of the songs. Another thing that would have made the movie better is better set direction. The scenery was boring as well as unclear, which is important in a story that moves around quite frequently.\n\nOverall, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED was an unevenly disappointing yet somewhat satisfying adaption of the important novel. With a few simple changes, it may have been a very successful piece of film work. I'd recommend this movie for people who has seen INTERVIEW or have read the books, so that they can make their own opinion on the adaption."

He DID NOT read the books or know the character...is he illiterate?

Usually, when adapting a book into a movie the screenwriter usually cuts parts to make it fit into a time slot. In this case, they cut out so much and added things that never really happened. For goodness sakes, Mael was older than the man who played David and David is supposed to be in his 60s during this time. They completely cut out Louis, Gabrielle, Mekare and the entire story of how the Vampires came to be. Then the characters of Pandora, Armand, Mael and Khayman were merely extras and only showed up at the very end. They never even speak their names. And Pandora is a Roman woman, not Indian. Khayman was young when made a vampire, not an elderly man. Marius did NOT make Lestat and he should've been typed out of the role. Finally, Lestat. There is almost nothing right about Lestat. Lestat is a BLOND and was made by MAGNUS and had several fledglings, including his mother and best friend. Thats where he got the Stradavarius violin."

Marius, Lestat and Akasha were the main players (and Jesse of the Talamasca). Also, despite other reviews, I think this movie and the music was faithful to Anne Rice's portrayal and ethos, at least as I perceive it. Aailiyah was pretty good as Akasha, in places compelling (her first entrance and mini dance scene). The movie didn't capture the breadth of the books series but I thought it was a nice supplement.\n\nI'm a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice's style, sensitivities and treatments.

Lestat was almost murdered by his boyfriend and their daughter and abandoned in a bog, and he got out and decided to become a famous rock star?? the most iconic thing I've ever heard. yeah, the plot and editing were sloppy, the graphics aren't the greatest, and some of the acting is pretty bad, but I love this movie regardless. you know what the most high-quality thing about this movie is? without a doubt, Aaliyah (rest her soul). she's the perfect choice for Akasha, and she absolutely stole the show with her powerful performance. most people hated this cliched movie, and I see why, but I enjoyed it and I'll shamelessly watch it multiple times."

        "review_detailed_main": "Review: 'Queen of the Damned' is a horror film directed by Michael Rymer. It is loosely based on the third novel in The Vampire Chronicles series by Anne Rice. This is not you're typical vampire tale. It's a gothic and fun story and is not heavy like 'Interview with the Vampire'. If you're a fan of vampire lore and can't turn your brain off about the information on them, you might have a hard time with this movie. Although, not as bad as 'Twilight'. Lestat de Lioncourt (Stuart Townsend) is awakened from his slumber. Bored with his existence, he has now become this generation's new Rock God. While in the course of time, another has arisen, Akasha, (Aaliyah) the Queen of the Vampires and the Dammed. He wants immortal fame, his fellow vampires want him eternally dead for his betrayal, and the Queen wants him for her King. Who will be the first to reach him? Who shall win? While the acting might not be the best I've seen, the actors are portraying their characters in such an overly dramatic way that it makes sense still. Especially Aaliyah when she comes on screen as the Queen Akasha. You know right off that this is not a character to be messed with, and she will get her way one way or another. I do like a lot about this movie aside from the acting, such as the amazing soundtrack. Being made in the early 2000's when goth-rock was in the up and up even if for a short while. I didn't once believe that the character of Lestat was singing these songs because they all sound like distinctly different voices, but the songs were great. I enjoyed the overall story being told, but for it being called 'Queen of the Damned' I think it should have been her story instead of Lestat's. Akasha was very under utilized in this film. Overall, the movie had no short of entertainment and while it might not have been the tightest structure, the characters, soundtrack and story are enough for this to at least be a guilty pleasure when the moment calls for it. 3.5/5"

        "review_detailed_main": "I went to see this movie opening night because for years I have been a big fan of the vampire chronicles. I was expecting something along the lines of what they had done with the first movie, however, that was not the case. In fact, it seems to me, with this movie they did everything they could to distance themselves from the first. The script for this movie was nothing but trash. Some of the lines were so cheesy I couldn't believe what I was hearing. The acting wasn't the best it could have been and a lot of the scenes were so awkward that I laughed at loud. It didn't flow very well, and I'm not sure that someone who hadn't read the books would be able to identify the characters or have any idea of what was happening. Though, I went with a good friend of mine who is also a big fan of the books, and even he had trouble trying to figure out who was supposed to be who because the characters we so drastically different from what they were supposed to look like. They kept introducing new characters (which most they didn't even bother to name) before they had even developed the existing characters. They moved so fast that you weren't even really sure who you were supposed to side with. I would advise hard core Anne Rice fans to stay away from the movie because it will only upset you. Anyone who was going to see it because it was a \"sequel\" to \"Interview With the Vampire\" should avoid it because it was nothing like the first one. Anyone going to see it because it's a new vampire movie shouldn't waste their time because it was more cheesy then the sequel to \"From Dusk Till Dawn.\" I really wouldn't advise anyone to see this movie at all. There is no need to waste your money on nonsense like this. I'm just afraid that people will think this is what the books were like."

Jesse (Marguerite Moreau), who works at an organization that studies paranormal phenomena, investigates the vampires in London and finds their coven. The president of the organization David Talbot (Paul McGann) tells that they should only observe and lends to her Lestat's journal. Jesse learns how Lestat turned into a vampire by his maker Marius (Vincent Perez) and his first contact with the powerful Queen Akasha (Aaliyah), who is the first vampire. Jesse becomes obsessed for Lestat ad travels to Los Angeles, where he will give a concert with his band. Meanwhile vampires from every part of the world travel to the concert to kill Lestat. What will happen in Los Angeles?\n\n\"Queen of the Damned\" proceeds with the return of Lestat but is not a sequel of \"Interview with the Vampire\". Lestat is different and less evil in this film and Stuart Townsend is witty and funny. The inexpressive Marguerite Moreau begins and ends with the same pointless face. But the music score is great and the special effects are top- notch for a 2002 film. The death of Aaliyah in 2001 in plane crash is the sad part of this film. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"A Rainha dos Condenados\" (\"The Queen of the Damned\")"

On one hand, the movie was a terrible adaptation of the book with more plot coming from \"The Vampire Lestat\" than \"Queen\" and most of those were distorted or completely changed. However, I really did like the movie. I LOVED Stuart Townsend as Lestat! I think he captured the \"brat prince\" so much better than Tom Cruise. Just the right mix of arrogance and vulnerability. Not so great was Aaliyah's Queen. Sorry, but I think she was WAY over the top and her accent was really annoying.\n\nI do wish that the \"twins\" story of the book had been covered. I thought it was the best thing about the book. Since there is no mention in the movie, it is hard to figure out the plot. It leaves too many holes.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the movie for what it was and I will probably buy it if only for Stuart Townsend's performance."

An adaptation of the Anne Rice novel and a follow up to 1994's well-remembered INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED updates the action to the present and recreates the vampire Lestat as a rock star. The film sees him crossing swords with an age-old vampire queen. That's about it.\n\nEverything about this movie smacks of self-indulgence. There were qualms over Tom Cruise's casting in INTERVIEW, but Stuart Townsend (who he?) is a million times worse. His Lestat is a character you want to beat mercilessly with an iron bar, he's so smug and supercilious. The supporting cast are diabolical, the plotting is straight out of a bad episode of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, and I actually felt sorry for Paul McGann, so extraneous is he here.\n\nThis movie wants to be so achingly hip and cool and the truth is that it's a ridiculous mess. A mix of trite dialogue, absurd and poorly filmed action scenes and a great deal of badly animated burning vampires straight out of the BLADE films. I was hoping for Wesley Snipes to come and kick some namby-pamby vampire ass, but sadly it wasn't to be. Watch out for the rock concert invaded by flying vampires, undoubtedly this awful movie's nadir."

In a moment of nostalgia, I decided to watch it again and see if it was as good as I remembered it to be. It was not, at all. As someone who loves horror movies, this definitely misses the mark. Nothing is appealing about it except the soundtrack and of course, the beautiful late Aaliyah being the queen.\n\nThe storyline and acting is horrible and cannot compare to Interview with the Vampire. The main vampire, Lestat is meant to have sexual appeal and he does not. He's like a random extra they threw a wig on and told him to act sexy. Even Gary Oldman had more sexual appeal in Bram Stoker's Dracula. Most vampire films and even in books, they're meant to have an appeal and charm to them, which entices people to be around them. This was not it.\n\nI feel as though a lot of people based their review on the nostalgia of the alternative rock scene at the time and being able to see Aaliyah, as she was one of the most popular musicians of the late 90s/early 2000s. It's a movie in a time capsule basically. Other than that, for what the movie is, it's actually horrible. You know it is, and it is okay to say that. This is definitely one of those movies you watch again in 20 years to reminisce and remind yourself why it sucked."

        "review_detailed_main": "QUEEN OF THE DAMNED\n\nAspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)\n\nSound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS\n\nAt the end of the 20th century, the vampire Lestat (Stuart Townsend) rises from his undead slumber and adopts the guise of a rock star, which draws the attention of a beautiful vampiress (Aaliyah) who wants to conquer the world...\n\nForsaking the introspective melancholy of its highbrow predecessor (INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE: THE VAMPIRE CHRONICLES), this ill-conceived sequel plays like a Gothic MTV fantasy with delusions of grandeur. But what grandeur! Combining elements from two of Anne Rice's celebrated 'Vampire Chronicles' ('The Vampire Lestat' and 'Queen of the Damned'), the narrative is anchored by Townsend's ultra-sexy turn as anti-hero Lestat. Flamboyant without ever seeming camp, he strikes a more dynamic figure than Tom Cruise's foppish blade in the previous film, and it's all too appropriate that he should locate himself within the modern music industry, with its outlandish characters and overzealous visual style (several of Lestat's music videos - inspired by German expressionist cinema of the 1920's - are convincing down to the last detail). However, while most of the songs - co-written by Richard Gibbs and KoRn vocalist Jonathan Davis - encapsulate the spirit of Lestat's heartbroken worldview, their aggressive fatalism will alienate some viewers and date the movie pretty quickly.\n\nAs in the original, director Michael Rymer (IN TOO DEEP) downplays the homoerotic undercurrent which forms a significant aspect of Rice's literary style. Nevertheless, the script - written by Scott Abbott (INTRODUCING DOROTHY DANDRIDGE) and Michael Petroni (THE DANGEROUS LIVES OF ALTAR BOYS) - actively celebrates the 'outsider' lifestyle (vampires, Goths, rock fans, members of secret societies, etc.) and tips a knowing wink to the initiated when Lestat exhorts his fellow vampires to: \"Come out, come out, wherever you are!\" Aaliyah makes the most of her extended cameo as the Queen of the Damned - she even manages to steal some of Townsend's erotic thunder! - and her final sequence includes one of the most visually stunning vampire disintegrations ever captured on film. Sadly, the singer-actress died in a plane crash shortly after completion of principal photography. Also starring Vincent Perez (THE CROW: CITY OF ANGELS) and Lena Olin (ROMEO IS BLEEDING) in secondary roles."

        "review_detailed_main": "I remember all the hype around this movie when Aaliyah was killed. Being a fan of Ms. Rice's novels, my first thought was \"how can they do Queen Of The Damned without doing Vampire Lestat first?\"\n\nHaving finally seen the movie, now I can see how they did it. If you have read these books, imagine taking out the gory parts from Vampire Lestat, cramming Marcus and Marius into one character, and removing everything to do with Lestat's beginning (the wolf hunt, his violin playing, the Theatre Of The Vampires, and also Louis, Claudia, and Gabrielle), then in the last 15 minutes cramming in Queen Of The Damned.\n\nWhat we loose is a very important piece of Lestat's character. His inner agony of having to kill to live, the fact that he carefully tries to select killers as his victims, and his love-hate relationship with Louis, Armand, Gabrielle, and all the other vampires.\n\nAlso important to the story is that we loose the \"Story Of The Twins\", which is the Genesis of Ms. Rice's vampires. And while I am sure the cannibalism was to intense for showing on the screen, they could have done something closer, and showed us more of ancient Egypt.\n\nEven worse, we have this love interest thrown in between Jessie and Lestat. The Vampire Chronicles is basically an American Yoni story. For those that do not know, Yoni is another form of Hentai (Japanese Porn Comics). But in Yoni, it is about gay male relationships, told by a female. While I am sure many men object to the \"gayness\" of the characters, in this movie they went to the far extreme the opposite way. For instead of Lestat persueing killers, he goes after young female groupies.\n\nAnd the other flaws in logic and storyline are vast. At the beginning Lestat emerges from a century long sleep, then later on asks Marius how he made it through the 1950's in red velvet. Marius has no idea who Elvis is, and says he slept through that period. Makes you wonder how Lestat knows about 50's fashion and music, since he slept through the same time period himself. And nothing is ever even mentioned about Louis, Claudia, or Gabrielle. I think that is a huge shame. Is like seeing \"Snow White and the 3 Dwarfs\".\n\nOverall, the movie I thought was really bad. About the only good thing about it was the soundtrack. Most of the acting was poor, the accents drove me up the wall, and all of the really in-depth parts of the book were removed, leaving us only with a hollow shell, kind of like Enkil after he was sucked dry.\n\nIf you want to see a good modern vampire movie, get Lost Boys, the original Interview With A Vampire, or even some old episodes of Dark Shadows. Let this one Rest In Piece, with a stake through the heart, cloves of garlic around the neck, and a vial of Holy Water in the mouth.\n\nIn ending, remember that before Aaliyah was killed, this was intended to go straight to video, no theatrical release was planned. It is obvious now why this was. It is only sad that somebody as talented as she will be remembered for this dog of a movie, instead of something where she really might have shined.\n\nI rate this a 2 on a scale of 1-10."

The backdrop of the gothic/heavy metal music industry brings an extra facet into this movie and in a way modernises the whole way I look at these blood guzzling brutes.\n\nA convincing performance by many of the cast members adds to the alure of the film and hopefully (although not being a huge fan of gothic music myself), will lead to this style of music coming to the fore in future soundtracks of this sort. I would encourage all moviegoers to give this one a watch, if not for the storyline then certainly for the moving and inspiring musical content, and the thought provoking backtones to this film."

I'm still impress of this movie after 3 years, I watch with interes again and again from start to the end. The acting, special effects and the music are more than 10(exellent).If you dissociate the fact that this is a horror movie and the actors are vampires this is the most beautiful love story I have ever seen. One more time CONGRATULATIONS for this wonderful imagination."

        "review_detailed_main": "Alright, most of the bad reviews are linked to the fact that this movie isn't an attempt by a studio to duplicate a single Rice book on film. However, this film takes some of the more interesting aspects of two Rice books and uses those elements as the basis of a movie. If someone made accurate movie representations of \"The Vampire Lestat\", and \"Queen of the Damned,\" and then released a two-hour enhanced highlights feature that described both movies, this movie would be the highlights version. Fans of the books will remember that Lestat was a kind of musical trickster who didn't agree with how he was described in IV, and this movie shows a completely different aspect of his character, while at the same time introducing viewers to some of the more interesting characters in Rice's Chronicles. Aaliyah, Townsend, Moreau, Perez and especially Lena Olin all managed to use their screen time to create memorable and mostly genuine representations of Rice's characters, which wasn't easy in a movie that as as free-form as this one. I think people who watch this movie will be drawn to Rice's books in an effort to better understand these characters, instead of the other way around, and that's not a bad thing."

This plot-line isn't helped much by a sub-plot involving a mortal who is entranced by a diary written by Lestat 200 years earlier and who now wants to know everything, at any cost.\n\nNot worth watching, even for die-hard KoRn and Jonathan Davis fans who want to hear his innovative and incredible score and songs (sense the sarcasm folks).

This approach mightn't be all that bad, if only Queen Of The Damned didn't do it all in such a lame and predictable manner.\n\nStuart Townsend takes over the character of Lestat from Tom Cruise and delivers a weak central performance lacking the star power and charisma vital for the role; his pale boyish looks would certainly not earn him the respect of hardcore nu-metal fans. As ineffectual as Townsend's turn as Lestat is, however, it is nowhere near the worst thing about the film: the pacing is dreadfully slow, the dialogue is dreary, the direction lacks the sumptuous detail and elegance that Neil Jordan gave Interview, and the less said about Aaliyah's awful performance as Akasha the better (suffice to say that even the way she walked annoyed the hell out of me)."

The cool Lt Cosello (Miami vice) acting style is done in true 80's fashion. The concert, with the flames in it, reminded me of Blade Runner. A lot of style, but all vampire films become redundant.

How anyone who knows anything about the original _good_ story line can rate this above a 3, I just cannot understand. Not only was the entire story line way off base from the books (since about half of the movie was from \"The Vampire Lestat\"), and thus the entire series, but there were even parts that ruined the entire theories behind vampires themselves that Anne Rice put into all her books. The defamation of the characters is one thing, the omission of extremely important characters is terrible also in itself, but undermining the entire vampire persona is simply inexcusable. I truly feel sorry for all of Aaliyah's fans that had to see her for the final time in this terrible film.

I would say more, but as you can see, I've said about all I can while staying as polite as possible.\n\nPlease, if you know anything about the Vampire Chronicles (and not just the movie version of \"Interview with a Vampire\"), do yourself a favor, and stay sane by refusing to watch this film."

It's a shame too because it's a fantastic cast that is totally wasted. Stuart Townsend (\"About Adam\") one of the sexiest screen presences in many years, plays Lestat as if he were impersonating Larry Hagman doing J.R. Ewing. I suppose the reason for his performance is shame about accepting money for it. He looked as if he couldn't wait for this movie to wrap. Victor Perez, another fine actor with enormous sex appeal who was devastatingly touching and heroic in \"Indochine\" seems equally embarrassed to be in this turgid mess. The homo-erotic connection between Lestat and Marius in Rice's novel of the same name might have been powerfully kinetic in the hands of these two sexy actors, but this movie cares more about admittedly stunning special effects showing bodies self-immolating. Akasha's hand in that is explained in the novel but not here, nor is Jesse's fascination with Lestat ever explained, or the reason for the Talamasca or the importance of Maharet (played by the always wonderful Lena Olin). These are important recurring themes in Rice's vampire chronicles that drove the novel, \"Queen of the Damned.\" Without them, the final coupling of Jesse and Lestat makes no sense at all or anything else, come to think of it. If Ann Rice was upset about Tom Cruise playing Lestat, I can't imagine what she thinks about this mess."

To make the novel into a two hour movie is a really BIG ask. To release it as this \"tragedy\", well.\n\nThe origin of Lestat is completely wrong (as any Anne Rice fan will tell you.)\n\nThe back story of Akasha and Maharet was completely neglected. How and why did they become what they become? I know, let's not tell the viewer and let them work it out!\n\nStuart Townsend as Lestat was okay, but he could only play with what he got. The major vampires from the story were delegated to \"background\" characters - Armand, Pandora, Khayman and Mael. And just where the hell was Louis???\n\nAaliyah was surprising as Akasha, although I still believe someone unknown should have played the role; much goes the some for all of the characters.\n\nJesse however was not turned into a vampire by Lestat, but by her Aunt Maharet after having her neck broken at the concert during a crowd crush.\n\nAnd they completely forgot that Maharet had a twin - Miriam - but that should have been covered in the \"back story\".\n\nIf they were to make a decent adaptation for this book as a movie, it would be close to four hours long, if not over. So I can see why they cut a majority of the story for a two hour movie.\n\nI just hope that some day, that Anne Rice's \"The Vampire Chronicles\" will be remade as it should be - a mini-series for each novel. Yes including The Vampire Lestat. But I can see that won't happen none to soon.\n\nIt might have been better not to have made the books into movies at all. After all, Anne Rice's descriptive style made the reader imagine vividly what the characters were going through.\n\nCompletely disappointed."

If I had paid to see this movie, I would want my money back. This has to be one of the worst adaptations I have ever seen.\n\nFor those who have not read the book and/or are not Anne Rice fans: if you really want to see it, don't expect much from the script or from Aaliyah's acting. The story seems very shallow and skips around without really giving any character or situation any depth. The movie has a bright spot with songs from Jonathan Davis of Korn, Godhead, Deftones, and more.\n\nFor those Anne Rice fans: Do not see this movie unless you want to walk away mad and with your head shaking. The fact that they changed so much from the book is astounding. Let me give you some examples. Lestat has brown hair and eyes. Maharet does not have red hair, but luckily Jesse does. There is no Legend of the Twins, and there are no twins- just Maharet. The origin of the vampires is not told or even hinted at. Louis, Gabriel, and Daniel are omitted from the movie. Marius makes Lestat and teaches him all about being a vampire (but in Interview, weren't we told Lestat learned nothing from his maker? Hum.) Marius is never trapped in ice. Jesse longs to become a vampire and it is Lestat who turns her into one, she is never injured. Armand has a minute of screen time, in which he is a blond haired fop. When Akasha massacred, they were men and women. There is no \"female liberation\" is this movie. David Talbot is young. Akasha kills Pandora by making her burst into flames. Akasha dies when Lestat, Armand, Maharet suck her dry and because Maharet got the last drop, she is now stone.\n\nIn addition to all this, the opening credits and first 10 minutes or so are pure cheese. The theater was laughing at its corniness. Other scenes seem silly, though they were not intended to be this way. Lestat lacks the fire and cockiness that Tom Cruise's character possessed. Every character is a very watered down version of what they should be. It was also just so lovely to hear Aaliyah speak every word with a Dracula accent.\n\nBasically, if you are going to spend any money on Queen of the Damned, spend it on the soundtrack, not this butchered, Hollywood version of a great book."

It made me a fan of Deftones and Korn and I was already a fan of Aaliyah. This movie is a mixed bag. Unfortunately, it is a sequel to Interview With The Vampire, with the lead, Lestat, being recast. I can see how his casting & his drastic difference from Tom Cruise would push people away. For me, I originally saw it as a standalone movie not knowing it was a sequel. And as a movie by itself, it's entertaining if nothing else. The story is a bit slow, and I honestly thought Aaliyah was in it way more than she actually is. Not a perfect adaptation of its book, but it is a good early 2000s goth/rock vampire infusion with the best bathtub kiss scene you'll ever watch. The effects do not hold up though, but i mean it's a product of its time. Go in with an open mind and you might enjoy yourself."

So I looked at what else came out around that era in the same theme - supernatural / horror / lower budget Resident Evil Dog Soldiers Below Cabin Fever Thirteen Ghosts Donnie Darko\n\nNo, these seem ok. So what went wrong?\n\nI have not read the books, so I have nothing to compare the story against and be disappointed. This was just bad writing, acting, dialogue, special effects, production, casting, hair and makeup. I would include costumes as well if Aliyah's outfits were not as amazing as they were.\n\nI think the real difference with this movie is you can tell it was written by a TV writer of the time. At best it is a B-grade movie that should have been released direct to video. I have no idea how this made it to the cinema?"

I thought the whole concept of LeStat the Rock n Roll vampire holding a press conference to announce that he his a real vampire and challenging other Vampires to \"come out, come out where ever you are\" was as stupid as it sounds. and when the lady at the press conference asked him \"how others in the vampire community felt about him announcing that he is real vampire.\" and so seriously nodded her head as if it were totaly normal and vampire were some form of ethnic group--that whole sceen was an insult to the inteligence of the average movie goer.- and if the Rock n Roll vampire thing wasnt bad enough the writers added a ancient Egyptian Vampire God-Queen to the story who just worders around killing people and vampires both just because she can. (one sceen shows the beach in California and she has killed everyone on the beach looks like 200 bodies).

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Queen of the Damned\" is a decent sequel in it's own right to a decent original.\n\n**SPOILERS**\n\nArriving in London, Lestat de Lioncourt, (Stuart Townsend) uses his musical group to force out long-dead vampires from their resting place. Due to the occasion, paranormal researcher Jessica Reeves, (Marguerite Moreau) begins to see that his lyrics on based on occult history about vampires, indicating he really is a vampire. Going into his past, she learns of the connection he had with Marius de Romanus, (Vincent Perez) the vampire who created him, and with Queen Akasha, (Aaliyah) a vampire queen who rules over the breed. Realizing that his music has forced her resurrection and unleashed a torrent of death and destruction, she races to make him understand what's going on before she gets to him.\n\nThe Good News: This was a lot better than expected. In general practice, the last half of this one is it's best scenes, since it's got all the action scenes in the film. All of them are quite enjoyable as well, which makes for just as much fun. The concert scene here is the absolute best part here, taking up a rather significant portion of time to a fun concept, as there is specific songs that go through and once the vampires get involved up on-stage, it turns into a great action scene where, using the surroundings and wire-fu, manages to defeat the in front of the crowd who feels that they're merely putting on an act. Once the fire reigns down, it just cements the fun. The bar sequence, immediately after the resurrection is also really good since the fire gag makes it incredibly entertaining and just fun, as is the initial resurrection sequence. In the beautifully Gothic basement, complete with stone statues in a great setting, the musical keys for the resurrection are great and the clues that it's happened, in the form of a great series of really nice shock images in rapid-fire sequences, allowing for some wonderful moments and making it feel really creepy. The finale is excellent as well, as there's also the nicely erotic, but non-nudity bath sequence also make this fun. That it also does a nice job with the back-story of the lead vampire, especially in the montage throughout art history coming off the best, make it effective and nicely done. These here are the film's good points.\n\nThe Bad News: There wasn't a whole lot really wrong with this. One of the biggest issues is really just the fact that the vampire isn't very threatening. Remove the vampire aspect from any of these creatures and they become whiny Goth people who do nothing but mourn and whine all film long, either about the betrayal of vampire lore, lost loves or about finding out the past. It really makers them seem like complete weaklings rather than creatures which command fear. The fact that it's the major leads in this who do that are all the more reason to be apprehensive about it, as they're the ones spending the most amount of time and are just completely not that exciting or interesting. The brooding Goth doesn't make for good threatening vampires, and this one proves it. The other real flaw to this is the lack of blood and gore. This one has a rather healthy body count, gets a couple of really brutal deaths and some wonderful set-ups for gore, but nothing else about this really stands out because of the fact that it's just not bloody. The opportunity is there, but we get nothing more than neck bites for the majority of the kills, which isn't all that gory. A little more variety for these would've helped out tremendously. Overall, these are the film's problems.\n\nThe Final Verdict: Not nearly as terrible as imagined but with a couple of incredibly damaging flaws, this one barely manages to become watchable at worst. Give it a shot if you're a fan of the first one or the book series, in the mood for a mainstream vampire take or plain interested, otherwise heed caution on it.\n\nRated R: Graphic Violence and Language"

If you pretend that the only thing in common are a few of the plot ideas and the names then I'm sure it's a half decent vamp flick. I've actually not seen a book so butchered before.

And then there's a human girl, Jesse Reeves (Marguerite Moreau) in love with Lestat...\n\nThe film really works. It has two great scary moments--one when Lestat attacks and kills two girls and a fantastic, violent vampire vs. vampires at a Death Valley concert. Great special effects, flashy camerawork (love how they show the vampires flying), some good acting but the plot has serious problems. There's way too much for one movie and there are obvious cuts in the film (I'm guessing for time) that render the last section incomprehensible. I was able to (sort of) follow it but it ruins what could have been a really great vampire film.\n\nStuart Townsend looks good as Lestat (a definite improvement over Tom Cruise) but his acting is only so-so. He doesn't hurt the film but he doesn't help either. The late Aaliyah is very good as Akasha--she's sexy, slinky and scary. There's a scene of her eating a still beating human heart that won't leave me. However it's Vincent Perez who steals the movie as Marius (the vampire who \"made\" Lestat). He's obviously enjoying himself and it shows.\n\nSo, it's worth seeing--much better than \"Interview with the Vampire\"."

I was even honored to meet the woman 6 years ago. She is very talented, and Queen of the Damned was by far my favorite of the Chronicles. Now, when the deal to make the movie FINALLY went through, Anne volunteered to write the screenplay... FOR FREE! You'd think any studio would jump at the chance to have the creator of their film subject write the script at no charge. What did these pillars of genius do? They turned her down! THEY TURNED ANNE RICE DOWN! And the film suffered for it.\n\nIn no way is this a Vampire Chronicles movie. In no way is this a good movie. In no way is this even a mediocre movie. The plot was hollow, as where the characters (who in no way resembled those from the books). Townsend is no Lestat. Aaliyah was definitly NOT Akasha. From what I saw, the only ones who liked this movie were those fans of the late singer. People would get up and cheer when she came on the screen. But fans of Anne Rice would groan and complain. That's who this movie should've been made for. Instead it came off as an Aaliyah-vehicle. And not a very good one, at that.\n\nIn my opinion, this film should be destroyed, the DVD never released, and all memory of seeing it wiped from the public's conscience.

It's also nice to see that a black girl was chosen for the role of an Egyptian Queen (No, I'm not predjudice against white people, I am one).

I read the Vampire Lestat about a year ago and loved it and I was fully prepared to watch the movie by finishing Anne Rice's Queen of the Damned the day before I watched it.\n\nI found myself getting more and more furious as the show progressed. None of Anne Rice's characters were recognisable except that maybe they shared the same name. Lestat was obnoxious, cruel and totally unlikable in the movie, which seemed very surprising considering that millions of readers love him in the book. Marius was nothing like the wise, cultured and kind Vampire in the book(he wasn't even the one who made Lestat in the book) The makers of the film had such fun twisting the whole story upside down, I reckon. There are so many things I could say about how the movie does not do the books justice, but I would have to write an essay then. The story of the Legend of the twins was very essential to the story, but they left it out totally which leaves for so many questions.\n\nI read their official website where the producer explains why this was done, that they had no time to fit a lot of what the book is about into the movie, but I just don't buy it, Interview with the Vampire managed to do so, so why couldn't they. They should probably have cut down the long draggy shots in general, or not add additional cheesy scenes that did not exist in the book, THEN they could have got some content in. They just had to turn it into a stupid, cheesy, trashy Vampire flick, sigh. They shouldn't have called it the 'Queen of the Damned' if it wasn't really even safely based on the book, I bet Anne Rice had sleepless nights over this horrible movie.\n\nOkay, let's just put aside the books for a while and try to imagine that this movie wasn't based on one of the greatest Vampire characters and stories of all time.\n\nThe effects were low budget, and the actors in general were bad not to mention the over excited and amateur actors in the backgrounds, obviously goths they pulled off the Melbourne streets. None of the exquisite detailing of Interview with the Vampire. The vampires in general were a scruffy bunch especially the group of Vampires that sucked Akasha dry at the end. And the ending was oh so convenient.\n\nAnd what's with the love story element anyway? I hate this movie and how it has taken away the chance for some other worthier director and production team to do Anne Rice's books justice"

        "review_detailed_main": "When I heard that they were going to do this movie I felt very excited and really looked forward to seeing it. Interview with the vampire was a wonderful movie and I think Tom Cruise did a wonderful performance in that one. Unfortunately when I heard that Aaliyah was cast as Akasha I knew something had gone terribly wrong. First of all Anne Rice should have written the script (like she did for IWTV). The Vampire chronicles are very popular and the film company wouldn't have had any problems getting famous actors in the leading parts. I think Catherine Zeta Jones could have been wonderful as Akasha, Jude Law as Lestat, Lena Olin was great as Maharet and Ralph Fiennes as Marius.\n\nWith a great director this movie could have easily been as great as IWTV but Warner Brothers were so cheap and did not care s### about this movie so they hire this nobody from Australia to direct and cast a couple of Australian actors in supporting parts. Claudia Black was alright as Pandora but the Australian actor who played Armand was totally wrong for the part.\n\nStuart Townsend was a disaster, I don't understand where they found him cause he looked like he was acting in a totally different movie. Aaliyah (God rest her soul) was a beautiful and talented singer but her acting abilities were limited and that is clearly shown in this picture. (Her accent is awful in this movie).\n\nThe screen writers, producers and director is to blame for this mess and that they dedicated this movie to the memory of Aaliyah was a disgrace. She will be remembered for her wonderful music and not for this huge disappointment.\n\nI don't understand why Anne Rice haven't gone out stating how the movie company totally ruined this movie. She was angry that Tom Cruise played Lestat but at least he did a good job in a wonderful movie but this movie should have given her a heart attack cause they haven't been true to her books.\n\nThey only good things about the movie is the Music (Jonathan Davis rules), the Score written by Jonathan and Richard Gibbs and Lena Olin's performance, the rest is crap!!!\n\nStay away from this one!!!!"

But this is the worst movie I have ever seen! Since they were making Queen of the Damned they SHOULD have had Anne Rice do the screen play and not some 2 other dudes. Anne Rice did the screen play for Interview with the Vampire and it was great, even though some parts were changed they wernt drastic changes and it didnt make a difference because the story was still the same as the book. It seems as if they only got a summary of the movie and never actually read the book. They changed WAY TOO MUCH for it to be acceptable. They changed important things, like who made Lestat. They were way too vague of how the Queen was made a vampire and how it all started and why they wanted to kill the Queen. They didnt fully introduce all the characters. Like near the end the have , some might I add, of the vampires that are there when they kill the Queen and they were never introduced of who the heck they were! Seriously, if you wanna KNOW the REAL story of the Queen of the Damned, READ THE BOOK, it is a VERY GOOD BOOK. SO dont waste your money in buying or renting this movie unless you enjoy watching very very bad movies. And even if I never read the book i still wouldnt have liked it, it lacked a plot, unlike the book."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm a purist, it's true, when it comes to book/movie adaptations. In the past, I'd have read a book and then watch a movie, and I'd always be disappointed. I've seen some bad ones(\"Little Women\" the one with Winona Ryder as Jo), and some very good ones(the HP movies, the Firm, IwtV). But this movie definitely falls under the \"bad ones\" category.\n\nJust before this movie came out, I'd made a vow never to support Anne Rice again by buying her books or watching her movies because of the travesties that were \"The Vampire Armand\" and \"Merrick\". So I didn't see until a week or so ago on cable.\n\nFirst, kudos go to Stuart Townsend. I believe that for the most part, he captured Lestat and made him his own. The scene with the two blonds at the beginning was very Lestat-like. He captured his innate curiosity and his arrogance, as well has appreciation of living human beauty. It also helps that his stature and carriage and beauty is appropriate for the role.\n\nThe actor who played David Talbot did well with the lack of character development. He may have been a tad too young, but he played the concerned father-like archivist/researcher true to character.\n\nNow Marius, what a piss-poor job of putting this remarkable and wonderful character on the silver screen. The actor, in spite of this, is very good. I hope to see him in more, and better, things.\n\nAaliyah, may she rest in peace, easily captured her character and portrayed Akasha expertly. Her early death has robbed Hollywood of an actress with potential.\n\nThe lack of the story of the twins and the explanation of the Great Family, one of the main plots in the book, is reprehensible. This part of the book explained Marius' role in the vampire hierarchy, as well as Maharet, Khayman, etc. value to the storyline. It puts Jessie in a frame of reference. Without it, her character has very little importance.\n\nOn the same note, the omission of Mekare is just unfounded. There was no reason whatsoever to cut her out. Especially as she is essential to the end.\n\nThe scenery, costumes, music, and all the behind-the-scenes type stuff was done well. The sound of Lestat's rock group was excellent, very well done for the modernization of it.\n\nI thought that for a stand-alone, it doesn't function as well as IwtV did. Because of all the gaps in the story and lack of character development, I'm glad I've read the book to fill it in.\n\nAll I'm going to say about the end is that it is completely wrong. And while that worked for \"The Firm\", not so well for this one.\n\nIn the words of Capt. Blackadder from \"Blackadder Goes Forth\": \"Well, it started badly, and it, it tailed off a little in the middle, and the less said about the end, the better. But, but, apart from that, excellent.\"\n\nWell, maybe not \"excellent\", but maybe you'll like it anyway. Afterward, read the book. But just a warning, after this book, AR goes absolutely barking, and she loses her focus. But this book is just amazing, one of my favorites. Make up your own mind."

It sort of draws you in, could be said there is some strange magic to it, or at least to the characters in the movie, especially that of Akasha. Aaliyah seems to have really lived into her character, which adds the plus points to the movie. The special effects are also pretty decent. If you're into vampires then you'll love it just for the sake of the \"vampiric\" romance the movie tries to portray."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'll be honest, I do admit to actually watching this film and enjoying it even after reading the books, mainly because I saw the film first and was glad that it didn't spoil the books. It is a big guilty pleasure of mine, but I will grant that now reading most of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles and I also will grant that it about as faithful to them as \"300\" was to history, but once you put the books aside and forget all about them, it's a decent film to say the least.\n\nMany fans have despised this film for butchering the books and some actually enjoy it because it had introduced them to the books in the first place (as it did to me), but personally I think it would have done a good job as a film if it was just in chronological order and faithful to the book. For example, Stuart Townsend has been criticized for is performance as he wasn't playing the character of Lestat from the books. Frankly, I think Townsend could have played a good Lestat if he wanted to, seeing him in other films where he had done a good job, but clearly the writers had different ideas. Needless to say, the film would have been good if it had either a different title and different names or was at least faithful to the book. But apparently, the writers had only looked up a fair few pages of the books and thought that was a good idea.\n\nBut there are some good points to the film: The soundtrack is brilliant, Vincent Perez (Marius) appears to be the only one in character, Lena Olin is wonderful as Maharet (despite her lack of blindness, let alone a twin sister) and although Townsend does not play the twisted and humorous side of Lestat, he does add the seduction, arrogance and edginess that Tom Cruise did not have. After all, it might be hard to take Tom Cruise seriously as a rock star lip- syncing to Korn, though he did do a brilliant job in the original first installment of the chronicles on film.\n\nAnd to my astonishment, I watched the film in French for practice not too long ago and Lestat was a lot more in character when dubbed in French...very strange.\n\nAnyhow, yes, on a whole the film does little to no justice to the books, but it is enjoyable if you're bored and in need of something semi-dark or if you're in need of an introduction to the books to get a taste of what they're like. Although, the books, to me, are almost unfilmable since they are filled with rather heavy metaphysical matters."

        "review_detailed_main": "I`ve never read The Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice but I do vaguely remember seeing INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE , of which QUEEN OF THE DAMNED is a sequel . Lestat is now played by Stuart Townsend instead of Tom Cruise and our vampire anti-hero decides to become a rock star . Doesn`t that premise sound slightly silly ? It does to me and it`s not helped by the way the characters in the story react to the idea that a rising rock star is indeed a vampire . If Marilyn Manson claimed to be a blood sucking vampire would he become an even bigger media sensation ? I don`t think so either . Having said that if Michael Jackson claimed the same thing that would explain a lot , like for example why he looks so pale and avoids sunlight . Oooppps better not go there guys\n\nAs I said I`ve never read Anne Rice so I`ve no idea how it`s been adapted to screen but as you may expect from a tale about a rock star vampire there`s a bit too much MTV imagery involved . Stuart Townsend plays Lestat very well ( Though I doubt if he`d been successful as Aragorn - He`s a bit too young ) with the right amount of sexiness and camp . Unfortunately the rest of the cast are a bit too poe faced to make much of an impression especially former DOCTOR WHO Paul McGann . There`s another problem with the cast and that`s the minor \" British \" characters . As I was watching the movie I couldn`t help noticing that they didn`t have British accents , they had \" Strine \" accents , strine being the variant English accent that Australians speak . It wasn`t until I came to this page to write this review that I discovered that QUEEN OF THE DAMNED is an American /Australian co-production and that most of the minor Brit characters are indeed played by Aussies\n\nAt the end of the day QUEEN OF THE DAMNED may appeal to horror / Lestat fans and MTV addicts but I found it a silly film that takes itself far too seriously at the same time"

        "review_detailed_main": "The soundtrack is blaring with punk rock through the entire movie, during some of its music-free moments there is filler sounds of screaming and thunder that seem to be coming from hell and beyond. What is ultimately the most notable is deciding whether the special effects or the dialogue is cheesier in this B-grade vampire movie. Allegedly based on Anne Rice's The Vampire's Chronicles, the movie certainly raises the question on whether director Michael Rymer has ever read the source material. There is some kind of plot here, but the reckless visual style never is able to distinguish anything of storytelling clarity, especially in the final third of the movie.\n\nStuart Townsend plays the multi-centuries old vampire Lestat (there's a reason why Tom Cruise didn't come back), whom in the present day has become a punk rocker in effort to capture a legion of fans. This movie however is showcasing it as the feature film debut of the 22-year old singer Aaliyah, who died tragically earlier this year. By the way, it's not her feature debut, it's not even her first `starring' role either; Romeo Must Die has those honors. Some of her fans will be disappointed that she doesn't arrive with her first speaking scene until the first hour into the movie.\n\nThere is an adrenaline of excitement when Aaliyah does make her arrival which sends the screen blazing. As the 6,000-year old vampire Akaska, the late singer has an electrifying introduction, but it is too bad however that the movie's thrills are few and far between. Townsend has a few amusing scenes where he invites a couple of groupies into his private sanctuary. The groupies are hot for this punk rocker, but Lestat is hot for their blood which is fortunate because some of the nastiness does generate some chuckles.\n\nBlood is a welcome palette of color in this movie because it is photographed in dreary, dark gray-blue tones. The scenery is often very bland, and so after awhile it becomes easy to welcome bad dialogue in order to spark some kind of amusement. Cheesy sample dialogue: `There's nothing [left] but the cold, dark wasteland of eternity,' Lestat bemuses, bored with his immortality. He thankfully has a publicist and fanfare that will encourage him with compliments like, `You're bold like your music!' A vampire scholar played by Marguerite Moreau (in need of some of Mariah Carey's acting tips) tracks down Lestat in order to learn from him, and then becomes seduced by his black charms. Unsurprisingly, there is little interest between them.\n\nThe real heat in the film exists between Lestat and Akaska, whom together momentarily resuscitate a movie in danger of flat-lining. The scenes between them, especially the ones that involve them drinking from each other's blood, are morbid but teasingly erotic. Also in this movie exists scenes of underground night clubs that patronize the vampire culture, and surprise, they are all into grunge rock. What is worse however is that much of the movie's sensationalistic scenes are filmed and edited like a bad grunge rock music video. Also, once you get past the thin and unrealized potential of the plot, there isn't much left here that will make you give a damn."

Considering the film is only 97 minutes long i'd say they did quite well with the plot but it could have been soooo much better. My main suggestion for improvement is to stick more closely to the books because they are excellent. The description and dialogue in the books is so much more detailed than in the movie. in the movie its cut so much if you haven't read the books you barely know whats happening. in the film the character of Jesse has too big a part and too little a point, she actually has a point in the book. they should have either included more of Lestats history or made 2 separate films, The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned because there is simply too much story to be told in 97 minutes. Lestat should not be made by Marius and the legend of the twins should be included and most importantly Mekare, Maharets twin sister. the demise of Akasha was so much better when Mekare killed her and became the new queen of the damned. the merging of characters in this part was the worst mistake the film makers could make in my opinion. i really hope someone does this again in the near future but hopefully a new one would be more accurate. on a positive note Aaliyahs portrayal of Akasha was great because of her i don't care what you want approach to the other vampires. overall good viewing but don't take it too seriously or you will just get confused."

Of course I was disappointed because the role of Aaliyah, Akasha did not seem to make much sense to me. She only appeared in the last part of the movie and did some flashy stuff there was no depth in the story. The movie seemed rushed. I guess this is because it was two books in one. Which I thought was a real pity. I have seen \"Interview with a vampire\" and I liked it because the movie seemed to have many complete stories in one. Also it worked my emotions. I especially can remember how angry i was at a certain point of that movie. This movie on the other hand seemed to lack any kind of storyline at all. There was no suspense in the movie. If the last scene had played directly after the first scene it would not have made any difference. Because for me the movie left so many questions unanswered."

Queen of the Damned is my least favorite of them all, however it is still a very good book, though slow in a few sections in my opinion, and that Queen is damned better than this damn Queen.\n\nOthers have explained how this movie doesn't bother to follow the books so I won't dwell on that, but I wholeheartedly agree. What the hell were they smoking when they wrote the script to this? Or perhaps, since some drugs do make people more creative, (throw your music collection away if you don't think so) what WEREN'T they smoking?\n\nThe only storyline gripe I'll go over here is all the vampires fighting Akasha at the end of the movie. Those other vampires are MAJOR characters in the book. They're given a glimpse of screen time in the movie.. all of a sudden the vampire posse you've seen 3 frames of previously shows up and wipes out the main villain who wasn't even in the movie much. (yes, I know she died, doesn't make the movie any better) They really needed to at least introduce some of the other vampires before they came in to play the hero role.\n\nMy biggest gripe with this movie is the soundtrack, and more specifically the garbage Lestat sings. Why does Lestat suddenly turn into the guy from Korn when he sings? Does that make ANY sense?? ANY?!?! Besides, Korn is awful, and regardless of their talent, I don't exactly think of that when I think of something a vampire would sing. I think maybe something similar to Type O Negative music, with NEW vocals, not just an existing band's song, may have fit a little better without sounding like glam rock, which is kind of what the book makes it sound like, and I think even that would work beautifully in comparison with the crap that comes out of Lestat's throat... oh sorry, I mean out of nowhere since it doesn't sound like Lestat or even close to it.\n\nThis is pure tripe that was thrown together to take advantage of Vampire Chronicles movie rights, was made for a quick buck. As a fan of the books I was insulted by the plot, and I don't think there would even be enough there for this thing to even make sense to people that haven't read the books.\n\nAvoid it. Interview With the Vampire didn't follow the book 100% either, but it was beautifully filmed and retained the feel of the book. This is crap. Read the books The Vampire Lestat, and Queen of the Damned and you'll understand why, and you'll likely get a lot of enjoyment out of them in the process."

They changed so much it's SCARY So much was changed they should have just renamed all the main characters. Its a lame Teen Flick. If you like cheesy B-Movies, this is probably your thing. Because the whole thing is a train wreck IMHO.\n\nOne of the Worst book to film translations I have ever seen. Lestat in Love with Jessie, she is in the book for maybe 2 chapters, and the Twins are nowhere to be found are the center of the story. (Only Maharet is there...) Marius as Lestat's creator?!?!? A women with a violin?!?! what?!?! Leaving out Louis, Lestat's Mother, and Daniel, and Lestat having Brown Hair is a crime. Lestat's diary?!? LOL! Lestat would never keep diary, that was Claudia's diary in the book. AWFUL! I could list changes forever.\n\nStewart is passive, forgettable and corny as Lestat (what is with the Dracula-ish accent!?!?!). And poor Aaliyah is completely sub-par to completely horrible to cheesy. The two main stars are below average. And the rest of the casting has got be some of the worst casting I have seen this year. I HATED Jessie, they turned her into a stupid teenager! Completely hated her character. She was a minor character in the book anyway (and not to mention she was 35 years old in the book).\n\nVampire fans who have not read the books, might be kinda entertained. But even they might be bored or confused.\n\nIf you really must see it, wait for rental or even HBO. Not worth a $10 ticket price at all.\n\nFANS OF THE BOOKS AVOID AT ALL COSTS!\n\n2/10"

I felt so confused after seeing Qotd. And even more after have read Anne Rices books. The story in Qotd doesn't seem to have anything incommon with the real story, that's very disturbing. Interview with the vampire held itself within the frames of the storyline of the book it was based on. Like Qotd mixes two books in the chronicle series, skipped parts for example who made Lestat a vampire etc. I looked trough some comments before writing my own. I can't believe why people have to defend Aliyas (spelling?) performance. OK she is dead, but hell!! Does her life's work become a splendid masterpiece because of that? Her acting in the movie sucks. So does everything else in the movie. Not even descent effects. Like the scene were she walks out of the burning nightclub. Damn good job, NOT!!\n\nI could go on about how awful movie this is. It should not have seen the day of light (haha)."

This is only undermined by Lestat falling in love with a human girl called Jesse, who wants to be a vampire herself. Her curiosity leads her to have several meetings with the elusive vampire Lestat.

He may not have the blond hair and blue eyes that are so vividly described in the book, but to be fair, he would not look good with blond hair, and Lestat is most definitely about looking good. He moves like the predator I always imagined Lestat would have.\n\nThe visual effects are pretty good, and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing. It's not Interview with the Vampire, so don't try to compare the two. Interview is Louis' story. This is a cut and paste version of Lestat's. In any case, I highly recommend."

Thus, the film shows his birth to the world of vampires and his connection with the vampire queen Akasha, who awakens from a secular sleep.\n\nIt is, in theory, the continuation of the movie \"Interview with the Vampire\", although there is no connection between these two productions (remember that Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt starred in these film, which was a huge success). So, who expects \"Queen of the Damned\" will also be great is going to have a big disappointment. In fact, it's the worst vampire movies I've ever seen, sacrificing the dramatic and psychological depth of the characters in favor of a pop-rock approach of the vampire world, which seems to have been thought to sell the film to the teen audiences and not to make it better.\n\nDirected by Michael Rymer, this film has an unfortunate and shameful script by Scott Abbott and stars the singer Aaliyah (deceased shortly after the shootings) and Stuart Townsend in the lead roles. Despite this stars, the film goes from the grotesque to the comic, depicting the teenagers like a bunch of mentally retarded with serious identity affirmation problems. Ah, of course: if you read Rice's books, forget them. This movie failed to portray the books or his essence. Basically, it's a different story whit characters with the same names of the Rice's books. A shame, a tragedy: the great victim of this film's vampires was Anne Rice's stories."

The performance lacked the sense of unique angry insanity brought to it by Tom Cruise in Neil Jordan's 'Interview with the Vampire' now ordinarily i wouldn't dream of saying such a thing about Tom Cruise but we all have to make exceptions and he played Lestat to perfection.\n\nThe ending was Hollywood not Anne Rice, it all seemed it end rather suddenly in a dark Indiana Jones sort of way. In a dramatic final scene with serious over-kill as far as visual effects are concerned Lestat saves the day.\n\nI swear Lestat has had a personality change! In 'Interview-' he was so... flawed with no care for human life and yet here he practically becomes Louis and it doesn't suit him.\n\nThat character: Jesse, she annoyed me and i don't know why she just did.\n\nOverall: It's worth watching but nothing about it exceeds Interview with the Vampire so don't expect anything nearly as good."

In no way was the film as powerful or emotional compared to the last film (Interview with The Vampire). I had expected more from it by seeing the trailer. The acting was okay, but the last film had some of the best and most well-known actors so once again if I compare it, it would not be as good. The ending was quite predictable. It seemed to me it was one of those movies you watch just to be entertained and not to make you think what so ever really.

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie focuses on Lestat (Stuart Townsend) a vampire lured into the whole new rock scene. So tired of hiding underneath the shadows, he was quickly engulfed with his new discovery he joins the goth band Satan's Night Out and before we know it in a flash--- he has the music industry and legions of fans attention. Part of his mystery is he kept people guessing if he was a \"real vampire\" about to \"catch his breakfast\". Enter Jesse(Marguerite Moreau ) a Talamasca member, her job is to research on all things out of ordinary, you guessed it right she gets to know about vampires! She stumbles across Lestat's old journal which gave us a background about his 'life' or whatever you want to call an undead's life. Instantly Jesse has this little school girl obsession towards him. They meet, have a connection.\n\nMeanwhile,we come to learn about Lestat's fascination of the \"Those Who Must be Kept\" the very first vampires and that is Akasha(Aaliyah) and Enkil who are hidden in Marius'(Vincet Perez)chamber as statues sleeping. We later learn Lestat drank from the Queen the night he played his violin for her. Marius his teacher and maker warns him about the danger of the Queen. Back to modern day,Lestat has a Death Valley Concert and Oh no! Akasha has awakened! Lestat joins her and gets to do the \"vampire nasty\". Now this beautiful evil lures Lestat to become her lover and partner in her wrath to destroy. Will Lestat turn his back on her now?\n\nThe film is not something to be taken seriously, I don't think that was the intention. It's a fun vampire rock movie, no more,no less. It's flashy, fast paced,funny,vibrant and violent, at times scary. It completely butchered the book. First of all,Queen Of The Damned and Vampire Lestat combination already sounded awry, it's completely hard to adapt that part of the chronicles. The vampire history was completely scrapped in the movie, which disappointed me. I do see why though, it will turn out to be so long-winded and that's like a whole movie by itself. Lestat is basically the focal point here and the filmmakers basically had a new spin on his story. I believe if they did take themselves seriously as a page by page adaptation for a film, I don't think it might work quite as well.\n\nThe acting was decent, my favorite would be Vincent Perez's Marius though odd looking as a short haired, pale and thin lips, he surprisingly caught the essence of the character. Lena Olin was a great Maharet what the hell she's great in everything. Stuart Townsend though he got the evil, mischievous, sexy and androgynous side of Lestat, he's no Tom Cruise. I literally squirm at the sound of his horrible accent, he would've been good but that accent really irks me. He should've been mute all through out,aaah! The nightmares I will have. Marguerite Moreau (Jesse) suffers with such a boring and lousy chracter with hardly any depth, at times how I wanted Akasha to drink her all up or do that heart stunt to her. Poor girl, she did what she could do, I can't blame her she can only do so much to a bland character. I must disagree though about the comment given about Aaliyah's acting, coming from someone who was never a fan and am never familiar with her work both as a singer and an actress, I thought she played Akasha very well indeed. Sensual,arrogant and totally intimidating and screwed up as hell. Sure, she's a mediocre villain but that bar scene made me want to clap as she walks over the fires with this serpentine movements,so alluring. As a sophomore film effort, she was great.\n\nAbout the soundtrack Jon Davis and Richard Gibbs did an amazing job integating the nu-metal influence in this vampire flick, although I thought it was a bit overdone, I would have wanted more of the violin score from time to time. Maybe because I'm not a big fan of hardcore metal/rap music anyway.\n\nOverall, take a bite it's an entertaining ride. You're right this is no 'Interview'...I don't think it wants to be."

If we make a difference game between the two movies, QOTD end with a lost.\n\nThe actors: Tom Cruise will always be the perfect visualisation of Lestat, he had a good comprehension of the evil inside Lestat. Stuart Towsend, even if he has the intelligence to not act as a 'Tom Cruise clone', is fader and he doesn't seem to be an old vicious and experienced vampire.\n\nThe directors: Neil Jordan has made a romantic story (in the litterature sense of the word), due to his intense collaboration with Ann Rice. Michael Rymer has made a good video clip for \"Lestat Rock Band\", it's the MTV style, certainly a consequence of the absence of Ann Rice for the supervision of the script.\n\nThe Music: Elliot Goldenthal has made a partition that brought the visual style of the movie to another level. Just listening the music makes you feel the vampiric emotions. In QOTD, close tour eyes and you feel nothing exept that you want to break something.\n\nThe visual effects: They seems to be better in QOTD but, if you look at the first movie, you'll notice that they're just visual effects, not supernatural effects. They try to representent supernatural, but they are just fake ones.\n\nBUT, even if QOTD seems to be a less better movie than his predecessor, I think it isn't right to say it's a bad movie. Making an adaptation is making choices, and QOTD is an harder book to adapt that the rest of the Vampire Chronicles, because it's story is more complicated. The principal argument of Interview with the Vampire was that the vampire has to live with the current time, not with past. The adaptation choice results from that: Lestat is no longer a romantic character, he now live in another time, where all is fake and superficial. That's the essence of QOTD, and it's not as stupid as it seems. SEE IT, it's no waste of time, if you like gothic atmosphere..."

If you've read the books.. prepare to be sorely disappointed. Lazy writing, basic cable grade special effects, and lackluster acting made this painful to revisit. Even more so when you realize this was Aaliyah's final performance.. and although hers is one of the better performances, it's not enough to make this watchable. Even Twilight managed to feign a plot... it's a shame that the superior book ended up being an inferior film to that rotting pile of ridiculousness."

        "review_detailed_main": "In the second book and onward, Lestat restricted himself to killing murderers. He developed a sense of ethics about how to sustain his existence. So I was astonished when his manager brought in 2 girls who Lestat killed. There was no sign of them being the kind of evil-doers who the books' Lestat would have killed. So that was the sign for me that the movie was going to move far away from the books. One of the attractions of Lestat, after Interview, was that he endeavored to be more ethical. But the scene with the girls seemed like the movie was sexualizing the murder of innocents. I stopped watching it. Although Anne Rice's vampire novels went too far into supernatural territory for my tastes, I still feel that her portrayal of an ethical vampire was more interesting. I read that the director believed that concepts of good and evil would not fit in the vampire story. But I think that it makes for a more compelling story to have vampires able and willing to consider ethics in how they survive. Plus I think that some behaviors, such as those of this movie's Lestat, should not be portrayed as somehow OK."

To associate it in any way with the prior Chronicles film is ridiculous as it is ridiculously inconsistent with that movie, let alone the book. The bare few ideas taken from Rice's genius in \"The Vampire Chronicles\" were butchered and ridiculed.\n\nIt is an absolute insult to Anne Rice fans everywhere and such a pathetic excuse for a legacy in being Aaliyah's last film. Truly, it's an insult to Aaliyah fans as well.\n\nPossibly the only compliment can be paid to the sound effects as well as some of the graphics.

        "review_detailed_main": "With Queen of the Damned, as with many adaptations and sequels, there is the question of whether it should be judged on its own merits or relative to the original. As this movie is an adaptation and a sequel, this applies double. The answer I suppose, depends on how familiar you are with the original works.\n\nThis project showed problems from the beginning. Though it was a sequel to a critical and financial success , the budget was 30% lower and Anne Rice, who adapted her own novel the first time around, was denied the chance to do so again.\n\nIn fact, forget what I said about this being a sequel. None of the cast and crew from Interview with the Vampire return, the events of the previous movie are never mentioned, the style is quite different and only one character returns in any identifiable way. What you're left with is two movies with a vampire named Lestat who seems to be full of himself. If it weren't for the novels and Anne Rice's credit, people would probably regard this as a coincidence.\n\nQueen of the Damned inadvisably combines Anne Rice's novels Queen of the Damned and The Vampire Lestat into a single feature. Fans of the books will be upset by the nearly eliminated back-story and the numerous changes, many of them significant and without apparent reason. People who aren't familiar with the books will probably be a little more receptive, but even on its own merits, the movie isn't very good.\n\nIts main problem is that the script is full of ideas that aren't developed very well. We're left with characters that are doing things, but why and why we should care are barely touched upon because the sections explaining that were removed or altered. For instance, the ancients, who played a major part in the book, are in the movie, but we aren't told why they're here or who they are. They're just some vampires who show up for some reason.\n\nA slightly more serious problem is we aren't given any characters to like or identify with. Unlike the book, the vampire characters kill indiscriminately, making them come across as much more villainous. Jesse, the only major mortal character comes across as dumb. If we don't like anyone or understand what's going on, how are we supposed to care how it all turns out?\n\nThe acting is serviceable, but not great. Vincent Perez is quite good as Marius, and Aaliyah has a strong screen presence, but her dubbed dialogue doesn't really work. Everyone else is one notch above bad. Accents are a particularly notable problem. Lead Stuart Townsend's attempt at a French accent is unfortunately one of the worst.\n\nThe special effects are a mixed bag. The vampire deaths are very impressive, but the speed and flying effects are laughable. The sad part is that the DVD shows a documentary about the special effects and several of the other ideas they considered for this effect looked much better.\n\nThe only real saving grace of the movie is the soundtrack. Richard Gibbs and Jonathan Davis collaborated on an excellent score and also several original songs Lestat's band performs. While I know a few people disagree with me, I feel these are very fitting . It's perfectly believable these songs could become hits and they seem just like what Lestat would come up with.\n\nI'm giving this movie a 3/10. The music and a few good effects and production design decisions are all that keep it from being a one. It isn't campy enough to be fun, isn't scary at all, so doesn't work as horror and has no apparent point or themes so it doesn't make for good drama either. Recommended for the morbidly curious only. Watch at your own risk."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm usually not inclined to write reviews about films I don't think deserve a mention. But, in the quest to grow as a writer and film critic, I feel it is important to express my thoughts when I DON'T like a film. \"Queen of the Damned\" is one of those films.\n\nAnne Rice's popular horror stories of Lestat, a bisexual Vampire, first took to the screen in 1994 in the successful \"An Interview With A Vampire\". Starring two of Hollywood's biggest heavyweights in Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, the film's stylish aesthetic and gothic mise en scene captured the audience. While it may have been a case of style way over substance, there was something about it that worked, despite its chessiness (I have never been that enamoured with the Vampire genre in general).\n\nSince that time Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise have gone on to much bigger things. It's likely both would have roared with laughter when asked to appear in a sequel. They would have been laughing even harder when they saw the final outcome. \"Queen of the Damned\" typifies the type of cr*p Hollywood is content to put out at a low cost with the hope of earning a quick buck thanks to an average soundtrack and big marketing campaign aimed at 13 to 17 year olds.\n\nNeedless to say this film is terrible from the start. Lestat, now played by Brit Stuart Townsend of \"Shooting Fish\" fame, awakens from his dark grave to the sound of... you guessed it, Nu-Metal. He freaks out some confused punkish musicians and joins their band, under the proviso that he only appear at night, what with the sun burning his skin and all during the day...\n\nJesse (Marguerite Moreau), a student studying the paranormal (Vampire Studies 101 perhaps?), tries to find out if Lestat really is who he says he is. Along the way she falls for him (something to do with her odd past), but has a little competition in Queen Akasha (Aaliyah), a Vampire demon queen who is returning from the underworld to acquire Lestat as her chosen King.\n\nThe film is shamefully self-indulgant, yet its campy tone leaves some room for its depreciating humour. Anybody who sees this film for anything but a good laugh needs to see more films in general! Watching Townsend is enjoyable. He knows the role is utterly over the top and does his best to walk the tightrope between utter hamming and serious acting. The late Aaliyah is, unfortunately, terrible in the title role. She has minimal screentime, and what she does have she does not use to the fullest. The poor makeup and special effects do not help; at times she sounds like she's talking through a voicebox.\n\nIt is rumoured that this film was heading straight to video until Aaliyah's untimely death last year. With the possibility for people to see her final film, Warner Bros put this out to a general release. Otherwise this would have been one of those movies you see on the shelf at video shops but avoid because you can tell it is going to be simply terrible.\n\nNo doubt films like this will continue to be made. Look at the spate of teen rom-com rip offs around or the spoofing of that genre itself with films like \"Not Another Teen Movie\". If there is a market to exploit Hollywood will do so.\n\nThe biggest issue I have with this film is not the film itself. Hollywood is about making money, so if there is a market for this film then they will pursue it. That's business. But what concerns me the most is that people will actively go out to the cinema and pay money to watch it! I guess that's the biggest argument in the world of cinema: is film art first and entertainment second, or is it the other way around? The only people who can decide that is the audience. If you like and are intrigued by good films, stay clear of this turkey."

        "review_detailed_main": "I hesitated for YEARS to watch this movie, because Interview with the Vampire is one of my absolute favorite movies and based on the summary (\"Lestat becomes a rock star and awakens an ancient vampire queen\") it sounded awful, like some cringey fanfiction written by a 14-year-old on Wattpad. Nevertheless I finally decided to give it a chance, and... well it was exactly that.\n\nTo get some of the positives out of the way first, there are a lot of very gorgeous aesthetics, some great outfits, and plenty of good music. But that's where the good things end. I can imagine young teens loving this just for the aesthetic feast that it is, but the characters and plot and dialogue are all just painful.\n\nIt's hard not to compare this to Interview, and it certainly pained me to see Lestat as an entirely different character. Trying to think of this movie as its own thing helps it somewhat, but it by no means saves it. Plenty of very cringeworthy dialogue, so bad in fact that I almost turned the movie off very early on. The overall plot feels very \"hey kids what if we made Lestat a cool rocker dude with leather pants and an open shirt, the kids like that stuff, right?\" in the worst possible way.\n\nTo my understanding this is two books smashed into one movie, and it REALLY shows. The plot feels extremely rushed to the point where it almost doesn't make sense, and plenty of characters are included with practically no backstory or even context. Who are these people and why should I care? Definitely one of those situations where a movie cannot possibly flesh things out enough in its limited runtime so everything feels rushed and unexplained and hardly makes sense to anyone who hasn't read the book(s).\n\nIt really hurts to see that there IS potential here. This could have been a good movie. Not faithful to the books perhaps, but it could have been a good movie. Disconnect it from Interview to avoid comparisons (as well as inconsistencies in timelines and lore), make the dialogue less cringey, maybe remove some characters and minor plot points that there isn't enough time to explain. A musician vampire - who is not Lestat - could work under different circumstances, and a queen of the vampires could also work. Just done differently.\n\nI will simply pretend that this does not exist as related to Interview, just as I pretend season 4 of Sherlock doesn't exist."

Compared to \"Memnoch the Devil\" it was Shakespeare...how the heck did they turn it into crap? They upped the vomit inducing cheese for starters. The introduction between Lestat and the band was, well, I really don't know how else to put it but \"disgustingly fantastical\" is the only thing I can think of.\n\nWait...there is a better way to review this.\n\nI'm an audiophile among my many material fetishes. Audiophile, bibliophile, cinephile. As such I can be comfortable and enjoy metal as much as I can punk, rock, jazz, whatever.\n\nAnd I know more than a few PhD.'s that head bang along to System of a Down.\n\nThis movie is NOT made for them.\n\nInstead it's the wet dream made for the people who listen to metal, think they are the toughest kung-fu ninjas on the planet, and breath through their mouths.\n\nYou know the type, the people that think Metallica wrote \"Turn the Page.\" This movie is made for them.\n\nFor everyone else it's just a painful thing to watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't know why people assume that just because a movie is based on a book it has to have the same storyline. And it happens very often actually when someone makes a book adaptation we expect to see the characters as we imagined them and the background about them as well. But what we need to understand is that when someone bases the movie on a book, it only mean that they are going to use their names maybe some major storyline, they might even only use names and the fact that they are vampires. It doesn't necessarily mean that it have to be all the same as the book.\n\nThat being said I have to say that as for the movie, it is not a masterpiece, but it did become a cult. Probably, it wasn't because of the script, but that doesn't change the fact that at least every goth or vampire loving person knows the movie and it is highly possible that he/her saw the movie. For me it was actually a nice easy going movie. I can watch any time. O actually saw the movie more than I can count. And to be honest I don't know why it has such a bad reviews all the time. I mean for Stuart Townsed was genius as vampire. And Jessee was great and Marius and the girl with violin. If you really think about it, it is very sentimental, romantic and about someone who is lost for so long and found by love at the end. It is so clich\u00e9 and so predictable, but also it is very controversial, because of the music that is provided.\n\nI think you will all agree that QoTDhas one of the best soundtracks ever. For me personally it was a start of being addicted to that kind of music. It is shame that didn't find an actor who could actually sing, I believed Stuart when he was singing. I can't imagine for example Jonathan Davis to be Lestat even though he sings his songs. Also we had Chester from LP, Deftones or Marilyn Manson. It was really incredible. Or the violin parts, it has kind of ethereal feel to it. I think about the movie more as musical than a serious piece about vampires. At least they didn't sparkle and had fangs."

Sure she's the movie's title character, but I really think they used all the footage they had of her in the movie to make the preview. Stuart Townsend successfully portrays the vampire Lestat with his brooding tendencies and pale skin. And yes, there are actually humans in this movie! Unseen in the previews is the character Jesse Reeves, who has a major role and gets my vote for the person whose identity I would want to replace had the movie been real life.\n\nMaybe I'm just a shmuck for vampires, or just movies in general, but I found it to be a moving thriller with a few unexpected, yet appreciated, twists."

The supporting cast was great: Aliyah was effective as the Queen of the Vampires; Vincent Perez was great as Marius.\n\nMaybe it is just me; I loved the whole dark, almost Goth theme to the movie, along with a Lestat who is tired of living through eternity alone. I think the movie was wonderful and much better than Interview with the Vampire (although I like that movie too and I missed Louis in this movie)\n\nPlus the soundtrack is great!!!\n\n9.5/10 (I must admit that Lestat's accent was a little annoying at times)"

The storyline of the movie was completely skewered from the novel, and failed to adequately touch up on the book's main themes. The acting wasn't the worst, as there were some good performances out there, particularly those by the actors portraying Marius and Lestat. However the failures of the film were the lack of character development and skimming of important details of the book which translated into a jumbled mess. For example there was no mention of the Legend of the Red Headed twins and no insight into the history of the Queen Akasha. If you are going to make a movie of the Queen of the Damned, then you better put her on the screen more and develop her history or her motives. While interweaving a whole novel's content into a 90 minute film is challenging, it's like the producers/directors didn't read the book but settled for the Cliff Notes version. In the end, the film is merely entertainment for those who have NOT read the book and pure folly for those who are avid readers of the Vampire Chronicles. I will see this movie only once but will read the book many, many times."

The setting is Gothic and it has all the trappings of Gothic setting with gray stone walls and stone gargoyles and Egyptian dresses etc. You can compare it to movies like 'UnderWorld', though the stories of both the movies are totally different from each other. But the idea that the world is shared by both mortals and immortals and the way they roam about freely amongst us is very similar.\n\nStuart Townsend, after the initial shock of seeing him milky white with dark circles around his eyes dressed in weird clothes, grows on you. He acts well as a dark brooding lonely figure with macabre sense of humor. Aaliya as queen Akasha looks very pretty, but was really too young to play a powerful negative character. Besides she looks too young to be the mother of all vampires. The actress who played Jesse looks older than Townsend, but she seems to act well. Vincent as Marius is very good."

It seems as if it were written by a real live human writer, a person; perhaps not the world's most talented person, but a person nonetheless. This has to count in its favour when you compare it to other recent robotic exercises in camp such as the horrid 'Tomb Raider.'\n\nThe other good thing about 'Queen' is the casting. Stuart Townsend makes a far better Lestat than Cruise did. Unlike Cruise, he has a certain malevolent effeminacy that is appropriate to the character. Also, he's tall.\n\nAaliyah demonstrates a truly commanding presence as Akasha. At times, she almost makes you want to laugh; she's so over the top. But at the same time, you really can't take your eyes off her. She's so beautiful, so confident -- she really does manage to pull off this quite ridiculous character. Kudos.\n\nIn spite of the low ratings the film seems to be getting, here's hoping it goes on to find a loyal cult audience."

I give it a 2 out of ten only out of pity: I wish the series did not die when Tom Cruise refused his role as Lestat. This is a movie to watch at your own peril. It combines too many of her books in the same, short, skinny movie. It is tragic, however, that the main character, a beautiful and talented woman, died in the making. I think that this only compounds the issue. If you've ever read any of Anne Rices' Vampire novels, or any of her work for that matter, you know that this oversimplifies her created world. If you've got a movie that explores only one book of an author, The Interview with a Vampire, and it lasts just a bit over 2 hours, how can you justify a movie that summarizes 4 books in a little over 1 hour?"

The acting wasnt very convincing either, the best actor was the guy who played 'Lestat' although I didnt think he would be a cool vampire. Aaliyah's first appearance was quite stunning but after that she didnt add anything exciting to the movie. A vampire who reveals his past and comes back after a long time, sounds a good idea indeed but it got me so sleepy, so lil action sigh. And the end was pretty pathetic too. I wonder why Lestat and Jessie get together in the end cos they dont care for each other, my opinion is Jessie just wanted to be a vampire herself. But if thats wrong dont blame me cos I dont know what this movie should have learned us."

Pale skinned, dark haired and red lipped, he does mysterious, intriguing, irresistible and evil all rolled into one. Aaliyah is not quite as wonderful. Although she wasn't bad, her acting was slightly wooden or way over the top and she should have stuck to the day job. (No offence.) This is an incredible movie with a great plot and generally stunning actors. The sets and costumes are just SO Gothic (obviously) and some of the scenes are breathtaking. It's one of those rare occasions where the sequel is actually better than the previous (Interview with the Vampire). A brutal tale with a happy ending. A perfect movie."

I've never really listened to her music but I'm guessing she stretched herself too thin, artistically.\n\nThis movie was gawdawful; the fault largely resting with the paper-thin acting talents of the title character.

After Interview with the Vampire (great except Antonio playing Armand), I had expected The Queen of the Damned to be amazing. Tom Cruise did a fantastic job of being Lestat, so much so that many of us could not imagine any other face on Lestat. Tom Cruise has that fun, smiling devilish presence, which like the character would appeal to everyone and make everyone forgive him. Brad Pitt was the perfect Louis and the Claudia actress did the best job of all. Just too bad about Antonio with his 35+ yr old face trying to play a 16 yr old. Someone like Antonio Sabato Jr would have made a perfect Armand.\n\nThe actor who played Lestat, Stuart Townsend, did not do Lestat any justice at all. Lestat is a golden haired, sexy, laughing and smiling monster, not a brooding, dark and sombre person. Magnus made Lestat not Marius. Marius has long white blond hair, with a large friendly face, not short dark hair a thin mean face.\n\nWhere was Gabrielle, Mekare, Khayman, Eric...????? Maharet was just as powerful as Akasha! Same as Khayman and Mekare. The dramatic ending was horrible and not realistic at all. After looking forward to the movie, I was extremely disappointed as were many Vamp. Chronicle fans.\n\nI hope someone remakes the VAMPIRE LESTAT and QUEEN OF THE DAMNED as 2 separate movies that are more related to the book."

Especially when compared to Interview With The Vampire. The first movie had a complicated story with three dimensional, complex characters. This one didn't.\n\nIn the commentary, the director mentioned and explained all the various changes he made between the book and the movie. But it seemed like almost every single change he made would've made the movie better.\n\nExample; in the movie, LeStat has short brown hair, which is both inaccurate to the book and contradicts the first movie. Especially since vampires can't cut their hair: this was not only established in the last movie but was actually a plot point during Kirsten Dunst's tantrum.\n\nThere was another vampire who sired LeStat but he has REALLY short hair, again, vampires can't cut their hair. And in the book, apparently, he had LONG GREY hair.\n\nThe Queen of the Damned herself had been petrified, and is first seen as a statue, but was reanimated by blood. In the book, her clothes, jewelery and hair were still real. This would've made allot more sense. In the movie whatever petrified her turned her gold jewelery and her cloth garments to stone, too, and these things are also turned back into gold and cloth by blood.\n\nThe only change I'm not complaining about is her skin. The Queen of the Damned, like Cleopatra, was not actually of Ejyptian blood, but was white. She looks fine as she is."

Stuart Townsand was all right as Lestat and if Interview With a Vampire had not been made this film might have been acceptable. But the departures from the second and third books, the resulting mixture of what was left left the fans of Ann Rice's stories feeling cheated. If you have never read the books you will probably enjoy this one. I have it in my library but am forced to ask myself why?"

The Sunday after its release, I called a few of my friends and we went out. I sat in awe as I watched the movie. The acting was brilliant. Stuart Townsend captured Lestat in ways Tom Cruise never could. And Aaliyah- There is no other person that I thought could tackle the role of Akasha as well as she did. And THE MUSIC! Even if you hated the movie, you could not have hated the soundtrack. Jonathan Davis of KoRn had the perfect vocals for the rock star vampire. It was slightly upsetting that Davis' voice could not be heard on the CD, but the artists who were chosen in his place were equally as excellent. It is certainly as must have album. The film was incredible in my opinion."

And still I pushed aside my doubts, reminded myself that \"Interview with the Vampire\" hadn't been too bad, and forked over the five dollars for a ticket to \"Queen of the Damned.\"\n\nI was surprised not to be surprised.\n\n\"Queen of the Damned\" is exactly what it sounds like--a group of pretty actors and actresses (and singers) vying for the position of most ridiculous role. Whether it's Stuart Townsend's laughable portrayal of the dangerous Lestat (who, I had thought, was supposed to be French--I suppose one must disregard Townsend's lisping, almost Germanic attempt at an accent) or Marguerite Moreau's bland performance as the enigmatic Jesse, watching this movie was rather like watching a train crash. It's violent and painful, but you just can't look away.\n\nThe hardest part about writing this review is looking at the ratings, and finding that the lowest one possible is a \"1.\""

On a side note i would like to ask who and why would anybody ever think that chest plate thing would look good on Aaliyah? Rather than being seductive and beautiful like the character was supposed to be akasha (Aaliyah) looked kind of odd and retarded. Not qualities one would usually associate with the supposed vampire queen. The special effects were both bad and good depending on the scene. Most any use of vampiric power looked more cheesy than supernatural. The one saving grace of the movie effects wise was the really well done CG of Akasha turning into ash and slowly blowing away. I wont even mention how horrible the movie is after you read the books. If the characters did not share names you would never think it was the same story or characters."

They capture much of what we have all read about (the blood-swoon drunkedness, the marble-like appearance of Enkil and Akasha, the speed at which the vampires move, etc.) with technical achievement - but David Talbot seems to have already lived through \"Body Thief\" - it's story items like this that make it difficult to figure out how they will deal with any of the other novels, and further confuse those who haven't read Ms. Rice's work.

Who knew after rising from a hundred year rest in a cascate, you could instantly become a rockstar? If I was a vampire I would have a very dry throat and couldn't even talk. DAMNED is just another excuse for seeing people get their necks bitten, their blood sucked, and then turned into vampires--and its all too boring. Don't waste your money. My Take: 4/10 My MPAA rating: PG-13 for some vampire violence and brief sexuality."

Great vampire movie."

Director Michael Rymer brought us such other flops as Perfume (2001) and In Too Deep (1999). Aaliyah's last screen appearance is wasted in what amounts to little more than a few words in 10 minutes screen time. The only scary thing about this film is how it managed to be made."

So, what on earth possessed Warner Brothers to just skip the second and most interesting part? That is just one of many things that is wrong with this movie. Whereas the big screen adaptation of Interview with the Vampire stayed true to the original written work, the Queen of the Damned does nothing of the sort: the story is completely wrong and the vampires are nothing like the ones portrayed in the books. In fact, the only good thing about this film is its soundtrack. If you liked the books, please don't watch this film and just stick to its predecessor. It's not even worth getting worked up over."

        "review_detailed_main": "It says on the front cover of the DVD of 'Queen of the Damned' that it is the sequel to 'Interview With a Vampire' \u2013 you remember that \u2013 the smash hit movie, starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. Everyone loved that. It was a hit! Unfortunately, 'Queen of the Damned' is only a sequel as it's using some of the same characters (characters, not actors \u2013 there's a difference) and set in the same universe, so to speak. Basically, it's not really a sequel. It's another vampire story written by Anne Rice following some of the characters who you might have seen before. Don't expect to see Tom or Brad in this one.\n\nHowever, just because it doesn't really follow on, doesn't make it a bad thing \u2013 a disjointed thing, but not a bad thing. But, in some ways, it's not really the film's fault. It's about a vampire who has got disillusioned with drinking people's blood over the centuries and has gone to sleep for hundreds of years. Now he's woken in the modern age and decided to 'out' all the other vampires and their blood-sucking ways. It goes without saying that the rest of the vamps don't take kindly to his outspoken ways and decide to take him out. So where does the Queen come into it? She doesn't. That much. Unfortunately she's only in it for two scenes because the young actress playing her tragically died while the film was being made, leaving the story lacking what should have been a big part of its central element.\n\nPlus it doesn't really do the book justice. I haven't read the book. I'm one of the many who just watches the film, but I've generally browsed through enough internet message boards to realise that a lot of die-hard fans of the source material didn't appreciate the transition to film.\n\nSo, it's got its fair amount of negative points. And yet it's actually quite good. Not great, but somehow highly watchable (if you're into vampires in general). It should all be quite campy and yet Stuart Townsend plays the lead vamp pretty well and is actually fun to watch. Aaliyah, for the few scenes she's in, sizzles as the Queen of the undead. It would have been pretty good if she'd have been able to show what she can do all the way through the film.\n\nIt's probably not a film you're going to want to see again and again, but if you're not totally bored with vampires after binge-watching box sets of 'True Blood' then take a look at vampires rocking out on stage and fighting each other in the chorus."

Also, even if I wasn't a huge fan of Anne Rice and didn't read any of her books, I still wouldn't have liked it. It lacked a plot. It was very sugar coated. It barely went into detail in anything.

        "review_detailed_main": "I remember when Rice's book, INTERVIEW..., was released the FIRST time in the 70s. I was in junior high school at the time, read half of it, and tossed it in the bin to take its place with the rest of the trash. For the life of me, I never dreamed the book, one of the most poorly written I'd ever picked up, would be resurrected years later AND find an audience. So, all that said and bitchy as I am, I thought the film version of INTERVIEW... was abominable.\n\nI was particularly disappointed in this film because it was directed by Neil Jordan who, having worked with Angela Carter on THE COMPANY OF WOLVES, should have known better how to convey the eroticism and arcana of vampirism. Sadly, none of Carter's insight into vampire lore seemed to have rubbed off on him or Rice. As I mentioned, I never finished reading INTERVIEW; but, judging the film version on its own merits, it was as bad as the book; ultimately, a film of wasted opportunities and too much posturing; an exercise in pretentious presentation of a subject as if it is new and undiscovered; an assumption that its audience is too dumb to know more or better.\n\nBut QUEEN...is another story altogether. When I first saw the film's trailer, I groaned audibly, but, a few days later, I began to rethink it. Why was I taking it so seriously? Why didn't I just go see the film for fun, for fantasy, for Friday night and leave it at that? So I went to see it this evening, and I enjoyed it!\n\nI must admit, I'm not entirely sure why I enjoyed it. The opening credits sequence with its homage to DAS KABINETT... is, at this point, cliched. Townsend's accent is dodgy and his posing and sneering tiresome. Frankly, posturing, by a number of the film's actors, is a major flaw of this film. And there was just too much MAC and talcum powder all around and not particularly well applied, I might add. And was so much money spent on make-up that there was none left to pay a script editor or language coach with even a basic knowledge of French? Between all the different pronounciations of the name Lestat and such glaring mistakes as \"Je suis Lestat...\" I have to wonder.\n\nBut, on the plus side, there is a real heady dose of artful, decadent, old, and older, world arcana on display particularly when the narrative shifted, early on, to the vampirizing of Lestat and his first encounter with the gorgonized Akasha. Also, Akasha's later presentation is splendid, bizarre, beautiful, and grotesque all at once, and, as far as I'm concerned, worth the price of admission. Also, it was interesting to see a heroine who is hairier than the hero--adds a certain earthy frisson to the proceedings.\n\nHaving seen so many horror films and vampire films, in particular, I have to say that QUEEN's plot holds its own. Frankly, in terms of plot, I've never seen a thoroughly satisfying vampire motion picture; and, to make it easier on my willing suspension of disbelief, I find it best to approach them completely on their own terms. Sometimes it works--the enchanting vampire film VALERIE AND HER WEEK OF WONDERS comes to mind--sometimes it doesn't (see INTERVIEW...). QUEEN falls squarely in between, and it's just right for a Friday night."

But as it is, it feels a bit of a cheat to have a title like that and not really have her in it that much.\n\nThe movie concentrates on two other characters - and does not even convince us of their relationship. Don't get me wrong, we as viewers understand what we are supposed to feel, what the characters are supposed to feel for each other ... but we cannot really feel it. There is not much in the sense of chemistry. You could argue that it has to do with the fact that vampires do not really feel anything ... but it is a movie and that argument should not even be made at all.\n\nAlso as much as I love(d) Aaliyah, it is not like she adds that much. She does add sexuality, she does add sensuality ... but she also adds a bit of a weirdness ... and she or rather her character remains ... well \"hidden\" in a sense .... not just for the first half of the movie (and no pun intended) ... anyway, there may have been way more here, but I can only judge for what I got to see ... and what I saw was quite dissapointing."

Being a long-time Anne Rice fan, I found it hard to sit through this movie without laughing into my hand and the absurdity of many of the situations. My friends were constantly smacking me in the shoulder and telling me to shut up.\n\nThe story the writers came up with was quite good, but nothing like the original story. For instance, we don't have Lestat...we've got a Louis/Lestat combination. And what is Marius doing telling Lestat \"you must be dead to the world\" when he himself was an artist and art dealer, the majority of his interactions with THE LIVING??? Did they just not read the books? Where's Mekare? Um, last time I checked, she was the one that did away with Akasha, not Maharet... Lestat's just a little too straight for my taste in these movies...I mean, everyone knows that Lestat prefers the company of men, not Jessie...how else would you explain Marius, Armand, Nicki, Louis and David? and what's all this about Armand looking like a Def Leppard reject? Come on, people!!! This is nuts!\n\nBut Stuart Townsend makes a good Rock Star Lestat. The story, like I said, was good. I didn't think it was as bad as I had originally planned on...though I did have a few good laughs.\n\nAnd the music was good. I personally think Jonathan Davis did a great job creating music worthy of our Brat Prince, though it's a bit depressing that he doesn't sing on the soundtrack.\n\nI also liked the makeup. The post-drink blood was a little...um...FAKE! but that's beside the point. The overly-white, reflective skin on Lestat was pretty good.\n\nThe special effects were too much like The Matrix.\n\nThere's my two cents...sorry if I make anyone mad here, but it could have been done much better..."

        "review_detailed_main": "The gullible movie fan can always count on the Hollywood Sophists to mislead us all with a trailer. Upon viewing the trailer for \u0091Queen of the Damned', one would assume that since it boasted the late singer Aaliyah's final film debut, she would have quite the predominant role. Yet how presumptuous would be to assume that. For it is not the case, the singer's scenes in the film have been unevenly slashed since her death and she appears mostly in the final stages of the film. Yet, that is not to say that the film revolves around her character, for she is the titular character, but actor Stuart Townsend owns the film In this apparent sequel to \u0091Interview With the Vampire', Townsend portrays the character Tom Cruise made famous in the former film. In this Gen-X film, Lestat returns after a century of sleep only to find himself bored with immortality. Thus making way for Akasha, a 6000-year-old Queen Vampire who promises him much more than he could ever imagine. I must admit, expectations were low coming into this film. I am not an avid horror fan and do not find myself caring much for films of this caliber, yet many surprises were in hand upon the viewing of the film. Released by Warner Brothers, the film was certainly modestly budgeted but contained some great production values. The settings were elegant and the film captured a seemingly eerie yet graceful aura that did not make this film seem something it was not. Perhaps a borderline thriller, the film rarely makes an attempt to terrify. Yet tells a story of a vampire who awakens an ancient evil in order to search for more. The film opens in an interesting manner and makes us realize that we should take this film a little more seriously than at first glance. Lestat returns only to find himself in a rock Band and while the public thinks his Vampire gimmick is a front; Lestat has other plans that are conveyed by Townsend decadently immersing himself in the role of the lustful and bloodthirsty vampire. Director Michael Rymer (Perfume, In Too Deep) is at the helm of what appears to be his first mainstream film and certainly surprises. Though the script may be quite weak, and the visual effects may also be characterized as ordinary, the discerning viewer will notice a solid attempt at creating a haunting and at times enchanting tale about a vampire's quest for something that just might be unable to achieve. The film certainly has its' flaws, if dissected; the objective viewer will note the pacing will be a tad bland at times and many things seem to be too convenient. Yet the film does have an interesting cast including a surprisingly elegant and masterful French actor Vincent Perez as Lestat's mentor Marias. Lena Olin also joins the cast as the watchful aunt of Jessie (Marguerite Moreau), a fanatical Vampire Scholar who will stop at nothing at discovering the secrets of the nocturnal. As aforementioned, I was quite surprised at the outcome of the film. Based on Anne Rice's follow up Novel to \u0091Interview With the Vampire', the same sensual and erotic themes are contained within the film yet are handed gracefully. The film does not turn itself into a soft porn romp, but neither does it connect the sensuality to the cause. This in my view is one of the main conflicts within the film. The sensual undertones seem to be overshadowed by the film's explicit attempts to woo us with its' style and appeal. Furthermore, the film seems to be gearing itself towards a Gen-X audience. How can one tell? Listen to the soundtrack, heavy metal tracks bombard the viewer in the film and makes an attempt to connect to the grunge attitude encompassing the present day world. Yet, in relation to poorer films that have the same target audience, this film escapes the trap without the slightest pretense. Instead of overflowing itself with stupidity that it could have easily engulfed itself in, the film is embedded with an ambitious, admirable and tender eye that Rymer brings to the film. Is it the best film out there? No. Is it the best Vampire film? Leave that to \u0091The Lost Boys'. Just enjoy this film for what it is; a matinee-like thriller that looks great and that may surprise many.\n\nGiancarlo's Rating: **"

        "review_detailed_main": "A lot of people walk into \"The queen of the damned\" and ask where is Tom Cruise? Where is Brad Pitt? A lot have read Anne Rice and think \"why did they take 3 books into this film and leave half questions unanswered?\". So did I. There is far too much in Anne Rice that would get the poor woman into trouble if her writings were read by the man on the street that it was a reasonably safe bet to remove this religiously sensitive material from the film and work on the fun bits of \"how much fun can you have when you are a vampire\". It looks more like a \"Dracula is my friend\" than like the strong material where it came from but the whole remains very enjoyable.\n\nPhotography and set design in particular are exceptional and if you're not tempted to dress in black, leather jacket, piercing where nature can allow, well you probably never will. I guess young Goths will simply love this film and rush out buy something - anything provided it's black with silver on it.\n\nIn my view a very well done sequel that does not claim to be 100% sequel, and a fairly good use of a material which was not easy to get on screen."

Although I have fully outgrown Anne Rice's shallow, meaningless, and dull vampires, I still felt that her work deserved better than this.\n\nApparently, the filmmakers turned down her offer to pen the script for nothing. They should have been begging her to write a script for them! Not only does this film miss what little point the novel had, it also glosses entirely over everything that makes the characters what they are.\n\nWhile I am on the subject, what the hell is up with the casting directors? An afro (c)rap star as the queen of Egypt? What the *&!%? But wait, it gets worse! They cast a tall, gaunt New Zealander as her *African manservant*. Yeah, you heard me right. How ironic that, in the year that the second part of a highly faithful adaptation of one of the greatest books ever written is due out, they should peddle this unfaithful rendition of a trendy hack's work. I'll bet Stuart Townsend is rueing the day he left that other production."

Aaliyah,(Queen Akasha),\"Music of the Heart\",'99, plays the starring role as an old ancient Queen who is charmed by Lestat's bite on the hand and his sweet tasting blood. There is plenty of blood sucking and lots of french blood kisses going on constantly and all the hickeys a girl or guy could possibly give each other. Aaliyah, put her complete body and soul into this role and had a charm about her that I have never seen; it is a horrible shame that an airplane crash took her to the bigger Screen in the Clouds. Great modern day vampire film."

However, if - like me - you had read the series...you likely knew what you were getting into when you let your curiosity override your better judgement and watched this monstrosity.\n\nThe casting was so poor it was actually amusing. Lestat, whose blonde hair and ironically good-natured personality have been reduced to a sullen, uninspired and dark-haired Stuart Townsend. Akasha, a queen of the old-world nile...arrogant, and self-righteous, played by a R&B star whose take on the role seems to be her best (bad) Bela Lugosi impression. (Nile Hungarians?) The ever-pale and very red-headed Maharet represented by raven-haired Lena Olin?\n\nThe writers of this schlock also apparently didn't pay very close attention to the Cliff Notes they used for reference. Glaring omissions can be understood given the (ridiculous) challenge of combining two of the novels, however wholesale changes to the story abound...so much so I can't imagine how Rice let this horror into theatres without massive protest.\n\nToss in extremely poor acting, cheeseball atmosphere that would have Corman wincing, and enough Mtv trendy styling to host a Spring Break party...and I felt more than sufficiently punished for ignoring my instincts. I'm just thankful I didn't shell out any money for this."

        "review_detailed_main": "Vampire movies are a genre filled with many absolutely detestable movies. Sometimes a miracle happens and a Vampire movie can be very entertaining. But most of the time it turns out like \"Queen of the damned\": unwatchable.\n\nLestat (you know, the character from \"Interview with the vampire\") wakes up and needs a way to cope with todays society. He decides to become a rock star, and his music wakes up the \"Queen of the damned\". A vampire queen that has been asleep for centuries, now she wants to rule the earth with Lestat as her husband.\n\nThis movie displays almost everything that is wrong with Vampire movies. The acting first of all is terrible. Everyone walks around trying painfully hard to look cool in leather and rubber, most of them using thick fake accents since apparently no Vampire has ever learned to speak proper English. Worst here is Vincent Perez as the man who made Lestat a Vampire. Second of all it always seems that every film-maker doing a Vampire-movie has to try and introduce some sexual tension. Apparently Vampires are very seductive and alluring, something that the actors are usually completely inept at portraying. Stuart Townsend as Lestat falls completely flat in his attempt.\n\nThere has been much talk about Aaliyah and this film since it was her last role before her tragic death. But it's hard to comment her performance considering she was not actually on screen very much. Her thick accent was not flattering though and personally i wish she would have had something other than this as her last performance.\n\nThere is so much i could write about why you should stay away from this movie. But what's the point, it seems these movies have their loyal following no matter how poorly made they are. So i guess fans of the genre might as well watch it, while everybody else can stay far away from this. I rate it 3/10."

I can listen to the entire CD without skipping one song. That tells me it's kick-ass. I loved the movie because of obviously the vampires, but also it's so dark and dramatic and intense and erotic and romantic in a way. Taking everything into consideration, it's an incredible movie for anyone who is into vampires, hard rock, metal, Anne Rice, or action/horror films. I recommend it to anybody who is in the mood for a thrill ride."

But if you are going to make a movie based off a book or a series of books at least pick a shorter book or make a longer movie! Half the plot was missing! There are more characters in the book then in the movie, or so I thought. Half of them show up in the credits, but you'd never know they were there since there was hardly any character development. And what was the deal with Maharet and Akasha? Can we possibly get some clue as to their connection before we have this big showdown??? If you haven't read the books then you'll probably like the movie. I have to say once I let go of the whole \"it's not at all like the book\" thinking it was actually rather enjoyable. Stuart Townsend,in my opinion, was a great choice for Lestat especially compared with the ham job Tom Cruise did in Interview. Stuart actually came off as mysterious, sexy, and lethal. Aaliyah was beautiful as Akasha, but I think it would have come off better if they hadn't used sound effects to give her this big spooky voice. They had some good visuals and the soundtrack was very cool. I had to laugh at the bit spot they gave to Jonathan Davis as a ticket scalper. All in all not as bad as I expected. I will probably get the DVD and definately get the soundtrack."

Secondly, it should have been a trilogy or at least 2 longer movies.\n\nSo much was wrong with this movie, so I won't bore you with details and/or spoilers.\n\nI'll finish by saying and reiterating that it is entertaining and good vampire movie, it's just not the previously mentioned books...book fans beware."

However, after watching Queen of the Damned for the first time now, nearly 12 years after is release, I am intrigued by it's premise and will make time to go back and read both books. As for the movie, it is a middling affair. There are many positives, among them are Stuart Townsend's portrayal of Lestat, Aaliyah as Akasha, fantastic songs written specifically for the movie and a few stylistic flourishes here and there. I absolutely bought in to Lestat's hard rock persona. On a lesser note I couldn't help but make involuntary comparisons to Interview with a Vampire. Needless to say THAT is a better movie. Yet this movie could have been much closer in quality had some more elaborate choices been made in regards to special effects, a moodier screenplay and a greater focus on detail in general. There is absolutely zero tension or suspense in this film in thanks partially to it's metal music overload. I like the songs yet I feel that the dramatic scenes would have been better served with a more brooding or sinister soundtrack. Also, the climax was a bit rushed or underwhelming or trivialized. Not bad though."

Its a good thing Louis didn't show up, he would have been a downer for the movie. Sure there are things I missed that were in the books but I think Stuart Townsend's take on Lestat made up for it. Whew, he can suck on my neck any night. Remember this film is Lestat's story and don't expect Akasha (the late Aaliyah) to be in the majority of scenes and you'll come out feeling better about it.\n\nOn Aaliyah's performance let me just say she did very well with what she had to work with. She looked luscious and acted with regal abandon.\n\nI also enjoyed Vincent Perez as the ancient, Marius. He seemed to be a combo of Marius and Armand as I envisioned them. He certainly had Armand's playfulness and persistence.\n\nThe script was weak in parts and some of the special effects were a bit cheesy (think of that scene in Interview with the Vampire where Louis is pissed off and chops Santiago in half and burns the Theatre des Vampires down) nothing monumental and a bit low end. Oh well...\n\nMy advice is, if you like vampires go see it, give it a chance. Remember it is not Louis romantising via Anne Rice's pen and you'll enjoy it much more. Focus on Lestat and you'll be ready to surrender your mortality for a few sensuous minutes of life as an immortal rock star.\n\nDenise vv"

Well, it was well acted and visually beautifull. Lots of great special effects too. It's up and down, and as the title implies I don't know what to think.

The movie is wretched.\n\nI had read all the Vamp Chronicles books in the late 80s/early 90s and enjoyed them (had been on a horror fiction kick for a few years - conclusion reached; there was not much quality horror fiction in the wild). After Neil Jordan's \"Interview\" was released and experienced financial success, it seemed logical that \"The Vampire Lestat\" would be adapted for the big screen. Alas, said book was never adapted, even though it was a cornucopia of rich imagery and interesting mythology. Around 2000, I recall reading on a forum some hubbub about an adaptation of \"Queen of The Damned\" being greenlit. This news instantly cranked my cynicism to 11. How could a viable \"Queen\" adaptation be generated without providing the vital mythical foundation provided in the \"Lestat\" book?\n\nThe question was answered upon heading out to yonder theater in late February 2002; the studio was not concerned with creating a viable adaptation. The flick was foul. Absolute refuse. Embarrassing dreck. Devoid of any substance. An ideal example of Hollywood incompetence.\n\nLooking back, I'm surprised that I didn't walk out of the theater all those years ago.\n\nAdvice --> Run away from this failed effort. Watch \"Nosferatu,\" Bela (Lugosi, for you young ones) or one of the Hammer Drac flicks instead."

This movie doesn't even come close to portraying the Chronicles' characters, and in fact doesn't even include some of the most important people, leaving you with a bunch of vampires who just happen to have some of the same names.\n\nOn a light note, the soundtrack rocks, Lestat is looking delicious, and the over all scenery can be very beautiful. However, only the digital effects, makeup, and the music made this film even worth trying to satisfy one's curiosity.\n\nThe movie itself is very unstable. The characters are confusing, and Lestat even has the wrong accent; he's supposed to be French, but in the movie he's Irish. The narration was retarded. I felt myself looking away a few times because I couldn't even watch, and just sitting there laughing the whole time at the movie's absurdity. Like Townsend said, it really is a cheesy film.\n\nIf you've read the books, however, you're in for an inside joke with David and Marius. They've never even conversed in the books, but here they seem to really like each other- and just WHAT do those two have in common? :)\n\nDon't waste your time seeing this and buy the soundtrack. 2/10"

His physical portrayal of Lestat was dead on, but the way he said his lines just irritated me. Made me feel as if someone had seen one too many Bela Lugosi movies. Or perhaps he's seen Bram Stoker's Dracula one too many times; (b) the soundtrack. Music always makes a movie better. This was the best aspect of the movie; (c) Aaliyah as Akasha. She portrayed Akasha as you would want her portrayed -- vulnerable yet powerful, seductive yet coy, independent yet dependent (esp. dependent on Lestat's love, the love of her brood, etc. -- of course had they followed the book a little better this would have been more prevalent in the movie).\n\nMy advice -- buy the soundtrack (even though Jonathan Davis does not appear on it) SKIP THE MOVIE."

        "review_detailed_main": "THE DAMNED\n\nHonestly, this movie is really more about the Vampire Lestat, portrayed in an enticingly dark delight by Stuart Townsend. Lestat has been lonely too long; he decided to roam the earth in light among mortals. Against all other vampires consent, he became a rock star and exposed himself as a vampire, not to mention sharing deep vampire secrets to the mortal world. If you have read the book, Lestat has exposed himself before by becoming an actor in a theatre.\n\nIn the movie, Lestat was made by Marius, who left him in despair and loneliness, but not after he taught Lestat enough lessons to live in shadows amongst mortals. You might understand Lestat's loneliness and his delicious pompous b**tard attitude more if you read the book and realize that he was in fact made by Magnus, who killed himself just after he transform Lestat into a vampire. Lestat was probably one of the only vampires forced to roam the mortal world without proper introduction to vampirism.\n\nSo, what is the movie got to do with the Queen of the Damned? Basically, Lestat awakens Akasha who wants to rule the earth with demonic powers again as she did in the old days. Akasha, or She Who must be Kept is well portrayed by Aaliyah, although I must say, she does not have to be in this movie. I mean, she's only appearing in probably 15 minutes of the whole movie! I think they should just call this movie The Vampire Lestat and dedicate another separate movie to Queen of the Damned. Anyway, salute to Aaliyah who is very beautiful and graceful as well as demonic as Akasha. even though she could try a more Egyptian accent instead of the usual Vlad Dracul's Romanian/Hungarian accent...\n\nAnd finally, the rest of the characters. hmm. what can I say about the rest? Why oh why do you have to portray Marius to be so gay? I thought that Vincent Perez would be a good choice to play Marius, but Marius is not gay. I don't have any problems with gay community, but again Marius is not gay. And please tell me that the blond Leonardo DiCaprio look alike is not Armand, he who has been perfectly portrayed by Antonio Banderas in 'Interview'.\n\nTHE FORSAKEN\n\nA tribute to Goths all over the world, this movie is more of a Goth MTV celebration than an adaptation of Anne Rice's Queen of the Damned. First of all, this movie, which is far too short than its predecessor, Interview with the Vampire, is trying to capture both essence from The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned. I mean, if it takes more than two hours to describe one book in 'Interview' how could they thought to achieve 2 books in a less than two hours movie.\n\nNevertheless, it is, like I said, a tribute to Goths and as a Goth, I truly appreciate the music, the depiction of the band, Davis' cool voice and Stuart's wonderful stage performance. Stuart, you should really try forming a Goth band!!\n\nI truly despised the depiction of Lestat's tenderness towards Jesse by the end of the movie. This is not the Lestat I know, this is not the Lestat that was portrayed earlier in the movie. The Lestat that was afraid to bite when he sees blood. hello? What's going on here? And the Lestat that fly with too many sequences, especially the scene where he took Jesse for a flight. it made me think of Superman!\n\nOh, and the ending, where he walks hand in hand with Jesse, saying hello to David Talbot. what can I say. this movie is really just worth to watch to hear great music and see beautiful people like Stuart and Aaliyah. Think of it as a video clip with a story..."

        "review_detailed_main": "I must say that I went into this movie with mediocre expectations. Having heard the rumor that the film was almost scheduled for video release only, I doubted that it would be winning any Oscars. However, while I wasn't blown away, I can't say that it wasn't enjoyable. There was eye candy in Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah, some kick-ass music, and a middling story line. I was disappointed and misled, because I thought Aaliyah would have a larger role, but that couldn't be avoided. Some of the lines caught me halfway between a cringe and a laugh. I have to give some of the actors respect for being able to say them without wincing. And, of course, as any true fan of Farscape (a sci-fi TV show) I wanted to see the radiant Claudia Black on screen more often. But overall It was a decent movie that is just something to pop in the VCR and kill 2 hours with. Switch off your brain, keep your eyes and ears open and have some mindless fun."

As a film, it sort of spent 90 minutes getting started, just in time for Aaliyah to go \"RAR! I will kill you all!\" and then time for some more vampire-fu.\n\nA real shame that the depth and complexity of Ms Rice's better early Vampire novels were lost. Characters crossed the screen for no apparent reason, and only reformed goths like me could point and say \"oh, that's Mael\". In fact, the film bore so little resemblance to \"The Vampire Lestat\" and \"Queen of the Damned\" that they may as well have called it something completely different. So, no story, no development, poor pacing. But it's a very pretty film, and Stuart Townsend is a very pretty Lestat (better in some respects than Cruise). The stage fight is hilarious (watch out for the wires!). Paul McGann occasionally looks like he's asking himself what the hell he's doing in this film. Vincent Perez, on the other hand, gets all the best vampire lines and really made the film for me.\n\nOne for genre fans, but then we knew that."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is the worst movie I have seen in my entire life. I can't BELIEVE it has an INCREDIBLE 4.6 here at IMDb. That makes it the most overrated piece of crap E V E R. Makes me sick!\n\nAbout three years ago, I was fooling around with this hot blonde in my class. We had been back and forth because of her insane boyfriend, which kept me from reaching my goals. However, they were also back and forth, and she broke up with him (like fifty times, but this time it seemed to be for real). So she finally agreed to watch a movie with me some Saturday night, in my home. Sex was REALLY in the air, and I had been trying to get into her pants FOREVER. Get it? FOREVER, damnit! She practically said \"Hey, we should have sex after that movie we're going to see.\"... not that she hadn't been inviting before, but with the boyfriend out of the picture and everything, I figured this had to be it. And it probably would be..\n\nSo before she shows up I had to get downtown to rent a movie. I remember seeing K-PAX in the shelf, and this \"Queen of the Damned\". I also remember reading the word \"erotic\" in a bi-sentence or something on the (Norwegian) back cover. Seemed perfect for the occasion, so I rented it.\n\nI got back home, she showed up (first and last time she set foot inside my house). We started watching the movie. Needless to say, a movie has the power to change an atmosphere completely. It can be a great way to get things going with someone. It doesn't have to be sexual or romantic, anything exciting or just funny usually gets the atmosphere right for more flirting, and so on. Even some bad movies might work; if you can start making fun of it in some way, it might kill off the nervous tensions and break the ice.\n\nQueen of the Damned failed miserably at everything. Not only did it NOT break ANY ice, it killed off all hope by adding several layers! It seemed like we sat there for ten hours scratching our faces, not being able to communicate. When the pain was over, she left within 15 minutes.\n\nI can't describe with my poor English vocabulary how painful this movie was. I didn't get in anybody's pants, AND it was actually awkward to see her again the next Monday. As I'm typing this, she's pregnant with her about-seven-years-older-than-me-with-a-sports-car-and-tattoo dumb-ass new boyfriend. THANK YOU, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED!"

I personally have never read the book although I watched the movie with a friend who did and had to endure hours upon hours of her complaints and her \"NO!!! it's all wrong!!! *sniffle sniffle*\" five minutes into the movie I was LMAO and she was in tears because they destroyed her book, which apparently is a decent read. \"Where's Armand?\" she squealed angrily and that was just the beginning. Personally, I wanted to see Louis, as he was my favorite character in \"Interview,\" and she claims he was in the book. *sigh* they screwed up again. Leave it to hollywood to take a perfectly good vampire story and turn it into MTV's worst nightmare. yes it's sad to say that this corny excuse for a vampire movie actually entertained me sadder still is the fact that i wouldn't mind seeing it again. as for my friend, she's content with one of the two things they got right...the soundtrack...the second thing they actually did right was the wardrobe. If you're looking to me to see if you should watch this movie, ask yourself this one question: Would you like a little Cheese with that Whine??? if you don't mind the cheese and you haven't read the book you might just like it."

This is hard to accept for a vain vampire who constantly brags about his blonde hair and blue eyes. Many of the scenes in the movie never occur in the book and vice versa many of the scenes in the book never make it into the film. The action of the film actually combines part of another Anne Rice novel \"The Vampire Lestat\".

It's a fun kind of bad, especially when Lestat and Akasha are in a bathtub of roses for very little context, but ultimately, just watch the Crow or Blade, or hell Twilight is probably more well-structured plot wise than this."

But with whoever brought the book to the screen. Facts were wrong (Lestat's maker, for one) while some were altogether missing (the story of the twins). Where is Maharet's reason for wanting Akasha dead? Why a gudge to last 6000 years? What makes Akasha such a danger? Because she killed a few vampires who tried to attack her? Because she helped Lestat? These are questions the movie leaves you with. And Lestat? Where is his lust for the kill? Why turn him into Louis? Now, as much as it pulled from Anne Rice's novel, it was, unto itself, an entertaing movie. Townsden s amazing with the filmaker's version of Lestat and Aaliyah is grand as the doomed Akasha. Too much time explaing \"The Vampire Lestat\" and not enough explaining \"The Queen of the Damned.\" But fr all its cons, its still worth Aalyiah's acting. It will see my movie shelf."

I must rescue the performs of Marius and Lestat, (they did the best they could)keeping in mind the awful scripts. on the other hand i was totally disappointed with the performs of David Talbot, Akasha, and Jesse, Jesse and David felt kind of \"empty\" and Akasha is over acted. some important characters of the actual story were omitted as some of you have commented, but my biggest concern about the movie is that any of the characters show the true essence of the actual characters AT ALL!

Aaliyah Haughton succeeded in her role, which consisted of keeping her wig on and softly undulating in bronze bodypaint. there was little more required of the actors, looking good visually and possessing a vaguely badass attitude was enough in most cases, as it is in most music videos. life for a vamp is burdened by a never ending change of wardrobe and usually an irksome accent. not a lot of introspection here, which you would think a 400+ yr vampire would have had some opportunity for.\n\nthe other plot possibility was the \"meddling kid\" talamasca, a bit thin on the characterization, and somewhat unbelievable. one character followed her obsession to request full knowledge of the experience of a vamp. this woman, who we are to believe is DRIVEN for knowledge, rapidly backpedaled when offered the opportunity to become a vamp after a demonstration of \"a light snack in the park after dark\". this woman was an EXPERT, having studied lestat from his own DIARY, did she think he drank slim fast to stay looking so thin and chic? the fans of the Anne Rice books will be disappointed, as the story is further diluted by the direction and the choice to make this as flash as possible.\n\nroland s. howard and hugo race were featured in the film. look QUICKLY, as their role in the BAR band consists of a quick tracking shot in the \"admiral's arms\" and one fleeting close up reaction shot before he and the rest of the barflies buy the farm. go rent \"der Himmel \u00fcber Berlin\" one more time if you want more than this.

If you liked the book, spare yourself and let your imagination play the movie for you - you will enjoy it so much more.\n\nBut if you want to watch a slick movie that needs very little attention and you like a good perve and a few special fx, by all means go along and watch - but when you get the chance, read the book and see what you missed out on.\n\nPersonal note for Anne Rice.\n\nYou wrote such a fantastic, intriguing book.

        "review_detailed_main": "The festering scent of this movie still burns in my sinuses. Someone should stake the screen writer and the producers for releasing such a worthless, inept film upon this world. By the first hour I was wishing someone would put me out of what seemed to be the eternal misery cursed on me by the filmmakers.\n\nAs a writer myself, and a fan of Anne Rice; I expected much more. I at least hoped for an adaption even worthy of the other misguided Vampire flick based on her ever worthy series. Unfortunately I did not even get that. Instead we are presented with a rambling, pointless showcase of Jonathan davis's Music, which is not even up to par of his past forayes into the subject. We were given a descent performance by the late great Allyah who only had a total of 19 minutes screen time, that is unless you count the time she was a statue in the film. Even then her acting job was much better than the rest of the cast.\n\nbeing a published writer in this genre, I believe i know a little about the subject. Therefor I must say it is most unfortunate such a excellent novel could be misconstrued to the point that the very essence of the story is lost in the process. I dread seeing what they can do to ruin the best book of the series \"Minock THe Devil\" in its rumored upcoming production, I suggest the movie company look into hiring the screenwriter used for the flm adaption of Red Violin, another of Anne Rices great books, and the director of The Kindred series, that was based on the game Vampire of The Masquerade. At least both of these were worth 7.50 admission and the 2hrs of your life you will never get back. Because unlike the protagonist in this film, we do not live forever and therefor our time has value.\n\nMy final review: Put a stake in it. it's done. Now bury it where it will never have to be endured by another unfortunate soul."

The music was OK, if a bit done - I love industrial music, but would have liked something new. The concert scene was the worst. What was up with all the plastic props? OK, so you found a few Goths on the street and you think that qualifies you. I got so sick of hearing them say they were \"Goth\" Not that I would claim the sickening title, I just like black and hang out in basement clubs. Obviously the creative director of this movie didn't. First, Industrial does not equal Goth. Second, where was the dark, beauty? And everything else about the lack of continuity is true. The only people who like this film are Aaliyah fans who get off on seeing her squirm in a bikini. But she doesn't even do that much. And what is with the accents? After thousands of years you figure she could learn not to lisp through the teeth? And wouldn't hundreds of years old vampires have some power and intelligence. Lestat comes across poorly, but Marius is the worst. They do show him to be an accomplished painter, but gloss over the reason why and there is no other hint than any of the characters might actually have lived for some time. Isn't that the appeal of Vampires? Eternal life and all the benefits? This movie was a poor Hollywood standard action flick trying to stuff in too much intelligence. Somewhere along the line they should have made the choice between compelling drama and action. Instead the achieved neither."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is horrid. I could sum it up in a lovely gagging noise.\n\nNot only was the acting intolerable, but it was like they didn't even bother with reading the book. The book itself was never structurally made to be brought to the screen. The concept of a vampire rising from his 'sleep' to join a rock band, simply works better in writing then in moving pictures. Even if Tom Cruise himself hadn't passed over the role, it still would not even have risen near \"acceptable\". Tom Cruise was Lestat without a doubt. Townsend pretty much destroyed the character! He raped Lestat of his personality, his cunning, his wit, and every other trait we've come to adore him for. Townsend turned Lestat into nothing more than a jerk with an ego problem and a lust for groupie blood. Other characters were also maimed in the making of this film. Marius's portrayal especially made me cringe. In the books, Marius is a LONG BLONDE haired, BLUE eyed roman man. NOT, and I repeat NOT a short dark haired, brown eyed Spanish man!! I love Vincent Perez, he did wonderfully in \"The City of Angels\"...but failed miserably in \"Queen of the Damned\". Now another blaring moment, is that fact that a good share of main characters are MISSING. Louis and Armand do not make a reappearance. Gabrielle is gone. Maharet's sister is missing. Or in some cases characters were diminished. I believe I saw Mael at some point, but he was never given a name. Same with Pandora. I only knew she was in the movie because the credits told me so.\n\nWell there is so much more I could detail, but there is a word limit. Strictly speaking \"Queen of the Damned\" fell so far behind its predecessor that I don't blame Stuart Townsend for basically disappearing off the face of the earth. \"Interview with the Vampire\" is still the best, and probably always will be. If you have questions, read the book. You'll hate the movie too after that."

It was just a good movie for horror fans. I felt that it had good ideas and worked pretty well. With some new coming actors and a sexy performance of Aaliyah, the film really couldn't go wrong.\n\nWe have a new Lestat, Stewart Townsend, who is just now starting to be more noticed from his last film with Kate Hudsen \"About Adam\". A lot of people were disappointed that Tom Cruise did not reprise his role, but to be honest as much as Tom did a great job, he couldn't have fit this time into the Rock -N- Roll Lestat. Stewart captured that sexiness and that sleek look of cockiness that was just perfect. All though yes, I didn't really like the romantic side the director took on him, he's still one of our favorite vampires.\n\nAaliyah, no, she didn't have the look of Akasha, Queen of all that is damned. But she did a good job and was so incredibly beautiful. Her tragic death had just happened before they released \"Queen of the Damend\" into theaters, RIP! This movie captured her beauty and talent very well. She was so sleek and just sexy during her dancing scene in the pub with the other vamps before her massacre.\n\nThere was one very bothersome actress, the one who played Jesse. She did so badly! Her lines, were, she just... gah! She was horrible, you'll have to trust me on that. Otherwise, I think you'll enjoy it, please! Don't compare the book, I like to say to people that if you want the book, read the book. This is a movie and it's not always going to be faithful, it just wanted a hipper look for a younger audience.

From the viewpoint of someone who has read and enjoyed the books, and knows the storyline, and Anne Rice's descriptions of the various characters, this was a truly bad movie. Essentially, it was a strange melding of the two books (The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned), which neglected many of the elements that made the stories enjoyable and interesting in the first place. In the case of Queen of the Damned, massive parts of the storyline were left out even though they were main portions of the plot of the book. It was badly miscast, with most of the actors nothing like the descriptions of their characters in the books. They even had the vampires' fangs on the wrong teeth! The main thing that leaves me puzzled about this movie though, is how they could call it \"Queen of the Damned,\" when, in actuality, the storyline centered around the main plot of \"The Vampire Lestat.\"\n\nDespite the many, many faults, it could be enjoyable, provided one had not been an avid fan of the books. Stuart Townsend, despite his physical differences from Lestat, was excellent in his portrayal of the vampire. But other than that, I have nothing good to say about this movie, except that it would be fun to go see it again, just to yell at the screen whenever something strayed from the books. Unfortunately, that would leave me quite hoarse."

Even if you haven't read the books, the movie is just too much of a mess to recommend. The plot jumps around randomly, characters are cardboard, acting is rather feeble, and it feels much longer than the 90 minutes running time. Many of the major characters from the books (Pandora, Armand, etc.) are not even referred to once by name. They were badly cast and the only fun I had was to guess who they're supposed to be. Aaliyah was channeling Bela Lugosi as Akasha, that's was funny. So, why did I even give it 3 stars instead of 1. Well, at least it doesn't look cheap, that deserves one star. The special effects on the vampire movement is pretty cool and interesting, that's another star. The fact that they mangled the amazing source material so thoroughly is a feat worthy of another star!"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Queen of the Damned\" is a vampire movie that sort of have me divided into two camps. The first is that the movie is actually fun and entertaining enough, and it does have some nice aspects to it. The second is that \"Queen of the Damned\" is actually one of the corniest and most stereotypical of vampire movies out there.\n\nNow, I haven't read the book upon which this movie is based and sculpted, so how true the events and characters were to what Anne Rice constructed, I have no idea.\n\nThe story in \"Queen of the Damned\" is about Lestat, a vampire coming out in the open and proclaiming himself a vampire to the world in conjunction with promoting his band. A ruse to call out the elder vampires.\n\n\"Queen of the Damned\" is entertaining enough for what it turned out to be. Campy and cheesy, certainly, but there still was something entertaining to it. However, the storyline was bordering on being ridiculous and did have some gaping plot holes here and there. And there is a frightful similarity between the Lestat and Jesse characters and the Edward and Bella from \"Twilight\". And that sort of was just ridiculous.\n\nIt is the atmosphere of the movie that works out for the best, because there is sort of a gloomy goth-like atmosphere to the movie.\n\n\"Queen of the Damned\" feels like a fan service movie through and through. And the movie never shook that mantle, and it wasn't particularly promoting the enjoyment of the movie.\n\nStuart Townsend (playing Lestat) was really carrying this movie, and this was definitely his movie in every aspect. And while Aaliyah certainly was great in the villainous role (playing Queen Akasha), then it was hard to take her serious when she was moving. Vincent Perez (playing Marius) was also adding a lot of flavor to the movie, despite having a minor role also.\n\nThis is an entertaining enough movie, but hardly a vampire movie that stands out as being memorable."

What I saw was a man attempting to recreate a Monet (my own favorite artist) and ending up with something that resembled roughly a mangled corpse's viscera thrown at an old yellowed canvas. I use a rather graphic example, I understand that, but it is only to appropriately present my concerns. I think all the fans would have much rather enjoyed a movie 3 1/2 to 4 hours long giving us a whole and accurate story. Even if the actors from the the \"prequel\" (IWTV) could not be hired to play their old positions, the least that could have been done was to match the style of makeup and mannerism that the vampires beheld. It's an insult Mrs. Rice and to \"us\".. the \"outcasts\"..."

Honestly I had low expectations going into this movie and i was not let down. This movie really left me asking a bunch of questions, it left so many loose strands that probably someone not familiar with Anne Rice novels (like myself) do not understand. The premise was pretty interesting I thought...Lestat coming back into the public eye through a Goth Rock band. A very smart and modern type of way to go, and you would figure in your head if an immortal vampire did exist in our time it stands to reason that he would probably be a member of a Goth rock band. Unfortunately the union of Lestat and a band seems really rushed. We get introduced to an even older vampire Marius, whose past seems very interesting but you feel cheated because they do not even develop this character at all. Its all about the good looking/modern vampire Lestat and any other vampires in this movie are secondary because they are not as good looking as Stuart Townsend. The late Aaliyah was beautiful in this movie, she really did look goddess like but her role was a bit short and underdeveloped too i felt, more Aaliyah would have been a good thing. This movie really felt like it was targeted to the TRL audience ages 13-18 so if you fall below or above that or are not a HUGE Ann Rice fan skip this damned movie."

A friend who I dragged along said that it all looked \"like a big video game\" referring to the vast number of scenes that span across a large terrain making it look and feel like you're inside.\n\nTo start I must say that Stuart really captured the \"Lestat\" look, he very sexy as my friend remarked, and I must agree, wow!!! I did not see anything wrong with his accent I actually enjoyed his part the most in the whole movie. He captures Lestat and his wayward ways perfectly, and his skin looks beautiful in the movie. The concert scene was very well done and the song \"System\" playing along, while Akasha killed the vampires, was a nice touch. The little Jesse was adorable and the grownup was also compelling. Marguerite Moreau pulls off her part with a lot of flair and innocence, she's probably the only innocent in the whole movie. Akasha was physically enchanting though it was hard to make out the dialogue especially when she and Lestat were on the beach. Even though her role is not overly large she holds your attention when she is on screen. I enjoyed the scene when Lestat crawl away from the groupies and then crawls up the wall, very nice. Also when Lestat is listening to music lying in his coffin and then he realizes another vampire is in his mansion that is also very for lack of a better word, yummy :). The ancients who were barely featured seemed very reserved and not enough lines for them all, if they had any. I counted only about three lines from Armand, and Matthew Newton did resemble a \"pretty girl\" as my friend interjected. I think he was a pretty good Armand in appearance, he did not speak enough to find out if his character was very complex and dark, like it is. I like that Lestat calls his band \"my children\", very paternal and sweet of him, if Lestat can ever be sweet :) Also his biting sarcasm and humor worked well for the movie especially the line: \"Sorry I'm late, I was trying to catch my breakfast.\" And when Maudy (a band member) first saw Lestat and was surprised about his statement that he was a vampire: Maudy-\"Vampire, that's funny.\" and Lestat's reply: \"Yes, it's hilarious.\" Some of the special effects were a little shoddy and I'm not sure why but the way that the preternatural speed was conveyed was a little funny looking. Overall the movie deserves recognition for all the hard work put into it by everyone. I don't think it's fair to judge it so poorly especially because of the fact that it wasn't what you expected."

First of all, there was way too much emphasis put on Jesse; I didn't care about her when I read the book, and secondly, Lestat (through no fault of Stuart Townsend), came off as possessing precious little personality. The fact that Lestat didn't have blonde hair is rather unnerving, but I am willing to forgive that blunder simply because Stuart Townsend is REALLY frickin' hot! Also, in comparison to \"Interview with the Vampire\", which was handled with oodles of class, this one came off feeling kinda cheesy, and I found myself laughing at times I probably wasn't supposed to. I will give the writers a smattering of credit though, simply because they had a hell of a lot of characters and events to squeeze into 100 minutes. All in all, the movie wasn't a total disaster, but it left me feeling pretty let down."

It certainly makes for a smoother plot to shift the credit for Lestat's creation onto Marius; after all, it gives the viewing audience a much more credible motive for Lestat's seeking him out, at least more credible than an insane vampire \"turning\" Lestat and immediately immolating himself. But what is completely irreconcilable in such a compaction of two novels is the altering of the protagonist's basic character. Lestat, in his own words, prefers to feed on evil low life types. It is just this predilection which sets into motion the events of Memnoch the Devil. And yet we see him preying on the innocent at least twice in this film.\n\nAnd what have we lost in this foul and pestilent congregation of vapours? The story of Lestat. Allusions through wolfskin rugs just don't cut t. -- Marius and the making of Armand; the mystique of \"Those Who Must be Kept\" and Rice's take on the true origin of vampires, a good story in itself set in ancient Egypt. -- Lestat's friend Nikki and the origin of the Theatre des Vampires; and, integral to Lestat's character, his struggle with the concept of the world as a Savage Garden.\n\nTo me, it's a terrible tragedy that movies like this make it to perhaps a much wider audience than the books they're based on. The Vampire Chronicles have established Anne Rice as a crafter of stunning prose filled with sumptuous imagery, and horrors that are not so much visual as they are emotional and spiritual. Those of us who know her characters long for more of her stories about them, and to us, this movie is a rude insult."

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw this film last night at a free sneak preview. I have to say that while I was entertained, there were some things about the film I did not like.\n\n1) The acting is sub-par all around. Aaliya may have been a gifted musician (I'm not familiar with her music, so I don't know), but she was a horrible actress. Townsend was not much better. Considering that these two are the top-billed cast members should prepare you for the lackluster performances from the rest of the cast.\n\n2) I have never read any of Anne Rice's \"Vampire Chronicles\" so I don't know what specifically was cut out for the screenplay. What I do know is that they obviously cut out too much. There is too much that is not explained adequately on screen. It was plainly apparent that many sub-plots had been deleted, and therefore, a lot of potential was wasted.\n\n3) The score, in several places, became an annoyance as the music \"dramatically\" elevated to a piercing screech that only made me wince in pain.\n\n4) The eye makeup of the vampires in the movie made me wonder how they have managed to stay secret for so long, being that they all look alike. They all had the exact same discoloration at the corners of their eyes (near the nose). Visually, it was very distracting and failed at making the vampires look otherworldly - it looked more like that crud that forms in the corners of your eyes while you're sleeping.\n\nNow, all that being said I feel the movie is not a complete waste of time. Aaliya, while not a great actress, is certainly pleasing to the eye. And there is enough action and special effects to keep the lukewarm plot going until the end. See it at an early matinee and save a little cash.\n\nI gave it a 5 (out of 10)."

Her exact words I can't even put here, they are really that bad. The plot line changes from the book didn't work in the movie, they made no sense to anyone. From the changes in how Lestat was made a vampire to the ending (while visually stunning) left the viewer with too many disjointed fragments that never make any sense. Akasha (Aaliyah) did a great job, but it is sorry to note that is about all I can say of the cast (maybe the cast members should have read the book instead of watching a few vampire movies for their inspiration). An `A' for effort to the writers and producers in not fearing the ` Rice Wrath ` in making changes to the story line, but sorry you Flunked out because they didn't work. Lestat (Stuart Townsend) ends up looking like a rip off of Jim Morrison of the doors. The Talamasca looks like some sort of thrown together club for a `Hidden Camera' show. I kept waiting for Marius (Vincent Perez) to start rapping and putting on the `Colors', or at least steal a car throughout the entire thing. As for the rest of the cast, well, who was the rest of the cast? While the other members in the book are an integral part of the ending, they are no more than cheerleaders that could have been completely skipped in the movie and no one but a Rice fan would know.\n\nIf you are a dedicated Anne Rice fan, wait for the Bargain Shows to have it, or the video store.\n\nIf you know nothing of the Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice, then you may B rate the movie at best, although much mind altering drugs may help that rating."

But it doesn't make much of a plot.\n\nMy first major problem is the music. I have the feeling that when Ann Rice wrote \"The Vampire Lestat\", the Cure was more the style of the music he would have liked (though I could be wrong). I know relating to current \"goth\" music might have seemed like a good idea, but they did a horrific job incorporating it. Lestat was an actor with presumably a pretty good singing voice. That they chose Jonathan Davis to be his stage voice is heartbreaking.\n\nSecond, and someone else said it, mashing two very intricate books into one crappy movie is a bad idea. \"Lestat\" could have been a movie in it's own right, and a damn good one if done right. I honestly don't think \"Queen of the Damned\" lends itself to a movie very well. Though I would love to see a movie that incorporates a creation story, there's too much, how to word this, \"inaction\" in the book for it to be a very interesting movie. And the retelling they did soiled it pretty badly. Now mind you, it's been a long time since I've read it, I always thought \"Lestat\", \"Tale of the Body Thief\" and \"Memnoch the Devil\" were much more action packed and would have made better movies.\n\nI know a lot of people (hey, myself included) who like a lot of cheesy vampire crap that thought this was absolutely the worst of the genre to be a major motion picture. I tend to agree with them there. Aaliyah had a nice body though."

The dialogue was so vampire cliche, and the plot was so nearly non-existent that it played like fan fiction. Bad fan fiction. As for the cast, Stuart Townshend is unbearably sexy, but I can't help feeling that all of the actors were directed to exhibit no feelings and to walk around in \"i'm a vampire\" mode. I was disappointed that such a vital, sexual actor was misused. Overall, if you go into this knowing you're about to witness a train wreck, it can be an enjoyable experience."

As an avid fan of the Vampire Chronicle books by Anne Rice, I wonder how she ever allowed her name to be put on such complete and utter crap.\n\nThe absolute plot inconsistencies are completely ridiculous. It is as if the writers took the book, read it, and threw it out the window before beginning the screenplay. I would understand some small omissions in order to condense a long book into a movie, but drastically changing the integral plot points (such as individual vampires' makers, lovers, and friends) is completely inexcusable.\n\nThere were only 2 things that I can even imagine complimenting in this movie. First, the soundtrack. With bands like Disturbed, Orgy, and Korn on board, the driving rock of The Vampire Lestat was perfectly set. Second the performance of Stuart Townshend was terrific. As I read the books, I formed a mental picture of Lestat. Tom Cruise wasn't it. Stuart Townshend was. From the patterns of speech to the latent sexuality, to the dark beauty, he was everything Anne Rice described in her hero Lestat. Townshend's acting was the only reason I gave this a 2 instead of a 1."

If it was anything like \"Interview with the Vampire\" (which was pretty darn good, even though there might have been some deviations from the book), it had to be good stuff. For all those Anne Rice fans out there, prepare to be sorely disappointed. Better yet, save yourself the pain and just avoid this film altogether. Then again, if drastic plot reworkings are your thing - go right ahead. But if you are expecting the cinematic brilliance and glamor of \"Interview\" or \"Bram Stoker's Dracula,\" forget it! First off, the casting director should be shot. Obviously he/she is completely unfamiliar with the vivid world of vampires and creatures of the night lovingly crafted by Anne Rice. Marius and Pandora are grotesque parodies of the stunning characters in the books. Armand is a joke. Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah were the only saving grace - however, Aaliyah (gorgeous though she is) commands none of presence and authority of the vampire queen. The special effects make me want to watch Ghoulies 3 all over again. Second, although this would have been a challenging screenplay for anyone to write, the writer does a useless job of establishing the characters and their motives. For those who have never read the books, it's like being thrown into the final act of an intricate detective plot - there's no establishment of characters, plot, or intent. Marius and Armand have always fascinated me - I wanted to cry after I watched this film...from frustration. Enough said. Do yourself a favor and avoid this sad piece of celluloid. Until someone (once again) treats Anne Rice with the respect she deserves. Len Wiseman, James McTeigue, Zack Snyder, Gore Verbinski....are you listening???"

He brought much more charisma to the character than Cruise did and I enjoyed his on-screen presense more.\n\nUnfortunately, it is the late and great Aaliyah's last movie (unless they use her few filmed scenes in the Matrix 2), but she definately proved herself as an amazing actress in this film (and Romeo Must Die); better than all of the other singer-turned-actors. It's a shame she is only in about 20 minutes of total screen time (the ONLY disappointment with the movie)\n\nThe movie was just awesome. It had amazing special effects that enhanced the great plotline BASED ON, but not exactly interpretted from, the book. Queen of the Damned is the best vampire/horror movie I've seen in a while.

The rest of the film is terrible, Stuart Townsend is a really bad choice for Lestat.\n\nTom Cruise made the character his own in Interview with the Vampire and Townsend completely changes the way the character was. Lestat was a cold blooded killer and was still happily killing at the end of the last film. Are we supposed to believe that because of rock music he somehow reconnected to his human side. Some of the music was just about ok to listen to, but it's not life changing. If the names weren't the same you really couldn't connect Queen of the Damned to Interview with the Vampire at all\n\nI haven't read the source material, but I do believe that in the book Lestat becomes a rock star. In my opinion that was a rubbish idea to begin with. Maybe the film makers should have just got permission to use the characters names then make up their own story instead."

Anne Rice created the perfect anti hero ... child like, living life (or death) to the fullest, sexy, seductive and of course evil.... but not always evil, just when he feels like it. \"Interview with the Vampire\" (the movie) had the mood of the first book, had the darkness and the sensuality and it had the pain of Louis. It also included a bit of the homoerotic theme that is so prevalent in Anne Rice's books. \"Queen of the Damned\" is lighter more full of fun, and that was perfect because Lestat had none of the pain and deep internal struggle of Louis from the first book/movie. Did it capture the mood of the book? Well, no. It was sexy and the actor who played Lestat was PERFECT!(Stuart Townsend) He was lithe and sexy and smoldering and devilish in short the brat prince himself.... Basically Tom Cruise's performance as Lestat is rendered lackluster after seeing this guy.... Now the rest of the movie: <sigh> Well, if you love the characters and the story of The Queen of the Damned (the book) then you will be disappointed, because this does not follow the story at all.... no Daniel, no Louis, Lestat is Marius's fledgling and they basically take Armand's story of becoming a vampire and turn it into Lestat's re- birth... Only one ancient red head instead of the twins of the book, and she is played by Lena Olin (who does not have red hair....) I'm not sure which one of the Vampire Coven was Armand.... but in the credits he is listed so apparently he was there... and finally Aaliya, she was not good and that breaks my heart since she is no longer with us, she was so beautiful, much like all the Anne Rice characters are supposed to be, sweet, pure and lovely.... Very disappointing performance as Akasha. So see the film for the sexiness, see it for the Stuart Townsend, the man who plays Lestat, or for the fun music ( sounds like Korn) but if you are a fan of the book, don't expect the story you loved, it is not there.\n\nFor horror fans it is great fun, violent but over the top violence, for anyone else I would give this a pass, I'm sure the story is even more confusing if you haven't read the book."

The story on which the movie is based on, is very interesting and offers a possibility of a dramatical, visually powerful Vampire flic.\n\nWell, and after that, most things went wrong.\n\nFirst of all, the script is BAD. Scenes which could be giving dramatic thrills are scripted to boredom or even TOTALLY OMITTED! Akasha's second awakening, for example, is brought into the story by Marius saying: 'Oh well, yeah, she just woke up, y'know...' This is NOT dramatic. In other moments, the dialogue is so stupid you don't have the slightest idea of what is going on, for example when the part with the Family Tree is 'explained'.\n\nSecondly, there are only two people in this movie which could be called 'actors' (Townsend and Perez) and they, well, 'do their best'. Aaliyah just shows her body and beckons around in her stupid accent and could as well just be replaced with an animated character from Final Fantasy. The rest of the actors are, on the main, forgettable. Marguerite Moreau simply makes you wanna run out of the cinema and does make you think about Lestat's motives: How can he want to spend eternity with this BORING BORING person? The actor quality does the part to the film which is the greatest sin for a movie wanting to have some drama: You don't care about anyone, except maybe for Lestat. Even the beach covered with corpses does only make you feel glad you didn't experience them alive, 'cos they probably would have been bad actors, too.\n\nI gave this movie 5 out of 10 because, well, Townsend tries REALLY hard, and I really liked the music part (Jonathan Davis does a good bit here). Besides, the scene with thousands of fans approaching the concert is stunning. The movie design is also very good.\n\nWell, maybe the next Chronicles movie is made by the right people. I DO hope so."

First of all this is not a \"sequel\" to \"Interview with a Vampire\" this is the third book in the series. Therefore the director had to give some kind of background (mostly made up but loosely based on the book \"The Vampire Lestat\") on Lestat and the other vampires present.\n\nThe movie in directing and screen play was Excellent. The voices were great and for people who said there wasn't enough of the vampire queen in the movie... well Aaliyah died before the editing was done so forgive them for that!\n\nTo end the movie in my opinion was an A+. Mainly because it wasn't based on the book. When I read the vampire Lestat and queen of the damned the way I pictured things in my head the way Anne Rice intertwined the language she used is in no way re creatable on screen. The movie was a great \"original\" idea\n\nPlease go see it and do not be discouraged by these reviews."

Is there anything more tiresome than the whole goth-vampire cliche? We've seen it all before, folks, and there's nothing new here. Aaliyah manages to light up the screen for a very short time, but is given very little to do... a sad note for her career to end on. There is no atmosphere, no real tension, and none of the sensuality that made \"Interview with a Vampire\" such a pleasure. This isn't even a sequel, having one inconsistency after the next from the first film, but rather a cheesy, midnight-movie knock-off. Catch it on video if you must, but then only after a few glasses of merlot."

        "review_detailed_main": "Now first to the obvious, this film is inseparably linked to the tragic demise of Aaliyah, which is playing Akasha the Queen of the Damned.\n\nThis has directed some attention to it.In case of The Crow, the film has gained its special status to its Fans due to the Death of Brandon Lee during the making ... and both films have more in common than that.. I love both and both touched me, though Queen of the Damned took some time to do so, it did not when I saw it in the cinema first. It did as I rerented it for some reason I am still not really sure of, maybe because I love everything that is connected to Vampires and if I do not find a movie to watch I like to return to watching one of those I already know... and this one I had not seen as often as the others, well - now I have it in my collection and it is one of the most stressed DVDs.\n\nTo the plot: Vampire Lestat is not the usual kind of Vampire. Supposed to seek the night he yearns for being among the living, cannot understand why he as one of the powerful kind has to hide and be lonesome as seems to be his fate. So one day he lays down to take a time out of a hundred years and awakes in the London of the present. He sees it fit to finally do as he always pleased, he joins a punk band playing in the ruins of his old house (or rather makes them join him)and with the help of his Vampiric charisma then turns famous, groupies yearning to be bitten by him not really aware what that means... but that is not enough to him, he openly states to be Vampire, breaking the rules of his kind, telling of their secrets in his songs and challenging the other of his kind. Those are afraid of a world aware of them and seek out to kill him. Lestat is not alone though, there is an organisation dedicated to observe the Vampires and among those there is a female apprentice who slowly succumbs the aura of Lestat. And there is the ominous queen of the Vampires, Akasha, who once ruled the earth with terror, living a life in the open, who one day with her King went to a sleep over the millennia as they were simply bored with their life. Sensing in Lestat the same yearning to be out in the open she is awaking and looking for her new king after she killed her old mate asleep. Lestat finds himself between two women, the Vampire Queen that was born Vampire, has incredible powers and offers him his share of those on her side, seeming to offer all he always wanted and the feeble and soft woman, mortal and still fascinating him with her yearning of joining his kind or die in the effort.\n\nI think Aaliyah is presenting us with a very attractive and credible Queen of the Vampires. I also think her role in this film is overstated, in the title as well as in many comments. She is contributing to the plot exactly what is needed and not more. I join others in the statement that for her, this was an ungrateful last film. She will not be remembered because of it like Lee will be for the Crow, but not because this is a bad movie, only because her role simply is not the central one. The central person is Lestat and his way through time. So we learn about his making, his dissatisfaction with his Vampire fate, making him the murderer of those whose attention and worship or even only company he craves and then the sort of suicidal decision to challenge all of his kind with breaking unwritten rules and do as he feels compelled to. This almost suicidal tendency he has in common with Jesse, the girl that has been raised under ominous circumstances and does seek the Vampires for reasons she herself fails to understand, there they are alike.. they are driven, forced to act in a way that other warn them is beyond reason and would lead to their destruction.\n\nThis movie is fascinating in many ways. First there is the music, a score full of singers of bands like Orgy, Excess, Marilyn Manson.. something you not really would expect with a Vampire Movie, but really working well in exchange with the classical tunes one would expect, going along with the plot of the film and being of importance, not only some background aspect as in most movies.\n\nSecond we have those main characters that really are well composed. Aaliyah personates the totally inapproachable cruel ancient Egyptian goddess returning on earth to spread terror again in a way she could not have done better.\n\nStuart Townsend is making Lestat a sinister and profound creature of the night, wrestling with what contradicting emotions he is exposed to without getting a whiner. His way to interpret Lestat is superior to Cruise's performance in the prequel \"Interview with a Vampire\".. for what reason ever. (IMHO this role here would have been asked too much of Cruise)\n\nMarguerite Moreau is making us almost feel Jesse's fascination, making us understand why she is the moth drawn into the fire and accept it as in its own twisted way logical.\n\nThe plot is not as action packed as many would like and it is dwelling in its slow moments as well, it is a film you are drawn to on an emotional level and either it accomplishes that with you or it does not. What I love most though is its subtle humour and that not everything is stated obviously. Sometimes less is more, that has been proven to be true with this film again. It is a classical like or distaste case, I think. I for one love it."

My advice - buy the books and forget the film ever existed."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is the most recent adaptation of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. Lestat has arisen after a hundred years of 'sleep' to become a rock star. His music reveals names and secrets of Vampires the world over, enraging the entire vampire community. Akasha, the mother of all vampires, has been awoken from her sleep by Lestat's music. She decides to make him her consort and resume her rule as Queen of the Damned.\n\nFirstly, Michael Rymer needs to be chased naked through nettles by a pack of rabid dogs. Secondly, When Anne Rice offers to do your screenplay for free, ACCEPT! Then you might end up with something that amounts to more than a prolonged music video for a very bland and childish character. And that's what Stuart Townsend's Lestat is. Yes, he's gorgeous, and OK, his Creole accent's passable, but how do you follow on from one of the most amazing portrayals of Anne Rice's most beloved vampire? Quite simply you don't. (Tom Cruise spoils it for everyone again.) Bit of a shame, because Townsend does have his moments. He is very slick and sexy in the music video segments of the movie, but with dialogue as inane as this screenplay's it's hard to make a character believable when he spouts idiotic lines like \"Boo Back\u0085\" not much of the sensuality, egotism or charm of the original character remains in this version \u0096 this time around, Lestat is a whiny, tantrum-throwing angry young man. And there's a big difference between hammy acting and lack of talent. So it's a bit of a shame the whole movie centres around him, really.\n\nAaliyah's portrayal of Akasha is good, although she unfortunately does little more than squint in a sinister way, belly dance about in a small metal bra and set other vampires on fire. Aaliyah's acting \u0096 dodgy Egyptian accent aside \u0096 is probably the best in the movie, but again, she's that underused that her character loses her menace. After a while she's just this pissy bitch who wants her own way all the time. Which is a true shame as her motives in the book do actually have a point. And to say this movie's title is Queen Of TheDamned, said Queen is curiously shoved into the sidelines, and the movie becomes more about Lestat's rise to rock superstardom and his moral struggles. Akasha's attempt to regain her rule over the world of Vampires is almost an afterthought.\n\nThe rest of the vampire alumni included in this movie were, on paper, really rather exciting (for a vampire novel-reading geek like me). Marius, Maharet, Mekare and Armand are all included (apparently) but harshly overlooked, and dismissively underused. No time is spent on these characters at all, despite them all being some of the most important in the story and for those who haven't read the books, there's probably a certain amount of who-the-hell-are-these-guys?-syndrome happening. It's almost like the writers took a pair of garden shears to the book, put it through a blender and then filmed what was left. Yes, the sets, costumes and makeup effects are good, the Death Valley concert scene is well done, but the whole movie dithers about for 97 minutes, unsure as to whether it's following the' Queen of the Damned' or 'The Vampire Lestat' plot lines. A tad ambitious I feel. And look what happened. The movie falls flat on its face with all it's glamour, black leather, body piercings and tattoos in a heap around it. And I just want to stand pointing and laughing."

And married with Stuart Townsend's wooden acting is some laughably bad dialogue. Ascetically, it comes off like a big budget tele-movie.\n\nDo yourself a favour and rent 'Near Dark' instead.\n\nNOTE: You know a film's in trouble when the author of the book (Ann Rice) offers to help with writing the and they turn her down."

When i saw that, my jaw dropped open, and I must admit that my friend had to scoop my chin up off the floor. Even after that Marius doesn't show the caves to Lestat, Lestat simply tumbles in. Not to mention Akasha simply raises her palm to let Lestat, as opposed to thrilling spectacle described in the book. Instead of Enkil turning to \"glass\" The statue has its neck slashed through, and is still made of clay. Lestat doesn't meet up with Louis or Gabrielle before the concert. I could go on and on and on into an oblivion.. which i must admit, i have already done.. but i'm going to stop now. Please Anne Rice fans, don't waste your time and money.\n\nHOWEVER, i'm sure that if i did not know of the book, or did not read the book, the movie would be rather thrilling.

Yes, I have read the books (all the way up to `Memnoch the Devil'), but I was fully aware that, unlike the film version of `Interview With A Vampire', `Queen's screenplay was not written by Anne Rice nor did any of the stars from that project appeared in this cinematic installment. But I am not going to get into how much the film diverted from the book (which is expected with adapting one format to the other) but on the film alone. Rest assured, other Anne Rice fans have already nit-picked by now, already. ;)\n\nFirst off, the acting was not bad. Aalyah was the PERFECT Akasha and deserves any awards she is nominated for this role, her last performance.\n\nStewart Townsend was, visually, a superb Lestat, however, his excessive posing and blank `Bono-like' stares were just a little annoying and got in the way of his performance in some scenes. The rest of the cast did workmen-like performances.\n\nHowever, I fault mostly the script, which was, in of itself, hard to follow. For a movie titled `Queen of the Damned' we know far more about Lestat than we do Akasha. So much is left out that even HOW she became a vampire (the Mother of ALL Vampires, at that) is missing! Plus, there's the attempted forced love interest between Lestat and the mortal Talamascan Jesse, the rather rushed flash-backs of Lestat's past, and other undeveloped characters (did anyone even KNOW that the other three vampires were Pandora, Armand, and Mael?). Add to the confusing focus of the direction of the film (is this a Vampire flick, a Alternative/Goth Video, or a kung-fu/Buffy the Vampire flick?) with its nausiating, overused crane and helicopter shots for most of the scene changes, you have a patch-worked film that just feels as though it was rushed to be released and tried to compensate (and failed, CGI and all) substance with style."

As well, each movie is, in itself, a different story. Remaining true to the novel is not always possible, and is sometimes impossible due to time constraints and intricacies of plot development that do not come easily to the screen.\n\nHaving said this, I believe the movie was very well done, and captured the characters' personalities quite well. The interpretation from the original book was appropriate, even if some of the characters' roles had to be left out. The sets were lush and the camera work was well done, providing a lot of eye candy for most scenes. The acting is effective and thought provoking.

And I could spit in the face of anyone who dares compare Stuart Townsend to Tom Cruise. There's no contest. Tom understood the character, felt for him, became him. Anne Rice, herself, said he was the perfect Lestat and called Townsend's... Whatever that was as being too cold and humourless and not her Lestat but these teeny boppers (Oh, dear, I'm labelling) can't accept that and latch on to what they consider to be a pretty face. Townsend wasn't playing Lestat. He was playing Dracula in a leather coat but I could rant for hours about that.\n\nWhen Tom Cruise played Lestat in Interview with The Vampire there was layers to the personality. The pleading look as he asks 'Do we forgive each other then?' The way he worried for Louis as Louis ran out into the rain, the way he saved Louis from the fire, the angst the personality it was all there.\n\nWIth Stuart Townsend you had nothing. The acting was wooden. Shallow. And even if you had never read the Anne Rice novels this movie doesn't stand up on it's own. It makes little sense. And the 'hero' kills innocent girls at random because according to the director's commentary good and evil are too abstract to feed on evil doers as he did in the novels. What's so abstract about killing murderers who feel no remorse? Good and evil were major themes in the book but anyway... Aside from the book this 'hero' had to be told twice that Akasha had killed her old king from two completely different characters. And each time he was surprised. Talk about a short attention span. This movie was designed to appeal to people with a very low IQ and little respect for the original source material, be it Interview with the vampire the movie or the novels. And as a stand alone film I don't think I'd even tolerate it on Mystery science theatre.\n\nI did like the songs Forsaken and Not meant for me so I'll give it credit for that but ONLY that. Fortunately for us people who actually have a mind of our own and care about character personalities we have the Sir Elton John's The Vampire Lestat Broadway musical to look forward to."

Instead of fearing him, you feel sorry for him -- NOT the way the Vampire LeStat should be portrayed. I hate to say it, but Tom Cruise actually nailed the persona much better.\n\nVincent Perez as Marius was also miscast. He looks nothing, sounds nothing like the Marius of the books, who is a tall, blond philosopher.\n\nIt's such a shame that Aaliyah will be remembered only for this role. Someone older would've been much better than this child. She just didn't pull off the sophistication that should've been required for the part. She was very pretty, but had no depth."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Queen of the Damned\" has gotten a lot of damnation from critics, but I stand up to disagree. It simply took a completely different twist than its predecessor \"Interview with the Vampire,\" and is thought much less of as a result. I believe that they are too different to compare. I find it quite valuable to have Tom Cruise's take on Lestat, then Stuart Townsend's. They are very different, and they shine where the other's lack, and vice versa. Stuart Townsend is better at the modernized Lestat and Tom Cruise is slightly more archaic. As for Aaliyah, she made quite a presence for herself. She succeeded at being a real bad-ass with sex appeal. Who wouldn't want her to suck his/her blood? It was indeed a shame that this was her last movie, for she was convincing of her evil role despite her \"perfect popstar\" image.\n\nPeople in my opinion were afraid to appreciate a pop culture vampire story. Think about it, modern pop culture and a classic myth like vampires? I guess some mixes don't stand much of a chance in society these days..."

I also doubt Anne Rice was impressed with this portrayal.\n\nThe 90's was a high point for cinema, so much so that no one has original ideas anymore, they just remake/reboot/reimagine (plageurise) greatness, look no further than Point Break. But the 90's and early noughties also had its share of stinkers as well.\n\nPurple Monkey Dishwasher."

You can just see the filmmakers giggling as they went through the dailies and shaking their heads \"Man, we are going to p*** of *so* many Anne Rice fans.\"\n\nTo be fair, Stuart Townsend was *excellent*. Bloody brilliant. He was younger and prettier and more charismatic than Tom Cruise ever could have been in his part as Lestat (though Cruise's rendition was also uniquely commendable). The costumes were superb (the same designer from 'Moulin Rouge' pulled this delightful set of vampire garb) and I would go back just to sketch the clothes. Aaliyah was wonderfully camp, playing her motions as if in pantomime and echoing a Dracula-esque tone.\n\nJesse was miscast, but who cares! This movie produced more pure laughs than Hollywood's most recent comedies.\n\nAll of this doesn't make a good movie, however, just an entertaining one. Laugh at the deadpan one-liners and oogle the yummy silk and velvets. It's a fun little ride."

I had doubts about this movie going in, I knew it finished after Aaliyah died, but that the studio had so little faith in the film that for a while it was set to go straight to video. I can do the math, straight to video = bad. Straight to video when the star just died, a situation that increases the \"buzz\" by a factor of 10 and normally meaning big bucks, means it must stink so bad that it hurts careers of people who only THOUGHT about appearing in the movie. I gave a 2, because most of the supporting cast seemed to be trying to make the movie work."

Now I know that it is just a movie but to take the books Vampire Lestat, and The Queen of the Damned, and come out with a movie this choped up, is just wrong. I think any true Anne Rice fan would hate this movie because of how chopped it is, but if your looking for a fun will directed Vampire movie then is the Queen of the Damned. And if you have not read the books see the movie first so you are not so mad at the end of it. The one thing that I really like was Jonathan Davis' Lyrics and background vocals for Lestats sing. This movie had it ups and down like all movies do but I would have to say that it was entertaining to watch because you did see Lestat come to life, Stuart Townsend was great for the part, except for his black hair, Lestat has long blonde hair, but he was good for Lestat de Lioncourt."

There were very few moments when Townsend could connect with the Lestat character and even less for the other characters/actors. If I were Cruise, I'd have turned down the offer too. There was so much more life to the performances in \"Interview\".

At first it started out kinda weird....Lestat being a rock star just isn't right...and the whole creepy cult chic in love with Lestat really p***ed me off, but I'll get to that later. The place where this movie starts to transform is the most hauntingly beautiful scene I've ever seen. Aaliyah walks into a bar decked out in her ancient egyptian best. I don't want to give anything away, but lets just say a lot of bloodsuckers fry. The reason this movie, especially this scene is so beautiful is that it makes you feel like Aaliyah is alive. That is also why this scene is so haunting. You know she's dead. And she's just incredibly beautiful. But then again that stupid cult chic (Jesse just incase u don't know who I'm talking about) gets in the way and ruins Akasha's plans to rule with Lestat at her side. Akasha's final scene painfully reminds everyone of Aaliyah's tragic death, but it is almost like a tribute the way she died so beautifully tragic. So if you like vampires, Aaliyah, kick ass music, beautiful things, or just great movies go see this flik.....It's ten dollars I'm glad I spent."

The acting was terrible. Stuart Townsend had to be the worst possible choice for Lestat. I spent the whole movie hoping he, and all the other characters would just die. The best part of the movie was in the preview when I saw Harlan Williams doing his Wookie impression. Townsend ruined what Tom Cruise portrayed in Interview. The songs in the movie were decent, although from what I have been told are nothing like what they were supposed to be in the book(which I have not read). Apparently this was a complete mockery of the book. But let's forget about the book and look at it by itself, and it is a horrible, uneventful ride. I would say just go and buy a Korn album and forget about the movie, you will have the music and saved yourself the pain of sitting thru this crap."

        "review_detailed_main": "After seeing this movie I was left with an unusual taste. This was the taste of satisfaction. It is unusual because I haven't seen many vampire movies that could produce like Queen did. Not having the big named stars of its predecessor, (i.e. Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas) Queen still managed to be a very entertaining and interesting film for ANY movie-goer yet alone just a vampire fan, Anne Rice fan or not.\n\nThe film takes points in the books The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned and forms them to make one helluva movie! This was questioned by many fans of the Anne Rice novels and was answered by the explanation of the Producers are making one movie and did quite frankly one of the best damn jobs possible. The sexy bravado of both Aaliyah and Stuart Townsend mix as they form a great on-screen vampire duo. Fans of Interview With the Vampire won't be left missing the same actors as the new cast adds a better feel for the ethnic backgrounds of all the vampires. Also, the character of Lestat must be thought about for a second or two. In Interview, Lestat was shown as he was in the eyes of Louis. In Queen, Lestat is how he is in his own point of view, these are two different images with some likenesses but many major differences.\n\nQueen of the Damned showcases great acting, a great sense of atmosphere, a kick-ass soundtrack, and an all around vampire feel. I enjoyed the movie as will you!"

The music was a joke, but what would you expect from a film that Korn's lead singer put the music together for?

So that makes the movie not credible at all.\n\nPerhaps they should have choose a rock star to play that role. Personally, I think that Ville Valo would have absolutely nailed it if he just dyed his hair blonde (although I'm not sure if he can actually act, but he would have fitted the part more than Tom Cruise or Stuart Townsend, or just any actor at all).\n\nAnd then, of course, following the real story on the books, working on the dialogs, letting the author get involved in the screenplay and focusing on the facts that go along on the movie more than just use them as an excuse to make some sort of erotic goth love story would have helped a lot.\n\nI give it 5 out of 10 just because, watching the movie without considering the fact that it's based on the books, it is somehow entertaining."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've just finished watching this on DVD. And.......\n\nAs a 21st Century vampire movie, Queen of The Damned, isn't bad. Despite its plot flaws, it's visually appealing and has an awesome soundtrack. (Not really my preferred type of music, but I do appreciate some of it. And the music was very fitting for the film and Lestat character.) Chock full of special effects, the roles were well cast (for Gen. Y'ers to whom the movie appears to be directed) and performed.....for a vampire flick.\n\nJust not an Anne Rice Vampire flick.\n\nGranted it's been a few years since I've read Rice's Queen of the Damned (a book I adored btw), but this movie bore no resemblence to the novel whatsoever. Why on earth it bears the novel's title, I have no clue. Aaliyah's Akasha appears in only...maybe...15 mins of the entire film. The rest is a rather disjointed mess (relative to the novel) and runs like an overly long music video. (Why is Pandora---a former Roman noblewoman---walking around in an Indian Sari?!??!!?)\n\nThe DVD's special features section has about 10 deleted scenes, which in my opinion, the producers should have left in the movie. That way, the movie would have made a heck of a lot more sense and we would know who the hell is who. Other than Lestat, no one else is recognizable. And Lestat only because his name is repeated over and over and over and over again.\n\nThough Stuart Townsend makes an appealing and sexy disaffected and rebellious vampire turned rock star, Lestat he is not. His portrayal (more a flaw of the writers than his acting, I think) shows none of the maturity, cunning, nor charm Lestat should have had after a few hundred years of existence. This is particularly true given the Lestat character Tom Cruise played in \"Interview with A Vampire\" and given that the events of that movie took place long before those of this one. (Please note that Cruise wouldn't have been my choice for Lestat either, but in the end the character he turned out was well done.)\n\nI found Akasha's shimmying around annoying. If its purpose was the emphasize the Queen's etherealness, it failed. She comes off looking more like a second-rate backup dancer/groupie than Queen of all that is unholy. Again, this is not the fault of the actress, but one of the writers and director. However, I did get the impression that Aaliyah's portrayal would have been much better had they given her more to do than shimmy around.\n\nVincent Perez's Marius was one of the more all-around appealing characters, if inconsistant. Of indeterminate sexuality, the character of Marius displays at times his loneliness and disenchantment, yet a certain mischievousness (sp?), as he should be. The inconsistency comes in the fact that he's never really one or the other in the same scene. His personality seems to shift for no reason. Yet another fault of the writers.\n\nThe Jesse character was well-played by the actress (sorry, I forget her name). And the \"love story\" between her and Lestat was fitting for **this** version of ***a*** vampire movie. Tho, she kind of made me feel, \"will someone please slap her.\" But since, I can't remember the character from the book at all, I don't know if that was intentional or not.\n\nAs for the other characters, there wasn't enough of them on screen to really offer an opinion.\n\nIn sum, if you want to see a visually appealing vampire movie for the new millenium, rent Queen of the Damned. If you're expecting any resemblance to Anne Rice's books and their characters stay far, far away."

        "review_detailed_main": "Queen of the Damned has been a complicated film to me ever since I saw it at age 16 when it was first released in 2002.\n\nOn the one hand it's a very sad Swan Song for Aaliyah whose role as Akasha doesn't do her any favors, and who should have never taken it to begin with. She was dazzling as Trish O'Day playing opposite Jet Li in Romeo Must Die. And she should have just left it at that.\n\nOn the other hand, we have the vastly superior performance of Stuart Townsend over Tom Cruise as Lestat (Tom Cruise is an incredible actor but Lestat just doesn't suit him at all), as well as a relationship no one cares to comment on...\n\nA relationship which effectively ends any future he might have with the titular character before it's even had a chance to start.\n\nIt's all there, in the synopsis, for anyone to read:\n\nLestat, a vampire, reinvents himself as a rockstar, awakens Akasha the Queen of the Damned, and catches the eye of a beautiful young London woman named Jesse (Marguerite Moreau) who falls passionately in love with him.\n\nYet the critics, for some reason, have decided to ignore this one little detail: Roger Ebert skips the relationship all together, focusing instead on there possibly being more to his association with Marius (Vincent Perez). Still another reviewer from the San Francisco Chronicle chops it up to Lestat's \"seduction of a librarian\" as if Jesse Reeves were an extra he had a fling with in passing, instead of a driving force to be reckoned with throughout the story...\n\nA story which is extremely low on suspense once we see where it's all going. That Jesse Reeves is responsible for cancelling out a lot of that suspense is something that seems to have been lost on people.\n\nThat's probably because they choose to see her as just another groupie, instead of a character who eclipses any enchantment Akasha might have in the eyes of Lestat...albeit on a subliminal level.\n\nMarguerite Moreau is good here. She has a poise and solemnity which make it believable that her obsession with him (which will take over her entire life) is rooted in something deeper than contemptible rockstar erotomania. The fact that he reciprocates--that there's an actual attraction between them--gives the plot it's edge while, at the same time, spoiling Akasha's entrance.\n\nIt's the only part of the story that's interesting, and it's a part of the story people callously chose to ignore.\n\nIt makes you wonder if anybody was actually watching the movie."

This film has brilliant camera shots, the overhead tracking shot of lestats concert, is possibly the best camera shot in the whole film. The stunning visual effects are amazing, and just in general the Mise-en-scene is brilliant.\n\nall in all a wounderful film that wants you wanting more."

And don't expect it to be close to Interview With The Vampire. Why did I like this movie so much? As the girl in Lestat's band stated, \"Sex, blood, and rock n roll\" I thought Stuart Townsend did a pheonomonal job of playing the modern/rocker/playful Lestat. I thought the music was excellent and if you actually read the lyrics that make A LOT of sense, seeing as Lestat was supposed to be the one who wrote them. Aaliyah fans who are going to see this movie simply because she is in it...a word of caution she is only in it for about 26 minutes, but...it's a very good 26 minutes. With the little screen time she had she carried the role of Akasha very nicely. The movie does express some \"corny\" lines, but they make you laugh...and the communication between Lestat and Marius is also rather entertaining. This movie has a lot...action, gore, a twisted love story, rock n roll, amusement...it's something you can really sink your teeth into."

I emphasize this because the movie was as far from the novel as night is from day. The entirety of the events in the movie Queen of the Damned took place in the novel The Vampire Lestat. And there are elements from other Anne Rice books (The Talamasca) thrown in for spice. But, this movie perfectly blends the music, setting, acting and directing in order to show the vampire world as it should be experienced. Fun, exciting, thrilling, and totally engrossing, this is an incredible movie that I've gone to see again and again. Just don't expect to get what you already know as Queen of the Damned."

The soundtrack is wicked! For someone not interested in vampire movies or rock you probably wont enjoy it too much and why should you... However if your into both i highly recommend watching it!

It wasn't until watching the deleted scenes that I realized Pandora and Armand were even in the movie! I also love the music. Jonathan Davis and Richard Gibbs did a great job and I think they were really able to make Lestat fit in with the sounds of today.

I thought it was divine fate it coming out on my birthday so my friend and I went to the first show.\n\nI was definitely NOT disappointed and I don't think anyone else into vampire movies will be either. I absolutely think this movie did complete justice to the sentiment of the author and her characters.\n\nFirst of all: The sets of the movie were beautifully done. The backdrops, the props, all of it. Special effects were awesome!!!!\n\nAnother great thing about the movie were the original songs that Lestat sings. This was something that could've potentially been a disaster for the films makers had they not been both believable and very very good. They were more than believable and more than good.. I foresee the soundtrack being a big seller with me at the front of the line.\n\nThe vampires were beautiful and terrifying as was my impression when I read the book. I thought the depth and scope of the \"companion\"s relationships were underplayed but was very happy it was note entirely overlooked Ie, Marius and Lestat, Marius and Dave\n\nUpon leaving the theater the only semi fault I could find when speculating on how this fabulous film could have possibly been any better was the relationship between Lestat and Jessie was not explored enough to jive with the ending. I felt like there was a little skip in the record there. Why would Lestat care so much? etc...\n\nThe movie surely could've done with another hour to develop the intensity and length of all of the relationships: between Lestat and Marius, Jessie and Lestat, Marius and Dave, Marius and Akasha, and Lestat and Akasha, and so on.\n\nAs a Lestat fan I certainly would sit through any length film with Lestat... But for the time given to the films makers it was really well done.\n\nI loved this film and would see it again and recommend it to everyone who likes vampire movies. My friend who went with me who has never read an Anne Rice book, but who is very into vampire movies like Blade, loved it."

It's a movie, not a book, and certain artistic interpretations have to be gained and lost by the transition from book to movie. Also, notice how it says \"based\" on the novel. It doesn't say, \"exact replica of the novel\". So as it stands alone as a movie, it's entertaining(granted, that doesn't mean it's good necessarily, but if it's entertaining, it can't be all bad). Plus, it has vampires, and biting, and blood, and good music, and more vampires, and more blood, and more biting, and hot girls, and more vampires*gush*. And for those of you who wish it was a sequel to Interview, it's not. It's not meant to be. They are two completely different types of movies. I read a local review saying that QotD is just a very long music video, what's wrong with that? It's just a different way to make a movie. Sorry it isn't Schindler's List. So for those of you in want of an entertaining movie, with a great soundtrack, featuring Static-X, Deftones, David Draimon, etc., that has lots of vampires, biting, blood, and hot girls, Queen of the Damned is very cool."

There was something about the seductive way he moved and spoke that literally sucked me into the movie. But it was Queen Akasha that stole the show! This role allowed Aaliyah to shine, even though she didn't get as much screen time as she deserved and that the film focused more on Lastat than the \"QUEEN OF THE DAMNED\". But besides all that, she did an amazing job of bringing Queen Akasha to life. Aaliyah looks absolutely beautiful in this film, her natural beauty really stands out throughout the whole film. The music in the film is really awesome as well, but as I said before, the is movie rocks harder than the soundtrack! I give this movie a a HUGE thumbs up! I would also like to add that Aaliyah is greatly missed by all of her fans and she will be remembered not only for her beautiful voice, but also for the wonderful job in this film. RIP Aaliyah!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie, although not faithful to the original novels, succeeds in creating modern gothic vampire vision. Somebody tried to insult QotD calling it a 1,5h music video clip. Actually it is a complement. The everpresent gothic music combined with the music-video-like shots made the movie so moody - and \"Queen of the Damned\" is a mood-driven story.\n\nI do not understand the die hard fans who complain on the modifications of the story. The plot has been modified to be less confusing for viewers who do not know the novels. The number of characters had been lessened and I have no problems with changing Lestat's maker or skipping Mekare's character. The biggest change - the romance of Lestat and Jesse - seemed a very nice addition to me.\n\nActually, I think that a faithful adaptation would be a complete failure. The slow and gloomy mood, that was perfect to XIXth century New Orlean and Louis's angst, wouldn't fit Lestat's rebellion and his music. And while the book can be slow, descriptive and combining multiple elements yet conveying them well, the movie simply cannot do it without turning chaotic. \"Vampire Lestat\" and \"Queen of the Damned\" can be split into at least three movies - the creators had to choose something.\n\nSome of the special effects, like the flying or walking out of the flames were the only thing I actually didn't like in this movie. But Akasha's death was very nice. The cast was good, Stuard Townsend was convincing as Lestat, especially on the concert, but I preferred Banderas as Armand. I loved Jesse, Maharet and Marius though. And of course Aaliyah was perfect with her quasi-ancient-Egyptian accent.\n\nSo if you are into gothic music and vampiric dillemas of loneliness and eternity (and you don't consider books to be movie scenarios) \"Queen of the Damned\" is one of the few movies which show vampires as something more than blood sucking monsters. But please do not compare it to the \"Interview\" movie. It has a completely different style, precisely as much different as different were Louis and Lestat. Personally I find it thrilling first to watch a vampire's existence from Louis' \"bottled hunger\" point of view, and then switching to one devoid of all morals but surprisingly outgoing for a vampire, Lestat.\n\nI'd give \"Queen\" 8 of 10 as it had some technical flaws, but I decided to give it 9 as it's vastly underrated by people who hate it simply because it didn't match their vision of the books, which can be clearly seen by looking at the votes breakdown."

Personally I thought the special effects suited the film. The make-up and costume of the various vampires in the movie were outstanding and really makes you believe that there could be vampires out there. Once again, the music is amazing, Jonathan Davis is a genius! Stuart performed so well in the concert scenes making it very realistic and I could almost feel like I was there watching. All the supporting actors did a wonderful job and I think Marguerite Moreau is a great Jesse. Aaliyah makes for an intriguing and beautiful Akasha, as well as Marius & Maharet being played exceptionally. I could just think about Lestat all day......"

I loved the movie, the music was great and the cast was excellent! (Props to Vincet Perez as well for playing Marius and of course....to the late, great Aaliyah for her portrayal of the Queen.) My only complaint of the movie was that it should have been titled something other than 'Queen of the Damned' due to the fact that she was not in it for a considerable amount of time."

A little scary with just a touch of humor, this movie proved to me that the good guys do not always have to win. Conversely, the bad guys do not always have to win either. This blood sucking spin on reality (Whatever that is?) seems to blur the concept of good versus evil by pitting 'popular' evil against a more 'meat eating' version of evil. Or in todays parlance we have the non-vegetarian evil up against the pork eatin' type evil. Okay, so in summary we have Anne Rice depicting a rather bad group of the living-dead as having some type of a soul or conscience or who knows what. So I give it a 9 out of 10. And, I thought it a better movie than INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE which I gave a 7."

A blonde Armand (I had to read the credits to see who that vampire was). Pandora and Mael bursting into flame, are you serious? The movie was so far from the book that they should have named it something else like. \"Vampire Woman Arises for all of 10 minutes\".\n\nI tried to watch it as a stand alone movie but Stuart Townsend was the most unconvincing vampire I have seen on screen, he didn't look like the uncaring, emotionally void Lestat at all he looked like he couldn't wait for his scenes to be over and his voice for the character was worse than his acting.\n\nOMG, they turned it into a LOVE story. How pathetic trying to appeal to a teenage romance audience. The biggest farce after watching this on a borrowed friends DVD was listening to the comments of the directors/cast/whoever, trying to justify why there were so many changes (I borrowed it to specifically to listen what the director had to say for himself).\n\nThere just wasn't enough time to show this or that, was the biggest excuse. They dumped the TWINS!!! Why bother to do it at all if the story is completely different?\n\nI know I won't be wasting anytime going to see another Michael Rymer movie after this debacle."

I gave this a ten just because it was made and because It felt wonderful to see Lestat on screen again, not because this movie is one of the best I have seen. And I think it deserves a lot more credit than people have given it, true, the accents are annoying but, whatever... it's still cool, plus the music rather kicks ass.

In the book is explained how vampires arise and some characters are too superficial. But I can understand why the director has not explained all this, then he had to make a movie of 2,5 or maybe 3 hours. What I really found great, is that the character of Lestat was really deepened. He's a kind of devil and enjoys taking lives but at the same time he is very sensitive (the scene with the girl at the fire). He loves being a vampire but he also admires us for our mortality and our weaknesses. For me this movie is a big succes."

I think it stressed Lestat much more that Akasha, but I believe that is due to the untimely death of Aaliyah, which occurred before filming ended. Had she lived, this would have been a truly spectacular movie. Nevertheless, the effects and acting are impressive, and the actors seems well suited to their roles. Stuart Townsend makes a much better Lestat than Tom Cruise."

Umm...;-( ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; I think Stuart Townsend was perfectly fit the role of the vampire Lestat. Stuart was so sexy and gloomy....T^T Every scene of the 'Queen of the damned' was so wonderful. So fierce,gloomy,beautiful and sexy. I am totally fall in love with this movie. So I bought the set(include 4 book)of vampire chronicles in the Amazon. Even I am a Korean,and my poor English. 5days ago, The books was arrived. And now, I am reading 'the Vampire lestat'. Sooooo wonderful and awesome. Anyway, I recommend this awesome movie \"The vampire lestat\"."

It's also turned me into a Marguerite Moreau fan, because she was excellent in it as well.\n\nIt has been criticised by saying it doesn't stay true to the book - but I challenge anyone to try and fit the entire length of the book into one movie, without needing to miss parts of it out.\n\nThe only thing I didn't like and that I wished I was warned about was the bit with Akasha first in the club - I'm not giving anything away, but it made me feel pretty ill.\n\nA perfect movie to watch with friends late at night."

While in the course of time, another has arisen, Akasha (Aaliyah, 1979 - 2001), the Queen of the Vampires, the Queen of the Dammed.\n\nThe action here is on par with the great cinematography of landscapes and of both classic and modern buildings, mixed together with the right colours and shade have given a feeling of classic menace meets new age horror. With its hard rock soundtrack have produced a vampire movie that is both individual and surprisingly well made. The sets are truly magnificent along with the work of Ian Baker, having worked on The Devil's Playground (1976), Plenty (1985), The Punisher (1989) and Six Degrees of Separation (1993). Visually stunning and with great edits from Dany Cooper that quicken both pace and blight even the darkest of any vampires sleepy wake.\n\nWith a minor but important role from British actor Paul McGann, there is a cast here, and background staff, that holds this together with charisma and professionalism. The Queen of the Damned is worthy of reprisal, dig your teeth in and take a bite, this will fill your appetite."

I also adored it's prequel \"Interview with a Vampire.\" This was probably more of a success then Queen of the Damned but still... I like it lol?! Some of the SFX weren't very impressive and their is the occasional cheesy line eg. \"Come out come out wherever you are,\" yet I suppose the lifestyle of a vampire turned superstar still amazes me. I haven't read the books yet but when I do I'm sure they'll be even better. I supposed it's one of those films that do not appeal to many people, I guess I might be one of the only fan that likes it? I think the main characteristics of this film is probably 1. It's vampirish/ Gothic music 2. Stuart Townsend and his incredibly sexy voice and body, his acting also impressed me in league of extraordinary gentlemen, another film worth watching! And 3. Aaliyah who sadly died after the making of this film RIP Aaliyah I loved your music too. XxXxX"

I saw this movie before Interview with the Vampire and before i even knew the books existed, so i was shocked to find how many people actually hated the movie. I picked up quickly that the book fans weren't at all happy with the unfaithfulness, not wanting to be hypocritical (I hate the Harry Potter movies due to lack of book loyalty)i stayed silent. Eventually i picked up \"The Vampire Lestat\" and understood immediately why everyone hated it. It is completely different (The movie Queen of the damned is a combination of \"The Vampire Lestat\" and \"The Queen of the Damned\"). But i still loved the movie from when i saw it before reading any of the books. So if you haven't seen this movie or read the book watch the movie first or you'll hate it. If you have read the book then you have every right to hate this movie."

        "review_title": "Thoroughly enjoyable - really!",
        "review_detailed_main": "All right - let's go through the issues. The first movie, Interview With The Vampire, wasn't bad. It wasn't a masterpiece, but it was slick, well-produced, highly dramatic - in parts even unsettling -, and featured what in my opinion is Tom Cruise's only truly charismatic role ever (as you can gather, I'm no fan of his). Kirsten Dunst's child vampire was very cool, possibly her best role ever (generally, I'm not a terribly big fan of her, either). All in all, an effectively entertaining movie. I rated it a 7 out of 10.\n\nNext I should mention that I'm not a fan, or reader, of Anne Rice, or of vampires generally. I just see the movies. But I hear things, and it was quite plain in the first movie that a number of rather significant liberties had been taken with the original story. The problem with that wasn't that it was done, but that it showed. While very well-produced, Interview With The Vampire was an obviously glossed-over version of the book, with many of the basic ideas and situations changed from the kind of clever ideas you see in a decently-written book and into the kind of rather less clever ideas you see in a typical mainstream Hollywood movie. The first movie, put simply, tried too hard to be mainstream.\n\nIn my judgment, the second movie - Queen of the Damned - didn't make that mistake. Sure, there are changes in the story, but the thing is, it doesn't show. If you haven't read the books, Queen of the Damned works very well as an independent entity. And what's more, it preserves the feel of the books' ideas and situations extremely well. There's so much in this movie that is obviously taken directly from the books, because it's just that kind of clever scenes. This is not just fancypants Hollywood producers taking an original story and warping it into some soulless commercial sludge. This movie, despite the changes, shows respect to the original work, retaining much of its mood and atmosphere. How can I say this without having read the books? I dunno. It just feels that way, very strongly, when I watch it. I'm certain it's the case. The whole feel of the movie came across as thoroughly literary.\n\nI had heard, of course, that this movie was going to be bad, but the fact is that, quite surprisingly, I was thoroughly entertained by Queen of the Damned. Good story, cool acting, fun vampire action. It captivated me all the way through, and I even liked the ending. I'm not an Aaliyah fan, and while her acting in this movie technically wasn't very good, her character was still megacool, and she made a great \"supervillain\". Maguerite Moreau also needs special mention. She is indeed stunningly attractive, and one thirsts for more material with her after having seen this.\n\nUltimately, Queen of the Damned was a good movie. Not a great masterpiece, but an honest, coherent romp of an adventure, with some great ideas and generally good performances. As with the previous movie, I rate it a 7 out of 10, but it is a bigger 7 (which I have since raised to an 8). The first movie was melodramatic and too Hollywoodized; two shortcomings that the sequel did not have, which makes it more watchable. Furthermore, Queen of the Damned managed to use the entire goth subculture, and its stylistic similarities to the vampire concepts, so well that I became engrossed in a kind of culture - and music! - that I've never had any interest in before. That's quite an achievement!!\n\nI salute the producers of Queen of the Damned.\n\nFinally, I have to mention another cool vampire movie I watched recently: The Twins Effect. It's a Hong Kong produced vampire comedy, superbly well-produced and uproariously enjoyable. Better than either of these Rice products. See it."

When I sat down the the theater, I expected the books to be portrayed on the screen and was severely disappointed. In retrospect, the movie as a whole expresses the key characteristics of Lestat, the main character. Through that character's music, his personality and essence and be truly seen. The movie removes a few of the critical characters from the book, but still manages to create the ominous overtones... I'd recommend that if you've read the book: view it once and be angry, but go back and see it at least once more with an open mind."

        "review_detailed_main": "I enjoyed \"Queen of the Damned\" far more than the other Vampire Chronicle adaptation, \"Interview With The Vampire\" (I like Jordan's work generally). I think that many people, who like the books, got swept into them: into the fun historical milieu and eroticism. Jordan's film took itself a little seriously and tried to draw that world in too much detail. This movie knows that the immediate appeals of this novel are the classics of escapism: youthful sexuality, delusions of grandeur, and big effect violence. Viewers want all of these and want them serving some simple didactic theme. In this case, even an egotistic cruel vampire, like Lestat, can have a shred of humanity and will make the choice to serve humanity's best interest (even though to him they are an amusement). The new faces in the cast were good. Aaliyah looks great, but her dialogue was a little flat, nonetheless she shows the same charismatic potential that River Phoenix and Tupac Shakur showed and her untimely death, like theirs, means that her talents will be forever represented as ripening. I liked Stuart Townsend, his Lestat was sexier and more charismatic than that \"other fellow\" who played the part years back. I liked Marguerite Moreau and Vincent Perez but felt that more of their work may have ended up on the cutting room floor. Not enough of Lena Olin! I wished that they had attended a little more to Louis and some of their backstory (a mention of Claudia and Armand might have been nice.) The presentation of the goths was interesting. I wonder how many of them will see this film and realize that most of them are more like the naieve or dorky characters who the vampires denigrate, than they are like vampires themselves. Basically, where the novels \"Interview\" and \"Lestat\" were fun pseudo-history and pseudo-biography, \"Queen\" was a little soapy and glitzy. The movie is an eye-candy version of a word-candy book ... not too nutritious but sensationally satisfying."

The story made perfect sense to me, the characters were portrayed well and interesting to watch, and the effects added to the plot, rather than acting as an excuse for the plot. Alliyah would have been proud of her performance and I think Townsend made a much better Lestat than Cruise's overly-mannered performance. A good popcorn movie, well worth the price of admission....and who cares if it varies a bit from the book....different mediums often require story variations. I even think the soundtrack helped build the mood and style of the film. See it, you'll like it!"

He flawlessly expresses Lestat's dark sensuality throughout the movie. I feel absorbed by his darkly affectionate eyes, sympathetic of his windswept infatuation for Akasha and stirred by his veiled passion for Jesse.\n\nThe ending is perfect, which is the main element of a movie that makes you want to see it again.

If you haven't read the books, the movie gives you enough history that you can follow along the storyline. If you have read the books, then you finally get to see the atmosphere and hear the voices that until now have been ghostly echoes in our heads. Stuart Townsend was perfect as Lestat. Head to toe and back again: vicious and mysterious and bold. Aaliyah brought Akasha an age-old beauty that few others could have done so well. She will be missed. I enjoyed this movie greatly! I've seen it twice and intend to go a few more times! Forget the popcorn, though, it just gets caught between your fangs..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Queen of the Damned is a 2002 vampire horror film and a loose adaptation of the third novel of Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles series, The Queen of the Damned, although the film contains many plot elements from the latter novel's predecessor, The Vampire Lestat. It stars Aaliyah as the vampire queen Akasha, and Stuart Townsend as the vampire Lestat. Queen of the Damned was released six months after Aaliyah's death and is dedicated to her memory.\n\nVampire Lestat is awakened from decades of slumber by the sound of a heavy metal band which he proceeds to take over as the lead singer. Achieving international success and planning a massive live concert, Lestat is approached by Marius, and warned that the vampires of the world will not tolerate his flamboyant public profile.\n\nJesse Reeves, a researcher for the paranormal studies group Talamasca, is intrigued by Lestat's lyrics and tells the rest of the group her theory that he really is a vampire. Her mentor, David Talbot, takes her aside and tells her they know he is and that a vampire called Marius made him. He also shows her Lestat's journal that he recovered and is now in the Talamasca library. In a flashback to his origins, Lestat recalls how he awoke Akasha, the first vampire, with his music. Jesse tracks him down to a London vampire club where he saves and confronts her. She later goes to Los Angeles for the concert and gives him back his journal. The two spend some time together and Lestat shows her both the horrors and the perks of being a vampire. Showing him that she's not scared of him Jesse stays with Lestat as she sees how lonely and miserable he is. She asks him to turn her as she reveals that it's her dream to be a vampire, but he refuses as he won't do it to her. The more time they spend together, the closer they become and soon Lestat and Jesse start to fall in love. Meanwhile Akasha is awakened by Lestat's new music. She arrives and torches the club, and all the vampires inside, who want Lestat dead.\n\nAt the concert in Death Valley, a mob of vampires attack Lestat and Marius. Akasha bursts through the stage and takes Lestat with her as her new King. The two vampires then proceed to have a sort of sexual intercourse in Akasha's home where they mutually feed on one another. During which time Lestat becomes spellbound by Akasha and is forced to obey her. Empowered by Akasha's blood, Lestat and the Queen confront the Ancient Vampires at the home of Maharet, Jesse's aunt, who is an Ancient Vampire. The Ancient Vampires were planning to kill Akasha, to save the human world from demise. Akasha then commands Lestat to kill Jesse as The Queen sees her both as an enemy and as food as she is Maharet's mortal niece and Maharet is a big enemy of Akasha's. Queen Akasha also wanted to make an example out of Jesse because Jesse dared to stand-up to her and to put fear into the other vampires. Lestat ostensibly obeys the Queen, but afterwards he quickly comes to his senses and is released from her power. He then very angrily turns and begins to drain Akasha's blood with the help of the Ancients. Mael and Pandora are killed by Akasha's power. Armand is almost killed, but is saved as The Queen's powers diminish. Maharet is the last to drink Akasha's blood, and thereby ends up becoming a marble \"statue\". Maharet then becomes the new Queen Of the Damned.\n\nLestat then turns and walks to where Jesse is lying lifeless, and cradling her in his arms, gives her his blood, turning her into a vampire. Jesse, now a vampire, and Lestat then return the journal to the Talamasca, and walk away, among mortals, into the night. As they exit it is shown that they are now a couple and hold hands while Marius enters the Talamasca. The film closes with a scene of David reading the journal as Marius's voice catches his attention, cheerfully saying, \"Hello, David.\""

There is lot of very bad movies about vampire and they have great ratings here, so I don't get how this great movie is rated so poor. I've seen this movie many many times now and still love to watch it like the first time. Lestat and Queen Akasha are totally sexy Vampires, dark and cruel. The film leaves you thinking that you could decide if you were in his place. Would you accept what it offers Queen Akasha or human Jesse Reeves? I am not fun of vampire movies and think they are for teens, but this one is for watching with your loved one at your date night :)"

In The Queen of the Damned the cast is less well-known but no less valid, Townsend offers a more human, but very interesting, unpublished Lestat, Vincent Perez with \"his\" Marius gives the best character of the film and poor Alahya (RIP) is beautiful and very good in the role of the queen.\n\nThird and last point, as a metalhead, the combination of horror and heavy metal is something that I love and everything is handled very well here, the soundtrack is magnificent, Jonathan Davis has created some wonderful songs, but the others by artists are also very good like Disturbed, Static X, Godhead etc."

But there is no reason to trash this movie just because it's not like books, it's a fascinating by itself."

I Still can't understand why so many over rate that garbage?\n\nStuart Townsend was pretty slick as the vampire Lestat, so much that he resembles Brandon Lee's look from The Crow. It's not surprising to learn as to why this movie was given a lukewarm response from the critics as to a rather weak story and thin plot. However it was also nice to see that many took notice of Aaliyah's performance as this not doubt helped provide more publicity and success received. Though I'm a fan of vampires I was annoyed that it was only granted a \"15\" rating in the U.K. as I'm sure it would've been more gorier.\n\nIt was also nice to see French actor Vincent Perez playing another dark Gothic role as Lestat's vampire maker since his role in The Crow: City of Angels (no way better than the original). And the beautiful Swedish actress Lena Olin and newcomer Marguerite Moreau for their supportive performances. One of the most beautifully crafted scenes that really deserves a thumbs up is the \"concert confrontation\" involving Stuart Townsend and Vincent Perez and a large group of angry vampires battling it out on center stage in front of a large crowd of fans. That rocks.\n\nNot a bad movie at all. I just hope the DVD comes out with extras, outtakes, deleted scenes and maybe something special for any Aaliyah fans out there? (I know I'm one)."

On scale with other movies I mean yeah it is bad, but you really not need to get mad and fired up about it, just take it for what it is; a movie made for a certain group of people. Stuart Townsend is freaking brilliant as Lestat he really seemed like a vampire unlike Mr. Cruise who just played Lesat as himself...like he does in most of his movies. Aaliyah did a pretty good job, I think she got the feel of the character, but at the same time there was something missing. Keep in mind though Aaliyah was a singer trying out acting not a professional actress. Some of the lines where a little too predictable and stupid which over all just made the movie way too corny at parts when it really didn't need to be at all.\n\nI loved the movie soundtrack, I am a big fan of Korn, Deftones, and Static-X, Jonathan Davis did a good job composing the songs they had a believable feel that this is what a vampire who was bored with immortality and didn't care anymore would write about. They probably should not of had Davis sing for Lesat though his voice is just too recognizable it made way to obvious that Townsend wasn't singing. I'm sure they could of just had Townsend sing and messed around with it in post to make him sound good, and it would of seemed believable.\n\nIf you like vampire movies like me and you like \"nu-metal\"/goth rock like me you will probably like Queen of the Damned."

Face it, Rice fans. The project had SO many things working against it, mainly because QUEEN starts in the middle of a complicated story. The clever screenwriters managed to condense Lestat's history, blend in the Queen story, and (thankfully) reduce the unnecessary complexities of Jesse's psychic links to Ancient Egypt. (Reality check: INTERVIEW didn't profit enough for Hollywood to gamble on a two-part film; this was before the RINGS trilogy and KILL BILL). But hey, this film has a pair of KILLER PERFORMANCES by Townsend and Aliyah, stylish direction, a cool score, and a fast pace that THIS Rice fan, at least found VERY satisfying. Frankly, I'm shocked how much I enjoyed it, even though I have A WARNING FOR NON-READERS OF ANNE RICE: You probably won't understand half of what's going on."

The camera positions/movements are quite professional ; I don't see the acting itself to be very bad, all of the actors have charm and they hide efficiently the understandable discomfort during some somewhat complicated performances. I find the special effects to be good for the time of the release of the movie.\n\nAt first, I expected to be watching a random supernatural movie, with goofs, etc... but I hardly found any. Music is great, color is great, camera-action is great and, of course, the story is very well told ; we don't get lost and every scene is logically linked to another at a time during the movie, which means everything has an explanation. And what not might be properly explained is what IS supposed to be left to one's imagination.\n\nI encourage every one who has , at least once in their lifetime, thought of Darkness in general, to take the time to watch this movie : you might get sucked into deeper, meaningful thoughts of yourself and whatever scares you."

The movie is not very faithful to the book, it's more like a joint a story of The Vapire Lestat and Queen of the Damned. Actually I would say it is BASED on The Vapire Lestat rather than Queen of the Damned. Watch the movie, and THEN read the book, it's really better if you do it in this order: read the book first and you will not appreciate the movie. I know I didn't. I've grown to love Anne Rice and her Vampire Chronicles and I hated the dark-hair Lestat, whose hair should have been blond and long, and I also hated the fact that the movie presented Marius as the maker of Lestat, instead of Magnus. I also can't imagine why the movie did not include Maharet's sister, Mekare, who played a huge role in the book. The movie is good, I would say even great, but don't compare it to the book too much.."

I'm a rock musician and the notion of a vampire using rock to reconnect with humans and upset his own breed resonated with me. I like this Lestat better than Tom Cruise's, and Marius almost steals the movie for me. Aliyah's scene in the vampire bar (slinky!) and the concert are visually stunning. And the cinematography takes full advantage of the many interesting faces. Not quite Eisenstein, but effective. Anyway, I liked it, and enjoy it almost as much with the sound off."

At first when I heard they were making a movie on Anne Rice's third book I prayed they don't take Tom Cruz again for the role of The Vampire Lestat and thank god they didn't and thank god again they chose Stuart Townsend. After reading 3 books in which The Vampire Lestat had featured, I had formed a definite image of him in my mind, of a bold but very sensitive immortal and Stuart Townsend's performance as The Vampire Lestat is the best performance as a vampire I have ever seen while that of Vincent Perez as Marius is severely lacking - nowhere in the movie does he manage to portray himself as an ancient Vampire and being superior to Lestat in elegance and power of character and his performance is one of the shortcomings of the film.\n\nComing to other things, after seeing the movie for the first time I felt disappointed that they changed many things from the chronicles but at the same time, I did not fail to appreciate how so many other things like the spirit of Anne Rice's tales were still there in the movie and the music they included was simply spectacular. If The Vampire Lestat were real and would make a musical album he might write the exact same one. As for things being changed I understand their reasons.. Anne Rice's chronicles of Vampires is too huge a tale and there's no way they could cram every thing in a 2 hour movie. They had to include the essence of it and still have it make sense and changing a few things here and there had to be done.\n\nAs for the special effects, it does look artificial at times and is a little too excessive, they should have relied less on it and relied more on the old disappearing from one place to another instead of showing them blurringly flying perhaps. Anne Rice did however explicitly state that her Vampires were capable of all this and it was an attempt to be as true to the book as is possible."

It was an erotic film, and Aaliyah was quite seductive.\n\n3. It was disappointing in that important scenes were cut from the movie. (Where did these people learn to edit a movie?? Why in the world they cut out the introductory scenes for the ancient vampires, in addition to a few other important scenes? Before I saw the DVD feature about the scenes cut from the movie, I had to guess who Armand, etc. was.)\n\n4. The soundtrack kicked ass.\n\nAs with any movie, it was different than the novel. For example, Lestat could not fly until he drank enough of Akasha's blood in the 20th Century. At least the movie wasn't as gay as the novel.\n\nAll in all, it was an excellent movie. If you had to decide between the DVD and VCR formats, purchase the DVD version. It has important cut scenes that you can watch after the movie, in addition to a few other features, including background information about the soundtrack. Jonathon Davis of Korn did an excellent job putting everything together."

When he awakes the storyline begins to develop when he tries to get vampires to stop hiding and to attack him. This all backfires when he alerts Aaliyah, the mother of all vampires. R.I.P Aaliyah"

        "review_detailed_main": "I went in expecting the worst. I came out really, really surprised by how much I liked it. Maybe the key was I was expecting horrible trash because the majority of reviews were soooooo critical. However, Stuart Townsend was so much better in the part of Lestat, in my opinion. This movie LOOKED fantastic. The style was great, especially the whole Kabinett des Doktor Caligari theme to the Lestat videos and stage show. It doesn't take itself too horribly serious, either, which should be apparent during the vampire battle during the Death Valley show. The only part that I thought took away from the film was the whole Talamasca bit. It just seemed to be in there to help explain so many things that couldn't more easily be crammed into an hour and forty minutes. So, it was kinda weak, but necessary for production's sake. That happens sometimes.\n\nIn all I give it an 8 out of 10. It was something I wanted to see again right after, which doesn't happen very often and for me tells me it was something good.\n\nAlso, if there wasn't so much baggage to be taken in with this movie, it would be considered much better. It kicked \"John Carpenter's Vampires\" weak ass! It was better than \"Interview...\" in total value, though the first obviously had a lot more money and production thrown at it. The story that was arranged for this movie was good, period. It may have butchered the books, but it's true to itself, and is at least, at the VERY least, as good as the \"Blade\" series that's out there."
