        "review_detailed_main": "Okay, it is quite horrible. Yet, despite the overall harsh criticisms found on here, it is nothing at all near being one of the worst movies I have ever seen - in my lifetime, this year, or even this month. Bad? Yes indeedy! But God Awful? Not quite(though perhaps closer than I am letting on to). Steve Howey plays Stan Helsing who works at a video store. Halloween night is here and Stan meets up with two incredibly hot girls and his buddy Kenan Thompson(you figure out which one is unlikely to be in that quartet in reality). Thankfully Kenan is there, because he has a few of the few laughs that are in this film(the others belonging to octogenarian and living legend Leslie Nielsen dressed as a hideous barmaid). It seems Stan is destined to live up to his ancestry and slay monsters - what monsters you may ask? Well, ridiculously and inept looking ones NOT from classic horror but from modern \"classics\"(I shudder even putting THAT in parentheses!) We get Pleatherface with a leaf blower and a line when he no longer has it, \"It looks like no one will get blown tonight.\" Stop your sides from aching now with laughter. We get Chucky looking like a guy with painted x's and o's on his face. A Pinhead double from Hellraiser. Anf let's no forget the Michael Myers, Jason, and Fweddy doubles as well. All of these look so stupid and like someone from a fifth grade art class got to work on their wardrobe and costumes. There are other horror references and a story that defies logic - and explanation here for lack of need. Really, Stan Helsing is like Epic Movie, Disaster Movie, and Date Movie. It has a few laughs but not enough to even keep this lame crap afloat long at all. The humor is mostly adolescent and sophomoric with at least four references to bathrooms and all that great humor that comes from noises and the other fertile comedic ground that is inherent in feces and urine. Does the movie have any saving graces? Well, Kenan Thompson and good ole Leslie Nielsen are good some of the time. There are a few jokes that land roughly but in place. Then there are the female cast members who for the most part are very, very pleasant to look at like the three gals playing vampire strippers and Diora Baird and Desi Lydic as the two female leads. Neither can really act though Lydic has comedic potential. Baird has some fine assets to keep abreast of nonetheless. If you are looking for clever or witty humor, you must look elsewhere. If you have an IQ near that of a quasi-literate teen - you might think it is totally rad or some such feeling. Phewwww!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Stan Helsing, a video clerk for a certain video chain store, is ready for a Halloween party with three of his closest friends. But before the party, he has been asked to deliver a bag full of movies to the store's manager, who lives in a gated community. What lies beyond the gate: karaoke, monsters and gay porn studios. This is going to be a long night.\n\nLet me be blunt, when you tell me a film is coming from the same people, or the same sort of people who brought us \"Scary Movie\", \"Date Movie\", \"Disaster Movie\" and so on... I'm inclined to believe this is one more film that was a waste of time for the actors, a waste of money to make, and a waste of brain cells for anyone who watches it. Mysteriously, despite this bias, I enjoyed \"Stan Helsing\".\n\nSure, the humor is juvenile, revolving almost entirely around hookers, strippers, porn and the same gratuitous sex that we've come to expect since at least \"American Pie\" (you can say such humor dates back at least to \"Porky's\", but don't tell me that the new wave of it has any wit behind the smut). Somehow, with my mind turned off and my stomach full of Corby's brand whiskey, I found this film humorous and enjoyable from the first five minutes.\n\nIt has some disappointments. The monsters are such a minor part of the plot, sadly, and even Leslie Neilson has a role that isn't as funny as it should be. But such simple jokes as the porn title spoofs got me laughing (\"Glad He Ate Her\"? Classic) and I don't mind a few gorgeous women on my screen from time to time.\n\nBut as I say, if you're looking for a clever monster spoof, it's not here. The monsters sing a karaoke song, but their origins are not explained and they have maybe ten to fifteen minutes of screen time, contrary to what it would appear by the cover. But if you like dumb humor, like \"Dude, Where's My Car?\", this would be worth your time... especially with a friend and a bottle of Feckin Irish whiskey."

There were a few parts where I laughed- near the beginning, but after that it seems as though the film budget ran out of money or something because after the halfway point it completely looses direction. I kept expecting a story to develop or some kind of back history on 'Van Helsing' to appear. It didn't. The characters are poorly written...and even with the comedic assistance of Leslie Neilson it still flops hardcore.\n\nLeslie Neilson must be really hard up for acting spots to have taken a spot in this stinker. My recommendation is that you don't watch this one....in fact don't even rent it. Its really that bad."

I can't blame the cast since they obviously try their best to make this work. But you can see the desperation in the main character's eyes when he has to do another pointless dialog. Shutting your mind of isn't an option either since there is no slapstick comedy to be enjoyed. Well there are some redeeming elements or maybe even the only reason to watch this. The two girls. One with very nice boobs (Diora Baird) and the other one extremely hot blonde (Desi Lydic). Sadly this just isn't enough to be tortured through the whole movie.

And they do try to make the a bit like the people they are base off of. Like when they use their weakness is like what fans made fun of the real people they copied. To defeat Freddy get rid of his glove. Pinhead push the nails in. The mask think with Jason and Myers is not their weakness but it showed how similar they are and that Jason was a ripoff of Myers. Leatherface wait till his chainsaw runs out of gas. And Chucky he is a doll. If you missed that then you have no business making fun of this movie. And the other main characters I thought was a good casting choice and they were really funny. Finally they didn't a a truck load of over the top reality breaking jokes.

        "review_detailed_main": "There are some comedies that just try too hard, and Stan Helsing falls into this category. Written and directed by Bo Zenga who has more producing credits and making his directorial debut, Stan Helsing stars a cast of relative unknowns hobbled together to forcefully create laugh-a-minute sequences that don't always hit their marks, but instead fall quite short in not being silly for silliness sake.\n\nOne thing's for sure though, is that Zenga dug deep to throw plenty of movie references from the horror genre into his comedy, especially when the villains turn out to be cheap knockoffs of their real cult counterparts, with Fweddy (Freddy from A Nightmare from Elm Street), Mason (Jason from Friday the 13th), Needlehead (Pinhead from Hellraiser), Pleatherface (Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre), Lucky (Chucky from Child's Play) and Michael Crier (Michael Myers from Halloween), and not including minor ones such as the Hitcher, and a giant cockroach. But ultimately there's nothing here to make this film anywhere near being horrific, except that the end product is quite horrific in itself.\n\nOn the other corner of the ring of good, we follow the adventures of a foursome consisting of the slacker Schlockbuster video clerk Stan Helsing (Steve Howey) whom everyone mistakes from Van Helsing the monster exterminator, who has been tasked to drop off some videos en route to his Halloween party with hottie ex-girlfriend Nadine (Diora Baird), his best friend Teddy (Kenan Thompson) and an exotic dancer cum massage therapist (interpret this as you will!) Mia (Desi Lydic), on a road trip filled with last minute detours leading from point to point and incident filled. The entire journey unravels with inexplicable coincidences relying on clich\u00e9 after clich\u00e9 to bring on some cheap laughs, which when proved inadequate there's always the odd toilet joke to stink bomb everything.\n\nDialogue is full of sexual double meanings, with Mia being the group idiot to fall for, or become the butt of the jokes. Nothing in the narrative ever makes much good sense other than to react or create a hilarious situation for our foursome to get into, and filmmakers perhaps need to stop and take stock of the comedy genre now that spoofing pop culture, or pop icons, are no longer a quick and easy way to surprise and satisfy an audience, and not when the impersonations was far from their mark.\n\nDon't get me wrong that I've lost my funny bone, but this relatively cheap production didn't have much to laugh at. What's more painful is that it starred the late Leslie Nielsen in drag and makeup as a bar waitress, and seemed more like a desperate role meant for paying the bills. Filled with jokes with some being naughty while others nonsensical and silly, probably the scenes set within the video store bookending the film with patrons providing sight gags and trash talking became the main highlights."

        "review_detailed_main": "Stan Helsing: A Parody (R, 1:30) \u2014 Other: Comedy, bargain basement, formula\n\n2 background facts:\n\n(1) In Bram Stoker's classic novel Dracula, the intrepid Dutch adventurer who was the vampire count's nemesis was Abraham Van Helsing. (\"Bram\", incidentally, is a diminutive of \"Abraham\".)\n\n(2) By vote of knowledgeable fans at the 2003 World Science Fiction Convention, the 3rd best SF film of the 20th Century was Forbidden Planet. It was released in 1956. It starred Leslie Nielsen as the heroic spaceship captain.\n\nI have listed this film as a comedy, since that's what it purports to be. Certainly it's full of formulaic horror-movie stereotypes, which you would expect from a self-proclaimed parody. And I laffed out loud a couple of times, which means it can't sink to the absolute rock bottom of my ratingometer. That's about it for the singing of praises, tho.\n\nThe protagonist is the slacker video clerk Stan Helsing (family name simply Helsing, not Van Helsing), who keeps getting mistaken for his ancestor by people who are particularly well informed on this issue while otherwise showing a remarkable tendency to drown while gazing upward open-mouthed during a rainstorm.\n\nStan (Steve Howey) and 3 friends set out for a Halloween party. One of the group, Nadine (Diora Baird) is Stan's ex-girlfriend, she's pretty emphatic about the \"ex\" part, and we see in flashback why she feels that way, as Stan is one of the most insensitive lunkheads on the planet. This raises the question \"Why the hell is Nadine going to a party with this schmuck?\"\n\nNo attempt is made to answer that or explain the many other improbabilities. The viewer is left to infer that the various horror-movie creatures wandering around wreaking havoc are going unnoticed because everyone else thinks they're just costumed for Halloween.\n\nPoor Nielsen plays Kay, an overworked waitress, in lipstick and drag. This was just painful to watch.\n\nAmong many random occurrences thrown into the plot in no particular order are gratuitous panty and boob shots; a monsters vs. heroes karaoke contest; Freddie, Jason, and a little kid in a hockey mask who gets seriously whacked in a case of mistaken identity; and a hard-to- miss giant cockroach that the lesbians in the next toilet stall nonetheless managed to miss.\n\nSomebody evidently thot this would be funny. By \"somebody\" I don't mean me."

But that's what makes it fun.\n\nIt has been years since I've seen this but I still remember how much my husband and I laughed while watching this. He hates horror so these kinds of movies is the closest thing I can get him to watch. I think people will enjoy this as long as they don't take it too seriously.

Just so everyone gets the picture, the humour in this and the overall quality is on par with the disastrous collection from Seltzer and Friedberg (Epic, date Movie etc.) There are so many problems with this film that it borders on insanity. There is virtually NO plot, structure or pacing and we never get any explanation of whats going on or why. Even all the villain spoofs (which is what the point of the movie is supposed to be) are so paper thin and mind-bogglingly-stupid. Why is Freddy supposed to be all gangsta? or why is Mike Myers Jewish? The villains get minimal screen time and their all just kind of there...for no particular reason.\n\nThe film is full of toilet humour and gross out/sex gags (as i said, Friedberg/Seltzer) and while I did chuckle once or twice, I wouldn't say it was funny.\n\nWhile watching I was hoping that there would be some wicked fight at the end to redeem it to some degree. But the ending is just as disappointingly awful as the rest of the film.\n\nThe idea of a great descendant of Van Helsing fighting off all of the big time movie monsters of contemporary film is actually a great idea and It could have worked as a zany spoof or a Jack Brooks style over the top horror-comedy, but it is so poorly executed that it defies logic. It doesn't work as a comedy. It doesn't' work as a horror. But most importantly, it doesn't work as a MOVIE. There is no film here. Only a pathetic half arsed attempt at one.\n\nDon't watch it ever, in fact try and forget it exists, it will make the world a far better place"

It's hard to describe how bad this was, but I will try: It would be more fun to watch paint dry, listen to keys stuck in a running garbage disposal for an hour or bungee jump without the bungee cord. It's equally hard to describe the plot. Again, I will try: boy-wonder, Stan, commonly mistaken for the original \"Van Helsing\" (Ha, ha, ha, that is so funny \u2013 no seriously, it was so funny, you will hear that joke 2 dozen times) and his gang are off to a Halloween party, but get detoured when Stan has to drop off videos. On this comical (sorry, I cannot lie, make that sobering) journey they meet the Garbage Pail Kid's versions of Freddy, Michael, Leatherface, Chucky and Jason. A lot of the time when I dislike a movie, I can safely say, \"well, to each their own, someone's gotta find value in this.\" For this piece of trash, I will confidently say: \"STAY AWAY. DO NOT RENT OR WATCH, EVEN FOR FREE. EXORCISE THIS ABOMINATION.\" Am I being too harsh? Well, anyone that didn't adhere to my warning, you tell me. Please also tell me how this got green-lit? It couldn't be the sad Leslie Nielsen cameo. It couldn't be the producers even though people remembered who \"Van Helsing\" was \u2013 this is like spoofing '13th Warrior' now in 2009. All of the actors looked amazed they had jobs, though they honestly shouldn't \u2013 their lines appeared to have been read seconds before the shot.

Somebody ought to tell the people in Hollywood production studios that we really don't need any more spoofs; seriously. Stan Helsing, a video store clerk and direct descendant of Van Helsing \u2013 although he's the only one in his surrounding who doesn't realize that - , and his friends are on their way to attend a Halloween party, but first they have to make a detour to the \"bad part of town\" to deliver some rental tapes. On the road, they encounter all sort of situations that look strangely familiar \u0085 like they're coming straight out of horror movie blockbuster. The premise is fairly original, but the script relies too much on unoriginal gags and clich\u00e9d situations. There are, for example, way too many blond bimbo jokes and similar derivative stereotypes. Simply put: for every decent and remotely funny joke, there are about a dozen and a half embarrassing and horrid ones. I laughed quite hysterically at the sight of our hero mistaken a grade school hockey goalie for Jason Voorhees and beating the crap out of him, for example, but then later you have to struggle through a painfully disastrous cameo appearance of Leslie Nielsen as a transvestite barman in a redneck karaoke bar. The climax is atrocious, with a horror movie monster karaoke showdown! Yeah, that really is as retarded as it sounds. It's Chucky, Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees, Pinhead, Leatherface and Freddy Krueger performing their version of the Village People's \"YMCA\". Oh well, I guess that at least it's a positive thing that the writers remained faithful to the more classic horror films and legendary villains of the 70's and 80's. To compensate partially for the overall bad quality level of the jokes, at least they hired some really pretty actresses, like Diora Baird (who walks around the entire film in a revealing Indian squaw outfit) and Desi Lydic."

And the latest addition, this ultra low budget (and looking every bit of it) monstrosity, written and directed by Bo Zenga, is a further scary nail in the coffin. The props, costumes and production values through out give the impression of being cobbled together by people who either didn't know what they were doing or just wanted a rush job and with such poor acting, writing and story telling, it's quite a boring chore to sit through too. As for any laughs, it's more notable for it's surrealness, such as seeing Leslie Nielsen in a waitress outfit and even more so Freddy Kruegger, Pinhead, Chucky, Leatherface, Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees doing their distinctive karaoke take on The Village People's YMCA. The whole thing leaves you with a yearning to watch the whole Scary Movie series back to back where this idea was done so much better, such a shame as the Wayans brothers could probably have made this promising idea work better.

It makes me wonder why \"Scary Movie\" worked as a comedy and as a spoof, yet those who collaborated upon it have failed miserably when making their own spoof movies in a similar vein.\n\nOf course, I'm talking mainly about Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, two out of the six writers of \"Scary Movie\" who went on to make abominably unfunny parody films like \"Date Movie\" (2006) and \"Meet The Spartans\" (2008). In fact, the reason I wanted to see \"Stan Helsing\" in the first place was because Friedberg and Seltzer had absolutely nothing to do with it. However, while \"Stan Helsing\" is slightly more deserving of a theatrical release than anything by Friedberg and Seltzer, it shouldn't be commended simply because it sucks a little less than \"Date Movie\".\n\nIn fact, you can tell just how desperate this movie is when the opening credits read \"Stan Helsing: A Parody\". Whenever a comedy tells an audience in writing what sub-genre it is, you may want the next hour and a half of your life back already.\n\nStan Helsing (Ashton Kutcher lookalike Steve Howey) is a clerk at Schlockbuster Video (Yep, that's the name of the place). In one of the worst set-ups to any story, he is ordered by his manager to deliver a set of videos to the boss's mom. The problem is that it's Halloween, and his friends are picking him up in their van to go to a party.\n\nHis best friend Teddy (Kenan Thompson) is dressed as Superman (reminding me immediately of Thompson's recurring character Superdude from his days on Nickelodeon's \"All That\" (1995)), and has two gorgeous ladies in the van with him. Stan's ex-girlfriend Nadine (Diora Baird) is allegedly dressed as an Indian, but is scantily clad enough to make any man in the audience not care. Teddy's squeeze is ditsy stripper Mia (Desi Lydic), who changes costume in a relatively clever running gag.\n\nReluctantly, Teddy drives Stan to deliver the videos first, but of course they get lost. Stan keeps hearing that his ancestor is Van Helsing, who is described in this film as a monster killer. Of course, anyone with the slightest familiarity with vampire movies (not necessarily novels) will know Van Helsing as the man who hunts down Dracula in the Bram Stoker novel of the same name.\n\nI guess some people's minds have been poisoned by the Hugh Jackman vehicle, \"Van Helsing\" (2004). In that film, Jackman, as Helsing, attempts to kill not only Dracula, but Frankenstein's monster and the Wolf Man. The movie bombed, and came out six years before this one, thereby making it not very ripe for parody.\n\nAnyway, rather than Stan Helsing taking on the classic Universal monsters, he finds he has to kill more modern horror movie villains: Freddy Krueger (\"Nightmare on Elm Street\"), Michael Myers (\"Halloween\"), Pinhead (\"Hellraiser\"), Leatherface (\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\"), Jason Voorhees (\"Friday the 13th\"), and Chuckie (\"Child's Play\"). The people playing these monsters not only look nothing like the originals, but they are also each equipped with cheap gags. Freddy Krueger wears a large watch around his neck a la Flava Flav, Pinhead has darts protruding from his head, Leatherface carries a leaf blower instead of a chainsaw, and Michael Myers wears a yarmulke.\n\nYes, you read that right: Michael Myers wears a yarmulke. Why? Well, that character wears a white-washed Captain Kirk mask, and Captain Kirk was played by William Shatner, who is Jewish, I guess. The point is, these props don't make you laugh for very long, and mostly remained unexplained.\n\nIn an even more wasted role, the late Leslie Nielsen just plays a guy in drag. Yeah, that's it. If someone had tried to call him Shirley, it may have been funny, but he just shows up, is in women's clothing, and that's really about it.\n\nThere's also a tired Michael Jackson/pedophile joke that goes nowhere. Given that the film came out in 2009, the year Jackson died, the timing of the gag couldn't have been worse. The main cast isn't funny, the story makes absolutely no sense and goes nowhere, and there's an even dumber climax involving a karaoke contest. It doesn't even seem worth it to commend this film for not making outdated pop culture references.\n\nIf you find yourself falling asleep during this film, just hope that Freddy Krueger appears in your dream and slashes this film reel to bits. At least that way, your dream will be more entertaining than this movie."

If the idea of Michael Myers (now called Mikey) wearing a yarmulke makes you laugh then a) you're a fricking idiot that should have been aborted and b) you might like this crap. The only reason to keep watching this is Diora Baird, literally couldn't take my eyes off her. The only 'joke' worth commenting on is the Michael Jackson pisstake. This shows that somewhere lay some comical balls of steel, or they stupidly forgot to edit it out. Probably the latter. It's a shame this was one of Nielson's last films, as it is quite the embarrassment."

Don,t waste your time watching it . You will be disappointed. It,s attempt of being humorous is actually more entertaining than what they intended to be entertaining. The whole time i was watching this movie i was waiting for it to get funny but it never did. I am kinda assuming that they had a low budget because of the quality of the movie But they chose to do a movie with to many actors that are all terrible rather than paying a better script writer or doing a better job on the costumes. The only way this movie would be acceptable would be if it was fan made. I don,t even know why they released this movie in general or how it ever made it across the sea Im just happy i got it free with another DVD rather than paying for it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, against my better judgment I decided to watch Stan Helsing today. I am a very big fan of both the horror and comedy genres, however I quickly realized that some things should never be combined. Even though this movie did have a moment or two that could be considered funny, I found the hardest thing about watching this movie was trying to sit through the final 15-20 minutes, that took a lot of will and discipline on my part.\n\nParodies in general are difficult to pull off, but when this film included some of my favorite serial killers such as Jason, Freddy, Chucky, and Leatherface I thought it had some material to work with, and had potential to be decent. However, almost every joke attempt came off as lame, immature, and just not funny. Like I said, there were a couple of jokes here and there that managed to get a smirk, but most of them, even the funny ones, missed the mark. The best thing about this movie, and the sole reason I gave it a whole star was because of the terrific performances (umm..okay outfits actually) of Diora Baird and Desi Lydic. Both of these women were dressed in revealing Halloween costumes throughout the entire movie.....well played.\n\nIf you like parodies, than you may get a kick out of Stan Helsing. Everyone else should avoid this movie like the black plague."

Mia (Desi Lydic) was entertaining as was Stan Helsing (Steve Howey). Teddy (Kenan Thompson) felt more like he was there to satisfy some quota. Watchable, once."

After that they meet the likes of Freddy Krueger, Pinhead, Chucky, Jason Voorheas, Leatherface & Michael Myers. Stan must stop the horror icons before they take over the town and kill all the people of the town. They expect him to do it because he's Van Helsing. WTF!? First of all I want to talk about how they mucked up the horror icons. Chucky looks like a rag elf from one of those Santa Claus films. Jason wears a hockey mask but giving him an entire hockey uniform was just going too far. They mucked up Freddy with his finger knives (Tooth brush, lip stick :(. They even made him look gangster.\n\nPinhead is needle head and he looks like the solar system. Umm, really weird Michael Myers as they gave him red, rosy lips and Leatherface isn't even Leatehrface because he has tubes coming out of his head; he has a metal mask and no chainsaw. Instead they gave him a bloody leaf blower. Even the deaths towards these horror icons was just F****d up.\n\nAs we go to the main characters Stan, his ex girlfriend, and his two other friends (in which I don't remember their names). The main characters are stupid and messed up. Adult humor has just gone to far in these stakes of this film.\n\nI liked the first half of the film, but when the second half came along, it just dropped this film to the ground. The scenes are stupid, the humor is not even funny and I'm disappointed that they screwed up Chucky & Michael. Stupid film 4.9/10"

It was jarring to see Leslie Neilson's getup but his delivery was razor sharp and their interaction in the club was very funny.

He's always hilarious!) and also the unbelievable eye-popping beauty of Diora Baird. Wow! I could watch her on screen like this with her just standing there not even delivering any lines. What a knockout.\n\nThe supporting cast is solid as well.\n\nThe legendary Leslie Nielsen in one of his final roles. Respect.

So to the people saying this is a rip off of the scary movies, this is actually a spin off. Well scripted and very funny, the main character run from unscary \"scary\" movie characters that have been haunting peoples dreams for ages now. The comedy comes from the stupidness of all the characters, it is not supposed to serious at the slightest bit. The people who can not laugh at this movie have no actual humor. The characters have so much bad timing in this movie that it leaves the whole movie action packed and chopped with humor. The fact that every time they were in danger and easily escaped is the funniest of all. All the misrepresentations, sexual innuendos, \"close encounters\", and funny friend scenes is what makes this an all around funny movie. I have recommended this to all my friends and so far all twenty something have got back to me with the same comments i am posting. The funniest of all though is all the critics of this movie who were obviously not in the mind set to laugh, tareing this movie apart. Great movie and a must watch to all comedy loving fans."

They actually did have some funny moments, some clever jokes... again stuff that has been missing from all other parody films.\n\nOverall the film it isn't as bad, maybe if it came a few years back it would have been much better received but since this area has been done and redone so many times... it is just another one of those films:) Watch it if you have nothing better to do, not really worth the cinema price but good if you can borrow it.\n\nBecause of the women and sexual nature, hoink hoink:) the film is probably suitable for a male audience... so get your mates around have some beers and enjoy it."

Which he succeeds in some parts.\n\nThis is not strong though as a real film, the title \"Stan Helsing\" has to be the worst title next to \"I Still Know What You Did Last Summer\" or \"Friday After Next.\" If you guessed it, it's a parody of \"Van Helsing\" and other pop culture, cult classic horror movies.\n\nIt focuses on Hellraiser, A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Last House on the Left, and Friday the 13th. All parodied carelessly and very low class. They have to use lines like \"We have to go on to 428 Elm Street. It's the last house on the left.\" To emphasize it's a parody.\n\nThe plot, if there is one, involves a group of teenagers (Kenan Thompson, Steve Howey, Diora Baird, and Desi Lydic) trying to get to a costume party. When Stan Helsing (Steve Howey) needs to drop off some movies, he convinces Teddy (Kenan Thompson) to drive out of his way to do that.\n\nThey encounter many foolish and stupid acts in the movie, the two girls, portrayed almost like dropouts, Nadine and Mia (Diora Baird and Desi Lydic) are traveling with the slackers, and surprisingly going along with there pranks. Mainly Mia, who is the stupidest character next to Ed from Good Burger.\n\nThere is not much good about this movie. I have to say though, since it is very similar to the nostalgia the Scary Movie Franchise. It's not horrible, but still not very good. I enjoyed The Scary Movie Franchise, but didn't like the fourth one much.\n\nKenan Thompson is the highlight of this movie, but he can't do much when in between a rock and a hard place with this un-inspired script.\n\nDirector, Bo Zenga, who has helped write the script for \"Soul Plane\", will definitely have one long career if he relies on stupid parody movies to hold himself down.\n\nStarring: Kenan Thompson, Steve Howey, Diora Baird, and Desi Lydic. Directed by: Bo Zenga."

The bazillion references like \"...yeah, it's the last house on the left.\" That was fun, too.\n\nIn a lot of ways, this movie felt like it was a comic book adaptation. The premise is good enough. Stan Helsing is in denial about being a Van Helsing. Heck, this movie is at least as good as \"Van Helsing\" and \"The Brothers Grimm.\" Desi Lydic as Mia, an erotic dancer turned massage girl; she was just fun.\n\nDiora Baird as Nadine, was clearly picked to be a look-alike for Courteney Cox from \"Scream.\" Still, she was immensely watchable in the movie.\n\nKenan Thompson fell a bit flat at times, but was fun, too.\n\nIt's a send-up of teen slasher flicks and when it worked, it was fun.\n\nSome movies, you just give up watching... or fast forward to get it over with quicker... this one, for whatever reason, I kept watching. I guess hoping (pulling for?) the next little gem to make me smile."

Punk bands make millions, going on tour and selling albums. They all became rich. And when you're rich, its hard to stay angry at the world. The fuel, the spark that started it all was gone. If you've watched The Dark Knight, there's a line in there that fits perfectly: You either die the hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain. Those were the two options punk had. either quit at the top of their game, or continue on making money, but become total posers. This point is where most bands broke up. they said \"screw it, we've gone as far as we can\"."

To sum up a short review, the movie was great in my eyes, cool, had horror in it, the acting was funny and good, cool music and effects.\n\nI wouldn't listen to someone saying all this dumb stuff about a movie saying its not funny or the acting sucks, just watch it for yourself and you will see the true beauty."

Holy crayola six hundred characters to write a review? What is this English Literature class? I'm not writing a mid-term here, eh. You know what I don't even want to read a review that's six-hundred characters long. I would also like to thank the ladies costume department. If you are looking for something to finish off your popcorn and daiquiris this should do it just fine. You can turn out the lights because this will not scare you. So make some popcorn and daiquiris and let it roll."
