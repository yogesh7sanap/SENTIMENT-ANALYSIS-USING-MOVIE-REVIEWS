I would like to highlight the following facts for a non Hindi speaker. The acting is intentionally over the top.\n\nIt's a spoof movie. Spoofing many of the clich\u00e9 Indian movie scenes.\n\nDo not watch if you can't understand Hindi. This movie simply can't be translated. The film have so many rhyming dialogues which can't be translated to other language while maintaining the humor. The movie has dialog which feel funny to Hindi speaker but not to Non Hindi speakers.This I realized with my dutch friend.\n\nThis is the reason I don't watch Korean comedy films although I'm a huge fan of Korean movies. The humor gets lost while translating."

Story is of two wastrels whose only aim is to get rich and famous by any which ways. They come across one such way when they find out that a rich NRI is coming India to get married. Rest of the story is about oneupmanship and how these wastrels try to out wit each other. Entire cast is perfectly cast right from Deven Verma till Viju Khote. Songs are rightly placed and are funny. Surprise package is Salman who acts with perfect timing and this particular act gave him his style of comedy.\n\nAll an all a fum film which you should not ignore if you like and watch Indian Cinema."

        "review_detailed_main": "There have been very few great comedy films in the history of Hindi Cinema. Andaz Apna Apna happens to be one of them. The film is based on a very simple story of two poor young men (Aamir and Salman) who dream of becoming rich by marrying a millionaire's daughter (Raveena). Aamir and Salman Khan try their best to outwit each other and woo Raveena. The plot thickens when Paresh Rawal & Co. plan to take over all the wealth. The movie is well paced and very funny. Rarely does one come across a Hindi comedy which is both funny and intelligent. This is one of the few films with Aamir and Salman together (probably the only film!). Unfortunately it did not succeed at the box-office, and we might never see a film of this calibre again. Aamir Khan is brilliant in the film and has proved his versatility as an actor in this film. Salman Khan gives a very good performance as a dim-wit. Raveena plays a convincing role as a confused rich girl, and Karishma who is Raveena's assistant/friend is also funny. Paresh Rawal, Junior Ajith, Shakti Kapoor, Deven Verma, Jagdeep and Tiku Talsania just add to the flavour of the film! All in all, the best Hindi comedy ever made and I wish they make more quality films like this one. You will want to watch this film time and again.\n\nP.S - For those of you who have watched this film, I also suggest Gol Maal, Chupke Chupke, Chhoti Si Baat, Naram Garam, Hera Pheri (old and new), etc."

        "review_detailed_main": "There are some movies that are loved by almost everyone who you come across and yet happen to be box-office failures. Andaz Apna Apna, an intelligent and hilarious comedy falls in that catogory. For once, an Indian director has kept in mind the sensibilities of the audience, and not churned out a Kader Khan type stereo-typical hoax. The movie is about two guys who dream of riches, and try to accomplish that by wooing a millionaire's daughter. A humorous drama unfolds while a lot of complexities surface in the story. The complexities add to the sheer comedy of the entire plot. Aamir Khan plays the a street-smart guy, while Salman Khan gives an unexpectedly good performance as the dumb guy. The villian played by Paresh Rawal,and his henchmen, Junior Ajit and \"Kaliaa\" make you laugh in your sleep. Although the movie borrows from a lot of other movies, despite shoddy camerawork, and despite being \"loud\" at times, it remains one of the scarce \"funny\" movies Bombay has come up with after movies like Padosan, Golmal and other Amol Plaekar movies. It is sad that it didn't do well at the box-office, for that means producers turn back to formulas and creativity is abandoned."

Karisma Kapoor's outfits tell a story of their own - makes you wonder if the stylist deliberately made her wear some of the clothes just to make the movie funnier (at one point she looks like she's wearing a nappy). Andaz Apna Apna is the only comedy genre movie to make me laugh from the beginning till the very end. There is not one dull moment, every scene is hilarious, even the songs and dance moves will have you in stitches of laughter. I especially loved the scene in which Amar (Amir Khan) 'regains his memory'. I've seen this movie so many times I've lost count. And I'm so glad to say that this time Bollywood can take all the credit for this fantastic movie as far as I know A.A.A it is not a replicate of a Hollywood movie (THANK GOD). Overall I recommend this movie to anyone who understands Hindi/ Urdu and loves good comedy.\n\nWatch it you'll love it!!!!!"

It never lags, it never slows down, it is a movie that has a wonderful flow to the plot. That along with the brilliant writing makes this an awesome movie. Aamir and Salman are outrageous, even Raveena and Karishma are funny in this movie. Paresh Rawal and Shakti deliver some great bad guy comedy, but Viju Khote and the Ajit-wannabe are the best with their dumbfounded bad-guy intentions. If you want to laugh, and enjoy a movie, watch this movie, do it with family or friends, you will not regret it. Most indian movies tire me out by the end, cause they are 3 hours long. This movie is just as long, but I wish there was more when it ends, cause it's an amazing flick."

It has the broad vaudevillian comedy with the prerequisite song and dance. Comedy often struggles to cross national boundaries. Reading subtitles is an extra hurdle that one must fight through. Aamir Khan and Salman Khan are both charismatic performing fools. Their madcap antics are light fun. It's the broadest of comedy in the old fashion sense and one can feel the fun."

The actors in this movie have become wonderful and performers of Indian cinema, and may be be call it as Indian cinema, But when we talk about this movie, it cannot be in the top 250 list. The rating system should be a little more output oriented. This review and rating is purely on my personal opinion. I am a big fan of Indian cinema. And more over the rating came from just 25k votes, That system should be changed. For a movie to be rated in top 250 , it should have a minimum number of votes . that is my personal opinion."

        "review_detailed_main": "Andaz Apna Apna is a movie that I treasure and its one movie, I don't mind seeing at any time... well almost any time! This movie is simply marvelous and according to me, is the funniest movie I've ever seen! And yes, I do put it over Hera Pheri... reason? Hera Pheri has scenes you'll watch out but Andaz Apna Apna? Not possible! Simply because every scene is a scene you got to watch out for! Aamir & Salman share great chemistry and are perfect in their shoes but I'll put the characters in order of favoritism:\n\nRank # 1. Crime Master Gogo (Shakti Kapoor's best performance till date and yes, this happened before the casting couch): Gogo is an innocent character who belongs to well reputed family of Mogambo (Mr. India fame). Crime Master Gogo is actually Mogambo's nephew but for Mogambo, he's more than a responsible, handsome, charismatic charming son. Gogo, makes the biggest mistake of life by lending 36,000 rupees to Teja (who is as Balla had once said, \"A Fraud and a Cheat!\"). Now, Gogo's only goal is to get back what's his and in his journey of recovering his lost money, Gogo realizes that there is more than 36,000 that he needs to achieve and thus begins... Gogo's struggle against the sinner-world.\n\nRank # 2. Teja (Teja Main Hoon, Mark Idhar Hai!): Teja is an evil character who is Ram Gopal Bajaj's twin. Originally named Shyam Gopal Bajaj, Teja chooses to change his name to suit his personality. Teja, as a child had always envied his brother and then one day, things took a turn for the worse when his father gave his entire wealth to Ram Bajaj. Teja decided to kill his father but in the night's darkness, instead killed Munshi Harish Chandra (Raveena's Dad), though Teja doesn't regret his actions. Teja's sole mission, now, is to get back his property somehow and start his own Poultry & Bakery Farm. Teja also needs to return back the loan to Gogo (but has no intentions whatsoever to do so). In order to achieve his evil goals, Teja employs two people: Robert (Vijay Khote, who is very good at aiming) and Balla (Shahzad Khan, Ajit's clone and son... who is a very very smart boy!)\n\nRank # 3. Amar (Aamir Khan): Wants to marry the rich heiress Raveena, so he sells his father's cheap saloon and heads off for Mumbai. Amar, has no problem taking care of the big business that Raveena's father will hand him over after their wedding and is willing to sacrifice his happiness and shift to London, if needed.\n\nRank # 4. Prem (Salman Khan): After Gogo, Prem is the second most innocent character to appear in the movie and the way Amar tries to take advantage of him in the mask of a friend, is tragic.\n\nI won't reveal any more characters because Jesus Christ! I just wouldn't stop typing! The movie is outright stunning! Go and get the DVD now and beware of those cheap VCDs as they have omitted many good scenes out of the movie.\n\nThe background music is stud and the action is better than the Matrix, especially the final encountered between Prem and Crime Master Gogo (watch out for it), it appears in the climax. Andaz Apna Apna is also a drama with many negative and positive characters and teach us a lot about life and values and ethics. It teaches us about bravery (why else would Amar ask Prem to stay back when they go to meet the kidnapper, even though Prem was complaining that he had to go to the toilet???). Andaz Apna Apna is also a tragedy, especially the scenes where Salman is targeted by Aamir and is given overdose of stomach-upsetting pills, the part where Teja reveals his sad feelings regarding why he couldn't go to London and the part where Gogo is arrested in the ending, without even getting back his 36,000. Andaz Apna Apna is overall a complete package.... sit back and enjoy the ride! Bet there'll be a second ride after that... and then a third!\n\nThe movie was considered a flop back then and I bet no one liked it but buckle up guys! This movie is a big hit! Even if it didn't have enough people coming to theatres, the movie is one of the highest selling Home DVDs and one of the most frequently movie on most of the channels so the producers have laughed their way to the banks long time back!"

Performance wise, Aamir proves that he can act really bad and weird at times, Salman is not and never was a good actor. However, acting was never a requirement for this movie.

Story line in simple a Billionaire's daughter come to India for marriage and Two young chaps r behind her ,the story has a twist as well with a connection of a Gangster .Aamir playing a street smart guy Amar has played his role with brilliance and Salman has played the role of an innocent stupid to perfection.Raveena has done fine ,but Karshima really turns irritating in some sequences .But real show stealer r Paresh Rawal and Shakti Kapoor ,they enter the frame and automatically u start laughing .

Whenever he got hit during a fight scene, you could hear him squeal. Viju Khote is the dumbfounded Robert a.k.a. \"Rabbit\". I love that Shakti Kapoor a.k.a. \"Crime Master Gogo\". Paresh Rawal's double role is so awesomely hilarious for his portrayal as Ramgopal Bajaj & Shyamgopal Bajaj. Raveena Tandon and Karishma Kapoor are out of this world. My brother does a really good mimicry of Bhalla saying. \"Relax. PLEASE relax.\" I love the scene in which Aamir Khan puts a laxative in Salman \"Muscles\" Khan's food which caused the irregular bowel movements forcing him to use the toilet umpteen number of times."

        "review_detailed_main": "AAA is definitely among Bollywood's funniest movies of the last 15 years. Thanks to Aamir and Salman's comedic talent, the movie starts off well and is downright hilarious during 70% of its length, but sadly begins to lose pace during the final 30 mins. or so. I don't mind cheesy slapstick humor, but what I do mind is cheesy humor targeted at 6-10 year olds. Some of Salman and the 'Goondas' antics during the 2nd half are downright stupid, and NOT funny. Stuff like 'crime master gogo' may appeal to people who laugh too easily....but it ain't my cup of tea.\n\nNonetheless, barring the final 35 mins. or so and the occasional silly humor, AAA is a laugh-riot not to be missed led by Aamir and Salman's great performances. The chemistry shared between these two is something we probably haven't seen shared between any two actors since. Karishma and Raveena have also lend in fine support. Paresh Rawal's double role is a standout among everybody else. Overall, AAA is a hilarious flick with good repeat value."

The movie has a rating average of 4.3 of the top 1000 voters, which is rating for a bottom rated movie.\n\nI've already seen quite some Hindi movies. My conclusion is most Hindi movies are just average quality. Indeed there are exceptions. The movie 'Dangal' is a good (not super as 8.9 on IMDb) I prefer that IMDb would only list the decent movies in their Top 250. Something remarkable in the top250: Almost all recent Hindi movies are starring Aamir Khan. It's an OK actor, but sorry it's not possible that all his movies are Top250 worthily (with exception maybe 'Dangal'.\n\nIMDb should really redefine the factors, which define a movie for the IMDb Top250 movie.\n\n(1) Top 1000 voters should be an important factor (2) Amount of votes (3) Is the movie new or old. (To avoid hype movies, but also introduce classic movies) ++ Movies should earn there place ++, timeless is also important. (4) Last but not least >> Origin of the voter: Example: An Hindi movie rated by an Italian or American, should have a bigger impact, than an Hindi person.\n\nI'm a Dutch speaking guy, where are used to see several movies in other languages than on native language. This also opens our eyes, regarding what makes a movie good or bad.\n\nI can understand that sometimes you are not always objective in your rating. But I would also understand if rating of foreigners would have a higher weight on the movie. This can make people discover new movies in other languages. Japanese/Swedish/German/Spanish/French movies can be really good."

The story is simplistic, and not much could be said about the filming, or the 4 minute song sequences. Even though the acting is average, the film scores in its genre of silly comedy and infantile dialogues.\n\nWith characters named like 'Crime Master Gogo', bimbos and eccentric caricatures of old Hindi film villains (including Mogambo), there is not a dull moment in the entire film. Aamir Khan and Salman Khan on the screen gel well together. One of the reasons why every scene of this film has tremendous recall value in India, is because it has been screened an insane number of times on TV, and since its forte lies mainly in scene-to-scene situational humour, one would never really need to see the entire movie to enjoy it. So almost everyone would have seen some part of this movie in India. In that way, the absence of any serious plot has actually been helpful in making it a cult comedy.\n\nOverall, a classic of deserving fame."

For anyone that is crusading to complete the list, you may have the unfortunate time to have to view this film. Why it has been rated so high is well beyond me, but it is there for now.

The Director Raj Kumar Santoshi has given us Many Hits like Ghayal and Khakee. He goes one big step ahead with this movie. Aamir Khan is superb in the most funniest role he has given us. Salman Khan is Very amusing in one of his Best Comedies ever. The actresses are not too bad, Raveena and Karishma. The supporting cast are very good. Paresh Rawail is terrific as usual in a double role. Shakti Kapoor is amazingly funny as the cartoonic Bollywood freaky villain named Crime master Gogo. This is a non stop 2 in a half hours entertainment. This is definitely worth the price, A Must See."

And it has Aaamir Khan in it, in tight pants, so how bad could it be?? The music is great, but the dancing...eek.

The acting is also below par standard. Over the course of duration, it becomes dull and irritating. Many remakes have been made based on this movie that are far more better than this one. Like \"Ullathai Allitha\" in Tamil. There are lot more funny movies that deserve far better than this one. Hope my review makes it clear to the common cinema fan."

Personally I have found these films hit or miss, and Andaz joins the clear misses. Films with almost a perfect rating need to justify themselves. Certainly a victim of high expectations, Andaz failed to update or improve comic shticks that were unoriginal fifty years ago. Energetic and upbeat, this film had its heart in the right place, but could rarely elevate jokes above the \"smirk\" level. Every character was initially amusing, but their simplicity and lack of evolution aggravated the already substantial run time. The music was not even memorable. This is not to say I hate the movie or was even particularly bored. Hijinks were certainly abound. I was never surprised by any outcome, but was at least amused watching each bit of chicanery unfold. Humor is arguably the most subject aspect of film, and I will surely not claim that I was able to pick up every subtlety across the language barrier. I am happy for the many who enjoyed this film more than I. Andaz Apna Apna was simply not inspiring. An average film."

When you see the movie for the first time you don't know whats gonna come next and you don't focus on the subtle moments. You see it again and you get few things but still not very great for you. Now you see other set of people praising the movie like hell! You start noticing few scenes which are like a laugh riot for huge group of people but wasn't so for yourself . And when you again watch those scene to understand why others are laughing , that is the moment you get into the minute subtle moments of the film which makes it great. The movie is literally like a red wine which you like more when it becomes older i.e. when you watch it again and again . Subtle moments like Aamir displaying football with the glass and Salman taking a burp while drinking the sharbat , \"ye teza teza kya hai\" remark of Shakti Kapoor, \"Teza mai hun mark idhar hai \" of Paresh Rawal , etc and etc couldn't be enjoyed if watched for the first time by many , but these scenes become the laugh riot and defining scenes of the movie later."

This is one Indian movie which deserves its place in the IMDb Top 250. Aamir Khan and Salman Khan in probably one of their best performances in comedic roles. The thing that makes this one a time less classic is its comic timing and wonderful editing...The jokes are refreshing and not cheap.. This is one film truly ahead of its time. If you haven't seen it yet GO WATCH IT NOW !!!!!!!!!"

I have great liking for good comics like the Orgazmo,Cheech n chong, Monty Python series and many others but this one in Hindi is one of my favorite outstanding movies. Some of them recently in Hindi are Golmaal,Munnabhai series and Herapheri series. SO all i can say is Hind comedy is finally evolving. But Andaaz Apna Apna is pretty different from the movies i have said above. Its what i call the Hindi stoned comedy and very few of the kind found around 1994 in Hindi cinema.Cheers to Rajkumar Santoshi for the brilliant movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Everyone Has Their Own Style, or Andaz Apna Apna, is an Indian comedy starring Amir Khaan and Salman Khan as two good-looking losers, who decide that their way to riches is to woo a rich heiress who has returned to India to look for a husband. Unfortunately their \"romantic\" efforts are constantly interrupted by scheming bad guys, questionable plots and random comic book villains. Yes, comic book villains.\n\nWe'll return to our two main leads and their despicability in a moment. But first, let's talk about the actual comedy. This era of Indian film-making seems to think that it's the height of humour for the main character to say something that gets misunderstood, pull a funny face and get whacked on the top of their head. That's about three quarters of the jokes in this film. Stuff you would see in Looney Tunes here in the West. Except more subdued and slow because it's a life-action film.\n\nAnd I'm sorry, but that's just not funny. Perhaps it is to an Indian audience. From what I've read, this is a beloved comedy classic in India. But humour is very subjective and often very hard to translate. And this is a fine example of just that.\n\nIt doesn't help that I found the two main characters to be utterly loathsome human beings. Everything they do, they do for money. Sure, the film tries to convince you that they end up caring for the heiress and her household, but that's a lie. These two shouldn't get the girls at the end of the film. That's a horrible message to convey to your audience. A sick, disgusting message.\n\nNot a good film. This comedy is not funny, subtle or benign. If given the chance, give it a hard skip."

Examples are the superhero movies. But I respect their ratings, because I understands my limitations to appreciate them.\n\nTo illustrate my point- ANDAZ APNA APNA IS STILL EVERY BIT AS FUNNY AS IT WAS 20 YEARS AGO.

I wonder how can people consider Andaz Apna Apna to be one of the best Hindi comedies ever. The only thing I found funny about this film was that people find this film funny."

There Amir asks him for his cigarette to light his biri. After lighting up his biri he returned his biri instead the cigarette. Fun stuff.

I thought Salman Khan was the most ridiculous star in Bollywood, but Aamir Khan (who is great in LAGAAN) matches him every step of the way, both of them being grating knuckleheads (not to mention the horrible fashion sense and bad mullets). The sad thing is there actually are some decent comic ideas in the script, but it's all executed so amateurishly and clearly aimed at the lowest common denominator. There were a few moments I found myself having fun with it, but then something stupid would happen and ruin it all over it again. Even the songs are disappointing. Ugh."

We don't need this movie to be among the most iconic comedies of Indian cinema.\n\nNow, let's call the film what it really is, it's iconic alright, due to Salman and Amir being together and making a slapstick that can be termed as mindless comedy. But the sheer amount of stupidity and borrowed dialogues really tries to make you stop the whole thing, but you just survive in order to complete the thing thinking that this is the only time we are seeing these two guys together and it should be funny afterword.\n\nThis is the trend shown by the film on Imdb as well, where it was the highest rated Bollywood movie at a time and now it's down to a more reasonable 61st position, which is still high given that original good comedies like Welcome don't feature in the list, but the rank is sure to increase once more people see it in search of good cinema and find it underwhelming.\n\nJaane Bhi do yaaro was much better just on the fact that it at least came before this and hence was more original."

If you watch this movie thoroughly, you will notice the hero of the movie is the script, the screenplay, the dialogues, the situations, the context, and everything else that is similar. Never ever you will feel that something or some situation is being thrust upon the audiences. You will laugh at all the small things in this movie, if you notice. For example, the random money that the guys give to shyamgopal Bajaj, the number is also funny, INR 8535.29.

But that's its charm. Santoshi's Screenplay is hilarious & offers tremendous scope for spontaneity. While he Directs this wacky tale with such freeness & energy, its hard to lose focus at any given time. Watching the nutty protagonists fight for love, money & madness, thoroughly engages you!\n\nThe Performances are flat-out hilarious too. Aamir Khan & Salman Khan are the comedic duo of, perhaps, all-times! As Amar & Prem respectively, the Superstars are at their funniest best & their on-screen camaraderie is the highpoint of the enterprise. Raveena Tandon & Karishma Kapoor willingly add to the craziness, while Paresh Rawal is mesmerizing in dual roles. Viju Khote & Shehzad Khan are superb too. But its Shakti Kapoor's Tour-De-Force as Crime Master Gogo, that merits the highest praise.\n\nOn the whole, 'Andaz Apna Apna' is comedic magic!"

After the dime-a-dozen masala potboilers of the 80s (not to take away anything from the films of that decade: different times, different sensibilities) Andaz Apna Apna was like a breath of fresh air. The antics of the entire cast leaves the viewers in splits. The comedy might be a bit slapstick and the editing a bit shoddy, but the performances seem at ease. I remember watching this movie in the theater: the laughter never died: it was one gag after the other.\n\nEven after all these years, I remember all the dialogues in the movie. And like another all time great Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron, this movie does come up for discussion each time my friends and I watch any new comedy to come out of the Hindi film industry, serving as a benchmark.\n\nP.S.

First of all, yes there are many people who enjoy this movie due to nostalgic reasons. If you are someone who wants to watch this movie past the year 2015 and you've never seen it before, then yes the movie might seem really outdated. However, I think you need to give it a chance! When the movie first released, it was considered a flop! It began to gain recognition later on. So, one cannot dismiss it based on its release date.\n\nI watched this movie when I was a kid and I laughed at the awfully choreographed fight scenes because I thought they looked stupid. Now, I am in my mid-twenties and every time I watch this film, I remind myself that this movie doesn't take itself seriously. So why should I?\n\nThe performances are great, especially Aamir Khan's acting. Even the \"villains\" are hilarious, and Paresh Rawal is a wonderful actor. I would have to say my favorite character was crime master Gogo (Shakti Kapoor). He is supposed to be the bad guy, but he's pretty naive and every scene of his is wonderfully humorous.\n\nI've watched this movie countless of times, and each time I laugh from beginning to the end. It's original, and it's comic genius! Every single scene, song, dialogue, and behavior is intentionally meant to make its audience laugh. It's a silly movie that doesn't shy away from laughing at itself. The best thing about this movie is kid friendly. It doesn't rely on vulgarities to make its audience laugh.\n\nIf you just want to sit back and watch a light comedy, then this is it!\n\nI would like to add that it might not be as funny to those who do not speak or understand Hindi. This movie's humor is highly specific and there are a lot of rhyming jokes that just would not work via subtitles or dubbing. It can get lost in translation."

While I have seen at least a couple hundred, which is very unusual for an American, compared to most Indians I am far from being an expert! In fact, I have noticed that nearly all the films I have seen and reviewed from India were made after the mid-1990s. Now I mean no offense by this, but I notice a HUGE difference in the quality of the films made before this and after. The earlier films tended to have poor sound (the dance music sounds canned), the acting is broader quality-wise most of these earlier films don't come close to the quality of Hollywood's productions. But this definitely has changed in recent years, and now often Indian movies are among the best and highest quality you can find.\n\nI decided to watch \"Andaz Apna Apna\" even though it is an older Indian film because I have so enjoyed the movies of Aamir Khan....and Salman Khan to a lesser extent. But I soon realized the film would not appeal to me for a variety of reasons. The sound quality was terrible...cheap and flat. The acting was broad and over-the-top...and about as subtle as an episode of \"Benny Hill\" (at best). Finally, the film makes many references to films made before 1994 and apart from a few films where and there and the very realistic movies of Satyajit Ray, I just didn't understand the references. Had I been Indian and grew up with the films, I am sure I would have appreciated it much more.\n\nSo this is my verdict. If you like older Indian films and don't mind ridiculous comedy (accompanied by funny sound effects and broad overacting), you'll probably love it. But for westerners not in love with older Indian films, it will be a chore to finish."

But Andaz Apna Apna is a class apart. Comedy in this movie is not cheap, it does not involve any cheap adult dialogue or comments like western comedies. It has very simple dialogues and body gestures which makes you laugh, which gives the sense that the writer and director has really worked hard on the movie so that every section of the society can enjoy it. You got to understand Indian humor in order to enjoy this movie. I feel sorry for western or other countries audience they will miss this super comedy. I have watched it like 10000 times and I still watch it and will do so till I live. Thank you Raj Kumar santoshi for making this movie."

I know many who have called it ahead of its time, probably because it bombed at box-office. However, I think any generation can relate to this movie and have a good laugh through out.\n\nI am personally glad that Mahmood is part of the movie too.

Starring Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Raveena Tandon, and Karisma Kapoor in lead roles, the film has achieved a cult status over the years and is widely regarded as one of the funniest films in Indian cinema.\n\nThe comedy-drama centres on the amusing exploits of two slackers named Amar (Aamir Khan) and Prem (Salman Khan), who want to marry a rich heiress in order to get affluent. The comedy-drama centres on the amusing exploits of two slackers named Amar (Aamir Khan) and Prem (Salman Khan), who want to marry a rich heiress in order to get affluent.\n\nThey both fall in love with the same girl, Raveena (Raveena Tandon), and try to win her heart. However, their plans take a comic turn when a villainous duo, Teja (Paresh Rawal) and his sidekick Robert (Viju Khote), enter the picture with their own nefarious intentions.\n\nOne of the biggest strengths of \"Andaz Apna Apna\" is its incredible comic timing and witty dialogues. The film is packed with hilarious one-liners and slapstick humor that still manage to tickle the audience's funny bone even after all these years. Aamir Khan and Salman Khan's on-screen chemistry is fantastic, and they deliver their dialogues with impeccable comedic timing, elevating the humor to another level.\n\nThe film also features memorable supporting performances, including Shakti Kapoor as Crime Master Gogo, who has become an iconic character in Indian cinema. The music of the film, composed by Jatin-Lalit, is catchy and adds to the overall entertainment value.\n\nHowever, \"Andaz Apna Apna\" did not fare well at the box office upon its initial release. It was only in the years following its release that the film gained popularity and became a cult classic through television reruns and word-of-mouth recommendations.\n\nOverall, \"Andaz Apna Apna\" is a timeless comedy that has stood the test of time. It is a must-watch for anyone who enjoys light-hearted humor and wants to experience one of the most beloved comedy films in Indian cinema."

This is also a movie that can be seen many times across one's lifetime. Kudos to Raj Kumar Santoshi & Team for giving us 160minutes of 'Pure Happiness'.

How they convince Karishma to fall in love with one of them and how they compete with one another makes the movie, while Karishma is facing threats from a doppelganger of her own father, makes up the movie.\n\nOne of the most favorite aspects of this movie for me was the music. Each song was a gem, and since I watched it yesterday I have been listening to all the songs on loop. The music was a great call back to the classic songs of the late 70s and early 80s. Wonderful music and I loved the references within the songs to different actors and iconic songs.\n\nThe comedy of the movie was really good, it was the right amount of fun. I usually find myself bored in a lot of recent Hindi comedies, especially the Akshay Kumar ones like Good Newz and even Welcome. I just find them boring and cringey and too over the top for my taste. But Andaz Apna Apna was the perfect comedy and will from now on be my go to comedy in Hindi cinema. So glad I finally got myself to watch them.\n\nThe acting in the movie was really good and it was filled with a great star cast. I put it aside a little as I'm not a fan of Aamir Khan, although I mostly watched his post Dhoom 3 movies which had some good movies but bad acting for most part imo. But he was amazing in Andaz Apna Apna, and I definitely want to explore his 90s movies and classics more now. I love SRK because I did this kind of exploration of how he grew through 90s and 2000s, want to do it with Aamir now too. Salman was fine, he was fun to watch with his mannerisms. Paresh Rawal was a laugh riot, love the man in anything I watch, and he did not disappoint a single bit in this film. I was not very familiar with Shakthi Kapoor prior to watching AAA, but now I will remember him forever as Captain GoGo that is the most iconic comedic villain in Hindi cinema for me. I would not at all have minded a spin off after this for Captain Gogo. Raveena Tandon and Karishma Kapoor did well in their roles, I liked the twists and turns and the meta humor with their names.\n\nHonestly, after watching the film, I was surprised to learn it flopped. But I am glad it reached cult classic status and it will be one of the classic. Overall, a great comedy which everyone should try. Also please enjoy the album, it's such a banger."

Each of characters are so interesting and funny. The whole premise is ludicrous but you are drawn into it as the movie keeps you interested.\n\nI give full credit to the director and producer for assembling such a star cast and manage to get the movie on to production. The actors have all delivered justice to their roles. Let us be honest, these are not oscar winning roles that challenges these actors but there needs to some involvement and seriousness that delivers believable performance.\n\nBut more than the lead cast, it is the support cast that is memorable. How can anyone forget Crime Master Gogo or \"Rabbit\". That is what makes movie so thoroughly enjoyable.\n\nOnly thing that I would have against the movie is that not all of the music and song/dance sequence is upto the mark. Some of them are purely skippable (though understandable that it would have been difficult then to remove songs all together given the established norms)\n\nIn the end, this is a must watch movie for any Hindi movie buff and should be among the various lists of movies."

All great great actors. Harish Patel also with small cameo of Hotel clerk was played hilariously well.\n\nSongs sounds old but comic book feel gives suitable sounds.\n\nDialogues and writing is absolute deserve Oscar.\n\nAlready seen more than 1000 times infact i forgot my count..

The temple scene, vasco de gama scene only a genius can do this EPIC. And now the bad ones karishma and salman khans constantly winking scene, one the most irritating scene of the whole movie.crime master gogo is good enough to grin on your face but not as the teja who is able to create a lmfao moment whenever he comes."

The film's humor is irreverent, slapstick, and often absurd, with memorable characters and quotable one-liners that have become part of Indian pop culture. While the film was not a commercial success upon its initial release, it has since become a beloved comedy classic, appreciated for its zany sense of humor and the chemistry between its two lead actors."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you make a list of top Bollywood films which were flop when released in theatres but became a cult film in DVD, VHS etc, the one film which will always top the list is Andaz apna apna. Anyone who watches AAA will get shocked to hear that it was a flop in theatre. Though there were many cult classics like agneepath, lamhe, swades etc, they had its own share of flaws and were not entirely a blockbuster material. But AAA(barring songs) had everything right in it to become a huge money spinner. It had Aamir Khan and Salman Khan as the male leads who were young superstars at that time, Raveena tandon and Karishma Kapoor who were rising female heroines at that time, Third directorial venture and first full fledged comedy film of Rajkumar Santoshi after action drama Ghayal and social drama Damini. But poor marketing and long delay in making turned it into a complete washout winding up within three days of release. Later as it deserved became a huge sensation when it came on DVD and television. It narrates the story of Amar(Aamir) and Prem(Salman) , a lazy guys dreaming to achieve big without any hardwork. When a rich girl Raveena(Raveena tandon) comes from London to India for marrying a suitable groom, Amar and Prem comes and start hitting on her trying mostly to outsmart each other. But Teja(Paresh Rawal) twin brother of raveena's dad wants to kill her and usurp her property. How Amar and Prem saves Raveena's family from bad guys is the rest of the story. I loved the performances of Aamir Khan, Paresh Rawal, Shahzad Khan and Shakti Kapoor especially my personal favorite is Shahzad Khan as Bhalla whose peculiar dialogue delivery I love to imitate while watching. I liked Salman's performance in the climax. Heroines have nothing to do other than being a mere spectators of the chaos. The only drawback of AAA is its songs which sounded like 60's instead of 90's. But that can be forgiven for a film which is so entertaining. Rajkumar Santoshi proved his versatility in handling comedy effortlessly. On the whole AAA till now is the only madcap comedy film till now which instead of scratching your heads will put a smile on your face from start to finish"

It has achieved a cult status in the brethren of Hindi cinema and will always be remembered as one of the best comedy movies of all time. Directed by Rajkumar Santoshi this movie presents a new side of its lead actors Salman Khan and Aamir Khan. Both have done exceedingly well with their comic poise and timing. Another thing about the film is that is clich\u00e9s which would get any film panned works wonderfully for it. Names of bygone characters of Hindi cinema \u2013 Robert, Teja, Amar and Prem add to its charisma and mass appeal. Even the side characters of the movie like Shakti Kapoor, Harish Patel (lodge owner) have performed their parts brilliantly and have never let the comic intensity of the film break. Compared to the present era of comedy in Bollywood where you cannot sell joke without giving a sexual meaning to It; this movie reminds us how a cult classic is made.\n\nComing to the music of the film; the songs of the film are not worth remembering and you forget about the lyrics as soon as they get over. Though the lead players get all the applause and rightly so, you should reserve some of your applause for the dialogue writers- for me personally the scene where Aamir Khan spells out \"Aap purush hi nahi, mahapurush hai\" stands out, not just for the effortless dialogue delivery by him but also for the subtle changes in dialogue when the viewer least expects it. Leaving apart music; this movie has all its bases covered. A very good story and screenplay coupled with brilliant performance by everyone in its cast makes it my favorite Indian Comedy till date."

Pity today's film makers praise AAA but fail to learn anything from it."

I was amongst the few who saw the film as a college kid at the near empty Metro Cinema in Mumbai. I laughed my guts out at antics of Amar and Prem (Aamir's Hai-la perfectly complemented Salman's Ooi-maa) and looking at the then tepid audience response, wondered why such a rib tickling sparkling clean super slapstick comedy fail?\n\nLack of promotion, underwhelming music and then reigning Hum Aapke Hain Koun (1994) occupying most of the theatres were some of the reasons cited for the films failure.\n\nRevisiting the movie again on DVD last night with my teenage son, he casually remarked that this film would've been a blockbuster had it released today. It then struck me that perhaps this movie was a few decades ahead of its time and would've actually clicked with today's gen had it come now. Imagine watching Aamir Khan and Salman Khan together in a totally mad caper with unforgettable characters like Tejaa, Bhalla, Robert and Crime master Gogo mouthing hilarious dialogues like \"Tejaa main hoon mark idhar hai...\", \"Galti se mistake ho gaya..\", and \"Aankhen nikal ke gotiyan khelta hoon\". Every scene and dialogue of this Raj Kumar Santoshi (written and directed) venture brings atleast a smile on your face if not LOL.\n\nPlanned as a quickie, Andaaz Apna Apna took more than three years to complete and there were rumours of Aamir - Salman ego issues being the reason for the delay. However, in a recent interview, director Rajkumar Santoshi refuted these claims though he admitted that getting the actors' dates was a challenge. An additional song (Shola Shola) was recorded but not filmed keeping in mind the film's run time. The makers expected the movie to be a runaway hit but unfortunately, that was not to be..\n\nAndaaz Apna Apna is not the only hindi film which attained cult status after failing in its initial theatrical run...Raj Kapoor's Mera Naam Joker (1970) and Guru Dutt's Kaagaz ke Phool (1959) (both my personal faves too) are best examples of the failure turned classic story. Andaaz Apna Apna belongs to that elite club.\n\nRegards, Sumeet Nadkarni"
