(Should have been my first clue). The toilet humor was over done, while at times it fit the storyline, pissing in the shower was a little overboard and unnecessary. I loved Larry and gang on the Blue Comedy Tours, but this was raw sewage.\n\nAll the funny lines were in the T.V. commercial!\n\nI did notice a major blooper. During one fresh scene (next day) and the few that followed it, the shirt of Tom Wilson had a large, wet stain on the pocket of his shirt - how did it get there and did we miss a cutting room floor funny?"

        "review_detailed_main": "I played on a Baptist College baseball team over twenty years ago with Dan \"Larry the Cable Guy\" Whitney. Even back then he was only a part- time pitcher but a full time clown. I wish he had shifted his focus and concentrated more on his curve ball. If he had then perhaps we would have been spared his first feature length film---\"Larry the Cable Guy Health Inspector\".\n\nAs a \"starter\" project this movie echoes the transitions made by other comedians-- most notably Jim Carrey (Ace Ventura -Pet Detective) and less notably Rob Schneider (Deuce Bigelow-Male Gigolo). However Dan's talent is probably better compared to the late Jim Varney and his alter ego-- \"Ernest P. Worrell\". Still, I can much more appreciate Varney's eccentric talents than Dan's stubborn assault on our sensibilities by offering repeated renditions of a stock version of a crude redneck character(or has he broadened this into being somehow representative of \"blue collar crude\" in an effort to pull some of the population living north of the Ohio River into this movie's prospective demographic?)\n\nIn \"Health Inspector\" Dan manages to exhaust most of the material found in his stand up routine. He also comes up with some new bits- most of which are only incidental variations on his old bits. It's true that he does break some new ground also. We get to see Larry in love through an indirect appeal to pathos. But the sum total of this film, in the end, is that it serves as little more than a woeful compilation of \"Larry's the Cable Guy's\" rather sloppy rise into the national consciousness.\n\nThe touchstone for deciding whether or not you should give \"Health Inspector\" a chance can be found in Dan's signature stage utterance---\"Git r Done\". If the humor buried in that expression appeals to you ---then by all means check out the movie. But if the phrase leaves you lost, cold and empty---you had best give the film a pass. For my part, I have never been able to translate \"Git r Done\" into anything that quite registers as \"funny\" on my tired brain. But I still went and saw the show anyway. After all, like I said --I used to play ball with this guy in school."

It was my type of low-brow humor and I thought this is going to be a funny film. However, after I go to the theater and the picture started to play, I felt I was really duped by the trailer. Whereas the trailer was tightly edited to give great timing to the jokes, the film was edited with no regards to proper timing of set-up and punch lines. There were even added scenes in the trailer that didn't exist in the film. This was one of those films that I had to leave early from. I could not take anymore after 40 minutes."

As a matter of fact, when we heard the release date, we ensured to plan an evening around going to the theater to see this movie. I've enjoyed watching Larry the Cable Guy over the years and I knew that this movie would not be Oscar worthy, or one of the best comedies I have ever seen, but I thought it would at least be entertaining - but to our surprise, it wasn't. We were turned off within the first 10 minutes of the movie and forced ourselves to sit through the remaining 80 minutes. Usually, just hearing Larry talk is enough to make some laugh, but by the end of the movie, we even tired of that. Unfortunately, I think we will be a little gun shy in seeing any future Larry the Cable Guy movies, unless of course, , he is teamed up with the rest of the Blue Collar cast and he is doing his stand-up act. This movie isn't even worthy of watching on DVD, unless you want to hear fart gags for an hour and a half."

Nothing new or inventive here. Larry's humor was not creative. Just diarrhea jokes over and over throughout the whole entire movie! And that was the whole running gimmick! It became rather boring. This is a simple film which had the potential to be funny but destroyed it with horrible acting and boring humor."

You Got Served, Bloodrayne and From Justin to Kelly were among these unlucky ones. Oh sure they were bad movies alright, terrible movies to be blunter. But when you looked at the movies like Red Zone Cuba, Gigli and of course Manos, you couldn't really rate them as that bad.\n\nNOT THIS TIME\n\nThink of the most horrible, hateful put down you could ever attach to anyone and anything and it still wouldn't do Larry The Cable Guy justice. That's right folks. 40 years on and finally, Manos is now the world number two on the chart. This movie is the biggest piece of s**t to ever stink up the theatre. It is so jaw droppingly, blood-boilingly bad that you wouldn't even serve it to your most hated emnemy.\n\nNot only is Larry The Cable Guy the single worst most horrible movie of all time, but it is the spawn of the single worst most horrible idea of all time. The plot involves a series of food poisonings at the city's best restaurants, with the All City Top Chef contest just days away. It's up to Larry and Butlin to figure out who's sabotaging the competition, even if it means taking on the breast-obsessed mayor.\n\nGot that folks? It's another toilet humor film which sucks! And it's another film directed by a first timer (Trent Cooper)! See Deuce Bigalow for reference! In the first five minutes of the redneck comedian's film debut, we see Larry urinating on himself in the shower, flashing his butt crack, having a flatulence attack in front of his boss, and referencing the smell of \"strawberry douche.\" At this point I turn unto God and ask \"Why?\" Why does Hollywood keep doing this with impunity!\n\nTrent Cooper is only there to keep the movie in focus (he even fails that at times) and to make certain there are enough fart jokes to keep the overlong running time rumbling. Seriously, you could make DVD chapters out of the number of times Larry -- or anybody, really -- makes with the southern thunder. That is how awful this movie is. It can't even save itself with fart jokes.\n\nLarry The Cable Guy is truly the worst movie of all time. It should be driven to a quiet spot, forced to kneel down and be shot through the head. That'll learn it!\n\nNEVER WATCH THIS MOVIE."

While it did have a few funny parts, I spent most of the time in the theater teetering between pure boredom and annoyance. Unless you enjoy root canals, spinal taps, or anal probes I would avoid this one at all costs.

Then again, I don't think anyone involved was anticipating \"For Your Consideration\" ads placed in Variety come Oscar season.\n\nMaybe we don't always have to relax for two hours after working a 55 hour week at a blue collar job by watching Amistad or Boys Don't Cry. Maybe it's okay to pull a long neck Natural Light out of the fridge and watch Pauly Shore or Rob Schneider. Perhaps even Larry the Cable Guy commenting on \"a brown snake playing peek-a-boo with my butt crack.\" And for those impressing us with their tolerance and raging over Larry implying a fruity waiter is gay, or calling a woman in a business suit a \"boy,\" I have to wonder, as I often do, why white guys are the only beings on the planet who can take some ribbing without crying about bigotry.\n\nEvery single commercial that ever airs on television depicts women and minorities and especially wives as super intelligent, almost God like figures. White men are slobbering half wits who can barely speak in complete sentences. And why are their no mass protests? Because we can take it. Period. Yet Larry makes a crack about his boss being mad supposedly because he's receiving anti-gay hate mail, and all of the \"tolerence\" activists pull out the daggers.\n\nBut I digress. This is a fairly entertaining mindless 90 minute diversion. If you can't take a joke, go watch First Wives Club. If you can check your brain at the door, Health Inspector will give you a few laughs, while solving a \"premedicated\" crime."

I did have a pretty tough week this week, and in celebration of the fact that I work some long and crazy hours I did my every other week Friday Matin\u00e9e movie expecting some really crude, baseless, and thoroughly stupid humor.\n\nI was not disappointed.\n\nLarry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector is a reasonably competent movie vehicle for Dan \"Larry the Cable Guy\" Whitney, allowing for the fact that it is rife with all the flatulent, politically incorrect, crude, redneck, and every other kind of socially unredeeming humor we have come to know him for within his solo stand-up and \"Blue Collar Comedy Tour\" career.\n\nThe whole crux of this film revolves around Larry's job as a restaurant health department inspector who happens to be offending virtually every one in his path and screwing up at his job. To correct his ways or end his career, he is allied with a new partner, the virtually hermaphrodic Amy Butlin (played by suitably hermaphrodic nerd-turned-comedienne Iris Bahr). What ensues is a caper in which Larry finds a love interest, belittles his partner, laughs at his retarded neighbor, abuses a phony paraplegic, wrestles a uni-browed daughter of a crooked restaurateur, degrades all manner of human life, all while trying to solve the case of serial food poisoning. We are also treated to what Jerry Mathers looks like at the end of his career and to what became of Thomas F. Wilson (remember Biff Tannen?) as if he actually had a career as a quasi-straight (don't you think that's funny, I called Biff straight?) guy for Larry's gaffs.\n\nSound interesting? Of course not, but every crude one-liner in Larry's repertoire (new and old) is balanced against a sometimes funny sometimes lame plot. There is enough of \"Cable Guy\" humor and off-beat timing to laugh at, even some things the P.C. police would send you straight to Hell for. Ample fresh material exists to keep the not-so-funny lines from keeping the average Cable Guy fan from disliking this movie.\n\nAnyone expecting any more or less of Health Inspector is probably not a Larry the Cable Guy fan, and certainly should not see this film. If you are, however, and you just want to see about 90 minutes of absolutely insolent yet funny bathroom-style garbage disguised as humor, then by all means \"Git 'er DUN\" and see this film. It could be worse, of course, but comeonn\u0085.it's Larry The Cable Guy, NOT Shakespeare.\n\n4 out of 10 for a comedy like this means it is B-style humor worth seeing if you understand the brand of humor being presented. I did take a shower afterward though."

By the way I saw this movie outside of Cincinnati, OH. That night it began to storm pretty bad during the movie. Why do I say this? Because I came so close to wishing it would turn into a tornado and tear the screen away. It was just that bad. I am just sad for Megyn Price. I really enjoyed her in \"Grounded for Life,\" but this mess might have ruined her career. This is the kind of movie that I call a career killer, once an actor does one of these you will never seem them in a respectable film again.

But if you go expecting some cheap laughs and fart jokes, it's a home run. All I'm saying is give it a chance. Again, if you don't like Larry the Cable Guy or potty humor, skip it. But then again, if you're like me and do like those things, I'm sure you'll get a kick out of it. Don't take life so seriously. Relax, unwind, make some popcorn and watch.

Slovenly humor goes back decades, and of course is often very successful, but there may be something deviate about Larry the Cable Guy's sense of humor; it's irrelevant to his core audience--who just want to have a mindless good time with the toilet jokes--but the film's rampant ugliness belies a hatred of people that coats the whole sub-modest enterprise like pond scum. Anyone with a semblance of grace or a modicum of style or good breeding is considered a candidate for the local gay bar (the movie is very fond of putting down \"the queers\"), while Larry's unattractive co-hort is never allowed to blossom (she's all business, which to Larry means she must be kept in her place, as that of a stereotypical spinster). There's a half-hearted, played-for-jokes romance somewhere in the middle of this wretched picture, but to bring that up is really about as useful as criticizing the witlessness of the entire conception. Audiences high on this kind of low-ball humor don't want profundities or helpful criticism; they only want to see the flies in the food. This movie gives them what they want. NO STARS from ****"

If you're going to make fun of disabled people, you better be damn funny (consult the Farrelly Bros. on this) or else you will come off like a sick mean SOB\n\n2. Fart jokes are funny only if used in moderation\n\n3. Give the audience some credit: they know Larry the Cable Guy or else they wouldn't be watching the movie, so starting the movie with a butt crack shot is not really necessary (or funny)\n\nTo give credit where due, there are a couple of funny moments in this snoozefest. One is when the trailer trash mother of Larry's girlfriend-to-be mimics our hero. The other is at the end of the movie, when they drop hints about making a sequel. Now that's hilarious!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I hate it when someone on here starts comparing a movie by stating its the \"worse ever\" when the reality is they have seen much worse movies and they don't possess the intellect to simply tell others the movie wasn't worth watching without admitting they at least found a part of the movie entertaining or funny. In fact, they will deny they found ANY part of the movie funny just to rant and rave about how bad it was. I choose to compare fairly. Seriously, Larry the Cable Guy needs to stick to stand-up comedy and stay out of the movie business. I can't believe the fan following he has though. I honestly think that along WITH the other redneck comedians, he's entertaining and funny, but by himself, he's truly not that funny. I saw him live at the Houston Rodeo a few years back and Houston is FULL of rednecks and Larry lovers - ESPECIALLY at the rodeo. People loved Larry anyhow, but not too many people laughed to my recollection at anything he said. Him dragging that into another movie pretty much sets the stage for a good nap. However, I couldn't give this movie a 1 because I remember laughing if only a minute chuckle at a few scenes and somehow I did manage to stay awake through the entire movie (mostly out of curiosity). However, since I've seen Going Overboard with Adam Sandler mostly because I'm an Adam Sandler fan, I've realized that Going Overboard was even a bigger disappointment with not ONE funny scene or joke in the entire movie, thus it deserved a 1 and this movie wasn't THAT bad comparatively. If you've ever seen Rubberface which was one of Jim Carrey's first movies ever, it was also a 1 rated movie in my opinion as it was not funny at all. The difference is, Adam Sandler and Jim Carey were early in their career and went on to do some of the funniest stuff EVER and these movies were poor examples of their earlier trials that did not work. The difference is Larry the Cable Guy has already \"made it\" as a comedian being one of the highest paid comedians over the past few years, and THEN he tries to make a movie and it of course bombed. I don't see Larry the Cable Guy ever becoming in the future in the movies anything towards the talent of Adam Sandler or Jim Carrey, no matter how many times he farts in a film."

The idea of Larry the Cable Guy as a health inspector is just so fantastically ridiculous that you can't help but see how this is all going to pan out. While there is a good amount of racist and gay jokes they are used as a vehicle to mock the incredible ignorance of the white trash that makes them. Altogether I wouldn't say this movie was a classic or masterpiece, but it's entertaining in its own way and worth seeing, alternatively I would recommend it to anyone who's a fan of Larry the Cable Guy as it is a good showcase for his style of comedy."

There are some very funny scenes but they are far fetched and very unlikely for a movie. Basically its a over the top flick that tries too hard. If you were willing to pay to see the Naked gun movies at a theater than go you will probably be entertained.\n\nI must also add for the record I am a big fan of Larry's, I really like his stand up comedy and even own a CD or two,but in a movie theater it sucked.\n\nAgain it is somewhat funny so do watch it at home or on pay per view for $3 but it is not worth $7 per person plus popcorn at the local theater."

For example there is a retard (Larrys neighbour) who keeps on getting a ball in his head and falls over but still fight the vain with braveness and put his tumb up while he says I'm OK. And there also is some good spirit happiness in this movie to show the thankfulness over the things that really matters in life, for example when Larry gets his car back after it been stolen and nobody made a scratch to it.\n\nIf you need a laugh.

Now I will be the first to admit that the first time you see Larry The Cable Guy do his stand up routine he comes across as funny to many people. The second, third or fourth time, you soon realize he is just rehashing his same old stuff and loose interest quickly. This movie falls into that category. If you think farts are funny you will love this one! If you can be entertained with the same sight gags, one-liners and slapstick repeated several times in one movie, you might like this one. I rented it on DVD just to see if it was as bad as I expected, it was. My recommendation, if you want to see this one just watch a rerun on TV of his stand up routine, the jokes are the same and you won't waste as much time. I give it a 2/10 because a couple of the support actors did a good job."

We are introduced in the beginning of all his horrific imperfections, Larry the Cable Guy: Heath inspector is not a movie about him trying to hold two jobs as many of you think. No, instead he is only a health inspector and checks to make sure no restaurants are violating any hygiene codes. This movie is your basic lowbrow humor filled with none stop situational visual comedy but in it's the lowest form, along with poking fun at the mentally impaired. It doesn't get any better when in about 15-20 minutes it turns into this \"dynamic duo\" which we have all seen millions of times before. \"Rush Hour\" \"Bringing down the House\" \"Taxi\" the list goes on...So now the premises is the character \"Amy\" uptight and perfectionist meets up with..you get the idea. Included in this film are isolated gags of fart jokes, vomit, butt crack and bad bathroom humor, which is cool, but once is enough! For a second, I thought this was headed in a semi-right direction when perhaps....Amy teaches Larry how to be more productive and visa versa? No. Instead just a one dimensional plot, but hey at least there's a plot, right? No? It's that hopeless huh? Well, it was a plot even though it was tiny. If you are thinking about taking children to see this, don't. Don't expose your child to filth please, but go ahead and enjoy it on your own. Too much Larry for me, Cable Guy is alright in moderation, but man this was near lethal overdose. And of course he only wanted to distribute his stand up act all throughout the movie. But at least he showers. Anyway, it could have been worse..Like chasing a Kangaroo for 2 hours cause he has your money. Why did I see this?, God only knows.\n\n3.6/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I've never really been a big fan of \"Blue Collar TV,\" actually, I've never watched a complete episode from start to end in one sitting. But I do remember the funny antics of Larry the Cable Guy. When the first previews of this movie appeared on TV last month, I found a couple recordings of his stand up routine, and was thoroughly amused with his unique brand of humor and style of delivery.\n\nAt the bookstore, I found out that he'd written a book, \"Get-R-Done,\" containing some of his more memorable stand-up favorites. I bought it after reading just the jacket synopsis and a couple pages I flipped through at the bookstore. At home, I couldn't stop reading and laughing, as the jokes and writing just kept coming at me at a blazingly funny rate.\n\nSo when I went to watch \"Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector\" yesterday, I went with high expectations of seeing Larry's most successful stand up routines shown on the big screen without the hold-backs of network television.\n\nWhat I saw was nowhere near the funny material from \"Blue Collar TV\" or his stand up and book; rather, \"Health Inspector\" is simply the same type of attempt to generate revenue from as wide an audience as possible. Though I'm not completely familiar with his routines and style, I quickly learned to appreciate his style of delivery of punchlines and humor, but very little of it is in the movie. The passing of gas is always a great fall-back to generate stifling laughs, but when the movie sets aside entire scenes on flatulating shows the film's desperate attempts to get enough laughs to convince movie goers to convince their friends and neighbors to watch the movie. After seeing the movie's performance over it's first weekend, it's apparent that that strategy didn't work.\n\nI may not be the most familiar with Larry the Cable Guy, but after knowing his style from listening to his stand up routine, I know that Larry the Cable Guy had little or nothing to do with the writing or producing of \"Health Inpsector.\"\n\nMy advice: wait until the movie is released on DVD before you watch it; there's no need to shell out $10 like I did to watch a movie that tries so hard to be funny, it almost isn't at times."

Larry's a busy guy.\n\nI've seen a lot of dumb movies in my day, but Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector might just take the prize as the absolute dumbest. I think my IQ dropped a few points while I watched. The movie isn't much more than a continuous 80-something minute fart joke. The fart jokes go on and on and on. I didn't find the first one funny, so by the 50th, I was about ready to slit my wrists. Oh my God is this thing horrible! In between fart jokes, the movie finds time to offend just about every group imaginable. I'm not one that normally gets offended when watching a movie, but here, it slaps you in the face. Race, sexual orientation, handicaps, you name it - Larry treats them all with the same level of disdain and ridicule. It's bottom-of-the-barrel comedy.

Iris Bahr (playing the previously mentioned Butlin), Megyn Price, Joe Pantoliano, and Joanna Cassidy must have all really needed the work. I'm shocked any would lower themselves to appear in this dreck. I know they were paid, but I still feel sorry for them."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am an avid poster on these boards, and as everyone knows, I am a Larry fan. I support him and try to defend him as best I can.\n\nI went to see this movie Saturday the 25th with a couple of friends. The theater was sold out not long after my friends and I sat down. Now I'm guessing there were about 200-300 people there during that showing, and every single person laughed. I laughed a lot. I mean...A LOT.\n\nNow, as much as I have been defending it, I will say that I was skeptical before seeing it. I thought the acting would be bad, and it would be a lame movie as far as the plot is concerned. The movie didn't have the greatest writing, and the plot was a little off, and I got confused as to where the plot was going and who was involved in what throughout. But I laughed myself silly. This was what I expected, maybe a little better. The acting wasn't Oscar-caliber. But it was Larry the Cable Guy at his funniest. I give the movie a 7 out of 10. The plot and the acting put it at a 7, and it would have been lower if it hadn't been so ridiculously funny.\n\nI was outraged to see this movie at the #1 spot on the Bottom 100. It isn't THAT bad.\n\nI would like to see Larry in another movie, perhaps a buddy comedy co-starring the other Blue Collar comedians. Now THAT would be worth seeing!\n\nIn other words, if you are fan of Larry the Cable Guy, or you just like low-brow humor, including fart jokes, poop jokes, and other far out humor, then by all means, see this. If you are not a fan of Larry the Cable Guy, then I trust that you will avoid this. You won't like it. AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DON'T VOTE ON IT IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT!! If you thrive for political correctness, then you will be infuriated. If you have an open mind, and enjoy comedy, you will be hurting with laughter."

Like you'd see on an Adam Sandler movie.\n\nIt did make the usual dumb redneck jokes that the Blue Collar Boys are known for, but Larry was the only redneck in the film.\n\nI expected the neighbors to be a stereotypical hillbilly clan with an open toilet on the back deck and family members of obvious inbreeding.\n\nMany reviewers don't seem to understand that redneck humor IS making fun of the redneck lifestyle. The city folks seem to think everyone outside of their clean and highly educated cities is a dufus. It would be like country people thinking every city person is a Woody Allen neurotic.\n\nI'm lucky enough to live in between both cultures and I'll take the Good Ole Boys any day over a bunch of elitist snobs that think Wal Mart is the biggest danger to the USA.\n\nI see it had a $4 million budget. It made almost 7 Mil on opening weekend. That's called a profit, \"city slicker\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "Larry the Cable Guy reminds me of the idiot on the high school debate team who seemed to win his competitions winging-it. You know the guy; he's the one who can't spell Amazonian but manages to win the audience by saying the phrase \"save the rainforest because\u0085trees and s***.\" So it goes Daniel \"Larry the Cable Guy\" Whitney has been catapulted to super-stardom being a singularly obnoxious character comedian. His routine is infused with false goofball bravado and a bloated sense of self; callously \"standing up\" for red blooded Americans who drive a beat-up pickup truck and eat Hot Pockets for lunch out of a tin pale.\n\nI get it Middle America; Hollywood and the media are overwhelmingly liberal so out of the assortment of comedians you have to latch on to your mascot. But why would you plague us with this gleefully ignorant, aggressively offensive, boar? This film (which made a hefty profit), along with his comedy albums, standup tours and voice work for Pixar has elevated this guy's credibility. You've created a monster!\n\nIf you need proof of dear Larry's now unstoppable stupidity, look no further than his 2006 film Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector. He plays a city official who isn't particularly good at his job and doesn't really take his job seriously. So why do we care about this guy? Good question. Because of his unorthodox methods Larry is partnered with a by-the-books partner (Iris Bahr) who he constantly dubs a man due to her choice in wears and lack of voluptuousness. Funny. He then goes to a variety of ethnic restaurants with his new partner making imbecilic comments about restaurant owners and workers though because they're familiar with his banter the heed no mind. Funny. He also annoys his coworker Jack (Tony Hale) who is a paraplegic. Funny. He bungles into a mystery involving poisoned food before a local cuisine competition involving people in their Sunday best barfing and farting. Funny. Oh and there's the love story which starts with Larry staring at shop worker Jane (Megyn Price) as she removes the bras off of mannequins. Again, so funny!\n\nActually no\u0085no\u0085not funny at all! The cardinal rule of a comedy is be funny which this film is resoundingly not. Larry's character cannot provide any cleverness, insight, intuition or even irony. The man tows the line between amiable redneck and ugly American managing to isolate all but his most die hard fans. He slings his brand of gross-out humor with a soup\u00e7on of racism and sexism but any time it gets blatantly offensive he falls back into \"I'm-just-doing-me\" mode as the supporting characters catch him by being straw-men or shoulder shrugging bystanders.\n\nComedians like Groucho Marx did the thick shtick with a clever pomposity that irked the victims of his command of the English language. Jerry Lewis wasn't as sharp or presumptuous but he brought physicality to the fool role which was copied to great success by the likes of Jim Carrey. Larry the Cable Guy brings nothing to the table. His interpretation of the ignorant fool is one of a sad, second-hand Don Quixote. He looks to exemplify an ideal that never existed nor should; an Amrican who lacks all beneficial qualities but gumption and adulates his own numb-nut-ness while chomping down Moon Pies and day old pizza crust.\n\nThe saddest part about Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector is that despite naughty language, reference to bodily functions, sex and Kid Rock, the film got a PG-13 rating guaranteeing young people have and will see this asinine movie. In my youth when I lacked good taste I thought films like Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994) and Happy Gilmore (1996) were the best I've ever seen. Even today I will defend their quality while acknowledging serious filmgoers will dismiss them and deride me for them. It saddens me to think out there somewhere there are youngsters willing to defend Heath Inspector. Worse still is the notion that as they get older Health Inspector will crystallize in their minds with other \"cherished\" childhood memories.\n\nhttp://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com"

So, I looked upon it as a documentary about checking out all those folks that sell boiled peanuts on the side of the road. Have you seen those things? People actually put them in their mouth! 89 minutes of farting, bathroom jokes, and a whole bunch of derogatory remarks about women, those with developmental disabilities, gays and lesbians, you get it. This is the same thing that you find in the small minds of people who watch NASCAR. I am sure they are the biggest fans of this movie. Not one laugh in 89 minutes.\n\nTies with Beerfest as one of the lamest excuses for use of film stock that I have ever experienced."

        "review_detailed_main": "That'll go down faster than a bottle of Vicodin at Courtney Love's house.\" American stand-up comedian, actor and former radio personality Daniel Lawrence Whitney, better known as Larry the Cable Guy, starred in his first movie back in 2006 as a slovenly cable repairman-turned municipal high-class restaurant-investigating health inspector. He was one of the members of the Blue Collar Comedy tour on Blue Collar TV, a comedy troupe which included Bill Engvall, Ron White and Jeff Foxworthy. To date Larry has starred in three Blue Collar Comedy Tour-related films: Health Inspector, Delta Farce (2007) and Witless Protection (2008), both of which I will get to reviewing later on in the near future. With his stereotypical redneck rube appearance, thick Southern accent and joke-telling of questionable taste, how does he fare from his stand-up act to the big screen? Aside from being best know as voicing Mater in the popular Cars franchise, of which came out the same year as this movie, how did this one manage to slip pass the Board of Health? Let's take a look.\n\nLarry, here playing much like himself but now as a health inspector, is an uncouth, middle-aged Moon Pie-munching bachelor living in a pig- sty of an apartment and drives an over-sized, bumper sticker-clad, exhaust-spewing pickup truck. His exasperated, no- nonsense boss Bart Tatlock (Thomas F. Wilson, of whom is best remembered as Biff from Back to the Future) is tired of Larry's ways in order of getting his duties accomplished. To have him fired, he assigns Larry with a new partner named Amy Butlin (Iris Bahr), a strict, by-the-book professional of whom takes her work quite seriously as opposed to Larry's questionable practices to his job, despite the fact that he always refers to her as a \"he\" or a \"him\" due to thinking she is a man. Iris did in fact appear in the unaired pilot for The Big Bang Theory as one of Leonard and Sheldon's university colleauges named Gilda the same year Health Inspector was released. Her character turned out to be the prototype for the later developed character Leslie Winkle (Sara Gilbert), as Gilda was thusly scrapped. No wonder she acts like a female Dr. Cooper in this movie. She tries to learn the ropes, but Larry's personality in less than tolerable. However his knowledge of vermin and disarmingly disconcerted way of interviewing witnesses and suspects slowly gets him where he needs to go. After learning of a serial criminal of whom is going around intoxicating local five-star restaurants, the duo drive off to save the town from a fatal food poisoning. It is only near the film's end where the culprit is exposed at a televised taping of Top Chef. Hilarious hijinks do not ensue.\n\nPanned by critics with a five percent on Rotten Tomatoes, the website ranked Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector #85 on its \"The 100 Worst Reviewed Films Of All Time: 2000-2009\" list. And after watching this, I can definitely see why. Some portions of Health Inspector are made up of Larry rattling off double-entrendes to get a point across we the audience got the first time (\"I could do this all day\") and enlongated fart jokes that disgust rather than get even a smirk. Even seeing Larry go undercover as a copacabana dancer near the end of the movie is unpleasant to look at, especially with his protruding girth. The supporting cast is halfway decent at least, including Joe Pantoliano (The Matrix, Memento) as Mayor Maurice T. Gunn, Tony Hale (Veep, Arrested Development) as Jack Dabbs, of whom poses as a wheelchair-bound cripple in cahoots with the bad guys (I seriously think he wanted to escape from the set near the end of the movie), Donnie (David Koechner, The Office, Anchorman), Larry's kind but dimwitted, bald but pony-tailed next- door neighbor, Joanna Cassidy as a restaurant owner, a horrifying unibrowed girl side character and Larry's blonde romantic interest Jane Whitley, a sweet, shy waitress. I was satisfied that they had the dignity not to make her a stereotypical airhead and actually quite smart. She does, unfortunately, give in to flatulence in one scene with Larry, somewhat losing her dignity as a better character. Even Kid Rock makes a cameo when Larry has a fantasy: either go fishing with him or make love to Jane. Jane comments to Larry, \"Nice rod\" as he holds his pole in a questionable area of his antatomy as we know what his thoughts are. But the jokes are no doubt aimed at those of whom attend Larry's stand-up act and are indeed low-class to say for the most part regarding his schtick. I didn't expect anything less upon pressing the play button, knowing I was doing it only for the criticism.\n\nWith a budget of $17 million, Health Inspector only garnered back a sickly $15 million plus of its earnings back at the box office. The website consensus on Rotten Tomatoes states: \"An aggressively lowbrow vehicle for its titular star, this gross-out comedy fails to \"git-r-done.\" At least Larry was nominated the Worst Actor at the 27th Golden Raspberry Awards. Look, if you enjoy Larry and his comedy, then good for you. As for myself, the toilet humor and innuendos are needless filler just to get a cheap laugh. I think it true and wise in keeping your health by staying far away from this film of which fails on all accounts to pass inspection."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not a die hard fan of \"redneck humor\". I am a fan of Larry the Cable Guy's stand up, but this film wasn't near the best of LTGC. He's a funny and amusing comedian who is probably, next to Foxworthy, the best on The Blue Comedy Comedy team. His humor in this movie is every fart joke he ever wrote in his life times ten. Toilet humor only goes so far. This movie proves that one full movie can focus on farting, pooping, peeing, and anything you giggled at, and maybe still do now, in grade school. Health Inspector deserves an award for that.\n\nHealth Inspector could be compared to the film Chairman of the Board with Carrot Top. Both were the acting debut of two actors, and it will likely be the last thing they do (or git-r-done) ever again. Witless Protection may be a Larry the Cable Guy film, but it's not an improvement or much better than this. Much like Chairman, this is okay, but nothing memorable or anything that will go very far. Chairman came out in 1998, and that's long forgotten. Health Inspector came out in 2006, and that one is long forgotten too. I can understand twelve years late, but only four years late, and there's no word on it any more? The plot is Larry (Larry the Cable Guy) is a the disgusting (pun intended) local health inspector which raises question, it never says how he got to become a health inspector? How would they let a man like this judge food when I'm sure he hasn't ate anywhere besides McDonalds until he became a health inspector? Just a random observation. Larry works with Amy Butlin (Bahr) who is probably Larry's worst choice for a partner. Unlike him. she's very uptight and serious, but opposites do attract. They wind up trying to find out who is responsible for all the food poisonings at four star restaurants, an it's all down hill from there.\n\nLarry works best when he does his stand-up comedy. My favorite of his stand-up routines is probably Morning Constitutions out of all three of his works. I did see both Blue Collar Comedy Tour films and did saw episodes of Blue Collar TV. Larry was the highlight of both, but so much redneck and country humor baffles me and leaves me speechless more often than not.\n\nHealth Inspector I give credit to being a film with loads of toilet humor that will make fellow southerners laugh, but the market for these types of films are very limited, if they even exist. It's not a bad film by any means, but isn't the kind of film I can recommend for a regular movie goer. I did laugh a few times, but forgot what I laughed at or why about five minutes later. By the last half an hour I contemplated changing the channel. But followed through with my plan to watch it. Do I regret it? Well Super Size Me was on so a little.\n\nStarring: Larry the Cable Guy, Iris Bahr, Bruce Bruce, Joanna Cassidy, Brooke Dillman, Tony Hale, David Koechner, Lisa Lampanelli, and Megyn Price. Directed by: Trent Cooper."

If your idea of a comedy is watching fat men take watery-sounding craps on small toilets, seeing close up shots of peeing in showers, people vomiting violently on restaurant parking lots, and hairy man cracks, then yes, I agree, this is the funniest movie ever made. Yes, I know what you're asking yourself, and the answer is yes: it's worse than BORAT. Yes, BORAT. If you thought nothing could more disgusting than Borat, you haven't seen anything yet. Second, a comedy is supposed to make me laugh because it's laughably funny, not because it's laughably BAD. The storyline is terrible and the acting is a joke.

It is the first time I have ever turned off a movie simply because it was that bad of a movie. I made it through other such notable movies: \"Jackass: The Movie,\" \"Gigli,\" \"Date Movie,\" and the \"Scary Movie\" series without turning off the television in disgust. I tried turning it back on and watching it and it only got worse. At no point does it redeem itself!\n\nTake my advice. Save your money on this movie. See if the video store has \"White Coats\" or \"The Matador\" for some good off beat humor. Don't lower yourself to such a level. Maybe if people don't rent or buy it, \"movies\" like this will stop being made!"

But more \"Freddy Got Fingered\" horrible, not \"From Justin to Kelly\" horrible.\n\nThe good: The plot is there, and is easy to follow. It's not one of those movies where you keep asking yourself \"why did that happen?\" The jokes are funny in a low-brow way (VERY low-brow). Heck the first 5 minutes sets the pace for the whole movie, from Larry's butt crack to the \"yellow river\" in the shower (kids, say NO to \"crack\"). :) The comedy is so horrifically stupid it's entertaining (hence my reference to Freddy Got Fingered).\n\nThe bad: Everything else! Just about every race, gender, handicap, body size, and anything else commonly discriminated against is humorously referenced in this film! Nothing is sacred. If you're easily offended by....heck anything...don't watch!\n\nBottom line: If you switch your brain off...way off...you should be mind-numbingly entertained for 90 minutes. Just don't take anything too seriously.\n\nFinal verdict 3/10 (or one star out of four)."

When I heard Larry's name and the tittle I was expecting to see some stand up routines of his. Not some silly off the wall movie line, plot, characters. Of course that is what happens when a person buys according to \"brand names\" rather than merchandise content. I do not think this will do very much to boost his career. I will say the vehicle he drove in this movie would be what a person would expect of the good ole boy character his choice of costume portrays. A good ole boy down on the farm type of vehicle. There was some laughs there and I was able to chuckle at some of the lines in the movie. Iris Bahr his straight man side kick partner done her part to make the movie with her acting ability. The next time they put Larry in a movie it needs to be tittled Git-R-Done with stand up tid-bits of getting some dumb things done and leave him to the snip it comments of his usual style. Now all I have to say is Get It Done."

Where do I start? The acting was terrible.\n\nThe story predictable, anyone who couldn't figure out within 10 minutes of the title sequence that the wheelchair guy was involved is probably the kind of person that gave this movie more than 1 star.\n\nYeah, right, a total loser like Larry gets a girl with all her teeth and less than 300lbs...Only in Hollywood, only in Hollywood.\n\nLarry needs to stay on the Blue Collar Comedy tour where he can hide behind the other talented comedians and throw out an amusing one liner once in a while....that way no one has to fund another escapade like this again!

Low-brow humor is OK with me, but this movie is just low-brow.. there isn't any humor. If you're the curious type, and want to see if this film is really as bad as people are saying... go ahead and cough up $2.50 for an overnight DVD rental. But trust me, my friends... you won't want to see it again so save the $19.95 (the purchase-price of the DVD on 8-11-06) and don't actually buy this on DVD. It should be in the $7.99 bargain bin within a month or two, but even $7.99 would be a waste of your money. I understand why Larry The Cable Guy agreed to star in this film, and it isn't exactly loaded with Academy-Award winners, but I really wonder what Thomas F. Wilson (better known as Biff in \"Back To The Future\") was thinking when he signed on. It must be the manure thing....."

I have nothing against Larry the Cable Guy and I've found his performances on the Blue Collar Comedy Tours hilarious, but this movie was by nowhere near hilarious. It will have you thinking twice before ever eating in a restaurant for the rest of your natural life (you may not want to eat snacks while watching this movie, or depending on your stomach, before this movie). The movie focuses on Larry the Cable Guy who is no longer \"the Cable Guy\" but now a quasi-rogue health inspector. According to different plot summaries of the movie, Larry has to try to solve a mystery involving a chain of food poisonings, but what they fail to mention is that these food poisonings do not, as I suspected, cause death but instead cause diarrhea and horrible gas. Larry does deliver a few funny one-liners, but toilet humor is everywhere and distracts from anything that might come off as funny anywhere else. The movie's jokes may be considered offensive to many different types of people including, but not limited to the crippled, Indians, the mentally challenged, homosexuals, and even anyone that has only one eyebrow (some may even claim that it is insulting to African Americans and Caucasians depending on how you take a few jokes). This movie is not funny, but is so rude and disgusting that it is beyond description and can be only compared to \"The Fly\". The problem with this movie is not that it is ignorant (different characters make comments on how rude and disgusting Larry is), but that it was produced/directed/created by an individual with a very twisted sense of humor. The movie's plot makes sense (although I wish it didn't) and if you find gross-out humor funny, you could find this movie being a 2/10. If you don't vaguely like the gross and disgusting side of humor, avoid this movie like the plague because dead flies, rats, cockroaches, trash-filled trucks, and cases of horrible gas are shown frequently in the movie. If you want to see it, wait until it comes to television."

Larry's boss, Bart Tatlock (Tom Wilson), irritated with complaints against Larry and the department, assigns Larry a new partner, Amy Butlin (Iris Bahr), a by-the-book professional who takes the job seriously. She tries to learn the ropes of health inspection while putting up with Larry and his personality while investigating a rash of poisonings at high end restaurants.\n\nReleased in 2006 to negative reviews and poor box office, Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector was an experiment in capitalizing on the success of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour which from 2000 to 2006 had seen massive success in direct to video productions, concerts, and other merchandise. Initially destined for a direct-to-video release Paramount opted for a theatrical release before transferring the rights to Lionsgate. The movie didn't wow with critics or the box office and rightly so because it is not good.\n\nWhen the film opens with a full shot of Larry the Cable Guy's plumber's crack and takes us through his morning routine of stepping on discarded pizza, saving used q-tips, and pissing in the shower, it's clear the movie isn't aiming very high. The schtick on display doesn't get much better once he steps outside his hovel with embarrassing gags like David Koechner playing a man with special needs or Larry repeatedly thinking Amy Butlin is a man and spouting a bunch of tired gay panic jokes with no real build up, set up or pay off and just limply hang there. There's really nothing else to say about this film, it's a movie, it's in color, the sound mixing is well done so you and hear and see everything clearly. Even if you like Larry the Cable Guy's stand-up you're probably not going to like this movie. Most of the time it's just a series of gross out jokes that are tired and played out and no real substance or reason to exist."

I expect bad reviews from critics, I expect bad reviews from those who despise Larry the Cable Guy--but I don't expect bad reviews from fans of Larry. Even most of the people who enjoy his comedy didn't like the film. But I finally picked up the DVD and lo and behold, I was laughing...a lot. The plot is no gem, but that didn't bother me. This wasn't meant to be an intelligent, plot-driven comedy. It was meant to be a comedy vehicle for Larry, and as that, it succeeds. Sure, the humor is low-brow and there are plenty of toilet gags. What the hell do you expect? Have you ever seen Larry's stand-up? I can't deny that I wasn't laughing out loud when Larry was on the John, couldn't find any toilet paper, and uses a towel to wipe himself. And as I hoped, the movie contains plenty of the comedians hilarious one-liners. So if you're not a fan, stay away! Nobody's forced you to watch the damn movie! If you, like me, are a fan--then enjoy the show. The movie is not pretentious. It doesn't try to be anything more than a brainless comedy flick. I was feeling in a terrible mood when I watched the movie, and it definitely cheered me up. I'm sorry, but if I'm in a bad mood, I'd much rather watch \"Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector\" than \"Gone with the Wind.\" The actors all seem to be having fun, even veteran character Joe Pantoliano (who bares a striking resemblance to Clint Howard in the film). The lead actress is cute, there are several cool songs in the soundtrack (including \"I Want to Know What Love Is\" by Foreigner). I have very few complaints. Whether they admit it or not, every person at least sporadically craves to just check their brains at the door, kick back with a couple beers, and watch a low-brow comedy of this nature. I appreciate great films like \"Crash\" or \"American Beauty\" or \"Goodfellas.\" Just because I can enjoy a movie of this sort doesn't make me a Neanderthal."

It WAS silly , but everyone in the theater was laughing and there were a lot of people almost a full house so it wasn't just me. It made me laugh. It is just a fun silly movie to go see. Not very much cussing at all and no bad scenes so just cause there were no sex or violence its a bad movie? It had gross scenes I guess but they were even funny. ANd I am a girly type of movie watcher. ANyways if you want to laugh till you cry watch this movie."

Obviously if you've ever listed to Larry the Cable Guy's comedy, he makes plenty of fart jokes and isn't afraid of the tasteless. The movie is pretty much more of the same. It had decent characters and even though the plot wasn't Academy Award winning, it was more than what I expected.\n\nBottom line, if you didn't like Larry the Cable Guy before this movie, you probably won't like him after watching it. If you think redneck jokes are funny, you'll enjoy it. If you're one of those people who are easily offended or overly political correct, you might as well not bother."

Even though many complain that all the characters are cardboard cutouts of cop movies, I think this is intentional. I believe that this movie is meant more of a parody of buddy cop comedies than anything else.\n\nLarry is pretty funny, though I think he works better at stand-up comedy because he doesn't have any limitations of plot. The rest of the cast was pretty good, especially Butlin (the boy.) The movie had a bit of odd social commentary. It seemed as though Larry had some anti-racist beliefs. He would let health inspections slide more for those who had not been in the U.S. as long, and Big Shug (a black man with great fried chicken... I guess that's stereotype) was somewhat of the hero.\n\nThe movie actually had a few tense scenes. It doesn't deserve to be in the Bottom 100."

Sure, the storyline was kind of weak, and some of the supporting cast was bad too, it was still a nice fun romp of a movie. Larry's jokes were also fun to listen to, and I absolutely enjoyed his Larrymobile(truck).

But, as others have noted, you HAVE to be a fan of Larry to get it. If you've never seen/heard him perform, then a lot of the one liners might seem very offensive. As in his act, he plays a naive \"redneck\" who is unintentionally insulting, and I, for one, find it to be rather funny. Yes, there is a good bit of bathroom humor, but, unlike some of the opinions, I don't think it was overly done, and I also thought the acting was rather good. I imagine the crew had a lot of fun making this movie, and that comes through the performances. I'm a middle-aged family man of normal intelligence, have pretty eclectic tastes regarding art, and don't follow NASCAR, and this movie made me laugh. I've seen some movies that have garnered some pretty good ratings on this site that I thought didn't deserve them, and I've seen others with terrible ratings that didn't deserve those either. This movie should rate no lower than a five. I don't know what people were expecting when they saw it, but take it for what it is, and you'll find yourself entertained."

I can see reviews from people disappointed that this isn't a stand up act and I must stress that this is more of a rush-hour style movie with chemistry developing between the characters and larry as the protagonist. Once you understand this its a nice family movie. You can tell everyone making the movie is having a hilarious time and it pushes through the screen."

After all, is it not the basis of life, to worry about such troubling issues as to hang out with Kid Rock, or slobber over Pamela Anderson Lee whatever her last name is this year? Layer upon layer of intricate meaning, tackling other bothersome societal ills such as inbreeding, juvenile delinquent behavior well into adulthood, and even the perennial question \"Who farted?\". Indeed. Well thought out, Larry the Cable guy. You truly are a deep observer of humanity."

        "review_detailed_main": "This probably has the worst screenplay of any movie ever made. Worse than THE PIANO, even worse than THE English PATIENT. The direction is uninspired so the supporting cast (who are probably very capable) didn't do their best, and it's photographed like a sitcom with flat lighting in the interiors.\n\nBut it's got Larry, and that made it worth the $5.50 any day.\n\nPlus, it's encouraging that this was at least made in the United States, in Orlando, Florida and at the Universal Studios there. It seems like half the movies showing now are made in Canada with American money.\n\nPeople have a delusion that what works on the live stage or in a thirty minute TV show is going to make a great movie. Not necessarily. If HEALTH INSPECTOR were a series, this would be one thirty minute episode. With titles and ads that would be about twenty-two minutes of show. This is four times that long (plus a minute) and it moves as slowly as a glacier. And the plot (something about a cookoff to see who's the best chef in the city) is way more complicated than need be.\n\nLarry has created a wonderful character, and I'd like to see him try another movie with a real director and real writers. It could be dynamite.\n\nHe plays a modern day Will Rogers who (between farts) dispenses folksy wisdom. The screenplay brings on a string of bureaucrats, self important politicians and snobs for him to shoot down with his easygoing humor. Unfortunately, mere seconds into the film we see a closeup of Larry's buttcrack showing above his boxers. This is an indicator of what's to come.\n\nHe's teamed up with Amy, a new, by-the-book rookie health inspector. Thank goodness there's no attempt to start a romance with her and Larry (though much of the film he thinks Amy's a gay man, an illusion she disabuses him of in a hilarious scene involving a hidden microphone), but she's lucky in one respect. If she'd partnered with Clint Eastwood in a DIRTY HARRY movie her character would have been dead three fourths of the way through the story.\n\nLarry deserves another movie. I'm looking forward to it.\n\nFart jokes can be funny. There's a scene in a fancy restaurant with two yuppies on a romantic date that turns into a symphony of farts, but that can only get you so much mileage out of that.\n\nBetter luck next time, Larry."

Although it is a comedy most people overlook the tender romance between Larry & Jane. Of course in real life no girl would ever give their phone number to Larry. But in the movies unusual things can happen. Jane's mother is played by Lisa Lampanelli. I didn't recognize her at first. It was only after repeated viewings it dawned on me. Hey that's the chick who hosts those celebrity roasts! My favorite scene is the one with the rats. The pairing of Larry and Butlin is inspired. Why doesn't Bruce Bruce get more work. He's a natural. Unfortunately as Larry gets bigger & bigger he may loose some of the innocence of his early work. I hope not. I hope he never goes legitimate."

I went in with an open mind, but still thinking \"what can you really expect from a movie starring Larry the Cable Guy?\" It was very funny and I was surprised that the plot, albeit predictable, was very entertaining! Larry's genuine hillbilly sweetness makes everyone fall in love with him. Pretty good acting abilities for a someone who I thought was just a comedian! The entire (packed) movie theater was laughing from the opening scene to the closing outtakes. I recommend this movie if you want an easy watch and a good time at the movies."

I think this age really applies to this movie. If you kids are younger don't take them. I see a lot of movies but I can say I have never ever laughed so hard at any movie in my whole life. I was wiping the tears from my face for hours. The whole movie is funny. Its not just the preview parts you see on TV. I would see this everyday until its not playing anymore if I could. I am truly going to buy this when it comes out on DVD. You will not waste any money on this one. Have fun and enjoy!"

I laughed so much that my stomach and cheeks hurt. If people watch the blue collar comedy tour they know that Larry speaks a lot about gas and \"redneck\" things, so exactly what were they expecting out of the movie? Roses?

This is probably one of the worst films of the year, but it's a refreshing change to the seamlessly endless trend of re-makes and sequels. This is anything but a romantic comedy and probably a poor choice for taking a date to. Don't go see this movie if you feel the need for intellectual stimulation because there is nothing intellectual about it. This movie is a tribute to the term \"lack of sophistication.\" The movie left me laughing out loud, while shaking my head in disbelieve. This is generally not my kind of movie, but I gave it a rating of \"7\" because I found it entertaining and, even though I'm ashamed to admit it, it made me laugh. Do go see this movie if you are not offended by offensive humor."

There's a very funny bathroom scene, among other things. Larry is a wonderful comedian, and my sides hurt from laughing so hard at several points during the movie.\n\nIn this film, Larry is a city health inspector, and he lives in a junky house in this film. He has a neighbor who is a retard. One thing that I found refreshing was that this film was sort an of anti-Brokeback Mountain. With homosexuality being glorified everywhere you go, it's refreshing to see a movie where it is put in its place. Because of general hilariousness, and because of Larry's position on the issue I mentioned above, I will make a point of seeing any future movies he makes, on opening weekend. With all the trash that's come out of Hollywood lately, it's nice to have a movie that's actually worth the price of a ticket."

It's about this silly health inspector who has a new partner that's not all that beautiful. Then he is infatuated with this girl at the panty store. Then there is something in the food that makes everyone puke and all. It's something you may not want to eat and watch at the same time. But rent for some good laughs. Git-R-Done."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, I must say that I'm disappointed in many of the posts I've seen here regarding Larry The Cable Guy. People who make it their life-long dreams to insult Larry at all costs are just those people who are too uptight to giggle a little. Really, his humor is just immature, which I find funny because it reminds me of the jokes my friends and I used to laugh about in junior high and high school. Many people still find that type of humor funny. For instance, \"Man, I don't know what I ate, but I could sh** through a screen door and not touch a single wire!\" Tell me that's not funny. It is crude, but still rates a good belly-laugh.\n\nSo, why do people not like Larry? It's not because of the humor, it is because they don't like Larry's politics AND his method of speaking his mind. Why is it if a liberal tells jokes and speaks his/her mind it's hilarious and if a conservative tells jokes and speaks his/her mind, it's not funny- it's bigoted and racist? It's not the jokes. In my opinion, it's the attitude of the listener. For example, how many people who comment negatively on this movie have actually seen it? If we took a survey, I would venture to guess that a majority of people who did comment negatively have never seen it! And why is that? It's because they have been polluted by every liberal media outlet across the globe and whatever anybody who thinks differently than a liberal is automatically a racist and a bigot.\n\nFurthermore, those individuals who seek out to insult redneck humor just don't get the culture. But again, I really don't expect them to. They accuse us of being close-minded and freedom of speech for them is only a one-way street. They can say whatever they want (no matter how absurd it is) and if a conservative speaks out, then it's bad and we're suddenly the worst evil scum in the world.\n\nSo here's a message to \"those\" people: if you haven't seen the movie, you really shouldn't be voting on it. That's like asking a retard to go beat up Jackie Chan! It doesn't make sense to go do something like that. Would you wipe before you poop? NO!"

Larry's character is endearing, and his antics in the world of health inspections are nothing short of side-splitting. The supporting cast adds to the comedic charm, making it a perfect ensemble. If you're in need of a good laugh and appreciate Larry's brand of comedy, this movie is a solid 10 out of 10, and a must-watch for anyone looking for pure, unadulterated fun!\n\nI Cole Swier personally guarantee you will love this movie."
