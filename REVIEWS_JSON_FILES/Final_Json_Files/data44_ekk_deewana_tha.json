Also the fantastic music.\n\nBut the Hindi version might have lost something in translation. I watched it but its not a bad movie. I agree that the supporting cast has done a better job than the new hero-heroine. And the ending makes all the twists and turns pointless. But I guess Gautam menon was not sure if the Hindi audience would accept the same Tamil ending. I hope that someone who has fallen in love with a girl and lost her would be able to relate to the story. For the same reason, I urge all to watch the director's cut version with the alternate ending.\n\nBut still the movie is not as bad like the critics have reviewed. The whole point of the movie is that this is a story about a 22 year old boy who is acting like a 19 year and a girl who is confused and prefer to suffer than go against her parents. Don't expect super melodrama or cheap comedy or item numbers. I have lost count of friends who have told its their story.\n\nI give 7 stars because of the dialogs, music, camera, good performances by support cast."

        "review_title": "It doesn't offer anything new but isn't that bad at all as rated in the review market.",
        "review_detailed_main": "The latest offering from Bollywood once again reveals the dark side of today's \"Review Market\" prevailing in the Industry. Where last week's EK MAIN AUR EKK TU didn't really deserved the 3-4 stars ratings given by many, the current week's EKK DEEWANA THA also doesn't deserve the 1-2 star ratings by most of the critics, stating it as a very poor film. So there is evidently a huge imbalance in the reviews which largely get influenced by the production house and stars in the film instead of the product's actual content.\n\nComing to EKK DEEWANA THA, it certainly isn't any great piece of art or path-breaking film with some fresh ideas. It talks about the same ages old love story between two young souls, who not only have a slight age difference but they also come from two extremely diverse regional & religion backgrounds causing all the problems. The script can easily be called predictable as we have already seen the same emotional drama umpteen times before on the screen. But still EDT isn't a complete washout as being written in many reputed reviews. It's a sweet film with a refreshing first half which keeps you engaged and entertained till the interval. Plus it also has its moments post intermission resulting in an above average film far better than many craps churned out by some big production houses in the name of Love Stories.\n\nFollowing the current remake trend EKK DEEWANA THA is the Hindi version of director Gautham Menon's earlier 2 hits namely VINNAITHAANDI VARUVAAYAA (Tamil) and YE MAAYA CHESAVE (Telugu). In the initial reels it even reminds you of Kamal Hassan-Rati Agnihotri starrer EK DUJE KE LIYE which also revolved around a love affair in some similar circumstances. But as it progresses it moves on to a different path involving an interesting marriage sequence and its loving results. So what's watchable in this routine love-saga? The answer comes in the form of Amy Jackson, Manu Rishi and to a certain extent Prateik too.\n\nHowever the sole charmer in the film remains Amy who looks stunningly gorgeous especially in the Indian outfits. Though she doesn't get a well defined character (who remains confused) along with a poor make-up in many scenes, still she keeps the viewer hooked on to her innocent beauty till the end and acts well. The second reason why EDT rises above a routine love story is Manu Rishi, who holds the film together with his natural style and entertaining one liners particularly in the first half. But if only he had something more to do in the script, it would have resulted in a much finer product for the audience.\n\nPrateik manages to impress in his casual approach towards the role but the boy seriously needs to work harder on his dance and emotional scenes. At times both his body language and dialogue delivery goes in an awkward zone which hampers the impact of his otherwise fine performance. In the supporting cast Sachin Khedekar performs the best as Prateik's friendly father.\n\nApart from the actors it's the Cinematography (taking you on to a Kerala tour) and few songs by A. R. Rahman which raise the standard of this routine love story. Yet the maestro isn't in his full form in the movie as he once again gives a soundtrack below expectations with traces of \"Kabhi Kabhi Aditi\" (Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na) in his \"Hosanna\"\".\n\nActually EDT is a fine film till the intermission and it doesn't disappoint the viewer despite of having a routine storyline mainly due to its fresh pair and Manu. In fact this is the reason why Love Stories have always been there in every decade featuring two unknown faces since they can easily make an instant connection with the public and can deliver a Hit.\n\nBut EDT is not able to reach that crescendo due to its pretty weak second half and a prolonged climax which eventually ends on an \"All is Well\" note unexpectedly. It would have been a different film altogether if it had a more realistic climax where there was no re-union of the lovers but they still remained friends living their separate lives in two different parts of the world.\n\nThe writers falter in a big way as they are not able to define the character of the girl in a justified manner. Yes a girl in love remains always in a dilemma to choose between her boyfriend and her parents. But the writers here give no proper justification for their parting away from each other all of a sudden. Moreover it all starts dragging in the last 30 minutes without any purpose, which fails to leave any kind of loving impact on the viewers.\n\nIn my opinion the love-affair in the film should have ended right there in the Taj Mahal corridors showing a married Amy saying good bye to Prateik and the film should have ended with everyone praising the directorial venture of Pratiek being loudly cheered by Manu Rishi standing along with him in the theater. That would have been a more ideal and realistic ending of a tragic love story as I see it.\n\nAnyhow, in its present version EKK DEEWANA THA is a sweet film with a fine first half and a beautiful Amy which surely can be watched once without any doubt. So if you are really interested in love stories, then please forget all the negative reviews you might have read about the movie as it certainly isn't that bad at all as being projected in those well publicized write-ups."

So, this Hindi version is the 3rd version or 2nd remake of the original one.\n\nNowadays, a lot of Hindi movies are being remaked from Tamil originals. And, people who follows Tamil movies believes that Tamil movies are big time ahead of Hindi Cinema. So, we see a lot of frustration from those audiences who watched either of the two early versions of Ekk Deewana Tha!\n\nHowever, I will recommend to those who loves romantic bollywood films and hadn't seen any of those early two versions, should watch. I really loved the movie, though it have some technical issues. Pratiek Babbar did a really nice job with the leading role of Sachin, a wanna be film maker who makes himself a successful one at the end of the story. He falls in love with his neighbor Jassi and chases his love with the struggle of being a filmmaker. The movie has lots of good music by A R Rahman. Amy Jackson played the role of Jassi and did an OK job with her Bollywood debut. She is a stunning British beauty and its really a treat watching her on screen! Kerala is another beauty of the film with some lovely cinematography.\n\nDirector Gautham Menon did his job handsomely keeping a good slow pace without any monotonous pause till the end. Overall a good 7/10 romantic bollywood film with some good cinematography and music!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Ek Deewana Tha\n\nThere is nothing to make you fall for this one!....if you are not already tired of watching boring big Bollywood cinema, you would certainly be after this one... Not to be too cynical about the movie, but it doesn't really live up to its make! In fact why did they remake this movie at all? And if it was hit in Tamil and Telugu, it would have surely better written dialogues.\n\nThe script - is by far the most annoying! Not only does it not have any coherence, the story is also story less. There are other films which do not have a story ( Chalo Dilli), but have had better outcomes in terms of the dialogues and the direction. But this one fails in all counts. The boy falls in love with just one look, and chases the girl. She being Christian and a Malayalee, the boy ( a Hindu, from Mumbai) chases her to Allepy and witnesses her rejecting her marriage. The idea behind it was that she had something towards the boy, which she couldn't express. Finally the expression comes, and this is the part which is the most 'not thought' after. There could have been better dialogues at least. The effect of a Bollywood 'romanc-a-tainer' is just not there in this one.\n\nThe Actors - are as fresh as new college students needed training. They sure light up the space, cause there is nothing else to the movie that keeps me tied to it. Pratiek has done reasonably well, and given that he is starting his career is worth the shot. Moreover, fresh faces are welcome. But fresh faces just for namesake are where the movie again fails. Amy is not at all a 'Malayalee'. She was searching for expressions the entire movie. This was not a movie where her charms would work through her super model figure! This needed expressions, and dialogue delivery. The role of Manu Rishi was refreshing and was the only well-tailored character.\n\nThe direction - Barring the scenery in God's own Country, the film has little directorial skills to offer. A director's vision is something which comes out of the movie. Rather than aping the previous movies, if he would have added something which has a better context, it would have been better. If on the other hand he was not interested to change it, he could have still checked whether it is still coherent and the story flows! Alas, nothing was done, and nothing came out! For me the film has no other layers to figure out. The story could have made better sense, and had the intentions of bringing out a familial aspect to love stories, but it never reached its own aspirations. We would have to wait for 2 states adaptation for this issue to be re- screened again! Lets hope they treat it well next time.\n\nWatch More movies for now!...Don't give up so soon!"

Loved most of the songs and finally went and saw the movie 1st Day 1st Show. Unfortunately I was the only person in the movie theater. That was kinda odd but cool at the same time.\n\nThe 2hr 45min film's biggest flaw is it's slow pace. But it makes up for it thanks to the super awesome songs, Kerala has been shot wonderfully, Prateik Babbar's brilliant acting. I hope he becomes the industry's biggest star. Amy Jackson did really well considering she's a first timer and looked gorgeous. The story was beautiful as well.\n\nOn the whole I'm happy with the product. The film failed at the box office which is quite unfortunate. I hope Gautam Menon continues to direct Hindi movies in the future. If you haven't seen the Tamil / Telugu version, watch Ekk Deewana Tha. If you have seen the Tamil / Telugu version ... no comments."

Specially the scene on the park of Taj Mahal - deep down into it, Prateik have given it a real touch. Prateik danced wonderfully great, but Amy lacked in this part. Worth a watch."
