This film understands spider-man fans like no other spider-man film before it. Truly a celebration of the most beloved character in the best way possible!"

Starts off fun, safe and familiar and then becomes extremely emotional, satisfying and full of great callbacks. A love letter to all things Spider-Man.\n\nTom Holland gives an incredible lead performance once again, reliably charming and likeable but with a lot more emotional heft this time around. Zendaya and Jacob Batalon both have perfect chemistry with Holland and are also incredible in their own ways.\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch reaffirms why he's such a good Doctor Strange with his excellent dry wit and gravitas. All the returning villains give strong performances but Willem Dafoe is definitely the standout performance with an unsettling and terrifying presence.\n\nJon Watts' direction is superb, the action sequences are thrillingly acrobatic once again but refreshingly impactful this time around. There's a few homages to the styles of the previous iterations and some gorgeous imagery.\n\nIt's also perfectly paced with none of its roughly 2hr 30 minute runtime feeling dull or overly long due to a strong momentum established early on. The CG is extremely impressive with only a few weak spots.\n\nThe music by Michael Giacchino is fantastic, a nice balance of themes from the previous iterations and use of Holland's iconic motifs which are slightly altered in ways that work as well as a few new additions that are beautifully epic."

        "review_title": "A franchise in decline, and this meta nonsense doesn't help",
        "review_detailed_main": "I was already concerned about Spider-Man: No Way Home when I walked into the theater (one could say I was expecting to be disappointed.) I kind of hate the idea of delving too deep into a multiverse, because I think it muddles things too much, and defies the internal logic of most stories. Sure enough that was something I felt while watching this film. This movie cannot hold up to even the tiniest bit of analysis, because it creates plot holes that you can drive a freight train through. It's kind of sad because there were some moments in the movie that I genuinely loved, but all I can think about days later are the myriad of questions that I'm left with because this movie created so many situations that make no sense.\n\nMy other big problem with Spider-Man: No Way Home is not really a fault of the movie, but more of the society we live in today. Living in an internet-focused culture, we are bombarded by ads and news stories that relate to the things that interest us. SInce I've shown my love for all things MCU in the past, of course I see plenty of things crossing my radar about the upcoming films. I was able to avoid watching any trailers for this movie, which I thought would help, but by merely catching headlines of casting rumors I could foresee every surprise they built into it. Of course any logical mind could put two and two together once the guest appearances start, so I suppose this isn't a movie that is going to blow away audiences with its surprises.\n\nAs I said, though, my disappointment is quite frustrating because I also found many aspects of No Way Home so satisfying. They wrapped up some story elements nicely, and this might have contained some of the best acting in any Marvel movie. In particular, I found Zendaya so surprisingly strong, I was almost able to ignore her lack of character motivation in some key moments. She wasn't the only person in the film that behaved stupidly, in fact the central premise of the film is built on a horrible idea from Aunt May that seems altruistic, but lacks any 4th-dimensional thinking which I would expect from a genius like Peter Parker. But smart people being dumb is the catalyst of the entire story, as even Dr. Strange doesn't seem to think anything through, past Peter's initial request.\n\nNo Way Home is easily the most meta Spider-Man movie ever made, which is kind of shocking to say in a post \"Into the Spider-verse\" world. It's catering to the most die-hard fans in the world, but it's more of a nod to the fans of the Spider-Man movies. I was always a huge fan of the multitude of Spider-Man comic books when I was a collector, but I've typically struggled with his portrayal in films. So, giving all these nods to things that came before Tom Holland took over the role on the big screen, falls a bit flat for me. One of the things I loved about this iteration of the character is that it avoided the cliches and saved us so much of the traditional Spider-Man origin story, but this movie back-pedaled and became a copy of a copy of a copy.\n\nThis return to cliche also sucked some of the emotion out of key moments as any fan of the character should know the same old tropes by now. I almost got emotional at the end because of the great acting performances, but the big emotional moment earlier in the film did nothing for me as all I could think was \"really, we're going there?\" There are some good laughs in the film, although I wonder how well it will hold up on rewatch. And I will rewatch this film, as I do with all MCU movies, but I think at this point Spider-Man: No Way Home sits as my least favorite in the franchise. In fact, I'm at a point right now where I'm questioning if I will keep being a diehard fan of everything the MCU churns out. This film wasn't what I'd call a complete failure, but I'm concerned the MCU is getting closer to one of those. Perhaps EndGame should have been exactly what the title implies."

        "review_detailed_main": "Spider man has always been my favourite character, due to the nostalgia of reading the comic as a kid, or just the characters sheer brilliance. In the last two movies that Holland did as spider man, I was slightly disappointed because we only got to see a child who was constantly babied by Tony Stark. The Spider-Man who we watched in Homecoming and Far From Home hadn't really earned his place in my heart, with Holland's childish charm being over used and making the character of Peter Parker a boy who frankly doesn't live up to the standard set by his predecessors. In this movie however, not only did it give me a nerdgasm due to the fantastic ensemble cast, but I finally got to see Holland flex his acting muscles and show me whey he was cast in his role and why he has reached his levels of stardom.\n\nThis movie was brilliant. The emotional themes which were laced into he movie kept the plot moving, with Holland, Willem Dafoe and Marissa Tomei showing us why they were truly hired. Unlike previous Spidey movies like TASM and Far From Home, this one truly captured my attention and boasted the elements of Spidey that I love so much.\n\nI will admit that when going into the movie, I was very hesitant about them bringing back the old Spider Men and villains, because I believed that they were better left untouched, but after watching the movie, all of my negative thoughts were blown away. Each villain gets their own time to shine, each of them harness their old selves whilst also elevating their characteristics.\n\nToby and Andrew both come back, something which elicited screams of joy from everyone in the theatre. They were brilliant. Toby was calm but excited, mature but fun, wise but still held that social awkwardness that we all adored back in the day. Andrew in my opinion, was way better as Spidey in this movie than any of his own. There was a pure emotion behind Andrew's Spidey and we finally get to see why he was cast as Spidey. It worked. Having three socially awkward super powered nerds somehow worked.\n\nI won't lie when I say that this is by far my favourite Spidey movie of all time. There were so many tear jerker moments in the movie, with Tom Holland standing out in all of them. He finally showed me SPIDER-MAN in capital letters. His character's emotions were so believable due to the way in which he portrayed them. His character came across as human, as someone who makes mistakes and then seeks ways to fix it, in order to keep those who he loves safe.\n\nThe classic uncle Ben line gets dropped multiple times in this movie, finally making this 'Home' trilogy as Holland's Spidey's origin story in a sense. We see how the famous Uncle Ben quote truly makes an impact on Peter at the end, making us cry with tears of sadness but also pride.\n\nMy words cannot express how much I loved this movie. Especially that final scene."

        "review_detailed_main": "Instantly loathing the publicity of being outed by the press, Spider-Man hits up the Sanctum Sanctorum to ask Dr. Strange for some mystical assistance. They cast a spell of wiped memory and screw it up, reality is torn, familiar faces invade different spaces... you know this, you've seen the trailer. It's the Sony/MCU equivalent of X-Men: Days of Future Past, with a stream of old band members coming out of retirement for a jam-packed farewell concert.\n\nOne might hope that the results are a smidge better than that old X-Men reunion, and they are, but No Way Home also suffers from many of the same problems. Primarily, the overwhelming urge to stuff as much crap on the screen as possible, even when the audience is already exhausted. It tries to serve too many masters and, in the end, sufficiently serves none. There's fun to be had, especially when the oddball mix-and-match super-characters get the chance to escape the trappings of a broader storyline and simply converse as individuals. Those accessible human interactions have been a big strength for the two preceding Marvel Spider-Man flicks, and they reap great benefits here, each time the old guard mingles with the new.\n\nI wish we had more such moments, but the push to turn the MCU's most grounded franchise into another big-time tent pole attraction demands otherwise. In reaching for the next major event, they've overlooked the \"neighborhood\" part of \"Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man.\" Actually, they might've forgotten the \"friendly\" part, too, because there's a whole bunch of angst spinning around Tom Holland's central performance. But that's more excusable: Peter Parker goes through a lot over the course of this hundred-fifty minutes, he progresses and matures as a character, and he's experienced equally dark times in the comics.\n\nNo, the performances aren't the issue here, nor is the dialogue, which remains snappy and delightful. The primary culprit is the plot, bloating and careening in indeterminate (and often mindless) directions, making a lot of noise but not making a lot of sense. Dr. Strange hand-waves many explanations under the guise of mysticism, which is basically his thing, but so do the various Spider-Men. Important members of the supporting cast are marginalized and under-served. The city of New York, once an essential ingredient, is now barely a backdrop. Goalposts are moved, overshadowed, and then moved again. Rumor has it that script re-writes were still underway during filming, and it shows.\n\nThis is messy. Lots of fun on certain occasions, but stifling and sludgy in others. It's a mixed bag, leaning more to the positive than the negative, but I don't know that I'm content with the way everything wraps up in the end. Where Homecoming and Far From Home both left me charged and anxious for the next step, No Way Home put me in a place of quiet acceptance. Feels like the franchise has aged, and that's not a great thing."

I loved the recall of old villains, it was great to see Foxx, Molina and Dafoe come back again and it's clear they're having fun. Cumberbatch is good in a limited role too. Best of all are Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire, who light up the screen and make all of their scenes delightful; they show up Holland, that's for sure. The rest is your usual mish mash of CGI action complete with an excruciatingly overblown and sentimental ending (please!)."

        "review_detailed_main": "Easily the most anticipated and theorised comic book film since Avengers: Endgame. Spider-Man: No Way Home is set directly after the end of Far From Home. With Spider-Man's (Tom Holland) identity now revealed, Peter asks Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for help. When the spell goes wrong, dangerous foes from other worlds start to appear.\n\nIt was always going to be difficult for this to live up to the myriad of potential expectations that had built up in mine and millions of others heads after the first trailer released back in August. Luckily throughout its duration No Way Home excels at fan pleasing moments and truly giving Peter monumental stakes and potential consequences. However it is undeniably overstuffed and choppy, as well as for me personally a lot of the MCU'isms not always particularly gelling well with the returning villains.\n\nI will be keeping the plot details vague, but for those who had expectations and ideas of what the film might be, it probably is pretty much what you expect. The opening act ripple effect of Peter's identity being revealed, with he, MJ and Ned being turned down by colleges and constant harassment sets the stage well and understandably Peter's desperation for Doctor Strange to fix it. From there the rogues gallery pour through and it's up to Peter to stop them.\n\nHere is where some of my favourite aspects of the film are, as well as my irritations. It's undeniably great seeing these characters return to the big screen, and throughout the second act it is uniquely executed and delivers some satisfying interactions between the foes (though some of their motivations could have been a bit more fleshed out), as well as time to breathe. However it is once again the abundance of joke attempts and alterations to a couple of the characters that just make some of the interactions feel awkward and cringe inducing.\n\nDoc Ock's bridge battle is a standout return and the choreography, sound design and score all intertwine nicely. Holland wasn't lying about this being a darker and more violent entry into the franchise, with the first Goblin brawl being the film's highlight, alongside the jaw-dropping visual spectacle of the mirror dimension duel. The final action set piece is pure spectacle and grin inducingly fun, it's just a shame that yet again it's another CGI heavy sequence set at night, so it's frequently hard to see what's going on at certain points.\n\nThis is probably Holland's best Spider-Man performance as he really has some emotional heavy lifting to do, as well as keeping the quips and enthusiasm fresh. Willem Dafoe absolutely steals the film. He's still got all of it: the grin, the laugh, the expressions and genuine menace. Molina as well, brilliantly capturing the commanding intelligence and personality of Doc Ock and Jamie Foxx is far better suited in this iteration of Electro. Benedict Cumberbatch adds a layer of bitterness and snark to Strange, yet keeps his core values and dedication to help in check.\n\nSpider-Man: No Way Home may just be the film many fans of dreamed of. Unfortunately for me, whilst it still delivered a lot of what I wanted, I can't help but feel a bit disappointed. Dafoe & Molina prove once again why Spider-Man 1 & 2 will never be topped, the increased personal stakes for Peter are welcome and I'm still partially in awe that the film actually happened. However the leering presence of now extremely familiar and annoying MCU traits and tropes, certain character interactions and an overstuffed storyline do hold it back."

Emotions. This was not only an action-packed movie but also a story-driven movie with fantastic execution. Tom Holland and Zendaya as well as other actors managed to deliver acting never seen in the Marvel universe before.\n\nNo Way Home captured that heart of the first couple of Spider-man trilogy which I think old fans will admire. Nevertheless, I believe this movie was fantastically done and little mistakes.\n\nNo Way Home is a great movie I highly recommend. Especially to the Marvel fans like me that had gotten bored of the new stuff."

And then, in a weird tonal shift, the movie gets really dark, and then tries to go back to the light-hearted bit with that hanging over it, and does some more really silly stuff, and some rather confused but fast-paced action, and then goes for a sad thing that I found kinda boring, and, well, what is this supposed to *be*.\n\nIt doesn't make much sense, it's tonally chaotic, and as with the previous film, the action is fleetfully enjoyable but entirely forgettable.\n\nStill, a reasonable amount of the humor works, it's fun to see the way they play with the multiverse, and there's definitely fun to be had. But I find it perplexing how many people love this movie because to me it's a mess. It should have just stuck with silly all the way through."

Unbelievably outstanding performances from everyone involved, especially Tom Holland, Zendaya, and Willem Dafoe.\n\nA heartfelt, nostalgic homage to the Spider-Man legacy that fans will rewatch countless times, laughing and crying along for many more years to come.\n\nA memorable, passionate, once-in-a-lifetime cinematic experience.\"\n\nRating: A."

Escape the crowd, escape the magician, run from vilains, fight the vilains, save the world.\n\nThe visual effects are great. The combat scenes takes the best of all spiderman movies and benefits from it. Camera angles and movements are excellent."

Ever since this movie's announcement, you knew this was a bigger deal than the usual superhero flicks. And being a movie with such high expectations, means that there's so much room for things to go wrong. And unfortunately... It seems like it did.\n\nNow I'm fresh out of the theatre, and I already feel like this movie had so much potential wasted. A sentiment I also share towards Avengers Endgame; where the only thing the writers seemed to worry about was 'fan-service'. Fan service is fine honestly, but the line should be when fan-service slowly starts taking over for storytelling. Because the storytelling in this movie was childish.\n\nDon't get me wrong... I enjoyed the movie... I enjoyed the theatre experience... It was fun... But fun is not enough when you realize what could have been. Spiderman: No Way Home could have been Marvel's most ambitious project yet, but it has the curse of Marvel's horrible writing staff who similarly messed up everything from Avengers Endgame, to WandaVision, to Falcon and the Winter Soldier, to Loki and to Black Widow. The plot of the movie sounds like some cheap fan fiction that somehow got made. And what's even worse is its absolutely cringe worthy dialogue; existing for the sole purpose of reminding the audience of previous Spiderman movies. It's such a dumb and convenient plot that just exists for the sake of nostalgia.\n\nI loved Avengers Infinity War and I really enjoyed Spiderman Far From Home, but I haven't enjoyed a single Marvel project since, because all their projects have been so shallow with no real substance to back itself up. Marvel has a writing problem that needs to be looked into, for the sake of cinema and storytelling.\n\nWhat a missed opportunity... What an absolutely missed opportunity..."

        "review_title": "An Epic Film That Really Delivers",
        "review_detailed_main": "Finally, the biggest film Spider-Man: No Way Home has hit cinemas and I had to go see it as early as possible. Now I have watched it, here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees Spider-Man's secret identity revealed, he tries to get Doctor Strange's help to fix things but this leads to some unwanted visitors from other universes to cause problems for both of them.\n\nMain Character Tom Holland has played Spider-Man for a while now and for me this is his best performance in the role. You really see how he has grown and this film shows real depth to the character and how he has kind of grown up into this crazy world. He doesn't have much rest in the film and it really pushes Holland to impress in the majority of his scenes and I thought he was great in really making Spider-Man a top hero in The MCU.\n\nSupporting Characters Zendaya plays MJ and I was just really happy to see the dynamic between her and Peter in this film. Despite everything that goes on they are a pretty strong couple and it is just nice for a comic book film to have a relationship that feels natural without overpowering the main plot. Benedict Cumberbatch reprises his role as Doctor Strange and he is really good, I really like how despite being a hero he has a more mature and different viewpoint to Spider-Man. He adds some really interesting parts to the film and plays a unique role in the progress of the story and Spider-Man as a character. Jacob Batalon is back as Ned and he is much better then the role he played in Far From Home. He is just a fun character that supports Peter, he is way more involved with Spider-Man and that improves his character so much. Marisa Tomei is back as Aunt May and again she is more involved this time out and is just a really great person for Holland to bounce off and the dynamic just really works and makes their relationship feel very real. Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina and Jamie Foxx reprise their roles as Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus and Electro. Dafoe and Molina are great and really flourish in their roles, but the surprise is Foxx as Max Dillon/Electro. He is so much better then he was in Amazing Spider-Man 2 and I am glad he got given this 2nd chance here.\n\nStory The story is really great, I was worried with all of the multiverse elements that the focus could have been taken off of a character arc for Spider-Man but it nails this element. Peter has a real arc and it develops incredibly well and for me was a real highlight. It is obviously great seeing the returning villains and they are treated with respect and their characters are further explored. The ending feels deserved and because you are so invested it feels really earnt.\n\nScript MCU films often get criticised for their scripts including too much humour in them, but I actually think the balance is really handled well here. Yes there are funny moments here but for me they didn't outweigh the serious and darker parts of the film.\n\nStyle The film looks great, the actions scenes are all really fun and seeing The MCU Spider-Man going against villains from the other franchises works very well and allows for some fun sequences. The pacing for the film is also really good, despite being 2 hours 30 mins it never felt too long and I honestly believe that there isn't really any filler here which is an impressive feat.\n\nOverall Overall, Spider-Man: No Way Home is an epic film that really lives up to the hype. I am possibly still buzzing because I have just watched the film but I can't find too much fault and this is a Spider-Man fans dream film and anybody will find this film plenty of fun.\n\nRating - 10/10."

I read another review that claimed that this is what cinemas were made for and I couldn't agree more , the variety of emotions shared amongst every man/woman/child were truly sensed through everyone's reactions in the cinema."

Those movies defined what it is to be Spider-Man. A few years and a few Spider-Man movies later, that bar the Raimi movies had set remained untouched. The amazing Spider-Man movies were great in their own ways but suffered from some plot issues and an unfinished story. The previous MCU Spider-Man movies were also great in their own ways, but I always felt like they lacked real consequences and stakes. Nothing could hit that mark like the Raimi movies did... that is, until I watched this movie. The action, the light hearted humor, the emotions, the consequences, the responsibility... all of what defines Spider-Man, is all here. I think I can safely say that this movie is the best Spider-Man movie. As a huge Spider-Man fan, this movie was everything I wanted it to be and is an absolute game changer. I went in with ridiculously high expectations after imagining all the wild possibilities in my head before watching it. My expectations were exceeded and I could not be happier with what we got from this movie. It is the best Spider-Man movie. This movie bring much closure to many things and stories set up from previous films while setting up numerous possibilities for future installments and I cannot wait to see what the future will bring."

        "review_title": "An Awesome Mess",
        "review_detailed_main": "I really don't like the MCU very much, but I love Spiderman wholeheartedly. I watched this movie 5 times in theaters, imagine my hype level at this movie's reveals.\n\nBut my hype didn't stop me from seeing this movie's glaring problems.\n\nAs many have mentioned before, the events that set the story in to motion are ridiculous. Even I know that Dr. Strange is acting strongly irrational and impulsive. And then he has the gull to blame Peter, even though Strange is jumping in to a spell without explaining its effects on Peter's life. This is actually an unacceptable level of writing.\n\nNot only that, but they messed up most of the big cameos in this movie.\n\nFirst off, Jamie Fox's Electro is just a straight up a different character. I think Fox's ego might've gotten in the way of the writing because he is literally the same character he played in Baby Driver. What happened to the sensible and insecure Max from TASM 2? He is also not blue anymore, andq he doesn't even mention the fact. That being said, his character does get a few intentional laughs.\n\nFlint Marko and Dr. Connors were just there, so they can tease and not deliver the Sinister Six. The actors weren't even on set. They could've easily been cut from the movie and nothing would be lost. They also don't explain why Flint Marko stays in sand form the entire time. It's really weird and distracting because he never did that in Spiderman 3.\n\nDr. Octavius was alright, even if he did seem a little more whiny than usual. And they pull a weird fake out scene with him where he just runs off for no good reason except that it's convenient for the plot.\n\nNorman Osborne was great, except that he is freakishly strong compared to the first Spiderman movie. Maybe Tom Hollands Spiderman is just a lot weaker than Toby's.\n\nIf they had Electro acting like Electro, and given Dr. Octavius a bit more of a motive for the mentioned scene, we could've had a nice 3v3 setting without the nonsense Connors and Marko brought with them.\n\nOn the flip side, I love what they did with Andrew's Peter Parker. He alone had two scenes that made me teary-eyed.\n\nThey also did a great job with MJ. She was less snarky and quirky and more supporting and vulnerable. I actually really enjoy her character now.\n\nToms Peter got some very strong emotional moments as well, and I like that they essentially fixed every common complaint people had about his character.\n\nOne more thing I have to get off my chest is that the CGI in this movie is horrendous. Pretty much all the most important scenes in this movie look distractingly terrible. From Andrew's reveal to his key scene with MJ. My first time seeing the movie, I honestly wondered if that is Spiderman from a animated universe until he took off his mask.\n\nThe entire end battle looks terrible as well. The color scheme for that fight is just dark browns and greens. It's as if they were trying to hide the terrible CGI. Unfortunately, that results in there being very few actual frames where we can see the Spidermen in action. Just from the memes I've seen about the movie where people are trying to create templates, it seems there are very few shots that can even work as pictures because it's very dark and is usually blurred by motion.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the movie is great, but it easily could've been a 10/10 movie for me. That's why it's so infuriating to see them blunder all this potential. I don't know if it was studio interference, but a lot of baffling creative decision keep this movie from being a masterpiece for Spidey fans."

This movie is packed with each and every element, a roller coaster of emotions. In these 2.5 hours you'll laugh, cry and scream. Overall, This movie ended up being way above my expectations.. I was really waiting for some good old marvel movie after Avengers-endgame but this one is just something else. If you are a Spiderman/marvel fav go and watch this as soon as you can."

I advise to read the review of the film not just one, but from several film experts. Because this series turned out to be controversial for many experts.

        "review_title": "The Ultimate Fan Service Movie",
        "review_detailed_main": "While this third movie in the latest trilogy of Spiderman films will more than placate the fanboys and fangirls out there, it is at a cost. This movie could have easily clocked in at two hours and feel like the perfect blockbuster movie. But no. After the finale, the \"good byes\" stretch on and on. Then of course there is baiting for other upcoming MCU movies. Even the fun jokey jokey scenes that are the hallmark of this franchise get cringe-worthy sometimes. I still give this movie a thumbs up, because it took a concept and found some fun with it. There is a little bit of manipulation, with more than a few tear jerker scenes (really? How many times do you need to push the waterworks?). But the biggest thing this movie has going for it is re-thinking the villains. Instead of the villains arriving and being bad guys, we find a way to make them sympathetic, and the audience will go along with the alternate storyline.\n\nI also like Benedict Cumberbatch. He fares well as a secondary character that only appears in the movie every once in a while. At the heart of the success of this current iteration of the Spiderman franchise is the friendship, particularly MJ and Ned. They stay integral to the center of the story quite intentionally, so you feel this is more of an ensemble piece that the previous two movies. However, the expected fan service (rumors are true) takes over and becomes the twist in the story. The concept of multiple universes has been pushed by Marvel for the last couple years, and here it is used as a vehicle for conflicts that arise.\n\nSo I enjoyed the story, the treatment of the villains, plus the high buck action scenes we expect, and the supporting characters. For that reason, I will declare this film is the best of the three. Just get ready for some tugs at the heart in the third act, where you may find yourself getting a little annoyed that another music cue (the solitary piano notes with the sad violin) is making you well up again.\n\nI will give this a 7 out of 10, despite the extra half-hour of hugging."

        "review_detailed_main": "I feel sad to be living in a time where a movie like this can get high ratings. This movie is for low-attention-span adrenaline-immuned viewers, which unfortunately there are more and more of. Unless you are a group of teenagers looking for a night-out, I would not recommend this movie at all.\n\nI didn't expect much from this movie other to be an entertaining comic-book-like story. Boy, was I disappointed. It has been no more than a collection of random fight scenes with incoherent story and almost random dialogues in-between. Also, I think the casting of Spider-man, M. J. and Aunt May are just horrible. Tom Holland appears to have the brain of a 10-year old, and Zendaya is great in other films, but as MJ she just doesn't work, same goes for Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) she looks way too young, flirty and brainless, exact opposite of what this character should be.\n\nOverall it is a slaughterhouse to everything that spider-man should stand for. It is concentrated around universes and egocentric personal problems instead of being a moral model of real-world problems. The 2.5 hours long movie seem to just be an adrenaline shot one after the other, no substance and nothing to learn from. I'm sadden by having to write this, the production quality is great but where is a plot, a moral and generally being a better person. Sony should be ashamed of themselves for dragging Stan Lee's creation through the mud like that and Marvel should consider terminating their license for this creation. Seriously."

All that being said, however, the reason I like No Way Home more than Spider-Man 2 is because I had not actually seen the Raimi trilogy until AFTER I saw No Way Home, as that movie is what made me realize how deep Spider-Man actually is and that I wanted to look more into him. So, me loving this movie the most is almost definitely because of my personal experience with it. It sparked my interest in the webbed hero with just a kid behind the mask, and it did so while also living up to the expectations of long-time veterans and fans of him. This movie is an absolute must see if you are at all interested in Spider-Man. While it may not be perfect and have its flaws (like the pacing at some points being a bit weird and having quite a slow, drawn-out startup), it is still an absolute masterpiece in the Marvel series, and the writers, directors, and all others involved in the making of this film can be happy knowing that Stan Lee is smiling down upon them from heaven, truly proud of how his beautiful character and universe is being carried on to soar high."

Am I supposed to be sad right now? Or Am I supposed to be laughing? And also I know movie has gotta movie and propel the plot forward but there were certain things that happened that felt WAY too convenient. And it sucks because this film genuinely has a good plot and themes. And some seriously dark moments in the film that gives it gravitas. I think I would have enjoyed the film more if they had just toned down some of the jokes, the meta, and some of the fan service to focus more on the story. I thought Tom Holland was great though and really stepped up into a more mature Spider-Man. And I thought the character arcs in general were good. Again, didn't hate the film. Lots of stuff to like, just overall not my favourite. I'm struggling how to rate this though...probably somewhere between a 6-7."

The most impressive exploit in the spider-man movie is how marvel leaves loose ends with every character. Which is a brilliant idea that keeps the audience guessing what's next.

The movie full of nostalgic and emotional scenes. The movie that connects all the generations together and makes a perfect ending to all the three Spider-Man franchises. In the end, this is an another masterpiece from Marvel, with the best fighting scenes I've ever seen in my life, with the best Picture, the best CGI and the best acting so far. I loved The Spider-Men relationships and I have to say that all the three legendary actors (Tom Holland, Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield) did a perfect job portraying their Spider-Men."

They have returned thanks to the multiverse, an inter-dimensional portal accessed by the stern Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) in a spell gone awry intended to restore Spider-Man's (a winning Tom Holland) anonymity after Mysterio outed Peter Parker in Spider-Man: Far From Home.\n\nThe multiverse functions as a Macguffin of sorts. It's the jumping off point for Marvel movies to do what they do best, and No Way Home doesn't disappoint, thanks to that tried and true formula of good-natured banter and giddy CGI set pieces. I liked how it taps into Electro's awesome power. I kind of imagined that Electro, played by Jamie Foxx, perhaps, and this is a big perhaps, could be a crime-fighting consultant in some future movie. And Willem Dafoe gave a tortured performance as Norman Osborn, fighting hard to silence the diabolical inner voice of Green Goblin.\n\nAll Marvel pictures have non-preachy messaging. No Way Home touches on grief, vengeance, and also makes a case for humanity's redemptive nature."

Universes collide and every nemesis of Peter Parker is searching for him. Which means that the villains (and heroes) from the previous Spider-Man films end up in the current world. Willem Dafoe and Jamie Foxx in particular are fantastic in their roles.\n\nThere is some unexpected tragedy in the film, and the heroes of the past spend a lot of time reflecting on their own misfortunes. This has an emotional impact but does slow the film down at key moments.\n\nThere is far too much CGI (as usual) so you end up watching something closer to an animation or a video game at times, with scant regard for physics. Doing so much work in front of green screens really impacts the acting as well.\n\nThe biggest issue is the superhero story itself - the bit where the good guy overcomes the bad guy. All the multiverse nonsense struggles for logic and takes a long time to set up, and Spider-Man doesn't really spend enough time fighting the bad guys at the end. The action sequences are good but they feel like an afterthought.\n\nThis is a film for the fans. The neutrals (like me) may not get so much out of it."

Not just because it is bad, but because of the misuse of all the resources that went into making it.\n\nI will be the first to admit that I have propensity to look for meaning when I am watching a film. Be it the straight-forward moral of the story or a higher meaning, something to make you think. That is how I enjoy cinema the most, when it gives me something to think about. Big or small. When the images on the screen are about something more than simply the images on the screen.\n\nThis film is the complete opposite of it. Its meaning is inward-looking. It is not interested of looking at anything other than itself. It is complete and utter navel-gazing. That really is the crux of the film. That is the reason why this is barely watchable. Every flaw and mistake comes from this movie's own excessive self-contemplation.\n\nWhere to put the blame is a different question. It has been established for some time that these MCU films are not \"directed\". There is no singular vision behind them and it boils down to an assembly line. The plot and dialogue are so bad I can't imagine anyone put any amount of thought into it. All the lines do actually feel like ad-libs the actors improvised on the day. Visually there is an absence of flair (and I am being generous) which is on par for the course for these movies by now. The soundtrack and sound design is, of course, forgettable. The editing is conventional. The set design is reminiscent of those real-estate videos where celebrities show their homes. The costume design is ok, again which is not shocking knowing the means that were allocated to this.\n\nThe acting could have been the saving grace of the movie. Unfortunately, Tom Holland, Zendaya and Jacob Batalon are the stars of the film. And while their performances are good, they usually have to share the screen with (multiple) Oscar-winners. It is jarring to see the best talent doing what is basically glorified background work. That is why this is the worst movie of all time. You have a film packed with the best actors working today, but we have to follow Tom Holland's inane struggle on how to apply to some college.\n\nI am not even sure I want to go into the plot. In truth it does not matter. I suspect that even the makers of this took that as a given. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has now morphed into a never ending reference and call-backs machine. That is the core of this film: \"remember this?!\" The structure of it is one of a TV show, except in TV there is an A-plot and a B-plot. This film is all B-plot.\n\nAs I am writing this, this film has been viewed by millions and is one of the highest grossing movies of all time. Please kill me now."

It is not about whether it's as Oscar worthy or equally quality made as Godfather, but whether it hit the right notes for the large part of the audience - which it did. If you put 1 ratings, just to lower the rating from 9/10 - that is just low life thinking, just enjoy a movie and put a real rating - from your perspective, don't try to counter attack \"marvel fanboys\" - because they put 10 due to how they feel about it. Look at Critics rating - that is a metric to show if the quality of the cinema is good or not and how much...it's 71 and I think it's fair. Don't be a low life."

Peter Parker came off as very annoying, definitely in scenes with Dr Strange and when Peter wanted to \"try\" to save the lives of the opponents from other universes. But what really frustrated me was the blatant product placement of the Hyundai, there was no need whatsoever for it to feature in the scene it did the way it did. It stopped centre on camera and the audience got a good view of this new car. Surely Sony didn't need that extra cash? Entertaining but not revolutionary. Dune was much better."

It was great fanservice and the very fact we can see all those actors unite on screen is amazing.\n\nHowever it's a mess. A very enjoyable one but still a mess. It's obviously been shot separately with the actors not being in the same rooms due to covid but it still feels stiff at times because of that. Also the CGI is slightly undercooked as they probably worked on it all the way up to release day. The first act falls flat especially when you compare it to the rest of the movie.\n\nOverall this is a good movie however it has no right to be above movies like The green mile, Inception, Interstellar, Gladiator, Alien (1979) , Django unchained etc."

Rather than coming up with new ideas for Spider-Man and the future of his character in the MCU, they chose to rehash old favourites. Whilst I understand that to a certain extent, it is a little disappointing to see so much of the film hinge on it."

With that being said it wasn't great and it wasn't the best spiderman movie. It heavily relied on nostalgia to carry the plot and development and while I can appreciate it all it didn't exactly climax as I was hoping for. Felt like the marvel series as of late just compiled into a movie instead of episodes.\n\nTom holland uses up the last of his awkward teen spiderman attitude in a overdue effort for his character to finally start truly evolving. Yet it comes pretty slow over the course of this film. Additionally, the main conflicts in this movie basically are all spidermans faults when you really think about it which makes it even less of a plot arch due to the circular reasoning behind the movie.\n\nNostalgically it carries the film for obvious reasons and while I loved what happens I feel like it wasn't as wholesome as I expected it to be.. I guess I just got a high expectation from all the great feedback of the film.\n\nThere were some glaring issues with the plots reasoning and motivations but I get it. Overlooking some of those things it felt like this film was just a filler marvel movie to set up for the next phase and it showed up in its quality. Felt more like a movie special for tom holland instead of a side series that marvel did for loki, wandavision, wintersoldier, and hawkeye. Basically the same quality and effort except instead of a series you got a movie with nostalgia.\n\nIt was still a solid film to watch but not exactly top tier from marvel. Still loved the nostalgic parts though! They might have carried this movie but it worked!"

The very first preview for the third Spidey didn't arrive until tonight, just under four months until the movie's December 17 debut, and, even then, the argument could be made that it only materialized because of a leaked - and work-in-progress - version from yesterday had forced both Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios's hand.\n\nWhile the exact nature behind this unprecedented MCU delay remains currently unknown, what is known is just how much news, rumors, and sheer speculation from seemingly all corners attempted to fill the content void over the course of the past year. And, intriguingly enough, the teaser's long-awaited arrival hasn't done much to address those ardently held theories - though it certainly has given us some bones of substance to chew on until the next, full trailer gets delivered from on high.\n\nIt's a lot to parse, so we're going to do our best to wade through it all together. Here's everything we know about the big-picture, overarching connections of No Way Home now that we've received the very first narrative confirmations (and half-confirmations, as it were)."

        "review_detailed_main": "Let me get to the point, this film is just a crossover attempt to cash in nostalgia and is easily the weakest of the three Spider-Man films so far.\n\nThe action is great but lost is the humour and the plot, if you break down the story of this film you quickly realise that \"into the spider verse\" did it better. The story of the film doesn't have the development of the previous films, the introduction of previous people just felt crammed in for the sake of it.\n\nThe plot: I'm Spider-Man Spell goes wrong Send them back No I want to cure them It goes wrong Cures them Send them back\n\nCompare it to the actual plot of say mysterio trying to steal stark tech and cashing in on peters emotions it just felt weak. The cameos are lack lustre as well only two guys really perform well with others just throwing in a line here or there, the whole thing was a nostalgia grab.\n\nIn my eyes this film with Peter being revealed should have been Spider-Man the fugitive being hunted down, introduce kraven and a Jameson backed scorpion, have a death of a major character in Spider-Man's life and then fearing more people being hurt go to dr strange for a \"forget who I am\" spell and lead into this film. The reason for wanting a spell here is \"my friends are sad\" it's just felt like a weird jump from one film to the next and it makes me worry for dr strange 2, too many characters apparently now means sacrificing genuine story.\n\nPeople say this is the best marvel film but I say take those nostalgia glasses off and compare this actual story to into the spider verse or the previous films and review it again. It's a solid average action spectacle but lacking a real plot. Kids will adore it though."

You find out in the end, but still.\n\nI particularly enjoyed the reunion portion, though that was a bit over done as well. What ever happened to the tight 100 minute movie? Is it in the contracts that each actor must get a certain amount of screen time? Yes, I know the answer.\n\nIn short, I thought Far from Home was the better flick.

(That's part of why the multiverse functioned best in Spider-verse: animated films can get away with being less tethered to reality.) Anyway, I loved seeing old characters return or the amusing banter, but this was my least favorite of the MCU Spider-man movies. The earlier tales, especially the first, worked because they felt like simpler teen movies and the main characters - Peter, Ned, MJ - had fantastic chemistry. Those moments were too few and far between here because we had so much multiverse to traverse and so much plot to explain. The twists were convoluted, the plot holes were large, and the whole thing worked better when it revolved around academic bowl and prom. Basically, my favorite MCU remains simpler MCU. Involving more villains (and heroes) than ever before was definitely not \"simple.\" They're expanding their universe, but shrinking the story. Is it fun? Yes. Could it be better? Absolutely."

Recycled parts, with a really bad appearance with Dr. Strange in it. Their tango together and how that was written is even more absurd than the story line itself. This obsession to defy rules without maturity, by this 3rd Spider-Man, was just too annoying to even come close to liking it. It must be part of the mental issues with kids out there now, \"I can fix it, and save the bad guys.\"\n\nSo very anti-climatic from leaving off from \"Far From Home.\" Stale, horrible plot, worst script, and so very dull. I wonder if Samuel L. Jackson saw the original script, and was \"Ahhh hellNaw, I ain't doing this sh t.\"\n\nFor the love of Christmas and all that is Holly and Jolly, get someone who can write, produce, and direct these movies.

The one thing that brought this movie down is the constant attempt at humor, it took what could be really cool and turned it into an SNL skit, and what should have been serious was more of a joke bc this is Marvel, everything has to be funny, all the time. Im not saying it was all bad, i got a few laughs here and there, but it was to over the top sometimes and i just think the movie would have been better if they dialed it down a notch and just told a good story without everything having to be funny."

I have not enjoyed any recent marvel films including the 2 previous spider-mans, and although I must say this was better, it still left much to be desired.\n\nThe first hour or so was pretty painful and dull, but it did pick up towards the end. I like a long film, but for an action film like this, it felt like it dragged on.\n\nThe acting was pretty poor on the whole bar Willem Dafoe who defines what it means to be a super hero villain. Yet the majority played cheesy roles with no substance.\n\nDid they try to cram too many villains in? Absolutely. Focusing on the Green Goblin was good, but the lizard guy and sandman was pretty unnecessary. Bar the obvious nostalgia.\n\nI am older and I get the film is geared towards a younger audience who for clear reasons would want to see the CGI and extravagant scenes.\n\nIs it too much to ask for a clearly defined, intricate plot these days?\n\nAnyway, it's always fun to get to the movies and i enjoyed parts for sure."

I don't think I consider too many of them masterpieces but they're enjoyable. I went into this movie wanting to like it, but instead what I got was a story that read out like someone's fanfiction without much else to offer.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the film's fine enough. There are some funny jokes and it does feel good to see Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin and Alfred Molina as Doc Ock again, but not much else than that. Peter and MJ's relationship feels very cookie-cutter and at some point you get tired of hearing washed-up actors talk about their old films.\n\nIt's not a bad movie, but highly overrated and everyone really needs to calm down over it."

        "review_detailed_main": "It would be unfair to say that I never really laud as great films BUT I always admire this ability to create quality escapism.\n\nWith all that, I think Spider-Man: No Way Home might be the first film of that series that I actually hate .\n\nFirstly, this film feels so juvenile to the point that it is annoying. I guess this is a film not really made for me. I found the way Hollands tries to plays up the good boy persona exceedingly off-putting AND not needed. Zendaya and the Filipino guy are just a figment on its story. They even tried to gentrify the \"other\" versions of Spiderman film. Funnily, I love all the treatment for the Original Spiderman characters. Otherwise, its a mixed bag.\n\nSecondly, I found the cause of conflict in the film so unnecessary. It does not make sense for me why and how it happened. It feels like watching a cash grab for fans.\n\nI mean the conflict of the film is that his presence as a superhero has such a negative effects to their live that they were ultimately banned to their collegiate school BUT it is contrast with a rally showing their popularity too. It is like be consistent film. Even the spell is hinged on the fact that they did not plan. They go on as if this is a thing he does every time BUT he just goes for it without really thinking through of the whatnots. Ultimately, the choice of Holland Peter to armchair psychologist ughh. Just watch it, its like a Bob the Builder-esque plot line.\n\nUltimately, what really sour me about the film is the Dr Strange Conundrum. Why even watch when the consequences can be reversed and played on? I mean, he did had some in the end BUT is it really not deserved. As a viewer, I hate it from since the Avenger films BUT I hate it more so this time, because it actively says it can AND it can even personalize it.\n\nOverall, this is a pure cash grab for people who are watching it for the characters but not the content. Its pretty much anchored on a very weak premise AND feels like a connective tissue for things to come. [0.5/5]"
