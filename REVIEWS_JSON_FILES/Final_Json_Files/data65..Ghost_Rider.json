        "review_detailed_main": "Ghostrider is a brilliantly designed character . The chain ,the bike , the flaming skull for a head -he's just plain cool. In fact hes TOO cool - it seems that in any comic , cartoon or game hes involved with, he always comes out as the most interesting thing.\n\nIt works the same way with the movie: seeing ghost rider in action provides almost all of the films entertainment value. Watching him ride down buildings , fight villains and flip the bird to the police is a cool sight to behold. When hes not on screen though ,things aren't that interesting. Nicholas cage is funny and quirky as johnny blaze and eva mendes is impossibly sexy (as per usual)but for the most part its all very cheesy and feels rushed and episodic.Also, the villains are frustratingly lame , including black heart who's severely downgraded from his comic book incarnation.\n\nWhen sitting through ghostrider , your best bet is to wait for the flaming skullhead to show up- watching him do his thing is tons of fun. Sadly the same cant be said about the rest of the movie.While its not bad it doesn't quite do ghostrider justice . Why ? Because hes TOO cool.........."

The special effects are fantastic, you'll be blown away when he turns into Ghost rider the first time. Although there could have been some more action, but the action was intense and wonderful. This move is great on a Friday or Saturday night. But don't see this movie on a Sunday, wanting a dramatic emotional movie like spider man. This is a movie to entertain, not make you fall in love with. So just sit back and enjoy one of the greatest Marvel movies ever"

How could they screw up a movie with a premise like this.\n\nThe acting and the dialogue was awful even with actors like Cage and Peter Fonda delivering them, and the set up was rushed, like most of the rest of the movie. The FX ranged from OK to GOOD with the first transformation scene of Blaze to Ghost Rider being pretty well done but every change from there on in is in cheap and nasty morphovision and the morphing motorcycle looked stupid even if the flaming bike itself looked cool. The bad guys were non-entities and although they were supposed to be really powerful etc they don't do anything threatening through most of the movie and Ghost Rider eventually offs them with ridiculous ease, even the main dude at the end.\n\nHonestly this movie has so many clich\u00e9s you'll be bored less than half way in and after waiting about 30 minutes for Ghost Rider to appear you just want him to get off the screen straight away since apart from looking cool he comes across as a complete dork and his dialogue consists of really bad corny one liners. Every time he comes on screen you just hope to hell he doesn't say anything and when he does you'll be so embarrassed for the poor bloke.\n\nGo get the comics instead."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's official! Mark Steven Johnson is the new Joel Schumacher. It took Schumacher two movies to bring the Batman franchise to its knees, and with only two movies, Johnson has already buried two comic book franchises with 2003's Daredevil and this month's Ghost Rider, which arrives in theaters dead-on-arrival; flat-lined, from it's hokey beginning to it's clich\u00e9d video game ending.\n\nNicolas Cage stars as Johnny Blaze, a famous Evil Knievel-esquire stunt performer that sold his soul to Mephistopheles (or Mephisto for short), played by Peter Fonda, in order to save his dying father, stricken with cancer. In a moment of young, na\u00efve, foolishness he signed, with his own blood no less, a life contract to become the devil's bounty hunter; damned to hunt down fallen angels cast out of heaven.\n\nDuring the day Johnny is normal, but at night, in the presence of evil Johnny's skin burns off and his skull lights aflame with hellfire. His motorcycle transforms into a speed demon able to travel fast enough to melt parking meters and vertically climb up sky scrapers, and in its wake, leaves behind a fiery trail of destruction.\n\nThe idea sounds kind of, well\u0085 cool, actually. Unfortunately the studio \u0096 in an attempt to cash in on the Marvel product \u0096 limited the film to a PG-13 rating in order to reel in a wider audience:10 and 12-year-old boys, which was a terrible, terrible move.\n\nInstead of a fun and wildly entertaining ride, what we got is one of the worst comic book adaptations to crash land in theaters since Batman & Robin and Catwoman. Yes, it really is THAT bad.\n\nInstead of cranking out another soft and wimpy flick about demons, hell and tortured souls straight from the formulaic, cardboard factory of clich\u00e9s, what we should have gotten was a fun, dark, R-rated blast more along the lines of Blade or The Crow, heck, even Spawn had more bite and attitude! It seems like Johnson isn't even passionate or interested in telling his own story, and it shows.\n\nThe heavily forced and completely uninteresting romance between Johnny Blaze and his long-time love, Roxanne Simpson (played by Eva Mendes) has but not a spark of chemistry. Mendes is given little to do, and does little more than stand around and look pretty as the \"damsel in distress\", whose only real talent is an impressive bust-line.\n\nNicolas Cage \u0096 who is an expressed fan of the Ghost Rider comics \u0096 is one of the film's biggest flaws; completely miscast as the macho avenger. Cage is a talented actor when working with the right material (see his performances in the underrated Bringing out the Dead and Matchstick Men), but at the age of 43 (pretending to be 28), and his James Stewart persona of acting just isn't what this particular film calls for.\n\nWhat it needed was an actor with a hard edge and some grit, someone with the kind of tough-guy presence, like a young Clint Eastwood. Thomas Jane might have made a nice Ghost Rider, and I'm sure if someone like Robert Rodriguez had been working behind the camera we would have gotten that fun, R-rated ride that we should have had to begin with.\n\nThe film tries to do many things, and succeeds at nothing. It tries to be humorous, but nothing is funny. The scene in which Johnny tries to explain his night-time dark side to his girlfriend aims to be funny, but all I could think about was the scene in Batman, where Michael Keaton compares his superhero gig as being just another job to Kim Basinger.\n\nGhost Rider also tries to be scary, but nothing comes close to being frightening, and in the end, after all its constant failures, amounts to little more than boredom. Normally I don't do it, but I was tempted to walk out.\n\nThroughout the film Johnny Blaze talks about deserving a second chance, in order to turn things around, for the better. Cage is an actor who deserves a second chance, especially coming off last year's \"it's so bad, it's good\" remake of The Wicker Man. As for writer/director Mark Steven Johnson, he's had his second chance. This whole comic book movie thing just isn't your game, kid."

However, if you're looking for a movie that's a lot of fun and is going to keep you entertained, then this is exactly what you're looking for.\n\nThe visual effects in this movie are, simply put, amazing. Ghost Rider is just one of those movies that's cool to look at. As I said before, the acting sometimes falls a bit flat, but Nicolas Cage does exactly what's expected of him for the role. It's a bit clich\u00e9 and humorous at times, but this is a movie based on a comic book, so you have to expect that sort of thing.\n\nSam Elliot and Peter Fonda provide the best acting in the movie, while Wes Bentley does a solid job as Blackheart and Eva Mendez is just a very beautiful actress who fits in well as Roxanne.\n\nThere are a lot of little gripes about this movie if you look too hard and overthink it, but as a die-hard Ghost Rider fan, I didn't mind these things so much. It stayed relatively true to the original series, while borrowing elements from the 90's series to help make the movie more visually impressive, which I felt worked really well.\n\nI've been waiting for this movie since they started trying to make it over eight years ago and overall, I'd have to say I really enjoyed seeing my favorite comic book character finally make it onto the big screen.\n\nIf you want to go see a movie where you can just sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride; then go see Ghost Rider without any worry of disappointment."

Years later, Blaze (now Nicolas Cage), a world renowned bike daredevil starts to turn into the Ghost Rider (sort of the devil's henchman who's job is to capture the souls of evil men. He also has to contend with Blackheart, a goth looking demonic villain whom is the least intimidating heavy in a film in recent memory. What's the saying about the third time being the charm? Well sometimes that's simply not true. Director Mark Johnson's third comic-book based film (after the dire Darevil and simply putrid Elektra) proves just that with this supremely boring joke of a film. Bad acting, a plot that fails to do the comic that it's based on justice, and an aforementioned supremely awful villain all collide to make this disaster such a chore to sit through. By the time that the Ghost Rider dons his trademark leather studded jacket, I was too bored to care, so later in the movie when Johnny Blaze utters \"is this thing ever gonna end?\" it was like he read my mind. It's all fun and games till Johnson gets his hands on/ royally screws up a sincerely great comic-book, say something like \"Preacher\"\n\nMy Grade: D"

This movie is almost like the Blade movies in terms of how Ghost Rider fights evil that's from hell but this is way better than Blade. So anyway, Nicolas Cage plays the wild stunt biker, Johnny Blaze who makes a deal to Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) in order to save his father and in return has to forget about his life and his love, Roxanne Simpson (Eva Mendes). A few years later, Johnny's path crosses again with Mephistopheles to give up his soul to have Johnny become the fiery bounty hunter of hell, Ghost Rider in order to take down Blackheart (Wes Bentley), a son and enemy of Mephistopheles. Nicolas Cage did a great job playing Ghost Rider and of course it's always nice to see Eva Mendes on screen of course. The only thing that I didn't like about this movie is how they decided to put in a villain who turned out to be an easy defeat instead of picking one that would be more of a challenge but then again it's an origin movie so everything has to start off easy i guess. But hopefully there will a more challenging villain if they do a Ghost Rider 2. Overall i'd recommend this movie and I hope they do a Ghost Rider 2."

My expectations may have been a little high, but still the movie was pretty awful. It is the only movie I have ever considered walking out on. It certainly had great potential, but truly the execution was off. Throughout the film bad blocking, very corny lines, and bad editing plagued a great comic movie idea. I think that the editing crew was aware of the failures. It was clear that they sliced out every possible plot transition, but were somehow able to keep the extensive camera time devoted to squished cleavage. Maybe this was to distract most people from the train wreck of a movie they had paid good money to see. Lines were always delivered like a bad high school play. They had the opportunity to save it with a little self mocking--you know Evil Dead style, but apparently, no one recognized how awful the script was even as they said it. What a shame. The director, producer, and even some of the cast deserve a penance stare for the mediocrity they have unleashed upon the world."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ghost Rider is a halfway decent comic book movie brought to the big screen but it's not memorable like Spider-man 2, X-Men United, Batman Begins, or The Dark Knight. The movie isn't all that bad. Ghost Rider is no Elektra, Punisher War Zone, Daredevil, or Spider man 3 but it's not that much better either. Director Mark Steven Johnson does an okay job of bringing Ghost Rider to big screen but the bad outweighs the good in this one. I'll get back to that later. Nicolas Cage whose recent films (The Wicker Man and Bankok Dangerous to name a few) haven't been that great but fortunately in this one he's all right as Johnny Blaze who becomes a hell blazing vigilante with a skull thats covered in flames for a face. Eva Mendes is decent as Johnny's love Roxanne Simpson but she doesn't really get much to do. The rest of the cast are admirable in their roles including Wes Bentley as the devil's son Blackheart, Sam Elliot as a mysterious cemetery caretaker, and Peter Fonda as Satan himself. Donal Logue makes a brief appearance as Johnny's friend Mack and he does a good job with the small part but he like many other characters in the film doesn't have much to do and lacks screen time. Some other flaws with this movie was that the dialogue wasn't the greatest at times, the CGI to create Ghost Rider and his bike looks cool but nothing we haven't seen before, the action/fight sequences are good but none of them stand out and the lack of a central villain. There are about three other villains for Ghost Rider to face besides Bentley and Fonda. The special effects used to create their powers were impressive but none of them are in it long enough to leave an impression. If you're a Nicolas Cage fan you might like this one better than I did because Ghost Rider isn't one of his best movies. No offense to Cage who is a good actor but Ghost Rider overall is a movie that could've been much better than it was."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ghost Rider was always a cool comic book character. So why not make it into a movie? Although this movie had a great financial success, its screenplay is actually quite sloppy. I'm surprised it did so well. I liked Ghost Rider. I liked the visuals, the action, and the villains (a little). But I felt things could have been polished. Mark Steven Johnson who directed and wrote the story for this movie could have done better.\n\nTo start off, Nicolas Cage plays as the anti-hero Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider. I really like the way they made Ghost Rider look in this film. Just like a bat out of hell, his skull is cloaked in flames, his jacket has spikes on it, he has a flame chain, and his bike has a mind of its own! Much of it is fun to watch. Just seeing Ghost Rider for the first time on screen was pretty awesome to see. The action was good too. Any of the sarcastic comments Ghost Rider makes in this film is funny to hear. I even thought the actors who played the villains were good. What destroyed all these good moments, was how the character's dialogs were brought out.\n\nMost of the dialog in this movie is weird, if not awkward. Mostly due to Cage's character, Johnny Blaze. I guess Mark Steven Johnson figured because Blaze lost his soul to the devil, he might as well lose his personality too. If that's the case, it was not a smart choice. It almost seems like Cage AND ONLY Cage is uncomfortable with his character. I know he's a fan of Ghost Rider but it seems like the script was written out of wack for him. There are parts where it seems like Cage is lost in himself and doesn't know what to say next. I don't quite understand that. One other thing I didn't comprehend was that there was way too much \"pointing while zooming up on the face\" business. Was the director trying to make a trademark for himself in this film? Not only is it redundant, it can be very obnoxious.\n\nThe other element that does not work here are the villains. I liked the bad guys in this movie. They looked frightening to me when I first saw them. But then I noticed a trend as Ghost Rider had finished one off at a time. None of the bad guys really did anything. Blackheart, the son of the devil, has henchmen who have powers like the characters from Avatar: The Last Airbender, except they don't involve all the martial arts moves. Before Ghost Rider is about to finish one of Blackheart's henchman, we don't even see him use any of his powers. Well that was kind of anti-climactic. Even Blackheart himself barely uses his \"almighty\" powers against Ghost Rider. It's really disappointing to watch.\n\nBesides these parts of the film, I enjoyed Christopher Young's soundtrack. It has a lot of guitar in it and creates a punk tone to the action. Sam Elliot appears in this movie as a minor character, he's always fun to listen too but even he can't make up for the bad screenplay. It's unfortunate because I really like Ghost Rider as a character and was expecting something a little more darker for a dark character.\n\nGhost Rider will please fans to a point, with its good action and awesome special effects. But nothing can help the film recover from its lazy screenplay, awkward dialog and dull villains."

Alright, now for the beginning. The actors that portray Nick Cage and Eva Mendes in the opening of this film should probably look elsewhere for a career choice because there acting ability truly shows how bad they are as actors. Now once the film gets going, it picks up with the false feel of nostalgia. Nick Cage, needs to stop. I mean really stop, he shouldn't take himself so seriously, cuz it ain't workin'. Eva Mendes, who is smoking' hot, can't act. And I really can't recall any time when she could. Thats the biggest grief of this film, the acting. Peter Fonda, appears to be smoking' the same stuff that he's been doing since Easy Rider, so he's the same. But in this role he's just stupid. With a line like, \"Far Out\" as his first it truly take you bag to the late sixties and the time when everything and everyone was truly free. Thats why the film gets two stars, and thats it. The other supporting roles are dumb to the point of unbelief. Why would anyone seriously want to finance this movie. I don't know, but I wouldn't.

Nicolas Cage works well in the role; his dead-pan humor is well suited to the role of motorcycle stuntman Johnny Blaze, and the scene in which he attempts to explain himself to his long-lost girlfriend is classic stuff, full of awkward pauses and an eyebrow put to good use.\n\nGranted, things get a little melodramatic from time to time, but that's as it should be. This is, after all, a movie based on a comic book hero, and what superhero worth his heat-vision doesn't indulge in a dose of the melodramatic every so often? It comes with the territory. Still, there's a sense of humor at work here, something that didn't play out well in the \"X-Men\" franchise and led to that abysmal third installation. There are a good number of laughs in \"Ghost Rider.\" This isn't a movie that takes itself too seriously, which is a nice benefit considering how heavy the subject matter could become. It's rough around the edges, no doubt, and isn't quite up to the same level as the Spiderman movies to date.\n\nI saw an early (11:45 AM) show and the theater was still nearly full. The audience laughed at points that were intended as humorous and even jumped at a couple of scenes. All in all, everyone looked like they were having a good time, from the six year olds with their parents to the older folks like me who were fans of this comic as kids. If you're looking for something fun, \"Ghost Rider\" isn't a bad bet at all."

While not the best adaptation of a comic book (graphic novel if you prefer) to the screen, the special effects are awesome and the photography is Oscar worthy. Cage is Cage, that stoic actor who seems somehow devoid of emotion in most of his films. Mendez is hot, goes without saying, and equals Cage's level of emotion. Sam Elliot and Peter Fonda are the saving graces of the film, both adding a dimension of emotion lacking in the main characters. The prelude scenes of young Johnny and Roxanne are somewhat necessary, but could have been trimmed down to include more footage of the Ghost Rider and his missions. I haven't seen the newest film, just released at this writing, but hopefully the characters have been \"fleshed out\" and the plot concentrates more on the present than the past. With Cage being the only holdover for the new movie, perhaps the new directors can up the game a bit. The original film is rated PG-13 for violence and language, but nothing the teens haven't seen in their video games. Collectible? If you are a Marvel fan like I am, probably. As as classic film? No way. But entertaining."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm usually very tolerant when it comes to comic-book movies. For some reason i like them even though i don't particularly like comic books. I guess it's the way that they can bend reality with an alibi to do so, as opposed to when they do it in a regular action movie. In the end though rocking action scenes, or a good solid story, is needed to make it work. There are loads of examples of movies that did work with different approaches. Like comedy (Spider-man), action (X-Men) and emotion/story (Hulk by Ang Lee). This movie however doesn't really have an approach...\n\nI can freely admit to never having heard of the character Ghostrider before this movie. And i'm not surprised, it's not a very interesting character. And it works less well in a live-action movie. Considering the Ghostrider is basically just a special-effect with a flaming skull, there's not much acting to be done. Nicholas Cage is his usual self as the troubled man who turns into Ghostrider at night. Whether Nicholas Cage being himself is a good thing or not is up to you to decide. The rest of the performances range from dignified (Peter Fonda) to downright silly (Wes Bentley).\n\nThe real problem here is not the acting though, it's the fact that the movie has precious little to offer. It lacks direction and purpose almost completely. It's too slow and lame to be a good action-movie (although there are a few decent special-effects scenes), it lacks comedy almost completely and the story is too lame and shallow to carry the movie. I guess going for the action-angle would have been the best way, but the Ghostrider doesn't really have any interesting ways to fight. He punches people, strangles them with chains and looks deep into their eyes. The fact that the money seems to have run before they got the flaming-skull effect right doesn't help either.\n\nThe thing i was thinking when the movie was over was \"Spawn\" from 1997. This movie reminded me so much about Spawn that it could easily have been a sequel. Both movies are very heavy on special effects (although this one is obviously light-years better in that department, or well, ten regular years...), both have an anti-hero with connections to the devil, both seriously lack weight in the action-scenes. And in the end both of them are thoroughly dull, and while they make a lot of noise, they have precious little to offer in the way of entertainment.\n\nI rate this 3/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "First off, I'd like to say that I really enjoyed this movie. I have read a lot of the bad hype that the flick has receieved, and I believe that this is partly due to the fact that people go into these types of movies expecting amazing advances in cinematography as well as a gripping and dramatic plot. Well, I hate to burst everybody's bubble, but that is really not the purpose of this type of movie. These bad reviews make me wonder just how serious you have to be (or just how snobby a critic) going into the theater to hate this type of movie making.\n\nFar be it from me to say that this movie was perfect. It had its flaws and there were times when I found myself snickering at the silliness of it all, but that to me is good entertainment. The scenes where Cage turned into ghost rider for the first time were fairly intense, and I found myself marveling at the coolness of his transformation and powers. I also enjoyed the battle scenes including one involving ghost rider and a helicopter (I won't tell you what happens there, but it is pretty amusing). I also felt that the movie was pretty well-acted overall, and the entire flick maintained an aura of fun throughout (which I believe was the main purpose of the whole thing) while flowing smoothly through a simple plot.\n\nIf you are the type of person to over-analyze plots, scrutinize special effects, whine about some cheesy acting or if you get offended when a movie doesn't have a deep and philosophical meaning behind it, this is definitely not a movie you should waste your time or money on.\n\nIf, however, you are the type of person who enjoys some good laughs, some over the top (and at times cheesy) comic book acting, cool battle scenes, action and adventure, or if you simply just like to see some guy with a flaming skull, this is worth the 8 bucks to get into a theater seat."

I had been a Superman fan all my live, but in the comic stores the character of Ghost Rider had some attraction to me, as the non-typical superhero. Now that i saw the movie, i was amazed of the great story behind this guy. A superhero that fight evil of the worst kind!, just great, a combination of a superhero and some horror - type characters; great complement!. It isn't an Oscar worth movie, but is a film to have a good time, is fun, entertaining, with action, and the type of movie that you can see in company with kids. Great special effects and night scenes that put a special charm in the film. Eva Mendes is absolutely beautiful as always!\n\nABOUT THE MOVIE: Nicolas Cage plays here Johny Blaze, a motorcyclist that used to make dangerous shows with his father Barton Blaze (Brett Cullen), when doctors detected to his father a cancer in his terminal stage, a demon called Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) offers to save him in change for his soul; Johny do this, but this demon or devil, deceived Johny, when at the next day his father dies on an accident in the show. Johny has his soul sold, and loses his all-life love, Roxanne (Eva Mendes), years later Blaze became a famous motorcyclist, who performed very dangerous shows; with a great team leaded by Mack (Donal Logue) he even jumped over helicopters. Suddenly he meet again with Roxane, but in that moment, Mephistopheles claimed the right for Johny's services, and turn him in a Ghost Rider, one of the servants of the devil that looked at night like a skeleton on fire. Mephistopheles order him to defeat his \"cold\" son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) who wanted to claim the old contract of San Venganza, with the help of other demons that represented the natural elements earth, water and air; this contract was hidden by a previous Rider to the devil, in order to prevent the possession of 1000 souls!. Blackheart threaten to bring hell to earth with these 1000 demons! Here Blaze mission start as an incredible action quest as this new Rider!\n\n7/10, good work of Mark Steven Johnson in another of his hero movies, and a good performance of Cage and great special effects!. Worth to watch!"

I'd already been planning on seeing it, as I am a fan of the character, and I typically enjoy Nicolas Cage movies. The trailers I'd seen had not filled me with hope, so I was expecting a bad, but still enjoyable movie, along the same lines of Daredevil and X-Men 3. I was thoroughly disappointed.\n\nThe movie began, and I was entertained to see that they were including the original western Ghost Rider in the story, even if they had to completely change the character in order to do so. The movie continued, and I was further impressed that they got Johnny Blaze's origin story right. My nervousness about the quality of the movie began to subside. But then the movie continued further.\n\nIt seems that part of the Ghost Rider curse is constant pointing and the spouting of one liners. To say nothing of the re-use of CGI. I don't know how many times I saw the same clip of Ghost Rider flipping his chain around his torso to put it away. Some other reviews have said that the fights were excellent. What fights? I don't know what movie they saw, but I did not see any fights that lasted longer than several seconds.\n\nAs I said, my ticket to see the movie was free. I want my gas money refunded. And leaving the theater, I was not the only person muttering that. Nor were we in the minority.\n\nAll in all, all I can say is \"Mark Steven Johnson, your soul is tainted with the blood of the innocent. Look into my eyes.\""

        "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: Ghost Rider",
        "review_detailed_main": "Mark Steven Johnson, I hate to break it to you. 3 strikes and you're out. I understand your earnestness in trying to write-direct Marvel superhero movies by trying to stay close to the source material, but somehow they all turn out to be mediocre efforts. Although you didn't direct Elecktra, you produced and wrote it, and wrote-directed Daredevil and now Ghost Rider. I enjoyed Daredevil even though most others did not, and that unfortunately was your best effort.\n\nMarvel superheroes have their fair share of material being translated to the big screen, the largest cash cow being Spiderman, which opened the doors for efforts like The Hulk and Fantastic Four, creations of Stan Lee, and others, which I deem on the lower echelons, like Daredevil, Punisher, and Ghost Rider. The floodgates have not closed, as Spiderman and Fantastic Four will spawn their sequels this year, with Iron Man coming our way as well. Naturally not all the movies are hits, and too bad, I had hopes for Ghost Rider to join the hit list, even though I've not faithfully followed the comic books nor am a fan.\n\nI'm not quick to dismiss that comic book material can't be turned into powerful motion pictures. Batman Begins and the Spiderman movies have earned their mark of respect for having that emotional oomph to engage the audience, coupled with effects and stunts to wow. I guess we're spoilt from the excellent efforts of Christopher Nolan and Sam Raimi, as they've raised the bar and their movies are now the de facto benchmarks for comic book adaptations to reach.\n\nThe first sign that things aren't going all that well, was that this movie was postponed, if I recall correctly, for almost one year, on the pretext of jazzing up the special effects. True, the flames on the skull were as realistic as can be, but that's about it. Every other effect seemed quite ordinary, and nothing to make the jaw drop. In fact, some CGI shots became so repetitive, that you start to wonder if the same clip was being recycled to save time.\n\nIn essence, much like the origins of Daredevil, Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) unwittingly signs a pact with the devil Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda), and indirectly caused the death of his father. Blaming himself, and because of the sale of his soul to the devil, he abandons all hope in life, and his true love Roxanne (Eva Mendes), and leads a dangerous life as a stunt biker who throws caution to the wind, knowing that he can't perish because of his secret \"guardian angel\", and awaits the day when he can be free from fear and blame.\n\nFast forward to the quick introduction of the main villain Blackheart (Wes Bentley), son of the devil, who recruits the Elementals (Earth, Wind and Water spirits of sorts) in his cause to bring hell on earth. Yes, it's Constantine all over again. The plot was too vanilla plain, lacking much conflicts to challenge our anti-hero, besides his love interest. The villains, especially the Elementals, were a joke, and were so easily dispatched, that you'll scream for your money back.\n\nGiven that it's an origin story of sorts, you'll get to see how Johnny becomes the rider who can walk on both worlds, and slowly get introduced to how he got his tools of the trade, including his jacket, gloves, chain, bike and shotgun. Unfortunately, one of the Rider's powers, the Penance Stare, is overused, and to cinematic audiences, we've probably seen a similar version in Alex Proyas' directed The Crow starring the late Brandon Lee. While there are some remotely funny moments, most of the time the humour seemed contrived, and you'll probably cringe at some of the cheesy Western reference, no thanks too to one of the tracks performed by Spiderbait.\n\nIf you're on the lookout for Stan Lee, who frequently pops into the Marvel films, don't. I think by steering clear, it's another indication that well, perhaps it's not as good a job as it should be. The narrative sagged in the middle, and contained some illogical, lazy plot moments, like a public transformation, and a busy jail house with no cops (yeah right).\n\nNicolas Cage could have been Superman with a hairpiece, but I thought he looked good as Johnny Blaze with a hairpiece. To his fans, you would've already seen the acting range he showed here, especially from John Woo's Face Off. That crazed look with the eyeballs almost popping out is repeated here, and at times, his Castor Troy scene comes to mind. Eva Mendes was largely wasted as the buxomy Roxanne who cock teases Johnny, and you actually wonder what Wes Bentley is doing in a movie like this. Sam Elliot shows up as the Caretaker, and is actually involved in a pretty cool scene which you might have seen revealed in the trailer.\n\nAll in all, I would still say an enjoyable movie if you don't compare to, or have seen some of the other movies which I've mentioned above. It should do well at the box office in the initial week, before word of mouth gets to it. Fans of Ghost Rider, I sure would like to hear your views if you've liked it, or not, because after all, the fans are the ones who hold their hero dear."

Ghost Rider is the epitome of what turns people off about comic books and the movies made from them: all special effects, little logic, characterization or drama.\n\nAdmittedly, the movie starts out fine by telling the story behind Johnny Blaze's deal with the devil. But once Ghost Rider is introduced, Johnson eschews coherent narrative for a series of \"cool\" scenes cribbed from the comics, with little logic or coherent dramatic context.\n\nAmong the actors, the movie's saving grace seems to be Wes Bently, who aptly plays the role of Blackheart. Nicholas Cage is entertaining to watch, particularly when he tries to explain his \"situation\" to childhood sweetheart Roxanne (Eva Mendes) but his flippancy otherwise undercuts his character's should-be mythic status.\n\nOverall, the film is a big disappointment, although it shouldn't have been given Johnson's track record with Daredevil. He is losing whatever goodwill audiences developed for 'comicbook'movies in the wake of Batman Begins and the Spider-man and X-Men films."

        "review_detailed_main": "Reviewed By Sarhan \"MyWord\" Rashid, Singapore\n\nEvery cinematic genre sooner of later arrives at a point of stagnation. A point where the characters, their conflicts, challenges and circumstances may vary but the plot doesn't stray too far away from a given formula.\n\nGood examples are rom-coms. How many times have you sat through the story of an ugly duckling who transforms herself into a glamour queen so the high school stud would finally take notice of her only to realize in the penultimate scenes that her prince charming was always her nerdy best friend who saw her real beauty (Awww!). Make a few changes here and there and you have the script to another predictable and often lucrative rom-com.\n\nNo genre can be free of this curse as long as the Hollywood money machine is willing and able to fork out the big bucks for the \"visions\" of uninspired creative minds such as the director of \"Ghost Rider\" Mark Steven Johnson (MSJ).\n\nComic book adaptations, namely those based on superheroes, have largely stuck to a simple structure -\n\n01. Lead protagonist gains one or more extraordinary powers. 02. Learns to use them. 03. The evil plan(s) of a sinister villain is unveiled. 04. Title character(s) sets out to stop sinister villain.\n\nBy now you should know how it ends. Just like rom-coms, or any other genre, sticking to a formula isn't always a bad thing (see \"Batman Begins\"). It is however a step backwards for the genre when the movie fails to set itself apart from the rest. \"Ghost Rider\" lavishly succeeds at that.\n\nThat isn't to say it is without any merits or that the makers didn't try.\n\nKudos to MSJ and his team for adapting a complicated character such as this whose convoluted back story would be enough to deter most away.\n\nThe problem lies in the entire movie feeling like one big \"been there, done that\" moment. Hardly anything grips you and each scene plays out just as you would imagine it to.\n\nFortunately there's Nicholas Cage to save the movie with his fun performance. His dual performance as both Johhny Blaze and the Ghost Rider light up (no pun intended) the screen.\n\nThe film makers however seem dead set on canceling out any positive element with a negative. Here it's Eva Mendes showing off the wonders of the push-up bra. Tantalising as her mammaries might be they can't distract from her miscast appearance as Roxanne, Johnny's love interest.\n\nFor a hero to win over an audience one needs to pit him against a formidable foe. A creation so reprehensible the viewers would want nothing more than to see his demise at the hands of their hero. In this case we're treated to Wes Bently hamming it up to laughable results as Blackheart, the son of the devil (Peter Fonda as daddy dearest Mephistopheles). A lot of detail has gone into the appearance of all the characters including the Blackheart's poorly utilised henchmen. Too bad they didn't spend as much time etching their characterisations.\n\nBesides Nic Cage's energetic performance the only other saving grace are the fantastic effects on display. Don't be fooled by the shoddy special effects you've seen in the trailers. The Ghost Rider has been visualised perfectly. I just wish they didn't ruin his first transformation with all those quick jarring cuts.\n\n\"Ghost Rider\" succeeds moderately as another generic superhero popcorn flick. Sadly it is easily forgotten by the time the end credits roll. This doesn't weigh in too well for the chances of a sequel but $30 million plus over the weekend (plus foreign box-office gross) will go a long way in proving any critic wrong.\n\nReviewed By Sarhan \"MyWord\" Rashid, Singapore"

        "review_detailed_main": "It wasn't that easy to figure out exactly what was going on until Sam Elliot's character explained things 60 percent of the way into the film, but it sure was a fun ride watching it, at any rate. Watching this, I wondered several times how or why a veteran actor like Nicholas Cage (or Elliott) can play these goofy roles. I can't imagine actually immersing oneself in roles like this for several months. No wonder most actors are whacked. Anyway, I like Cage and he's fun to watch, whatever crazy role he plays. He was good in here, and they gave him some excellent lines to deliver.\n\nThis movie had a comic-book style for much of it, but then seemed to go more with a horror story, becoming too dark, in my opinion. Then again, my comic book experience goes way back and today's comics apparently are mostly-dark stories. If Marvel Comics have become that dark well, I am sorry that kids can't enjoy some lighter material and still enjoy real \"super heroes.\" However, the end of the film espoused some good values, I'll give it that.\n\nSpeaking the ending, that was my major complaint. It went on too long. This film, with the fun special-effects that were really \"hot,\" pun intended, would have been far better had it been cut down 20 to 30 minutes. Two hours was too long, as it turned out.\n\nThe other complaint would be the acting of Peter Fonda. He had a great role as the Devil but botched it up with one of the most wooden deliveries I've ever heard on film. After all these years, you'd think a little of his father's acting talent would have rubbed off....but not so.\n\nOverall, this turns out to be what a lot of other people thought: better than anticipated in some areas, and worse in others and making the movie as a whole just \"fair.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "1st watched 12/2/2008 \u0096 (Dir-Mark Steven Johnson): Fun and well-made comic book adaptation that was much better than I expected. I had heard a lot of bad talk about the movie and Nicholas Cage's performance in the title role but it definitely wasn't the case to me. Cage plays the older version of the main character who made a deal with the devil(played wonderfully by Peter Fonda) when he was a young so that his dad would get better. Unfortunately, the devil kills his dad during his next motorcycle stunt and the young ghost rider is stuck with being a helper for the dark one for the rest of his life. He's called to bring back the son of the devil back to hell and from this point on at nighttime he turns into the fiery-skulled character from the comic books. There is a side story about a caretaker(a former ghost rider), played by Sam Elliot, who protects and mentors the younger ghost rider and another side story involving an attempted romantic involvement with an old flame who becomes a reporter, played by Eva Mendes. She just happens to be following and reporting on Johnny Blade, who is a popular stunt rider and Cage's normal daytime character. These extra stories add to the piece, but the basic storyline is really all that is necessary to make this an entertaining movie. Cage's performance is dead-on and this unique storyline makes for a different superhero movie. Sure, Mendes isn't much more than nice to look at and Elliot pretty much plays the same character that he's done in hundreds of movies but overall the movie was a positive experience which I'm afraid won't have a sequel although I'd like to see one"

Every look on his face, everything he says, it s downright hysterical! The movie itself: The plot sucked, the dialog sucked harder, the special effects could have been way better...the close-ups, the slow motion, the one liners...it is way overdone. I expected way better from the guy who brought us Daredevil, a Marvel-production I did appreciate as a movie. Ghost Rider just isn't a movie, it's a joke...\n\nBut that didn't stop me from enjoying it just this once... on the contrary, I m glad I've seen it (just this once) 5 out of 10 for this comedy classic"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is yet another comic-book movie that, this time, doesn't dissappoint. It certainly does not. It's definitely one hell of a way to start off the 2007 movie blockbuster list.\n\nGhost Rider had high expectations of showing off a new side to comicbook based movies: horror. There are some pretty cool horror moments, especially involving Blackheart. When Johnny Blaze turns into Ghost Rider for the first time, it scared me not only by the look of his eyes, but how frighteningly realistic it looked as well.\n\nThat brings me to another point: visual effects. They're a lot better than your average comicbook visual effects. When Blackheart's face turns into his more demonic-looking face, it looked so REAL.\n\nThere were a lot of amazing things about this movie that caught my attention, but like every comicbook based movie, there has to be something bad about it as well.\n\nFirst, the GOOD things:\n\n1: visual effects were off the chart in Ghost Rider. They all looked extraordinarily real, including Johnny's first ever transformation into Ghost Rider. Other nominees include Blacheart's demonic face, and especially Gressil's sand transformation.\n\n2: Most of the acting was well put and directed quite well. Nicholas Cage isn't the best Ghost Rider, but Ben Affleck sure as hell isn't the best Daredevil. Cage still stayed true to the role. Eva Mendes and Roxxanne Simpson was OK. It wasn't the perfect acting, but it worked for me. Last, but CERTAINLY NOT least, is Wes Bently as Blackheart. There was something about Bently that made me believe Blackheart was actually real, that it was the actual Blackheart acting as himself. To me, his best line had to be \"He sent you to bring me back. Well I'm not going back!! I LIKE IT HERE!!!\". Thanks to the voice sycncronizers, this wouldn't have been possible. He definitely brought the character to life, and thats why he is the best actor in this movie.\n\n3: Electronic guitars and drums in a original soundtrack: INSANE!!\n\nNow, unfortunately, the BAD things:\n\n1: One thing that kept bothering me throughout the movie was Cage's acting. Some of it was OK, while most of it made me feel like I was watching a mix of Saturday Night Live/Soup Opera. I think the cheesiest line was when he told Roxxanne who he really is. Was he mumbling? Was he trying to exagorate? I'll never understand it.\n\n2: Now in most action/superhero movies, there has to be some form of side villain. In all three Blade movies, you got Quinn, Reinhardt, and Triple H. Now in Ghost Rider, we have three fallen angels: Gressil, Wallow, and Abigor. All represent an element of earth. Do they provide a challenge for Ghost Rider? NO. They're OK, but each one had little screen time, and they were all unfocused to a point where we didn't really understand them that much.\n\n3: Now not that this isn't important, but isn't this movie TOO scary for little 12 year old kids? When I saw Ghost Rider in theaters, some 11-12 year old kid screamed and cried when Blackheart was walking out in the desert and put his face to the camera to show his demon face!! And he was siting in the very first row, right by the screen!! I got a look at this kid and he had to be around 12 years old. Embarrassing.\n\nGhost Rider is as amazing and breathtaking as any other Marvel/DC Comic movie. It ain't perfect, but it doesn't mean to be. It totally beats the failure of Daredevil and Elektra, but doesn't beat the perfection of Spiderman and Batman."

I had seen the bad reviews and thought that maybe i shouldn't see it, but my girlfriend really has a thing for Nic Cage and I couldn't tell her no, so we went to see it today.\n\nNow, I did want to see the movie when i saw the trailers. I thought it looked badass. It's the Rider, man. One of the coolest looking comic characters of all time, and in that regard, the movie delivered. Ghost Rider looked super cool in this movie and he did all the cool stuff you wanted him to do. From there, it takes a turn for the worst.\n\n\"The thing about legends is...sometimes, they're real.\" Lines like this hit your ear like nails on a chalkboard and others just seem so forced. There's plenty of bad lines and awful jokes to go around. I had heard that Cage wrote some of the scenes in the movie, I'm betting that every line of bad dialogue came from his bald little noggin. Nic Cage is a good actor, I'll admit that. But if you don't control his performance, he will, and you don't want that.\n\nWes Bentley has a terrible performance, so does the old rider. I don't even know what the actor's name is, and I'm not going to look it up right now. He's the old guy though. The caretaker. And he has some very bad lines, so i guess with the material provided, he did a decent job. The rest of the cast performs abley, but nothing noteworthy.\n\nIn closing, if you wanna see some cool Ghost Rider effects, then you should check the movie out (The Grindhouse trailer alone made it worth 6 bucks to me), but if you are looking for a great flick, maybe you should wait for 300 (here's hoping 300 turns out as we all dream).\n\nLet's ride.."

        "review_detailed_main": "I admit that when i first saw Ghost Rider on t.v i didn't really like it, i thought it was too cheesy but i recently gave it another try because i love most of the Marvel studios films. Yes i was a fan of the early 2000's Marvel films, well before the Connected Universe stuff, I'm a big fan of the Excellent 2003 The Punisher, starring Thomas Jane, it's an underrated CLASSIC in my opinion!!! Also the fantastic Ang Lee directed Superhero Drama \"Hulk\" from 2003, starring Eric Bana & then there's the extremely underrated \"Daredevil\" from 2003, starring Ben Affleck, also the Excellent Sam Raimi directed Spiderman Trilogy, Marvel was already making excellent but very underrated movies way back then. Now, Ghost Rider fits into the very underrated Marvel movies. I recently brought it on dvd & watched it & was totally surprised by how much i enjoyed it, a fantasy western Horror Thriller. I've always liked Nicolas Cage & here he's perfectly cast as the cocky & crazy bad-ass motorcycle stuntman JOHNNY BLAZE!!! IT'S such a fun character for Cage to sink his teeth into & create an Awesome leather-jacket wearing demon Anti-hero, it's like it was made for Nicolas Cage.\n\nHere a Young Johnny Blaze sells his soul to the Devil, played by Hollywood legend Peter Fonda R.I.P, in order to save his dying dad but in doing that he has become a Warrior from hell that has to carry out kills for the Devil himself. Johnny Blaze goes against the Devil & becomes a type of Anti-hero but he has the fight against some other powerful demons that want to destroy the world, it's full on Comic-book fantasy stuff. The cast is rounded out with the always Awesome & rugged, Sam Elliott as a mysterious Caretaker that knows alot about the forces of darkness, also Eva Mendes stars as Roxanne, the love of Johnny Blaze's life. The cast are all great in their roles. A big great part of this movie is the incredible special effects, especially when Johnny Blaze transforms into the Ghost Rider, with flames pouring out of his face revealing a skull & it's done fantasticly!!! The glowing fire against the dark, gritty & grimy streets is a mesmerising visual treat, the cinematography really is fantastic. Yes the look of the movie is stunning & the music is Cool & the action is fast & furious!!! Seeing Ghost Rider riding his moterbike with flames pouring out is just such cool scenes & creates such great imagery. There's some great bits in here like the police chasing Ghost Rider & he rides up a building, it's so cool & when Ghost Rider gets a mugger & literally scares him to death & lots more great fantasy moments & some Great fight scenes with Ghost Rider using his big flaming chain as a weapon. There's at times a dark atmosphere but it's all in a blockbuster fun kind of way, i see this as an Awesome summer blockbuster movie that was just very misunderstood & underrated in my opinion, put it this way i would rather watch \"Ghost Rider\" than an \"Iron-Man\" movie or a \"Captain America\" movie, nothing against those flicks as i love most of the \"MCU\" but \"Ghost Rider\" is just simply a more entertaining & enjoyable movie, in my opinion.\n\n\"GHOST RIDER\" is a pure fun, Action-packed Fantasy Thriller with Horror & western elements mixed into a big budget Summer Popcorn movie that's big on fun & full of Cool moments. Nicolas Cage is literally on Fire here in his role!!!"

But that's what they said about employee of the month, and that wasn't half bad. However, this film is bad, It's what we were told Employee of the Month would be.\n\nThe film contains numerous Clich\u00e9s, each one cheesier than the other. For the first 20 minutes I thought I was watching something that you would find on Youtube, made by American teenagers, who found their daddies video camera. The Acting is just so bad. In fact the theme of bad acting carries on through out the film, with only Nicholas Cage (Blaze) managing to give a believable performance, and then again it's not that good.\n\nThe story itself is pretty bad. A young Blaze is sitting working on his bike thinking about his ill father. Suddenly a STRANGER appears out of nowhere, telling him he will heal his father in exchange for the young boys soul, (Pedo alert). The kid obviously agrees, and signs his soul away no question asked. later on in life he realises that he is the Ghost Rider, and must defend the world from the evil BlackHeart (Wes Bentley). Whilst still trying to win back the heart of his once childhood girlfriend (Eva Mendes). Makes you want to burn the theatre just listening to it.\n\nHowever, this film does have soon (well one) good point. Now don't get excited, cause really it's not a surprise. Yes thats right, the special FX. These are very good, and are what really got me interested in the film. When I first heard of it i thought; \"How are they going to make Nicholas Cage look as if he's on fire\". Well i can tell you they did a good job. There not ground breaking, but still pretty good. Also they've done a good job on the element guys, (Earth, Water and Air). All of which are very well done. These are the reason why I give it a mid mark instead of below. I thought all of the SFX team shouldn't go unappreciated for their efforts. It's not their fault the script and acting is vile.\n\nAnyway, I'll leave you to contemplate what I've said, and make up your own mind. I don't like to influence people, but I thought I would do my bit for humanity, and save you all a bit of money. So I leave you now, goodbye. I'm off to order my tickets for 300, expect a review soon.\n\nMilligan =]"

This is not a movie to be taken seriously. It is just simple popcorn fun.\n\nNicholas Cage plays stunt motorcyclist Johnny Blaze who years ago as a teenager sold his soul to the devil in order to save his father from the cancer that was killing him. Jump to the present and we discover that the devil has come to collect on the bargain they made. You see Blackheart(Wes Bentley), who is the son of the devil, has escaped from Hell. He has come to Earth to collect a document which will give him the power to create hell on Earth. The devil of course doesn't want him to have it, and so he gets Johnny, giving him the power of the fiery Ghost Rider, to bring him back to Hell. Of course Blackheart isn't ready to go back and so a battle ensues between the two.\n\nI enjoyed the story, and enjoyed Sam Elliot in his role as a cemetery worker who tells Johnny about the curse and explains all the information we need to know. Of course Sam Elliot's character has a few secrets of his own, even though they were not really too surprising. I sort of knew where the story of Sam Elliots character was going when he first appeared on the scene. Enough of that though.\n\nGhost Rider is not the greatest comic book movie ever made. It has its flaws, but it was purely entertaining and has its place among other comic book adaptations. I would give it about the same rating as the Fantastic Four from 2005. And to those people who are trashing it, maybe you should all lighten up and enjoy the movie for what it is, a fun paced thriller that is much better than some of the lame movies I've seen so far this year. By the way, the special effects were really good too."

        "review_detailed_main": "I went into \"Ghost Rider\" with zero expectations. I was expecting some cornball, cheesy superhero movie like the \"Hulk\". I actually was surprised. It was still cheesy, but in a deliberate way. But how can it not be cheesy when you have a plot like this. It's about as unbelievably as you can get. Johnny Blaze is a motorcycle stunt rider along with his father. But when his father gets cancer, the devil comes along and makes a deal with Johnny. He will cure his father as long as Johnny sells his soul and becomes the next Ghost Rider. So he accepts. Nothing happens until many years later when the devil calls Johnny to bring back the devil's son, who has decided to go behind his father's back and take over the world. Instead, Johnny chooses to fight against both the devil and his son to rid the world forever of their evil. That's the premise, it's quite implausible, and actually, it's downright silly. Especially since the devil is just an old guy in a trench coat, and his son and his friends look like a Gothic, punk rock band.\n\nEven though the plot aspect is stupid, the rest is descent. Usually I'm not a big fan of Nicolas Cage's, but he actually did fairly well as Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider. He added some intentionally humorous scenes. The action scenes carry the film, and are what earns the positive review. Seeing the Ghost Rider ride his motorcycle up and down skyscrapers while doing battle is pretty sweet. Mostly the visual effects are good as well, but there are some scenes where all you can think is, \"What?!?!\" One scene had Nic Cage in a towel and had CG sculpted abs that looked absolutely horrible. I almost choked on my popcorn. Sam Elliot as Johnny's mentor added a certain grace to the film. He is always brilliant, and always looks like a cowboy with his huge mustache. Ironically, he is a cowboy in this film. Eva Mendes who plays Johnny's girlfriend is really bad. Fortunately, she isn't in the action scenes, so she didn't ruin those. Unlike most Marvel films, this one has some scary visuals that you should probably be aware of before you take your 8 year old along. Just a little caution for you.\n\nOtherwise, this is a great geek-out movie. People who enjoy Marvel movies or comic books are going to adore it, and others will think its garbage, and compare it to \"The Hulk\". I liked it for the most part, but still had my quibbles. \"Ghost Rider\" is mostly just mindless, fun eye-candy. It is Rated PG-13 for horror violence and disturbing images."

You think a stone would trick him). Unfortunately this Extended Cut makes this film not better, but extends the pain to watch. Ghost Rider rides with ease in my personal Top 20 of the worst movies of all time. You've been warned!"

DO NOT see this film, even for the camp value. I am extremely disappointed in Nicolas Cage - I've enjoyed a number of his movies over the years (Lord of War, Con Air, The Rock) and have come to rely on him for quality cinema.

But the devil deceives him, and Barton dies in a motorcycle accident during an exhibition. Johnny leaves the carnival, his town, his friends and his girlfriend Roxanne. Years later Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) becomes a famous motorcyclist, who risks his life in his shows, and he meets Roxanne (Eva Mendes) again, now a TV reporter. However, Mephistopheles proposes Johnny to release his contract if he become the \"Ghost Rider\" and defeat his evil son Blackheart (Wes Bentley), who wants to possess one thousand evil souls and transform hell on earth.\n\nThe comic book \"Ghost Rider\" is not released in Brazil, but the movie is entertaining and funny, with a good story based on Faust and great special effects. The fight between good and evil has a great cast, with Nicolas Cage, Peter Fonda, Sam Elliot and Eva Mendes and I have seen exactly what I expected to watch. For a Tuesday night in a movie theater, and later on DVD, this film is an excellent option. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Motoqueiro Fantasma\" (\"Ghost Rider\")"

I can't believe such movies can appear in the theaters nowadays. And finally, how come Mr. Cage plays in such a bad movie??? He is one of my favorite actors, with a lot of good titles, e. g. The Weather Man, Matchstick Men, e.t.c. So, even if you have seen these, you better re-watch them, instead of giving a try to this one. I actually watched it till the end only because I did hope that it will still get somewhere later. Believe me. It did not."

As a Marvel fan, I add that the character isn't among my favorites and I only know him for being on the cover of the first Wizard magazine. So it's a super hero whose fame is changing and I suppose the movie won't help, even thought I had fun.\n\nThe look of the ghost rider is really terrific and there aren't dull moments. I really appreciate the feeling of this road movie in the West and finally, this movie gives an excellent modernization of the western genre: the old town, the lone ranger, the bad guys, the gun fights, the horses. Everything is here but depicted in a new way and it's cool!\n\nCage is fine with his faustian character on the contrary of Eva Mendes who plays like a tart! She never convinced me one second as a poor lover! Maybe with Penelope Cruz, this movie could have been a classic!"

However, the story and villains are interesting, and although it wasn't that big of a success, I'd still recommend marvel and ghost rider fans watching it, and I'm glad Ghost Rider still had a movie.

In both good and bad ways it's a relic of a time when they still hadn't figured out how to make these so they just threw everything at the wall to see what sticks. It's a romance, a monster movie and a horror all moulded into something clearly inspired by Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films.\n\nNicolas Cage's gonzo performance and his excessively southern drawl are the biggest reason why this film is so watchable. He gives the character so many random idiosyncrasies that makes him more unique than his initially overly generic character. The villains suck and the supporting characters are thinly sketched so Cage's manic screen presence single-handedly carries this.\n\nMark Steven Johnson's direction has no authoritative style or vision but it's so scared of any scene feeling boring that there's so many different ideas thrown into the mix that it works. Christopher Young's score goes unnoticed for the most part however, it still delivers during the most important moments. It's ridiculously close to his own work on Spider-Man 3 though."

It's easy to consume, yet offers no interesting taste, gives a false sense of being full before it continues its journey and finally ends up where it belongs. Leaving no special memories or useful nutritions behind.\n\nIt's the story about how the Marvels comic book character Ghost Rider became the Ghost Rider, by selling his soul to the Devil. And how he challenges his own curse in the name of goodness. Sounds kinda cool, and should have been cool. I loved the recent movies of Batman, Spiderman, Superman and most of the rest of them. But, this one is all dumbed down for the masses, and with some totally out of place romance added so that the movie makers wont risk losing money from your girlfriend refusing to see the movie with you.\n\nYep, it's the classic money press Hollywood style movie. Take a comic book brand, mix with a famous actor, add some special effects, action and romance. Oh, and don't forget that sweet happy ending. Viola, you got yourself a safe little money machine. Only this time, it ironically lost all of its soul.\n\nAs most mainstream movie goers I like Nicholas Cage, and you will find him perform as usual. But, you will need to be less than five years old for this movie to provide any suspense or thrills. You have seen every single thing here before a million times. If you are easily amused it might give you a kick, but then again, you would probably be better off watching Tele Tubbies.\n\nThe special effects, which are the only possible reason I can think of to see the movie, are on par with what you can expect, although I was surprised to see some very poor budget movie'ish face morphing effects that gave me flashbacks from the early 90s. They wont blow you away, just barely keep you from falling asleep.\n\nTame, cowardly, boring and mostly an insult to the comic strip."

The plot was clearly not a priority, and it seems to have been overtaken by the CGI, which is successful in its attempt to adapt the comic book style to the big screen. While it never looks real (how real can a man with a flaming skull for a head look?), it's impressive, especially as computer-Cage rides down particularly tall buildings and jumps helicopters.\n\nCage, ever the over-actor, takes to his role with a typical eccentric enthusiasm that effectively sums up the spirit of Ghost Rider: sit back, switch off, and enjoy the ride."

And of course there's the stereotypical love story. There wasn't really even chemistry between the characters Johnny Blaze and Roxanne and I think the movie suffered for it. And every time Eva Mendes was on screen, every shirt she just so happened to be wearing showed a lot of cleavage but no complaints from me. The weirdest part about this movie is from the trailer is makes it seem like Nicolas Cage is totally wrong for the part and cheesy and don't forget old but surprisingly enough he does an alright job and did what he could for the role he was given. I think a lot of people are gonna compare this movie to Daredevil and say it's just as bad but for a movie about a B-list superhero that really a lot of people don't even know, it's not that bad. It kept me entertained throughout and I recommend it to anybody who likes a good cheesy superhero movie. And don't take it too serious, Ghost Rider is no Spider-Man movie."

Most just straight up hated it and think it's a poor attempt at making what could have been an incredible film. I, on the other hand rather enjoyed it. If you can get to grips with the fact that its about a man who change's into a guy with a flaming skull for a head, and the mildly humorous one liners which make the film extremely cheesy then you should enjoy it. The story line isn't up to much, and the enemies are easily defeated in what can only be described as incredibly stupid ways that make you think, \"What was the point in them?\" With that said, if you go expecting a cheesy, action packed film, which is clearly there to simply entertain you, not like some other films, which set out to lull you into thinking this could actually happen in reality for the duration of the film, then you should enjoy it. Just a few words about the storyline's inability to please many of the films critics. With 'Ghost Rider' not being a highly popular comic in the Marvel chain the story had to be improvised quite a lot. With that being said, the writers have done a fantastic job on the storyline, with plenty of action and plenty of scenes as Johnny Blaze as the Ghost Rider. Nicholas Cage (Johnny Blaze/ Ghost Rider), although not exactly challenged by this role, makes it his own and makes it as realistic as is possible for you to believe his character, who essentially is a man who becomes the Devil's Bounty Hunter by night. Finally, I come to the question is it worth going to see? Well my opinion, which is one of a person who enjoyed the film is yes go and see it on the big screen and then buy it on DVD. I know I'm going to be getting it on DVD at some point in the near future, probably on its release date. Having read this review, it is up to you weather you think it's worth going to see or just waiting for it to come out on DVD. Either way I suggest you watch it to make your own mind up about it. Don't just take the word of the people around you, from this review you should be able to realise weather you will enjoy it or weather it is not for you. Just remember...don't expect a highly intellectual film with outstanding acting performances and an incredibly believable storyline because you will come away disappointed. It is merely, in my opinion, a fun, action packed, COMIC BOOK based film, made to simply entertain."

        "review_detailed_main": "Wow this movie sucked. Seriously, the makers of this movie had so much to work with and ended up with this? This joins The Hulk(2003),and Superman II(1980) for superhero movies that can end the world, in which a super hero will not be able to save because they will be so depressed from being so badly portrayed. I honestly almost cried from anger that I payed to see a horrible film of such a high caliber.\n\nFirst off, I would like to break down why this movie was destined for greatness. The story of Ghost Rider I learned was a story that was multi dimensional, and had a dark realism that if executed right could have been made into a movie such as Batman(1989). Obviously, it was not executed properly, and the idea became a cheesy kiddie film. Marvel took an idea full of promise and flushed it down the toilet, demonstrating their lack of understanding for their own comics.\n\nThe second reason I truly hated this movie was the waste of casting for the movie. Nicholas Cage if given the right character can be very entertaining. HE WAS NOT. A glimpse of Eva Mendes can make almost any movie worth watching. NOT THIS ONE. I would hate the actors for even agreeing to make this movie, but right now I'm contemplating whether or not to sell my own soul to the devil in exchange for the destruction of MARVEL Studios. Lastly, what the hell was up with Blackheart? He was the lamest and least scariest villain I have or probably will ever see. He struck fear in no one, and his henchmen were less threatening than a hamster. Also, what was with the final showdown? I haven't been more disappointed since watching any scene from the movie Poseidon(2006).\n\nAll in all, I feel not holding back on this movie serves true justice to this creation of momentous failures. I remember trying to get into the movie so hard that I fell asleep for 15 minutes from exhaustion. When I woke up, however, I felt better for myself because I know now that in a situation of extreme measures, I can sleep through it. Friday night, Feb. 16th has been stolen from me, and I will never forgive Ghost Rider for it."

The Devil, true to his word, cures Mr.Blaze senior, who promptly snuffs it anyway when his next stunt goes horribly wrong.\n\nJohnny, now in the employ of Mephistopheles, is told that when the time comes, he will become a 'ghost rider'\u0097a bounty hunter whose job it is to collect the souls of the damned. Johnny's only hope of being released from his contract is to defeat Mephistopheles's son Blackheart (Wes Bentley), who is plotting to overthrow his father and unleash hell on earth.\n\nKnowing full well that the plot is pure nonsense, the makers of Ghost rider decide to concentrate on delivering as much fun as possible, and with a typically kooky central performance from Cage (plus able support from Eva Mendes as buxom girlfriend Roxanne, and Sam Elliot as his mentor, Carter Slade), some great special effects, and loads of comic-book action, they pretty much succeed.\n\nGhost Rider won't change your life, and it's unlikely to become your favourite film ever, but it is not a bad way to spend your time (unlike that recent Superman movie!)."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was really looking forward to Ghost Rider, not only is the character one of the most interesting out of Marvel, but the actual idea is a lot darker than your average superhero fare. For starters Ghost Rider is actually working for the devil himself, not trying to be good for the sake of it like the X-Men or Spiderman. Ghost Rider did it to save his father, only for that to go horribly wrong for him. When I first saw the trailers for Ghost Rider I thought it looked quite good, the early scenes I saw of the Ghost Rider transformation was equally as impressive. However then the critics sunk their claws into it and refused to let go. What sounded a great movie was massacred by the critics. Now I don't always pay attention to the critics, but in this case I did. I still was looking forward to it as it looked like dumb fun. Unfortunately though Ghost Rider really almost fails to reach that status. The movie is unfortunately a series of letdown only jump started here and there by the all too brief appearances of Ghost Riders itself. What could have been a classic superhero movie becomes a shambles after a while. You see the major problem with it is that simply not a lot happens. It takes forty minutes before we see the first transformation, and after that the actual sequences with the Rider are all too rare. Instead we get a mish-mash of a storyline involving Blackheart and some nonsense to do with ruling the world. It didn't really make a lot of sense so I didn't pay too much attention to it.\n\nSo where do I begin with the faults of this movie. Well for starters I'll have to rip into the dialogue and storyline. The dialogue in a superhero movie is not something I always look out for. I like it to be average, so long as the action backs it up then I'm happy enough. Unfortunately the action is all to rare to back it up, so instead we get ridiculously cheesy dialogue and a cast that have nothing to work with. Matters aren't helped by the fact the main storyline just seems bland and unoriginal as hell (no pun intended). The opening with Johnny selling his soul to Mephistopheles (or the devil as we know him), works really well. The trouble is that that storyline soon links into the stupid one involving Blackheart wanting to create hell on earth and rule the world. Anyway his storyline is a mere excuse for the Rider to hunt down Blackheart's minions and for lots of bike sequences. The storyline doesn't even try to be original, when you compare the storyline here to something more complex in X-Men 2 or even in Hulk you realise just how pathetic the storyline here is.\n\nThe cast as well unfortunately failed to make me enjoy the movie any more. Nicholas Cage does a half decent job as Johnny Blaze, I didn't think much of him in the trailers but he does quite well here. Unfortunately the script is too weak for him to be brilliant, but had the script been better he might have done a great piece of acting here. Peter Fonda as well is inspired casting as Mephistopheles, he at least makes the dialogue bearable and whenever he comes on screen the movie seems to come back to life for a brief period of time. Alas the other two main cast members, Eva Mendes and Wes Bentley are pretty much diabolical. Eva Mendes has nothing to do and no decent dialogue to work with here. But judging by the way she performs she seems pretty terrible anyway, so not much of a loss here. But Wes Bentley is just awful. His job is basically to look evil and overact. Unfortunately all he comes across as is a spoilt teenager who wants to cause daddy as much hell as possible. His villain is ineffective that anytime he is off screen is a blessing. And that is not what a villain is supposed to be like, you're supposed to want them on screen, not to want to die whenever they walk on.\n\nThankfully Ghost Rider isn't all bad as this movie obviously gets a few things right. The special effects look brilliant, whenever Johnny transforms into the Rider it looks absolutely amazing. Sequences where he rides up a skyscraper on his bike also look superb. The movies action sequences also make the movie work. Unfortunately there's a certain lack of them for me to really care that much about then. But the movie also has a sense of fun that many comic book movies lack, yes I'm talking about you Spiderman! This movie knows its not going to win Oscars, it never tries to be anything more than a piece of popcorn entertainment. And as popcorn entertainment it does ultimately work, albeit in small doses. Its bound to get all the kids excited and I'm sure that a sequel is already in the works. Its fun at times so that's why I can't completely despise it, but its got too many faults for me to really like it either.\n\nOverall Ghost Rider is one big disappointment that just redeems itself from being a bad movie by being entertaining. Unfortunately though it just scrapes average, bad storyline, bad dialogue and a lack of anything really special makes this movie forgetful. One of the weakest superhero movies to date, unfortunately in terms of quality it sits alongside movies like Elektra and Fantastic Four. The latter being more fun then both being combined however."

It takes 45 minutes to really get going, but when it does, it's awesome. The soundtrack fits in perfectly with the film and the noises are wonderful. Some may find the cackling Ghost Rider a bit cheesy and over done, but it gives it the strangely funny/evil feel that the Clown/Violater gave to the movie and comics Spawn.\n\nAnd don't listen to all the idiots in the boards bashing this movie like hell. It still is pretty good. And the CG is better then everyone gives credit for. Plus the end has a really cool Spagetti Western from Hell feel to it. All in all a great movie. Lots of fun!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay, look. I sat through both 'Electra' and 'Catwoman'. People who rate Ghost Rider a 1 out of ten need to see 'Manos: Hands of Fate' and get their scales readjusted.\n\nI am a long time fan of comics, and read mostly Marvel Comics as a kid. I actually have a reprint of the original Ghost Rider comic that I recently reread, and now I realize just how bad those 1970's comics really were. People should consider how palatable this movie is, considering its source.\n\nThings I liked about this movie: Sam Eliot; Apparently he can say anything, no matter how ludicrous, and it will sound deep and meaningful. The song 'Ghost Riders in the Sky' hyped up on heavy metal playing during the scene where the two Ghost riders ride together. The visuals; Yes indeed, a cyclist with a flaming skull for a head does indeed look just as cool as it sounds.\n\nThings I didn't like about this movie: The dialog; I have to agree that Mark Steven Johnson should work on his craft. I'm not a fan of one-liners either. Eva Mendez; I never noticed her before, but apparently, either she can't act, or MSJ can't direct.\n\nThis is not a movie of high craft. It is a fun movie though. It's not quite so bad that you have to completely leave your brain at the door, but you do have to strap on the James Bond one-liner defense guard. It is cheesy in parts. It requires a good deal of suspension of disbelief, even within its own reality, but I mean... it's a movie about a guy that somehow bursts into flames, burning away his flesh, that will later return unmarred, so maybe leaving other questions of logic behind is the best thing for all concerned.\n\nIn my opinion, it rates under Spider-Man, and X-Men, but better than the rest of Marvel's recent efforts (Daredevel, Fantastic Four, etc.)"

I enjoy Nicolas Cage and Sam Elliott a lot, but their roles were so poorly written that I wanted to leave immediately. If I had been by myself instead of with friends, I would have left.\n\nIt's bad when you find a movie funny because of how terrible it is.

The major malfunction in my opinion was how quickly Rider took out the three henchmen. The shortness of those battles were pathetic. They seriously should have lasted longer, and extended to different areas than a bog, a rooftop, and a street. There should have been more violence put into the fights. Their deaths and defeats were awesome, but the battles (or lack thereof) were pathetic. The final battle was impressive, the way they made the Legion was great.

All of the characters from hell are not so strong to make the audience surprised,especially the stupid Blackheart.The only exciting part is a scene can be seen in the Trailer:Two different generation of Ghost Rider ride together in the desert.If you want to see a film with no plot and full of meaningless SFX,this is the one!"

I was looking back and fourth from my watch several times just to make sure it was the right time because the only two choices we had were, \"Norbit and Ghost Rider.\" We should have just left right then and there; ran for our lives. Being a comic collector, I was at least a bit curious about Ghost Rider.\n\nAn hour into the movie I wanted to leave. I checked my watch and it said 4:30. I knew there were some other movies that came on at 4:30 and was tempted to sneak into one of them. Unfortunately, I decided to stick it out so as not to embarrass my friend. Looking back, I should have grabbed her and ran.\n\nThe second the movie was done, I instantly started criticizing it to no end. I don't usually do this, most of the time I just point out the good things about a show rating it by the amount of raving I do. Fueled by my latte, I expressed my opinion in full about how offended I was for having had to set through that. In the middle of naming off one of Ghost Rider's numerous flaws, I looked at my watch and stopped in my tracks...\n\nIt read 3:30...\n\nNo joke. It was ticking away perfectly fine, like nothing had happened. I tapped it a couple of times and was quite confused as to how it had set itself back two hours. Then it struck me. The movie that I had just suffered through, started at 3:30. It was as if my watch was agreeing with me. As if it were saying, \"You deserve the last two hours of you life back.\" I've heard the saying before, but this was like putting words in my mouth. I'm sure there's some kind of explanation for it, but that's not the point. The point is...\n\nEven my watch agreed that Ghost Rider was so utterly pathetic, I undoubtedly deserved the two hours I wasted watching it given back to me."

This movie has many brilliant visual effects! Including the way the Ghost Rider looks with his flaming skull and skeletal hands and when the Ghost Rider rides his flaming motorcycle at breakneck speeds leaving a trail of fire and destruction. I also liked the Ghost Rider's signature weapon, a flaming chain! It was also brilliant the way the Ghost Rider rides his flaming motorcycle across the surface of a river and up tall skyscrapers! Nicolas Cage was brilliant in his performance as Johnny Blaze, the motorcycle stunt rider who changes into the Ghost Rider. There were also two veteran actors in this film, Peter Fonda who plays Mephistopheles, and Sam Elliot who plays this mysterious \"Caretaker\". Ghost Rider's archenemy is a demon lord and the son of Satin named Blackheart played by Wesley Bentley. Another of the main cast members is Eva Mendes who plays Johnny's love interest Roxanne, and she is certainly a very beautiful actress. As I already said this movie has brilliant visual effects, but I'll admit some of the visual effects are gruesome, especially when Johnny Blaze transforms into the Ghost Rider for the first time. I like other supernatural antiheroes like Spawn and Hellboy, but I think Ghost Rider is the ultimate supernatural antihero! So if you like comic book antiheroes then I highly recommend that you see this movie!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Having seen this film, I must say it's probably not the best Marvel film, not even close but when you look at the others, there's one thing fans should draw into perspective: Previous Marvel films like Fantastic 4, Daredevil, the Punisher and now Spider-man 3 all did bad(not putting the box office inconsideration) due to the fact that they tried to be too serious and spun out of control turning every moment in the film into something cheesy, unfunny, unrealistic and unnecessary which made those films do bad and not succeed viewer's expectations. This film did the opposite, it was intentional with the cheesiness, unrealism, and humor and in my opinion portioned it out well, so it wasn't over the top much like those other films. It also was more controlled and stayed in its limitations and didn't make a running gag go to long to the point it was lame or embarrassing to watch like those other films did, such as spider-man 3, with spider-man dancing in the streets or Fantastic four having Johnny Storm doing bike tricks at a stadium and coming up with the groups names - very unconvincingly; Doctor Doom with his one liners and Daredevil with Matt Murdock's unrealistic montage.\n\nWhy else do you think with the Ghost rider film, they created new villains (aka the fallen) instead of doing what every other marvel film did and take them out of the comics to draw in more fans? Because it's not suppose to be taken so seriously and its not suppose to be 100% based off the comics. They don't want to waste fans' times with big villains like sandman and venom just popping up for no reason and doing barely anything to the storyline.\n\nIn my opinion the whole purpose to the film was to see a skeleton on fire fighting demons and riding his motorbike, why do you think they delayed the film from 2006 to 2007? So Ghost rider would look great on the big screen, not so the story could be developed better or the acting be improved. Your not paying money for good acting or a great storyline your paying to see exactly what the title advertise's and if your not happy then you shouldn't of ever assumed in the first place such an unimaginable thing could be a realistic very well made blockbuster like Little Miss Sunshine (odd comparison, I know) or the Matrix or batman begins(not realistic but was as realistic as you could get a character like that to be)\n\nSo see this film for what the title actually advertise's and not for what you'd expect it to be."

Nic Cage, whom I have grown to really love as an actor, seem completely out of place here. I don't know if it was his bad hair, bad chemistry or his bad Elvis impersonation, but he did not sell this role for me.\n\nEva Mendes, great too look at and in the right role can really deliver a good performance. She has nothing to really do here except be what I have already \"pointed\", hehe, get it, out to you. Cleavage. I don't know if 'respected' reporters where those types of shirts, but I was distracted every time she was on screen.\n\nThe supporting cast, which includes Peter Fonda, Donal Logue and the weird plastic bag kid from American Beauty (just kidding, Wes Bently) ham it up. The big villain in this film is a kid that I do not find evil or intimidating. Fonda merely walks around the scenes and never does anything of interest and Logue has too few scenes to really even mention. Don't get me started on Sam Elliott. Here's a guy whose big scene had me pumped, then left me with a sour taste in my mouth after he merely walks away during the big climax.\n\nThe Ghost Rider effects are neat, but the bad guys were hokey. Earth, wind and water? The way people died was laughable too. We know that the relatively not so popular comic book characters can really be good films, this one missed the boat."

        "review_detailed_main": "Did Mark Steven Johnson know what he was doing with Ghost Rider? More than anyone else, I'd figure. Yet it would be probably just as funny as the movie itself to see him try and work legitimate claims to big-action movie clout with this one. It makes Daredevil look classy in comparison, but in a way it's actually better than Daredevil in the point that matters- where Daredevil was just run of the mill, Ghost Rider is a horrendous exercise in the ludicrous in special effects, stunts, cheesy-bread dialog (look how far it stretches!), and Nicholas Cage's ultimate decline as an actor. By this account I shouldn't recommend, but...damn it all if it isn't worth seeing once; it's like a disposable item bought from a mall that works great once in the worst possible ways, and then probably never will again. Unlike some of the bad movies from last year (i.e. Apocalypto, Lady in the Water), it doesn't totally offend the sensibilities even through its numerous faults. Actually, a part of me WAS offended, as I thought seeing it 'this is what action movies based on comic books have come to, good Lord', but the other part of me, that was expecting it to be bad, had a lot of fun in savoring every trashy, campy, whatever-the-f*** moment.\n\nAnd how about Nicolas Cage, huh? Summoned from the spotty parts he's gone to in the dozen years since he nabbed an Oscar, he plays Johnny Blaze, a character who might be one of the dumbest characters in modern movies, and who's motivations amount to 'I love to ride, I love my girl from my teenage years, and I hate the son of Satan (played by Wes Bentley, who's another sign of the decline of the American Beauty kids), and I got to lift the curse from Mephastopheles'. So, he's turned into the Ghost Rider, a creation of visual effects and cheesy grit that COULD actually be a legitimate marvel, but ends up being better for laughs, all unintentional I'd guess. But all the while though- and I might actually give credit to the filmmaker and star(s) for this- they don't make it necessarily a dull-bad movie. Few things get more entertaining than seeing how Ghost Rider vanquishes with his fiery whip his un-dead foes, including one who is made of wind! Or just the appearances of Peter Fonda and Sam Elliot, actors who might've been amazing at one time or another, but now seem like extreme caricatures (I was almost expecting Big Lebowski quotes in the dialog/voice-overs of Elliot's). And Eva Mendes becomes almost a counterpoint for Cage's plastic, trying-to-break-cardboard performance.\n\nBut there's a lot of great lines to go with the wacky visuals too, as the inanities of style and substance start to go hand in hand (i.e. the cops just seem to know without much evidence that Johnny Blaze is responsible for the first set of crimes when he becomes Ghost Rider the first time, or when Ghost Rider rides up the side of a building). And by the end, my friends and I couldn't help ourselves, and went full-blown into what had already been happening for a while watching the flick- we became like the characters of Mystery Science Theater 3000, making wisecracks at every turn when not busting a gut over Bentley's turn into being \"Legion...We are MANY!\". The material just lends itself completely to that kind of deconstruction, yet that's what ends up making it not a complete waste of celluloid at the same time. Well, some would argue it is a waste, and they might not be wrong, but what a waste! It's probably up there in the ranks of the most shamelessly entertaining train-wreck Hollywood spectacles, right up there with the likes of Howard the Duck and Zardoz. Just don't, for goodness sakes, expect a respectable adaptation from original source to screen."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ever since the release of Bryan Singer's \"X-Men\", movie based on Marvel Comics' popular superhero team, the first decade of the 2000s saw a revival of films based on the adventures of comic book heroes even bigger to what Donner's \"Superman\" did in the late 70s, and Burton's \"Batman\" in the late 80s. After \"X-Men\" came \"Spider-Man\", \"The Hulk\" and many other classic names of the main comic book pantheons (even the Batman franchise got a reboot) as modern technology made possible what in the past years was impossible: to represent the fantastic abilities of the characters in a somewhat realistic way. After more than 6 six years of troubled development (it was one of the first to be announced), the supernatural hero created in the 70s by Gary Friedrich and Mike Ploog, \"Ghost Rider\", has now joined the ranks of superheroes with a movie adaptation.\n\nThe movie is the story of Johnny Blaze (Matt Long), the son of a stunt motorcycle rider (Brett Cullen) who one day discovers that his father is dying of cancer. On that day the demon Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) appears to him, and offers Johnny the chance to save his father if he is willing to give him his soul. Blaze sings the contract and his father gets cured, but later gets killed on a motorcycle accident, making Johnny's soul the Devil's property, and he'll find a use for him someday. Many years later, Johnny (Nicolas Cage) is now a famous stunt driver, and is in this way where he gets reunited to the girlfriend he abandoned as a teenager, Roxanne (Eva Mendes). However, the Devil also returns to Johnny's life and forces him to become his warrior, the Ghost Rider, as he needs him to kill his son Blackheart (Wes Bentley), who plans to overpower him.\n\nWritten and directed by Mark Steven Johnson (who previously worked on \"Daredevil\"), \"Ghost Rider\" is essentially, a movie to spent the time and have some fun. This is not a movie that explores the complexities of its hero, but one that seems to celebrate the fun and entertainment that comic book superheroes represent. Unlike what one would expect of a title like \"Ghost Rider\" (and its themes of demons and ghosts), Johnson makes a story that owes more to adventure comic books and the Western serials of old than to the Faust myth, as he adds a good dose of tongue-in-cheek humor that lightens up things a lot. Johnson truly captures the feeling of a comic book in his story, but sadly it also carries the problems that this kind of stories have, like for example a very shallow characterization, several underdeveloped subplots, and a predictable and clich\u00e9d plot.\n\nNow, while Johnson's work as a writer is average at best, he fares a tad better as a director, as he manages to bring to life his comic book adventure with all the wry humor and action he put on paper. As written above, Johnson's movie owes a lot to Western serials and pulp fiction, and this carries out to the visual style too, as even it makes a big nod to the Phantom Rider, the classic Western character that originated \"Ghost Rider\". Since the main character is literally a living skull on fire, the special effects had to be excellent, and fortunately, they are the best part of the film, as their creation of the rider and his fire is simply outstanding. Sadly, a movie can't be completely about special effects, and to his great misfortune, Johnson's skill as a director of real life actors are considerably inferior to his skill at making great visuals.\n\nNicolas Cage is surprisingly effective as Johnny Blaze (an improvement over his disastrous performance in the remake of \"The Wicker Man\"), and against all odds makes a convincing tortured antihero with a very black humor. Peter Fonda and Donal Logue are also pretty good in their small roles, although the real highlight of the film is Sam Elliott, who plays the mysterious Caretaker of the local cemetery. They all make great jobs in their arguably underwritten characters, but sadly, the film is also plagued by awful performances, starting with the one given by Eva Mendes, whom at best feels severely out of place, and at worst looks like an amateur trying to act. Definitely not her best moment. The other cast member who brings the movie down is sadly Wes Bentley, who not only isn't remotely memorable as the main villain, but also overacts to the point of ridicule.\n\nWhile certainly the bad performance of some cast members hurt the film a lot, it must be said that there really wasn't a lot for them to work with, because as written above, the writing isn't exactly the best material and no matter how good one actor is, the quality of the script will play a major role in the final output. This is specially obvious in the way Johnson fleshed out his villains, as if some characters are insipid, the villains here are dull, uninspired and serve no other purpose that to let the hero show off how amazing he is. A good villain has a definite personality and in \"Ghost Rider\" they only exist to look good, and that's a real damage to the movie, as there's never a real sense of danger with such weak counterparts for the hero. The complete opposite are Fonda and Elliott's characters, whom are easily the best thing about the film.\n\nDespite all its flaws, I enjoyed \"Ghost Rider\" for what it was: an action movie with a touch of the Western genre meant to translate the fun and entertainment of comic book adventures to film. I probably liked it more that I should have, but that's mainly because while it certainly lacks a lot of quality, it had a lot of heart, and sometimes that's all that matters. Not a particularly good movie, but it is a good ride. 6/10"

When a motorcycle-riding stuntman offers his soul to Mephistopheles in order to save the life of the one he loves most, he is forced to play host to a powerful supernatural entity whose flaming skull visage strikes fear into the heart of his enemies in this feature-film version of the long-running comic series. By day, Johnny Blaze (actor and comic- book devotee Nicolas Cage) is one of the world's best-known stuntmen, but when the sun goes down and he is in the presence of evil, the death- defying daredevil bursts into flames to become the indestructible, motorcycle-riding antihero known to the world as the Ghost Rider. ( Jason Buchanan, Rovi) So Nicholas Cage can sometimes be good in a movie. And other times he can be awful. In this movie, he falls under the latter. Everyone in this is AWFUL!!!!!! Eva Mendes, well I'll give her a pass because I wasn't paying attention to her acting but everyone else is so dull, flat, and lifeless. You would think goddamn George Lucas directed this movie. The plot doesn't fare any better I might add. The villains are more of a laughing stock than a threat, and the main baddie Blackheart does nothing but act all emo and be all like \"I'm gonna destroy the world cause I got daddy issues\". The action scenes are mundane, and flat out just not interesting as well. Just like the rest of the movie I might add. And you know what is even more surprising: They made a sequel to this! And it is somehow even worse."

One thing, this is not a kid film like spider-man or superman which means that the director can create violence and scary scenes. There are some suspense but the director made a fool out of it and it turned out not scaring people. The director did a good job on making ghost rider to live. But bad job on finding the actor of ghost rider, he looks to old to be a handsome superhero. The director had learnt his lesson, deciding to make it more thrilling than daredevil. It lacks the violence that was needed. If ghost rider was so capable of killing the bad guy in around five minutes, why not put him into a fight with the devil who caused him so much pain. Ghost rider may not be very good but at least it proved that the director put in more effort than the crap daredevil."

Nic Cage, an actor of limited ability with a propensity for wearing ill-fitting wigs, in an effects-heavy adaptation of a lesser-known comic-book character. Early indications gave me no reason to hope for anything better but then, after half-an-hour or so of fairly clunky exposition something strange started to happen: it started to be fun\u0085\n\nMake no bones about it, this isn't a well made film but, like all good films that know that they're bad, it doesn't worry too much about pleasing those looking for polished performances, meaningful dialogue and semiotics. In fact, like a hairy biker gunning his engine, it raises a finger at all those with lofty expectations and goes its own delirious way. This is a film about a skeleton with its head on fire, after all.\n\nCage gives exactly the same performance he has given in every film he has ever made. His syrup sits atop his head like a fat lazy spider dreaming of the time it spied its soul mate perched atop Elton John's dome. Its difficult to be sure whether Cage is trying to play it straight in order to raise laughs or not \u0096 perhaps he didn't even know himself. Perhaps director Johnson told him to play it straight knowing it was a sure way of winning laughs. Either way, Cage is at his least irritating here. Eva Mendes doesn't have much to do but looks delicious doing it in a succession of tight-fitting outfits. Peter Fonda makes one of film history's more insipid Satans, while the guy who plays his errant son fares little better. Sam Elliott plays the crusty caretaker of a cemetery who appears to be based on Clint Eastwood's western characters and shares an exhilarating night-time race across the desert with the Ghost Rider to the strains of Ghost Riders in the Sky.\n\nThis is one of those films that wants you to crack open a beer, kick back, and empty your brain before the opening credits end. Watch it on its own terms and you're sure to have a blast."

This movie tried to give a logical explanation for how the contracts worked, but I never fully understood what made this different from any other deal with the devil (or Mephistopheles, if you prefer.) I also didn't know why the demons were bickering with one another to the point that one created the Ghost Rider in order to hunt down the other. That's not even addressing the fact that, if Mephistopheles had the power to create these Ghost Riders, why did he need them to do his work for him? But let's pretend the nonsense worked. Even forgiving all that, the anti-hero known as Ghost Rider would still bug me because he has a problem that has always annoyed me in superhero movies...no defined weakness. When he's fighting it's hard to tell when or if something is hurting him, and I have no way of knowing if his \"life\" is in danger. The demons have a similar problem, so all around the fighting loses me because I don't know who's dominating and who's losing aside from their physical body language.\n\nAs for the human story that plays alongside the supernatural one, well it's a bit weak. I kind of like the craziness that Nicolas Cage brings to the role, because he is the kind of guy you could see taking insane risks with his life. However, his romance with Eva Mendes falls flat since the two have no chemistry. Also, they don't have a full story arc because the Ghost Rider stuff keeps getting in the way, and they end up resolving it without really addressing the underlying problem in their relationship. I did love what Sam Elliott brought to the film. He is an ideal actor to play the mentor in any movie, and he has a swagger that fits with the backstory we learn about his character. The CGI effects weren't always great, but I feel like they embraced their limitations. They allowed Ghost Rider to be this ridiculous thing exactly as he's depicted in the comics, and his penance stare was a delightfully wacky effect. I will say that I found it a bit tedious that they kept introducing pieces of Ghost Rider's costume from the comics one bit at a time. It almost became laughable how the movie would stop so he could put some spikes on his jacket or throw a chain on his chest. But overall, I think Ghost Rider is an average superhero film, that is perhaps a bit more enjoyable if you laugh at some of its ridiculousness rather than take it as a serious story."

The special effects were excellent and they took obvious pains to bring the Ghost Rider character to life with CG. The transformation scenes were quite intense early on and parents might want to consider this could be disturbing for younger children(lots of agonized yelling w/up close face shots of NC).\n\nThe back-story of the previous Ghost Rider(s) felt like it needed more fleshing out to give a complete story but did an adequate job (if you aren't late and don't know the story, you won't be confused.) Action wise, the fight sequences felt rushed and there was little tension/apprehension that Ghost Rider might fail in his early encounters.\n\nAll in all, a pretty good action flick and not a debacle that some of the comic book conversions have been.\n\nKraki"

Nicholas Cage has been slumpin: Weather Man, Wicker Man, this movie, Adaptation. Out with the old timers and in with the new actors.

It balances humor and horror and adventure in a way that I haven't seen since Army of Darkness, the 3rd in the Evil Dead Trilogy. Nicolas Cage is hilarious. He has a face that is like a silent movie actors and I kept thinking about movies like Nosferatu or Phantom of the Opera. He's been waiting for years to play this role and you can really feel how much fun he's having just going crazy, especially in the first scene when Johnny Blaze turns into the Ghost Rider. The movie just borders on the edge of campy but always manages to pull itself back before going to far. And Sam Elliott. It's got Sam Elliot. What more could you ask for?"

        "review_detailed_main": "The first time I watched this film, I thought it was OK. However, after many viewings I have come to embrace the film a lot more.\n\nEverything from the villains, the plot and the sets are over the top, but what should we expect from a film based on a character that has a flaming skull of a head? I mean come on, this is not high art. It is an opportunity to stretch and have some fun. Cage does so in spades and gives us a modern Texas cowboy.\n\nAs with Dare Devil, Johnson knows the material but is not so much of a fan boy that he doesn't miss the opportunities to take an already absurd story and treat it too serious. Johnson has tackled two of the more dark comics in the Marvel catalog, but he has a touch I appreciate which is respect but not so much that it becomes blind reverence. I know, I know, comics are the modern day lore and myth. But they are not so steeped in lore and myth that their intent should be missed and that is to take reality and stretch it.\n\nI absolutely love the settings that Johnson uses, at times this feels like a modern day spaghetti western. Were it me, I would have kept the story strictly in the desert. But that would bely the setting of the comics. As is, we get a really cool story told in two worlds.\n\nSam Elliot is the man plain and simple. His Caretaker is the grounding element of the movie, the anchor. Fonda's take on the devil is both inspired and genius. He gives the \"red one\" a much needed makeover and I love watching Fonda chew up the scenery when he is on. He is over the top and under the table, all in the same scene. I love that.\n\nEva Mendes comes off as pretty much window dressing, which is what the comics usually do with their female characters. I don't fault Johnson here, but would have liked a little more substance than boobs from Mendes.\n\nAll in all, gets better with every viewing."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film was never going to be a masterpiece in comic-book adaptation. Where other Marvel-based movies (Spider-Man, X-Men etc.) focused on their protagonists'inner struggles, it was clear from the earliest teaser that Ghost Rider had no such ambitions; it was just going to be a loud, hopefully watchable action movie. And that's exactly what it is.\n\nHowever, writer/director Mark Steven Johnson (who previously explored comic-book territory in the flawed, but somehow underrated Daredevil) deserves credit for trying to provide us with a believable back-story for this unusual character. Shame it's all stuff we've seen before (an unbearable loss and its life-altering consequences), the only variation being the contract young Johnny Blaze signs with Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) to save Blaze Sr. 's life. Predictably, the old man dies anyway, leaving Johnny (Nicolas Cage) alone and forced to serve the dark forces: by day, he's an ordinary man who earns his living by impressing people with his motorcycle stunts; by night, on the other hand, he becomes the Ghost Rider, an avenger who punishes evildoers by making them feel the same pain they have inflicted upon their victims. Naturally, his nocturnal persona isn't the kind of guy who walks unnoticed (how could he, his face being a flaming skull?), and so he will also have to deal with the authorities. Oh, and then there's Blackheart (Wes Bentley), a rogue demon who's trying to take over the world. You know, business as usual.\n\nKnowing that any psychological digressions would be a waste of time, Johnson puts all his energy into the action sequences, and that's where the film truly succeeds: whenever the Rider gets on the motorbike and starts causing all kinds of mayhem, it's easy to see why comic-book readers are fascinated by a character who, unlike Spidey and friends, isn't afraid to get his hands dirty, no matter what (including a skyscraper) comes in his way. Ghost Rider is an uncompromising bad-ass, and Cage has a lot of fun playing him, although even he struggles to keep a straight face while delivering the line \"I sold my soul to the Devil\". And speaking of devils, the villains are actually the main reason the film occasionally clunks: while the riotous Fonda is a joy to watch (the Easy Rider in-joke being the stand-out), the same can't be said of Bentley, who swaps the chilling subtlety he mastered in American Beauty for stereotyped overacting (but then again, what else can you do when you've got the most ridiculous lines and sidekicks since Batman & Robin?). Another weak element, though not as dull as Bentley, is the romantic subplot involving Eva Mendes, primarily because even the most inexperienced moviegoer is able to guess the outcome.\n\nFinal verdict? Well, romance and bad guys aside, Ghost Rider is fun, especially when the titular character is let loose in the second half of the film. Certainly not among the year's best movies, but worth a look on your average Saturday night.\n\n6,5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I'll say this right from the start: Ghost Rider is in no way, shape or form a great motion picture. Still, I enjoyed it. I find that sometimes movies call for different approaches. Sometimes you have to take them for what they are, and this can help enhance the viewing experience. Case in point, I was not expecting much from Ghost Rider. I could tell from the trailers that it wasn't exactly going to be a masterpiece, but still I was hoping to find some redeeming qualities and I did.\n\nAs others have suggested, the acting is a bit iffy at best. Personally, I quite enjoyed Nicholas Cage as Johnny Blaze. He brings a sense of discovery to the role that works well. I also liked Peter Fonda as Mephistopheles. Yes, he's very understated and people have said that he seems bored, but honestly it worked for me because he comes off as a very cool customer and who's cooler than the devil himself? I'll also give props to Sam Elliott, who by this point is one of those actors who I think can do no wrong. It probably doesn't hurt that he basically plays the same character in every movie, but that's a moot point. On the other end of the spectrum, I was a bit disappointed with the casting of Wes Bentley. He just lacked any real menace. If it weren't for the CGI fangs they randomly added, I don't think there'd be much to fear at all. Likewise, Eva Mendes just seemed out of place. Don't get me wrong, she's a beautiful girl and her wardrobe throughout the film is certainly great (let's just say that her \"girls\" steal almost every scene she's in) but her acting chops aren't nearly as great as her cleavage.\n\nAll this aside, I don't think most people go to a comic book movie hoping for Oscar-caliber performances. They go to have a good time, and in this regard I think Ghost Rider delivers. After all, it's a movie that rather prominently features a flaming biker skeleton riding a demon motorcycle. If that's not cool, I don't know what is."

        "review_detailed_main": "The latest effort from Marvel and Daredevil director Mark Steven Johnson is a loud and messy film that, whilst it has some merit, has too many flaws that weigh it down. Nicholas Cage plays Johnny Storm, a stunt rider who, as a child, makes a deal with the devil (Fonda) to save his father's life. Later on in life he must uphold his end of the deal \u0096 he must become the next Ghost Rider, acting as the devil's bounty hunter to rid the world of Blackheart, the devil's son, who has just returned to take over the world.\n\nCage is clearly enjoying himself as the oddball Storm \u0096 laughing at chimpanzee kung-fu and drinking jelly beans from a cocktail glass is his natural way of life \u0096 as he should be given he is a life-long fan of the comic book this is based on. However, the other cast members don't quite fit in: Peter Fonda and Sam Elliott (as a graveyard caretaker who acts as a mentor to Storm) both seem to be acting in a far more serious film; Eva Mendes is obligingly cute but does nothing other than pose as background scenery as Storm's childhood girlfriend; Donal Logue provides comical side-kick responsibilities in the same way that Jon Favreau did for Daredevil; and Wes Bentley brings as much menace to the film as an Andrex puppy.\n\nIn fact, the villains are all non-threatening and highly non-entertaining. When they are on screen the film stalls, and given that Blackheart is the reason for the Ghost Rider's existence that means the film stalls too often. Blackheart just comes across as camp, whilst his potentially cool and evil henchmen merely provide more imaginative ways to die. The films best bits don't involve the villains \u0096 Ghost Rider outrunning the entire Boston police force on his flamed-out motorbike is a highlight \u0096 and when Cage gets to be cut loose the film picks up. Also on the plus side, the effect of Ghost Rider, with his flaming skull, looks amazing, and the effects of CGI flames have been pushed to a new level. Sadly though, the rest of the effects are lacking and, come the finale, are reaching into Van Helsing territory \u0096 too many effects that are not developed enough to convince. Storm's transformation in the Ghost Rider is meant to emulate the pain from An American Werewolf in London, and the first transformation does, but after that Storm changes instantly and without any effect on him; we are not given the rules that define the Ghost Rider's world, and a lack of consistency is clearly noticeable.\n\nDesigned to be simple popcorn entertainment, Ghost Rider simply isn't as much fun as it should be. It has too many elements that quite simply do not work, making it a loud noise of a film that does not belong with other Marvel films of far superior quality.\n\nRated: 5/10\n\nMore reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net"

It means that they are not properly introduced by the scriptwriter and we only know the characters from his name. I mean you should be able to let your audience know your characters without mentioning his/her name and that's what i called a \"Story\" Last, people create movie to entertain people. Some audience do not like to think much so you must be able to give what the audience want without involving them to think. \"Ghost Rider\" does not have that. Besides the strange characters name and also the improper beginning of the movie.\n\nI hope Marvel can create more exciting story for all generations, can't wait for the next fantastic four movie."

There are many reasons that we choose to watch a film, and for the most part we have somewhat of an idea of what to expect prior to actually watching it. If you are looking for a film that is unique and is of great quality, in acting and in plot, put this back on the shelf. If you are just in the mood for some action, and a bit of entertainment, this film in right down your alley. In all, Ghost Rider has received both positive and negative reviews, and I can see why. What you need to ask yourself, is are you in the mood for an experience, or just entertainment?"

Please watch this movie for a textbook on how to make that idea boring.\n\nI liked most of the other comic book movies that came out: the Spiderman flicks ruled. Blade (the first one at least) ruled. Batman Begins was cool. I don't know what the problem with this movie is. No plot? Crappy dialog? Boring characters? There are some good ideas here, like Johnny not knowing if it is his skill that protects him, or his deal with you-know-who, but these are missed opportunities, far outweighed by boring crap. Actually, the part of the movie BEFORE ghost rider appears is much more interesting than the latter parts. Maybe because they were focusing on the characters and not the demonic effects.\n\nLike corn? You'll get a lot of that here. The speech he gives at the end is terrible. Movies based on comics don't have to be like this. Spiderman has a heroic motivation, but he doesn't make a speech about it at the end of his movies.\n\nYes, Ghostrider's cg looks cool. It just needed a cool script to go along with it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ghost Rider - I didn't expect anything at all from this Marvel film after reading it's awful reviews. But I really still wanted to check it out - you know, to see what I think.?\n\nThe very start of the movie with the narrating & the explaining of the Ghost Rider, is amazing & well-done. Really reassures you that the critics may have been wrong. But what follows for the 15 minutes following the introduction is ridiculous. Badly acted. Rushed. Script completely all over the place. The meet with the devil could've been done much better. But still - not boring.?\n\nWhen we see a few years into the future though, the movie steadily begins to please, not very much but still MUCH better acting & script. Proof that Nicholas Cage & Eva Mendes are much better actors than the younger actors of the characters.?\n\nThe films peak is in the middle - the character actually being the Ghost Rider scenes. Really keeps you on the edge of your seat. Perhaps only because I'm a wimp - but I actually got really scared during some scenes. During the middle of the film you begin to forget the start's flaws & the reviews.?\n\nJust as the film got into it - the end came. An end just as bad as the start. A showdown which bores & is completely predictable. A cheesy & badly scripted couple of scenes which make you leave the cinema feeling 'Blah'. ?\n\nAll in all - a good movie, which doesn't have average scenes, but great scenes & awful scenes. Would I see it again? Not for a few years, but possibly eventually. Who do I recommend it to? Fans of movies like Hellboy, Van Helsing & Daredevil - nowhere near as good as those 3 though.?\n\nIt was still a fun & thrilling ride, I recommend to anyone looking for a fun action flick."

I'm serious about this, i couldn't believed my eyes when i was seeing this crap. the 1 star is for serious also. I was expecting a mediocre but fun movie, it was insanely worse than that. And OMG, the amount of clich\u00e9s were just too many, to predictable and boring, i thought Cage would had do a great job, being him a great fan of the comics, i guess he's crying in pain after seeing this piece of ****.

( MUCH BETTER than x-men 3 and the HULK )\n\nThis is a good movie i would recommend to anyone to go see with some friends, just to have a good time. It has a good flow, the depth of the story is good, and the action is well done.\n\nI would like to see a sequel, which obviously will happen with the great opening it has had. I just hope they spend just a little more time with the villains, and a tighter storyline."

        "review_detailed_main": "This turd was served unto me thanks to my 13 yr old. I expected an evening reminiscent of Chuck E Cheese birthdays parties- you suffer through it for the kid, but if a little creative, you can find ways to enjoy yourself. Its for the kiddo, fine. We pay the fees. We sit. We chat and laugh. Time well spent with my offspring.... and then this turd falls into our lap and something that can only be described as torture began.\n\nWe stayed. We persevered. We have overcome. However, this film adds yet another nail into the coffin of our society. The idea that there a significant percentage of people who enjoyed this movie scares me. They \"thought\" it was great. There is a reason why this movie was made. There is a reason why there is a mile of cleavage 4\" per frame. There is a reason Peter Fonda cameoed (which was a most unexpected irony). There is a reason that any depth or substance was removed and replaced with flames, explosions, cheesy graphics/effects, 200 C/D cup extras in tight low cut shirts, and the underlying theme of this stool sample. it was as if the creators intentionally attempt to hypnotize you with the sub-par special effects. Its as if the creators were making a film for a nation of testosterone fueled high school quarterbacks that live in the projects. I can just picture the campus military recruiter taking his prey out to see this on a Friday night. WHOA!! that was Awesome!!.... well that is kinda dumb, Why is th... WHOA!! Did you see those t!ts?!!.... HM...DAMN!!! did you see that Harley? WOW!!!\" The military needs a few good men just like you boys. I got up to leave and as we were walking out, the helicopters were flying into the stadium. It was too much. I stood in awe and found myself to mesmerized. \"Are they f*cking serious??\" It was over the top and like a toothache, I couldn't leave it alone. We stayed just to see how far this would be taken. With the country being at \"war\", you have to expect Hollywood to step up and provide plenty of \"feel good\" movies for family members and even more Gun-ho movies to inspire future recruits. It's become so commonplace that subtle isn't even necessary. Apparently, neither is depth or intelligence. Edward Bernays would be proud. As a matter of fact, this is EXACTLY what Bernays would do. Unjustified and unsupported war that the country cannot back out of.... in fact it requires more support... HM... let's see- people are stupid and they are dangerous in masses. Aha! Solution- use emotion. Use the media. Make retarded films for retarded masses and then stir up their emotions. Irrational and emotional are keys to control. I really wish people would wake up. Watch the ending as the \"hero\" denies his personal life and his love so that he may go fight crime and somehow spite Mephisto for killing his father. The World Trade Center should have been in the background with some firefighters logo fading out with a transparent flag slowing flowing in the wind.... This film IS the dumbing down of our society. This is the catalyst for our retardation. This type of \"entertainment\" along with video games are crucial right now. This is the realization I have come to from reading and learning history. This film appears to be made at the request of the DOD or least partially financed by them. The Nazi's weren't the only ones with propaganda, nor were they the best at it...\n\nIt will be a long time before I return to the theater because of this film. If by some remote chance, I am blowing this out of proportion and simply being paranoid- then it will get better. Soon our troops will be home and Hollywood will go back to making decent films. If not, it is only going to get worse as the entropy increases and more aggressive measures are taken. BTW- Frank Miller's \"300\" (a glorious and heroic depiction of Sparta) is coming soon to theater near you... uh oh."

        "review_detailed_main": "ANOTHER BELOVED HERO SHREDDED Hulk, Daredevil, Electra, and now \"Ghost Rider\"...the list, unfortunately, is liable to lengthen. All of these beloved characters could have been delivered to the movie-going public with as much, if not more, success than Spiderman. Alas, it was not to be... It seems that those who take it upon themselves to bring these characters to cinematic life choose instead to serve a kind of fast-food product to the hopeful, who are destined to be woefully disappointed if searching for some real fiber and sustenance among these flash-fried concoctions forced upon them. They can only watch in utter grief and dismay from their high-dollar theater seat as a hero they had likely grown up admiring is sliced and diced by over-dependence on CGI, paper-thin character development, wooden performances, and a lukewarm, sometimes confusing plot.\n\nSERVE UP CRAP, THEN FUGEDABOUDIT These movie-makers know it is a sure bet that a comic book character will draw a faithful audience...at least for a first installment. It seems this is often all they're actually shooting for. The all-too-familiar specter of entrepreneurial timidity seems to engulf whatever possibilities for success such projects might have held. Of course, big money, as well as reputation among one's Hollywood peers is on the line, so formulaic plot and CGI razzle-dazzle rule the day, and squashes any chance that this character might once again appear upon the silver screen. Batman, thankfully, is a notable exception. Dast we hope that this same phoenix-like rebirth will save some of the aforementioned characters? I hope so. I still have some hope for Electra. I dig kick-a** women.\n\nWRITERS, DO YOUR $%#@& JOBS!\n\nWHERE'S YOUR ADAPTIVE GENIUS? To be fair, I do acknowledge that when Stan Lee created these characters, he had high hopes only for a successful comic, not a movie. Also, certain aspects of a character might have worked well back in the 60's, 70's, etc., but not necessarily in 2007. But this is a perfect opportunity for writers to let their true genius shine, and for directors and producers to exercise some trust in the vision and commercial adaptability of their writers. It seems the writers of the \"Ghost Rider\" screenplay were heavily dependent upon the years of monthly comic book issues of \"Ghost Rider\" to develop the characters. Uh-uh, guys. Remember, some in your audience may not be comic book fans. Development is YOUR job, and you have 114 minutes to do it...but it can be done. Heck, I could have done it. I wish...\n\nCAGE, WERE YOU HIGH?\n\nEVA MENDEZ: PRETTY, HISPANIC, EXPLOITABLE; ZERO TALENT\n\nConsequently, not all aspects of a character, regardless of any digital magic, will transfer readily into a movie. This requires some tinkering, which carries the risk of alienating a character's fan base. However, TOTAL lack of character development is inexcusable. Wooden performances and characterization on the part of the actor?...off with their heads!(for wood, check out the scene where Cage is pointing and laughing at the television, until Mack changes the channel...).\n\nEva Mendez is surely a better actor than the one I saw in \"Ghost Rider\"...my gosh, has the marketing machine sunk THIS LOW in attempting to rope in the Hispanic movie-going public? Check out the scene where she jumps out of the van when Cage's character blocks their passage with his bike...uhhh. She was just repeating lines and posing (...and posing), that's all...Eva Mendez portraying an actor, and badly, at that. But hey, she's a lovely hispan-magnet, right?\n\nThe graying couple sitting next to me in the theater while watching this turkey were surely thinking the same thing I was as they shifted incessantly in their seats-WHEN IS THIS STINKER GOING TO END? I'VE PAID FOR IT...MIGHT AS WELL ENDURE TILL THE END... I almost just walked out.\n\nThe writers could have made G.R. much darker...far more mysterious, and therefore far more substantial. All this could have been done without losing the PG rating, and a younger audience. They could have upheld what seemed to have been an effort to downplay, though not eliminate, the Satanic stuff. However, the writers tried to straddle the line between campy, and darkness, exposing (forgive me..)their tiny little creative balls! Sometimes, a character's very nature makes it difficult to write him/her seriously...take werewolves, for example. Think Frankenstein, in the \"Van Helsing\" travesty. Now consider a character with a flaming skull for a head, riding a flaming chopper. He could have been painted as a joke, or as a tormented monster, with a penchant for doing good. In \"Ghost Rider\", he was just painted, \"blah\". Writers, I want your pens on my desk...NOW! YOU'RE THROUGH!\n\nIF THE LIGHTS FLICKER, SATAN'S HERE!\n\nThe over-reliance of flicking on and off, and busting all those street lights and carnival displays had to be about the cheapest stunts I've ever seen in building a menacing character. Apparently, Satan has a childish side. For those of you with children, how many times have you had to scold them for playing with the light switch in your home? Had he any crayons in \"Ghost Rider\", might Satan have defaced Roxanne's (Mendez)bedroom walls, as well?\n\n***SPOILER*** There was one, and only one, shining moment in this entire movie. That was where Roxanne attempted to touch G.R.'s \"face\" affectionately. He turned away, saying (echoing, whatever...)\"monster\". In response, Roxanne said, \"I'm not afraid.\" Then, it seemed that her love for this \"monster\" flowed from her hand and extinguished the flame's of even Hell's wrath from the face of Johnny Blaze. I almost said, \"aw...\", out loud, at that one.\n\nNow I'm exhausted. In writing this, I'm only reliving the agony endured while staring in disbelief at this dud, yet another tumbleweed in the movie-going experience which sadly could have been a fiery rose. I can only hope this review might have saved YOU some agony and distress."

        "review_detailed_main": "So many reasons the movie was bad, but lets just go through some of my top ten. In no real order:\n\n10. Eva Mendes shows us cleavage throughout the movie, except for the last scene. I enjoyed this aspect and had a good laugh about it throughout the film but why have her buttoned up at the end and only at the end, how about some consistency.\n\n9. Fight scenes were god awful. I was hoping the last fight would be something worth sticking around for, but it was only marginally better then the rest. Why was it so bad, cause there was no exchange of punches in battle, each battle lasted only a minute. GR was never in any danger, hell a street thug did more damage than any of the demons. The sun was probably his worst enemy.\n\n8. The demons hiding in different elements, what was with them. They sucked, sure they looked cool, but they couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag. The first scene with them has them all lined up and posing. Hey guys, you have the whole bar, why not spread out, this isn't an ad for jeans. They couldn't fight, and each fight scene only made the movie longer than it should have been.\n\n7. The first time GR transforms it was done really well. I enjoyed it, but after that he turned into GR in a second, no skin melting or anything.\n\n6. The dialog, dear lord why couldn't it have been a silent movie. My favorite line had to be \"A man who believes in love, is a man who can change the world\". Then gave Johnny Blaze the contract for the 1000 souls and possibly the end of the world. I laughed so hard I was crying.\n\n5. Was that the bonanza theme I heard as both the Ghost Riders rode off.\n\n4. Why did Sam Elliot just disappear. He rode with Johnny Blaze to the town, but that was it. He \"had enough for one more transformation\", so why didn't he stay as the GH till after the battle, just come out later. My point is why did he just ride with Cages character and use his last transformation for absolutely NO REASON.\n\n3. Can Cage please stop doing accents.\n\n2. The love story was so bad, so very bad.\n\n1. The director has a good visual feel, but no substance. There is so much to this story, I don't know how he managed to mess up so badly. This movie was way to long, at least it felt way to long.\n\nThis movie is made for 10 year olds, and people who know nothing about Ghost Rider. The start of the movie looked really interesting, and they should have stuck to that. Set it in the old west or something. The special effects were decent, the ghosts at the end were done really well, as well as the first transformation. How Blackheart kills his victims was pretty cool. They may have been trying to make a campy movie. If you like campy, and corny (and yes crappy) then this movie may be for you otherwise, beware. This is not only the worst movie I have seen this year, it's the worst movie I have seen in many year."

Not a keeper and definitely not one of the best comic movies at the moment, but it really was fun."

Ghost Rider was unique in this sense that I didn't only walk out, but asked my company if they were just as through with the load of c**** we had been fed up till then. Little to my surprise they were just as ready as I to get up and out.\n\nI'm still traumatized and was happy to hear that even my sister, who definitely has a more base taste in films also was totally disgusted with it and told me off for not warning her against this horror.\n\nAs for the film itself; for those who might not have guessed. That consisted of characters that were barely two-dimensional in a story so predictable that even without knowing the comic you could tell everything coming about half an hour ahead. If only IMDb would allow for negative stars."

So he made a deal with the Devil (Peter Fonda) to save his father's live and fulfill his dream of becoming a stuntman, now Johnny's all grown up and has become the world's most popular daredevil. With fame and fortune by his side, he soon transforms into a flaming skulled-faced demon avenger with special powers named Ghost Rider and is equipped with a supernatural motorcycle. He's reunited with the former love of his life (Eva Mendes), meets a former Ghost Rider (Sam Elliot) and now the evil BlackHeart (Wes Bently) who wants to bring hell literally on Earth for only Ghost Rider must stop him in order to retain his soul back.\n\nExciting supernatural horror action fantasy thriller from Mark Steve Johnson (Who brought you \"Daredevil\") is based on a popular Marvel Comics character. Stan Lee does a cameo as usual in Marvel movies as this movie is no exception since he produced it too, the performances aren't too bad but the visuals and creature effects are cool including the stunts. Nicolas Cage wasn't too bad playing the main hero and Eva Mendes was certainly a cutie in this movie, i personally think the unrated cut of this movie certainly helps improve the movie better.\n\nIt's not bad but it's fun and certainly not up to the standards of \"Iron Man\", \"Spider-Man 1 & 2\", \"Blade 1 & 2\" or \"X-Men 1 & 2\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "First off, here's the tone of my message: \"I didn't like it due to it not sticking with the comic books.\" My argument here is to all of the Ghost Rider comic book fans and not to anyone who doesn't know anything about Ghost Rider. If you pick up a Ghost Rider comic book, what did you typically see in it? Ghost Rider inflicting vengeance and hardly any \"good or funny tone\" in the comics. GR and his friends were always in a very serious mood in the comics and hardly did you ever see a smile or happiness in it. You might see a smirk every once in a while whenever they would catch the bad guy or some good came out of something that horrible went wrong. I really was looking forward to and compared this movie to the comics because that's what made the Ghost Rider. Yes it's true that in order to make money and to appeal to all audiences that you need to lighten up the mood. However, let's take a look at a successful movie that didn't change the tone such as Batman Begins. Ghost Rider should have been made into a R rated movie just like Blade! GR was known to inflict horrible pain on his enemies and that's why people feared him. That's why cops were trying to capture him, it wasn't because he just looked evil. Even the so called good cop who turned into Vengeance later realized that was why GR was feared by ALL OF HIS ENEMIES. If Ghost Rider couldn't do the Penance Stare on you then he would break your bones and beat the crap out of you until you would know what emotional/physical pain was. I remember an issue where GR had to face Snowblind and since he couldn't do the Penance Stare on him. GR just decided to almost break all of his bones in his body. This is the reason bad guys feared GR. He was ruthless when it came to his so called Justice. He truly got revenge for the innocent blood that was spilled. Unlike Spidey movies, which should have a \"good or funny tone\" in it. The GR movie should have had a dark tone to it. Take a look at the Crow movie, dark and revengeful movie that was somewhat successful for its time. The GR attitude in the movie was not the same as I received in the comics that really got my attention for making this character stand out from the rest. The only good thing that I can comment about this movie was that of the special effects that made GR seem very real and the actors/actress parts that did their best to make the movie appeal mix to all audiences."

But i guess i was pleasantly surprised when i saw the movie was fast paced and had light hearted humor thrown in for good measure of laughs from the audience. Nicolas Cage is one of those few actors who can act really goofy when he wants to and in this movie he has a dead pan expression throughout as if to suggest he no control of what the hell is going on in his life. The best scene in the film is when he confesses to Eva Mendez about his ghost rider \"problem\".\n\nGo and have some old fashioned fun at the movies. 7/10. I would call it a well made entertainer."

I may be dating myself a little here but the not so subtle homage to Easy Rider was definitely there and appreciated...not only was the devil played by Captain America himself, Peter Fonda, but Johnny Blaze's regular chopper is a blend of the most notable motorcycles in bike history, the Captain America and Billy bikes from Easy Rider. The characters and the special effects are good enough to keep you watching, the acting is all as good as you would expect for this type of movie. Love Sam Elliot...this guy always plays a cool western type character...I think he must be this way in real life as well."

The dialogue leaves a lot to be desired, and this movie definitely slows down at one point.\n\nHaving said that, it is still a lot of fun. Early on, we meet the main character and his love interest, which is one of the things that plays our predictably for the most part. We find out about his young life and an important life changing decision he makes. We come to the present day Johnny Blaze and witness his evolution into Ghost Rider. He's given a very specific task he has to undertake, which he does begrudgingly. Watching him handle the early transitions from human to Ghost Rider, I kept thinking of a flaming Hulk. Dr. Banner would have been proud.\n\nJohnny continues his mission, and finds out the answers to some mysteries along the way. Now wanted by the police, he must figure out how to handle what his life has become.\n\nThe effects in this movie are pretty great, and I found myself admiring touches like the flaming trails left by the motorcycle. There were a few humorous moments, and of course a lot of Nick Cage... well... being Nick Cage.\n\nIf you don't mind very imperfect films, this one is a fun way to spend an afternoon.

Well let me tell you that \"Ghost Rider\" is just as bad as everyone makes it out to be.\n\nThe main story had me confused at first and it was hard to figure out who all these characters were. At first I seriously thought that the Blackheart character was a young Johnny Blaze and the scenes involving him were flashbacks of what happened when Johnny had just sold his soul to the devil. Yeah, call me stupid but it wasn't until when Blackheart and Johnny Blaze were for the first time in a sequence together that I realized they were completely different characters. But also when things were 'clear' to me the story remained bad. The story is totally not engaging and it lacked some fundamental things such as a strong good and interesting superhero villain and other characters. Some of the characters that get introduced in the movie suddenly disappear out of the movie, despite showing some potential. Nevertheless \"Ghost Rider\" manages to still put in all of the other clich\u00e9s you could expect from a 'superhero' movie, based on a comic book character. It's really a shallow movie to watch, that offers nothing new to the genre and on top of that is made with less quality and style than other recent and more successful attempts.\n\nThe special effects weren't much good. Well, perhaps the special effects are not that bad but they just got overused so much in so many different sequences, often leaving nothing more but a pointless impression, plus the fact that the CGI look for the Ghost Rider was just rather fake looking at times. It at least didn't met up with the usual 2007 standards.\n\nIt's not that I'm a Nicolas Cage hater but he just wasn't good for the role. Also the entire love story between him and the Eva Mendes character is hardly convincing and really doesn't work out also due to the lack of chemistry. The movie further more also features movie veterans Peter Fonda and Sam Elliott. Most of the other actors don't really know to impress in the movie though.\n\nDespite that the movie featured lots of pace and action, the movie still feels like a real lackluster. It lacks one big good fight and instead features little action bits all the time, which are only leaving you hungry for more instead.\n\nWith a different director and certainly a better script, the Ghost Rider character and franchise still show potential. Let's hope that those involved shall realize this as well and \"Ghost Rider 2\", which is currently in its early production stages, will be a more interesting and better movie to watch, or at least more entertaining.\n\n4/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

A weak villain. Wes Bentley was not bad but he was more like a villain's henchman rather than the villain himself.\n\n2. Nicolas Cage's acting did not fit the movie. He played it straight. He was acting a poor tormented man, taking his drama way too seriously. Why would the director go with that approach?

The story...I can't remember any of it. The script as a whole was a bit of a mess. Something about the deal with the devil and the flaming scull. That is all.\n\nBut the movie also has a few positives:\n\n1. The Ghost Rider. The action parts with the Ghost Rider were a lot of fun. He looks great. I never got tired of that flaming skeleton on a bike. Yes, of course it's just CGI, but it still looked awesome. There was a scene where he rides on the side of a building. It was ridiculous and exactly as God intended.\n\n2. The sound design. The roaring engine of the bike, the dark music, the metal chain smacking around. There is an excellent cling-clang sound pallet to complement the art.\n\nAll in all, I do not know what people expected this would be. It's a B action movie with little to no story in it. Just go with it and have fun."

I remember reading the comic a couple of times as a kid and from the previews it didn't look too bad.

Well, about 50 minutes into it i refused to sit and waste my time on a movie that i would give all the Razzies to unchallenged. Other than the special effects the story is complicated for someone not familiar with the comic book, the dialogue is awful right from the beginning and the cheesiness is unbearable. The ghost rider saying Yeeeehaaaw??? too much for me.

        "review_detailed_main": "Very unaware of why this marvel film has such a low rating, maybe it's because it requires a bit of patience and concentration rather than recent CGI slugfest current marvel mash heads are used to, with style but no substance. This however does have somewhat of a story with heartfelt empathy combined with character development. The love interest in Roxanne played by (Eva Mendas) gives (Cage) as Johnny Blaze something more to work with. Although Nicolas Cage is one of the stand out performers he has plenty of support, the entire cast are on top form in this. I have often thought in this type of genre it is essential to have a strong villain, for me some of the best cinematic films of this type are enhanced by having that antagonist present. (Wes Bentley) as Blackheart fills the shoes pretty well in my book, he has memorable moments claiming to be alpha whilst telling his father it's time to step aside. Lacking his fathers approval it appears he takes matters into his own hands. Another stand out character for me was the caretaker of the church/graveyard (Sam Elliott) who inadvertently seems to step in as the new fatherly figure of Johnny Blaze. The love story between Blaze and Roxanne gives both hope of what could be alongside all the chaos of Johnny being the devils servant. Cage and Mendas share a nice chemistry, they are likeable, which in turn makes me invested to root for them. The special effect are fantastic however they aren't overused, they freshly blend in with some great camera angles, shots and sets. What's interesting is how Johnny Blaze has very little control as well as awareness as to what is happening to him. Even though he made the deal with the devil we can see he never really expects anything to come of this. The transformation of Cage into ghost rider isn't just great special effects it's a testament to Cages acting, along with his disbelief we experience his challenges of honing the curse as a new skill. (Donal Logue) who plays his friend Mack and tour guy on the crazy stunts helps further explore the theme of Johnny finding out who he is. Overall this is a worthy comic book entry in film and somewhat underrated."

The young man knows one day the devil will ask for a favor in return and because he knows this is coming he refuses to fall in love, settle down and have a family. When the Devil's son decides it's his time to rule planet Earth the devil decides to cash in his IOU and asks the young man to stop his son. Meanwhile, love is on the young man's door step but he's scared to commit. Can he do both, save the world and be in love?\n\nThis movie is directed by Mark Steven Johnson (Love, Guaranteed) and stars Nicolas Cage (The Rock), Peter Fonda (Easy Rider), Eva Mendes (Hitch), Sam Elliott (Road House), Donal Logue (Blade) and Wes Bentley (American Beauty).\n\nThis cast is absolutely amazing, top to bottom. Sam Elliot was tremendous in this picture, both as a character and as a narrator. The CGI is a bit inconsistent with every scene with the Ghost Rider being outstanding and every scene with Dark Heart being awful. The writing, specifically the dialogue, was cheesy and inconsistent, but the overall premise and circumstances were fun and entertaining.\n\nOverall, this is a very uneven movie with some worthwhile elements and some painful sequences. I would score this a 6.5/10 and recommend seeing it once."

I just think Cage's unique appearance is perfect for the Rider (and that's a compliment, Mr Cage!). He does the character justice.\n\nThere's been Riders before. Riders who ride for the Devil, collecting souls and contracts. However, one Rider went against the Devil many years ago, and now another one is about to do the same. His name is Johnny Blaze, a daredevil motorcyclist who was tricked by the Devil into becoming a Rider. Nicolas Cage stars as Johnny Blaze, and he does a mighty fine job, me thinks!\n\nEva Mendes stars as his love interest, Roxanne. She allows for most of the humor elements and I just love her in the movie. Ah, and then there's the legend: Sam Elliott. That voice! That moustache! Elliott stars as a character simply referred to as Caretaker - a somewhat mysterious man whose identity is revealed as a twist, so keep an eye on this character! Although the Devil - or Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) appear to be the villain, the main antagonist is his son, Blackheart (Wes Bentley) - a ruthless and determined 'angel'.\n\nI enjoyed the many different elements of the movie. There's drama, humor, horror, action, adventure, and in the midst of everything it is also a sweet love story - and a classic good versus evil story, as well. All these genres blend perfectly to bring us an action-packed, visual spectacle superhero movie. The action sequences are fast paced and the stunts truly amazing. Love it, love it, love it!\n\n'Ghost Rider' was followed by a sequel 'Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance' but rather give that a skip, as it was really awful!\n\nWould I watch it again? Yes."

        "review_detailed_main": "The trailers have finished and the lights are dimming completely now. That familiar torch lady in the Columbia Pictures logo has appeared and quickly vanishes into the Marvel Comics flipping logo which transforms into a Ghost Rider inspired font. Finally the Crystal Sky logo is shown, then it comes; a somewhat interesting, but not quite exciting narration by Sam Elliott, who here plays the Caretaker. After we are told the \"backstory\" the high energy, fire decorated opening credits begin. It's here I think to myself, come on Johnson, impress me. About an hour and fifty minutes later I accept the fact that I asked for too much. Don't get me wrong, there's lot of sparks, most being the visuals, but the fire never really gets going in 'Ghost Rider'.\n\nThe storyline here really isn't all that complex. When Johnny Blaze, first played Matthew Long, was a teen he made a deal with the Devil, better known here as Mephistopheles, played by Peter Fonda. This deal was to save his \"father\" from the cancer that was slowly killing him. Mephisto keeps to the deal, but Johnny's \"father\" dies later that same day during a motorcycle stunt. In exchange for his \"father's\" health, even though short-lived, Johnny will one day be called upon to become the Ghost Rider and do Mephisto's bidding. Years later, Johnny, now played by Nicolas Cage, is a famous stunt driver and is haunted by the deal he made every day of his life. The time comes and he is revisited by Mephiso and told to seek out and destroy Blackheart, played by Wes Bently, who has his own team of thugs known as the Nephilim. Once he does, Johnny is promised his soul will be returned, thus ridding him of the curse he currently bears.\n\nSo there you have it, the basic outline for 'Ghost Rider'. That is where the film first starts to fall apart. The real story of Johnny Blaze's life and how he becomes Ghost Rider is slightly different. Crash is not Johnny's actual father as we are led to believe. (That's why I put quotations around father in the above description.) His wife Mona isn't even in the film and Mephisto is never driven away by Roxanne's purity either here. These among other things are some of the ways Mark Steven Johnson's take on 'Ghost Rider' isn't true to the comic. I myself aren't a Ghost Rider fanatic or anything close, but I'm sure those that are will find these alterations unnecessary and questionable. For the rest of the public that are unaware though, they'll just take it as is as they're force fed Johnson's $120 million adaptation.\n\nOh, but that's not all that's bad folks. Acting skill was apparently not a priority. If it were, I believe someone else would have been cast in the role of Roxanne, played by Eva Mendes. I'm. Not. Going. Anywhere. Digging deep, that's how Mendes' lines come out. It. Was. Almost. Robotic. The. Way. She. Spoke. Bently is not very good either. He's just doesn't come off villainous enough. He's got the look I guess, but that's about it. It's not entirely the actor's fault's though. The combined effort of Johnson, Shane Salerno, David S. Goyer, & Jonathan Hensleigh that's called a screenplay is far from good writing. A couple weeks back and again this week I was warned that the comics weren't written too well either. Let me just say to that person now, Nick, if they're anything like the dialogue in the film, you were dead on. Too much comedy was added in as well. Continuously jokes are spread throughout, which takes away from the sense of seriousness and drama that I believe was crucial for everything to work.\n\nThe visuals are what in the end strive to be the focal point of the film. The fire doesn't always appear to be real, but everything is just plain cool looking. The most memorable moment for me was when the water element member of the Nemphilim's eye drips down his face and he wipes it off while instantaneously another eye appears. That was pretty awesome. I can't forget about the bike though, it's beautiful. As a whole though, the pricey CGI isn't enough to compensate for all the mistakes. 'Ghost Rider' makes it clear that Johnson should leave comic characters alone. He obviously can't do it right, so why even attempt?"

They should keep you on the edge of your seat. Unfortunately, Ghost Rider is incredibly slow. It actually made me angry to see any semblance of good, tight writing ignored and replaced with stunts and special effects.\n\nUgh. Don't waste your time with this one. I hope Marvel and DC don't give this guy access to any other titles in the catalog."

I enjoyed this film, not because the acting was brilliant or the story line grabbed me, but because it was fun, the special effects were excellent, and it is a good action/fantasy movie to cheer you up. I found myself grinning and laughing at some of the 'camp' moments and music choices. The script sounds like a comic which works well with the comic- like atmosphere this film creates. I don't know how true to the original Marvel it is, however as a stand alone movie it is great fun and easy to watch- no puzzling out difficult story lines- or thinking at all actually.\n\nSilly and enjoyable for a rainy day."

To hear a story, if not a good one--at least one well told. To have fun.\n\nThere are films that are bad, but still a good time because of the feeling you have when you leave the theater. Then there are bad films which are so incompetent that they make you more cautious about how you really want to spend your time.\n\nThis film was bad in every way that matters, unless special effects are your reason for living.\n\nThe dialog is so jarringly terrible, a viewer almost expects every line to end with a smile--to be part of some joke before they get on with their real lines. The actors seem bored and uninspired in their roles, and Nicholas Cage seems wooden even for... Well, even for Nicholas Cage.\n\nIf it weren't for movies like National Treasure, I would have sworn to never see another Cage film again. I do not know how any actor's agent let them have a part in this movie without a letter of resignation, but this happens sometimes. Look up \"Gigli\" and \"88 Minutes\" for other examples.\n\nPlease do not pay money for this movie. Viewing it is like pushing rusty carpenter nails into your abdomen. It is so bad that it is a running joke among everyone I know. When a bad movie is released, we say, \"Well, it isn't Ghost rider, but it was still crap.\" Avoid this movie. For the children."

The rest of the stunts are equally ordinary not a single one is worth a mention, to add to that the CLIMAX IS AS ORDINARY AS IT GETS.\n\nSave for the presence of Nicholas Cage this movie would have made a great B-movie.\n\nShockingly the acting to is completely ordinary Nicholas plays a spaced out character that would have been better suited in movies like mall-rats, clerks etc. Not a single character rises above B movie standards.\n\nBy far the best this about this movie is Eva Mendes she looks sizzling, she brings much needed humour to the film and even though i hate to say it there love angle is by far the best part about this film, and did i mention THAT SHES MORE SIZZLING THAN THE ON FIRE GHOST RIDER.\n\nThe soundtrack is disappointing too, and character development is minimum, the entire movie feels like an exercise to make the mandatory 3 sequels (atleast) that we have come to associate with Hollywood in recent times,THANK GOD THIS MOVIE HAS NO POTENTIAL FOR THE EVEN MORE TORTOROUS SPIN-OFFS (think Electra and cat-woman).\n\nWhat could have made a great B-movie is not only a bad/ordinary A-movie.\n\nThe film-makers could have got the hint when the best power that GR gives the people a taste of their own sins,hardly exciting when by Christian standards MORE THAN HALF THE WORLD AND THE WHOLE OF America HAS A PLACE RESERVED IN HELL.\n\nEven though I've hardly written anything good about the movie pulls through on some good one liners, EVA MENDES, LOADS OF ORDINARY SCENES THAT JUST ABOUT HOLD YOUR ATTENTION AND Phenomenally LOW Expectations.\n\nWatch only if really really bored, if you like B-Movies and are willing to see this as one, and love Eva Mendes (shes wearing clothes fit for a nun though), free tickets for the premiere(in my case) or really cheap matin\u00e9e show is a must.\n\n-s weak on all technical fronts including acting (suprisingly), no excitement whatsoever.\n\n+/-s would have made a good/great B-movie.\n\n+s EVA MENDES, good one liners and humour, lots of ordinary scenes that hold your attention.\n\ntotal 5/10 (facoring in expectations (lets not talk about PG-13) if you watch it like an A-list movie with Nicholas Cage then the rating will be much lower)"

The Marvel-based, skull-burning character finds his script adaptation feeling methodically predictable even to non-fans, despite the special Gothic and Texan flavor that tries, unsuccessfully, to pull the movie further away from it's generic trappings.\n\nPlaying out a little too unintentionally comical at times, Ghost Rider's action sequences nonetheless provide the only distraction from the not-so-great acting, of course fronted by Nicolas Cage's overdone, ego-driven theatrics. While a few of these blazingly violent and vibrant physical scenes seemingly indulge the opposite in essence of our freakishly looking, damned soul of an antihero to a silly degree, on the whole this movie is saved from an irredeemable pit of tedium by the always reliable and ever increasing detailed effects design, which stands out from many standard comic book approaches, often implemented with thoughtful, sharp focus.\n\nThe visceral heart of these effect sequences may not be enough to justify a viewing from anyone who is not already a fan of this stuff, but it will be enough to pump up a general audience with it's hell-on-wheels aesthetics. Ignore the climax's dull relaying of a theme and enjoy this for what it is, a mildly fun little airheaded motorcycle ride through the desert with some inventive eye candy."

One might compare it to the original Alien movie versus the Aliens movie(#2), in that the second version got right into the action and never let up. Ghost rider two could be a top notch action flick.

        "review_detailed_main": "A friend of mine showed this to me on DVD at school a few days ago and at first, I wasn't very interested, but since this is one of the few superhero movies I've recently seen, I thought, \"Oh, well. Might as well give this a shot.\" and watched it with little expectations. A few minutes later, when I see the Ghost Rider started appearing for the first time, I was left speechless, but in terms of story in narrative forms, I don't think that this is a masterpiece of superhero films, although I do think that this is a very good movie.\n\nI understand all the criticism it had when it first came out in theaters and I'll admit that the dialog is pretty silly along with it's inept script containing it's schmaltzy moments, but in my opinion, I liked this for what it was.\n\nI like the music from Christopher Young. His blend of Gothic and western themes along with some guitar pieces fitted well for the film. The CGI effects, although below par, are at least decent with some neatly detailed look of the Ghost Rider and his awesome bike. The action is also pretty cool too with Ghost Rider killing his enemies, but I think the acting steals the show. Sam Elliot did great with his role, Eva Mendes did very well as the lead role's love interest and Peter Fonda did a decent job as Mephisto. Now, I don't hate Nicolas Cage as much, but I personally think that he was miscasted as the leading role. I think a much better actor (like Jake Gyllenhaal, perhaps?) would have fitted the role. Wes Bentley, however, is uninteresting as the villain due to his lack of emotion.\n\nOK, I know you guys are going to hate me for this, but... I really like the story. Now, I never read the comics this was based on, but I think that it's really faithful to the spirit and tone despite it's disappointing ending (which was the only problem that I do have with the plot) and has some nice visuals; not to mention it has great cinematography. The editing however, is rather choppy at times.\n\nSo, is Ghost Rider's a masterpiece? Not exactly. Is it as bad as the critics and others say it is. Not quite. Like I said, I understand the criticism it had in a superhero movie, but that kind of hatred goes to Batman & Robin and Steel (those were terrible superhero movies). So, overall, not great, but I liked it for what it was and it's a faithful adaptation of the comics I never read."

These tastes have gone downhill in recent years and this concerns me. We may have to have a movie intervention for him, but that's another story.\n\nI suppose if you're into movies where the dialog consists of \"I'm gonna kick your butt\" / \"I don't think so\" for about two hours, you won't be disappointed in \"Ghost Rider.\" The script, which sounds like a fanfic written by a seventh grader, is simplistic enough to hold the attentions of even the most ADD-riddled viewer. So much so, that it seems implausible that Cage's Johnny Blaze (a well thought out name if ever there was one) would have the knowledge necessary to understand the theology books that are central to the plot. Maybe he just saw the bitchin' pictures and pieced it together in his head.\n\nWhile the script is the movie's biggest problem, there are several others that make a bad situation even worse. Such as the terribly long pacing, the XBox-worthy CGI effects and the wooden performances of all actors involved. Particularly those of the comely love interest Roxanne Simpson, a roving reporter who seemingly got through Journalism School by her cleavage alone. Sam Elliot makes a cameo in an attempt to bring a bit of dignity to the film, but all he does is spout some faux-religious bunk about the Ghost Rider being the Devil's gofer. You'd think by now, somebody would have just challenged him to a fiddle contest by now. It would have been more interesting to watch.\n\nAlso of note is the movie's anti-smoking message, which is more heavy-handed than anything truth.com could have come up with. Young Johnny's father smokes Marlboros and is dead five minutes later. However, in a later scene, many of Blaze's friends are seen playing poker and smoking Lucky Strikes. The moral of the story: smoking Marlboros will kill you. So will this movie. Especially if you payed to see it. Wait for it to come out on DVD and play \"Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Home Game\" with it."

Whether this can translate effectively into a movie is still open to debate but for my part, I reckon that the cast and crew have made a fine attempt at carrying it off.\n\nIt's a bit slow to start, can be irritating if taken too seriously but is ultimately, viewed with the right attitude, a good fun action movie with some nice effects.\n\nOh, and did I mention that Eva Mendes is BEYOND fine in this movie...? Never really been a fan before but HOT DAMN!!\n\nIf for nothing else, it's worth a look just for her......"

It seems like the writer and director had someone else in mind. Someone who is revered for his physical and over-the-top acting. A particular B- movie icon that can be convincing as a hapless-schmuck-turned-hero.\n\nSimply put, Nick Cage could have been yanked out of the picture and Bruce \"The Chin\" Campbell easily (and more convincingly) could've been inserted.\n\nCage is an Oscar-worthy actor. You don't need a \"Leaving Las Vegas\" caliber lead playing a guy who becomes a walking inferno on a chopper from hell. You need Bruce. Hell, Bruce is to me what Affleck is to Kevin Smith. He can play anything, yes even the shark in Jaws.\n\nGhost Rider was a fun ride, but when you see it, imagine the guy from EVIL DEAD as Johnny Blaze. You'll see it too."

And I mean LINEAR, have anyone of u guys played a 2 dimensional video game... yea the plots like that (a series of lesser bosses that must be dispensed with before the main boss...).\n\nAND these lesser-boss battles with the devil's son's minions are VERy Disappointing, because approximately 4 fights have to be crammed in they all last like 2 seconds. Mainly he fights like terminator, but worse, he is super slow/strong and just hits things and thats it without even a resounding impact... (or stares at em, u'll see, or not).\n\nOVerall, this is a rental, at best. THE FILM IS EXACTLY LIKE SPAWN, or so I thought, from what I could remember. but i think spawn is cooler(-ish)"

        "review_detailed_main": "The string of superhero movies goes on and this time, it's Marvel Comics' Ghost Rider's turn to heat up the big screen.\n\nDuring the day, he's Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) - a stunt motorcyclist who once sold his soul to Mephisto (Peter Fonda) in exchange for a cure to his father's cancer. However, the contract involves Johnny transforming to a blazing skeleton by night in the presence of evil, bound to work for Mephisto in defeating Blackheart (Wes Bentley), the ambitious son of Mephisto who wants to make a hell out of the world - literally.\n\nWritten and directed by Mark Steven Johnson, the film has an introductory note for Johnny Blaze which clearly feels a lot like the filmmaker's previous Marvel project \"Daredevil.\" The way it's presented does seem formulaic but it manages to decently portray the main character to the viewer. Cage also doesn't seem to be a good idea to play the role but as the film progressed, the more he managed to prove me wrong by doing a good job of combining a sense of grit and humor for his character.\n\nThe characterizations of the supporting characters, however, were rather insipid. Eva Mendes as Roxie Simpson, Johnny's love interest, serves more like a perfunctory female touch to the film as her character has been devoted with so little concern. I'm tempted to say that the villains are too one-dimensional but they're demons, which may be the point.\n\nThe movie overall is a decent way to spend a Valentine evening, although at times, the plot becomes a little confused. The fight scenes lack a sense of urgency, and the love angle feels too casual. But Cage gives a good performance and there are enough humorous moments to make for a somewhat fun if bumpy ride."

The Ghost Rider effects were cool, the fights totally lame, the story was also lame while at the same time being inconsistent with the comics and the dialogue was generally dreadful. On the plus side, Eva Mendes must have the most gorgeous rack in modern cinema, this alone should keep the young male fans entertained.\n\nWhere was the love story? Where was the witty, cowboyesque banter? Where was the Blaze/GR duality? The struggle between GR and Satan for his soul? Sorry all cut to make the story 'better' *cough* *cough* *hurl* In the end I give this movie 5 stars, 4 stars for finally seeing GR on the big screen, 3 stars for Eva Mendes' boobies and -2 stars for choosing Nicholas Cage as Johnny Blaze/Ghostrider. And if we total all this up that's correct if I wasn't a huge GR fan this would be a 1! They must have hired the guys that made The Phantom to ruin this one."

I mean, it looked like she was fixing to explode out of her shirts. But, I guess that was to appeal to the teenage boy audience.\n\nI liked Sam Elliots's role too. His deep voice just sounds so perfect for the movies.\n\nBlackheart looked like a wimpy goth. And the bad guys are defeated very easily by the Ghost Rider. But the Ghost Rider's pentance stare was awesome.\n\nOne glaring plot hole: How did the police connect a bunch of frozen bodies to a motorcycle stunt driver and arrest him for their murders?\n\nFINAL VERDICT: Much better than expected.

Granted, it has the ultimate cheesy dialog that I've heard, but it is based off a comic, so I actually let that go. Nicolas Cage, while I still question the casting of him as Ghost Rider, don't get me wrong, he does look good, but he's a little old for the action hero gig, but he does make the film work pretty well. I understand a lot of people not liking this movie, besides the dialog, the effects are a bit much, but I feel like this was an honest comic book film and had all the action and excitement it should have.\n\nJohnny Blaze made a very bad deal, a deal with the devil when he learns about his father having cancer, the devil will cure Johnny's dad, if Johnny agrees to be his bounty hunter, the Ghost Rider. Johnny's soul is now in the hands of the devil, meaning that nothing can come between them: family, friends, or love. But when Johnny's old love returns to his life, he takes this as a sign, and wants to tell her about his curse. But the devil's son, Blackheart, who wants to bring Hell on Earth, must be stopped and Ghost Rider is on the mission.\n\nGhost Rider really, honestly is not that bad of a movie. I would say that it is average, but it delivered what it promised. I do hate CGI effects, especially the cheesy ones, but the effects were pretty cool in Ghost Rider. I thought the effect of Ghost Rider riding up the side of the sky scraper was so cool to look at. Ghost Rider is definite eye candy, it has good actors, and a cool story; I'm not going to lie, it's flawed, but I feel like people were a little too harsh and just didn't want to give the film a fair chance. I watched it expecting trash and I found myself enjoying Ghost Rider, so just grab the popcorn and watch it with an open mind.\n\n6/10"

The acting by Wes Bentley was horrid and I believe it's 50/50 director and actor's fault.Bentley obvious wasn't concerned about his performance or watched his dailies to adjust his \"method\" or \"approach\". Even worse is the awful grating of Ghost Rider's \"voice\". Sounds like Ghost Rider has a carton a day habit. Then there's Eva Mendes trying to make the best out of a bad project along with Cage. But this movie is just inexcusable for looking like a 20 million dollar flick with a supposed 80+ million budget. I think Johnson spent it all on Cage's hairpiece."

        "review_detailed_main": "The problem with comicbook films is that once the filmmakers decide to distance themselves from the source material, a necessary step that all films face upon adaptation, the core audience immediately goes on the defense. Pleasing said fans is always a difficult task. GHOST RIDER, then, succeeds on the level that it is a fun, comicbook adapted film. However, placed against some its more successful contemporaries, the campy nature of GHOST RIDER is its chief detractor.\n\nThe Marvel Comics anti-hero Ghost Rider got his start in Marvel Spotlight #5 in 1972 and the film's origin resembles the comicbook tale close enough: motorcyclist Johnny Blaze makes a deal with the devil transforming him, at times, to be an fiery instrument of vengeance. Marvel then revamped and updated the character in 1990 completing the skull-like visage with a flaming chain and spikes. Writer/director Mark Steven Johnson takes elements from the classic story and incorporates it with the stylizations of the more modern version in an attempt to please both worlds.\n\nOpening with an origin that unfortunately lasts the entire first \u0096 and lengthy \u0096 act, the film finally roars into action as the damned Blaze (Nic Cage) fights against the devil's son, Blackheart (AMERICAN BEAUTY's Wes Bentley) and his demonic horde. Bentley pulls off the rogue with a smile but at times he and his cronies' post-MATRIX get-up have all the posturing of an upstart emo band. Even Cage and Sam Elliott, playing his mentor, camp it up at times playing mere parodies of themselves. Topping off the cast is the ultimate Easy Rider, Peter Fonda, playing a laughably-scary devil with a grin-and-a-wink that seems to channel Jack Nicholson.\n\nOnce the action begins, the film pits the flaming Ghost Rider up against elemental demons and, predictably, the police. And like all clich\u00e9 Westerns or their rock-n-roll, comicbook counterparts, there seems to be nothing his American Chopper-possessed bike cannot do, which even comes to his side when whistled like a loyal steed.\n\nWhat the film desperately lacks is any sense of a real and natural environment. Story aside, what made the SPIDER-MAN and X-MEN films successful is the fact that these unreal events were happening the world right outside the window. Here, the humor \u0096 both intended and ridiculous \u0096 prevents that barrier from ever entirely withdrawing. Another impediment is the film's rating. Taking a similar path to the BLADE films and first CROW, Marvel should have pushed for a R rating to truly give the devil his due. More dark horror and less toothy one-liners would have made an electrifying film, something that video game-looking ghosts and goblins cannot properly achieve.\n\nAt best, Ghost Rider is a b-grade superhero; his film falls into the same classification. But true fans should already be aware of this. After all, boyhood fantasies of a flaming skull warrior on a tricked out bike can only go so far. This film meets you half the way."

There isn't enough story her to carry the film and make it interesting.\n\nThe only thing that was interesting was Eva Mendes (Hitch, Training Day).

Well, it wasn't ridiculous, but it wasn't that great either.\n\nBasically, this is about a motorcycle stuntman who inadvertently sells his soul to the devil to help his ailing father. When he learns he got a bad deal, it's too late ... but he is then given a mission which could free him.\n\nThe movie was much better than it looked in the trailers. However, the result was still not that great. Part of it may be that the idea of a supernatural motorcycle superhero may have been appealing in the 70s, but it doesn't seem very potent today. Other than that, the story is only mildly engaging. It could have been worst, so this is not such a bad result.\n\nThis movie is not really worth seeing unless you're a fan of this comic book character."

The problem is that when you are not directors, is behind a monitor, you can write what you want, reaching even to write untruths. On the Internet everything happens often, most of the films are rejected, not because the films are produced evil but because there are few characters particularly receptive. It must be very insensitive and apathetic to define this film minimalist and reductive, if you do not like the film then you become directors as there attenete word by word to the book. Cmq repeat reports love and hatred in the film are well represented and I believe this film excellent saving the usual hot air of criticism misplaced. Vedetelo!

        "review_detailed_main": "Fantastic Four. X-Men. Spider-Man. Superman. Daredevil. Batman. Hellboy. The Hulk.\n\nThe past few years Hollywood has dipped their money grabbing hands into the comic book hero cookie jar and have pulled out pure chocolate chip glory. From the more popular and well known characters such as Spider-Man to the obscure independent titles like Constantine and Spawn, it seems like every month a new title is being released to the masses. And due to the built-in audience these characters bring with them like traveling luggage, it almost guarantees the studio a strong opening week-end no matter how good or inferior the product.\n\nThis month's release is Marvel Comic's Ghost Rider which stars Academy Award winner Nicolas Cage as the Johnny Blaze by day \u0096 Ghost Rider by night crime fighter.\n\nGhost Rider might be a little more obscure for the casual comic book character fan so let me get you caught up to speed on the skeletal hot-head.\n\nJohnny Blaze was a young hot shot motorcycle stunt man with his father when he makes a deal to sell his soul to the devil, Mephistopheles (played in the film by Peter Fonda) in an effort to save his fathers life. Johnny later finds that the deal has more side effects than prescription medicine for hair loss. For \"in the darkness, in the presence of evil, the Rider takes over\", transforming Blaze into a skeletal beast with bones and skull afire that rides a hell bent pimped out motorcycle that would give the guys on American Chopper an erection.\n\nThe evil villain in the film is none other than Blackheart (Wes Bentley), son of Mephistopheles, who looks to overpower his father and turn our world into a hell on earth. Think of it as if someone from Hell was a designer on Trading Spaces.\n\nIn an effort to bring his bleak and death sucking vision to us unassuming humans, Blackheart solicits the aide of three interesting but otherwise useless supernatural beings representing the elements of earth, wind and fire (Great! Now I can't get Let's Groove outta me head!).\n\nOf course, complicating matters is Blaze's old flame Roxanne Simpson (Eva Mendes). Simpson is now a local reporter and she and her cleavage (which I might add should have their own listing in the credits as they transfixed my eyes more than any of the characters that graced the films running time) just happen to be executing a bit on Johnny Blaze when things start to go the way of Hades. As this is a comic book movie, there is no doubt that Roxanne will be used against our flaming skull hero in some manner before the story comes to a close and director Mark Steven Johnson who went from Simon Birch to Daredevil and now Ghost Rider, does nothing to deviate from this formulaic plan.\n\nWhen the sum of all its parts are calculated and reviewed, Ghost Rider barely gets by with a recommendation. Maybe if the film was pre-Spider-man and X-Men, the film might have been more interesting and inventive, but with such a paved path already laid, Ghost Rider feels like you are walking barefoot on cobblestone.\n\nOne of the main successes of any superhero fantasy comes in the form of the villains and it is with these characters that Ghost Rider falls short. Don't get me wrong, the villains are all fascinating and some might even argue terrifying, but they are beat so easily by the Ghost Rider that you don't get a chance to even recognize their powers before they are sent back to wherever it is these beings go after being defeated. I don't think they collectively had a page of lined script before each one is individually eliminated.\n\nThat leaves the Blackheart character that is the least interesting and terrifying of the bunch. Wes Bentely looked more like some kind of character from a Dawn of the Dead Saturday Night Live sketch than he did a menacing Lord of the Underworld.\n\nGhost Rider did have its good points though. Some of the special effects were well done (I do mean 'some' as others seemed too cheesy to be enjoyed) and the camp is played out like Snakes on a Plane from last year where the dialogue and situations are so-bad-its-good.\n\nNicolas Cage \u0096 who was such a huge fan of the comic that he got a Ghost Rider tattoo years before even being considered for the role \u0096 looks as if he is having as much fun as a root canal recipient in the lead role. Maybe he should have taken a lesson from Halle Berry who is another Oscar winning actor that looked embarrassed when donning the leather tights for the Superhero film Catwoman.\n\nThis leaves Ghost Rider in the middle of the pack when it comes to overall product from a comic book character film production. It is certainly higher than The Punisher and Elektra, but a far cry from the superior X-Men and Spider-Man franchises.\n\nwww.robertsreviews.com"

For people who watched Daredevil, than you know what I am talking about, famous casts, good CGs, but a very average plot and directing. The fights with the villains are lackluster especially with the minor villains. The acting from Nicolas Cage, Peter Fonda and Eva Mendes all seemed very routine. All Eva Mendes does in the movie is consistently showing off her cleavage, while it's great to look at, the chemistry between her and Nicolas Cage seemed non-existence. Give this movie the same expectation as \"Daredevil\" as they are very the same product, different package."

        "review_detailed_main": "I should've known. No, really. I should've. The same director who helmed that super successful superhero masterpiece known as \"Blind Battfleck\", I mean, 'Daredevil'. Perhaps Johnson learnt from his past mistakes when it comes to dealing with superheroes that mass audiences aren't entirely familiar with. Maybe, just maybe, the irreverent use of the \"Cage Rage\" could spontaneously combust this adaptation into a ghoulish inferno of apocalyptic excellence. Or, just to restore some remnants of faith, produce a film that is mediocre. Alas, not the case.\n\nGhost Rider is terrible. Woeful. Dreadful. Fully exorcising the ineptitude of amateur comic book adaptations that preceded this monstrosity and somehow tainting them even further, granting this hellish anti-hero no chance of retrieving his soul back. Johnny Blaze, the \"Human Torch\" who \"flames on\" whenever he needs to, sells his soul to the devil in order to spare his father's life. A supposed antagonistic demon makes his debut and thus Blaze must become a Ghost Rider in order to stop him from acquiring the contract of \"I-Don't-Give-A-Toss\".\n\nIf there was any ounce of literary creativity within this screenplay, or any other element of the film, I may have paid more attention whilst being perched on the edge of my seat from the sheer velocity that Ghost Rider rides his skeletal metallic motorcycle. Flames etched onto the road. Demonic dubbing that echoed the streets of wherever the heck this film was set. Cage screaming his lungs out as his face melts from the inside. It's fundamentally incoherent. No matter how much lunacy Cage injected into his vicious pointing or how minuscule Mendes' acting capacity may be, if the storytelling is executed with no common sense whatsoever, there's no point. None. And it's abundantly clear in Ghost Rider.\n\nIt starts off with an emotional acceleration, between Blaze and his father, which in turn produces some required apathy. After those introductory moments of tenderness were over, tackling an uninspired origin story, Blaze propels himself off a ramp and never lands. Look, he's still gliding over those CGI helicopters now! There were approximately seven minutes of action. Four antagonists, each harnessing a differing elemental power, are defeated in seconds. Don't ask me their names, I haven't got a clue and the film doesn't deserve to be researched prior to this decimation. No build up. Just a vacant stare and we're moving on. The absence of threat was abundantly clear, and as soon as Mr. Monotonous (that's the villain's name now...) reads a piece of paper and obtains glowing red eyes, the film was over.\n\nSo with no action or real substance, what the heck was happening for two hours you might ask? Just a road trip back and forth between a romantic sub-plot and Sam \"Exposition\" Elliott, spelling out a plot that had more lore than a frickin' 'Lord of the Rings' compendium. I just...don't care. If Cage didn't care, Mendes didn't care and Ghost Rider himself didn't care, why should I? I had to sit through two hours of complacent visual effects, for nothing to actually happen. The cheesy tone that Johnson outlined didn't suit the darker apocalyptic world that Ghost Rider resided in within the comics. I don't want to hear another \"skull\" pun. I don't!\n\nAnd if there's only one thing I'm going to take away from this endurance test, it's consuming jelly beans in a martini glass. However that minor positive, which may or may not change my life forever, did not substantiate me sitting through the entirety of this boring adaptation. Quite simply one of the worst Marvel films in their canon, and I've still got the sequel to watch..."

While it may not have been the blockbuster we saw with Spiderman, that may only lie in the fact that Spiderman was more well known. The special effects are very good.\n\nRealize you are being introduced to a character with this movie. It is not like seeing the first Batman where most people were very familiar with the expected storyline. Ghost Rider starts from the beginning giving the character purpose. You will not need a future movie to build the character's beginnings. Even if the numbers do not exceed expectations I fully expect a sequel from this feature.\n\nSome people may have expected more dramatization or more side stories. I think you will see that in future sequels. Sony and Marvel have installed a foundation and now we see if they build on it.\n\nThe movie is fairly decent for all ages except the extremely young who may have a slight problem reconciling some of the ghostly images. It does touch to the edge of fright without delving into a straight out horror flick, which is not its goal.\n\nGo see it. It is worth the initial viewing and fans will probably buy the DVD."

It's definitely not a masterpiece or even very memorable, but thrills and entertainment are guaranteed throughout the entire playtime. It's a rather gruesome comic book adaptation, dealing with contracts with the devil and doomed souls, but the execution is light-headed and enthusiast. In order to save his father from slowly and painfully dying of cancer, young stunt rider Johnny Blaze gives up his soul to the devilish Mephistopheles. Several years later, Johnny Blaze is a successful daredevil stunt-rider who seemingly can't get injured, yet Mephistopheles approaches him to live up to his part of the contract. He'll become Ghost Rider, the devil's bounty hunter assigned to prevent Blackheart \u0096 a fallen angel - from unleashing a new hell on earth. There are a whole lot of sub plots, for example Johnny's reunion with his former girlfriend and the mysterious cemetery caretaker who suspiciously knows a lot about Johnny's dreadful situation, but the main focus here is Nicolas Cage's flamboyant outfits and fiery skull as he transforms into the Ghost Rider overnight. The battles between him and Blackheart's associates (representing the primary elements) are pretty exciting and the visual effects are competently presented. The action sequences result in a lot of damage and mayhem, which is always entertaining to behold from a comfortable seat in the theater. Cage is a terrific actor, clever enough to not take his role overly serious and therefore adds quite a lot of comical elements to his character, like dry one-liners and eccentric tics. It was particularly pleasant to see Peter Fonda star again in a big-budgeted production, especially considering the role he plays! Just a couple of days ago, I watched the movie \"Race With The Devil\" in which a much younger Fonda desperately attempts to flee from a bunch of pursuing devil-worshipers, yet in this comic book vehicle, he plays the Devil himself and clearly enjoys it. The filming locations and the majority of set-pieces look effectively sinister, Eva Mendes is hot as ever, skull dude's motorcycle and armory is awesome and there even is a modern update of Johnny Cash' great song \"Ghost Riders in the Sky\" on the soundtrack! I can't possibly talk too negative about a film like this. It's great, mindless entertainment."

        "review_detailed_main": "I mean, 'Ghost Rider (2007)' is coherent - in the most liberal sense of the word - but it just keeps making choices that are questionable at best. It sticks so incredibly close to the 'early-2000s superhero' formula that you'd swear it was at least five years older than it is. It also thinks it's so darn cool - though, this is probably par for the course with a film about a motorcycle-riding stunt-guy who has a flaming skull for a head. When you think about it, not much of it really makes sense, beat-for-beat, and the story itself just doesn't go anywhere. Don't even get me started on its use of flashbacks. You can't even 'turn your brain off' because the visuals are probably its worst aspect. The only positive about the cinematography is that it's usually in focus, and the editing is so brash that it makes you feel as if your skull really is on fire. The visual effects are somehow so poorly conceived that they usually look like horror-themed Snapchat filters. The acting is hammy but not entertaining - I mean, Nick Cage's intermittent southern drawl just makes him intermittently unintelligible - and most of the main players just seem like they're in it for the pay-check, often clearly reading their lines from just off-screen. The action isn't exciting; it's slow, cumbersome and clumsy. It doesn't help that the eponymous skull-head looks and sounds plain goofy, stumbling about from punk to punk squawking about penance and sometimes making strange pseudo puns (\"yee-haw\"?). The whole thing occupies this strange space where it simultaneously seems to be trying way too hard and no-where near hard enough. It's not entertaining - like, at all - but it isn't rage-inducing, either. However, it's so poorly made in almost every area that I wouldn't recommend it, even to fans of 'so bad it's good' cinema (because it's not 'so bad it's good', it's 'so bad it's bad'). It doesn't engage on any level, really. Yee-haw? 3/10"

However, at times the movie became too ambitious and it really made things look corny and fake.\n\nThe idea behind the story was good, but the story that made it to the screen was too rushed and not thought through enough. Considering \"Ghost Rider\" is what I can only imagine as the first of more movies to come, the story should have been primarily about the build-up and the introduction to Ghost rider - who Ghost rider is, more of his background, and not just tell a story which could only be described as a script on speed.\n\nI recommend you watch it, but primarily to check out the cool special effects."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie had one serious problem and thats Mark Steven Johnson. I mean Daredevil was a B- movie at best but this movie is a complete failure on all levels. The script was one of the worst scripts i have ever heard. If there were more anymore cheesy lines, then this movie didn't deserve to hit theaters. Very poor writing and shocks you on how a studio could pass the script and not have rewrites on it.\n\nNick Cage is a talented guy but not in this movie. He was not right for the character and played it as a boring, depressed guy on drugs.\n\nEva Mendes was pleasant on the eyes but thats about it. She didn't play a good love attraction and you don't feel the connection between the two actors.\n\nThe villains were weak and both poorly cast. Peter Fonda is not scary and doesn't come off as evil. His son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) has the looks of a devils son but not the talent. Weak actor for the role. Blackheart is a very dark character that could have been truly scary and villainous with the right actor in the part.\n\nBesides some visual effect highlights, not mentioning the final battle between Ghost Rider and Blackheart which was a visual effects disaster, this movie is a failure on all levels. From the direction to the screenplay to the cast, Ghost Rider is one of the biggest comic book adaptation failures ever."

I think is a great movie and i've watched him with great great interest till the end. I think the special effects was extraordinary, the subject and the role played by Nicholas Cage the same. . . In my opinion the best movies were made in year 2006 and 2007. I'm a big fan of Nicholas Cage and i think this is the type the role that fits to him very good. All the actors in the movie played very well. It is a film that i rate it with 8*. I recommend you watch this movie if you haven't done till now . .. . . Enjoy it !"

Nothing is left of the books dark theme and the mythos of Ghost Rider and Zarathos. Instead of battling Deathwatch/Blackout/Snowblind & Co he's battling the devils son like he was John Constantine. What the hell?\n\nYou can't even watch Ghost Rider trying to ignore all the discrepancies with the comic books, the film is just so bad. What's up with everybody's voices? Couldn't they TRY and make ppl sound cool?\n\nAlso very annoying \u0096 Nicholas Cage. The man CAN'T act! Look at his ten latest films and see for yourselves! He's playing the same part in EVERY film. Also, the use of a famous actor makes the a$$hole director to use him as much as possible. Therefore, throughout the movie, you will see Cage ride his fairy bike in situations obviously more suited for his fiery alter-ego.\n\nThe film just stinks folks, and the best thing about it is Eva Mendes, just because she's beautiful. A good actress with a nice cleavage is always good for a movie."

The direction here is shabby and about the only good thing is some of the special effects are descent especially the more than okay first Ghost Rider transformation and some of the bike scenes. The script is bad an the acting is just as wooden. Nic Cage is rotten and I am beginning to think there is no hope left for him as an actor . The bad guys are nothing to write home about and Peter Fonda is completely wasted as Satan. This should have been the beginning of a great franchise where Johnny Blaze seeks and finally gains some sort of redemption. Instead it was about me holding me head in hands and cringing. Best avoided."

Could have used a lot more action, but what was there was fine with me, showed a small taste of the heroes power. Nic Cage had some small moments where his acting reminded me of the wickerman, but all in all he did a good job.\n\nI enjoyed the movie, it was pretty fast paced, which kept me interested throughout, not really any boring moments. I saw what could have been a plot hole or two but honestly, it's just a comic book movie, I didn't expect it to be a masterpiece or anything. I enjoyed it and I think most of your average movie-goers liked it also for what it is.\n\nThis movie is more on par with Fantastic 4 and Blade:Trinity (the first 2 were fantastic though) than some of the other comic book based films, such as Batman begins, a great movie with dark elements I had expected to be in Ghost rider, which seemed a little bit toned down to me, one of my only complaints was the lack of \"disturbing\" elements.\n\nSo, if you have some free time on your hands and you want to be entertained for 2 hours, enjoy Ghost Rider if you haven't all ready seen it."

        "review_detailed_main": "STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning\n\nComic books would appear to be such a good commercial investment for film makers they're making them left, right and centre nowadays, even these obscure ones that would be simply too violent or scary to make into family adventures. Yes, comic book enthusiasts may suffer at the taunts of the intolerant and ignorant, with cries of 'nerd' and 'loser', but never doubt they're almost unrivalled appeal to the box office consensus. And so we have Ghost Rider, another obscure Marvel Comics adaptation that made it to the big screen. But while The Punisher managed to be a none stop action thrill ride, this effort sadly derails off course fairly early on and never stops from there.\n\nThe plot, for what it's worth, has Nicolas Cage as Johnny Blaze, who as a young man was conned by the devil into selling his soul to him, only for his father to die in a freak stunt-gone-wrong at his carnival. Years later, he's still a daredevil only to sell out crowds in Las Vegas rather than country carny folk. But the devil returns (his name's Mephistopheles, by the way, and he's played by Peter Fonda) and calls on a bargain to free his soul. He must use some skills given to him to take care of his son who wants to take over the world. Instead, he uses them to fight evil, seeing into the souls of the wicked and stopping any future crimes. As events build up to a cataclysmic showdown, he tries to rekindle his romance with teenage sweetheart Roxanne (Eva Mendes) who's now a news reporter, and is given advice and guidance by wisely old man The Caretaker (Sam Elliot.)\n\nReal life comic book enthusiast Cage was an obvious choice for the role, but turns in what is becoming a typically dour performance that brings nothing to the role whatsoever. Mendes is okay as a feisty love interest, but is really just eye candy, while gravelly voiced legend Elliot is sadly equally as fruitless in the wise old warrior role. The only one who really makes an impression is Fonda as the devil, giving it that devilish charm the role requires but the script fails to lift anything higher because of it.\n\nThe film itself is slick, stylish and polished enough and had it been ten or maybe even twenty minutes shorter it might have passed as harmless hokum. Unfortunately the result is overlong inanity, with a weak, apathetic plot, a slack script and poor performances that make it an instantly forgettable comic book disaster.\n\nMark Steven Johnson's previous film was the other comic book adventure, called, appropriately enough, Daredevil. This manages to make that seem like, well, The Punisher. *"

        "review_title": "Alright, but has many problems, especially with its humour",
        "review_detailed_main": "Despite knowing very little other than the basic mythos, I was still rather hyped to see Ghost Rider. I was disappointed at first at the fact that its release date was pushed back from last summer until now, but figured there was a good reason for it. Unfortunately after seeing it, I think they should have held it off even longer.\n\nAs a child, Johnny Blaze does death-defying stunts on a motorbike alongside his father. When he receives word of his father having cancer, he makes a deal with the devil, Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda), to save his father's life. In exchange, he signs over his soul to him to do a job that will not be required until much later in life. Zap forward at least fifteen years, and Blaze (Nicolas Cage) is doing positively insane bike stunts and thrilling crowds all over the United States. At the same time, Blackheart (Wes Bentley) has arrived back on earth, looking for a long lost contract of souls. Only then is Johnny contacted by the devil again to stop him, and becomes the title character.\n\nThe movie itself is not all that bad. The storyline is pretty good, and stays consistent throughout despite the addition of a few subplots. Everything just practically flies by.\n\nBut that is what hurts the film a lot too.\n\nThe origin of Johnny Blaze is done very well, and quite speedily. He is introduced, signs the deal, and is an adult faster than you can say the devil's name. But after that, when it should begin to meander and slow down a bit, it just keeps up the pace and does not stop. Characters introduced part way through and should get more of a chance to do things are just held back, and random moments go on for longer than they should. It feels imbalanced in some sections, and feels undercooked in others. Battle scenes are especially hit, as they last varyingly between a few seconds and a few minutes. If you blink during some of them, you may miss them.\n\nWhich leads us to the next issue: it is too damn cheesy. I understand that comics are very tongue-in-cheek and heavily ironic/predictable. But the movie versions usually have some form of seriousness to them. Here, it is almost all laughable moments, and no sheer moments of seriousness. Just listening to Ghost Rider is like listening to a cheap comedian. A cheap comedian who looks bad ass of course. Lines like \"You're pissing me off,\" and \"Guilty,\" are just too funny for words. But they should not be. This comic book story is dark and morbid in its content, so why is that not reflected in the film? A lot less cheese and a lot more seriousness would have gone a long way.\n\nThe special effects are another iffy area. Ghost Rider himself looks great the majority of the time. His flaming skull head looks natural, and never looks pasted on in any instant. When he jumps on his bike and starts riding is when he looks particularly good, as it is evident that the filmmakers spent extra attention on getting these two details down pat, even during moments of fighting or driving. Clumsily however, when Blaze first transforms into the vigilante superhero, the effects look really terrible and really cheaply done. They still look decent, but in comparison to the easy transformations later on, they stand out as fairly bad.\n\nThe scene involving Ghost Rider and the helicopter has some of the worst effects I have seen in a recent film (although nowhere near as horrendous as the shoddily produced The Brothers Grimm). The deaths that Blackheart is responsible for look okay, but looks the last one he does looks rather obnoxiously edited in. When he and his cronies show off their powers, it looks a hell of a lot better, but nowhere near as powerfully and majestically created as Ghost Rider's.\n\nCage is alright as Blaze. He is very laid back, and acts up at the appropriate times. I think he tried a little too hard to be seen as being younger though, but he does manage to pull it off. His lack of melodramatics (like in the recent World Trade Center) also helps, as he stays grounded in the role, and does not make it out to be a complete joke. When he is Ghost Rider though, as said, it just does not totally work. Fonda and Sam Elliot who shows up off and on, are both on about the same page of being alright. They do an admirable job, but they just do not make the roles anything more than they already are. Bentley on the other hand, really does a good job as Blackheart. He plays him up and is great in this villainous role. If he was handed better dialogue, and had a few more scenes, he would have really become a force to be reckoned with.\n\nEva Mendes however, is very haphazard as Blaze's love interest Roxanne. She does nothing for the movie except for bringing an added hotness to it. Her dialogue exchanges with Cage are alright, but their chemistry is not all that great. She does not seem like she is all in it like the rest of the cast, and just feels like the weakest link (albeit a hell of a lot stronger than Ms. Katie \"Useless\" Holmes in Batman Begins). And despite how gorgeous she is, it really is awkward seeing every shirt (and dress) she wears undone right down to the exact same button, revealing the same amount of cleavage in every single scene.\n\nOn the whole, the film is just alright and nothing else. It could have used a lot more work than it got in that short period between last summer and now. As it stands, it just does not hold a candle to some of the better comic book films.\n\n7/10."

About the worst of them has been THE PUNISHER (2004) \u2013 but now I can add GHOST RIDER to that unenviable list; this is one lame movie (made by the director of DAREDEVIL) which, for all its CGI effects and name actors, really comes off like a cheap 80s \u2018indie\u2019 horror flick! The would-be Faustian plot is ludicrous to begin with, but the vacuous presence of the perennially grimacing Nicolas Cage (an actor I can\u2019t stand) renders it even less interesting (bungling even the potentially cool \u201cGhost Rider\u201d persona); ditto, the motorcycle stunts (it doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019m the antithesis of a sports enthusiast!). Besides, the hesitant love story doesn\u2019t have the effect that it ought to \u2013 while the obnoxious gang of \u2018hellish\u2019 villains provide the final death-knell to the film!

I love the design for the Ghost Rider character.\n\nAnd the climatic fight between Ghost Rider and Blackheart is absolutely stunning. The sequence kept my heart racing and my pulse throbbing. 99 out of 100 people will not be disappointed with that sequence between the two characters.\n\nThe movie is a furiously quick movie that seems to go by in a half-hour, although the movie is 114 minutes (1 hour and 54 minutes).\n\nWhen I walked into the special sneak peek at our theater, honestly, I wasn't expecting much. I was just expecting a clich\u00e9d comic book thriller that would be a cheap, cheesy, B movie that would last in theaters for at least two months, but I was wrong. This is not a clich\u00e9d comic book thriller, and it's not a cheap, cheesy, B movie.

The return of iconic movie greats such as Batman and Superman, the incredible emergence of comic classics like X-Men and Spiderman, and even the creation of new and interesting hero tales such as The Incredibles and Unbreakable are all testament to the Age of the Super Hero Film.\n\nAnd in any such age you're going to get great movies, lousy movies, and OK movies.\n\nThis one joins the ranks of the Hulk and Fantastic Four as an OK movie. It's not bad - it has fine graphics, interesting general plot, and some moments of surprise and humor that make it a good film to have on-hand for rainy Saturday afternoons, when the charm of Power Ranger reruns and new, pathetic Scooby Doo cartoons runs out. But the acting is, at times, pretty bad - aren't we glad Cage didn't end up playing Superman after all! - and the plot is clearly as forced as the average '80s comic - which is what this film was based on.\n\nThe worst part of this film has got to be the villains. Without giving away details, I think I'd have rather seen this movie done in the old style of TV serials, where the superhero faces a number of conventional criminals and realistic situations, rather than facing a group of contrived demons that barely come across as threatening.\n\nThe best part was, undoubtedly, the visual effects. I sincerely had my doubts that they could successfully pull off a flaming skull and a flaming motorcycle, but they did.\n\nIn the end, though, you just have to turn off the gray matter and enjoy the film for what it is - a fun Saturday afternoon flick.\n\nThen, when the kids are in bed, pop in any of the Blade trilogy, to remind yourself of what a really scary supernatural villain could be like."

        "review_detailed_main": "How could a film starring Nicholas Cage, Sam Elliot and Peter Fonda be bad? Lets ask Mark Steve Johnson, the director of this lacklustre cheeseball of a movie. Okay, hes a newcomer to the directing game, but that doesn't excuse how this movie turned out.\n\nI'm not familiar with the \"Ghost Rider\" comic, but this film has done nothing to spur me into getting my hands on a copy. If you were to cross the average episode of Angel or Buffy, with Torque, then the result would be something like this. So if your no fan of those sources than I would not recommend watching this. The lines are so painfully tired and stale your left wondering whether its meant to be an all out spoof. It just seems to move from one embarrassing example of dialogue gone wrong to the next, interlaced with flashy, slow-mo action scenes, which maybe the only thing that stopped me from turning it off.\n\nAs for the performances; it would be fair to say that this movie would come very near the bottom of the resume for most of the main cast. Cage at least puts a little effort in, but is really pushing it for a man of his age to star in a film like this, I mean \"The Rock\" was over 10 years ago! His fancy wig and semi naked flexing in the mirror fail to impress. Peter Fonda puts on a grim face as the Devil, but...isn't the Devil supposed to be scary? As for Wes Bentley, the strange kid from 'American Beauty', couldn't they have found someone more sinister looking to play Blackheart? A little make-up and dark clothing doesn't really suffice.\n\nIf your a special effects hound, then you may get a buzz out of this. If your a fan of cinema, then I recommend you prepare for a disappointment (if you feel the need to watch it). The director seems to think that by throwing fancy special effects, rip offs of better movies and cleavage into a stirring pot, the audience will fail to notice how lazy the film-making is."

The special effects are very good and Nicholas Cage seems to try his best to make this into a complete picture. So, I would recommend it for those who like fantasy and wish to pass some time in a somewhat enjoyable movie that is simply entertainment.\n\nAs far as the movie being great, however, that is quite another question. The script writing seems one dimensional and contains too many past clich\u00e9s to have any real depth. Therefore, do not look for any true depth in character portrayal or in the plot itself. It just isn't there.\n\nMovies that also dealt with fantasy but which had a much better script and therefore depth of plot and character I would say include Spiderman and Hell Boy. Hell Boy was a find for me since I thought the title might suggest a bad script, but I was quite surprised by its depth and quality."

I hope, all that said, when watching this, expect to be placed at the start of the ghost rider story, I know some have said that the film lacks with action, and is slow running, I wouldn't quite say that, there is a fair balance of story, and some great action to crank on the stereo. The storyline is only to properly introduce the origin of the ghost rider, not to bore, so lets hope I'm right and in the long run this is an important introduction piece to a trilogy or something, that would be awesome. I definitely would have given it a 6/10 instead of 7/10 if I didn't think there was sequels to come, but it's bound to happen.\n\n7/10"

I understand that Nicolas Cage is a big Ghost Rider fan but I have always thought his acting is too limited to be able to grasp particular characters well and unfortunately this is one of those times. I think with a stronger actor this could have been one of the best marvel movies. Also if you want an actress who can act forget about Eva Mendes (only good in Once upon a time in Mexico) but if you want some eye candy then by all means cast her. Looking forward to the sequel, just hope they don't forget things from the first movie like it happens in so many other sequels."

He goes totally mental when he changes into the Ghost Rider -- you have to see it! Screaming and laughing while his skin is exploding and burning, it's intense (surprisingly so for a PG13). Sam Elliott is one of my favorite actors and he does an awesome job as well. And Wes BEntley (where has he been?) shows that he remains one of the best actors of his generation. Eva Mendes is hot!!!!! There were so many huge set pieces here -- the biggest one would be a spoiler so I won't give it. But the final fight is awesome, reminded me of Raiders of the Lost Ark with the spirits flying all over the place. Warning to kids thought -- it's scary at times. Pay attention to the rating!"

Gosh what an interesting idea...but THIS telling of the story doesn't live up to what this film could have been. The best part of the film is the Ghost Rider. He just needed a better, tighter story.\n\nI thought Peter Fonda was a perfect cast as Satan choosing Johnny Blaze. It's an ironic cast, which is what made it good. Same with Sam Elliot as the Caretaker. After those two actors, it gets kinda muddled. I like Nic Cage, he has the \"melancoly\" of Johnny Blaze, he just couldn't fully pull it off --- and some of that is not his fault, but the fault of the script. The Roxanne storyline, fell flat for me as well as Blackheart's did. Every time Blackheart and his minions were on screen, I thought of the TV series \"Buffy...\" and they did it better.\n\nIt's sad that this version of Ghost Rider came out the way it did, the story has such potential but I gave it a middle of the road score for the nice graphics of the Ghost Rider and the potential of something better up the road."

The characters makes no sense what so ever and even the villains are not developed and some are just pointless to the plot while not bringing any cool in the action department either. The dialogue is just laughable and not in a good way either and comes of very corny, even the direction is corny. Which is a negative for a Ghost Rider movie. I like Nicholas Cage as and actor and he is basically the only thing that makes this movie semi-watchable. The back and forth plot in this is just irritating to watch and makes you not care for the characters even more. For a movie that had a budget of over 100 million this movie just didn't seem like it and just looked cheap and lazy. Mark Steven Johnson should stop making comic book movies.\n\n4.6/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Johnny Blaze and his father make a living as Evel Knieval-like stunt riders in a carnival. When dad is diagnosed with cancer Johnny is misled into making a foolish deal with the devil, which results in his being cursed to become the Ghost Rider - a supernatural flaming skeleton.\n\nMark Steven Johnson's \"Ghost Rider\" (2007) combines Faust and Spider-Man and mixes in elements of all the variations of the Ghost Rider comics up to the present, including the 50's Western hero, but its main inspiration is the 70s-80s comic featuring Johnny Blaze as the protagonist.\n\nWhat makes Ghost Rider appealing? Well, the only thing cooler than a guy in black leather and chains driving a Harley is a flaming skeleton in black leather and chains driving a supernatural flaming Harley. That pretty much explains it.\n\nSome criticize Nicholas Cage as Johnny Blaze because Blaze is supposed to be about 30 years old, while Cage was around 41. I suppose someone like James Franco would have been better for the role, especially since Franco looks exactly like Mike Ploog's version of Blaze, but Cage does a fine job. Besides, Cage is in great shape and I know guys 25 years old who look older than him. As for Eva Mendes, who plays Johnny's girlfriend, she's ten years younger than Cage and is both voluptuous and adequate in the role.\n\nSome criticize the film as too serious, others as too goofy, but the fact is that \"Ghost Rider\" has the same general tone as all the other superhero flicks released since 2000. It's a serious story for the most part, although completely unbelievable due to the subject matter, with bits of humor thrown in for good measure. In other words, it's neither deathly serious nor a campy goof-fest; it rides the line between these two extremes.\n\nIf all you want out of \"Ghost Rider\" is an entertaining supernatural superhero flick \"Ghost Rider\" delivers and is worth viewing for this purpose. But the film delivers on a deeper level. Here is a smattering of noteworthy elements:\n\nNote that Johnny is misled into \"selling his soul\" to the devil and has to face the negative consequences of his decision. Few people will literally \"sell their soul\" to Satan but we can all relate to the struggle with the evil that exists within our own hearts. If we decide to live according to the inclinations of our lower, destructive, selfish nature are we not, in a sense, \"selling our soul\" to the devil; that is, giving over our lives to evil? (regardless of whether you view the devil as a literal spiritual being or merely as a symbol of potential human evil). Whenever we choose to live according to this lower nature will we not automatically perform evil and, in that sense, fulfill the devil's will?\n\nPeter Fonda as Satan is perfect and entertaining, as is Sam Elliott as the old Westerner.\n\nLove is an important theme in the story. Johnny \"sells his soul\" for love of his father. He didn't do it for greed or some other carnal purpose. This is agape love, self-sacrificial love, love in its highest and purest form, which puts Johnny on God's side (as Elliott's character observes) and makes him a serious threat to the devil's purposes on earth.\n\nWe also witness Blaze's great love for Roxanne and vice versa, as well as Mack's love for Johnny, etc.\n\nThis is contrasted by the total absence of love in Satan's kingdom. The devil hates his son and vice versa. This is a fitting depiction because God is described as love in the Bible; and since Satan has chosen to separate from God and be an enemy, he has naturally separated himself from love and become love's enemy. Hate in all its ugly manifestations is therefore the essence of the devil's kingdom and relationships.\n\nWhen Blaze first turns into the Ghost Rider and goes for a ride in his flame cycle he causes great havoc wherever he goes. You'll note that this is toned down in his later excursions as Ghost Rider. The explanation? Johnny simply didn't know how to control the supernatural hellfire and \"spirit of vengeance\" during his initial conversion.\n\nAlthough it's supposed to be amusing, it makes sense that Johnny would listen to The Carpenters in his down time. Blaze's daredevil lifestyle and his problems with the Ghost Rider curse would understandably cause him a great deal of stress. Listening to Karen's ultra-soothing voice would be a great pacifier.\n\nThere's a great scene of Ghost Rider riding off the top of a skyscraper, whipping his chain in exulting fury, and then riding full blast down the building smashing into the pavement below as police and onlookers observe in total disbelief.\n\nIn the comics Blackheart was the only comic character that ever sent chills down my spine (in Ann Nocenti's Daredevil). I didn't get this feeling from Wes Bentley's portrayal in the film, although there's a hint of that. Regardless, Bentley does a fine job in the role. And Blackheart's ugly wickedness is certainly revealed or demonstrated here and there.\n\nThere's a great musical interlude featuring the Ghost Rider and the Caretaker (Elliott) riding through the night desert for hundreds of miles to San Vengaza. Fittingly, the song is a modern hard rock version of \"Ghost Riders in the Sky.\" (I love that song! Who doesn't?)\n\nThe Ghost Rider himself (itself?) is a triumph of special effects. Needless to say, the film is enjoyable just to look at.\n\nThe film runs 1 hour, 50 minutes, with the Extended Cut running 13 minutes longer. It was shot in Melbourne, Australia, and other areas of Victoria.\n\nGRADE: B+"

I did like the story but somehow wasn't dramatic enough! I mean the young Jonny Blaze makes a deal with the devil out of love for his father. But his father only is on screen for three minutes or so. They should have expanded on this relationship so that the audience would care more about them. The same goes for the love of Johnny Blaze for Eva Mendez's character. It just isn't deep enough. And what about his reaction to the death of his best friend, Mac. He calls out his name and that's it. No moment of grief whatsoever. I am suspecting that a lot of scenes were cut and that I will have to check out the extended cut to see if that will improve things. The \"Ghost Rider\" has always been an impressive and mysteriouscomic book character. In the movie this mystery is completely gone. I think that some comics should stay untouched because most of them don't translate that well to the movie screen. Since the sequel also has failed to bring us a good Ghost Rider film."

And of course, I was excited to see the GHOST RIDER movie adaptation. Sure, I lowered down my expectations because the storyline of \"Ghost Rider\" has been used and overused in numerous films with vaguely similar story lines. I expected for it to be a movie loved with the highest tolerance to criticism. But a disappointing film is a disappointing film. And if it has too little redeeming factors, then there's no reason not to talk about it.\n\nDon't get me wrong, GHOST RIDER would not necessarily make you feel like you're throwing away your money on crap. GHOST RIDER has its moments of utter coolness. The fiery transformations with Gothic angelic chorals on the background, the bits of humor, that hellishly radical bike he rides. I would not have even cared if the storyline would be considered over-used & clich\u00e9, because I already did expect that. But just the overall delivery of the movie itself was purely bland. The movie was fun but disappointing.\n\nIt's no surprise, this film was directed by Mark Steven Johnson, the same guy who directed the Daredevil movie, which also could be considered a failure. well, I guess that's STRIKE TWO! & I don't want to see him directing a superhero/comicbook adaptation movie again. I can appreciate Daredevil with the highest tolerance, and would admit to liking it a little. But it still goes out the same that it was crap, & badly needed to fall on a new director.\n\nThere was no question of the choices for Nicholas Cage to be Johnny Blaze, Peter Fonda to be Mephistopheles, and Eva Mendes to be Roxanne Simpson. They are all superior performers, and very fitting for their roles at that. But the script never seemed to work well with the direction of the film. Many of the lines looked cheesy, mostly due to the editing which had bad timing and monotony of angles, so much so that Nicholas Cage's supposedly memorable lines end up looking like scenes from a bad B-movie. Same with Peter Fonda, who by the scarcity of film projects made him look like a struggling has-been in this movie. There were moments when Eva Mendes was comedically adorable. But her charm (that usually leaves me lovesick) could not save her from ending up looking like a cheap \"face\" in a sad project. At least Wes Bentley was spunky for the role. But his entire look for the film did not carry on a sense of overwhelmingly cool villain. His costume looked like he was spoofing each and every clich\u00e9 from each and every badly-made superhero and vampire movie. His hair & make-up looked more metrosexual than demon, he could not intimidate me and I swear I could easily ward him off with smelly feet and a bad fashion sense.\n\nThe fight scenes were pathetic. Sure, the \"minion\" villains known as The Hidden were cool. But the fighting scenes with them did not excite me. In action movies, nothing's new these days when it comes to fight scenes. But one should at least make it either interesting or at least sensible for the audiences to get a sense of response. Many of the fight scenes in this movie makes you end up mumbling \"Huh?\" or \"What?!\" It's as if some characters were too dumb to stand and wait for a punch to hit them. Giving it credit, the film does make the effort to breakthrough with some kind of originality (with scenes like how he beat his enemy made out of the wind), the problem is, they don't really convince me, as far as I'm concerned anyway.\n\nCGI or Computer animation is this movie's main Ace card. The thing which it heavily relies to. But one should not really be strict in CGI judgment because in the long run, this technology will get old. It is actually how a film uses its technology to create a good movie. Ghost Rider may have fabulous CGI, but there isn't too much innovative and impressive scenes for it to be a step ahead of the usual eye candy.\n\nI cannot deny that there were moments when this movie made me laugh and cheer. But overall, it was a failure, that will stand aside other disappointing classics such as Blade Trinity, Daredevil, and a bit better than that awful Spawn movie adaptation. Oh well, I hope a sequel with a new director could redeem it."

I would list those movies in order from suck to less suck as Elektra (POS), Batman and Robin, Daredevil. The only reason I put Daredevil at the top of that pile is because the other 2 were just completely awful. Back to Ghostrider. This movie starts off very slow. It takes a long time to tell the story, show us some past, etc. And actually, it takes longer than it should to tell the history, and tells it incorrectly vs. the comic books. So far, most of the comic book movies have strayed from the comics themselves, and I let it slide. Afterall, I'm here to be entertained, and watch a movie, not read a comic book. They are 2 separate things, and I don't mind them being different. The special effects in Ghost rider are awesome. I saw it on a DLP projector, and it was perfect. This is what it would look like in real life if you encountered the Ghost rider. Peter Fonda, whose films I generally enjoy, brought nothing to his character. They could have had anyone play his role. I'm not sure if it was Peter, or the direction he was given. The history lesson was slow and too long, and several times cage was playing Elvis playing the ghost rider. when it was all over, the effects were great, and there was enough decent parts of the story that i walked away from the experience satisfied. I didn't expect this to be the next star wars or anything, but I did feel it could have been much better. I'll get the DVD. just don't go into it with any expectations one way or the other, and you should be fine."

No, he acts like Nicholas Cage, not Johnny Blaze, not anyone else he has ever portrayed in his films but himself. Throughout the whole film he never gave me a reason to think he was Johnny Blaze, the ghost rider. Even Matt Long who is the young version of Johnny Blaze did an academy worth performance compared to Cage. Eva Mendes is horrible as well, delivering the same crap Nicholas Cage does. Now other than bad acting, this movie was completely predictable, you can tell what is going to happen each moment that it makes Miss Cleo seem psychic again. Mark Steven Johnson please do not do anymore Marvel movies. Let directors like Sam Raimi do it right. I do not need to go into further detail, this review by itself should tell you not to even waste your money at the theater. This movie probably would appeal to 12 year olds and under."

        "review_detailed_main": "Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) has been a motorcycle stunt rider since childhood, having been trained by his stuntman father. However, when Johnny's father gets cancer, the devil himself (Peter Fonda) comes to make a deal with 18 year old Johnny. He'll cure dad of his cancer if Johnny will sign his soul over to him. Almost before he realizes what he has done, Johnny agrees. However, although Johnny's father is cured, he dies shortly after in a motorcycle accident. Johnny is heartbroken and leaves town, running away from his lovely girlfriend, Roxanne (Eva Mendes). But, the devil tells Johnny he will come for him when he is needed. Flash forward several years. Johnny Blaze is the greatest motorcycle stunt rider in the world, thrilling audiences everywhere, by jumping over helicopters, among other things. Roxanne, now a reporter, arrives to interview him and Johnny realizes he still loves her. Bad timing. The devil comes back to demand Johnny's services as a \"ghost rider\", a person who tracks down the bad guys and gives them a push toward their final destination, hell. Mestophiles also wants Johnny to battle his evil son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) and his gang. If Johnny can defeat Blackheart, the devil will give him back his soul. Whew, what a deal! Can Johnny summon the courage to take back his life? This is an exciting movie, based on a Marvel comic book hero. Cage, a very fine actor as evidenced by Adaptation and Matchstick Men, gives a nice turn as the troubled hero and he looks, well, very hot. Mendes, too, charms the audience with her stunning beauty and sweet demeanor. As the devil, Fonda strikes the right note while Bentley, who always looks creepy, poor guy, was made to order for his role as the devil's son. The look of the film is adequate, with mostly well-chosen costumes, interesting sets, and some nice visuals. However, one does get the feeling that some corners were cut in the special effects department, making the film look cheap when compared to a movie such as the original Batman. There are a few disturbing images, too, rendering the film unsuitable for those under 10. Yet, all in all, this is an exciting ride, especially for folks who love comic books and their superheroes. As an evening's entertainment, Ghost Rider delivers a big dose of thrills and chills."

I thought 'Daredevil' was a fun, action-filled movie and given that Mark Steven Johnson also directed this I had faith that all of the negative buzz was not true. I was wrong.\n\nI'm not exaggerating when I say that 99% of everything in this movie was absolutely terrible. Completely awful. The acting is so tremendously bad that it is a wonder how the auditions for this movie went, if they ever happened at all. Eva Mendes, while nice eye candy, is not an actress in any sense of the word. There is no life behind ANYTHING that she says. The kid who plays Blackheart is so unbelievably over the top that every time he appears on screen gives the audience a reason to laugh. Nicholas Cage is, well...Nicholas Cage. 'Nuff said.\n\nThe ONLY redeeming part of this movie is the performance of Sam Elliot who is wonderful in everything that he does. He must have gotten a different script than everyone else. Speaking of which, the dialogue in this movie is the most drab, lifeless, second-rate fare that most youth theatre performances could put it to shame.\n\nI'm sorry, but did anyone put forth some semblance of soul into Ghost Rider? The special effects were passable. But even if they were awesome, it would not have mattered. This is a blot on the history of comic book movies. I've never read the comics, but I'm certain that anyone who has would find this film to be about as faithful as Brad Pitt was to Jennifer Aniston.\n\nI can only think of one really good word to sum up 'Ghost Rider' : WASTE."

        "review_detailed_main": "As far as comic book titles too often the directors or producers try to present the characters in their own vision. This can at times be OK, I mean let's look at the X-Men trilogy, Spiderman trilogy, Hellboy and Daredevil. All were presented in the director's visions while at the same time capturing the feeling of the characters in their respective environments (e.g. Hellboy's color and cinematography were dead on as far as the comic books go, and to me remains one of the best comic to movie translations ever.) Sometimes even making steps to create a certain realism which would pass off as more true to us moviegoers! To me Ghostrider delivers as well as these other flicks.\n\nGhost Rider is a personal favorite in terms of comic books and novels because of the tragedy which is Johnny Blaze. And Mark Stephen Johnson manages to capture the concept and look, feel and vibe of this great Marvel Character. It even has the feel of an old 70's motorcycle flick! The story revolves around the protagonist Johnny Blaze (Cage) and his life since making a deal to save the life of his father from the ravages of cancer with Mephisto (Fonda). Sticking directly to the comic book and its storyline we move forward many years later where Johnny is now a celebrity biker/stuntman/daredevil and Mephisto comes calling on his end of the deal. He tells him if he will bring down his son Blackheart he can have his life back and their deal will be fulfilled.\n\nAlong the way we see Johnny trying to deal with the agonizing pain of losing loved ones (his father and girlfriend played by Eva Mendes.) To me this was a good part Cage played, and the acting while not the best ever was certainly not bad at all. I'll give it a 7 out of 10."

I was very disappointed. This is just another one of those really cool Special Effects movies with a fickle plot, was poorly directed and weak had a screenplay. It seems like that's all we get now a days. Hollywood if you're listening We're more intelligent than this, at least some of us.\n\nI will say that this movie may appeal to teens and some who live on the edge of society due to it's evil spiritual content but, since it's all so surface, to the enlightened it is downright silly and bordering on offensive."

        "review_detailed_main": "Let's just get one thing clear: Ghost Rider wasn't great but it wasn't terrible either. In the very least it was entertaining. Yes it doesn't compare to Spiderman or X-Men (The Punisher is the best one of them all) but its better than the likes of Daredevil, Hulk, etc. I think people were let down because like myself the trailer had them sold from day one and this release had been marked on my calender for months. As a result of being let down a lot of people are being pretty harsh. I'd recommend seeing this picture if you'd like to, just, be entertained for a few hours. If your looking to see the best action/comic picture ever made then your going to leave pretty unhappy. Nic Cage is one of the best, there's no denying that, I think he pulls off the Ghost Rider character well. For the males out there Eva Mendes is absolutely gorgeous and there's no denying that either. Her character was undeveloped but being just \"eye candy\" in this picture is a quite a stretch. A movie like this disappoints me in a lot of ways but in the end I didn't leave the theater like I did after watching Alexander a few years back. I was irate because the trailer made that one look like something great but it was the biggest waste of time and money that I've ever experienced in my life. Ghost Rider was nothing like that. Disappointed sure, irate no. Ultimately what needs to be said is that this film, at its worst, is an average picture. It's not some atrocity that some people are saying it is. Go see it and you'll most likely respond to it the way I did. Just give it a chance. You may love it, like it or hate it. Everybody's critique is unique. This was a vague representation of mine.\n\nOh yeah, I just wanted to say that Nicolas Cage had his finest performance in his finest film; The Family Man. I don't care what you guys say its the truth. Matchstick Men, Leaving Las Vegas and Family Man, all great movies."

Don't let your brain dwell on the dialogue either. It felt like something out of an 80's action cartoon. I swear I heard Peter Fonda use the phrase \"I want you to destroy him!\" The acting: I love drawly Nicholas Cage as much as the next person, but every time he was on screen, I found myself wishing his skull would catch on fire again. Wes Bently gave the best performance, and had the least amount of dialogue -- That may not be a coincidence. Stunning performance by Eva Mendez's chest. The action: Loaded up with special effects, but horribly unimaginative.I thought one would be able to CG some really creative action sequences with a flaming chain weapon-thingy, but no, he just kind of swung it around a bit. It was pretty disappointing.\n\nIf you could sit through Daredevil or Fantastic Four, you can get through this one. I wouldn't recommend anyone watching it otherwise."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Ghost Rider\" was never my favorite comic book series as a kid but I did enjoy it a lot and overall it was probably one of the better ones. However while the movie adaptation was decent it wasn't nearly as good. The biggest difference I noticed is they took a lot of the darker edge away from the story, which seemed to now cater to a much younger audience in obvious anticipation of boosting ticket sales. This'll undoubtedly work monetary wise but as far as quality is concerned it definitely took a hard blow.\n\nThe film itself is entertaining enough and is kind of cool considering how it blends a mix of genres such as fantasy and western. The acting was okay but some people were completely miscast and not just by how they appeared in the comics but also how they behaved. A grand lesson the filmmakers hopefully learned afterward is that dialog which works in print does not necessarily translate well to the big screen. Some of the one-liners were absolutely heinous and literally made me cringe each time I heard an utterance of either, \"you\u0085innocent,\" or, \"you\u0085guilty.\" Some raw nacho cheese quotes to say the least. The special effects are great, however somewhat overdone. It seems CGI was thrown into just about anything the editors could get their eager hands on and this added to the corny factor as well.\n\nNevertheless I still think Johnny Blaze is a neat character and contains a very alluring back-story. Not to sound trite myself but I really like how the allegory is based on solid morals and life lessons. The main plot is what sets this apart from a run-of-the-mill movie for me. That being how long should an individual have to pay for a stupid mistake? Surely it's not fair to have to suffer for the whole duration of one's life and that's what Mr. Blaze here discovers, that he can't be scared anymore and he must move on\u0085to learn from the past and fight the good fight.\n\nI also can't help but complain about the soundtrack, as that was procured for the teenyboppers too. The one huge exception was when \"Crazy Train\" was blasting during a well-suited stunt that synchronized perfectly. That whole warm up and death defying leap will forever be ingrained in my unforgettable moments of cinema. On the other hand ghost rider's nemeses were wholly unimpressive. The biggest of all disappointments had to be the final fight since it led the viewer to believe there'd be this giant showdown between two titans\u0085well let me just say this idea fizzled fast into one immense letdown instead.\n\nThe irony is that although this film is flawed beyond belief, it's enjoyable and worth watching as questionable as that sounds. My best prediction is that this'll be one of those installments where there'll be a much better sequel as the first in the series usually serves as the establishing point and has to contain the more obligatory conception sequences. True fans of the comic might be a little disappointed but it's by no means a complete catastrophe and any teenager will love it. It appears that \"Ghost Rider\" will be setting down the path of justice after all with this debut, but it might not be the right one just yet."

It is the choice of a fine actor like Nicholas Cage with good supporting roles from Finda and Eva Mendes that makes the combination even more obviously look like badly mixed. Cage's melancholy is disturbing in every scene he is in, but is not convincing and not in tune with the quantity of muscles on his body and the spectacular action around. The ending is badly written, non-convincing, and if it was meant to signal the start of the series it did not ignite at all for me the wish to see the follow-up installments. 'Ghost Rider' is not bad, but is far from the other Fonda motorcycle movie."

I thought the acting was really bad and the movie lacked the emotion get draws you to the screen and keep you entertained.\n\nSome who like the comic-book action-hero type movies might find it entertaining as it does have some pretty good special effects. But thats about the only thing I like in the movie.\n\nThat said it is not that I don't like comic-book action movies I have seen a few I enjoyed, this just isn't one of them.\n\nI love Nicholas Cage as an actor, but this is the worst role I have seen him in. I have seen a lot of movies and if there is a point in having a 1 rate on a scale of 1-10, I think this movie fits the rating as its the worst movie I have seen this year."

Why the producers felt that Nick Gage was the best choice for Johnny Blaze will be a mystery much debated over the years. I am not sure why Johnny became more country as he grew up but I guess Nick is real proud of his over the top Southern/hick accent and he hasn't got to use it since \"Conair\". The producers would have been better served by letting Matt Long play Johnny for the entire film. While Eva Mendes reminds me visually of Barbara Carrera, she lacks Barbara's fire, making all of her scenes with Nick, in a word, boring. The story was certainly appropriate for a comic book, but even DC comics would have avoided the plot holes that permeated this production."

        "review_detailed_main": "Given the early drought of 2007's first wave of movies, it's easy to pick out Ghost Rider as a film you'll indefinitely want to see. And why not? If you've got the main character being a flaming skeleton with a blazing motorcycle, it's hard to resist the eagerness of seeing what action scene they'll take place in. Mark Steven Johnson's latest movie is a lot like his recent Daredevil adaptation in how you might leave the theater. You may walk into the theater expecting something good and fun without much brains, but walk out getting the impression the story was taken serious and that little was utilized in the film.\n\nStunt motorcyclist Johnny Blaze takes on the main role of the film when he signs a contract to save his father in exchange for his soul. But poor Johnny becomes the victim of his own choice when the devil decides to turn the results of the contract around. Fast-forward a few years and Blackheart-the son of the devil-wants to obtain the ultimate form of power; is there ever a villain that isn't greedy? Thus, Johnny is turned into the Ghost Rider at night as the devil's bounty hunter to do his work; in this case, finding Blackheart and stop him from gaining his desired power.\n\nThe plot isn't terribly deep and it's easy enough to follow even with the fair number of plot twists tossed in the film. Like Daredevil before it, Ghost Rider likes to utilize the light-hearted humor and plot with a serious tone. And just like Daredevil, this really becomes one of the film's major weaknesses in how it leads to some very unnecessary scenes and details. Some of the comedy in the film does work, but most of the time you feel like you missed the point or that there was too little or too much effort put into that joke. As for the more serious parts, Ghost Rider tries to make these parts stand out, but they wind up feeling rushed so that the film can get to the next bit of details.\n\nThen there's the characters, who go back and forth between being likable and totally unconvincing. This is especially noticeable in the chemistry between Johnny and the attractive love of his life: Roxanne. While they're both likable characters, the believability between the two goes back and forth between strong and nonexistent. And it's tough to establish just how a character feels when they shift from a comical tone to a serious tone and back to comical faster than I can snap my fingers.\n\nNot to say that Ghost Rider is automatically a bad film due to these flaws, there's still some redeeming qualities. Nicolas Cage, while probably not the best choice for Blaze, usually makes for a character that you'll admire for his tragic flaws as individual. Supporting actress Eva Mendes also makes for some solid scenes with her character, and actually tends to be more believable than Cage himself. Blackheart and Mephistopheles (the devil) typically do well to be charming villains, but they do get rather annoying with their almost sadistic tone after a while.\n\nThere are also a few nice action scenes to experience in the film, particularly in the last hour or so. When the Ghost Rider is doing what he does best it makes for an entertaining and usually exciting experience. Also, the Ghost Rider himself has a few moments that, while containing corny dialog, manages to make them sound cool enough to help make his character all the more likable. And you've got to give it up for a guy with a flaming skull, chain and wicked motorcycle for those more memorable sequences.\n\nThese aspects are nice and do help Ghost Rider to avoid being a complete failure, but most of these moments take place within the second half of the film only. For the first half you feel like your being treated to a bunch of scenes that add little to nothing other than setting up the premise and helping you get used to the characters. Thus you get a bit of that Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest in which the start of the film does little but after the half of the film is gone, the potential is finally being realized.\n\nGhost Rider is by no means a bad film, there's plenty to like in the film, if most of it is because of the film and characters' style. But once the end finally comes, you get the impression that it was a missed opportunity. It may not have as much charm as Fantastic Four or even Spiderman for that matter, but at least you're treated to something of better quality than The Hulk. Proceed with caution, for this is one of those films that you may love for its action and style, but might be disappointed by due to the almost completely obvious flaws."

Seriously, this movie is often hilarious, in ways that make you unsure if he considered the darkness and tone of the source material. Actually, no, allow me to restate that point: it seems like he has read the source material, and only the first, oh, ten or so years of the title. I've read a lot of GR, and one thing that jumped out at me was that this film was almost exactly like an old seventies issue, crappy dialogue, over-melodramatics and all. Case in point: in the book, when Johnny becomes the Rider for the second time, he speaks in thought: \"OH NO... I CAN FEEL IT TAKING OVER... CANNOT STOP... NOW, I AM THE RIDER AGAIN!!\". People who've seen this film will understand what I mean. It appears as though there's been no attempt to seriously adapt the book; it's more of a straight-up transition, and a terrible one at that. The fact that Nicolas Cage wrote portions of the script makes a LOT of sense, as the man's never tried harder at playing the \"tortured hero\" role.\n\nBasically, this had potential to be something awesome: one-part Blade, mixed with a little bit of Constantine, would've rocked. What we get is one-part Van Helsing, one-part LXG, and a whole lot of stupidity. The Rider is fun to watch in action, and is hands-down probably one of the coolest-looking characters to come out of the Marvel stable, yet the brief scenes when he does hold screen are handled too flashily and quickly. Wes Bentley is terrible (for a menacing, powerful demon, he's neither very menacing nor very powerful), and one can almost see Eva Mendes trying to get through her scenes, and to her paycheck, as fast as possible. And Sam Elliot... he's easily the best actor in the film (close second is Peter Fonda, who wisely chose the role with the least screen time), and it doesn't say much for the rest of the cast that he gets to waste his talent delivering such gems as \"Any man who sells his soul for love has the power to change the world\". Even Donal Logue, usually a guilty pleasure to watch in crap films, is risible.\n\nSo, on the whole: great potential, hopeless execution. And the fact that audiences have jumped on it like a dog on a bone will almost certainly ensure that we'll have to endure a sequel.\n\nIt's almost enough to make you yearn for another Daredevil. Almost."

So where is the point in saying \"this is a great movie, because i didn't expect much, and i didn't get much so its perfect!\" thats nonsense.\n\nOkay. Cut to the chase. The plot itself 5/10. Not as good as spiderman or x-men. The acting 7/10 When the actors get a chance to act, they do a reasonable job. characters 3/10 very very poor character work on this movie. Action scenes 5/10 (and this 5 is compared to ALL MOVIES. It is not compared to ACTION MOVIES, then it would be 2/10) And that is the bigges flaw of the movie. The Action or fight sequences are just boring. Spiderman doesn't really have a great plot, but the fight scenes are pretty awesome.\n\nOne last thing i would like to add. some people say its based on a comic book so we cant expect more.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Ghost Rider\" was a fun entertaining film in all the wrong reasons. If a filmmaker like Bryan Singer, Christopher Nolan or Sam Raimi made this film, it would have been more serious and a better quality film. Keep this in mind that this reviewer had not read the comic but is familiar with the character. The comic book could have been as campy as the movie. Nonetheless, this film is amusing in a cheesy 80's action film type way.\n\nIn order to save his dying father, young stunt cyclist Johnny Blaze sells his soul to Mephistopheles and sadly parts from the pure-hearted Roxanne Simpson, the love of his life. Years later, Johnny's path crosses again with Roxanne, now a reporter, and with Mephistopheles, who offers to release Johnny's soul if Johnny becomes the fabled, fiery Ghost Rider, a supernatural agent of vengeance and justice. Mephistopheles charges Johnny with defeating the despicable Blackheart, Mephistopheles's nemesis and son, who plans to displace his father and create a new hell even more terrible than the old one.\n\nIs this a great film? No, but most Arnold Schwarzenegger action films are not quality film-making either. Luckily, you forgive because that is not what you watch a Governator movie for anyway. This was exactly what \"Ghost Rider\" felt like, an 80's action film. There were many cheesy one-liners. Some lame puns were also thrown in there as well. The best parts of the film were the visuals. Ghost Rider was one of the coolest looking comic book characters around, and was someone you could not help but root for. Occasionally it is neat to watch a movie that does not take itself seriously and \"Ghost Rider\" was that film.\n\nThe acting was fifty-fifty, but it is acceptable because it is not the focal point of the movie. Nicolas Cage was wonderful as the main character, Johnny Blaze. Thank God, he did not play Superman because Ghost Rider is more his thing. The highlight was Sam Eliot, who turns everything into gold simply because of his insanely deep voice, as the caretaker. Peter Fonda was convincing as the devil, Mephistopheles. Donald Logue was also very humorous as Johnny's best friend, Mack.\n\nUnfortunately, there were some poor performances too. Eva Mendez was one of them as Roxanne. Her romance with Johnny was not believable at all. Eva Mendez's character was essentially reduced to her cleavage that was shown in every scene she is in. Another disappointment was Wes Bentley as Blackheart. Wes had only one facial expression, just like Eva Mendez, the whole time, and it was somewhat annoying. Nonetheless, with the way modern technology is, Blackheart still looked like a good villain.\n\nIn conclusion, you could do a heck of a lot worse then seeing \"Ghost Rider.\" The only real bad thing about this movie is that it was the opposite of what you would have expected from a \"Ghost Rider\" movie. \"Ghost Rider\" is not trying to win any academy awards; it is just one to sit back and relax with a bowl of popcorn. Do yourself a favor; leave your brain at the door. In addition, leave your inner movie critic at the door as well. You are not going to need either of them. \"Ghost Rider\" is a recommended viewing!"

Besides being terrible in the film, she completely misunderstood her role as a T.V. reporter. The few scenes where she is supposed to be doing a news spot remind me of something I saw in high school auditions from a very nervous freshman. Nothing she did was like a T.V. reporter, and she killed every scene she was in.\n\nThe script is a type of cheesy rivaled only by \"Evil Dead\". Except that you can have a fun time watching \"Evil Dead\", while Ghostrider was just painful. It was as if the lines were pulled randomly out of a hat and the actors were forced to say them with straight faces. I am a fan of Nicholas Cage, but it hurt me to have to see those words fall out of his mouth.\n\nEven the special effects, which were the big marketing tool for this movie,seemed sub par. Particularly when Nicholas Cage transforms. The skeleton is comparative to a cell shaded video game or a claymation T.V. show. And we are expected to take it seriously? The beginning had the intentions of an old romance film and instead pulled off the quality of a modern romance novel. It was clear that the young couple were inexperienced on the camera, but once again, it is not like their lines were worth saying. I work at a movie theater and the reactions afterwords were the same as the \"Harry Potter\" movies. \"Well I had to see it, but man did it suck\""

        "review_detailed_main": "Johnny Blaze began a career as a stunt motorcyclist while still in his teens, taking after his father, Barton Blaze, who has become a legendary stunt cyclist. In one of those bizarre quirks of irony that life tends to display, his father achieves fame by cheating death, only to be diagnosed with terminal cancer and given a short time to live. Johnny makes a deal with Mephistopheles, selling his soul to the devil in exchange for the return of his father's health. Sadly, the devil tends to be a bit of a sneaky bastard, so Barton's health returns wonderfully, and hours later he's killed in a motorcycle stunt. Ouch.\n\nSo now Johnny has no soul, but he doesn't quit cycling. In fact, being an instrument of Satan has a wonderful effect on his career, since Johnny is literally unable to be killed. He performs the most spectacular stunts imaginable and with a level of calm that suggests insanity. He's almost bored as he's leaping over things that other stuntmen wouldn't even imagine trying. Unfortunately, because of his pact with the devil, he also has to transform into the Ghost Rider, the devil's bounty hunter.\n\nSounds like it could be an interesting life, although I can't imagine how many new shirts he has to buy after they get all singed by his flaming head. Besides, he gets to ride through the night on this cool flaming chrome chopper finding evil souls and bringing them back to hell. I wouldn't mind that so much. Hear that, Mephistopheles?\n\nThere is one scene where a mugging victim is being attacked, and the Ghost Rider approaches, stops the mugging and dispatches some flaming justice. It's a satisfying scene, but then later there is a television news crew interviewing the victim, who doesn't appear to be firing on all cylinders. When asked for a description of the man who stopped the attack, she says, \"he was all thin and bony and had a rad chopper with flames and stuff.\"\n\nAnything else?\n\n\"Oh, and his face was a skull and it was on fire. It was an edge look but he totally pulled it off.\"\n\nThere you have sort of the tone of the whole movie. It's about a guy who sells his soul to Satan and becomes a tool of the devil by night, but it's certainly not afraid to laugh at itself, which is important in a movie like this. Besides, when the girl was given that interesting description, the look on the cameraman's face was classic.\n\nThere is also a totally ineffective love story between Johnny and Roxanne (played by Eva Mendez, who seems far too beautiful and sophisticated to fall in love with a stuntman like Johnny). Johnny flees his life after his father's death, leaving Roxanne for years without a word from him, but when a strange twist of fate brings them back together he is faced with the challenge of winning back his true love while also doing something about this pesky devil's slave thing.\n\nYou see, he does that foolish thing that people in half-witted movies like this tend to do - he tries to tell her the truth. He explains earnestly that he sold his soul and now has to work for the devil at night, and he's somehow surprised when she doesn't believe him. I love how he lets her get angry and storm away from him without ever thinking to just show her. I'll tell you this right now, if I'm ever in a position where I have to convince someone that I can fly or travel through time or turn my head into a flaming skull or anything else like that, you better believe I'm not going to do much talking beyond \"Okay, watch this...\"\n\nEnter Blackheart, the devil's son, who is embarking on an ambitious plan to possess a thousand souls and thus release hell on earth. I would have thought it would take more souls than that, but no matter. Johnny is offered the opportunity to anull his contract with the devil if he can defeat Blackheart and send his soul back to hell.\n\nAll this taking and sending of souls gets so tiresome for me, and it may be one of the movie's biggest weaknesses. Buying and selling a soul tends to be something that most people have little experience with, so they offer this explanation:\n\n\"The host can gain control of the possessing spirit through concentration on and manipulation of the fire element that exists within man.\"\n\nHence the flaming head, I suppose. I'm reminded of that classic scene in O Brother, Where Art Thou? where they pick up that kid Tommy on the side of the road with the guitar. He explains casually that he sold his soul to the devil to learn to play the guitar real good, and Delmar asks incredulously, \"For that you sold your everlasting soul?\" Surprised, Tommy replies, \"Well, I wasn't usin' it...\"\n\nI have a feeling that a substantial portion of Ghost Rider's target audience feels somewhat similar about their souls, which may be part of the reason that the movie has gotten such terrible reviews. Yeah, it's goofy, but it's not that bad. Most of the confrontations between Johnny and Blackheart and his gang are fantastically stupid (\"My name is Legion, for we are maaaaaaaaanyyy!!!!\"), but the movie is fun in its own way. Columbia Pictures, at least, certainly wasn't too disappointed with it, because they have now officially green-lit a sequel.\n\nFor some reason this makes me think of the relevance of one of the more interesting lines in the movie:\n\n\"Raise no more devils than you can lay down.\""

Sometimes they were just acting with their eyes. I dug all the camera movements -- this movie had momentum, which was appropriate to the subject matter. Nic Cage is a fantastic (if limited in range) actor and well suited to this kind of comic book *extreme* role. Wes Bentley was great. I really liked the Police Captain and his dark-haired side-kick. (Lots of Aussie actors in this movie as it was shot there.) Eva Mendes was a little disappointing -- I like her a lot but her acting wasn't great (I blame neglectful direction) and she wasn't given enough to do. Plus, her costuming was appallingly poor. There's one time when she's getting back into the car and we see her from behind and her dress is so ill-fitting and wrinkly. Sure, we got to see lots of cleavage (not too much) but dressing a sexy Latina with olive skin in a brown dress that's almost the same colour as her brown hair AND then putting a brown leather jacket on top of that? UGH! Did they WANT her to disappear?! Yeah, I've never read the comics, but I will now."

However, coming out the other end, I wish I had not bothered.\n\nFlaming skulls are cool, no-one is denying that; but this movie is not. Although the first point has been beaten to death, Cage sucks. He's got some good movies, granted, but this isn't one of them. This movie is just lame; the lines are cheesy, the characters are cookie-cut from the dough of Hollywood, and whatever cool fight scenes might have saved this movie are null. I can appreciate not having explosions at every turn in a movie, but this was one where I was consciously bored, waiting for the characters to stop being try-hard and cool and start blowing stuff up to entertain me. The flaming chain whip seemed like it had potential.\n\nBut no. Despite the lead-up to the dispatch of each of the four main baddies, each one is destroyed within a few minutes each. There are no cool drawn-out fight scenes which destroy half the city in the process, but rather the Ghost Rider is given powers so that he can end any fight before it gets good. I described it to my friends as, \"an action movie without the action and twice the lead-up\". Granted, the motorbike scenes are kind of cool, but the fact that the Ghost Rider is seemingly invincible takes any suspense out of it and just leaves you wondering how long until it's over.\n\nYou may think that at least the final fight scene would be cool. You would be wrong.\n\nI could stand this movie if it had action in it - you know, like an action movie should - but it has extremely little. It is minute after minute of lame characters, uninteresting love interests, and boring dialog. The final scene made me cringe more than the entire movie thus far; it was just that predictable.\n\nJust _don't_ waste your time."

The story and concept is great, but the overall execution of the movie was subpar. I've seen other movies that Nicholas Cage and Eva Mendes have acted in, so I can fairly say that the Ghostrider screenplay is totally at fault here. Can anyone say \"Velveeta\"? Some parts were totally cheesy. The editing was poor in some areas. The pace was lackluster and dull--this is my biggest pet peeve about Ghostrider. There were odd, long pauses in the movie. It was like waiting for a punch-line that never came.\n\nI had such high hopes for this movie. I would strongly recommend a remake! Find a better script and a better director...and I'll be there for the next version."

They might have been good for Crank, but the directors either have lost their touch or the formula just didn't translate onto the rider.\n\nBut let us talk about this movie. A fair and balanced story, that has it's clich\u00e9s but has some nice effects to back that up. Good action scenes and a story that works (for those not familiar with the comic books that is). Nic Cage playing a moderate Ghost Rider, which kinda works!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Delayed by almost a year and coming from the director of Daredevil, Ghost Rider was given the death knell by many before even having seen it. Into the equation is that it stars Nicolas Cage, a man whose star has dimmed so badly it's as if Leaving Las Vegas had never been made, Ghost Rider it seems......... had to stink? Stunt motor cycle rider Johnny Blaze sells his soul to Mesphistopheles in exchange for his Fathers good health. Some time later the demon Blackheart comes to Earth wreaking havoc and Blaze is summoned by Mephistopheles to stop him, only Blaze is transformed into the Ghost Rider, a bike riding, chain slinging spirit of vengeance.\n\nGhost Rider is a fun film that sadly is not without flaws, but the comic touches and all round sense of fun, however, should not be understated, so much so that if people go into it with the expectation of a light and breezy comic book picture, then there is enjoyment to be had. The character of Blaze/Ghost Rider is wonderful in the extreme, Blaze doesn't drink alcohol, he instead drinks jellybeans out of a glass. He listens to The Carpenters and gets much amusement from watching chimps doing karate, this is a man who on his motorbike leaps the length of a football field over rotor whirling helicopters! Then Blaze becomes Ghost Rider, a maniacal mass of flame and one liners, an odd character when one thinks he works for the devil and makes his mantra one of striking down evildoers! And it's with that cheeky daftness that one needs to view this movie.\n\nNicolas Cage actively sought out the role of Blaze due to his immense love of the source, and there is no denying that he puts guts and kudos into the portrayal. He perfectly camps the comic book nature of Blaze, whilst revelling in the devil may care side of the Ghost Rider persona. However, Cage is the only one who can come out of the picture with any credit, female love interest falls in the hands of Eva Mendes, perhaps her Roxanne Simpson character is a little underwritten, but her screen presence is more annoying than memorable. Peter Fonda is very poor as Mephistopheles, about as scary as someone making Easy Rider 2, yet compared to Wes Bentley, Fonda looks like Oscar gold. Bentley is Blackheart, and he struggles with delivery and any sort of nasty aura in which to breath life into a potential bad guy to savour, and as for his cohort minions? The less said the better I think.\n\nIt's a shame the villains are so poor because there is a lot of care and attention here from Cage and director Mark Steven Johnson, both men whom are clearly in love with the source material. Ghost Rider is certainly a fun experience, and it scrubs up well on Blu-ray, but you may want to repeatedly punch the casting director in the face come the end of the picture. 6.5/10"

He signs a contract with Mephistopheles to give his soul for the health of his father. Johnny learns the hard way that the devil has a few tunes up his sleeve. Although his father is cured of cancer he dies in a stunt accident.\n\nJohnny leaves the stunt show and his girlfriend Roxanne. He knows deep down the devil will come calling for him one day to fulfil his contract. Johnny goes on to becomes a famous stunt cyclist who has survived many scrapes, I think Johnny knows why. His ex-girlfriend has become a TV reporter send down to cover his latest daredevil stunt.\n\nHowever Mephistopheles steps in who wants him to slay his evil son Blackheart and in doing so he will be released from his contract. Johnny Blaze becomes the Ghost Rider and his motorbike goes like a bat out of hell.\n\nThe flaming visuals are cool, Cage excels as the Ghost Rider who acts more like a vigilante saving good people from bad. Its just the the plot is humdrum with supporting characters being wasted. Eva Mendes is there to look pretty. Peter Fonda is just there to look cool. Sam Elliot is there for his moustache and that horse ride alongside with Cage before he bizarrely bails out of.\n\nWes Bentley does not bring much as Blackheart apart from a generic son of a devil act.\n\nIts an adaptation of a Marvel Comic which Marvel Films might have been able to do something more substantial with if they had made the film rather than just be associated with it like The X Men movies. Cage is hampered as Blaze with a distracting wig although he tries to make his character playful but its really an average time-waster."

I should have immediately known that this was a bad idea when I saw Norbit playing in the Director's hall next to Ghost Rider.\n\nI stuck with it, and managed to sit through the nearly 2 hours of film, and I have to say, I have seen worse movies. I must also say, that I saw much better movies.\n\nOne of the big problems (besides the script, and the lack of vocal range on Mr. Cage) is trying to cram too many villains into an origin story. Origin stories, by necessity need to start slow. To jump into the action right away would destroy the tone a good origin sets. This movie sets up a Great origin story. And did fairly well, until Mr. Cage rolled into the scene. From there, it becomes a garbled mess, as not one, not two, not even three, but 5 villains are put into the mix. Entirely too many villains to be introduced, established, and then dispatched, especially considering a good portion of the first half of the movie is Origin material. The result, is more akin to a severe beating, then to an exhilarating ride.\n\nIt was a joy to see the flaming skull on the big screen, and I hope, that if a sequel does get made, that they learn from their mistakes. Tighten up the script, and fix the pacing issues. Oh yeah, and teach Mr. Cage to add some new Vocal inflections, make him seem a little less robotic."

Ghost rider imitates the everlasting battle between good and evil through a past and present legend for legends are a way to understand things beyond our knowledge as said by the movie narrator. It has action sequences, suspense, and a love story that leads to nowhere \u2013but still fun to watch. Being a super hero (apparently a fact neglected by reviewers) it's all it's supposed to be \u2013FUN.\n\nThe film is based on a comic character of the same name appeared in Marvel comics, the story starts with Barton and Johnny Blaze, a father and his son performing death defying motorcycle stunts, Johnny being in love with Roxanne (Eva Mendes) decides to leave town to be with Roxanne who is sent by her father to live away with her mother but Johnny accidentally finds out about his father's medical condition and the fact that he was diagnosed with cancer, trapped in anxiety Johnny becomes an easy prey for Mephistopheles ( Peter Fonda ) who offers to cure Barton Blaze's cancer and have Johnny's soul in return and tricks Johnny into signing this contract. Years later Johnny becomes the most famous stunt rider known for cheating death and surviving killer stunts and that's where the action kicks in. Johnny Blaze is summoned by Mephistopheles to retrieve the contract of San Venganza , a thousand souls worth contract and prevent it from falling in the hands of Blackheart (Wes Bentley) his own son ,despite Johnny's disapproval he is turned into a ghost rider by night with furious powers and no mercy at all. Returning to himself in the morning Johnny meets a man called the caretaker (Sam Elliot) who lives alone in a cemetery chapel reveals important information and answers Johnny's unspoken questions of the mission awaits him.\n\nThe Characters are well cast; Gothic Makeup and dark outfits were used by actors to resemble the evil looks needed for their roles. True no one will get an Oscar here for their performance but Johnny Blaze the ghost rider who tries to defeat his fear, the cold pure evil son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) and Roxanne (Eva Mendes) reporter still in love with her childhood sweetheart, all seemed believable to me.\n\nCinematographer Russell Boyd relied on black foggy scenery creating the perfect mood and feeling of the old American west. As for effects, amazing computer generated visual effects were designed on a shot by shot basis to create Johnny Blaze's skull flames which turns smaller and blue to display any emotion other than rage. As for the ghost rider's voice manipulated by academy award winner sound designer Dane Davis, it was described by director Mark Steven Johnson as \"deep, demonic, mechanical lion's roar\" a precise description I thought.\n\nFor all superhero movie fans, this one is worth watching."

The always dependable Sam Elliot existed only to provide exposition, and Donal Logue's character, which should have been some emotional grounding to the story, popped in and out of the story with very little reason to do so.

That is the only positive thing I could say about this movie. Like the movie Daredevil, the wrong actor was placed to play the main character, Johnny Blaze. I am not saying Nicolas Cage is a bad actor---far from it. However, he should not have been chosen for this part. Whoever chose him should be fired. Remember, Michael Keaton was chosen to play Batman and he was a good actor but as Batman, he sucked. It was not until Christian Bale was chosen to play Batman that you could really see what Batman was about. Also, the last Batman movie in \"Batman Begins,\" the story was told in a serious and thoughtful manner. Previous Batman movies were campy and just stupid. Ghost rider, unfortunately, follows those terrible Batman movies by being campy and just stupid.\n\nIn this movie, Nicolas Cage was comical.

That's all well and good, but there was too much history. In my opinion much of it could have been cut out. On top of that I felt absolutely no connection between the actors. I was hoping for Cage to show up asap. He didn't - not his fault.\n\nNicholas Cage saved the movie. It would have been a B rated flick at best without the monumental ability for Cage to fill the entire big screen and carry the entire script. NOTE: I didn't say \"carry the entire cast\" b/c Peter Fonda, Sam Elliott, Brett Cullen and Donal Logue all did fantastic jobs in their respective roles. They just weren't melded together well.\n\nWes Bentley, as Blackheart, seemed at home in this role. But I was glad that he wore a scarf to cover his chest - if the chest was open then the entire movie would have seemed cheap. Matt Long only has talent for soap operas. (Then again Jack Nicholson was the worst actor ever when he started out, so ...)\n\nEva Mendes totally belongs on a romantic comedy set. The little snippets where she gets to perform a bit of comedy made me \"fall in love with her.\" She pwns romantic comedy. NOTE: Raquel Alessi is not related to her in any way - other than she looks like Eva's sister! I thought she loved Johnny more than her older character played by Eva.\n\nThe cgi of the skull on Cage's shoulders was well done when he spoke, but it looked awkward in place. However, the flames were awesome.\n\nOverall I only give the movie a 7 out of 10.\n\n-LD\n\n____________________________________________\n\nmy faith: http://ww.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/\n\nPS: I rented the DVD from NETFLIX and got to listen to the producer's (Gary Foster) commentary. At first I thought that I would listen (this was my first DVD) for a chapter or two ... 28 chapters later I was glad I listened to it. I tried the other commentary - don't try it - stay with Foster, an articulate young man with a heart."

It's certainly not the worst I've seen, and it did have some very funny moments.\n\nUnfortunately, the melodrama was laid on disgustingly thick, the acting was terrible (Cage was decent, but the rest of the cast was either completely inept or having a bad year), the special effects were sub-par considering the quality most CG-based movies are attaining now, and the plot was just generally uninteresting.\n\nThe worst thing about this movie, the one that really drags it down and keeps the entertainment value low, is the complete predictability of every character and situation. Stock characters abound, and you never see anyone doing or saying anything inspired, interesting or even remotely insightful. Basically, the plot as well as the characters lack depth.\n\nA prime example is the beginning of the climactic fight (which, by the way, you'll see coming a mile and a half away). It's painfully scripted and (even in context) pathetically unrealistic.\n\nThis is a popcorn flick -- not a good one, but a popcorn flick. Watch it for the no-talent eye candy and the amusing lines and deliveries by Cage, but do yourself a favor: Wait until it hits the dollar theatre."

Unfortunately, Cage only provides a series of his fun character in this movie while at other times, it's pretty monotone. The special effects are also somewhat on the weak side. However, the storyline and the delivery are mostly interesting, entertaining enough to capture notice. Nicholas Cage does add much needed charisma to the movie and the emotional romance while fairly traditional is maintained with the expected level of twists and turns. Some of the superhero battles are not all that sophisticated nor fantastic, barely making the grade. Overall, it was a pleasant movie-going interest, if not a great one. Six out of Ten Stars."

Sure, Nic Cage does his overacting thing that he likes to do a lot, and I can understand people being turned off by that. But, honestly, if it wasn't for Nic Cage's crazy antics, I don't think this movie would really be watchable. He brings a lot of, let's call it \"enthusiasm\" to the role and is having fun with it which I really like to see. If you want a fun, don't think too hard, entertaining action flick, there's a lot worse options out there than this one."

The casting is TERRIBLE. The script is COMPLETE TRASH. The soundtrack SUCKS. The acting is Horrendous, though I think it is not so much the actors' fault as the director and scriptwriter. The only parts of the movie that were even redeemable in any TINY fashion were a couple funny lines that had absolutely nothing to do with the movie at all. Honestly folks, I would almost never do this, but really, really, REALLY, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME or YOUR MONEY!!!

IMDb cost me 7 bucks with one of its users review which rated this movie at a 10 and said it could \"stand toe to toe with the original Crow or the original X men movie\". I'm guessing that was the director posting that comment... because this movie has the face only a mother could love. I would post up a spoiler about the dialog but there's no dialog to spoil. Seriously if you've seen the commercial you get the hang of the entire film. Another thing I will warn you of is that this movie doesn't contain action scenes. There's no reason for the bad guys in this movie seeing as how they disappear as soon as they're introduced in the most mundane ridiculous fashion. The CGI is also horrendous, I've seen better work on a sci fi channel production. The only reason I could think of to watch this film is to pick away at it's many many flaws and deficiencies but there are so many that even that gets tiring quick. My advice is in the immortal words of Bruce Campbell \"ITS A TRAP... GET AN AXE\""

Meanwhile Mephistopheles is threatened by his son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) who wants to take over. So Mephistopheles proposes to release Johnny from the contract if he defeats his son.\n\nThere is a lot of background to go through. The first act is a mess of different actors and many characters. I think a lot of it is unnecessary. Also the powers these characters have are pretty random. This is directed by Mark Steven Johnson, the same guy who directed Daredevil.

I have only read about one comic book about this classic legend and so know very little about the comic book hero itself (provided that I read the comic at a much later date hence mentality and emotional stimulation has evolved or devolved since the time period it was created.) Once again my \"friends\" have recommended a movie thats not worth almost anything. The acting was typical Nick Cage movie style so I wasn't shocked by it but I was shocked by the alarming rate his status as a movie star is going down. I am not ashamed to admit that I had gotten a pirated copy of the movie (because I could not bare to bring out seven dollars for a movie worth even less than three dollars). The copy was indeed horrible and people keep telling me that the movie was very good. I decided that perhaps the quality of the movie print somehow took away from the movie itself and so I decided to rent the DVD. I should have left that fact unsolved so I did have a much higher opinion of Nick Cage but now that I saw it twice and it was still the same level of sewage material (my apologies to all G-rider movie lovers and Cage fans) that almost made me blind. The acting is passable, the villain was hollow and the love story was as pale as legions face (cant remember the villains actual name before the transformation and don't care to). The, hero when transformed into the flaming skull, had as much personality as a..a.. corpse (and not much better as Nick Cage either)and the action sequences were lamer than usual. This movie should be displayed in Cage's funeral to show the struggles he had in his Hollywood career. Simply put: this movie sucks as hard on any video print (quality) and no nostalgia (if I ever get into reading the comic) will ever make me buy this movie again. NEVAR!!!! I mean wtf? Here you have a rip off Death, might as well add a scythe in his hand so the weapon could have at least carried the film by itself."

I would have like to see more of the demons work but maybe time and money was an ingredient. Pity! Not too sure about the love interest, didn't gell for me. But on the whole this was a good way to spend some time it kept my interest and loved the fire effects. Sam is one of my favs and I enjoy his laid back acting style in all he does.

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay. I love Nicolas Cage. I love Ghost Rider comic books. Now, did I love the movie? Well, I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say I really really liked it. For the next couple of weeks or maybe month, it'll stay with me strong, but over time it'll slowly enter the \"average\" rating. Well, let me give an overall rundown of the movie and its pros and cons.\n\nPros: Nick Cage was great as Ghost Rider and his transformation into The Rider was just about perfect. The general atmosphere of the movie was extremely well done. it perfected the dark, mystic comic book look. It was extremely stylish during night scenes, or when The Rider came out. Blackheart and his gang looked really bad ass and I definitely got a boner when I first saw them on screen. Wes Bentley's performance is kind of a mixed bag. On one hand I liked it b/c of the look he gave Blackheart, but on the other hand I didn't like the way he talked. I can't explain it, judge for yourselves. I liked the way he killed ppl, but it got old quickly. Anyways, one of the highlights of the film is Donal Logue's character, where most of the comedy comes from. He plays Johnny Blaze's sidekick in the motorcycle business and best friend in life, and his presence on screen almost takes away from Nick Cage's bad-ass persona. also, the film picked up pretty fast. the exposition was quick but very enjoyable to watch. When Matt Long's Johnny Blaze turned into Nick Cage's Johnny Blaze, i was kind of sad to see Matt go. he was charismatic and characterized by young love, and it was sort of sad to see that young loverboy go away. And this is coming from someone who is a #1 Cage fan.\n\nCons: Though Blackheart and his gang look bad-ass, they really aren't. They seem to go down without a fight, which is depressing, for I was hoping these super cool villains would provide a good battle and some interesting special effects. In general I liked the special effects, but sometimes the action of the movie was less like action; the effects and adrenaline of the movie derive from Blaze riding his motorcycle, such as climbing up a building or driving in the water. very cool to watch, but I think the audience was hoping for a little more resistance from his enemies. Also, there were, as suspected, a lot of corny lines. But i mean it's a comic-book film, it should be expected. Actually, in my opinion, I kind of liked the corny lines. But i have a feeling others won't feel the same as me.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed the movie and it fueled me for a couple of days and I am still thinking about it now. Though I see its flaws, I can look past them and realize that not every movie is perfect. And in regards to the chance of there being a sequel...Let's Ride! ;)"

This is not going to win any major awards, but it's just a fun movie based off a comic book that one could easily enjoy on a rainy Friday night.\n\nThis film is about a stunt bike rider named Johnny Blaze. The devil himself gives Blaze the power to hunt down demons who escaped from hell and send them back to the depths. His mission in this movie is to rid the world of Blackheart, who wants to control all souls.\n\nThe acting is pretty good, if not a little over-the-top. Nicolas Cage really played Johnny Blaze well. Eva Mendes is a good actress as well as eye candy. But I truly enjoyed watching Sam Elliot as the cowboy and Wes Bentley as Blackheart.\n\nOverall, this is a pretty enjoyable film with great special effects.

        "review_detailed_main": "At first, I had little expectations for Nicholas Cage being Ghost Rider and I found that many others agreed. The Ghost Rider Comics are famous and just like Spiderman and X-Men, to make an adaption out of it requires a lot of work. It's not something you can just slap on the big screen; both longtime fans and newcomers have to find the same power that makes Ghost Rider what it is in the comics, on the big screen. So having seeing the film I admit that although it had a few sore spots and kinks, I admire the work put into the movie.\n\nThe cast did a decent job on pulling the characters together. Kudos to Nicholas Cage for his part as Johny Blaze: not too shaby, he didn't over do it and it was enough to both respect the character and add a little spunk to it. Eva Mendes also did a good job as being the clich\u00e9d lost teenage love, although the shirts with the top three buttons unbuttoned was way to obvious. I was satisfied with Peter Fonda's work as Mephistopheles, I just wished he put a little more effort as being the vile demon himself. The rest of the cast only added to the nice effort of a movie that Ghost Rider is. The only faults were the lack of character that the film had. Sure there the main cast carried it, but because the plot was so straight forward, there wasn't room for extra characters to weave and twist the story a little.\n\nAs said before, the plot was just like an average comic book storyline. A decent interpretation of Ghost Rider and his ideologies, the film should be claimed as a fair success. The soundtrack was great, with a couple of dull scores though. All in all, if you're a dire fan of Ghost Rider it really is a cool action flick to watch and if you're just wanting a quick straightforward ride, then it's a taker too."

However, the fluidity of the main character throughout this movie was just as poor as the lines he had. Ghost Rider's movements were not very smooth; it looked like this character was made with the special effects from about ten years ago.\n\nDo yourself a favor, and wait until this movie comes out on DVD. By then you will have had a couple of friends that had seen the movie, and they can try to detour you from renting it.\n\nI had every intention of enjoying this movie, despite the somewhat low rating it received on this website. (Note to self, never doubt IMDb's ratings ever again!) However, when leaving the theater I was amazed that it had gotten the 5.9 rating that it did. That's basically why I gave this movie a 1, to counter act the 31% that gave this movie a 10. (I'm glad I'm not one of those deprived souls;>) This movie actually deserves about a 3 or 4. Yes, it really is that bad. I just hope this little spill will save someone a couple hours of their life, much less the $15 you'll spend at the theater. If I can do that, my time spent writing this thing up will have been well spent."

How about you?\n\nThe latest version of a Marvel comic to film is here, and I must say, while I feel it could have been better if targeted primarily at adults rather than teenagers, I still enjoyed it enough to leave satisfied. The movies core audience is going to be teenage boys seeking action, not adults who are looking for a darker thrill ride. While certain parts of the movie do show the possibilities for what it could have been, it is mostly kept to a lighter style. The acting is OK, if not somewhat cheesy given the material, and the special effects are rather well done. Johnny Blaze, to my understanding was supposed to have been a Bourbon drinking tough guy after all he had been through by the time the devil came to collect on their deal, but here, he is portrayed by Cage as a softer, gentler, sensitive if not quirky man who eats jelly beans out of a martini glass rather than drinking. All this leads back to my earlier remark about the target group of ticket buyers, if this movie had been aimed at a slightly higher age group we might have gotten something a little more along the lines of the Crow, or Sin City. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy it as is, just that it could have been something that I, as an older more mature viewer might have liked a bit better. Still, a good time can be had if you need a fun flick to go see."

When you watch the movie you can find yourself disappointed for not driving such a machine.\n\nAccording to my understanding the story was captured from comic book Marvel. All the heroes are bad guys, they sell their souls to Satan, they try to sign an immoral contract with him. They are egoist and they live on the edge to the hell. What a nice attitude that they are trying to get back their own soul. If they can take back the other bad souls to the hell, they will be successful to win prize. It is their own souls. Bad guys are fighting with each other.\n\nWe will be able to see the second part of Ghost Rider in the near future. In the normal conditions, he must take his soul and stay with Eva Mendes. But he chooses the power and refused Eva Mendes. What a poor guy. You should get married with her, have children's and earn your family's life. Do you think that you are the one who will save the world? Do not make me laugh. Take into consideration what I told you and deserve Eva Mendes, okay."

This movie had so much potential and fell extremely short. I was expecting a VERY DARK movie that I waited quite awhile for and instead I get \"Ghost Rider\" - a light-hearted tale with a cheesy love story.\n\nI saw the movie and was shocked, I wanted to leave halfway though but I paid $9.50 so I had to stay. To tell you the truth I kept hoping it was going to get better but it didn't. The movie has great foundational ideas about coming to grips with the \"darkness inside of you\" and if \"executed correctly\" could have been better than Batman Begins - but they took a very adult storyline and tailored it to seventh-graders.\n\nBy \"seventh-graders\" I mean this: the dialogue had no \"big words\" and no intellectual depth; the characters act as if \"a flaming skull-demon-man\" isn't the scariest damn thing they have ever seen (i.e. there is even a joke about the flaming-skull during the movie); the \"demons\" in the film look \"scary\" at different points for no reason, it doesn't fit the tone of the movie, I can only guess it provides a \"quick trill\" to the little kids watching; Eva Mendes bouncing breasts were particularly annoying in the movie and undoubtedly fueled the fantasies of countless hormone imbalanced teenagers, Mendes' breasts are LITERALLY at the center of the screen in EVERY SCENE and her shirt is frequently unbuttoned at least one or two buttons too far which I guess helps provide a distraction to her melodramatic-soap-opera acting style during the film; Matt Long (Young Blaze) is also a horrible actor and ruins the first part of the movie, which sets up the rest of the film to be as equally hard to watch.\n\nI will not go into depth about about the different parts of the film I thought were horrible since this is not a \"spoiler\" review. I will tell you that if you are expecting a good movie that \"Ghost Rider\" hits very far from the mark. If you can stand the cheesy jokes and melodramatic love story then this film is probably for you; but if you are looking for X-Men, Batman Begins, or Spiderman type quality then this is not your movie."

I am also a Nicholas Cage fan but was very surprised not only to see how his acting has deteriorated over the past films, but the fact had he accepted this role with such a poorly written script and previous flops in the box office. The acting was horrendous from almost every actor especially Eva Mendes. There was no connection between the characters to make the audience feel the acting was natural. The film ran way too long and I watched several people leave the theater half way through it. The first half was slow with no substance and didn't start to pickup until half past. I remember thinking the whole time that I would benefit more from this movie by closing my eyes and taking a nap. I've never been so upset at a Marvel movie much less Nicholas Cage (for taking this role) and how this movie seemed to get pushed through without anyone screening it to realize its crap. I even bought the Hulk when it came out on DVD just because it was a Marvel movie but this is certainly one that will not go on my shelf. IF ANYTHING, wait until this comes out on DVD. It's not worth the wait or the hype (if there even is hype after opening day)."

Frankly, I found the character of Ghost Rider incredibly fascinating for a comic, but it simply couldn't work as well as a movie.\n\nNot to say that the movie was terrible. I rather enjoyed it. I can't say I wasted money or time. I just expected more.\n\nThe plot line was very bland. I won't give it away but it was just bland and predictable.\n\nThe casting wasn't horrible, I guess. There's too many people besides Cage I could imagine playing this role, but he did alright. Eva Mendes as the girlfriend was pretty good, though nothing Oscar worthy. Donal Logue as Johnny Blaze's BFF was alright, I guess, for a minor character. He did seem to have more life that Cage at times. Peter Fonda played off the role of Mephisto way too...\"typical-demonic-bad-guy-like\" Imagine the dude who played Dracula in Van Helsing only older. I was really hoping for a freakin awesome Mephisto, since he's one of my all-time favorite Marvel villains. Blackheart was...eh. See, I never read about Blackheart, so I don't know if he's supposed to be a cocky diva (which he is in the movie). He's dark and awesome...but not often.\n\nThe best actor in this film was The Caretaker BY FAR!! Sam Elliott hit a homerun wih this smaller role, which he could've done with just his voice. Whenever he was in a scene, I got a little more excited for this film.\n\nThe worst part of the movie was Ghost Rider's skull. I'm sorry, but I was worried that this would happen: you can't make a flamming skull talk and have it look real OR cool. It was just...ugh. The rest of the special effects were top-notch and even really breathtaking at times.\n\nThe final fight wasn't as cool or epic as any Spider-Man or X-Men fight, but it fit and made sense with the rest of the plot. So...yeah.\n\nAll in all, this movie was good. I'm a die-hard Marvel fan (though I never read a GR comic in my life, thus I am ashamed) so this movie really worked for me. However, though I may buy it on DVD when it comes out for a few cool scenes and the blooper reel, many people may leave confused, disappointed, and maybe even a little ticked off."

I think he did a very nice job on Daredevil(most of the less-than-great in the theatrical version was fixed in the Director's Cut). Realistically, I don't fully understand why he was given another chance, as that didn't do all that well, and it's very unfortunate that his next effort wasn't any better than this is... frankly, in a lot of ways, this is inferior to DD. Let's get the good said. Cage isn't half bad. Neither is Mendes, though their chemistry is questionable. Those playing the young versions of the two leads are reasonable. Humor in this is decent enough, in amount and fun factor alike. Pacing is fairly even, and I definitely wasn't bored during this. The music is almost invariably cool and fitting. The Penance Stare is quite nicely done. From there, it all goes downhill, at a speed the Rider would envy. The acting is, at times, lacking, including for the names who have proved themselves elsewhere. Dialog, as with other areas of the writing, holds clich\u00e9s. There are holes in the script and plot. Any movie has the right to make up its own logic, but it is then under an obligation to remain true to it, unless there is a point to it not doing so. The CGI is OK, and some of the visuals are attractive, although this has next to nothing memorable to it(that refers to this as a whole, sadly). Honestly, while this is an origin story, there could have been more action, and what there is, varies. The villains were interesting, however, they were defeated in dull and unimpressive ways. I was also not sure what the limits to the powers were, and I didn't always \"get\" the intentions of characters... including the hero, and that probably has to do with his lack of eyes. The similarities to the Spawn flick in no way help this. There is little, if any, language in this, the horror, disturbing material and violence are relatively mild(I agree with the PG-13 rating for this), and there is no sex(beyond a tad of eye-candy). I recommend this to those who watch every graphic novel film, and/or fans of the subject of this, who want to see him depicted on the silver screen, whether or not it's the best portrayal. Oh, and motorcycle enthusiasts, they may get a kick out of it. 6/10"

His portrayal of the character is decent, although I did find a lot of the dialogue, particularly whenever they would start the whole \"is this my destiny' style monologues, very tedious and clich\u00e9. And this was certainly not Eva Mendes' best movie, although you think the director wanted it to be considering the ridiculous number of nice-and-close shots of her. Her character existed entirely to be a reactionary person to Cage's lead, which gives her almost no depth and masks what skill Mendes has behind the 'ooh, save the pretty girl' device. Cinematographically, it wasn't bad. I didn't see as many painful homages to other Marvel movies as we saw in Daredevil, although I might need a second look to confirm that. The effects seemed fine to me, although personally the skull CG didn't seem quite to par with the fire effects. All in all, it's a good 'turn off your brain' popcorn movie, but it's certainly not going in my top 10."

The effects were pretty well done, and since the \"rider\" is mostly CGI, Nic Cage doesn't have many lines (always a bonus). As for \"the rider\" He is pretty awesome on screen. He also has little lines which is appropriate since \"the rider\" hardly spoke in the comics. I have heard the director referred to as the \"next Joel Schumacher\". Schumacher single handily destroyed the Batman series (to be revived by Chris Nolan). Mark Steven Johnson, who directed Daredevil also, which I did not enjoy because of Ben Affleck, not because of the director. If you go into Ghost Rider and let go, and not take it seriously it is a fun ride. If you expect it to be a realistic movie (like Batman Begins, or even Spiderman) then you are going to be disappointed. Enjoy the special effects, somewhat decent plot, and cool villains and you have a pretty cool movie. Eva Mendes is also fantastic as the heroine. She is very spunky, and adds appeal to every movie she is in. Without her, I feel the movie would lack in some appeal. Overall I give it a 6.5/10. Considering it opened with $44.5 million in its first weekend, there might be a sequel. After all, in the comics there are 2 separate men who become a Ghost Rider. Stop being so hard on this movie people, and lighten up. Ghost Rider is an action packed, well shot, stunt filled, special effects laden mindless fun! Ghost Rider is one hell of an Anti-Hero!"

The only elements I enjoyed were the ones that pleased the eyes more than anything which were the special effects and Eva Mendes. I'm not gonna lie, her first appearance on screen is worth the price of admission if you thrive on nothing else from this film. Nicholas Cage I thought was a good choice for Ghost Rider. The film has some great comedic elements (intentional as well as inadvertent). The scenes with Sam Elliot definitely make up for the sour parts of the film (i.e. Blackheart). Casting Sam as the original Ghost Rider was the best decision the casting directors made. Overall, it's worth seeing if you're a big comic book fan and don't enjoy spy thrillers since the only other good film out right now is Breach. Whatever you do, if you're looking for comedy, see this film b/c you'll probably get more laughs from it then you would from epic failures such as epic movie as well as the vile and downright hateful Norbit."

        "review_detailed_main": "Another Marvel comic book story reincarnated on the silver screen, Ghost Rider is a story of redemption, good vs. evil and the other complexities common in this genre's lore.\n\nJohnny Blaze, a young motorcycle stunt driver does carnival acts together with his dad, whom he tries to save from certain death by accidentally entering a pact with the devil. He grows up doing increasingly more dangerous stunts while trying to redeem his ghastly self and protect the woman he loves.\n\nThe unbelievably handsome Matt Long plays the young Johnny Blaze, who unfortunately grows up to look like Nicolas Cage with hair plugs and seemingly fake abs (which Cage has reportedly defended as real and not CGI as suspected). At least the beautiful Raquel Alessi, who plays Johnny Blaze's love interest Roxanne Simpson, grows up to be the equally luscious Eva Mendes. Peter Fonda plays the devil Mephistopheles, and Wes Bentley (from American Beauty) plays his son, Blackheart, who calls on the other forces of evil to help wrest from the Ghost Rider a prized contract.\n\nCGI-effects were heavily used, which is why the movie was about a year late in its release, so I might as well comment on it. When Blackheart transforms into his evil face, he laughably looks like one of those ghosts in Asian horror flicks like The Grudge or The Ring. Blackheart's minions were also not worthy adversaries, very easily defeated by Ghost Rider in the incredible situations, which is perhaps why the children in the theater were not scared.\n\nGhost Rider is fun stuff, nothing so amazing but it is definitely entertaining."

His sometimes childish behavior and obviously enhanced eyes keep the viewer on the edge of the seat. Sometimes laughing, others gasping, always entertained.\n\nMendes delivers again as a beautiful woman who can show insecurity and doubt better than any other actress out there. She captivates with sexy looks and her stunning figure, yet shows us that she can portray a woman not totally full of herself for having those qualities.\n\nFonda's performance as the devil is sometimes wooden, but exactly what the character needs to portray a sense of subdued danger and menace.\n\nOverall, Ghost Rider is what is supposed to be. Fun, exciting, sometimes comical.\n\nCome on, It's a comic book. See it to laugh, see it to cheer. But GO SEE IT!!!"

However, Ghost Rider is still an enjoyable film, and certainly represents an improvement over Daredevil, Johnson's last Marvel outing. Cage is the star attraction, and his turn as Johnny Blaze strikes the right notes of comedy and confused sincerity, whilst Eva Mendes and Sam Elliott both give able support (and special mention to Mendes' breasts which virtually deserve a mention of their own on the cast list!) and, crucially, the look of the Rider has been nailed \u0096 an interesting mix of Blaze and Ketch, for those who know what that means. The big problem here is when they bring on the bad guys \u0096 all of whom are just a bit feeble, and are disposed of by GR with less fuss than swatting a fly. This lack of menace undermines the whole movie, as you never get a knock-down, drag-out scrap that you need to root for Ghostie in. Which is a shame, as with a tougher villain, this could have been a top film and, as it stands, it is just an enjoyable movie."

I think the major flaws in this film, were the jackass they got to write the script, and the awful director whom I personally hope in the near future kills himself so that he can no longer ruin any more comic to movie projects. It starts out decent, rides through up until Johnny Blaze FINALLY becomes the Ghost Rider. Then things take a turn for worst, the fight sequences were short and over all unimpressive, and the look of the demons and all that were totally corny (of course no where near as corny as some of the dialogue). It all builds up to a horribly clich\u00e9 showdown, and a chick flick ending just for a twist. Do yourself a favor, don't go in with high expectations, this movie is sub-average."

For one thing it is comic-book based and people should not expect it to be full of profound acting. However I was only actually impressed by Sam Elliot as Caretaker. Nicolas Cage was next, he did as good a job as he could under the constraints of the direction and script. Peter Fonda was impressive due to camera angles, shots and props, rather than really being allowed to shine through his own effort. Eva Mendes was just OK but there was no real chemistry between her and Cage; guys will enjoy looking at her ever-present cleavage. Wes Bentley as Blackheart, son of Mephistopheles, was totally unconvincing and as a villain utterly unimpressive. The NY Post, which rarely gets anything right, accurately described his look as \"rockabilly Eddie Munster\". His henchmen, the Hidden, were equally without any gravity as villains, leaving a real hole where a nice hateable villain should be (except for Fonda/Mephistopheles).\n\nOn the positive side, the action and effects kept me glued to the screen for more; speaking as a long time GR fan, the way they did his transformation, his flame cycle (even the sound) and his action scenes were very cool and satisfying! At least 4 times during the movie the audience in my theater broke out into applause, all during great special effect or action scenes, such as the first time Johnny Blaze turns into Ghost Rider.\n\nI did laugh out loud at several (intentionally) funny moments; but this movie was all over the map and not consistent in what balance of action, horror, camp and comic relief to aim for. There wasn't enough horror or tension to call for that much comic relief.\n\nThis movie is worth seeing on the big screen for the spectacle; it is fun and I am glad I saw it. I think Nic Cage and Sam Elliot were the right choices for their characters. However I was disappointed in the villains and supporting characters for the most part and they were bad enough to distract me even during the \"comic book movie\" I had anticipated."

The first half of this movie was rather engaging until Blackheart shows up and points to the rest being a special effects fest. That's usually a sign that the story is going to get weak and it did. Nicolas Cage (Johnny) was reasonably cast for the role of Ghost Rider. That's a guy who makes a deal with Mephistopheles (the Devil's right hand in some myths) to save his dad but the deal turns out to be sour. Now he's forced to work for Mephy and his main task is to kill Blackheart, who happens to be Mephy's son. Eva Mendes - usually playing the role of a tough girl - is oddly cast as Johnny's love interest whose only role in the film seems to be to kiss him and show us her ample bosom at every (yes, every) opportunity.\n\nDonal Logue (of Grounded for Life fame) plays Johnny's buddy but his character is poorly developed, like most in the film with the exception of Johnny's, of course. In Ghost Rider mode, \"bonehead\" Johnny looks a little bit too CG. So do some of the other evil spirits who have sharp teeth appearing on the face every now and then for some reason. Like Venom in Spider-man 3, are repeated showings of teeth (coupled with a high-pitched, fast, shrieking sound) supposed to scare us? It would seem the movie was simply not aiming for a slightly mature audience. Overall, it's generally entertaining but has little depth and falls short of full movie-going satisfaction."

But, at the same time, it wasn't as close to the comics as it should have been. Now, it doesn't bother me when people depart a little bit from the comics. But, come on, they messed this up so bad. It seemed like Johnny Blaze was turning into the Ghost Rider whenever he felt like it. That's not how it goes in the comic book. If he's around evil, he'll turn and it doesn't matter who's around. Second of all, unless the demons possess a body they don't look like people. Yet, in this movie, they do. They changed the character design of the villains TOO MUCH! Also, the Ghost Rider is capable of carrying out conversations. But in the movie, he can only say a few words at a time, most of the time those words being some one-liner which HE ISN'T SUPPOSED TO SAY! Don't even get me started on Roxanne Simpson. The only reason I tolerate this movie more than \"Daredevil\" is because I'm just not that big of a fan of that character (or of Ben Affleck, for that matter). The acting was mostly bad, although I did like Nic Cage, the fight scenes weren't great, as was also the case in \"Daredevil\", but the special effects were pretty cool.

        "review_detailed_main": "If it weren't for this movie, I wouldn't know the Ghost Rider character, who is perhaps one of the darkest and most little-known characters in the Marvel universe. I'm not a comic expert, I just know some characters (the most famous ones) and I've seen some movies. So I'm going to ignore the source material and focus on what this film brings us, assuming I'm not the best person to say if this is a good adaptation or not.\n\nThe script has some notes of interest, especially for those who appreciate a more adult and denser universe: Johnny Blaze was a young acrobat who performed impressive circus acts with motorcycles, along with his father. However, upon learning that his father is about to die of cancer, Blaze decides to accept a pact with the Devil in hopes of saving him, which he is unable to do. Forever bound by the pact made, he becomes a monster that seeks out and punishes violent and cruel men... until the day he has to recover a contract of hundreds of souls that would doom an entire village, which would give whoever had it enormous evil power.\n\nIf we consider the film as a piece of entertainment, I think we'll leave reasonably satisfied. The film is not an example of art, and I don't think anyone involved will miss it very much, except perhaps Nicolas Cage, for whom the film was a good financial bet, despite not being particularly successful with the critics, and have been heavily criticized by the public. Directed and written by Mark Steven Johnson, it's a film with less action than many would expect, although I didn't have any problem with that. I found it more difficult to deal with the uneven pacing of the film, which wastes time in certain scenes in a way that is difficult to justify.\n\nDespite being undoubtedly popular and charismatic, Nicolas Cage is not at his best here and gives us an interpretation that is, to say the least, unsatisfactory. However, Cage has revealed over time that he is not a steady, balanced actor either. He's very good, he's capable of doing great work, but he can also be disappointing. Peter Fonda is quite good here, but his participation is relatively paltry, appearing only in a few scenes. I have doubts about Eva Mendes' talent for acting, I still haven't seen her play a character that doesn't depend on her sex appeal, and what I saw here didn't convince me. However, what she did is enough for the character, who is just a hot girlfriend. Sam Elliot does well and gives his character an old-time \"rough tough\" scent, which I liked.\n\nThe film consistently and intelligently bets on strong and impactful special effects and quality CGI. Obviously, not everything works well and those fire effects, on the character's face and motorcycle, are so obviously fake that they don't convince anyone, even though the result is aesthetically beautiful and matches the character and the environment. After all, burning skulls are still a classic of tattoos and prints for biker jackets. The film makes good use of the chosen filming locations, it has good sets, good costumes, a dark environment that is not overly dense and does not frighten. Anyone who considers this film a horror should avoid films like \"The Exorcist\" and others, so as not to end up dying of a heart attack, because this film, as it stands, does not scare a fifteen-year-old teenager."

        "review_title": "It's a bit of a bumpy ride, but still a reasonably enjoyable one",
        "review_detailed_main": "It's hard to enter this movie with an entirely open mind. Nicolas Cage has had his ups and downs over the years; comic book movies have had their ups and downs over the years; computer-generated imagery of the early to mid-2000s was kind of in that awkward teenage phase where it was boldly determined to be everywhere and do everything, but lacked the maturity to always succeed (and generally less so the more it tried). Zeroing in on Marvel flicks, in particular, before the unified Cinematic Universe was inaugurated - well, some hold up well, some were swell at the time but are weak in retrospect, and others had clear issues from the get-go. With all this in mind, in fairness to this 2007 feature and whatever else might be true of it, it's readily evident from the beginning that all involved were having a really good time making it. Just as much to the point, 'Ghost Rider' only wanted to entertain, and is that not what we want out of genre romps in the first place? I'm not saying that this is without its flaws, because it absolutely has flaws, but I'm a little pleased that it's actually somewhat better than I expected. Take that as you will.\n\nLet's get the bad news out of the way first, because there is a lot of it. I mentioned the dubious mid-aughties CGI, and for good reason: the more we see of it, the worse it looks. This is true throughout the length, but first really comes into play in the sequence that culminates in Ghost Rider first being visualized (replete with flaming skull), and becomes a more dominant factor thereafter; Mr. Rider's skull itself often looks either too big OR too small to belong on his shoulders. It takes almost 45 minutes for the fiery fellow himself to show up, which leaves just over one hour for the real plot. Before that we're treated to \"Johnny Baggage,\" intercut with scenes of \"Hell Guy and the Spooky Boys.\" All the while there's a fair bit of dialogue and scene writing that's outright terrible, made more so when the gauche vocal effects are employed; even as the scenes and narrative are built for fun, there's a considerable portion of filmmaker Mark Steven Johnson's screenplay - even some characterizations - that are too kitschy for their own good. Quality is sacrificed for cheap thrills or amusement, or moments that are intended purely to emptily mimic the Slick And Cool imagery of comic books; these account for nothing beyond their immediate dispensation, and rapidly grow tiresome. In fact, there's much of the title that should have been left in the pages of a comic book, or perhaps instead rendered in a fully animated film (preferably 2D). And while overall the cast ably adapt to the needs of the extravaganza, all eyes are on Cage here. He's enjoying himself, and there are times when he infuses some detectable earnestness into his performance; there are also times when he's in full \"The bees! Not the bees!\" mode, and one can only laugh at the preposterousness; in other instances (including the last few minutes) his acting is just sadly limp.\n\nOn the bright side, the story itself is fantastic, and no matter the medium it's primed to be a delightfully gnarly, horror-laden blast. There are some truly outstanding ideas scattered throughout these 110 minutes, both in the writing and in the visuals, and one simply wishes that the exact means by which they had been realized were more careful and judicious, or had shown more restraint. While the excess of digital wizardry is unfortunate, the designs thereof are appreciable, and some examples are better than others; tangible creations, meanwhile - sets, practical effects and stunts, costume design, hair, makeup - are all splendid. While no few moments are rather tawdry as they present, at large I like the cast, and from one to the next no one can say the actors aren't committed; Johnson's direction is likewise capable, if imperfect in overdoing various odds and ends. The use of popular songs on the soundtrack is a smidgen ham-handed; alternatively, though Christopher Young's score tends to be a tad overzealous, the least that can be said is that his music lends to the flavors on hand. 'Ghost Rider' is well made in broad terms, really, and anyway, maybe all this is slightly beside the point: even while peppered with tinges of horror and notes of a tragic backstory, more than not the overarching vibe is light and lively. I'm quite reminded of Sam Raimi's first two 'Spider-Man' flicks with Tobey Maguire, or maybe 2015's 'Ant-Man,' all of which leaned into the mirthful side of comic books; this earns some genuine laughs at a few points. Once again, everyone contributing here only wanted to give audiences a good time, and for better and for worse all elements are bent toward that goal.\n\nNo matter one's impetus for watching - or how generous one is inclined to be - it's surely a step too far to think of saying this is a \"great\" movie. It's just as easy to get stuck on the faults and weaknesses here as on the advantages and strengths, and to weigh one against the other, I'm unsure if there's a meaningful, quantifiable disparity. Specifically in recognition of the fun-loving ethos that defines it in all ways I think the picture is better than not, and it is enjoyable; exactly how enjoyable one finds it will depend on how powerful your inner child is. All told I think it turned out to be more worthwhile than I'd supposed, sights unseen, for the past sixteen years; I also doubt I'll ever find need to watch it again. Watch, by all means, and just soak in the overcharged reverie. Just sit with modest expectations, and maybe that's the best way to get the most out of 'Ghost Rider.'"

If this movie is gonna do well, the credit should go to the excellent visual effects team (brilliant scenes) and the one man on the screen who did manage to save it was Sam Elliot as Caretaker.....Eva Mendes and Cage = no chemistry....i think this movie is little better than the Punisher though.

So my friend and I sat together at the theater ready to mock it (quietly, of course), but we both ended up being totally engrossed in the movie.\n\nEven though I'm a huge Nic Cage fan, I thought \"motorcycles?\" and \"the devil's bounty hunter?\" - how dumb! I was surprised to find that it was actually a good story line and funny too! It had it's cheesy moments, but overall was pretty darn great. And there were lots of familiar faces like Sam Elliot, Peter Fonda, Donal Logue and Matt Long that had us saying, \"Hey - that's the guy from (fill in the blank)!\"\n\nI highly recommend seeing it."

Then when Ridiculous Cage was headlined as the hero himself, my intrigue turned to worry...\n\nUpon initial viewing, I was - honestly - a little disappointed. I find it hard to enjoy Cage (with Kick Ass being his finest hour to me), and felt that some silly moments made by the studios decisions, left this Marvel flick a bit flat.\n\nThen recently I found the extended edition at my local pound store and figured, for a pound, I could add that to my super hero collection (and put up with the extra running time).\n\nAnd I'm glad I did.\n\nKnowing what to expect now, I actually rally enjoyed it for a second (and third) time. My kids love it, and it is growing on me very quickly. Cage is - well, Cage. You can't change that! But he pulls of the role comfortably and has plenty of humour to work with which suits him best.\n\nGhost Rider suffered a lot of hatred upon release, but its not as bad as you think. Definitely worth the re-watch, and a great piece of super hero action cinema!"

BATMAN, SPIDERMAN, SUPERMAN, THE HULK, have all made it from the graphic childhood page to celluloid, and some of them have done it well. But Ghost Rider sputters and dies.\n\nThe most \"inflaming\" issue for me was Nicholas Cage (THE WICKER MAN). He's, what, 43 years old? And he's playing an Evel Knievel-esquire, motocyclying hotshot who jumps everything from cars to spinning helicopter blades? Puhleease! He's getting too old for these roles and it's showing. Someone younger and with a cockier attitude could've pulled of a much more believable Johnny Blaze (perhaps Heath Ledger?) The love interest of Roxanne Simpson played by the exotically pretty Eva Mendes was nice to look at, but stood out as a mere cardboard character delivering unbelievably clich\u00e9d lines. Other than showing off her constant cleavage, she didn't hold any acting power.\n\nPeter Fonda as Satan (aka Mephistopheles) was okay but he's seen so little that we don't really give a \"damn\" about him.\n\nThe over-the-top evilness of Satan's son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) was weak and his motives never fully explained (other than he wanted to have a \"Hell on Earth\" via a forbidden city that is likewise never explained at all).\n\nMy only soft spots for the film were the wickedly awesome bikes, the laughable (and appropriately so) Ghost Rider CGI moments, and Sam Elliott's intoxicating narrative. I've always enjoyed listening to Elliott's voice \u0097 it's syrupy smooth and deep baritone was a great dichotomy against an ancient tale turned modern.\n\nBut the film as a whole is exceptionally weak. The love story feels and looks forced (again, Cage is just too old for someone the likes \u0097 and looks \u0097 of Mendes), the character's interactions are whisked aside in favor of action that isn't explained, and those characters that are interesting are given so little screen time that we just don't care about the story at all.\n\nAside from the cool motorcycles and Sam Elliott's voice, this one should have you burning rubber back to your local video store in order to return it as soon as possible!"

I have never read the original comic books but if they are as bad as the movie I don't think I have missed too much. I even don't want to comment it but I think I must warn you. Now I have to write ten lines of text...\n\nFirst I will tell you something about the story. There is no such thing here. We have some pathetic excuse of a story which does not make any sense. Believe me, that is the truth. I knew it was not going to be some \"Oscar\" winning screenplay but... Even 'Batman and Robin' had much better story and screenplay.\n\nNow I will tell you something about the characters and the acting. It is quite obvious that the makers of the movie didn't know what is character development. They tried to make me care about Johnny Blaze but they failed miserably. And there are just no more characters. About the actors... Cage looks drunk all the time. How could an actor as talented as him act so bad is beyond my imagination. Eva Mendes acts terrible and even looks terrible in the movie. I seriously doubt she is that ugly. Well... At least Sam Eliot looks cool but his character is completely useless.\n\nAbout the action and the effects? The action sequences are just pathetic. I guess you have seen at least one of the new Steven Seagal movies. Well, the action in them is better than the action is 'Ghost Rider'. Much better. As for the effects... Have you seen the trailer? If you have you saw 90% of the visual effects. And the rest 10% are not worth seeing. And the effects in most of the sci-fi or fantasy movies in the past ten years are much better. Ghost Rider looks like he came out from an animated movie, not from a live action one. His bike is just ridiculous also. And demons... They are not even funny.\n\nSo what do we have. No story, no acting, no action, no visual effects. Nothing. 1/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Any fan of the comic book source material, or anyone having briefly heard of the character could easily recognize the cinematic potential for the Ghost Rider myth. How could the tale of a stunt motorcyclist, tricked into selling his soul to save the life of his estranged father and unwillingly becoming the devil's bounty hunter ever translate as something less than a dark epic thriller? Well, fairly easily, it would seem, if all parties involved seem determined to ignore the biting intensity of the subject matter and bring the story to screen as a watered down, painfully predictable tale devoid of any redeeming factors or cinematic merit whatsoever, as is unquestionably the case here. Fans of the comic Ghost Rider, be prepared - this is not the Johnny Blaze you knew and loved, this is nothing more than an inexcusable Hollywood massacre.\n\nWriter/director Mark Steven Johnson, who seemed to have such a firm grasp on all of the defining assets of his source material in Daredevil's dark tale of redemption seems to have thrown any sense he once possessed off the proverbial rooftop, as his abysmally weak screenplay is at best a confused, imbalanced muddle riddled with more clich\u00e9s than would seem humanly possible. The plot holes and flaws in logic are large enough to drive Ghost Rider's chopper through, and the protagonist's demonic abilities are never explained, to the point where new abilities seem to be invented on the spot, simply for the purpose of furthering the plot. (how to defeat the wind demon? By using his flame tornado ability of course! What do you mean he's never shown evidence of such a power before, he's had it all along... really!) The fact that Johnson's script could have been considered passable is really a testament to Hollywood's recent trend of tossing anything into theaters, no matter how weak or inconsistent, to make a quick buck.\n\nAnd while the film, being a comic book action movie, may not have required a Pulitzer prize winning script to be a success, even in the action sequences the film seems rushed, ill conceived, and frankly just plain lazy, generating no tension or excitement whatsoever. The CGI is absurdly bad, to say the least - Ghost Rider himself boasts worse animation than most 1990s video games, and Blaze's transformation into the rider, which in the comics was a haunting and painful spectacle to behold, in the film is excruciatingly poorly done and mildly humorous. It goes without saying that the characters' abilities make for some fairly brief and uneventful battle sequences - Blackheart pokes people with his finger, and they die, whereas Ghost Rider simply stares them in the face, and they collapse, (the anticlimax is astounding...) whereas Blackheart's elemental sidekicks have such terrifying powers as being able to blow hard and drag Ghost Rider into a puddle of water... oh dear. How this could have been interpreted as even potentially enthralling is more frightening than any of the characters could ever hope to become in such a hackneyed mess.\n\nDespite star Nicolas Cage's fervent admiration for the character, he is all wrong for the role right from the start - his performance, at times strangely goofy and otherwise painfully melodramatic, never comes close to capturing the dark intensity appropriate for Johnny Blaze. The normally talented Eva Mendes fumbles through her lines without a trace of emotion, her purpose in the film sadly reduced to cheap eye candy. An absurdly miscast Peter Fonda makes for a laughable devil figure, complete with a ridiculous beehive hairdo and far too many knowing references to Easy Rider to ever be taken seriously or come across as even slightly intimidating. Character actor Wes Bently at least appears to be trying as malevolent demon Blackheart, but he is saddled with most of the worst lines in the film (which is saying a lot) and the freedom to seemingly either overact or underact whimsically, making for yet another disappointingly ineffective antagonistic figure. Only Sam Elliot escapes with a trace of dignity as the mysterious Caretaker, but his oh so stereotypical \"wise, grizzled mentor\" role has frustratingly little purpose in the film, making his presence seem almost unnecessary. It is nothing less than a colossal disappointment to see such a talented cast reduced to a level of such frustrating mediocrity.\n\nIt is really quite as mystery as to how Ghost Rider could have misfired so severely in almost every possible front. As the film wavers uncertainly between being patronizingly predictable and absurdly nonsensical, butchering the comic book source material in the process, it still has the gall to take itself too seriously to even embrace the potential of being enjoyable in the \"so bad it's good\" sense. There is little good whatsoever in Ghost Rider, and apart from genuinely die-hard enthusiasts prepared to see the original character warped inexcusably or those in search of a thoroughly mindnumbing and unenthralling action romp, it would seem prudent to avoid the film at all costs, or succumb to a disappointment of (dare I say it?) hellish proportions.\n\n-3/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm gonna get this out of the way now. This is not a great Nic Cage (\"Adaptation\") performance of either crazy or quality varieties. It leans more towards crazy than quality but there are way better crazy performances from Cage out there. The main problem is that during most of the scenes where he is being a BAMF, he is also a cgi skeleton. That means no awesome Nic Cage facial expressions or visual acting choices.\n\nDuring the scenes where is just regular old Nic Cage he does seem to give a pretty weird at moments performance. Unfortunately, it lacks the deep seated feeling that some of his other characters have. He may laugh like a little kid when watching a TV show then switch on a dime when someone turns it off but he doesn't feel totally unhinged. More like he just has strange moments. For the most part the film still wants you to identify with him and see his acts as fantastic to be sure, but also relatable and understandable which to me is something I'm not really looking for in a Nic Cage performance.\n\nThe film itself is one long mess. The stakes are said to be high but don't seem to be fully realized. A danger which is supposed to be akin to Hell being established on earth feels about as thought through as a Halloween Horror House that was set up in a few hours. It doesn't seem scary or real at all.\n\nThe story structure, scene structure, and general plot just sort of happen. It doesn't feel as if any of the characters really have agency. Everything seems false or to be happening because 'movie.'\n\nA good example of this is the first time we see Nic Cage do a jump stunt. This sequence is a mess. First you have Cage's, sorry, Johnny Blaze's stunt coordinator telling him he thinks the stunt is too big. They have a fight about it. Then, right before the jump, Blaze's childhood sweetheart Roxanne (Eva Mendes, \"Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans\") surprises him with an impromptu interview (she grew up to be a reporter). He basically refuses to answer any of her questions about how he feels before the jump, opting instead to ask her about her life, then inform her that the jump would be taking place over top a bunch of army helicopters, which his stunt coordinator also doesn't know anything about. He then makes the jump then squeals tires off into the arena and onto the highway to catch up with Roxanne on the highway as she heads home, and stop traffic to ask her out.\n\nNone of this makes sense.\n\nHis stunt coordinator should be pumping him up for the jump. The last thing you need before a daredevil stunt is your best friend and business partner telling you that you can't do it.\n\nWhat's with the surprise interview? Actual reporters may surprise a \"person-on-the-street\" with an interview question but not the subject of a story. They would have set that up weeks ago and Blaze would never be surprised by it.\n\nHow can Blaze catch his coordinator off guard with Helicopters? It's an indoor arena. There is no way that his entire team would not know that there would be running helicopters in his stunt. They would have to be loaded in to the facility. The pilots would all have to be checked out. Insurance companies would chime in. It's plain ridiculous to believe that 5 minutes (literally) before the stunt he could change something so major.\n\nAfter making the jump he peels out and takes to the highway, presumably by way of the arena. How? Through all the locked doors, stairways, and escalators? That bike isn't street legal. And I guarantee the first person to look at it, after he crashed it and survived to make the jump would be a mechanic. Blaze wouldn't have even got to it. For all he knows it is 15 minutes from exploding.\n\nTo top the whole thing off, the reporter left the event and Blaze had to catch up with her. Why would she leave? The event where he either dies or breaks the world record jump length is on the line. She misses the chance for a victory lap interview or postmortem coverage with the team and fans if he comes up short and is pureed by helicopter blades.\n\nThe whole film is like this. Stuff just happens. It doesn't make sense. They don't try to make it make sense.\n\nIf you think that maybe the movie gets better when he is the Ghost Rider then think again. He just transforms into a flaming headed skeleton dressed in leather, wielding a chain, and riding a blown up version of a hotwheels chopper. Then CGI happens. Flames happen. He says something tough and stares into someone's soul till they collapse.\n\nThis is a movie about demons and a demon hunter. Where's the blood, guts, or temptation? The bad guy just makes people's faces change color till they die. Wes Bentley (\"The Four Feathers\") has never been accused of being scary and he definitely doesn't bring it to this role. You'd think casting Peter Fonda (\"Easy Rider\") as Mephistopholes would lend some gravitas but again, no. Totally miscast. Should have gone with someone like Tom Waits (\"The Dead Don't Die\") who could have pulled off the vibe it seemed like they were going for.\n\nThe real shame is that there are the bones of a good movie in here. I can easily imagine the movie that actually deserves to have Sam Elliot (\"The Big Lebowski\") play the mentor and crazy Nic Cage as a vengeance crazy mad man but I think you'd have to break from the source material and director Mark Steven Johnson (\"Daredevil\") to do it."

I think that the only bad thing about this movie was the acting for the last 10 minutes. But other than that, it was a great movie. There were great special effects, a really good story, and enough action to keep me entertained. I love this movie. I think that it is one of my five all-time favorite comic book movies of all time. In order, it is Batman Begins, X-men 3, Ghost Rider, Spider-man 2, and then Spider-man. Those are my five favorite comic book movies ever made. I give special effects a 10, acting a 9, action 10, and story/script 10. All in all, I loved this movie. One of my five favorite so far this year next to 300, Disturbia, Pirates 3, then Ghost Rider, and then Blades of Glory. I love this movie and I think that it is incredibly underrated and that all the critics are wrong. 10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Director Mark Steven Johnson (of \"Daredevil\" and \"Electra\" movies) and his screen-writers made this homage to a cult-70's Marvel book a real mess. If I could I'd ask the people involved : \"If you don't like a subject or a specific comic book (like our case) why go and make a movie about it?\" Yeah, it's the money, stupid. Except that,in the end, your lack of interest is going to be very obvious. With comic adaptations stealing the spotlight they could surely do better ...\n\nThis movie fails miserably even in the visual level were similar films usually excel, which is kind of surprising since even old Mark Steven Johnson hacks like \"Daredevil\" packed some eye-candy. It seems like instead of progressing with his career and evolving his techniques MSJ goes one step backwards at a time.\"Daredevil\" had some good moments (namely the first 15 minutes) \"Electra\" was worse and this hits rock bottom...\n\nYou could easily blame the original comic but that's not the case. Movies like the \"Blade\" trilogy (the first two parts actually) or even Sin City are based on similar books but are actually a lot better. I think that's mostly because directors like Guillermo del Torro (Blade II, Hellboy ) observing the weak and schematic scenarios, cover it all up with nice visuals and set a steady pace in their films, while MSJ works mechanically using as little imagination as possible.\n\nNickolas Cage, who seems to be picking his roles without any thought or care, also fails miserably here. He tries to fit in the role of the undead Avenger but lacks the charm and the guts of a powerful performance. He sports a melancholic expression that is out of place and can even provoke laughter and not compassion.Peter Fonda's participation as Mephistophelis could bring a lot of charm but in the end ridicules a man best remembered from the epic \"Easy Rider\".Eva Mendez is simply as wooden as it gets.\n\nSmall budget, bad effects and mediocre acting, make this movie hard to watch even for the die-hard marvel fan."

I went into this film KNOWING it was going to be a bit stupid, but I left my belief at the door, and prepared for some visual/action entertainment. I wasn't disappointed. The writing could have been much better, and I'm not talking about character issues, I'm talking about oddities. Ghost gets stabbed and as Johnny has to be stitched up? OK\u0085 Later Ghost gets shot, uhmm, a lot, hmm. There are a few others like that and that is just not good writing. Plot:5 Acting:7 Direction:6 F/X:8 Entertainment:8 = 6.8 , call it a 7."
