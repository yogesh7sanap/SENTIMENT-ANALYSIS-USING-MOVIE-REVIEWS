If you like the post- apocalyptic genre but you need one for a mature audience (e.g. The Road, Mad Max, City of the Blind, Soylent Green etc.) skip this one, if you are a youngster around 12 or something like that, well, you may try it.\n\nWhy John Cusack took a role in this flick is a mystery to me. Thanks to some semi-pro or almost pro looking technicals like effects and camera (tv-scale), I rate a 4, but this is imo no B-movie but a C- movie.\n\nRedundant."

Real rating of this movie is more like 4/10 at the MOST!\n\nOK acting by some...Bad for some others and of course 1 good actor.\n\nThe issue I have with the movie is that it is pointless, slow and predictable. I won't discuss bad graphics sfx as certainly the budget wasn't big.\n\nThe story could've had so much more to it. It just sad they decided to dumb-out the script and make it so plain. It is a very slow pace movie and not in a good way as I got bored 1/3 of the way and not sure how I got through the rest- I was really expecting it to pick up and it never did. The idea behind the movie is nice,but it was never developed at all.\n\nDo NOT believe the high rating (currently 8) as those are fake ratings. There are many sites that sell Anyone giving this more than 5 or 6 did not watch the movie at all. I'd say any reviews of 2-5 can be considered real."

In one scene our young heroes seem stiff and cold, in the next one they are massively overplaying emotions. Then they are stiff and cold again. Repeat. Although the main story line is OK, there are plenty of stupid lines, some of them repeated several times.\n\nI would recommend this movie for a rainy evening when you feel like watching a slow-tempo B-movie where everything except the script is actually a first class production."

Full admission, I love(d) mystery science theater 3000 and this movie would have been a perfect target for it- a worthy competitor to Santa Claus Conquers the Martians or Manos Hands of Fate. There were point in the movie where I found myself laughing hysterically at how many scenes/story lines/special effects had been lifted from other movies or video games. By my count there were at least a dozen - most notable being terminator (several of them), matrix, gladiator, hunger games, blade runner, mech warrior, battlestar galactica, transcendence, Independence Day.... I could go on for a while. Others have noted the plot holes and I agree with their assessment. With that said, this movie is the good type of bad. Don't watch it looking for a serious dystopian movie- seriously, the main character has bleached white teeth, a jersey shore tan and highlighted hair - his love interest has a cell phone (didn't society collapse 97 years ago?), perpetual lip gloss, and a bow and arrow (apparently to shoot robots)..and let's not mention the Cusakinator. Do watch if you are looking for something to make fun of for about 90 minutes. Positive points, no one disappeared after catching a football or being diagnosed with cancer! I also don't think this cost $6m to produce. If that makes no sense, please look up The Room."

Argenziano is pure B movie material, while Cusack puts in a mediocre performance trying to mimic a sadistic robot born from a megalomaniac human. He just appears bored and confused most of the time. Grubba's performance, although only lasting a few minutes, is by far the very best of the entire film, although Wacker is close behind her and the only person who worked hard throughout the run of the story. I'd expect big things from Wacker in the future. I don't even know what to say about Schaffner without chuckling. Dire? Bad? Uninspiring? Amateur? Hmmm...not really amateur, he's not as good as that. His constant 'wide eyed and droopy bottom lipped' expression reminded me of Taylor Swift and left me utterly cringing for him, and aghast that a director would let such a desultory performance be allowed past the cutting room floor. He almost ruins the film entirely although Wacker rescues it and turns it into an average film that's only ever worth watching once but for that once you don't feel as though you completely wasted your time."

But none of these key elements were left in this movie. Only shallow, stupid Third-rate B movie plot there, looks they made it in a hurry. And very boring!!

So I called my friend on the phone and he told me he did chat with someone who claimed to be a Swede online before, and leaked some of his book's plots to him. It was about may 2016. Then the so-called Swede disappeared. Never contacted him again. He was very frustrated to hear the news, also very disappointed with this movie.

If I could direct the main actors, Julian and Jeannine any career advice I would say \"don't give up your day jobs\" - please, for the love of mankind. Please! The plot is so hollow and incoherent that when some scenes start, I had to rub my eyes because I thought I had fallen asleep and woken up 5 minutes later. Alas, that was not case, it was just the plot that was bad. Singularity get's my vote for worst acting in the history of EVER: \"I'm not pretending\"...\"I do feel\". Honestly, I wish I would say that this was a B movie but actually there isn't a grade low enough to give this film. Maybe one day, we will look back at this move and laugh like we did with Sharknado or Teletubbies.....well, wishful thinking perhaps. Unlike some other reviewers on here, I actually hope that there is a sequel because it cannot get any worse than this. Even if the sequel were to show 90 minutes of night sky with David Attenborough singing Amazing Grace nonstop, it can still not get any worse than Singularity. IMDb - can you introduce negative ratings please? Oh, and BEWARE FAKE RATINGS ABOUND. IMDb - you need to sort this out soon or your business will disappear."

Julian Schaffner's performance was as plastic as it gets. He honestly looks like he has no clue what he is doing throughout the whole film. Jeannine Wacker was trying to go for the Hunger Games look, but ended up more like the Emo Games. There is a scene where she is sitting by the river, singing; uhhh, so terrible, I actually laughed out loud. If you are in the mood for a train-wreck, this is it. I made it through half the movie before I decided I had better things to do like help my neighbor unclog his toilet. BTW, this is supposed to take place 97 years after Kronos exterminates the majority of the human race. The houses are super clean and the two main actors have new clothes and look like they just left the day spa. The other human survivors are dirty, deformed and unnecessarily violent. So...so bad"

That people deserve films like \"Baywatch\" for the rest of their life. Before seeing it, you should consider that it is not a high budget film and the director is young; and I find the idea so good, so I can say the director is very talented; the actors have not a lot of experience (except of John Cusack), but they managed to act very well (ofc they're not Johnny Depp or Emma Stone, but still.). Anyway, The graphics are as good as a Transformers movie, maybe the lights are a little bit strange sometimes, but the work with the green screen is undoubtedly very very well made. I didn't expect something amazing, but the film left me stunned, I believe in the director and in the actors, they have a bright future.\n\nI want to give a 10/10 to support, the film himself, considering the whole world of cinema, could be easily a 7.5/10."

The acting was poor, the plot stupid, the plot-holes many, the dialogues embarrassing, the ending threatening with an even stupider sequel. A singularity is a future event beyond which one can not make any predictions. Most of the movie was perfectly predictable. The only reason why some of the turns where indeed not predictable, was because I could simply not anticipate the level of ruthless incompetence of the scriptwriter leaving tons of unanswered and unanswerable questions: Where does that cornfield come from? Why does that facility burn down? Why where there at all any trains 37 years after the event? Why should groups of (male) humans be hostile towards strangers, when there is no competition and they are no threat to each other, only possible help? How could humans survive underground even for days let alone decades, where there is no food and machines are better equipped to catch their prey? How could humans develop fantastic technologies within a few, what? years? months? weeks? when they barely have food to survive let alone factories, supply lines and indeed the knowledge of the necessary physics. And why would an unbiased machine think that humans killing humans is worse than ants killing ants, lions killing lions or trees suppressing other trees in the first place? And if this machine for some mindless reason must eradicate humans from this world, why not doing it fast, efficient and completely.

Well, that and a terrible script, awful directing and amateurish acting-- even from the seasoned veterans, who apparently have no other expressions than detached boredom (main villain), open-eyed goofy wonder (male lead), and disappointing dullness from veteran Carmen Argenziano. The only decent acting in the entire film is from female lead Jeannine Wacker... but the lines they gave her were just unbelievable.\n\nExamples of plot dis-continuity:\n\n* A Polaroid camera that still has a working battery, flash and film after decades of sitting on a shelf.\n\n* Julia plays a \"Hunger Games\"-esque female that carries a bulky crossbow as her weapon-of-choice. (In a world where she could have about any weapon she might find, this cumbersome contraption would be one of the least viable.) (Did she even use it in the film?)\n\n* Her almost-instant acceptance of the male character, who frankly just appears out of nowhere looking like a model from a teen magazine-- with no real questions as to 1) why he has no weapons or supplies 2) Where he came from 3) How he got there 4) And just accepting the very lame answers he gives to her limited questions.\n\n* An AI construct retaining a human body (badly damaged at that). Nice \"head glow\" effect... just rather unbelievable.\n\nThe list goes on. As science fiction goes, this has very little science and a whole heap of fiction. Add to this long stretches of unnecessary scenes and trite dialog that can only be described as tedious and we have a predictably ludicrous and nonsensical ending to top off 90 minutes of uninteresting schlock.\n\nThe CGI is decent; the robots are believably awesome (if now clich\u00e9, having appeared in this form in many films. What are these, rent-a-bot models from a 3-D program?).\n\nBut the film just drags. By the time you're into the 40 minute point you'll be wondering if you should play solitaire on your cell phone to fill in the dull periods while you wait for the movie to get around to the end.\n\nThis is a bad film. Rather than watching this, re-wash clean dishes. You'll accomplish more with your time."

It also starts with the applied use of a supercomputer to control human beings. But as we know the machines always rise above the humans it is also not an exception.\n\nAlthough many audience find boring to see these type of robotics Sci-Fi as they all share a more or less common idea. The first part of that belongs to the Machines and their domination and the second part reflects the fight back of man. This Sci-fi also goes in the same orbit.\n\nBut some things are different here. It is more concern with human bondage and it lacks of heavy machinery apparatus that frequently unloads the movie. It has made a good combination of action and slow rising tensions between computer and the survivors of human being..So you will not find the movie as only a sci-fi rather it is a mixture of drama, romance and hardwares and softwares also.\n\nThose who like to see Robotics Sci-fi will enjoy it surely. The Terminator series..Ex machina..Blade runner..Robo cop...Cyborg..is these are liked by you then you are the candidate for this movie...Rest of all i am not sure."

The actors, all of them, including but not limited to Cusak look like a bunch of high-school drama group newbies trying to improvise their 1st act.\n\nThe \"special effects\" are really very special, someone probably dusted off an Atari ST just to prove it could be used for SFX in 2017. I will most certainly remember the names Robert Kouba (director) and Sebastian Cepeda (story) and avoid any of their future cinematographic creations like the plague. I recommend you do the same.\n\nHonestly, I am just missing the words how bad this movie is. As a high school movie project this would get an E - best case. This is my 1st review on IMDb ever and I can recommend this movie to serve as one purpose only: torture."

Most people in this movie did a lousy job, especially the director, screenwriters, actors, special effects team, even make up artists. But the saddest thing about this \"movie\" was seeing a good actor who clearly doesn't want to be there. You almost can hear his thoughts while he's \"acting\": \"What have I done?\" \"Why did I agree to this?\". Finally, it's a very low move to save money that could be spent on the movie, just to buy fake IMDb ratings. Besides being illegal, maybe the quality would have been a bit better, like two stars instead of one. This is only suitable for one of those marathons with friends of the worst movies ever made, to laugh at it."

Another 97 years later, Andrew Davis is unarmed and running from a killer robot in a deserted town. Calia uses her last electromagnetic bomb to save him.\n\nJohn Cusack looks tired and old. Of course, we can't be young forever. He's a minor character anyways. He probably spent a day on that set to collect the cheque. Other than Cusack and Carmen Argenziano, these are amateur actors doing most of the heavy lifting. The special effect also looks amateurish with student level work CG. Action often happens with the characters staring in awe at the CG in the distant. Most disappointing is the lack of set design. It's 100 years into the apocalyptic future and the world isn't overgrown. The places look abandoned but only for a few months at most. I don't know anything about the production. The budget is probably too low to make this look good. There are also bad story elements. Calia should have figured something is wrong with Andrew right from the start. It's so obvious that I was waiting for that precise twist to happen. There are countless other problems. This is only a lower grade B-movie."

Also some bad cuts here and there,for example,1 photo fell to the floor in one scene,the next cut the photo was in the sofa,magic! NOT! Would not recommend it at all, just waste of time!"

The execution is superb and the story is unique (even though the concept is familiar). I love the conflict between the boy and the girl and was hooked from the very beginning! (keep in mind I just wanted to watch and laugh for a few minutes at cheap cgi but ended up watching the whole thing because I was just so drawn into the story).\n\nThe concept feels like something you might've seen before but the film offers so much more than just good looking visuals. It's a story about our own humanity and brings up a very poetic question \u0084Can an artificial intelligence feel love?\".\n\nI don't know where this movie came from and I initially thought it would be complete rubbish but I ended up really enjoying it.

        "review_detailed_main": "Around 2020, Elias Van Dorne (John Cusack) has a company that produces military grade robots created by a super computer called Kronos for the purpose of ending all wars. His ultimate goal is for these robots to kill all humans because Elias has decided humans are the cancer that cause all the problems in the world. And this is done and world-wide wars break out all over and humans are killed off. Elias is obsessed with Arora - the last human strong- hold - but he doesn't know where it is, and he sees one human still alive and her name is Calia (Jeannine Wacker) and her purpose is to go to Arora. Elias makes a human machine called Andrew to befriend Calia so she will trust Andrew and take him with her to Arora. Then Elias will destroy it.\n\nElias and his brother Damien (Carmen Argenziano) somehow encase themselves within Kronos and are able to live forever. (How is that possible?) Don't ask, it's complicated. Now 97-years later Elias watches Andrew and Calia travel to Arora. Along the way we see other humans but Elias has no interest in them, but only in Calia and her drive to find Arora.\n\nWell, this is certainly upsetting. Is this the end game for all of us? Debate among yourselves.\n\nWhat will Calia do when she learns that Andrew is a human machine? Remember, we were told earlier that even Andrew doesn't know.\n\nThe only thing I have an issue with is the year that began all this and it should have been started much later than 2020 mostly because of the technology involved. See? (More complications?) Yes.\n\nOkay, more issues: If all humans have been killed off, where did Calia get what looked like new clothes? The buildings still standing looked well kept for the most part. ( Hey, remember that in a dream or now in a Sci-Fi movie anything is possible. Stop being so picky.)\n\nI cannot go any further without giving all away (There's more?) Yes, a lot more. A really big twist will happen and it surprised all of us. Stop it. You will never guess what it is. (Bummer)\n\nThis is a very strange, creative, upsetting and can this really happen in time story? Again, debate among yourselves. (7/10)\n\nViolence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."

It feels less like a movie and more like someone poorly edited together clich\u00e9 snippets of dialogue from the most trite moments of similar movies. The soundtrack kept me on edge like Comcast customer service hold music. The pallid lighting together with John Cusack's makeup and cosmetic surgery do make him look fittingly non-human, but I think that was only coincidental. Julian Schaffner's performance will make you wonder what casting agent thought he was attractive enough to sleep his way into a role. On the other hand, the with other leading character, it is hard to tell if Jeannine Wacker's performance was consumingly terrible or just poor and struggling against vomit inducing directing and script writing. \"And...surprised look: \"Were you awake just then!?\" ...cut\" The CGI was surprisingly palatable, to those artists; i'm sorry you had to work on this film. I'm even more sorry if you had to attend the premiere only to see your pretty decent work be mixed in with the rest of this cinematic excrement. To give you perspective; I have written and posted my only review ever here since there were none on RT just to save others from being tricked by a popular actor's name into thinking this is a watchable movie. If you like the Walking Dead or War of the Worlds but wished they were more like After Earth and a bucket of poop written by a lazy AI program that strings together movie clich\u00e9s with poor scene cuts; then you will love this film. I can't wait for a decent movie with an actual focus on the singularity to come along so that this movie can be differentiated as 'Singularity (2017, poop)'. The only redeemable part of the movie is the end when you see that they are setting it up for a sequel, which will give you a good laugh because someone could have actually watched the finished product and still thought a sequel could possibly ever be funded or made."

        "review_detailed_main": "What is it with John Cusack , he has gone from superb movies to taking any old part that comes along - He has gone down the what i call the Ron Perlman and Lance Henriksen road - ie Brilliant actors who have either gotten too old or just decided to take the money and run and its really quite sad to see such giants of the silver screen reduced to taking turdula like this on. I have to disagree with the one reviewer who has said 2012 and Cell were terrible - they weren't that bad - Cell started well but kinda lost its way and 2012 was a superb film i thought!\n\nI don't know but Mr Cusack seems to have had so many face lifts he actually looks like a woman now as well and he seems to permanently be black boot polishing his hair to keep it from grey. Obviously not growing old gracefully - he actually looks like a bit of a freak now.\n\nThe movie itself; well I was really looking forward to the first full Robert Kouba movie after the most excellent short \"THE RIFT\" and unfortunately we have been sadly let down.\n\nIts as though they spent the budget on the first 20 minutes as it started so well but like so many other movies it just lost its way and the effects became cheap and nasty looking. The story itself started well and then went completely to hell at the end - if anyone has a clue as to how humans or aliens or whatever existed and how the golden city skyscrapers of Aurora was created let me know as it just leaves the viewer saying \"whaaaaat\" at the end - its plain and obvious that they were deluded enough to think at the end that the movie was going to be a hit so left us with the remnants of possibility of a second movie to explain just what the heck the end was all about.\n\nIt was also sad to see so many parts ripped from other movies - my brother immediately pointed out the skulls in the water reminiscent of the original terminator and they actually used the same voice-over telling the tale of the machines destroying humanity almost word for word from the original terminator.\n\nNow here is what gets me - the main actor Julian Schaffner was absolutely the worst i have ever seen , in fact its an insult to call him an actor and quite sad when there are so many other talented young actors out there who could have brought something to this movie - no emotion it was as if he was reading off a card or like many actors like Jonny Depp and Gerard Butler to mention two who have a microphone in their ear and the script read to them - the difference is that Johnny Depp is a superb actor and this guy hadn't even had a full movie under his belt - it also transpires that he co-produced it so presumably mummy and daddy in Switzerland paid for his first movie Jolly - To be fair the female lead was not bad and you could see her trying so hard to battle with the script and awful actor she was with I just felt so sorry for her!\n\nSad also to see Stargate SG-1's brilliant Carmen Argenziano waste his time on this as well. I wouldn't waste your time on this as the whole thing is like some student movie written on the back of a cigarette packet and not a very good one at that. I think that if Robert Kouba had more money and a much better script he would have made a memorable movie; going by his past short films - such a shame for him that his first major movie outing would be so lame.\n\nOne point I would like to agree with one of the reviewers - there aren't many films that are worth a 1 rating (except maybe the exceptionally arty farty Keanu Reeves BAD BATCH lol) so I think most of the 1 ratings are a bit unfair - the start of the film was good and I think they possibly did the best they could with the budget - what cannot be forgiven is giving a non- entity like Schaffner who clearly cannot act the chance so star in this and that is what is unforgivable and worth a 1 - overall its a 4/10 for me. To me 5 is average and 4 is less than average. This is a lot better than some of the movies masquerading as Scifi out there - not many but a few and Robert Kouba does try and do a good job with a smal amount of money - I think the brilliant THE RIFT was made with just $20,000 which always impressed me so in all fairness its not decent to give this a 1 out of 10 that is unfair.\n\nWhat is also unfair are these Chinese and Pakistani review shills - you can actually buy reviews so i have found over on a site called fiverr - its so obvious who these are and why IMDb cannot filter them out is beyond me - let me give an example - reviewer who have been members for a few days and only posted 1 review and its a 10/10 - On here Davelenox from Lugano in Switzerland i presume is Schaffners mum or dad or how about the 1 review 1 days member samuel-93041 who gives it 8/10 - cmon IMDb weed these guys out - no profile - no picture 1 review its not that hard. Although sites like fiverr are now getting genuine members to give good reviews with of course the monetary incentive so i guess its getting harder to weed out the shill reviewers."

        "review_detailed_main": "Oh John Cusack, what in the hell happened to your career? The fact that Cusack, who has starred in so many movies that I cherish from my childhood, is in this is the scariest thing about this movie. *sigh* Oh well.\n\nSo briefly, this your standard \"computer achieves self-awareness and immediately decides to kill all humans\" cliche. Like Skynet in Terminator but so, so much worse. Every writing, acting and directing choice in this movie is a complete head scratcher.\n\nCusack plays his role without an ounce of emotion or nuance. They might have literally filmed his scenes by FaceTiming with him and having him just read the script over the phone. But he's hardly alone when it comes to horrible acting in this movie; all of the performances are completely uninspired.\n\nMy working theory is that the movie studio actually built an AI and tasked it with writing, directing and editing the movie..It then scanned every television movie of the week from the mid eighties to the late nineties about rogue AIs and decided to approximate the ideas from those films for this one.\n\nThere are tons of plot holes, of course, because the AI didn't really understand what \"humans\" were and guessed that they were kind of like voice emulators that occasionally moved and turned off if hit with CGI bullets. So it got confused and decided that Skynet could turn off 8 billion humans everywhere on the planet overnight, but that the other humans could just escape that...somehow.\n\nIt's explained what happened but not how in gods name it makes a shred of sense. I don't want to spoil it for you, but it's pretty banana-bread bonkers. Unless, as I said, you view the plot thru the \"eyes\" of an AI that doesn't quite get what humans are.\n\nI think the AI also struggled with the notion of the \"real world\", because one hundred years later lawns and buildings are pretty much just the same as they used to be, suggesting that the AI doesn't quite grasp the concept of growth and time. Although I suppose maybe Skynet was sending maintenance crews around to mow lawns and fix roofs and windows and stuff, which was pretty nice of it if you think about it. Gotta keep those property values up.\n\nSo in summary the AI made the humans move around a little and say things, mostly dialogue from other movies I'm guessing, and would occasionally turn them off with CGI bullets and explosions until there were only a few left. Then some other stuff happened, I think.\n\nOr something like that. I don't know, I stopped watching around 25 minutes, flipped ahead to see how it ended, then watched High Fidelity and felt very old and sad."

We can add that the plot is totally simplistic and the presentation is totally devoid of suspense and drama. The two young members of the cast were earnest enough and no doubt felt as if they were contributing to a watchable movie as they labored before the camera, but sadly their contribution was totally misplaced and seemed to belong in a different movie altogether. Movies like this one give you reason to be thankful for streaming. One can fast forward and learn almost immediately that this effort is not worth your effort. Imagine having to sit in a theater and being forced to learn this minute by minute."

        "review_detailed_main": "Apparently everyone else got to this one before I did. I figured if it showed up on Netflix and has John Cusack phoning it in, it must at least be worth a bit of dumb fun. I actually marginally enjoyed a similar kind of movie that appeared on Netflix starring Lee Pace as an American mercenary in an African country when an alien invasion happens.\n\nBut this one is just stupid. Flat out stupid. Even by the lowest of low-budget standards, this is stupid. This is 4th grade sci-fi stupid. This is too stupid even for that. It was so stupid I couldn't get more than 20 minutes into it.\n\nFirstly, the movie sets us up in 2019 where there are helpful robots everywhere from a corporation run by John Cusack's character, while he one night ominously decides to run Kronos, the first ever AI. to absolutely no surprise at all, Kronos awakens, and apparently decides, in it's dime store 5th grade sociology wisdom, that \"there's a problem with earth, and the problem is humans are bad and dumb and must be destroyed using nuclear weapons in order to save earth\" because we all know when you need to exterminate termites or cockroaches from your house, the best method is to take a sledgehammer and smash up all the walls and floors.\n\nnext, we're shown that John Cusack and his sidekick guy are actually AI beings themselves, in human guise, which kind of renders the whole Kronos gimmick pointless since they are already AI and have already made the decision to end all human life on earth, so why even bother making a show of this brand new first ever AI? Why even tell any of the humans?\n\nall of this is relayed in a numbingly monotonous exposition dump voice-over from an actor who turns out to be a complete ripoff of Katniss Everdeen from the hunger games when she arrives, and is unbelievably badly acted. Not even badly acted to a degree that it is fun to mock, but just boringly badly acted. she announces it is 97 years later and earth sucks now\n\nthe other element added in is some random teenaged boy in his mid-20s who somehow managed to survive the initial apocalypse and is now inexplicably wandering around 97 years later. But this is helpfully explained by John Cusack and his sidekick that this guy is secretly a robot like them, completely indistinguishable from human, who ALSO is unaware he's a robot!\n\nCaving in like a wet cardboard roof is; if this kid thinks he's human HOW HAS HE BEEN LIVING FOR 97+ YEARS WITHOUT AGING? On top of this stupidity, he gets attacked by a random robot and escapes, and the sidekick pointlessly asks John Cusack why he sent the robot to attack him, and John Cusack says so Katniss can trust him, implying that him being a human wandering around on his own post-apocalypse where robots kill all humans on sight isn't enough to get her interest.\n\nMAYBE she has experienced androids in human disguise at some point and so now can't trust all humans, but this was not mentioned in the minutes leading up to or coming after this, and at that point around 20 minutes in I just flat-out gave up on this stupid pile of stupid and ended it."

Over eager Writer/Director Robert Kouba clearly focused on the opening and conclusion, putting everything into the special effects and even a soundtrack by members of The Crystal Method. Suddenly with no money left, and little more than a student film reel in the can, Kouba roughly stitched together some nonsensical plot points with flat characters and even flatter acting to fill out the 93 minute runtime.\n\nThe ultimate tragedy is that it clearly sets up for a sequel, so it feels less like a complete film than a bloated trailer to some yet-to-come flick. I dare say that film isn't coming and I hope you already cashed that paycheck, John."

With too many references to other movies, there is hardly one original idea here.

The choice of cast is a bit off and John Cusack acting was a little off as well but I blame the Director and the script writers.

The acting wasn't all that bad, it just didn't really have an honest storyline but the concept is there! This movie probably needed a little more thought and time to it because I believe they rushed the movie so they can put it out there ASAP. The copycat twilight love story is the down part to this movie.\n\nI've seen worse movies with horrible actors and low budget qualities and tbh the main guy is kind of cute. The girl is kinda mediocre and John Cusack DID NOT fit that part so Maybe if they got an A-list actor to play either the girl or the guy or if they took a little more time with this movie, it probably would've helped this movie because it does have potential.\n\nOverall it's not a completely bad movie or the worst movie like some of these comments! 5.6/10."

However, as I am a big fan of Science Fiction movies, I thought I would give this film at least a chance. I must say that despite the trailer and some other comments here you will discover a very tender film about remaining good despite living on a destroyed world.\n\nThe young actors Andrew and Calia might not be at A level yet but their performance is good enough to let you feel the basic story of friendship and trust. Cusack and Argenziano play their role well and are a good contrast to the young actors. Overall I would recommend this movie to everybody who is interested in watching a film that is more than just special effects. This is definitely not another Terminator movie but more of a very fine Twilight Episode. My final rating: A+"

I was entertained and it left me wanting for more.\n\nThe film moves at a good pace, and the performances given by the main actors are believable and engaging. If you want to enjoy a good indie sci-fi you will find this a perfectly pleasant way to spend a couple of hours.\n\nThere was enough of action and intrigue to keep me focused for the duration of the film, and I was actually a little disappointed when the credits rolled. The actors, who to be fair are mostly a bunch of unknowns gave performances to be proud of, and you could feel the drama in the air, even when they would have undoubtedly been acting against the backdrop of the good old green screen.\n\nWould I recommend this film to a friend? Well provided they enjoy movies in the sci-fi arena I certainly would suggest it as a great way to spend an evening. While it is far from Oscar-winning, Singularity is an enjoyable fun romp into a broken world."

I am by no means an expert, but, I do have a little bit of an academic background, having taken some film studies courses in college (covering American film and European film). And I've been exposed to some highlight Bollywood movies, and highlight Asian films (mostly Korean and Japanese films, because I spent some time there.) So, I have a good, broad grasp or sense of knowledge of world cinema in general.\n\nFor the best of the worst in horror / fantasy, there are the American treasures 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' and 'Troll 2', and the South Korean 'Dragon Wars: D-War'. For drama, there is Tommy Wiseau's 'The Room'...\n\nThis movie is enjoyable in the same vein as these aforementioned gems. It is filled with confusing storytelling, inconsistencies, or at least not-so-believable situations or plot, pretty bad special effects, horrible dialogue, possibly intentionally bad acting, and just plain, blatantly ripped-off elements from other movies. And they pronounce 'Gliese' wrong; it is pronounced 'GLEE-zuh' or 'GLEE-suh'. ... I enjoyed writing my clever title for this review. I highly recommend taking an ambien tablet (or whatever your drug of choice may be) and watching this."

But my real question is why Netflix keep trying to tell me that I'd like garbage films. The Rift was the most ridiculous (you can see my review of that). It's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen and Netflix gave it a 97% for me.\n\nThis film just has a hackneyed plot, is poorly acted (except for John Cusack who is fine), and has really poor writing. You always know a story is going to suck when a voice over has to tell you what the story should be showing you.\n\nBut seriously, Netflix, your algorithm used to be fairly decent. Now I feel like its trying to make me watch garbage and convince me to like it."

The scenes with Cusak are improvised from the filming of a totally different film. The film box officed 4000 dollars. That should be a warning. It is PG 13 because it was rated by 3 year olds. Don't be fooled. The original Imbd rating was 2.0 but it got bumped to 4.6. This is because they bought reviews. Please do not get this film it is a wast of 50 cents that could be spent on cancer research not making movies that are cancerous. So please have Congress ban this movie and to John Cusak. Why? How could you be so desperate. The movie budget 100,000 dollars. You were played almost nothing. Why would waste your talent on this. Don't even get me started on the non existence of continuity.

It was either going to be a pretty good sci-fi story, or a cheesy romance, exploited many times in Sci- Fi, but rarely touched in romantic movies. Well, they failed to decide so it turned out to be half decent Sci-fi plus half decent romantic story. And we all know that having two halves of different bills is not the same as having a single hundred-dollar bill.\n\nThe story is not new, but still it could be a very pleasant sci-fi. It unfolded so quickly, that if we remove the romantic part, it could pass for a trailer. Music score was heavily influenced by Blade Runner, acting was pretty bad (Even John Cusack could not save it). Camera guy was still learning, CGI's were decent.\n\nThey tried creating a huge movie with a dramatic story, set between among the stars. But to create such big thing, you need a lot of money. Obviously they did not have them and now it looks like a low- budget version of Star Gate. If they tried creating a 7-8 series out of this script, it could have had a huge success."

Guy is clearly between Poltergeist -2001: A Space Odyssey and a Star wars. now the movie : 97 years old Polaroid battery works??97 years old wooden door work???and the worst - the WAtcher has a panoramic view all the time?? It seems like the movie was made between few beers ,some parts are good, and then there is a shocker,or maybe the bar got closed."

Now i can agree with other reviewers that complain about tons of 9-star ratings with no review.\n\nThe story was dull. Don't get me wrong. I like post-apocalyptic themes, and technology stuff. However, i want a least a vague sense of plausibility when tackling the theme.\n\nThis movie tries to go into Terminator territory. AI gone crazy, and deciding to exterminate humans. That's just the introduction, there is no explanation not development on that. You have to witness the AI kill humankind and then skip forward 97 years. (why not 100?).\n\nAnd then, the story revolves around 2 novice actors. Novice as in \"they can't act\". It is awful. I've seen best acting in street comedy. The \"old\" actors (Carmen Argenziano and John Cusack) and like they are not convinced. . I can pass that up. Then there is the FX. It is BAD. I don't require great FX for a good movie, but c'mon. At least try. Most current games look more realistic.\n\nBut then i return to the story. And that i cannot forgive. It is boring. The lines are tedious and repetitive. You could guess what was going to happen or was going to be said.\n\nI won't spoil the movie. But it keeps on going. It is boring, dull, and tiring. Other movies, with less money, unknown actors, had brilliant scripts, and kept me engaged. I feel this movie will bore you as it bored me, so PLEASE .... Skip it. You can go watch Terminator, and even if you don't really like it, you will be more entertain with the action."

There's an AI that controls the entire planet, but it can't track down an interstellar spaceship sitting on the surface of the planet? Somehow humans were able to construct interstellar ships without the AI knowing? Somehow they launched off the planet in the past, but the AI couldn't track them, or know where they left from? 100 years after the destruction after the vast majority of humans: The ones that still exist somehow still have power to light flashlights? Batteries in a Polaroid camera still hold a charge? Electronic devices that still function? Someone has brand new looking \u00d81\" rope? The AI can't track the remaining humans by their campfires? The AI doesn't have thermal imaging? Clothes are still \"normal\" looking? The bow and arrows, which serve no purpose in the plot line other than to insert a character that looks like Katniss Everdeen into the story, look like they were just purchased from Cabelas? Some unused buildings haven't been totally overgrown by nature and still look pristine on the inside even though windows are open for the past 100 years. People and their clothes are still \"clean\" with pearly white teeth?\n\nThis list is endless....\n\nI won't bother talking about the acting. Others have pretty much covered that. It suffices to say that it's terrible.\n\nStory sucks and just looks like it's trying to set up round 2.\n\nI blame Netflix for this recommendation."

Other actors, girl and boy, are like someone you can pick today on the street and then you drag him to studio. Girl maybe not so bad, bat that boy is like a stunt, atleast. Totally madness.

Let's do the easy stuff first.\n\nYes, CGI is often horrible. There's no matching the background lighting and colors. Sometimes I've seen a lot worse and from, for instance, SYFY.\n\nActing could have been better. Eileen Grubba isn't too bad as Andrew's mother. And, all likenesses to a certain Katniss Everdeen aside, Jeannine Wacker has potential. Julian Schaffner should, however, attend acting classes more often, though. Being kewt just isn't enough these days. Sorry, kiddo!\n\nSome (most) people complain about John Cusak's and Carmen Argenziano's acting (from bad to worse and WTF) and the fact that there's a city with bright lights on in skyscrapers. Some 97 years after Armageddon.\n\nHow 'bout this! Go back to about 4:40 into the movie and hear Kronos say \"I will feel you. Do not be afraid\" and ponder what that implies. If you still don't get it, fast forward to about 9:20 and watch Elias moving about. Still no response? Well, fast forward again to 36:13 and listen to what Calia says.\n\nCusak's and Argenziano's acting isn't half bad considering the above. It's like they have no real choice. Still don't get it? Repeat ad nauseum! But, hey, this isn't a movie with outstanding character portraits. It's Sci-Fi!\n\nYes, there are similarities to Terminator. Of course there are. And I'm not talking about possible dupes of robots. I mean, if an AI reaches singularity and takes over, what would you expect? Humans are, after all, something to be... dealt with. Perhaps Kronos did the right thing after all?\n\nAbout a year ago, on SciFi-movies.com, the movie \"Aurora\" popped up. A full length feature by Robert Kouba, a young Swiss short film maker. A bit of investigation gave that crowd funded \"Aurora\" had been canceled and, thusly, I wrote to Scifi-movies and had it removed. I thought Kouba would be out of the picture. Check out the trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcohH3YG4tM\n\nAs you can see from this trailer, it's \"Singularity\"! So, \"Aurora\" lived on and became \"Singularity\". Finally.\n\nHave I seen better movies? Of course I have! Have I seen worse? No doubt about that! So, I actually do rate this a 5 despite all the deficiencies.\n\nClear your mind and watch it!"

Roughing it in the wilderness with perfect hair, manscaped beards, clean and fashionable clothing in immaculate shape. With supplies running out, oh wait, where did that 1980's Polaroid instamatic camera come from? Why does its batteries work? Or why does it have film in it?!? Special effects I was okay with for a low budget flick. Acting was... passable for a low budget. The script however, oh God, the script. What a mess. They tried to have a twist ending, but it doesn't make sense with anything else. It's a crying shame that other movies are not green lit that stand the chance of being decent stories. This one should have been flushed."

What it feels like is a home project, for the two main leads or the director, as either university study, or just a hobby that grew into a full length film, so don't expect studio quality or the kind of continuity tracking or set design that would go along with this. There are other signs of unexpected growth with jerky plot motion, and filler dialogue by narration. All the scenes with Cusack appear to have been done over a single day shoot, in a darkened hotel room, and for the most part are repeated snap shots of him staring into space, later filled with graphics, done with a regrettable flatness; though it may be he's only done this as a favour.. Carmen feels more involved with the project. The plot and dialogue are a bit sketchy for them to work with though, think terminator universe, with hunger games mockingbird characters, and you won't be far off.\n\nHowever it's not all terrible, you can tell a lot of work has gone into it, and the graphic scenes could be very well done at times. The actors are young and inexperienced, but I thought the female lead at least kept it alive from an emotional stand point.\n\nIf you're looking for a punt.. just keep expectation low. I don't mind that I've seen it, and it may be just a long way round to getting the attention of a studio to make the second part fully, and although I don't get why it was released as a film rather than handed in at end of term, you may find odd moments it doesn't suck, like I did."

I'd love to be able to put some of the dialogue in and some observations but dear reader you would not believe. Watch it stoned is all I'll say, oh go on I'll give you one bit of dialogue, \"wild berries had no flavour anymore\"."

Honestly, the plot that the film tried to accomplish, and failed miserably, could be fascinating and I am hoping a movie can be made, in more skilled hands, although it wouldn't take much skill to make a film better than this. I do agree with reviewers who stated the positive ratings on this film were most certainly not genuine. No one with a modicum of intelligence and taste would find this film anything other than garbage."

I think some of the problem is that the movie is barely an hour an a half long, so it ends up feeling rushed; with all the wasted scenes of Cusack watching from afar, it ends up feeling like an over-long short film instead of a feature-length story.\n\nI guess there's a bit of a surprise/twist ending, but when you see it you'll just think \"Uh, OK.\"\n\nThere were also oddities in the writing that broke immersion.

Why not make your low budget film stand out with a more avant-garde score?

This one film has set us back at least 19 years. At least she is still hot and enjoys gaming.\n\nI can't explain how I was ever interested in this movie. The cast alone should have steered me clear of this pile of filthy entertainment poopoo. The special effects were surly done by a four year old running around with a parents cell phone.\n\nHow in the world this movie is rated higher than one star is proof of alien life and the Illuminati running a shadow movie industry bent on melting our minds.\n\nUsually during a terrible movie I am constantly waiting for something to happen that at least makes my wife and I discuss what we have spent two hours watching. Not this tome. She immediately walked out of the room and didn't talk to me for 36 hours. Which is probably a good thing considering all the name calling and swearing she unleashed on me AFTER she cooled off.\n\nPlease. Don't waste time watching this mess. It's not worth the time and will surely cause erectile disfunction and a drop of 30-40 IQ points.\n\nChances are high we could end crime and war with the simple threat of forced viewing of this film.

Almost no people for 100 yrs & she looks like everything just happened 3 days earlier. I've seen this before, a while ago, but I forgot what it was about.
