If it is first option, it is a profitable and enjoyable youtube content. But since this is a review on IMDb we shall consider it as a movie so it sucks. First thing to mention is cast which is full of famous or almost-famous 'youtubers'. Those guys or girls are not actresses or actors they should just continue to produce entertaining and enjoyable content for youtube. This situation that they have put themselves into is something like \"I can ride a bike well , so why not i ride a motorbike ?\". This is a logic that nobody should believe or follow. I won't even mention the actings of those i have been talking about. Maybe story can be somehow inspiring, but it can only inspire under 10 years old kids who can be inspired by almost anything at that age."

I rated \"1\" because 6 is too much for this movie and i think all of his fans rated 10 so this movie's average puan is so high for that movie. In addition, this movie's scene transition is so bad.. it is like a YouTube video or smth.. not professional and i think we can not categorize that like it is real movie. It has a lot of imperfect scene, casts (except 2-3 of them) was not acting very well. I don't suggest that movie unless you want to lose your times."

Actors are the worst part of the movie! They are so bad! And they are not even actors they are just youtubers! And this movie made a good box office so that means we are going to see more youtuber videos! Turkish cinema is death because if anything gets popular they make movies about that! This movie is a low budget movie! And when i went to theathers there were only kids like age 5 with parents and only kids were laughing to the movie!

Enes Batur has a unique follower mass, he has good communication with them and deals with an important crowd that no one else could strive to make a film, as most people cannot. I think critics like 'not hold a camera before' or 'not wrote a script' is absurd. When someone starts this job at the age of 19, when can they try? I think it's a good viewing rate for the first movie and the things he does in YouTube are very successful. It is wrong to approach a film in this way. Anyone with logic can see from the votes that everyone voted this film in the manner of having preconceived opinions and voted without a watch."

Inspired from Inception, it tells a story of a person who is stuck between the reality and imaginary world. Many philosophical questions arise and several ethical dilemmas are presented to viewers.\n\nThe film's cinematography is visually stunning, capturing the contrast between the vibrant, dreamlike sequences and the more grounded, stark reality. The transitions between these two worlds are seamless, keeping the audience engaged in the main character's internal struggle. Moreover, the soundtrack complements the narrative perfectly, adding emotional depth to key moments. While some may criticize the plot as overly ambitious, I believe it successfully challenges the viewer to think critically about the nature of truth and perception."
