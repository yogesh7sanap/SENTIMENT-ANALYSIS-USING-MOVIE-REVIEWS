Bad it was.\n\nThe very start states quickly what kind of thing will follow, the first shot is full of grade b cgi and even the opening titles were zero-budget style. We get introduced to a bunch of painfully clicheic characters (carried out by stiff acting) and plotline, surrounded by plasticky looking props and sets, effortless cinematography, boring color grading and so on and so forth. The special FX is mix of cheap cgi and practical fx that don't impress much. References to the contents of the games are there, a few, but to no satisfaction. So it continues for 90 minutes, from time to time entertaining us with emotionless and uninspiring action sequences. Oh, and the original score can be described the same way. There is some amount of much needed gore, but not creative enough or just simply not enough of it to compensate for anything. As the movie passes by, You find yourself predicting events and not caring for any of the characters - most you're going to feel is cringe or anger, if you're a \"Doom\" game franchise fan. You're also going to be very bored.\n\nI loved \"Doom 3\", have played it through for three times & if there's anything good \"Doom: Annihilation\" did is inspiring me to play one of the games again. I'm recommending a hard pass on this absolutely lame and disappointing game adaptation. My rating: 2/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I first heard that another DOOM movie was being worked on I was baffled; I assumed that after the terrible reception that the first film received, we would never see another attempt at making a DOOM movie (something that I was perfectly fine with, mind you). However, I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt; perhaps this time they would try to remain faithful to the source material and present us with a gloriously over the top action film reminiscent of the fantastic CGI trailer for DOOM (2016). After learning that it was going to be a direct to dvd film with a low budget, all my good will for the film dried up. The dreadful trailer and the absence of DOOMGUY failed to win back any enthusiasm.\n\nThe premise involves a group of UAC marines being dispatched to a station on the planet Phobos for security duty. On this station, a group of scientists, engineers, and researchers are experimenting with teleportation and, of course, everything goes horribly wrong. After having one of their scientists test out the teleporter and returning deformed, Dr. Betruger, the one overseeing the operation, decides that it would be a brilliant idea to send himself in next. This causes the station to experience a power surge and demons begin to invade. The marines arrive and must now attempt to bring the station back online and figure out what exactly happened here.\n\nThis sets up a rather dull film. A good portion of it is spent with the marines moving through brightly lit corridors halfheartedly pointing their guns at every corner and exchanging dreadful dialogue. None of the marines are interesting or memorable; they're all just a bunch of walking military cliches that we've seen countless times in other sci-fi horror films.\n\nThe dialogue consists mainly of cheesy action movie phrases and painfully awkward references to the games (example: a character refers to himself as an \"ultra nightmare\", which is a difficulty setting in the game series). For people that are unfamiliar with the source material, these constant references will have them scratching their heads and wondering why the dialogue is so unnatural. Fans of the games will find themselves rolling their eyes at these forced references.\n\nThe acting is stiff and lifeless, with the only exceptions being Dominic Mafham, who plays Dr Betruger, and Clayton Adams, who plays a marine named Winslow. Everyone else looks bored.\n\nI honestly couldn't tell what tone this movie was trying to go for. It fails to evoke any feelings of dread or horror because the entire station is lit up like a Christmas tree, and there isn't any proper ambiance. If it was trying to be a horror film, why not make it like DOOM 3? A game that features a dark and rich atmosphere filled with gory visuals and accompanied by some truly fantastic sound design that succeeds in immersing you into its world. Whatever. After meandering around for a about an hour, the film shifts gears and turns into a lame action movie.\n\nThe choreography for the action scenes is clumsy and disjointed, and I found myself dozing off during most of them. The outfits for the marines are unconvincing and cheap; they look like they are wearing airsoft gear. The CGI for the demons looks like something out of an amateur YouTube video.\n\nIf you're as big of a fan of the DOOM series as I am, do yourself a favor and skip this movie. You won't lose sleep over missing out on this. If you're not familiar with the series, this film will be a waste of time for you."

IMHO the actors played their parts convincingly and the action was okay. The only really bad thing about this were the CGI shots of the portals... that looked like from a 90s computer game. If you have some time to spare, give this a shot. There are far worse movies out there."

Whereas the film had more CGI that was high quality, better known actors and something of a script that resembled a film, it still was not as good as it could have been, actually deviating from the story of the game. HOWEVER, this newest take on the franchise actually stayed much truer to the very games themselves, allowing people to see the maze like corridors and sub sections that the players would normally have gone through in the classic installments of the Doom franchise. Though not the best idea to have a very slender young woman as the main character, she was still enjoyable to watch for the most part, and the movie progressed in a really cool way by the end that was much more satisfying than the film was. That being said, the film wasa teensy bit more badarse with all its flare. Nonetheless, I like Doom annihilation. 5.5/10"

So the cliche that developed was that games were where you fell in love with a game world, but movies were the vehicle that made the inhabitants and their lives \"real\".\n\nOver the years the gaming industry has made huge strides towards creating engaging and beautiful stories that integrate with gameplay, like Naughty Dog's 'The Last Of Us'. The movie industry, on the other hand, possibly because they more easily minimize language and cultural barriers, has increasingly found that movies with basic, uncomplicated plots can appeal to vast audiences in places like China. They have followed that trend by making films that are almost exclusively about the visuals, with almost non-existent plot and character development.\n\nThis movie is like seeing that original cliche come full circle. The plot of the latest Doom game, while admittedly pretty straight forward, it is an FPS after all, is at least as sophisticated as the plot of this movie, if not more so. And because this was a low budget film, the visuals are really awful, while with the settings maxed the Doom game looks pretty good. So here we are, with a movie that looks more like the cliche of a game than the game itself!\n\nNeedless to say, this movie is pure garbage; I would avoid it. If you want to watch a \"Doom\" movie, I'd suggest heading to YouTube instead and watching someone's 'movie' run (these typically just include the cut scenes and major events and clip out most of the combat, etc.) of the latest version of the game."

It was a waste of time, and if I had paid money to watch this I would have demanded a refund and lit my money on fire right there because it would have been more entertaining.\n\nIt's not even good for a laugh. It's not Dragonball Evolution levels of bad, but damn if they didn't try hard to compete with it."

This film really makes other video game adaptations movies like 2005 Doom feel like a masterpiece or even the Resident Evil movie series is well done. Doom Annihilation is a poor adaptation of the game. The script and direction is laughable bad and cheesy. The dialogue is horrible. The story is generic of the premise with nothing more to it. Besides scientists at UAC opened up a portal releasing the monster looking things from the game that throws fireballs at the people and infecting nearby scientists into zombie like things.\n\nThe plot is generic. Besides a rescue squad of soldiers going into the laboratory to discover that incident and trying to contain. The ending is even worse if it is trying to end for a sequel but it is cheesy.\n\nThe script is terrible with bad dialogue. The soldiers seemed more amateurs as a team than being professional. The direction is horrible with dull action sequences. And characters making stupid decisions. I really did miss the first person shooting sequence in 2005 Doom movie which was well done.\n\nThe acting is horrible with a cast of unknown actors. The visual effects are low budget terrible. The games animation seemed more realistic.\n\nOverall, Doom: Annihilation is one of the worst films ever. The action, direction, acting, and plot is just one of those bad adaptations of the game."

That movie changed the demons with people infected with some viruses. Now this Doom changed the epic DOOM GUY with a Doom woman and on top of that, not once does anyone in the entire movie refer to the demons as demons or to the portals as Hell. On the contrary, they are portrayed as some sort of aliens from another planet. Wow just wow.... had they respected the original story, despite the low budget, it could have been a better film with a higher rating and thus higher profits."

No stupid virus, no blue skinned neck biters.\n\nIf you want to add yet another overused zombie movie to the mountains of crappy existing zombie movies, just make a stinking zombie movie and don't fill DOOM fans with hope, only to piss them off.

It was made on a low budget but looks fantastic, it's good entertainment.\n\nI got good sci-fi movie vibes with this Doom: Annihilation, i saw hints of \"Aliens\" & \"Ghosts Of Mars\" & \"Resident Evil\" all Excellent films & \"Doom\" fits in nicely with this Awesome bunch!!!\n\nFirst off i have to say again how good this film looks for a lower budget straight to dvd B-movie flick, the production design is excellent!!! The music is very cool & the acting is mostly really good & the practical monster fx are Amazing, it's so nice to see rubber suit creatures on screen again, reminded me of old school 80's & 90's style & the Demon creatures are really cool looking!!! I know this is based on the old 90's computer game but i don't really know that, so i only go by this as a movie & as a sci-fi Horror Thriller it's great fun. The main positive thing about this film is it's Entertaining!!!\n\nOur tough Hero/Lead is \"Joan Dark\" played by Amy Manson who gives a moody & no-nonsense tough performance that's totally believable, she's Cool character & another standout Cool Character is the marine Captain \"Savage\" played by British actor James Weber Brown, he's a tough Shotgun wielding action hero while he's on screen!!! The rest of the cast of Marines & scientists are all pretty decent & solid on screen with lots of mixed accents that make the ensemble cast interesting.\n\nThis is a nice simple story about a group of scientists who discover an Alien teleportation device & open up the gateway that then unleashed Demonic creatures & a team of space Marines are sent to the strange moon type planet to check out what's happened, that's basically the plot but there's other bits & bobs going on but the main focus is seeing Cool marines fighting possessed scientists & Demon creatures that have taken over the space station base.\n\nThere's lots of Awesome action scenes & lots of old school gory blood splattered gore, like demonic people getting cut up with a chainsaw!!! & lots of Demons getting shot to bits & Marines getting ripped to pieces & throats ripped open, it's an Awesome old school blood bath!!! Of course there's alot of C.g.i stuff as the film goes on but it looks excellent for a limited budget film like this!!! There's a nice mix of practical rubber fx & the usual flashy c.g.i stuff but it all gels well together to look fantastic on screen. The moonbase station looks really good & the spaceships look Awesome, everything seems to be lovingly crafted to look the best it possibly can for the cost of what they had to create it all. Doom is a very enjoyable sci-fi Horror that's actually alot better than some of the huge budget blockbuster movies that hit the cinema!!! Also \"Doom\" has a nice pacing & an eerie isolated atmosphere. The marines look Cool as hell & the Demons are scary & ferocious beasts & some shoot fire balls!!!\n\nDoom: Annihilation is a fun & exciting action packed sci-fi Horror movie, it's also great late night entertainment."

And the 1st rule of a great movie high or low budget is story because story is always king! And this movies story is perfect, it follows the game lore completely and 100% accurately! And any reviewer that states this is another failed attempt at a game adaption doesnt know what there talking about because this is the best game adaption that ive seen that hasnt altered the story from the game just to produce some hollywood money farming polished crap! Anyone that dislikes this movie obviously isnt a fan of the games and has never completed any of the doom game franchise! If this movie had the budget and special effects of the 2005 release it would easily score a 20/10! The problem with the internet is everyone has a voice and thinks their opinions are worth something and everyone thinks their a brilliant critic which couldnt be further from the truth and completely reckless and damaging to film franchises career's and also ruins it for the people who truly enjoyed the film and want to see the next release! And as for the review about the ending being like it ran out of film is absolutely moronic because thats exactly how the games ended! Do yourself a favour ignore the negative reviews and watch this movie for what it is and no matter what your opinion is after keep it to yourself unless possitive! Recommended to every true doom fan and honestly are the only people that should and have the right to write a review of this movie is a true doom fan because thats the audience it is made for!"

It's just boiler plate dumb and dumber syfy horror with characters who get in their own way and by the end you're just hoping that they all die horribly. The one positive is that the production value and acting was pretty decent for this level of movie.\n\nOverall, two thumbs down and a middle finger for awftul writing! =("

Doom is using all the cliches as predictable as they may be.(I loved the easter eggs like each security card was blue, yellow or red) Who's going to live who's going to die? Yeah that's pretty easy to figure out in the first 10 minutes if you've ever seen a movie like this. It still manages to have some intense scenes and good action sequences.\n\nIt's low budget but I was hoping for more creatures, that's one of the best parts of the game, but they only use zombies and imps. I will give major props to the imp costumes, they were real and in camera and looked great versus anything cgi. The BFG was used and at first it was ok, near the end I was like hell yeah that's a BFG.\n\nIf you're a Doom fan like I am and also like low budget sci fi horror, Then I think you'll have you'll have a good time. but when it's over you'll wonder, wait if they didn't land then there was no problem at all?

If you don't know what B..F..G stands for, well, I've no help for you. (Hint: Big F... Gun) Back in the day, we all played Doom, using the Company's network to play against each other at lunchtime. Doom was ALWAYS great fun. Video games, like movies, come & go, but Doom set new standards for those of us who like shoot-em-ups. This film brought back fond memories for me. I like this version of film-Doom better, I think, than the last one with \"The Rock\". Try as I can to recall that version -- The Rock came off as just a bit corny for me.

If you can make a movie based on a video game with a $60 million dollar budget with an A-List actor (and former wrestler) and still have it be terrible, I doubt you can do worse with a low budget reboot. Because of that, don't expect gold as this flick has \"B-Movie\" written all over it. You see it with the no-name actors, the same redressed corridor sets for different scenes, cheesy dialogue indicative of the limited budget they were working with, and the CGI that was silly at best.\n\nIf you can get past that, you'll encounter a plot of space marines being routinely sent in for base security, only to discover a \"situation\" and investigate. They make no shortage of references to the Doom franchise which is nice but what I really enjoyed is the \"unexpected\". That is, you actually see these marines doing marine stuff (e.g. hand-to-hand fighting, etc.) and midway through the movie, you'll wonder why it appears the movie is about to end when it's just getting interesting.\n\nThey didn't shoehorn a strong female heroine in the name of feminism but instead had a nonchalant display similar to Sigourney Weaver in Aliens (1986) and Linda Hamilton in T2 (1991). The movie's look and feel isn't incessantly dark and terror-filled like the game and this movie takes place on the Martian moon Phobos instead of on Mars (like the game).\n\nI don't believe this flick was made to redeem the franchise from the cinematic disaster that was Doom (2005) but it's definitely an interesting re-imagined story. If you decide to pull the trigger, just turn your brain off and enjoy it."

This is a boring, soulless, pointless exercise in near-zero budget cinema.\n\nOk, granted, Doom is not the headiest game IP ever, but there is mysiticism, gory fun, body horror, straight-up hardcore knee-deep-in-bowels action and big stakes in the original game series. With such rich source material I am baffled how this lukewarm, middling, unoriginal and, above all, BORING adaptation ever came to be. Like, you have to consciously work on delivering such a bland screenplay.\n\nAll, and I literally mean, ALL dialog is recycled from far better movies. The leading lady's (Joan Dark -- is this meant to be a funny dig at Joan D'Arc? Seriously? Was this written by stoner college kids?) acting and delivery rivals an unpolished oak desk working for UPS. Is it possible to have negative chemistry with everyone? She certainly makes it possible.\n\nEveryone else is completely forgettable, apart from the big bad, whose... twist? is perfectly obvious from the minute he shows up after the shutdown. At least he puts in true, 100% all-natural ham when everyone else is clearly just baloney. He chews more scenery than the acid from the Alien.\n\nMusic, cinematography, VFX? Who cares. Soulless, but serviceable.\n\nIt's a bloody mess, literally and figuratively. And it clearly ends with the intention of a sequel. But why? Doom: Annihilation certainly succeeded in one aspect: it annihilated the IP for the movies."

Ultimately I expected something not top quality, and I was hoping that if it's not that good, at least it might be unintentionally funny due to how bad it might be, like the movie \"Airplane vs Volcano\". That movie was so bad in every way that it was actually enjoyable to watch while talking about everything that's bad about it. But that is not the case for Doom. It was semi enjoyable, but then it started to get stupid, but not stupid enough to just laugh at it. Just stupid enough to get a little frustrated with it and want to write a review about it. So bottom line, if you don't expect too much, you won't be too disappointed. Good enough to watch if you have absolutely nothing else to watch.\n\nSPOILER ALERT IN 3,2,1... Stop reading if you don't want to know.\n\n(Okay, resume countdown, 3,2,1...) When the female marine stared to fight off hords of the creatures by herself, even in hand to hand combat and annihilating them so easily, while the much bigger, stronger fellow marines just died so easily when attacked by only one creature, that's when the movie started to go downhill for me. Also, she was out of ammunition and began fighting in hand to hand combat. Then when the fighting was over you can see that she had several clips on her person that she could have used but didn't. Things like that started adding up and becoming annoying, but unfortunately not ridiculous enough to begin enjoying it for how bad it was or as a spoof."

The interactions and dialogue between characters we're lack luster added close to nothing for character development. It's clear the creators just wanted the main crew to be a bunch of bad asses but that fell flat as well. The costumes and cgi were not that bad, and neither was the set, this was probably my favorite thing about the film, I just really wish they would've done something more with all that. Honestly, this movie would have been so much better if it weren't so predictable; Like I said: every trope in the book. If you can get passed this though, then you should give it a watch, otherwise I guess it serves as mildly disturbing background noise, if you're into that sort of thing."

The story was really good, entertaining and true to the original games. The acting from the female lead and the antagonist were surprisingly good. The lead was strong, believable whilst the antagonist underplayed their character which suited the character.\n\nCGI was really impressive, again for the budget, and the creature effects were reminiscent of 90's creature effects like from the Guyver films - which are very nostalgic for me.\n\nIn summary, a really fun B-movie! If you like b-movies and Doom and don't have big studio expectations, this is a great 90mins. It's the kind of film where if I were a Hollywood exec, I'd watch this and think the film is amateur, however, the director, writer, lead, antagonist and CGI/creature effects team have great promise in the industry."

It feels just as cheap as the 2006 movie, but it has more gore and faith to the source material.\n\nOverall, I stayed entertained. I appreciated the faithfulness and I loved the Hell sequence late in the film, which I thought looked great.\n\nScrolling through the reviews, I'm seeing a lot of complaints about the fact that the lead character is a woman. I don't care. \"Doom Guy\" is a blank slate in the games and I honestly don't give a crap who fills his shoes. It's not like this scrawny little woman is pulling off absurd feats of strength. She's pulling triggers on guns.\n\nI've seen reviews call the movie \"feminist,\" just because the lead is a woman. Gender is NEVER brought up in the film in any way. There is no \"girl power\" message or equal rights agenda being pushed in your face. It's just an action movie where a small percentage of the gun-toting cast is female. I'm not insecure enough with my gender to get upset by this.\n\nI even saw one review that only brings up one negative: the marines say \"clear\" a lot. Really? People are so eager to hate this movie that they start nitpicking military protocol that's in every movie with soldiers in it?\n\nI came for demons and gore and that's what I got, with the badass Hell sequence being a cherry on top."

That said, the choice of casting here certainly did not help, at all. Do we really need yet another franchise where the main protaginists gender is changed? Are women out there REALLY clamoring for a female doom-guy? No. Ripley from Aliens was an incredible female lead, why? An original character. Joan \"the freak\" Ferguson from Wentworth, incredible female main character.....original. Janeway from StarTrek Voyager? Another great female lead. Brienne of Tarth from GOT, INSANELY AMAZING female character. Why the libs of Hollywood feel the need to keep swapping out established male roles with women, just for ticking the \"girl power\" box, is beyond me. Furthermore, whats with the casting? A 90lb girl whose 4ft nothing, is not exactly convincing as a badass. Would you cast Rick Morannis to play Braveheart? How about Elijah Wood as Thor?? It undermines women's push for more representation when, instead of creating new, fresh, original characters....Hollywood insists on just swapping out men for girls in established male franchises."

The agenda is to demasculinize young men.\n\nAnother reason being old isn't such a bad thing. I could have had to grow up with this foolishness.\n\nBesides the bad acting, a team of scientists deconstructed a man and reconstructed \"THEM\".\n\nI wonder what lame-brained Liberal girlie wrote this script. They couldn't say they reconstructed \"HIM\". And if it were a woman, I suspect she would have been referred to as \"THEM\" as well.\n\nThis gender-neutral nonsense is ridiculous. HIM and HER are apparently offensive terms now - because .000000000000000001% of the population are offended by the words.\n\nWait until somebody becomes offended by \"the\" and \"and\".\n\nHere's a quote from another review I like:\n\n\"No Doom Guy. There was a cameo of the guy from Wolfenstein, but he was dead. Just a bunch of SJW schlock.

        "review_detailed_main": "Being a DOOM video game fan, I was curious about this movie. Since I watched the trailer I already knew that this was not going to be a nice product. I decided to give it a shot anyway. DOOM Annihilation looks and feel very cheap: locations lacks on details, for monsters seems that they used discount costumes, guns had an horrible design, especially the BFG9000, seemed a toy plastic gun.\n\nActing is awful, I don't know where they find these actors, but most of all, I would like to know why they had the british accent. DOOM was developed in America in the 90s, the DOOM 2016 video game had actors with american accent, why they decided to put british actors on this movie? It does not make any sense. Usually I would pass on this detail, but not in this case.\n\nThe most iconic character of the game is naturally the DOOM guy, and here there is not, at least in the 2005 movie with The Rock, they tried to make something that remembered him. Here, instead, we found again on front of the necessity to have a female hero, that will save the day. I am not against it, and I always support writers that creates positive female characters, but in this specific case, you are just ruining the spirit of the original concept.\n\nTruth is that DOOM is not easy to adapt into a movie, because the game itself does not have lot of plot: it is just a guy that fights against demons that are trying to annihilate the Earth. It would be nice if for once they would decide to create a real nice narrative universe that explains the origin of these demons, but it needs to be a well written script.\n\nBy watching this movie, I really reevaluated the 2005 one that was better conceived. This is just a bunch of really bad stunt scenes mixed to very cheap CGI, which, for a movie of this kind is essential. I think that people that worked on the movie,already knew that this was going to be a bad movie, so they simply put a really famous name on the title and then released it."

About the only \"new\" feature is that the \"portal\" through which the baddies come is an interplanetary, possibly interstellar, teleportation device. NOT a significant addition if it is, in fact an addition, and I'm not certain that it is.\n\nIf you're a DOOM fan, then you've seen this exact same thing many times in many games and movies.\n\nIf you're NOT a DOOM fan, then DOOM: ANNIHILATION simply reads as THE WALKING DEAD on Phobos except without any real plot.\n\nLiterally, and I mean LITERALLY, you could just watch a DOOM gameplay recording on YouTube and see EXACTLY the same thing: \"So, BLAM BLAM BLAM, read BLAM BLAM BLAM, any BLAM BLAM BLAM, good BLAM BLAM BLAM, books BLAM BLAM BLAM, lately BLAM BLAM BLAM?\"\n\nNOT interesting, NOT engaging, NO new territory covered, the ULTIMATE in predictability and repetitiveness. The PAINFULLY obvious ending SO apparently leaving the door \"open\" for a (God forbid) sequel takes the word \"tedious\" to a whole new scale.\n\nTiresomely, there were \"cameo\" appearances by a sawed-off, double-barreled shotgun and the infamous BFG9000 in the hopes that supposed fanboys would maybe get a stiffy. In the DOOM games at least, the lucky recipient of a BFG9000 blast would get blown entirely to pieces. In THIS movie, all that happens is targets fall down like narcoleptics. They couldn't even get that right. They actually did the same old thing, only wrong.\n\nI kept thinking, \"Surely they're not gonna do this, right? NOBODY is going to make this story AGAIN with absolutely NOTHING new or interesting in it? NOBODY would do that, right?\"\n\nYep. It turns out that somebody would.\n\nFrom the very first DOOM game, one of the more interesting elements in its intrinsically repetitive nature was the presence of really weird, surrealistic monsters, like giant, floating heads with huge horns and teeth. All of the human zombie-things were just sort of background decoration for ambience. I kept hoping to see some interesting monsters in DOOM: ANNIHILATION thinking that at least that might alleviate some of the tedium.\n\nBut no. Just interminable periods of waves of human zombies all shot in more or less the same way and occasionally stabbed with a pig sticker for \"variety\". In terms of monsters, all we get are fixed-teeth \"demons\" that are just guys in rubber suits striking \"kewl\" poses.\n\nDisclaimer: I was a HUGE DOOM fan. In 1993. This movie has caused me to retroactively detest it. It's that bad."

Going by the 2016 reboot that delves much deeper into the lore. It's about a race of humanoid beings from a dimension similar to or shared with Hell and it's demons. These humanoid beings fought against the forces of hell for centuries using primitive weapons (spears, swords) and had inhuman strength fuelled from the dimension itself. One apparent remaining soldier known as Doom slayer; a white humanoid male in a green power suit of sorts ends up on earth, after the UAC's scientific team led by a shady head scientist with ulterior motives, unlocks a portal to Hell on Mars during an excavation. An invasion of the demons to Mars and then Earth ensues, and the Doom Slayer awakens in a UAC lab and suits up, then uses an array of powerful weaponry both primate and futuristic to do what their race does best; kill the demons. They have minimal support from the outmatched UAC marines and an elusive shunned scientist Samuel Hayden, that had their brain or likeness put into a large robotic body.\n\nWhat is this film then? A female UAC marine and her team residing on Mars, use plastic looking assault rifles, one marine uses an LMG that makes a whirl sound like the games minigun despite being an LMG, bizarrely. And even the infamous BFG 9000, which is portrayed as a pathetic weapon in the movie. They use these weapons to take on..2 of the franchises weakest demons (possessed humans, that look like blue vampires in this, and imps, that look like people in rubber Halloween costumes). But they are at least on Mars and an excavation does at least reveal portals that unleash the demons. There's a head scientist named after the one in Doom 3 that came out about 15 years ago (why not use source material from the lore rich reboot 3 years ago?) The head scientist being the only character from the franchise, looks nothing like the character however, and no other character from the source material...including the Doom Slayer, you know, which the whole franchise pivots on, is even in the movie. The premise without any spoilers (not that there's an ounce of this movie to spoil) is the marine woman helps stop the paltry demon invasion with her team.\n\nWhat do we have then? A B-movie in every sense of the word that very loosely follows the story of the game and pays hardly any attention to the source material. Til the point it is an insult to have the franchises name on the films cover. There is a strong trend currently of taking existing franchises, particularly those with white male leads and replacing them with female leads of an often misandrist nature. Although the producers made a tweet inciting this, the movie doesn't have any of the typical dialog and story arc that show this. It is just a case of it being a bad film and paying no attention whatsoever to the franchise itself. Had an original movie been made with this lead character and some original idea's, maybe it would've faired better. Original idea's cease to exist nowadays though and this is the result, avoid."

But still, as a movie buff, of course I took the time to sit down and watch it, believing in giving every movie a fair chance.\n\nTurns out that this 2019 movie by writer and director Tony Giglio wasn't particularly impressive in any way.

But on the other hand, it was so completely derivative and generic that it was bordering on being downright boring and laughable.\n\nThe CGI in the movie was fair for the most parts, despite the fact that the fire wielding and throwing creatures looked like something from a 1990s computer game. It was near impossible to take those creatures serious in any way.\n\nAs in terms of enjoyment and entertainment, then \"Doom: Annihilation\" is a weak entry in cinema. It hardly offered anything of any worth or value, and most definitely didn't bring anything new to the genre of movie adaptations based on computer games. Some times, you just stop and wonder 'why do they even make movies based on these games?'\n\nI endured the movie to the end. And while we are mentioning the end, then I will say that the ending here was a slap to the face with a cold, dead fish for us in the audience that actually gave the movie a chance and attempted to like it.\n\nAll in all, \"Doom: Annihilation\" manages to score a meager four out of ten stars from me."

It wasn't so much horror as cheesy action. So when you get another low budget movie called Doom, you can't really expect much. Silly weapons, evil demons, lots of shooting. And that is what you get, with some typical horror plot thrown in of experimentation with alien technology on Phobos, the compulsory arrogant scientist with a British accent, the brave soldier - which in this case is the really cute Amy Manson - and some bad CGI.\n\nIs it scary? Nope. You see everything coming a mile away. Is it funny? No. It takes itself seriously for some reason. It borrows the game elements: the levels, the weaponry, the colored key cards, and uses them in the plot, like they were supposed to make sense. Is the action amazing or the background story captivating? No. Like a blockbuster or a McDonald's burger, It's exactly what you would expect, with absolutely no surprises. The best part of the movie was how cute Amy Manson was."

Hardcore Henry is low budget but the film got 2 million dollars but with this ? this can't get even 1 million but no film is cheap like it coast less then 1 dollar more like 5 cents of coast of this movie. i don't understand why this film could off got bigger budget film, could budget the\n\nmoney make the film bigger with a Hardcore Henry style with Hotel Inferno 2 Cathedral of pain style. cinematography is good but it looks like 2005 film that was filmed and locked up and cover up all story thats what it looks like of film. i knew this was going to proper bad - low budget, cheap actors, mediocre director & no involvement from the authors of the original concept and all the games and didn't see Hardcore Henry or Hotel Inferno a film done for much, Much Cheaper than to DOOM Annihilation. director doesn't know to have idea and involvement to mix up style of DOOM film to be like hardcore Henry A movie that looks a lot more Doom than a flick called Doom. Also, being direct to video doesn't mean you need to incorporate things like 'conversations about who stole whose underwear' into a Doom flick. .the director Tony Giglio is director i don't like but at least i liked 2 of his films Jason statham and Wesley snipes film Chaos (2006) direct to DVD film i liked. and low budget version of SWAT under siege 3rd film. but with this i don't understand why he wanted to make a DOOM film i just don't understand why he wasn't right director for it. it's because he wanted to make it\n\n\n\nTony Giglio pitched to Universal his idea for a new film in 2015 but initially declined. The success of the 2016 DOOM video game convinced Universal to proceed and commission a script from Giglio i don't understand why Universal gave script without not looking at his records of his films he did, why didn't they run threw give him interview say to him how are you going to make a DOOM film but Universal is being idiots just to give script to him when he has no involvement from the authors of the original concept and all the games it's like they don't give a crap they just threw script to him without going threw of what and how would make film into but HEY look he made it into like a direct to DVD it is a basically Doom: The Syfy Edition that could be easily shown in SC-FI channel. The project was announced in April 2018, with principal photography commencing soon afterwards and ending in June 2018, with additional photography following in early 2019. Doom: Annihilation was released direct-to-video on October 1, 2019. sadly why can't Universal get a budget at least 1-3 million dollar film can't make DOOM with a bigger budget.\n\nnow with this film lead actress (Amy Manson) Joan Dark known for Touchwood TV series, not another happy ending, T2 Trainspotting she did another TV series and movies. she is great lead character i liked she is worth it i love strong female action movies i really do but she has been given a bad script, and in a wrong film she can be actress who can play in Alien franchise or Predator franchise she is a very strong female character in this movie i liked her she was more enjoyable in film much more then anyone who play's in film. you have\n\nanother characters Daisy (Gina Phillips) known Jeepers Creepers, Love and Debate, Hijacked i haven't seen her since Hijacked and recently new Jeepers Creepers 3 as cameo but she did fine in film, Chaplain (Louis Mandylor) known my big fat Greek wedding, The Quest, so many another movies he wasn't in it as much but he is their. the action horror scenes where people are meant to be possessed by demons but they were zombies feels like i am watching Paul W Anderson very first Resident Evil (2002) but it's not in lab it's in space. throughout film one by one characters get wasted pretty quickly. and film looked like a looks like a school project, like you see this film in SC-FI channel in Tuesday night sadly i don't know how in earth someone would make a DOOM movie a direct to DVD that's shocking as well because i hope one day down the road i wanted to see big budget DOOM film just like (2005) DOOM with Rock. but no Hollywood don't learn their lessons with another (2005) DOOM flopped and if you hated (2005) DOOM i don't understand why ? but this film you should hate even much more and believe me it's worser then (2005) DOOM film witch i enjoyed. with this their is Easter eggs like helmets from game are in this movie and double barrel shotgun is in it as well just like\n\nin game and some others, the BFG weapon worked and looked better in DOOM (2005) what Rock uses, but in this film eh BFG looked like a toy like someone would bring it to comic con, and when main chick curry's BFG it's bigger then her like if you put it top of her head she would drop to her knees the gun BFG looks much, much more bigger then her look at imagine of her carrying it that's why the BFG looked fake that was stupid choice because that's for bigger person would carry that like Rock could carry that he is big just like BFG, in film sadly it's not same what you look at game or 2005 film, the BFG doesn't blow everything up at room. she shoots demons one by one it doesn't destroy everything sadly but it doesn't happen. (Amy Manson) Joan Dark good actress but the script and what she has been told to do is terrible in film but she is not terrible actress just script was rubbish. the props are awful and the FX must have been done in windows paint. the film is just okay to watch it's not worst film i ever seen in my entire life but i seen worser like House of Dead or Alone in the Dark those are worst. but this i liked because of lead actress and action was just fun and fast pacing but this wasn't great it's not something i want to watch all time i rather watch (2005) DOOM and that doesn't do any justice at all this is something you watch it for once then you move on and never think of seeing it again, it's not really of worst films ever in my opinion."

        "review_title": "Why people hate \"Doom: Annihilation\" when it's actually a good Doom movie.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Hi everyone, I've been a fan of Doom since I was about 10 years old. I know, it's not the most child-friendly game for that age, but I casually played it and it has been a part my deep passion for the shooter video game genre.\n\nIf you have only discovered the Doom saga with the last two games, namely \"Doom 2016\" and \"Doom Eternal\" then in my opinion you should not even watch the latest movie adaptation of the series, namely \"Doom: Annihilation\". But let's start from the beginning: As we know, there have been a lot of movies that tried to revive the success of various video games in a cinematographic context, but unfortunately, having money is not enough. In fact, the authors need to have the right knowledge of the work on which they have to work on and also a minimum of passion in doing so. We saw how many movies based on video games are actually garbage such as the Uwe Boll movies, just awful...\n\nBut let me tell you that \"Doom: Annihilation\" was created in a totally different way; in addition to having personally seen it I was also lucky enough to talk with the director Tony Giglio. This movie was born because him is a true FAN of the genre, and not only Doom but also a fan of all the best old school FPS of few decades ago. Just think of the reference linked to \"Wolfenstein\" contained in the movie.\n\nSo you may be wondering: why was the movie judged negatively? I'm here today to try to clarify and convince you that maybe you watched this movie from a totally wrong perspective. Let's start from the beginning: Universal is the famous movie production company that currently holds the rights to produce a Doom movie. Therefore, it should be specified that these rights are limited exclusively to the old Doom games, which are: \"Doom (1993)\", \"Doom II\", \"Doom 64\" and \"Doom 3\"; this is a fundamental point since many people have unfortunately known the video game only through the 2016 \"reboot\" by Bethesta company (This videogame company does not want to sell the rights to a movie based on the games \"Doom 2016\" and \"Doom Eternal\" for the moment).\n\nBut in my opinion, this is not necessarily a bad thing. It can be for many who would like to see the Doom Slayer in frenetic scenes where he rips off demons with metal music and that's it. I have certainly appreciated all the Doom videogames released so far, but I always consider the classic Doom games as the best.\n\nReturning to Universal, this has certainly shown interest for an attempt to launch the Doom brand also in cinematographic context, but unfortunately it immediately failed with the flop of the famous movie with The Rock, and if we wanted to talk about this for a moment, I personally appreciated that movie, but it has obvious problems that cannot be ignored. I could go deeper, but we are here for Doom Annihilation and I would not like to dwell too long.\n\nNow let's get to it: Tony Giglio's movie\"Doom: Annihilation\" comes from a completely different pretext: the pure desire to do it, and at any cost! A passion that is hardly found in these contexts, so if you thought that Universal had produced this new movie to try to make money by spending little money, you are totally off track. The company has never proposed on its own initiative a new attempt to capitalize on the success of Doom franchise, in fact this movie exists only because an ordinary director wanted it, and somehow managed to get a small budget to work on it (really small).\n\nNow I'm going to talk about the movie itself; It's a movie that pays homage to the original story of the very first Doom videogame, more than it seems! But it also takes a lot from \"Doom 3\" and \"Doom 64\". Previously, the doomguy was not definable as a character, but the representation of the player in the role of the Doom marine, who is the only survivor of his group, and this is exactly the initial incpit!\n\nA group of marines is sent to the Martian base \"Phobos\" following a mysterious invasion. Then all the marines, except one, are killed by demons. So when it comes to Doom story, we know that all the characters are destined to end badly, except for the protagonist. The problem is that many people consider Doom a game based exclusively on an iconic character, but that's because Id software under Bethesda developed the story in this way, effectively creating the Slayer. But we must remember that the doomguy WAS mainly an ordinary marine who proved to be more skilled, and for this reason destined to face the demons.\n\nIn the movie we have as protagonist the lieutenant \"Joan Dark\". There would be many things to say about her, for example that it is also a reference to \"Joan of Arc\", but for this there is already another article written by other people. But what you only need to know is that she is the purest representation of the doomguy in this movie, as she is the only marine who proves to be able to get to hell. We can define her as doomgirl.\n\nI really appreciated the fact that the doomguy is not a specific character, but that he or she is the one who could get to the point of facing and defeating the demons. The starting point of the story of all dooms has always been this. We're not talking about a series like Duke Nukem that is mainly based on a specific character, namely the \"Duke\", and I think this is the best example: \"making a movie based on Duke Nukem without Duke Nukem\" that would be ridiculous. Doom is not like that. Now let's talk about the remaining of the plot: very faithful to the concept of teleportation and demons trying to invade the earth.\n\nI could talk for hours about how the antagonist of Doom 3 \"Dr. Malcolm Betruger\" is the most apt for this context, and how it has been adapted perfectly, going from being a character in a videogame to becoming the character of a movie, but I'm trying not to make this review too long, this to make sure that it is read by many people, so I could go deeper on another occasion. Speaking of demons, their appearance is clearly based on the chapter dedicated for the Nintendo 64 console, namely \"Doom 64\" (We even have the arch-vile!).\n\nIn addition to this, you can see all the stuff that seem to come directly from the classic Doom videogames such as: colored keys, the medical station, the portals of the archaeological excavations and the BFG with its GREEN plasma concentrate (unlike the BLUE version of the first movie)!\n\nSo, you can see that the author is a true fan of the classic Doom videogames, and has managed with a very small budget to make a movie definitely SUPERIOR to many shitty projects with millions of dollars wasted. It is clear that, in this movie, many action scenes do not shine in terms of spectacularity, but everything possible has been done to manage the little money available.\n\nDoom is my favorite shooter saga ever, and I enjoyed this movie as a tribute to this wonderful and spectacular saga. I much preferred a \"poor\" movie rather than nothing or a movie maybe with spectacular special effects but without the true soul of the video game. What I don't realize is that the only way to get more out of this is to start supporting and showing appreciation for small projects like this. Only then will studios like Universal decide to pour lots of money, but we must also be able to recognize the enormous difference between video games and movies. Even the ending (without spoilers) is very faithful to the original story; do you remember what happens at the end of the very first chapter of The very first Doom videogame? \"Knee-Depp in the Dead\"?\n\nHere. I would be really excited about a sequel. There was also the question of the fact that \"ID Software\" claimed not to be involved in development, but thank f**k I would say... ID Software works on videogames, they are not workers in the cinematography industry and has simply claimed an obvious thing. This means absolutely nothing, I have always found it ridiculous to bring up this fact just to criticize the existence of the movie. Like it or not as it should be, tastes are tastes. The problem is when people criticize in a \"objective way\" even though they are not experts of the original work.\n\nThis movie is in fact a small tribute, wanted by a fan, who certainly wanted to reinterpret the formula of the game in his own way, but this in the right way and with little money available. Try to see it for what it is and you will realize how beautiful and profound this movie is for us true fans."

This movie would have been horribly received and wouldn't be able to recoup it's budget if more work was done to the movie if it was released into theaters, but still have the same plot, story, and characters at the same time. For a direct to video movie, it's not that bad. Yes, it doesn't have the Doom guy in it, which would be amazing. You have to at least give the people credit for trying with this.

The actors stumble around like a bunch of drunk college kids, flagging each other with their weapons, tripping over their own feet. If this is the stuff they left in the movie, how bad was the stuff cut out I wonder. Watching them go down the first ladder was cringe inducing. Did they even rehearse the scene? It was obvious the actors had no idea what they were doing as they tried to figure out what to do with their props while they climbed. It has nothing to do with the game Doom either.\n\nAVOID THIS MOVIE!"

There were a lot of continuity errors, like in one scene you can see the protagonist's hair is wet and in one style, and immediately when she turns her head, it's dry and in a different style. There are tons of errors like this that are easy to spot. The trailer of the film was deceiving. It certainly is much better than that garbage of a trailer. Now onto the main part, as an adaptation of a game, how is it? Well, nope, not good. It is an okay horror film, but the only few related things with the games are the aesthetics. The setup is not even the same as the main game story. You can take it as a side-story, but it still doesn't relate to the game's story at all. Overall, for a direct-to-video movie, yeah it's enjoyable."

All the bodies except for the special cases are intact, with blood smeared on them. A traumatized woman that wouldn't even speak somehow becomes calm and coherent as soon as she meets up with another character that she's not even close to.\n\nThe story feels like Rogue One, where nothing substancial actually happens, and it ends in a direction which is supposed to be a cliffhanger, but you know wat actually happens in the canon universe. The ending is just horrible, and the rest of the movie basically shows things being killed.\n\nI think some parts of the movie tried to have twist, mystery, or sci-fi factor. All of it felt like whatever. There were some stunts which they expected to pass for action. It didn't. The MC was more lucky than John Wick, and pretty much lacked as much in skill, as in they pretty much survived by blind luck, or just so they could get to that terrible ending."

It is a masterpiece compared to this.\n\nThe dialogues are on the level of what hollywood generally has produced in the past years - filled with cliches, sexual references that are out of place and plain dumb, and so much idiocy that you seriously have to wonder why the humanity of the future has not yet blown itself up. Rational thinking? What's that, can you eat it? Do they hire scriptwriters out of pre-school?\n\nClearly the only qualification for any and all jobs - be it scientist, engineer, pilot or military personnel - is that one is able to yell incoherent things in an angry way, and try really hard to get into someone's pants. Oh and consume alcohol of course.\n\nI've given it two stars because the exterior scenes of the ship are decenly done and of notably higher quality than the rest of the VFX shots. That still does not make this a watchable movie. If you must, fast-forward through it."

By now, he should've been. But it's hard to put Doomguy in the forefront of a sci-fi horror mystery film, and I completely understand it. Many folks are saying the female lead is an SJW thing, but I'd have to disagree. It doesn't come across like that to me, at all, but the movie definitely doesn't feel any closer to the games, as an adaptation. I get why fans would be mad. At least the first film adaptation had tons of gore and cool moments. It's very stylish, which is a plus. This film doesn't feel anywhere as cheap as most low-budget sci-fi flicks, but it certainly feels like a straight-to-DVD flick (which it is lol).\n\nI will say this: the last ten minutes or so were awesome, and I wish the budget allowed for way more of that. THAT was what cinematic Doom's film adaptation should be more like, by the time it ends.\n\nIn the end, I'd say the film doesn't drop the ball, but it certainly struggles to hold it still.\n\nIt's a big, dumb horror science movie, and it doesn't need intelligence (just like the games)."

Luke Allen-Gale, or should I say Daniel Jackson, did a reasonable job portraying that character, shame that it wasn't Stargate, he may have pulled it off. Overall, I would say that it just below average as some of the acting was a bit dubious. I would recommend it."

Check. Cheesy nods to id software like exploding barrels and chainsaws (honestly though, I stopped watching before barrels exploded or chainsaws were used) with a corpse named Blazkowicz and a zombified scientist named Carmack thrown in?

The only good movies being made anymore come from Asia (Parasyte), Italy (They Call Me Jeeg), Hungary (Kut, Kills on Wheels). People today downvote the only ones that are good!!!

This one at least has demons and hell in it and is trying to input doom into it were the rock one didnt even try to include any element of doom into it.

It takes the general theme of \"Starship Troopers,\" and fuses it with all the crappy parts of the \"Resident Evil\" series (which is basically everything after the first movie), and tweaks it with parts of \"Event Horizon\" and the video game series \"Dead Space\", and still manages to moderately disappoint.\n\nThe \"Doom\" game series has a reputation of being extremely violent, suspenseful, gory, and scary as hell. This movie does not represent any of that very well. It's well made considering the budget and everything else, but if you're a fan of the game series and the first movie, AND a fan of indie B horror movies, you might be part of a small group of people who'd actually enjoy the movie.\n\nThe acting is not good, but I've seen worse in blockbusters. The special effects are practical, for the most part, which earns a bit of respect. Some parts are genuinely creepy, and there are some direct references to the game series that are pretty cool. I like that the computer's name is \"Daisy\", an obvious reference to \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". But the writing is trash, the characters are cliche, the monsters aren't all that intimidating, and overall it's not scary at all. Some dudes in alien/demon costumes ain't gonna save this one. And it's not even that gory, so the gore hounds wouldn't feel satisfied at all.\n\nFun if you're with friends, and drunk or high probably, but not really worth it otherwise. Good try though, folks."

It feels written by someone who learned to speak English by watching Roger Corman movies. But there is really only so much the actors can do with the material given. I believe this is a first time director, at least it feels that way.\n\nThe sets are fine, but not always lit well giving some of the facades an extremely phony appearance. The special visual effects are adequate to the caliber of the rest of the movie. The practical effects are fine. It was nice to see practical blood (sometimes).\n\nThis movie truly feels like a Sci-Fi channel original film that everyone involved thought would be a theatrical release (except for the producers). This film doesn't really fit into the Doom video game lore. It works almost better as a Ghosts of Mars soft-reboot or RE: In Space.\n\nIt isn't as bad as most of the reviews make it out to be. But it still isn't good. And it doesn't quite cross that line of being so bad it's good either. Just mediocre at best.\n\nIt is currently on Netflix (Jan 2020) if you feel the need to watch it.

But then again, how hard can it be to navigate to some cargo containers that are light up in yellow, futuristic neon light?\n\nI was going to give this movie a 1/10, just as an honest rating of this B-movie. But then I did enjoy seeing a female protagonist and hero that was neither skinny nor excessivly muscular. She totally out acted her male counterparts and I was almost getting a little Alicia Vikander vibes from her. Hopefully she'll be getting some better scripts in the future, to help support her efforts in front of the camera.\n\nAlso, not all scenery was totally bad - even on a minimalistic budget - but sadly you never get the all anticipated POV storytelling anywhere in this movie. Most likely also due to the small budget.\n\nBut at least, this is a little enjoyable for all of us that have spent hours and days with the game back in the days.

First of all, we actually have demons, zombies and a hint at Hell...unlike the complete absence of the Hell concept with the last one. It was as if the writers actually played the game and tried to respect it.\n\nOf course the budget constraints were obvious. The throw away characters were horribly acted, but the main characters delivered a passable performance.

A total rip off from Joanna Dark in the Perfect Dark game-a completely different game title! Really?? I can tell this is going to be a rough ride, but I'm going to sit here and endure it because it's Doom. But why did they have to green light this low of production quality for such a classic game? Frustrating.."

        "review_detailed_main": "Even as a big fan of the games, and the 2005 film being a guilty pleasure, I went into this with absolutely zero expectations given its almost universally negative reception. Whilst this is by no means a good film, it ended up being surprisingly better than I was expecting. The plot generally follows the games, where scientists on Mars' Phobos moon create a teleporter that unwittingly allows an army (well, 3 or 4) demons through. A small military squad gets sent to investigate, you can guess the rest.\n\nThe effects and cgi aren't too bad considering the very limited budget, but the props and scenery are where the cheapness really shows through. It's very obvious that they only had 1 monster suit, about 5 people playing zombies and 3 sets, which they use multiple times with different lighting. The guns look like they're made of plastic and the uniforms are like something from a paintball game. But despite it's many, many problems, it does at least feel like they tried with what little resources they had. There are a fair few references to the game, some which work and some that feel completely shoehorned in (such as the \"I'm your ultra nightmare\" line). Ultimately though it kept me reasonably entertained for 90 minutes, so can't really ask for more than that."
