      "|tt0120737|The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|8.9         |Simply incredible. Never before have I seen a 3 hour movie that didn't seem like 3 hours. I read the Lord of the Rings very recently and I was surprised at how similar Peter Jackson's vision was to my own.\\n\\nNow about the omissions and alterations. I'm not a crazed fanatic who gets worked up over every little detail. I didn't mind Arwen's inflation and I'm actually glad Tom Bombadil was scrubbed (I felt Tom Bombadil was an unnecessary addition to the book). Despite these minor changes, the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well (and the prologue was a nice touch).\\n\\nThe acting was flawless. As I've read many many times in other reviews, McKellen doesn't play Gandalf, he IS Gandalf. Wood, Mortensen, Holm, Astin, everyone was fantastic. My hat's off to Sean Bean who delivers an excellent performance as Boromir, a character who's intentions are good but wrestles with the corrupting power of the Ring. Bean portrays it VERY well. Oh, and Andy Serkis does a PERFECT Gollum voice. It's EXACTLY as I imagined it myself.\\n\\nThe special effects were incredible, the cave troll, the balrog, Gollum, and Sauron's Eye all looked amazing. I was also very impressed by the seamless shrinking of the vertically challenged characters.\\n\\nWhat's wrong with this movie? I have no idea... I thought everything was perfect. MY biggest gripe is having to wait an entire year to see The Two Towers!|10           |An absolutely incredible film!|NRGWasp          |\n",
      "|tt0120737|The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|8.9         |(95%) If the late 70's early 80's had the Star wars trilogy, then the 2000's had this epic fantasy masterclass. Regardless of whether you're a fantasy fan or not this is too good a movie to simply pass up, and it will be one of those movies that given time will prove it to be a classic. The deeper you look into this the more one notices that every single aspect really is a truly impressive accomplishment. The fact that every single sword used by the main characters was made by hand, with extra ones made only for carrying, fighting, etc, then there's the costumes/armor/props all made by teams of many people. They even made artificial trees for gods sake. But really all those things are just extras, what really makes this a unique watch is that it really does feel huge and sweeping, the sense of scale is fantastic and I can't think of anything that even comes close to matching it. What every epic flick needs this has, the cast is great, it's exciting, it has bags of character, it's funny, sad, superbly well made, with a great score and plenty of action. It's also one of very few 2 hour 30 minute + movies ever that leaves the audience wanting more. Since watching it around Christmas 2001 at a packed out cinema, and the many times I've seen it on DVD since, it never fails to impress and charm. All in all near perfect cinematic treat that keeps on giving.                                                  |10           |Thank you Mr Jackson          |adamscastlevania2|\n",

      "|tt0120737|The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|8.9         |Simply incredible. Never before have I seen a 3 hour movie that didn't seem like 3 hours. I read the Lord of the Rings very recently and I was surprised at how similar Peter Jackson's vision was to my own.\\n\\nNow about the omissions and alterations. I'm not a crazed fanatic who gets worked up over every little detail. I didn't mind Arwen's inflation and I'm actually glad Tom Bombadil was scrubbed (I felt Tom Bombadil was an unnecessary addition to the book). Despite these minor changes, the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well (and the prologue was a nice touch).\\n\\nThe acting was flawless. As I've read many many times in other reviews, McKellen doesn't play Gandalf, he IS Gandalf. Wood, Mortensen, Holm, Astin, everyone was fantastic. My hat's off to Sean Bean who delivers an excellent performance as Boromir, a character who's intentions are good but wrestles with the corrupting power of the Ring. Bean portrays it VERY well. Oh, and Andy Serkis does a PERFECT Gollum voice. It's EXACTLY as I imagined it myself.\\n\\nThe special effects were incredible, the cave troll, the balrog, Gollum, and Sauron's Eye all looked amazing. I was also very impressed by the seamless shrinking of the vertically challenged characters.\\n\\nWhat's wrong with this movie? I have no idea... I thought everything was perfect. MY biggest gripe is having to wait an entire year to see The Two Towers!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |10           |An absolutely incredible film!                                                 |NRGWasp          |\n",
      "|tt0120737|The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|8.9         |(95%) If the late 70's early 80's had the Star wars trilogy, then the 2000's had this epic fantasy masterclass. Regardless of whether you're a fantasy fan or not this is too good a movie to simply pass up, and it will be one of those movies that given time will prove it to be a classic. The deeper you look into this the more one notices that every single aspect really is a truly impressive accomplishment. The fact that every single sword used by the main characters was made by hand, with extra ones made only for carrying, fighting, etc, then there's the costumes/armor/props all made by teams of many people. They even made artificial trees for gods sake. But really all those things are just extras, what really makes this a unique watch is that it really does feel huge and sweeping, the sense of scale is fantastic and I can't think of anything that even comes close to matching it. What every epic flick needs this has, the cast is great, it's exciting, it has bags of character, it's funny, sad, superbly well made, with a great score and plenty of action. It's also one of very few 2 hour 30 minute + movies ever that leaves the audience wanting more. Since watching it around Christmas 2001 at a packed out cinema, and the many times I've seen it on DVD since, it never fails to impress and charm. All in all near perfect cinematic treat that keeps on giving.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |10           |Thank you Mr Jackson                                                           |adamscastlevania2|\n",
      "|tt0120737|The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|8.9         |The first part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Fellowship of the Rings opened the door to a whole new world for me. I'd never read any of Tolkien's books when I saw the film for the first time at the theatre and, now that I've read them, in retrospect I think being a neophyte to the mythology made my LOTR movie experience all the more miraculous.\\n\\nI loved The Two Towers and Return of the King almost as much as FOTR, but not quite, because seeing Fellowship for the first time was like taking a journey to a fabulous new place and meeting incredible new friends that you don't want to leave. I've never felt anything quite like what this epic evoked in me. It was akin to being a child again, with that tireless sense of wonder and enjoyment of each and every moment, maybe because as a child you are discovering your surroundings, and whatever age you are, when you watch the Fellowship of the Ring you are rendered in awe upon being introduced to the purity and beauty of Middle Earth and darkly enthralled by the majesty of Eisengard, Saruman, Sauron and all of their mighty malice. One of the things that makes this movie so special (and there are so many!) is that you fall in love not only with the \"good\" characters, but also with the \"evil\" ones. For example, Christopher Lee was amazing as Saruman, and I can't imagine the movie without him.\\n\\nSome films that might be comparable to the Lord of the Rings trilogy are: The Fifth Element, the Star Wars Trilogy parts IV, V and VI (forget the newer prequels), the Matrix trilogy (especially the first part), Interview with a Vampire, the Legend of Sleepy Hollow (with Johnny Depp), Logan's Run and The Island. They are all excellent movies and works of art that weave that movie magic that keeps you spellbound and entranced for the duration of their runtime.\\n\\nBut after seeing The Fellowship of the Ring, I knew I had found the movie by which I would judge all other movies. Based on J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved books, Peter Jackson has set a new standard in the industry of cinema, one that I honestly think has not and won't be surpassed, at least not in my lifetime, not even by PJ himself.\\n\\nIt is truly an instant classic that will stand the test of time and be loved by generations to come. God Bless Tolkien and Jackson and everyone involved in the conception and making of this film, for creating a world that is at my fingertips, only takes the touch of a button to go to whenever I want, and makes me forget everything else.\\n\\nThe LOTR Trilogy is undoubtedly MY precious, the non plus ultra of all movies!|10           |The Fellowship of the Ring: Not just a Movie, but the Door to another Dimension|bonnie91         |\n",

      "|tt0118715|The Big Lebowski       |8.1         |Jeff Bridges is perfect as Jeff Lebowski, a.k.a. The Dude; he's an ageing, amiable slacker who doesn't do much with his time besides bowl. When he's mistaken for a rich man (David Huddleston) with the same name, he's hired by the rich man to deliver a ransom. Things go from bad to worse in a hurry, in large part because The Dude frequently involves his loud, abrasive buddy Walter (John Goodman), a crazed Vietnam vet, in his actions.\\n\\nIn terms of the overall Coen brothers filmography, this is relatively minor stuff. It goes on a little too long, and wasn't always terribly funny to this viewer. It also feels self-indulgent at times. And yet, Joel and Ethan here craft a twist-laden, elaborate story that does have some good moments, as well as a highly profane script and an eclectic soundtrack. (The Dude hates The Eagles, but is a big fan of CCR.) Its quotes certainly entered the public consciousness in a big way, with Bridges quickly becoming a pop culture icon in his role. \"Well, you know, that's just like your opinion, man.\"\\n\\nThe main reason it worked to any degree (at least for this viewer) was because of its impressive and well-chosen cast: Sam Elliott (as a friendly narrator), Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi (as in \"Shut the *beep* up, Donny!\"), Philip Seymour Hoffman, Tara Reid, Peter Stormare, David Thewlis, Flea, Ben Gazzara, Jon Polito, etc. John Turturro is such a hoot as a bowler named Jesus that it's too bad that his screen time is so limited.\\n\\n\"The Big Lebowski\" is a truly character-driven comedy that does wrap up in a typically amusing way, and it shows that its main character can't just be dismissed as a non-thinking deadbeat; he knows when he's been used. It gave this viewer a conclusion that earned an honest smile, as Elliott breaks the fourth wall and comments on the nature of the yarn with which he's regaled us.\\n\\nSeven out of 10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |7            |This ol' movie really ties the collection together.                     |Hey_Sweden         |This ol' movie really ties the collection together. : Jeff Bridges is perfect as Jeff Lebowski, a.k.a.

And yet, Joel and Ethan here craft a twist-laden, elaborate story that does have some good moments, as well as a highly profane script and an eclectic soundtrack. (The Dude hates The Eagles, but is a big fan of CCR.) Its quotes certainly entered the public consciousness in a big way, with Bridges quickly becoming a pop culture icon in his role. \"Well, you know, that's just like your opinion, man.\"\\n\\nThe main reason it worked to any degree (at least for this viewer) was because of its impressive and well-chosen cast: Sam Elliott (as a friendly narrator), Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi (as in \"Shut the *beep* up, Donny!\"), Philip Seymour Hoffman, Tara Reid, Peter Stormare, David Thewlis, Flea, Ben Gazzara, Jon Polito, etc. John Turturro is such a hoot as a bowler named Jesus that it's too bad that his screen time is so limited.\\n\\n\"The Big Lebowski\" is a truly character-driven comedy that does wrap up in a typically amusing way, and it shows that its main character can't just be dismissed as a non-thinking deadbeat; he knows when he's been used. It gave this viewer a conclusion that earned an honest smile, as Elliott breaks the fourth wall and comments on the nature of the yarn with which he's regaled us.\\n\\nSeven out of 10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n",

Everything keept on circling around being a looser, hanging with similar people, wasting your time, smoking weed and looking for conspiracy theories.\\n\\nIn conclusion: Back in the 90's we called that \"trash comedy\" and If you like it, than be my guest and watch it ASAP, , otherwise take a walk and get some fresh air.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

The story makes more sense if you watch the movie ten times or so. The characters in the movie are the most entertaining I have ever seen, and make the movie worth watching as much as possible.

      "|tt0110912|Pulp Fiction           |8.9         |I saw this in the theater with my girlfriend because she had seen it with some friends and said it was so good. I made it through the whole thing SOMEHOW, and as we were walking through the parking lot I just started thinking that this movie has sucked over 2 hours of life from me and I'll never get it back. I honestly felt dumber for watching the whole thing. There is nothing good about this movie except a couple of members of the cast (NOT Travolta nor Thurman) and their ability was limited due to the awful script. There is nothing groundbreaking about this movie, the dialog is boring, the characters have no depth.

I made it through the whole thing SOMEHOW, and as we were walking through the parking lot I just started thinking that this movie has sucked over 2 hours of life from me and I'll never get it back. I honestly felt dumber for watching the whole thing. There is nothing good about this movie except a couple of members of the cast (NOT Travolta nor Thurman) and their ability was limited due to the awful script. There is nothing groundbreaking about this movie, the dialog is boring, the characters have no depth. It seems like it was made on a 24 hour deadline and they had plenty of spare time to go back and add an \"F\" word anywhere there was a space. I wouldn't have cared less if Tarantino had had another character that built an atomic bomb that accidentally detonated and wiped out everyone in this collection of trash. This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen, especially for something so highly praised.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

By believing that what we want is possible we can still end up with the result we want but a great deal of heartache can be avoided if we open our proverbial eyes and get out of our own way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

      "|tt1045658|Silver Linings Playbook|7.7         |Feels like the most standard movie. Good acting and production, decent screenplay. Some dialogues are the typical blah-blah, others are better and even a bit emotionally touching.

      "|tt1045658|Silver Linings Playbook|7.7         |If a friend asked me what watching Silver Linings Playbook is like, I might say, 'It's a bit like watching a train wreck, filled with crazy people and served up as a dark rom-com slash drama.' However, for the purposes of this review, I'll be more politically correct and describe it as a film about people who care for each other while managing their respective mental illnesses. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence both come off as a bit over-the-top angry and frantic, Robert DeNiro's character struggles with OCD, and others with smaller roles seem to struggle with mental health as well.\\n\\nWith most of the movie shot with a Steadicam, the resulting camera work gives the movie a low-budget feel. The shaky, unsteady shots add to the sense of chaos and frenetic instability, making it hard to look away even when it feels uncomfortable.\\n\\nIn terms of music, a great selection of licensed recordings are used, such as \"Girl from the North Country\" by Bob Dylan with Johnny Cash. However, the sparse use of an original non-diegetic score creates a quiet that makes each scene feel stark and somber.\\n\\nThe film's blend of dark humor, raw emotion, and intense portrayals of mental illness create a film that's hard to sit through.

However, for the purposes of this review, I'll be more politically correct and describe it as a film about people who care for each other while managing their respective mental illnesses. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence both come off as a bit over-the-top angry and frantic, Robert DeNiro's character struggles with OCD, and others with smaller roles seem to struggle with mental health as well.\\n\\nWith most of the movie shot with a Steadicam, the resulting camera work gives the movie a low-budget feel. The shaky, unsteady shots add to the sense of chaos and frenetic instability, making it hard to look away even when it feels uncomfortable.\\n\\nIn terms of music, a great selection of licensed recordings are used, such as \"Girl from the North Country\" by Bob Dylan with Johnny Cash. However, the sparse use of an original non-diegetic score creates a quiet that makes each scene feel stark and somber.\\n\\nThe film's blend of dark humor, raw emotion, and intense portrayals of mental illness create a film that's hard to sit through. But, the biggest problem with this movie is the story which is generally weak and unsatisfying.

      "|tt0108052|Schindler's List       |9.0         |One of the on living legendary pieces made ever, you could easily cry, it is one of the movies I discovered way later only realizing that not every one of the people working with the Germans was bad, there were a few good ones.\\n\\nAlso the dominant use of hard light in the film gave it the old 40's mood and vibe that made us feel as part of the people in that time.\\n\\nIt is also interesting how the director chose to high light the girl in red a color that stood out in black and really made it very powerful.\\n\\nIt was interesting to discover how good of an actor liam Neeson is given that time, because to be honest most people knew him from the film \"Taken\" at least for average movie watchers.

the movies I discovered way later only realizing that not every one of the people working with the Germans was bad, there were a few good ones.\\n\\nAlso the dominant use of hard light in the film gave it the old 40's mood and vibe that made us feel as part of the people in that time.\\n\\nIt is also interesting how the director chose to high light the girl in red a color that stood out in black and really made it very powerful.\\n\\nIt was interesting to discover how good of an actor liam Neeson is given that time, because to be honest most people knew him from the film \"Taken\" at

      "|tt0108052|Schindler's List       |9.0         |Schindler's List is not my favorite movie of all time, but it must be considered as one of (if not) the greatest films ever made. It starts slow and builds and builds. After five minutes it will not let you go until the end.

      "|tt0369226|Alone in the Dark      |2.4         |In the early 90's Atari was Atari, and Resident Evil a twinkle in Capcom's collective psyche. Alone in the Dark, however, having been developed by then upcoming French publisher Inforgrames, was already doing the rounds, busy inventing the third person, variable camera genre that one day would give gamers stuff from the various Res Ev titles to more contemporary efforts like Silent Hill, Devil May Cry and Onimusha.\\n\\nTherefore to see AITD's movie conversion owing so much to Resident Evil's big screen tenure struck one as deeply ironic. How did the tables turn so? It doesn't really matter, because at least for the first hour, director Uwe Boll's action flick kept its act together by providing solid, rollicking adventure fare with heaps more charm than the last RE entry ever mustered. The film displayed the same smooth execution we saw in Boll's 2004 video game interpretation, House of the Dead, and hopefully serves as harbinger of good news for his helming of another game-to-celluloid metamorphosis, coming attraction Far Cry.\\n\\nAnyway, AITD the movie had very little to do with its game namesake, since none of the original series' Call of Cthulu Gothic charm made its way through, neither did the misty, almost Victorian locales cross over in the transition. Chief protagonist Edward Carnby has returned, done by Christian Slater in a much needed chance at coming back into Hollywood's limelight-infused embrace. Slater gave a respectable go at doing Carnby, although he decidedly lacked any serious one liners, thus depriving Alone in the Dark serious merit. The producers, to our joy, chose to stick with an R rating by not cutting out the gore and good language, somewhat negating the effects of dry, choppy dialogue segments bereft any memorable moments.\\n\\nOther characters included archaeologist Aline (Tara Reid) and paranormal investigation Bureau 713 chief Burke Richards (Stephen Dorff). In the story, Carnby, himself employed as detective in all things unreal and spooky, just came back \"to town\" (Vancouver looking a bit too much like Raccoon City) bearing an ancient artifact from a long-lost civilization. Demented professor Hudgens (Matthew Walker) wanted the relic for his world domination scheme, of course, and since he and Carnby shared a sordid past, their paths soon crossed as a chase to get the item in question ensued, taking viewers to several locations. Bureau 713, led by Dorff, stepped in to save humanity from Hudgens' plans, and proceeded to engage armies of creatures known as Xenos in several quite impressive battle scenes as part of the overall plot progression.\\n\\nAITD looked and felt like a B movie most of the time, adding to its charm, assuming you're forgivingly inclined. Sure, the CGI wasn't up to major release standards, but such minor niggles became easy to ignore amid the film's overall enjoyable content and surprisingly absorbing action.

Alone in the Dark, however, having been developed by then upcoming French publisher Inforgrames, was already doing the rounds, busy inventing the third person, variable camera genre that one day would give gamers stuff from the various Res Ev titles to more contemporary efforts like Silent Hill, Devil May Cry and Onimusha.\\n\\nTherefore to see AITD's movie conversion owing so much to Resident Evil's big screen tenure struck one as deeply ironic. How did the tables turn so? It doesn't really matter, because at least for the first hour, director Uwe Boll's action flick kept its act together by providing solid, rollicking adventure fare with heaps more charm than the last RE entry ever mustered. The film displayed the same smooth execution we saw in Boll's 2004 video game interpretation, House of the Dead, and hopefully serves as harbinger of good news for his helming of another game-to-celluloid metamorphosis, coming attraction Far Cry.\\n\\nAnyway, AITD the movie had very little to do with its game namesake, since none of the original series' Call of Cthulu Gothic charm made its way through, neither did the misty, almost Victorian locales cross over in the transition. Chief protagonist Edward Carnby has returned, done by Christian Slater in a much needed chance at coming back into Hollywood's limelight-infused embrace. Slater gave a respectable go at doing Carnby, although he decidedly lacked any serious one liners, thus depriving Alone in the Dark serious merit. The producers, to our joy, chose to stick with an R rating by not cutting out the gore and good language, somewhat negating the effects of dry, choppy dialogue segments bereft any memorable moments.\\n\\nOther characters included archaeologist Aline (Tara Reid) and paranormal investigation Bureau 713 chief Burke Richards (Stephen Dorff). In the story, Carnby, himself employed as detective in all things unreal and spooky, just came back \"to town\" (Vancouver looking a bit too much like Raccoon City) bearing an ancient artifact from a long-lost civilization. Demented professor Hudgens (Matthew Walker) wanted the relic for his world domination scheme, of course, and since he and Carnby shared a sordid past, their paths soon crossed as a chase to get the item in question ensued, taking viewers to several locations. Bureau 713, led by Dorff, stepped in to save humanity from Hudgens' plans, and proceeded to engage armies of creatures known as Xenos in several quite impressive battle scenes as part of the overall plot progression.\\n\\nAITD looked and felt like a B movie most of the time, adding to its charm, assuming you're forgivingly inclined. Sure, the CGI wasn't up to major release standards, but such minor niggles became easy to ignore amid the film's overall enjoyable content and surprisingly absorbing action. Speaking of which, one had to note a significant amount of attention to detail went into crafting these combat elements, with good set and costume design.\\n\\nTowards the end things began to fall apart, sadly, and by minute 90 it had all reached a hasty and laughable conclusion, but even so, this one had that unique, shamelessly straight-to-video vibe, the one you perhaps remember longingly from defunct Dolf Lundgren releases and others featured on The Movie Channel's midweek late night schedule.

DO NOT WATCH THIS HUNK OF CRAP!!!!!\\n\\nWhen I first heard about this film being made I was looking forward to it. I'd just played Alone In the Dark: A New Nightmare and was hyped up at seeing a film of it. And when I bought I immediately wanted to return it. It stays true to the games just as much a cigarette stays true to your health. Only the characters are what is similar. There's no spooky house on a remote island, instead we're in a city. We have a paranormal agency which doesn't exist in the games and the list just keeps going on an on. This director couldn't direct his way through a car wash let alone this film. The continuity, editing, music and general story were all done badly.\\n\\nIf a game/movie needed to be burned.

      "|This ol' movie really ties the collection together. : Jeff Bridges is perfect as Jeff Lebowski, a.k.a. The Dude; he's an ageing, amiable slacker who doesn't do much with his time besides bowl. When he's mistaken for a rich man (David Huddleston) with the same name, he's hired by the rich man to deliver a ransom. Things go from bad to worse in a hurry, in large part because The Dude frequently involves his loud, abrasive buddy Walter (John Goodman), a crazed Vietnam vet, in his actions.\\n\\nIn terms of the overall Coen brothers filmography, this is relatively minor stuff. It goes on a little too long, and wasn't always terribly funny to this viewer. It also feels self-indulgent at times. And yet, Joel and Ethan here craft a twist-laden, elaborate story that does have some good moments, as well as a highly profane script and an eclectic soundtrack. (The Dude hates The Eagles, but is a big fan of CCR.) Its quotes certainly entered the public consciousness in a big way, with Bridges quickly becoming a pop culture icon in his role. \"Well, you know, that's just like your opinion, man.\"\\n\\nThe main reason it worked to any degree (at least for this viewer) was because of its impressive and well-chosen cast: Sam Elliott (as a friendly narrator), Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi (as in \"Shut the *beep* up, Donny!\"), Philip Seymour Hoffman, Tara Reid, Peter Stormare, David Thewlis, Flea, Ben Gazzara, Jon Polito, etc. John Turturro is such a hoot as a bowler named Jesus that it's too bad that his screen time is so limited.\\n\\n\"The Big Lebowski\" is a truly character-driven comedy that does wrap up in a typically amusing way, and it shows that its main character can't just be dismissed as a non-thinking deadbeat; he knows when he's been used. It gave this viewer a conclusion that earned an honest smile, as Elliott breaks the fourth wall and comments on the nature of the yarn with which he's regaled us.\\n\\nSeven out of 10.|\n",

      "|wow  i saw this in the theater with my girlfriend because she had seen it with some friends and said it was so good i made it through the whole thing somehow and as we were walking through the parking lot i just started thinking that this movie has sucked over  hours of life from me and ill never get it back i honestly felt dumber for watching the whole thing there is nothing good about this movie except a couple of members of the cast not travolta nor thurman and their ability was limited due to the awful script there is nothing groundbreaking about this movie the dialog is boring the characters have no depth it seems like it was made on a  hour deadline and they had plenty of spare time to go back and add an f word anywhere there was a space i wouldnt have cared less if tarantino had had another character that built an atomic bomb that accidentally detonated and wiped out everyone in this collection of trash this is by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen especially for something so highly praised                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |Negative |\n",

      "|  im too young for having seen the tvseries that the film was based on and therefore i unfortunately cant compare them anyhow the movie is typical for hollywood today you take a script based on a popular event add some big actors and then you have a movie that has to become a blockbuster or is it really that simple as everyone knows the avengers wasnt a success in the theaters which is good but at the same time very sad good because the audience obviously doesnt watch any movie that has a great budget but bad because of that there are some great things about the movie first of all the script was funny but since the film was cut down theres not a lot left of it the parts that were left though were adequate the cinematography by roger pratt is beautiful and both the production design and the costume design was dazzling the actors do a good job and deliver their oneliners with good timing sure this movie isnt one of the best actionadventures that ive seen but works out quite well on a sunday afternoon too bad is only the bitter aftertaste that they could have made a much better film with the resources that they had\\n\\nrating |Neutral  |2.0       |\n",
