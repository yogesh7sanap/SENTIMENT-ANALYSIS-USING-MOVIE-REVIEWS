        "review_detailed_main": "Many people look back at the films of James Cameron and suggest that the smaller, the budget, the tighter the limitations, the better the end product. Films like Avatar, Titanic and True Lies had huge budgets and drew in even bigger box office but many still yearn for the Cameron that gave us The Terminator and Aliens which were huge movies but packed a far bigger punch artistically. My feelings all these years on are that Cameron has earned the right to make those huge movies but i have to admit to preferring his earlier body of work. The Terminator is a nightmarish, time travelling science fiction film told at a breakneck pace and delivered with confidence and style. The film has a very gritty, underground look to it and does a great job of telling its story amid the frenetic action. There is also a huge slice of horror and suspense thrown in, an impression that has diminished in the years since it's release due to inferior sequels. Viewed as a standalone piece however, The Terminator is fine piece of work from a director with a very clear vision.Everyone knows that The Terminator is the film that gave us Arnold Schwarzenegger but when i look back at the film, it has heart and its the Michael Biehn character, Kyle Reese, that provides it Artistically speaking,Cameron might be well advised that less is more."

        "review_detailed_main": "Is there a better person to play a cyborg than Arnold? For this movie he was a massively built oak tree of a man. His strange accent makes for a perfect callous robotic sounding killing machine. It's almost like his voice is a computer read out ( which I guess it is in one sense ). Terminator is one of those films that started something huge. People didn't realize it at the time, but the careers of Arnold, Cameron and perhaps even guys like Micahel Biehn, Lance Henriksen and even Bill Paxton were substantially started because of this film. And Cameron must have liked working with them so much that he gave all of them substantial roles in his next film ( Aliens ).\n\nAs we all know what the story is, I'll just tell you a bit about what is so fascinating about it. First I have to mention Michael Biehn. He has the real starring role. He is the character that has to explain everything to the audience. He has to explain this complicated story so that we know what is happening and why. It is not an easy job to do something like that and still come off looking all right. But Biehn is simply awesome in this film. A microcosm of his performance can be seen when Sara bites him. Biehn ( Kyle Reese ) replies \" Terminator's don't feel pain. I do. Don't do that again. \" That is such a great line delivered with the perfect expression, the perfect tone and the perfect timing. Biehn is perfect for the role.\n\nThis is also the first film that I saw as a youngster that ever warned me of the dangers of nuclear war and of the rapid advancements of machinery. Perhaps I was too young and naive to fully understand all that James Cameron was trying to say, but now that I am older, I can honestly say that the two Terminators are perfect anti nuke films. And they are so passionate with what they have to say. I like it when a film has something to say. I enjoy being entertained in the process but if you can manage both then you have a masterpiece. This is a masterpiece.\n\nFinally. there are two other reasons to enjoy this film. One, this is the first film where \"I'll be back\" was spoken. Now it is part of Arnolds vernacular. Secondly, Bill Paxton is in it. And he adds spark to any film that he's in. Especially here, as the idiot punk leader that really gets the hell beat out of him, he has some great lines.\n\nA great film."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Terminator (1984) is a masterpiece, the best sci-fi action classics horror movie that started all the Terminator movies. This is Schwarzenegger's best movie and my personal favorite action film. I love this film to death it is my childhood film I grew up with it. Arnold Schwarzenegger was The Terminator T-800 Model 101 indestructible killing machine cyborg. This movie is brilliant, it has brilliant story, brilliant plot, excellent additional cast, brilliant director and writers, good special effects, it is mixed with sci-fi, action and horror. This movie deals with the war that was set in the future but the battle will be fought in the present. It deals with paradox travel trough time.\n\n\"It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop... ever, until you are dead! \"\n\nThis is the perfect action film of all time and still even today over 30 years it is a cult classic. The plot and the script provides excellent dialogues. Why it is brilliant? Imagine someone did something in the future and didn't know about it and becomes a primal target for extermination from a killer cyborg from the future now in the present. That is brilliant and excellent idea and story.\n\nTwo naked men appear in different locations in los Angeles trough flash blue light and electricity they were both set in time from the year 2029 to the present year 1984. One is a human the other is an indestructible cyborg reprogramed to find and kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) the woman whose unborn son will become humanity's only hope in the future war against the machines. The other men is a human being a soldier from the future who has to find Sarah Connor and protect her at all cost. That's the basically plot for this film.\n\nJames Cameron writes and directs this film with his than wife Gale Anne Hurd who also produced this film and they both does that brilliantly. The script with the story provides a perfect action entertainment trough whole film.\n\nBrad Fiedel does a wonderful music theme for The Terminator character and action sequences, car chases and does a drama in which Sarah and Kyle have sex together in the motel room. That's how John was later in the sequel born. Great music score for the film. I love the soundtracks from this film: Photoplay and Burnin' in the Third Degree by Tryanglz.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger was at the top of his career. This movie bring his career at top of the action stars. Arnold is excellent and he performs excellent and acts brilliant as The Terminator. At one time his agent pursued Schwarzenegger to play the action hero, but Schwarzenegger wasn't interested to be an action hero he was interested to be The Terminator and he played brilliantly well and believable enough.\n\nBefore Sarah Connor was a tough bad-ass gun guerilla squad in the sequels, here she was a scared victim. A beautiful young woman who was a waitress at the diner and was just a human being leaving a teenage normal life in Los Angeles. Linda Hamilton is the only Sarah Connor no else can replace her. She is beautiful and smart and it is my favorite Linda Hamilton movie. She acts very realistic, brilliant and perfectly as the scared victim. Linda Hamilton is the best of the film.\n\nMichael Biehn is the only Sgt. Kyle Reese no one else is or can replace him. He is excellent and brilliant I still prefer Corporal Dwayne Hicks but Kyle Reese is my favorite character from Michael Biehn he is a perfect action hero. I love Kyle Reese because he doesn't kill any human being.\n\nLance Henriksen from Aliens and Hard Target is in here and he plays Detective Hal Vukovich and he is very good and realistic as the detective.\n\nPaul Winfield is Lieutenant Ed Traxler first he doesn't believe Kyle Reese story but later he witness it him self. I wish there wouldn't be deleted scene in which Kyle and Sarah finds Traxler dying and he gives Kyle a gun.\n\nThis movie has ton's of action: You see a lot of automatic weapons, shotguns and handguns used in this film and they are used well. You have a car chase between The Terminator and Kyle Reese with Sarah and both men are shooting at each other. Terminator has a stolen Police car and Kyle fires his shotgun and hits twice the Terminator once in the eye. The Terminator than crashes with the car in the wall. In the next scene you see Terminator's eye bloody. You have a great car chase by the end of the film Terminator with truck tries to kill Sarah but Kyle put's a pipe bomb in the truck and you see a huge explosion the truck explodes great special effect. Terminator shoot's with an IMI Uzi in Tech Noir night club. Killing bunch of people in which Kyle stops him with a shotgun. Terminator crash with the car in the police station and kills almost 19 cops.\n\nWhen we see The Terminator been all burned out without flesh with only been endoskeleton covered with steel with his red eyes glowing that is scary when he chases Sarah is scary when I was 6 years old I screamed when I saw that skeleton cyborg attacking Kyle and Sarah.\n\nThe Terminator is a 1984 American science-fiction action film directed by James Cameron.\n\n10/10 Bad-Ass Seal Of Approval The Terminator is a masterpiece a science fiction action horror film, a film I love to death and it is my personal favorite Schwarzenegger film. This is Schwarzenegger's best film with Predator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day I highly recommend those three films."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Terminator, created after another one of James Cameron's reaccuring dreams (Abyss was another one.) A true beginning in sci-fi movies. As Schwarzenegger said to his friend when he was picked to play the part as the Terminator, \"they want me to play as some robot from the future in this weird sci-fi movie.\" His friend said, \"take it.\" Schwarzenegger is perfect as the Terminator, merciless, no fear, no love, no pity, no remorse, no emotions. None could have pulled it off as well as he did. Even his eyes showed no emotion with still showing true evil. Michael Beign is just the opposite. A man sent from the future to stop this machine. He plays his part as perfect as Schwarzenegger plays his. A perfect cast of characters for an all star movie! Plenty of action, story line, plot, character interaction, love story, and romance. Everything is tied into this movie that possibly could be, making it a 3 star movie. Only drawback is it's a little dragged out at parts and gets slightly boring from time to time but it's so minor that one would have to think about it to care. A truly awesome movie."

The effects, from 1984, are still good even by today's standards.\n\nThe plot is not bad either. Unlike most of James Cameron's movies, which are purely style over substance (yes, I'm thinking of Titanic and Avatar in particular), this movie has a decent plot. Not entirely watertight, but it exists and is reasonably coherent and plausible and not merely a medium for linking action scenes.\n\nThough he had done the two Conan movies before this, it is this movie that made Arnold Schwarzenegger a star. Not there for his acting abilities, or linguistic skill, he was every bit the action figure (not quite action hero...).\n\nLinda Hamilton was solid in her role (though her hair style shows this movie was made in the 80s...). Michael Biehn was OK, though sometimes came off as too over-the-top in his performance."

        "review_detailed_main": "Candid admission time: despite selling myself as a fan of action cinema there are two classic genre films I've neglected my whole life. Predator is one, and The Terminator is another. Recently because of this blog I decided to watch both in the hopes of giving a fresh review from a new perspective. Alas, I couldn't finish Predator. I didn't think it was particularly entertaining in the action department, I cared little for the characters, the Predator itself was threatening but not enough for me to be glued. I considered it more a slasher film with buff men in lieu of stupid teens.\n\nThe Terminator falls into the same boat in a way. It's a horror film more so than action, a kind of slasher/chase movie where we follow our heroes in their escape from the monster. Unlike Predator which hides the creature from us, The Terminator focuses on the cyborg hit-man and makes sure we know what he looks like and how daunting he can be.\n\nSarah Connor is a waitress in Los Angeles when her life is shattered by the appearance of two men from the future, one a resistance fighter, another a Terminator, a cybernetic organism. The future is bleak with nuclear holocaust caused by the rise of the machines sending humans underground. With the machines ruling, a resistance fighter named John Connor has become a hero, throwing a monkey wrench into the inorganic creatures plans. Facing defeat thanks to this man, the machines send a Terminator into the past to eliminate Connor's mother and reset the timeline. Somehow one of the resistance managed to go through as well to protect Sarah Connor.\n\nDespite the futuristic ideas and plot the movie itself is very light science fiction and operates more in the horror genre. Sarah Connor is completely unprepared for what she is about to face and Arnie's Terminator is like Friday the 13ths Jason, an unstoppable brute who is seemingly unkillable. It makes for some compelling sequences of destructive action, the Terminator shooting up a police station being a particular highlight.\n\nAs this is a site dedicated to action critique, I'd be remiss not to mention the editing making many action sequences quite awkward. The very first series of murders has the Terminator kill a trio of punks. What could have been a quick and effective assault is a jankily edited nightmare that hardly makes sense. As the movie progresses, I found the editing got increasingly better but overall it's another case of overediting ruining the effectiveness of action.\n\nAnother reason I wasn't as enthralled by the action as others is my disdain for what I call \"Industrial Action\". These movies are typically dark, ugly affairs that focus on abandoned places and industrial areas for settings. Cannon Films was a constant perpetrator of making films that felt inorganic purely because of the settings. Cobra is a prime example and even a film like Robocop, which I do quite enjoy, comes across as bland and uninteresting because of the setting. All of these films take place in metropolitan areas but nothing feels lived in or real. Even in Terminator, the chase sequences aren't as compelling as they could be purely because of how staged it all seems. I don't care how late at night it is, there would be a lot more cars on the streets than the movie portrays. It pulls me out of the action.\n\nThe other facets of The Terminator are just as artificial in my eyes. The plot is interesting as a concept but goes nowhere interesting. I'm sure T2 will expand upon the mythology built up in this first outing, but as a stand alone product The Terminator doesn't invest me in the film's world. The stakes feel nonexistent because Sarah Connor is so removed from the future war against the machines and there isn't enough of a connection thematically. We see the war and its effects, but they aren't tied into the events of 1984 enough.\n\nWhat ties the past and future together is Kyle, the resistance fighter protecting Sarah. The problem here is that Kyle is a weak character and the romance that buds between himself and Sarah is poorly executed and extremely two-dimensional. Sarah, for her part, has some character development but she doesn't exactly feel well-rounded and isn't interesting either. When the artificial killing machine antagonist is the most compelling character in your film, you're missing the point.\n\nI don't have a lot to say about The Terminator because I didn't feel it provided me with anything to really talk about. And that's the sign, to me, of an average film. I don't think The Terminator is bad but I do think it's two-dimensional and lacking in a lot of departments. I mentioned with Speed that you can turn your brain off and enjoy it. That was a fast paced, dumb action movie though. This is trying to have a little more gravitas and meat on the bones and I really do not think it works."

        "review_title": "The wonderful action movie which started a wonderful action saga",
        "review_detailed_main": "The Terminator is one of the best action movies of all time in my opinion. It doesn't set a single foot wrong and it also kicked off a wonderful saga. Without this, there would be no Terminator 2. Think about that. As such, this movie is fondly remembered by many people and it has been the subject of many quotes and spoofs over the years. Why doesn't it set a foot wrong? It is thrilling, almost always entertaining and filled with insane explosions, which more or less makes a good action movie. But 'The Terminator' stands head and shoulders above the rest of it's genre, because of it's well thought-out plot, splendid acting and an eerily memorable music score which gives you a reason to watch the credits at the end.\n\nNow to analysing why the plot is so well-thought out. Well, for one thing, the concept of preventing or setting in stone the future by going back in time was one which wasn't really explored in those days. By exploring it, the Terminator was offering something different, something which has inspired films such as Back to the Future (read the plot synopsis for that film, there are a few similarities). The notion of the final battle of a future war being fought in 'our present', not in the future, between one member of opposing sides, in this case a man and a machine, is also an intriguing one and sets the stage for an exciting battle royale.\n\nI'll run down the plot while I'm here. Sarah Connor, a young woman in her 20's, is the protagonist of the film and our two from the future, Kyle Reese and the Terminator, revolve around her. Reese, who is a battle-hardened soldier who has led a hard life in the wasteland which is the future, must protect Sarah, while the Terminator, an unstoppable cyborg, must kill her, in order to kill her unborn son, the leader of the future resistance.\n\nAll of this leads to some thrilling action scenes and insane explosions, topped off by music scores which add to the tension and excitement. The movie purrs into action quickly, but really kicks off at a disco, where Reese and the Terminator have a shootout, resulting in a city-wide drive-by chase involving the police which doesn't really let up until Reese and Sarah are arrested. During the lull in the chase scene, Reese tells Sarah about himself, the Terminator and their general predicament, which is fairly realistic.\n\nThe next action scene is the infamous police station massacre which everyone seems to talk about whenever they discuss this movie. I can understand why, too. The Terminator pretty much kills every cop in his path with the greatest of ease, either with the AK-47, his shotgun, or both. He also ends up cutting the power and setting the station on fire, again adding to the tension and excitement.\n\nThe last action scene which, like the one in T2, is a chase which leads to a final showdown in a building. It is a slight letdown, but it is still an intense scene. I will refrain from spoiling the ending, as this is too good a movie to be spoiled.\n\nAll of the acting fits the bill perfectly. As in T2, there is not a single bad performance to be found. Michael Biehn delivers a remarkably intense performance as Kyle Reese, acting like a typical human would in his situation. He displays his range of emotions at the right times, from passionate to worried to unyielding. It is a wonder that his only other major movie is 'Aliens' and that he is starring in stuff like 'Clockstoppers' these days. Linda Hamilton again does well as Sarah Connor, displaying an innocent woman who shows over the course of the film why she is John Connor's mother, displaying previously unheralded steel at the crunch. The support cast isn't too bad either (Dr. Silberman makes his first appearance). But again, the best performance in the film belongs to the bad guy, in this case, Arnold Schwarzenegger. He acts like a killing machine should; incredibly cold, sterile, soulless and unyielding. His facial expression never changes throughout the film and his physical appearance makes him slightly more imposing and intimidating than the Liquid Terminator. He also commences his famous one-liners which have been the subject of many a spoof, including (no, especially) \"I'll be back.\" This is undoubtedly his best performance, even though it is not his only good one.\n\nI will compliment all involved on making a movie which still manages to look good despite having a low budget. I've seen pretty bad-looking movies with fairly high budgets (read: Scooby-Doo), but never good-looking movies with low budgets.\n\nIn the end, The Terminator is a masterful action movie which laid the groundwork for the equally brilliant Terminator 2. If you asked me whether I preferred The Terminator or T2, I would say T2 because I am more familiar with it, otherwise, these two would be on a level footing. If you haven't seen this movie and are an action movie fan, then see it immediately. You won't be disappointed. Trust me.\n\n5/5 stars"

Second the choice of Schwarzenegger is inspired. He is the perfect terminator. Third the intensity doesn't relent. It is a sci-fi horror that doesn't let go.

Now to talk of it as great film, to compare it with American Beauty might seem idiotic--it's an almost unrelentingly dark, violent, frightening action movie, after all--but strip away the relentless action, strip away the technophobia, strip away the blatant dislike of cops and modern youth, strip away the poignant love story and, at its core, it's about an immature, essentially mindless girl becoming a strong, determined woman. That's a theme more movies should have if we want girls to have strong role models.\n\nIn the course of a few hours during which Sarah Connor realises that she is running for her life from a soul-less machine in human flesh that is implacably and violently determined to kill her, she transforms from a girl who can't balance her cheque book to a woman who can order a wounded, beaten man to \"get on your feet, soldier.\" She is clear-headed, not panicky, focused in crisis and incredibly courageous. And it's not that she has lost her essential femaleness but that she's grown up.\n\nIt's relentless, heartless violence appals and fascinates me. It's gritty depiction of our society as a prelude to an even more horrific one in 2023 darkens my heart. It's quickly developing love story touches me. Its humor makes the dark places in me smile. But most of all I am touched and fascinated by Sarah's precipitous transformation. As a good life exercise, ask yourself this: Would you have the courage to do what she does?\n\n9.5 out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Terminator is an extremely low budget movie. In fact, just about everything used in it didn't cost much at all, but it is a very effective movie. Back in the '70's and 80's, movies could be very low budget, but still be great(think of John Carpenter's Halloween).\n\nThe Terminator is a story about how nuclear war causes the end to mankind and the end result could be the start of an even greater tragedy than the war its self. The entire message of The Terminator is an anti nuclear war message.\n\nMany people think that a few parts in the beginning of the movie are just some random things thrown in. I can understand why, but these seemingly random scenes actually do have a lot to do with the story.\n\nArnold does a great job as the cyborg who is programmed to kill without mercy or remorse. For those who don't know, this is the movie where the line \"I'll be back\" was spoken. The other actors do a good job in this. Linda Hamilton made a great choice doing this movie and she really improved her career through it(the movie she made before this was the horrible Children Of The Corn).\n\nThis is better than Terminator 2(which is still great by the way), because this movie has more of a story and is more involved. I would recommend watching this movie at any time, it is very well paced and never gets boring, and if you have the time, watch T2 right after this."

        "review_detailed_main": "Note: My first time watching this film was in 2019.\n\nTaking off the rose colored glasses, this would be a B-list action flick that would be quickly forgotten if it were released today. It brought a new level of thought into blockbuster action flicks, but there have been successors that use time travel in an action movie much more effectively. Also, the premise was well thought out with few plot holes, but it was always explained in a way that seemed to highlight a lull in the action rather than build tension for the next scene. The acting was very minimal and forgettable, reminiscent of acting in B-list action films today.\n\nSaving the most obvious for last, the effects were very dated. The computer generated effects have aged the worst. The clothes and hairstyles are a close second, but they can be forgiven as accurate for the 80s. However, the future costumes can't be forgiven. Everyone literally wearing burlap sacks with faces covered in dirt is both cliched and unrealistic.\n\nFinally, the music screamed 80s, not only in style, but also with the disconnect between the score and what's happening on the screen. Movie scores have been one of the slowest film aspects to consistently make progress, and this film is a good example of the inconsistency that remained in the 80s. It's just becoming common to see scores written to evoke emotion for the film's specific scenes, but movies like The Terminator still miss the mark by under- or overplaying the emotion in the scene.\n\nAll-in-all, it seems like it has all the makings to be an 80s classic, and I can see why it became as popular as it is today. Although I can also see that if it were released today, it would not be nearly as innovative or memorable, and I can certainly see why young Arnold thought this movie wouldn't amount to anything. Perhaps that is why the Terminator reboot series has been performing poorly in the box office."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've reviewed this classic movie before, but now I'm gonna review the DVD. To start, I must say that although they had their rationale for deleting the \"terminated\" scenes, as they were called, I think they definitely should have left that one scene in where Sarah Connor calls her mom and tells her to hide in the cabin, and where she finds the listing of Cyberdyne Corp. in the phone book. This scene established Sarah as one who is willing to try to take matters into her hands to stop a nuclear war and a horrible future. She talks to Reese about getting rid of Cyberdyne and they get into an arguement about whether or not that is a mission objective and Reese ends up chasing Sarah into a wooded area. I think the beauty of the woods, flowers and waterfalls was important too, because Reese starts crying and saying how all of this is destroyed, and the future is nothing but blackened, charred ruins littered with the skulls of attempted human genocide. What a terrific, powerful scene. I adore Michael Biehn, and I didn't realize what a great actor (and crier) he is!!! Maybe the other \"terminated\" scenes were okay to delete, although they were all delightful. The one where Sarah practices her \"wholesome waitress\" routine was cute. The one where she talks about Disneyland and hot dogs might have seemed silly, but it really brought home how foreign our world is to Reese, as did the crying scene. The tickling scene might have seemed silly to the editor, but I thought it really made a point: after all the violence and bleakness Reese lived through, to be with the woman he's always loved and idolized, to lay in a cozy warm bed with her experiencing the simple joys of life for the first time (I still wonder if Sarah devirginized him, since he said he'd \"never\" had any special someone in his life) seemed to bring everything into perspective. The scene where you discover that the factory was Cyberdyne Systems was important too, but I'll let these scenes slide. I really think they should consider releasing a TERMINATOR with the scene in the wooded area included. Nevertheless, I still consider this film as one of my favorite sci-fi films, and my favorite James Cameron film. I still admire who he infuses humanity with action and adrenaline, and the missing scenes were wonderful."

        "review_detailed_main": "Who would have thought a low budget science fiction movie aptly named The Terminator would become a successful movie as well as start the meteoric rise of Arnold Schwarzenegger as a legend in cinema, introduce director James Cameron to Hollywood as a force to be reckoned with, give a new meaning to audiences with the immortal line \"I'll be back\", spawn a large fan base, and then witness the birth of a big-budget saga with an even bigger sequel in 1991 that outdoes the first movie with Terminator 2: Judgement Day and then continue on with Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines in 2003, Terminator Salvation in 2009, and Terminator Genisys in 2015 as well as a short lived TV series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger introduces us to his now iconic role as The Terminator, a cyborg disguised as a human being. The Terminator has been sent back in time from 2029 to Los Angeles in 1984 to terminate Sarah Connor in order to prevent the birth of her unborn child, John Connor, who would go on to lead the human resistance to victory against Skynet and the machines in the future following a nuclear war which almost wiped out most of the human race. Arnold Schwarzenegger, in a rare role as a villain, is perfect as the Terminator, a killing machine who is programmed to kill without any pity, remorse or fear in his single minded quest to terminate Sarah Connor.\n\nLinda Hamilton in an early role introduces us to Sarah Connor, a timid and mousy waitress who's life will be changed forever upon the discovery her unborn son, John Connor, will become the future leader of the human resistance. She still does not believe that such an event will happen with the nuclear war and the rise of the machines, until her encounter with the Terminator and thus begins her quest to stay alive for the sake of her unborn son and to survive this real life nightmare.\n\nMichael Biehn in one of his early roles plays Kyle Reese, a young, battle-hardened, and world-weary soldier who volunteered to be sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 by John Connor to protect his mother at all costs from the Terminator. Once Reese rescues Sarah, he warns her about the impending doom of the human race from the nuclear war and her future significance carried by her and her unborn son.\n\nKeep an eye out for Bill Paxton in an early role as a street punk.\n\nThough The Terminator is now 30 years old, it still stands the test of time as a positive influence on all science fiction and action movies since. Exciting, high energy action sequences which turns downtown Los Angeles into an urban battleground and leads to an even bigger chase to a climatic showdown keeps the dynamic tension in The Terminator very tight and does not let the audience go for one moment.\n\nTaut and kinetic direction with a sharp eye for attention to detail from James Cameron keeps The Terminator as a gritty, clever, breathtaking, exciting and thrilling movie from beginning to end.\n\nDefinitely one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time.\n\n10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Terminator, directed by James Cameron, is unarguably one of the most well-known sci-fi films of all time. It follows Sarah Connor, your average young woman, that just so happens to be the one who's going to give birth to humanity's leader in the war against the machines. Both sides of the war sent their agents from the future to the present - the Terminator, a deadly cyborg assassin, sent by the machines to kill Sarah. Kyle Reese, a human soldier, sent by humanity to save her. Will they be able to stop the ruthless Terminator and save humanity?\n\nI think this review will be quite short this time, since this is pretty much a nothing movie. By that I mean, I'm pretty close to being indifferent towards it. That being the case, I don't think I have much to say here, but I'll try my best.\n\nMost of this film feels pretty flat, in my opinion. Take the main human characters - they don't have to be deep for me to enjoy them, but I also don't feel like it's a \"simple but effective\" kinda thing. They just are, you know? They don't feel real, just walking clich\u00e9s with some dialogue. Their relationship and chemistry feels forced to me.\n\nOn the other hand, The Terminator itself works pretty well as a character, since he has an iconic concept. Beyond showing just how merciless he is throughout the movie in a decently effective way, this guy is pretty much like a sitcom character - whatever situation you will think about, something will come up when you write the script for this character.\n\nBut yeah, when I look at the film as a whole I just don't feel it goes as hard as some might think. It has some cool action scenes, some memorable moments, a solid concept. The problem is that nothing immerses me, even the best moments got relatively minor reactions out of me. It's not a bad film, but it's nothing I'd come back to, at least for now.\n\nMy previous experience with James Cameron, Aliens, was quite frustrating. That being said, I remember watching The Terminator some years ago and overall enjoying it, so I didn't really know what to expect. I think that my watching experience ended up being very...okay, I guess? I don't love it, I don't hate it. I had an okay time, with some cringe moments and some decent, fun moments, especially those involving the Terminator itself. I think I'm gonna give it a 6.2/10. Hope the next movie in the series is better."

        "review_detailed_main": "The police psychologist interviewing Kyle Reese says it just right at one point: \"I could make a career out of this guy!\" Make that two careers, that of action hero Arnold Schwarzenegger and blockbuster filmmaker James Cameron.\n\nSarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is a struggling waitress who has just been stood up for a date. Another date is en route; unfortunately for her it's the proverbial date from hell. He may look like a studly Austrian-American bodybuilder, but he's really a hyperalloy metal chassis wrapped in human tissue sent from the future to kill her before she can give birth to the hope of mankind's survival. Can Kyle (Michael Biehn) save her before Arnold does his job?\n\nThe title character is really a thing of beauty. As Kyle explains: \"It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear. And it absolutely will not stop. Ever! Until you are dead.\"\n\nSo what you have is \"Jaws\" for a new decade. And there can be no doubt what that decade is. From the Walkman worn by Sarah's roommate to the trendy neon sportswear on display at the \"Technoir\" nightclub, this is a 1980s movie through and through. And other than some clunky miniatures work set in the world Kyle came from, there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nThe film has a lot more going for it. From start to stop this is, like \"Jaws,\" a pop-action spectacular that never stops. Even the lengthy time-travel exposition scenes are suspenseful, because you are always alert for what might come through the door in the next second. Schwarzenegger makes his most lasting impression in an atypical bad- guy role, while Hamilton convinces with her ruffled beauty and sudden bursts of heroism. Biehn may do the best job, his face suggesting the anguish of his character's plight as well as his somewhat crazy hope for the future personified in Sarah.\n\nCameron and producer Gale Anne Hurd fashioned a clever script with many brilliant touches that reward re-viewings. There's a scene between Kyle and Sarah that brings \"Terminator's\" greatness into focus for me. He's telling her of this photograph he has been holding of her, and spent many terrible nights staring at, wondering what she was thinking. Later, Cameron has a scene where we get to see what Sarah was thinking, and it's a doozy!\n\nThen there's the police vehicle the Terminator rides around in trying to get his mark. The slogan on the side of the car reads: \"Dedicated To Serve.\" Perfect!\n\nIs the Terminator supposed to be from THE future, or just \"one possible future\"? Like Sarah says, a guy could go crazy thinking about this. Or at least have to wait until the next sequel. Hollywood can beat good ideas to death, but this film proves it will take a lot indeed to kill the Terminator."

It still surprises me how Jim Cameron and the rest of the production crew managed to pull the special effects off. Anyways, this future sequence is just a preview of the darkness and entertainment this movie is about to bring to the screen.\n\nAs soon as Arnold shows up doing the terminator pose, and uses classic Arnold one-liners to get some clothes from some punk guys, you immediately realize you're in for a ride.\n\nMichael Biehn does a great job playing Kyle Reese, I cannot imagine anyone else playing him. Linda Hamilton does a wonder playing Sarah Connor, and shows how an average woman living a casual life can change into a fight-for-your-life Rambo type gal.\n\nOverall, with stellar acting and directing, an insanely good plot and how-did-they-do-that special effects, this movie gets a 10/10 from me.\n\nOh and also, don't forget, 'I'll be back' - insert Austrian accent."

The bad guy is bad, there's no mercy in there. Like many Cameron films, the dialogue brings out real characters, and the relationship between the Sarah and kyle feels genuine. The way the film unfolds is constantly gripping. The soundtrack really emphasises the desperate struggle.\n\nAnd most of all the whole movie does justice to the plot, and the plot is absolutely watertight. Like the best science fiction films, it leaves you thinking about it, it leaves you agog at the possibility of it, and it doesn't have any holes - the downfall of Terminator 2 in my opinion, which doesn't make any sense from a plot point of view given Terminator.\n\n10 out of 10 - the effects may date but they don't make a movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "Here I sit watching the original movie and realized I have never reviewed it. I will cut to the point: This is the ONLY movie that is needed and every other movie in the franchise is completely superfluous. T2 had the makings of being a perfect sequel, but truth be told, it is no where near the movie the first one is.\n\nI read somewhere that The Terminator came to Cameron when he had a fever dream. A dream that featured a cyborg that had one mission and would not stop no matter what. This is a truly terrifying aspect and the first movie perfectly conveyed the total terror and helplessness our hunted, Sarah Connor, goes through.\n\nUsually movies that involve time travel can be convoluted but this story, the concept of time travel makes total sense. A cyborg coming back in time to kill the mother of the man who stands up to AI overlords is a pretty simple concept to follow.\n\nWhat makes this movie the best is that it does not rely on CGI to make up for lack of story. Honestly, CGI has ruined the experience of of movies. I am watching the eye removal scene right now. Amazing effects, mood, and shock value that none of the movies came close to reproducing.\n\nThe entire cast was perfect. Arnold was amazing and haunting. All the other Terminator movies, he was annoying. Linda Hamilton played a person whom I believed is real in this movie. In all the others, she's a cartoonish and totally unreal heroine. Everyone else in this movie was absolutely stellar.\n\nTo me this is the only movie I need to see (although, I did like T3, but still, a movie that is not needed) to entertain me and put me into a state of fear and mayhem.\n\nThis is a timeless and perfect movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Based on the writings of science fiction author Harlan Ellison, James Cameron's dark vision of the future was a launching pad for several careers in Hollywood. Arnold Schwarzenegger was at the height of his career and appearance in 1984, so his size and musculature made him the perfect choice to play the killing machine from the future. Linda Hamilton became a star after a somewhat lackluster career by portraying Sarah Connor, a role she reprises in T2: Judgment Day. Micheal Biehn, a heretofore minor character actor, gained overnight popularity as Kyle Reese and went on to film other action films, including Navy Seals and Aliens. Even Lance Henriksen can claim a large amount of his success on his role as Det. Hal Vukovich, and both Bill Paxton and Brian Thompson were seen early in their careers thanks to their brief but memorable roles as the punks who first confront the Terminator.\n\nWhile the special effects were not what we would expect to see now, for 1984 they were exceptional. The mechanical movements of Arnold were timed and precise, and the skeletal movements of the Terminator at the end of the film are matched with his character. There are some disparities in the plot, but those are the normal disparities that come with any time travel story. The action, once we get past the initial introduction of characters, is fast. Even when the action slows, the plot moves forward with a consistency rarely seen in action films, and the on-going development of the characters is well written and acted. Its popularity is apparent, since it has spawned no less that three sequels which manage to cover every question, including how John Conner got the scars across his face. Rated R for sex, language, and violence, older teens will probably not find the solitary scene between Sarah and Kyle too embarrassing, and the younger kids should be in bed. Definitely a collectible for any good collector."

        "review_detailed_main": "$100million or more may have been spent to make the much celebrated sequel, but this, the original, stays longest in my mind, and I suspect a good many other people's too.\n\nFor all the hype about T2, that film simply does not have the narrative drive which is on show here. Fusing the concept of time travel with the theme of assassination, James Cameron's picture has echoes of such classics as Day of the Jackal; the extra twist here of course is that the Terminator would appear to be indestructible. It's as though Steve Austin (TV's Bionic Man) had transformed into Mr Hyde.\n\nBy creating a tightly written thriller, with an almost claustrophobic sense of tension to it, Cameron proved right at the start of his career he does not need a mega budget to make a great film. Indeed, it's significant to note that the two finest pictures of Cameron's career, critically at least, The Terminator and Aliens, are also the two films with the smallest budgets.\n\nT2, Titanic and Avatar have reaped over $4 billion, but hand on heart, can anyone honestly claim those pictures, in regard to writing, direction, and a compelling storyline come anywhere close to the tension and sense of drama which he manages to evoke here in less than a couple of hours? I seriously doubt it."

        "review_detailed_main": "It was funny to read that this film nearly avoided coming to our screens. With many number of studios rejecting the script and story, Terminator was nearly terminated before getting of the ground. However, one company, ORION pictures, the last resort for this movie, loved the premise of a robot running around as a man, trying to kill the mother of the savior of planet earth. Thank goodness they saw that it was a good script, because it become one of the great films of the 1980's.\n\nIn 2029, giant super computers dominate the planet, hell bent on exterminating the human race! And to destroy man's future by changing the past they send an indestructible cyborg - a terminator - back in time to kill Sarah Connor, the woman who's unborn son will become mankind's only hope. Can Sarah protect herself from this unstoppable menace to save the life of her unborn child? Or will the human race be extinguished by one mean hunk of mutant metal?\n\nWell this film is a real blast. The cast is extraordinary. This is probably Arnold Schwarzenegger's most popular role. I cannot see why it isn't. He was great as the Cyborg that was walking around, as a killing machine. His facial expressions are sketched in my memory for life. I love the scene where see a close of his face in the police car, it was brilliant. Schwarzenegger, originally a body builder, he has had a wonderful career in the movie industry. His other great films include Predator, End Of Days, Total Recall, Eraser and was impressive in his role as Mr. Freeze in Batman and Robin. His career was on hold for sometime a while back, due to injury, but he is back and I hope we get to see more of his acting talents.\n\nThen you have the others in the cast. The other stand out in this film for me is Linda Hamilton. She was suited perfectly to the role of the feeble Sarah Connor, who is going to be the mother of the child who is going to save the world. Hamilton has had a mixed career, with her filmography including the enjoyable Dante's Peak. The good guy in Terminator was Michael Biehn, who played out the role of Sarah Connor's protector, Reese Kyle. He was very good in his role. His other movies include Aliens, The Rock, Crash and an uncredited role in the great musical, Grease.\n\nThe director of Terminator, namely James Cameron, did a great job with this film. Considering he thought up the idea from a sick bed, had it rejected that many times, it is a great credit to him. Most directors would have given up on it, but he stuck with it till he got to our screens. Thank goodness he did. The story of the Terminator is an interesting one. It has a very biblical feel to it. One man sent to help save the world, with the initials J.C., fascinated me immensely. Cameron and Co writer Gale Anne Hurd did a fantastic script for this film.\n\nThere are some unbelievable scenes in this movie. None more so then the vision we see of the metal Cyborg walking from the truck fire. The vision we see from this scene is one of the main reasons why we have the Terminator. James Cameron explained that he wanted a scene in a movie that has a machine walking from a fire in menacing fashion. He got this spot on, if you ask me. Then there are some other great scenes such as the tense stand offs that the evil cyborg has with all the humans he comes into contact with, including the first confrontation with Sarah, in addition to the meeting he has with Reese. I also enjoyed the scene where he goes through the police station. Of course this scene has one of Hollywood's most famous lines in it, that of Arnie's 'I'll be back', a classic. The final confrontation between Sarah and the Cyborg is another tension filled scene of this great movie.\n\nSo, what more can I say about this movie? It is simply brilliant. I have asked many people their opinion on this film. One such response about it was, that is too 'eightish', and that comment is fair enough. If you have the chance, grab a copy of Terminator on DVD, as it is a great 2 disc set"

        "review_detailed_main": "Prelude: I find the collective average score of movies on IMDb to be really good. Obviously, some reviews are more subjective than others. That's ok, different films appeal to different folks, for many reasons. Also, IMDb movie review averages really illustrate just how 'out of touch' RTs & other reviewers are.\n\nThat said, this is an exception. Why is it that the horror and sci-fi genres (especially); automatically start out with a ratings disadvantage? It's as though their ceiling is 8 or 9 instead of 10. This is true.\n\nAnd the reason is, non-fans of these genres who view these movies, automatically lower the rating because of their aversion to these genres. My wife demonstrates this. In fact when I ask her why she gives \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" a \"3\", she simply states \"Because I loathe horror movies.\" Then when I clarify, \"But Evelyn, compared to other movies like this, how good, how effective was it?; she'll then reply, \"Heck Bob, maybe a 9 or 10! It's really creepy!\"\n\nIt is rarely true the other way around. Fans of SciFi & Horror, typically also love Drama, Suspense, Action, Adventure, Fantasy & Romance genres as well. And hence, there's no blowing up of the rating curve on movies they reviews across those categories.\n\nI saw The Terminator by chance one evening (circa 1985), at home, on what was perhaps the prototype of premium subscriber TV. (I think it was ONTV, but it's so long ago I can't be sure.). And this was a special \"Premiere TV showing\".\n\nI had no idea what the movie was about. Never even heard of it in fact. Nor did I know it was Sci-fi. And the title sounded really dumb to me. Just the same, I decided to watch it.\n\nMy future X-Wife/kids were in bed asleep, and I was by myself. After another long day at work, I opted to prepare myself a rather potent libation; a very strong triple Vodka with easy OJ. I sat down and settled in.\n\nSo, to repeat, I guess I missed previews and nobody had ever mentioned it to me, because I had no idea what to expect. In fact, I had absolutely no expectations.\n\nWell, I was blown away. I was the edge of my recliner throughout (if that's possible.).\n\nAnd discovery of the terminator's true (cyber) identity, (well into the film), is done brilliantly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis movie (along with Aliens for example), are among the most entertaining films EVER made, including movies outside the genre. T1 introduced effects never seen before. It was Cameron's breakthrough, and for good reason. It's legacy alone earns it a 10. I'll say it's an 11.\n\nThx for listening;\n\nBob R."

However, she is the target of a dark killer, who will not stop until she is killed. When he is about to succeed, another man appears, saves her and tells him the truth: the killer is actually a complex machine, sent to the past to kill her before she can give birth to a guerrilla commander who, fifty years from then, will lead the war against machines.\n\nIf it is action that we are looking for, this film takes that expectation seriously: what it offers us is pure and hard action, from start to finish. It's full of normal and welcome elements in films like this: destroyed cars, car chases, police cars, exploding trucks, highway shootings, high-speed cars. Okay, these folks in the Eighties and Nineties don't seem to be able to design an action movie without destroying cars! Nothing against it, but it is something that I found curious. I particularly liked the shooting sequence at the police station, and the ending, at the factory, is just as memorable.\n\nLinda Hamilton is the most interesting actress in the cast. She is a good actress, and shows talent in the scenes where she is allowed to. I say this because the film was not nice to her: the only thing she does most of the time is to be in danger and to look scared and confused. Still, she did it sincerely. Michael Biehn has more time and opportunities to show what is worth, and he too was extremely competent in his work. But it is Arnold Schwarzenegger who takes the rug off them and makes the film iconic. The film is still from that time when he was just a muscle mountain, hard as steel, with a strong, barely disguised, German accent. He couldn't be better, and it's hard to imagine another actor for the role.\n\nJames Cameron ensures an inspired direction. He knew how to guide his team and get the best out of his cast. Being a 1984 film, I was expecting something different, much more dated and looking ugly, as many films of that decade seem to be now. However, I was very impressed: cinematography is beautiful and the film is sharp and excellently filmed; sets and costumes are, of course, a reflection of the time, but that was to be expected. What about visual and special effects? Okay, I'm willing to concede that they seem archaic to our eyes, but here the fault is ours. James Cameron is an effects expert and used the best there was... in 1984. And in fact, considering it's age, special effects will look much more magnificent. Before finishing, a word of praise for the main theme of the soundtrack designed by Brad Fiedel in synthesizer: undoubtedly, one of the most striking soundtracks for action cinema."

D. who's come to present-day Los Angeles to kill a waitress who will eventually give birth to a son and future warrior. The Terminator is an expressionless villain--perfect casting for Schwarzenegger--so it's easy to see why this role reinvented the former bodybuilder's movie career. Linda Hamilton is also terrific as his target, but this is basically a cheapjack thriller, and one with a tacky sci-fi frame. Director James Cameron stages a shoot-out and a freeway chase with aplomb, but he knows nothing of subtlety and his attempts at humor are heavy-handed. Followed by \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" in 1991, wherein Arnold was improbably cast as the good guy (though audiences didn't seem to mind). ** from ****"

        "review_detailed_main": "More than 30 years has passed since \"The Terminator\" has been released. Wow, how time flies by... Still, the movie remains one of the most fascinating pieces of cinema history. It may show its age in some parts, where it's \"so 80's\" and goofy you'll probably have to giggle or roll your eyes and Arnold delivers his few lines with an accent thicker than pudding, but beside these minor scenes, it has aged well and truly reminds me that they don't make them like that anymore. And if you haven't seen it - what are you waiting for? Stop reading anything about it, go grab yourself a copy, turn the lights down and the sound up and enjoy this visionary masterpiece.\n\nWhy do I say is it visionary? Because there hasn't quite been anything like it before, not at this level of production. Just the idea that a near indestructible cyborg is haunting you for seemingly no reason is nightmare inducing, fundamentally great movie material. Not only that, but how James Cameron is expanding on it is sheer brilliance. Of course, since it involves sci-fi babble which you may or may not find far-fetched there is a slight chance you'll find it's plot to be nonsense. Regardless even if you dismiss the story as something completely stupid there is still plenty of impressive action, stunt-work, car chase-thrills and tension to keep you entertained. But it's far from being just mindless action. It is dark, it doesn't scare away to show some nasty stuff such as the Terminator repairing himself with this flesh torn or him going on a spree at the police station all of which cleverly emphasizes what an unstoppable, ruthless force we're dealing here with. Speaking of the scene at the police station, it is probably one of the most spectacular shootout scenes ever. The non-stop sounds of gunfire, smart use of POV shots which at the time were something creative and not overused, clear camera angles and uncompromised outcome make it something truly special. And Arnolds performance in it is pure badassery.\n\nThe Terminator is one of those must-see movies. Even now where it's formula has already been copied countless times, I still can't appreciate it enough. It is a product of one of the greatest filmmaker of our time, which earned its success by pure passion for the material, imagination and vision, and it shows. Truly a masterpiece."

Cast him as an emotionless, ruthless cyborg who only wants to kill.\n\nLow budget and limited scale? Shoot action scenes at night and utilise a wide range of sometimes limited but always creative effects for those set pieces.\n\nStory about the fate of humanity, and the world being wiped out by machines made on said low budget? Tell a smaller story with a small cast, and provide an insight into that bigger story with a few short flash forwards and through dialogue.\n\nThe execution isn't always perfect, but it's usually pretty great, and the first Terminator does wonders with what it had to work with, and Cameron's screenplay is strong and doesn't waste a second. My score for this would float somewhere between a 4 and a 4.5, but I'm rounding down because I'm an asshole.\n\nFrom memory I do slightly prefer Terminator 2, so I look forward to also rewatching that soon."

The Terminator however is like Die Hard, a thrilling well-made film that succeeds as an action film and a film in general, and treats its audience and genre with respect. It is also one of director James Cameron's best films along with Terminator 2 and Aliens.\n\nThe Terminator looks great still, sure the special effects have not held up as well as the rest of the film but they are not that bad. The film is beautifully and slickly photographed and the sets and lighting are so imaginative and wonderfully nightmarish that one really does get sucked and immersed into its world., and filled with sharp details. Cameron's direction is superb, some of the best of his whole career. The music score is hauntingly eerie and its synthesised sound doesn't date the film at all, instead adding hugely to the atmosphere. The script (including the famous 'I'll be back') is snappy and smart with plenty of wittily written lines, the story is incredibly engrossing and exciting to the maximum with plenty of suspense and fun.\n\nAction fans are guaranteed too to be thrilled by the action here, being both dynamic and thrilling, the climax really does jangle the nerves. Michael Biehn and especially Linda Hamilton shine in their roles, and Arnold Schwarzenegger has never been more perfectly cast as his most iconic character to date. All in all, a brilliant film and one of the greats of the action genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

Because, first and foremost, this stuff is thoroughly rich in meaning. In essence, it's a superbly told tale of a lone warrior on a doomed mission who is given only a fleeting moment to share with the only one of his life. While desperately trying to protect her and everything human in human beings from forces so overwhelmingly destructive that they seem to be on par with the will of the gods in Greek tragedies. And the powerful background, permeated with a sense of impending fate, against which this drama is unfolding, apart from helping to deliver a serious and convincing message, somewhat unexpectedly turns it into one of the most poignant and poetic love stories \u2013 where love conquers time and space and the moment becomes eternal. So this picture should be named among very few actually substantial and emotional fables produced by the department of mainstream entertainment \u2013 as it sets off on an infinite journey far beyond the confines of a genre \u0085 and beyond the infinite."

Hamilton, meanwhile, also was different, with a shapely figure and a fairly nice person, unlike the ultra-thin and coarse woman she was in the first sequel.\n\nPlayed mostly for violence and special effects, the film is a bit rough and sleazy in parts but certainly was popular because, like most of Arnold's film, it flat-out entertains."

        "review_detailed_main": "The sci-fi classic *The Terminator* directed by James Cameron is not merely a film; it's an electrifying experience that transcends the boundaries of its genre and etches itself into the annals of cinematic history. A perfect concoction of relentless action, groundbreaking visual effects, and a thought-provoking narrative, this film introduced audiences to a dystopian future where technology surpasses its creators, making it a prescient cautionary tale.\n\nAt its core, *The Terminator* revolves around a relentless cyborg assassin, sent from the future to eliminate Sarah Connor, the unsuspecting mother of humanity's savior. Arnold Schwarzenegger's portrayal of the titular character is iconic, perfectly embodying a chilling blend of invulnerability and terrifying precision. His utterance of few yet memorable lines has since become part of pop culture lexicon.\n\nWhat truly sets *The Terminator* apart is its masterful pacing and tension-building, expertly crafted by Cameron's direction. The film operates like a relentless machine, driving forward with an urgency that mirrors its own narrative. Every action sequence is meticulously choreographed, yet feels raw and chaotic-drawing the viewer into a visceral experience where stakes are ever high.\n\nMoreover, the film's themes of fate versus free will resonate even deeper today. The concept of a future dictated by technology prompts audiences to reflect on the implications of our own reliance on machines-a discussion that feels increasingly relevant in an age of AI and automation.\n\nThe supporting performances, especially Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, play an indispensable role in elevating the film. Hamilton's character evolves from a na\u00efve waitress to a fierce protector, symbolizing empowerment and resilience. Her journey throughout the film not only serves the plot but adds depth to its emotional core.\n\nVisually, *The Terminator* broke new ground for its time. Combining practical effects with innovative techniques, Cameron created a gritty yet compelling world that feels eerily plausible. The film's aesthetic, drenched in neon and shadows, crafts an atmosphere reflective of its cybernetic themes, marking it as a timeless piece that continues to influence filmmakers today.\n\n*The Terminator* is a film that defies the passage of time, leaving an indelible mark on science fiction cinema. Its ability to blend action with profound philosophical questions establishes it not only as a thrilling ride but as a poignant commentary on the human condition in an age of burgeoning technology. A must-watch for any cinephile, it serves as a reminder that sometimes, the most terrifying elements of our future are those we have yet to discover about ourselves."

        "review_title": "Fatality and Predestination or when running away can only be a temporary option",
        "review_detailed_main": "Simply said, \"The Terminator\" is a great film, and even greater when you watch it with the mindset of someone discovering it in 1984, a time when Arnold Schwarzenegger's career was still to be consolidated, when James Cameron wasn't yet that billion-ma'King of the world', when \"I'll be back\" was still a quote that could be heard in any film without being associated to a bad-ass catchphrase with an Austrian accent, when Linda Hamilton still looked like a lovely doll begging for protective hugs.\n\nIn 1984, moviegoers went to see an entertaining B-movie starring that Conan-the-Barbarian-guy whose speech pattern could hardly be taken seriously. Even the producers and director expected a backslash from the critics. Little did they know that they had just made a milestone almost as significant for the Sci-fi genre as \"Alien\" five years before, and that their humility would be rewarded by a close-to-unanimous praise and a lightning propulsion into Pop- Culture. Arnie became THE ultimate action-movie icon, and the rest is no less legendary.\n\nAnd the reason the film works is its remarkable simplicity in each aspect. First of all, the plot : an Artificial Intelligence company named Skynet created such technologically advanced robots that they rebelled against humans and provoked a nuclear holocaust until they were almost defeated by the Rebel Chief John Connor. As a robot sent to kill his mother before he'd exist, Schwarzenegger appears at night, completely naked and takes some civilian clothes before tracking Sarah Connor. But we're in a basic Sci-fi movie and the villain calls for a hero, this is where Michael Biehn intervenes, he looks strong but he's not the alpha male muscular type, which eases the empathy process.\n\nHis mission is to protect Sarah Connor and kill the Terminator, so running away can only be a temporary option. Yet if the villain ever inspires one thing, it is not to confront him. The Terminator doesn't know what Sarah Connor looks like, but that's not an issue, any Sarah Connor can potentially be John's mother and is terminated Skynet-style. The murders are straightforward and chilling. At first, the Police don't notice anything odd with that brutal murder, until a second Sarah Connor is gunned down. What kind of serial killer works by the name? Anyway, the most urgent is to protect any Sarah Connor living in L.A., including an adorable waitress, so far from that girl-power archetype from the sequel.\n\nAnd this is one of the film's beauties, the absolute contrast between the robotic killer and the harmless target. And this is where the casting pays off; Arnold Schwarzenegger was certainly criticized for the limitations of his acting range, especially at a time where his accent was stronger, but here, he's given a role that only an actor like him could have portrayed perfectly: a cold and implacable killing machine. The Terminator was nominated #22 villain in the American Film Institute, but he's not sadistic, nor vicious, he's just programmed that way, which is why he's so scary. He's like a steamroller of brutality that will ignore every obstacle until it gets him to Sarah Connor.\n\nAnd the film wouldn't have worked had Linda Hamilton looked or played it like Ellen Ripley in \"Alien\", Obviously, a woman like Sarah Connor needs a protection whether from the cops or from Biehn, and some bits of luck that will prevent her from the fatal encounter. Indeed, when the Terminator realizes he didn't kill the right woman although she lived in Sarah's house, begins a breathtaking, spellbinding cat-and-mouse chase. There are shootouts, there are car chases, but they felt different because this time, the enemy doesn't try to get at them but to kill them, they're means as well as ends. The Terminator is an unstoppable death warrant, guided by fatality. Notice the scene when, for once, Sarah gets the illusion of being finally protected, in a commissariat. The Terminator's \"I'll be back\", especially when heard for the first time, sums up everything, no matter how far away you try to push him, he'll get back to you.\n\nAnd this, resonates as the voice of fatality, the omen of an inevitable confrontation, something that neither Biehn nor Sarah can't avoid, the future has come to haunt them, and if Sarah is really the mother of a future fighter, even she will have to express that 'fighting' part of herself. Whether you look at the half-empty or half-full glass, you'll see \"Terminator\" as a predestination or fatality movie. And I guess this is why the appellation neo-noir isn't gratuitous. Noir is about people who try to escape from a painful certainty but can only triumph over it by confronting it, at the cost of something precious such as their innocence, their optimism, their faith on life or humanity.\n\nAnd 'The Terminator\" is mostly set at night, it features characters who hide from these robots that remind them the apocalyptic future they carry on their hands, their own responsibility. Of course, bonds ought to be made and we have some clues that the predestination thing will provide some curious loops that don't quite respect the orthodoxy of time travels. But the film isn't about time travels, it's about a sense of duty and responsibility. And in a way \"The Terminator\", as a villain, is an inspiration for the heroes, as much as he must kill them no mater what, they have to resist and to defeat him at any costs, the measure of a great antagonist is the degree to which he allows the heroes to overcome their weaknesses.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the whole trilogy invites humans to question their condition, from being masters to slaves of the technology, what you can control can control you, it's all up to us to take the control of our lives back. That's what Sarah Connor will do, and this is why she becomes such a great heroine, the perfect match for such a great villain."

One of them even seems to want to kill her and ruthlessly kills two other Los Angeles women named Sarah Connor. The movie is pretty well directed with the tone being ominous at the beginning and more exciting as the story moves on. The mystery element is what makes it work in the first half, with us having no idea who these men are and why they are looking for her. There turns out to be an interesting revelation for it and a cool sci-fi paradox at the end. The action scenes are exciting, but it would have been better to have it more science fiction and less action as we only see a small part of the film focusing on the future. The climax is also very exciting and well done. The acting is good but the main character is not very interesting or likable, just your average woman. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays his character perfectly as an unstoppable emotionless freak, which is the strongest part of the movie. This film would be good for sci-fi fans but even more for action fans."

If so, then this has gotta be the best B-Movie in history (and I absolutely love B-Movies) this film is more than any one genre, Sci-Fi, B-Movie, thriller, horror , this film has it all, even some romance thrown in, the point is it's one of the best films of its kind, one of my all time favourites. We get a glimpse of a nightmarish future where machines rule the world and then back in (present day) 1984 LA, two men (one man, one cyborg) are transported onto the LA streets both looking for a carefree young Sarah Connor, one wants to protect her, the other wants to Terminate her so the machines can continue to rule in the future and her unborn son seems to be the key to stopping them, definitely a mouthful of a plot to keep up with, so we have a cat and mouse game going as her would be killer is an unstoppable Cyborg, a T-800.\n\nThe tension is present throughout pretty much the whole film, the film also screams 1980s in the best possible way, the dark brooding neo noir atmosphere, the music, the lighting, the tech-noir nightclub, theirs barely no time to rest, their is tension, drama, action right from the get go to the thrilling climax.\n\nThe cast are fantastic here, Michael Biehn as a young soldier sent to protect Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor, but the real star of the show is Arnie himself, a career defining role in an impressive film career of action packed hits, but none better is he here, a truly terrifying machine who will stop at nothing.\n\nJames Cameron done a brilliant job with this and the direct sequel T2, but for me the original edges it due to the sheer bleakness of the plot, the films set mostly at night and I recommend watching it in the evening believe me it is not the same watching in the daytime. Some critics say as with all films of a certain age that its dated, special effects not good compared to today, etc etc, forget all that and just enjoy the film, immerse yourself fully and pretend your in 1984 and the films just come out. I'm hoping to watch this again soon, as it's such a personal favourite, so get the beers and some food in, and enjoy the ride, an easy 10/10."

I just don't visualize myself watching it on many repeat viewings. Arnold Schwarzenegger's robotic acting is perfect for the role of the terminator. On the other hand, Michael Biehn has no excuse. His performance is completely dull, and I wish James Cameron put more thought into casting the hero. You do want the hero to have SOME inkling of a personality. Linda Hamilton's performance, though rusty at points, is pretty good. It's also nice to see Paul Winfield, who I think I haven't seen since \"Cliffhanger.\" Lance Henriksen is always cool to watch. The storyline is thin and easy-to-follow. It's nice to hear the premiere of Arnie's \"I'll be back\" line. The film didn't send me leaping from my seat, but it's worth a look. Seeing that it has reached pretty high status on the IMDB, I'm sure others have a much higher opinion of the original \"Terminator.\"\n\nMy score: 7 (out of 10)"

Just because the ending was good doesn't mean it's a masterpiece. This film delivers the action you want, some humorous scenes, and some suspenseful scenes.\n\nI liked the acting by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton, while Michael Biehn wasn't in their league. For a 1984 film, this film has a good number of action scenes, probably a good look of the future world and the robots are good looking.\n\nThis villain in the film (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) is one of the famous villains ever and that stands a strong point in the film, along with the story and the acting but it wasn't all that great as a classic but you'll have fun when watching the movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "We really did get some of our greatest action movies out of the 1980's. In that decade, where there was action, there was Arnold. This is probably Arnold Schwarzenegger's most iconic film role, that of the unstoppable Terminator. In this science fiction/thriller milestone, the Terminator is a cyborg sent from the year 2029 to kill the mother of the man who would save mankind from the machines. Its a film nearly everyone has seen, so there isn't a whole lot to say about it. It was a great action flick that launched a successful franchise.\n\nThe special effects are a little dated at this point, but it isn't bad enough to pull you out of the movie. The animatronics and puppets are obvious but cool to watch. While on the topic of \"dated\", it is kind of amusing to see this movie take place surrounded by 80's style (that's some BIG hair). The film is loaded with plenty of action but it does slow down a bit after the first half when the audience is treated to the bulk of the movie's exposition. Linda Hamilton is awesome as Sarah Connor, target for termination, and has good on-screen chemistry with Michael Biehn. The only real weak spot (which isn't even really worth mentioning) in the movie was Bill Paxton in the opening as the leader of a punk gang. As minor as his role is, for some reason, he always makes me cringe. For some reason, he just aggravates me in this movie. Of course, he's only on screen for two minutes and his role means near to nothing, so ignore my rant.\n\nThe movie does have a couple plot holes, but only if you feel like feeding a headache with thoughts of time travel mechanics. Most people don't, so it doesn't matter. The movie is a fun popcorn flick and spawned two sequels. Don't try to make sense of things, sit back, and enjoy nearly two hours of action with 80's flair and some of Arnold's best one-liners!"

Terminator is one for me, so I'll confess this review may come with nostalgic bias.\n\nFirstly, I was not old enough to rent this from the video store in the 80's, but it was the 80's, so the video stores didn't care and let me rent it all the time anyways.\n\nTrust me an under 10 year old seeing this as a 'new' movie, was blown away like a disco dancer in TechNoir.\n\nIt's a good movie, but if it's a first time watch today, you have to put your 'film studies hat' on and think about when it was released and what impact it had to really get the hype.\n\nAt the time it was a very fresh flick, computers were making their clunky baby steps into domestic life and it was the Cold War, so it's techno conspiracy of the future was on point. It spawned the action hero boom, created the 'Arnie brand', took sci-fi into a grittier direction and showed the indie film can look better and do better than the studios.\n\nYes some of the effects are a bit rubbish, yes we didn't really notice that at the time, yes it's pretty bad near the end, but they're watchable and there's still some good stunt work and car smashing going on.\n\nThe plots solid, it's not Marvel or DC it's 1984 so we don't need long drawn out back stories full of emotional drives and triggers, we need Arnie with a gun, a few cops and a couple to chase.\n\nI also like the grittier look this has, (mainly due to its budget I think), this is the neon streets of Los Angeles, with the action weaving between drunks and punks. Some of those side characters seem cheesy today, but again 80's!\n\nOverall I can see how new audiences can judge it by todays effects and productions standards and not like it, (and if you think this has aged bad, watch its rival studio film Runaway, that's a dated shocker), - but for those who can watch older films with dated elements adding to its vibe then they're in for a good watch.\n\nMovies are getting old, you've kinda got start looking at them a bit like art history - this bank rolled T2, with nobody really bankrolling this - give it some credit for spawning something that's lasted decades at least."

Michael Biehn plays an unlikely but well-done hero, with Henriksen, Boen and Winfeld as the unexpected comedic relief that lacked in the sequels. The story suffers from a paradox you could drive a big rig through; the special-effects weren't that far ahead of its time; and the soundtrack may have suited the mood for 1984, but it ended up dating poorly. Schwarzenegger fits the role perfectly. Originally, Henriksen was supposed to play the Terminator. The series continues with the far more impressive \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\".\n\n*** (out of four)"

He carries all of his weapons like extensions of his own arms and remains completely deadpan at all times.\n\nThe acting of the movie is carried by Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton, both of whom do an excellent job of their roles. Hamilton is a sweet but scared young woman on the run from something she doesn't understand. Biehn is a young soldier from a time far from now, with PTSD licking at the edges of his consciousness. The way Reese looks at heavy machines with apprehension is a tiny thing that speaks volumes, as is the non-existent reactions to deaths of his fellow soldiers in present day.\n\nCameron's screenplay is a marvel, full of incredible dialogue and one of the best plot twists in cinema history. Whilst most of the visual effects are quite dated, they far from ruin the movie and the animatronic head of Schwarzenegger is certainly impressive for its time. The way Cameron cuts the movie around R-rated violence and unavailable visual effects (putting sunglasses on, brilliant!) actually contributes to the film's cult thriller status. I don't know why Schwarzenegger was given a posh combover at the start, but it is quickly messed up, and the film's score has lots of impressive horror moments but is probably better suited to this film than the very action-heavy Terminator theme we are used to today."

There are just some moments and spots that I can't give it more than a seven, but I do think it is a good film that every film lover must see."

        "review_detailed_main": "After hearing many times to watch terminator series and seeing good reviews finally saw all the terminator movies over the weekend. Being a big fan of sci-fi genre, must say this movie establishes another incredible sci-fi universe like alien,matrix,etc. even though last 2 movies were disappointing. Even if the effects looked very dated, still its a evergreen classic which will be remembered for a long time. The dreadful and menacing 'Terminator' played stylishly by Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of his career defining roles. It feels like he was destined for the role. The Terminator Theme by Brad Fiedel with the clanging metal matches the character of Terminator perfectly and is one of the best themes of all time alongside likes of Star Wars. James Cameron makes skillful use of low-budget effect with a wonderful story. I admired his work in 'Titanic' and 'Avatar', but now I have realized his best work dates back in the 1980s-90s with the best film being 'Aliens'.\n\nA mysterious looking man with no clothes on emerges out of nowhere in L.A. in 1984, he seems to be hunting a woman named Sarah Connor. Similarly another man also emerges who is also looking for the same woman. As it turns out this latter guy is there to protect the woman from the earlier mysterious guy who isn't actually a man but machine called 'Terminator' whose mission is to kill Sarah. Both are sent from a post-nuclear war future where man and machine are fighting, and the fate of Sarah is very important in the whole premise. Well the film kind of shows that the Discovery of Arnold's character is a Terminator a surprising moment as enough suspense gets built up. But since we are already told in the beginning that in future there man vs machine war, so I wouldn't consider it as spoiler. Also as soon as you have time-travel involved in Sci-fi movies the emergence of some paradox is imminent unless you draw line or stick with assumptions. The whole franchise is affected by it, but I feel its the least in The Terminator.\n\nKeeping aside the time-travel the movie's spotlight is its horrific and suspenseful pursuit of Sarah by Terminator. Machines have no feelings like emotion or fear, thus the ruthless Terminator has become like a horror icon! Also there are scenes of the future earth where the nuclear war destruction and the terror of the machine ravaging the lives of humans.These make of think of the path the human race is headed. Brad Fiedel score makes the atmosphere even more scary. Here we have another blend scifi-horror like the 'Alien' and 'The Thing' only with more action. But what makes Terminator a classic on its own is its characters and story. Both Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn were excellent. Without any doubt Arnold was bad- ass and the best. Also I got to enjoy the famous dialogues like 'I'll be Back' or 'Come with me if you want to live' which have become so iconic that all the terminator sequels use them so as to entertain the fans of this original film. The pacing is slightly slow but suspense keeps you engaged. Overall if you think of time it was released, it is a classic and breakthrough film in its genre. Despite not having great effects and me watching it at a time where sci-fi movies aren't that rare 'The Terminator' entertains a lot. It is because it has great story and splendid characters and acting. The thing many special-effect driven sci-fi movies miss nowadays.\n\nRATING: [4.5/5]"

The only good thing about this movie is the story, and even then it's not that good. Another weird part about this movie is the hero. He's just not good. He acts weird all the time to, and I'd honestly just prefer Arny to be the hero. With as much crap I'm giving this movie, I still enjoyed it, for what it is. But what I'm saying is god is it hard to rewatch it is just terrible, and I don't really recommend it to anyone."

Also, the special effects were mind-blowing during that time. But now, a science fiction movie about a robot from the future emerges. The robot is called The Terminator. The Terminator is a dark and action-packed picture about a killing machine sent back through time to kill a woman who hold the key of the future. The Terminator is played by Arnold Schwarznegger, and he has a frightening performance as the metal cyborg assassin. The woman who holds the key to the future is played by Linda Hamilton. She is the victim of the killer cyborg as she is chased around Los Angeles. But, someone else also came back from the future. A solider named Kyle Reese and he is played by Micheal Biehn. The Terminator has great cinematography and develops a personality for the Terminator. In one scene after being shot in the eye, he pulls his damaged eyeball out of his eye socket and reveals the red vision that he sees. After that, he picks up a pair of glasses. The Terminator is a menacing villain that is unbeatable and destructive. All in all, this movie is a good and great one. There are good performances and great cinematography. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 4 stars"

        "review_detailed_main": "This was one of those early movies that drew me in to the world of Hollywood. Of course, when I first watched it, I didn't have much idea about what went behind the scenes when making this movie. But now that I do, my respect for this movie has grown tremendously given what it was able to accomplish on such a low budget with such a small set of characters making what could have easily been a B-movie in the wrong hands seem like a solid sci-fi story ending with an epic feeling of the things to follow.\n\nThe movie begins with what is possibly one of the coolest title cards for a 1980s flick with Brad Fiedel's iconic Terminator theme playing in the background as the cast is listed in the form of messages displayed from a computer terminal. This is followed by the Terminator and the human making their appearances from the future into our present, gathering clothes and weapons and heading out in their own respective ways in the search for Sarah Connor, a teenage girl part-timing as a waitress upon whose survival rests humanity's future as both she and us learn later. What follows is a cat and mouse game where the human goes all out to protect her and the Terminator is all out to get her and it won't stop, literally right till the end.\n\nWhat separates this movie (and its immediate sequel) from the \"other\" sequels is James Cameron's balancing act who, much like Spielberg, allows the story to take center-stage and drive everything else and has perfect control over the length of sequences, edits, camera cuts and angles. 10 minutes into the movie and you're in, drawn to this world, completely forgetting that the futuristic crafts and landscapes are miniatures with absolutely no chance of being drawn out of this world. While I didn't find the characters to be groundbreaking or as interesting as in other dramas, the plot was extremely well constructed and allowed for some really cool paradoxes that would make for some interesting discussion (would John Conner even exist if he hadn't sent Kyle back in time).\n\nThe effects deserve special mention too. It is incredible how much Stan Winston's crew and Fantasy II were able to achieve at the time. All the futuristic scenes, the sequence with the Terminator treating his injuries, the chase sequences and the entire ambitious final act all work and some of them still hold up three decades later. And Brad Fiedel's theme gives me goosebumps every time I hear it, as if signaling an impending apocalypse.\n\nAll the actors do well in their respective roles, particularly Arnold who shines in a part that seemed almost tailor made to suit his acting capabilities. But it is Cameron who is truly the star of this endeavor, believing in his project and driving it to execution. Thank God for the success of this movie, which gave us many more masterpieces by Cameron. But then, it was entirely deserving of it. A sci-fi tech-noir classic.\n\nOverall Score: 8.0 / 10.0"

Of course, the issue of time travel to the past is always fodder for criticism. Of course, we have the sequels, using computer generated special effects (which are remarkable). I still prefer this first one."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Terminator is a good sci-fi film with some flaws but it does have a compelling story, plenty of action, character development, suspense, great special effects especially for that time, and solid performances by the whole cast. I did prefer T2 and most recently Terminator Salvation over this one but the original is still a good film. Writer/Director James Cameron the man behind films like Titanic, True Lies, Alien 2, and the upcoming Avatar showed a real talent as a filmmaker with this movie which was his second one back then. Cameron is one of the best writer/directors out there and he continues to prove just that with every one of his movies. The cast are great in their roles bringing to life these imaginary characters Cameron created for the film. Arnold Schwarzenegger is fantastic in the title role. He may not have many lines and his screen time is cut a little short near the end well sort of Schwarzenegger still proves to be an effective villain. He was born to play The Terminator a ruthless cyborg from the future that will stop at nothing until it's mission is complete. Michael Biehn is equally impressive as time traveler Kyle Reese from the future. He gets just as much screen time if not a little more than Schwarzenegger and Biehn makes the best of his role as the hero in the movie. He brings an intensity to his performance which makes his believable as a time traveler whose mission is to protect Sarah Connor played by Linda Hamilton. She's also very good in the role of Sarah an ordinary woman who must find the strength within herself to stop the Terminator before he kills her. The rest of the cast are okay in their roles but they're not given much to do and really any screen time to leave an impression. The whole story of the film would take me forever to fully explain so I'm not going to get into it. It's better to just watch the Terminator before knowing too much what the movie is about before any spoilers could ruin the experience. The action is pretty much non-stop making the film move at a steady pace as the main characters are introduced and the chase begins to get to Sarah Connor first. All the crashes, explosions, chases, fights, and narrow escapes are well executed most of them looking very realistic. The special effects are state of the art especially for movies back then considering they didn't have the technology available today. The few flashback sequences with Reese showing a post Judgment Day are just as good. The world is an apocalyptic wasteland overrun by machines bent on annihilating the human race. Despite some flaws with the dialogue occasionally, answered questions, and somewhat rushed love story although it had to happen or else John Connor wouldn't exist, The Terminator is still a solid sci-fi film. It's much better than other ones out there like Ultraviolet, Babylon A.D., or Aeon Flux to name a few no offense. Overall The Terminator is an entertaining sci-fi adventure definitely worth watching with plenty of action, great special effects, thrills, suspense, drama, some humor, a little romance, and terrific performances by the cast."

        "review_detailed_main": "Assassination and murder often makes for a thrilling story as it is, but what if the murderer happens to be a machine from the future? Unstoppable, invincible, unable to feel pain or remorse, unable to deviate from its programming. The terminator is an inherently scary figure, partly because of the traits mentioned above, and also because it comes from a scary future ravaged by nuclear war and a robot apocalypse.\n\nThe first Terminator film delivers its premise impeccably, and does so with an agreeable amount of action. Granted that all the sequels have surpassed this film in terms of action, The Terminator still delivers plenty of thrills as the titular machines brutally hunts down its targets. Most of the movie is comprised of chases: car chases, foot chases, with intermittent shootouts, explosions, and fights. In spite of this, the film drags very little; it's actually quite tight, as it effectively uses the space in between the action to develop the story and characters.\n\nAnd the story is quite sound, partly because of its unique premise, and largely because it's told really well. It makes phenomenal use of flashbacks to reinforce the background and characters of the story. Its focus on the characters is superb, and you really grow to care for them by the film's end. Overall, the film shows great depth and detail to make it stand above and beyond most other sci-fi flicks.\n\nThe film looks great, with excellent photography and editing. A lot of scenes, such as the nightclub scene, leaves a great lasting impact. Acting is great: I love Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn, and Arnold Schwarzenegger in their respective roles. Writing is pretty decent. This production has plenty of good, utilitarian sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is really weird, but very moody and appropriately industrial.\n\nHighly recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Perfect | Film: Very Good)"

A human soldier is sent back in time to protect her. Cue loads of sublime science fiction mayhem. The Terminator is inevitably dated due to the small budget, but it's a great time at the movies. It is a science fiction classic and completely deserves to be, thanks to the interesting story and strong action sequences. While it's a fast paced and snappy movie which hurtles along at breakneck speed, there's a moving relationship in the film and the elements of time travel give the story unexpected depth, which ensure the film certainly does not represent its iconic antagonist. Arnold Schwarzenegger dominates the screen in brilliant badass fashion and while he doesn't have many lines, he delivers them excellently and is an intimidating and threatening villain, although he's still not as cool as R2 D2 and C3PO.\n\nThe brilliantly made action ensures the film crackles with high octane thrills and genuine energy. There are too many chase sequences in the film, but at least they remain fun despite some repetition. It's overall a very well made film and delivers thrill after thrill. The runtime isn't overlong and it's easy to watch and enjoy. Acting is all around good and Sarah Connor, although she really became a cool character in the sequel, isn't your typical damsel in distress. Kyle Reese is also a very good character. In General, The Terminator is an iconic and entertaining movie which has surprising depth and plenty of fun action. It's not the best science fiction film ever and can't help but look slight next to its dream sequel, Terminator 2 Judgement Day, but mostly it's held up pretty well and even though the budget is relatively small the effects and surprisingly convincing. James Cameron's films can leave one cold, but he certainly knows how to turn millions of dollars into ultra cool cinematic art and put butts on seats.\n\n9/10"

Naturally, the surprise is gone, and I think the plot idea is maybe the strongest point to the whole movie. The movie is directed with panache, for sure\u2014the effects, the action, the deliberate lack of depth, the epic glossy wow of it all. But it's not a rich movie, it doesn't have depths, it frankly lacks enough to make a second or third viewing worth the trouble. Unless, of course, you are already invested and committed to it for personal reasons.\n\nThe first shot, very early in the movie, when the naked Schwarzenegger appears crouched in the urban night, is archetypal and terrific. And then he moves and interacts (still naked, though you don't see that) and the comic element is in place. And here we have the movie, both profound to the point of being moved, and kitschy and puerile, too. It's sort of meant to be a accessible and direct, and that makes it a great first viewing. The plot is certainly loaded with big (huge) twists and mind-bending ideas. And we want so much for right to triumph over evil.\n\nYou have to ask eventually about the acting. Maybe we need a stiff automaton in the role of the robotic machine that is known as the \"terminator\" (a cyborg). So the future governor of California is off the hook. But the other main lead, the woman known so well as Sarah Connor, is a so-so actress. No way around the plain approach she has to being a regular girl caught up in the largest story possible. The other time-traveller, a human played by Michael Biehn, is pure nuts and bolts stuff, too. In fact, it's hard to really love any of the performances, except maybe the police chief.\n\nAll of this boils down to a movie that scores very high on concept and on the basic effects. This is what drives it to stardom. But leave it at that. Love it for what it is, plain and simple. James Cameron, the lauded and wealthy director in charge, is no genius here, but is very very able. That's a back-handed compliment, for sure. But lovers of Kubrick or Ridley Scott know what I mean.\n\nA re-alignment of the stars for this one. Over time."

By \"important\" I mean that it started lots of things, which later became very common in cinema itself.\n\nThere isn't anything new that I could write about this picture that was wasn't said hundred times before. Everything in this movie works and clicks on all cylinders. Made only for couple of bucks (in terms of today's sci-fi / \"actionier\" budget, even considering B movies) it stuck in people memories forever. How did maestro J. Cameron achieve that?\n\nHere are the main reasons in my opinion: Original and high concept story; Very good and believable acting by all involved; Great script; Cool action scenes; Terrific pacing; and of course all cudos to all technical stuff, effects, cinematography and so on. The idea was always the driving force behind movie, which is now safe to call masterpiece. J. Cameron proofed his genius with his first movie (first movie I mean \"Terminator\", not flying fish stuff J).\n\nOverall, as you have already saw this picture many times, there is nothing new to say. It's a true classic in every meaning of this word. Even now, 30 years after its release, this small budget B movie sci fi flick from 80's is still managing to attract audiences. If you could check some torrent sites, you would always see this film as one of the most down loadable, whenever you check it, no matter what season is, what movies there are \u2013 it's always among the most popular. It's simply just for one reason \u2013 a true movie entertainment is timeless and ageless."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was astonished when I read how cheap this movie had to be made, back in the eighties; only 6 million dollars were available! There simply was no money at all to make this movie, that went on to become an action classic, (with a few faults...)\n\nTerminator launched Arnie's carreer and rightfully so, because he portrayed the ultimate killing machine in a way that is still nervewrecking and fun to watch to this very day.\n\nDespite the cheap looking (sciencefiction) sets and some cheap looking special effects, there is something truly maniacal AND exciting about this action movie.\n\nThe story: A killing machine from the future (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has come to earth to kill an innocent woman. Why? And can he be stopped?\n\nThis story is as ludicrous as can be, but the execution of the ACTION is fascinating nonetheless, because of the relentless killing spree, with contineous riveting action scenes upon action scenes.\n\nOne big long adrenaline fueled ACTION party! The action photography is excellent!\n\nAny bad? Yes there are some things wrong with this picture:\n\nTerminator 2 is considered to be better by many than this original and they are right, because this original has got quite some corny and cheap moments, which are fortunately absent in the sequel. Terminator 2 does look way much better and has got a more credible portrayal of the characters.\n\nThe TERRIFIC ACTION in this original Terminator made me watch it with pleasure though, BUT besides the fantastic action, the rest of the story is rather corny, cheap looking and outdated...."

        "review_detailed_main": "Good action movies like this are rare. They just don't make them like they used to. But this is one for the ages. You can not create another storyline like this one and get even 1/10 the results.\n\nThe Terminator is a classic and most likely will be even after the \"future\" portrayed in the film. James Cameron has done a great job of creating one of the best movies of all times.\n\nFirst off, there's a perfect cast. Every part seems to have been specially designed for the actor. The Terminator could not have been played by anyone other than Arnold. If the Terminator is played by anyone BESIDES Arnold, then it is not being played correctly. Arnold plays him so coldly but very cool as well (if THAT makes any sense). Michael Biehn plays the fearless, mentally unstable hero, Kyle Reese better than anyone else could have. Linda Hamilton shows her famous \"heroine\" performance here as the young, not-yet-tough Sarah Connor.\n\nCombine great performances with a perfect story and you have one of the best movies ever made. This movie can seem like a slasher at times, but it is far above any slasher.\n\nThis is one movie that everyone should see at least once. 10/10. If you haven't seen this movie, you either don't have the money to see it or you just don't like good movies. (Comment rating going to hell for that one)"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Terminator\" is one of the most popular movies that was made back in the mid-80s, and it has been well-remembered by critics and audiences alike. Everyone has seen this movies and knows it quite well as much as its famous sequel \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day.\" I don't know if I had anything new to say about this movie because everyone already knows well about \"The Terminator\" and why its so darn good about it. This movie was directed by James Cameron who would go on to make the second \"Terminator\" movie along with the second \"Alien\" movie, \"The Abyss,\" \"True Lies,\" \"Titanic,\" and now \"Avatar.\" I know that Cameron considered this movie to be his first film because his previous film \"Piranha II: The Spawning,\" was going to be but some random people of the movie took over and wasn't like the way the Cameron envision it. So he just ignores that movie and considers \"The Terminator\" as his first film because he had more control than he had with the second \"Piranha\" movie. The movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator, which it was his first time to play a villain and he really does a fascinating job to not only he embodied the character, but making it such a memorable role. He is the Terminator. Michael Biehn was also great as Kyle Reese along side with Linda Hamilton as John Connor's mother Sarah. The movie really does go at a really good pace, and it does keep you on the edge of your seat. The music by Brad Fiedel is one of the greatest scores that has ever been heard in this kind of movie with the use of synthesizer, and featuring the famous \"Terminator Theme.\" The special effects in this movie are really good in this movie, especially with the design of the Terminator by the great Stan Winston. The effects are no \"Terminator 2,\" but they are still really good before there was any CGI as what most filmmakers are using by today's special effects. The story is really well told and very effective as the premise goes along without any subplots or any of that mumble jumble. All it is that one is really trying to protect Sarah Connor, while the other to terminate and that is all you need for a story like this. \"The Terminator\" is a classic movie of the 80s that mixes with action, horror, and science fiction. If you haven't seen this movie, check it out! I give this movie a 10 out of 10."

Linda Hamilton is truly human and believable as a young oblivious individual. Arnold Schwarzenegger is okay, but he isn't given enough to do in this first instalment to really make an impression.\n\nFor the most part the film is good and watchable, but the screenplay and cinematography isn't as good as it could be. There is a lack of top tier theatrical sense and it feels dated even for its time.\n\nIn addition the middle act involving a number of new characters is not interesting, and breaks up the tension and flow. The action is generic and not particularly engaging.\n\nWhat does work very well is the final act, where director 'James Cameron' sets the film alight and produces the best set designs and music score, leading to a satisfactory conclusion."

ALthough the film's budget was somewhat low, the film managed to earn a lot of respect and attention from fans of the science fiction genre.\n\nThe movie's storyline is very imaginative. It features a story of time-travel mixed with action elements, and a dose of romance. The special effects were pretty good for its time. The action scenes were very fierce, which can leave the viewers on the edge of their seats. And the romantic chemistry between Michael Biehn's & Linda Hamilton's characters was very believable, and it makes the viewer want to know more about their characters.\n\nMost of the film was shot at night, which gives the atmosphere in the movie a more darker feeling. It also helped the film-makers' greatly because the budget was very low.\n\nAnd finally, the Terminator itself is arguably Arnold Schwarzenegger's best role. He fits the role of the musclebound cyborg perfectly. Furthermore, he was very believable as a half-man-half-machine \"bounty hunter\". Plus, he was really scary.\n\nOverall, The Terminator is an excellent sci-fi film with a great storyline and great actors & actresses. It is a true Sci-Fi classic that spawned a great sequel and was referenced in many later films. If you haven't seen the movie yet, I highly recommend that you do so."

        "review_detailed_main": "When James Cameron finally got the Terminator made, the studio refused to advertise it as a \"science fiction film\", which puzzled Cameron. When he asked why, they said it didn't count as science fiction because it wasn't set in outer space like Star Trek and Star Wars. Jim shot back that it was science fiction because it dealt with time travel and cyborgs. This was significant for science fiction film making because, as much fun as those out of this world galaxies are, science fiction can still be compelling when set on Earth. The film also made a star out of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Well, technically \"Conan the Barbarian\" did that, but \"Terminator\" helped him break out of costume films and get into the shoot 'em ups.\n\nArnold plays the title character, a robot in human skin sent back to 1984 LA to kill Sarah Connor (a 28 year old Linda Hamilton with her hair dyed dirty blond), a good natured but lonely, somewhat scatter-brained, hapless waitress who has no idea of just how important she really is: she's the mother of John Connor, the man who will save what's left of the human race in the year 2019 when the machines have almost succeeded in taking over the world. Sarah's only hope is Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn, who later starred in James Cameron's \"Aliens\" and \"The Abyss\"), a soldier sent back from the future to protect her from the Terminator. Chaos and mayhem ensue, along with a high body count and the unexpected love story between Sarah & Kyle, the latter who turns out to be John Connor's father. Oh the irony of Kyle's response to Sarah's question about John's father: \"John never said much about him... I know he dies before the war.\"\n\nYes, some of the special effects are dated (namely the puppet head used for the scene where the Terminator cuts out its damaged eye and a few of the stop motion effects) and it's set in its era and it kind of runs out of steam towards the end, but the rest of the film is great: it's dark, it's eerie, it's seamy, it's atmospheric, it's violent, it's got pretty much everything. Arnold dominates pretty much every scene he's in. Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton are sympathetic protagonists.\n\nPersonally, I like this one better than the sequels, possibly because there's no Edward Furlong in it. The big difference between the films is that the original was more of a thriller, an extended chase scene, whereas the sequels were more about style and special effects and blow you away action sequences. But it's all good in the end. This is also a great examination of what could happen should technology get out of hand, ala \"Blade Runner\".\n\nThe DVD has two options of sound effects, the old mono system and a newer, more sophisticated one. I highly advise you not to listen to the newer sound system because it makes everything in the film sound really fake. The DVD also has deleted scenes, mostly notably a scene where Reese suffers an emotional break down over being displaced in time, an angle that never surfaced in the film but would have been very interesting to bring up.\n\n\"I'll be back.\""

If you line this movie up with Halloween, The Warriors, The Thing, Alien and a few others from the late '70s to the mid '80s, you have what amounts to a latter day golden age of science fiction/action/horror films.\n\nIf you're a fan, you've seen this movie countless times. If you haven't seen it, see it now. It's definitely better than the sequels."

Film wisely gives the audience time to catch their breath. But the police are not merely there for comic relief, they take their job completely serious; it is their interaction with each other which evokes laughter. Yet they still have no idea what they have to protect her from, and are hopelessly at a loss when confronted by it.\n\nCalling, yet foreboding music score is a major asset. The metallic *ting* sound heard throughout the score give the film an industrial/ found object feel, which only compliments the film's tone.\n\nClassic and influential; marred only by a dippy, out-of-place love story subplot, which comes from out of nowhere and makes no sense."

        "review_detailed_main": "The story goes that the inspiration behind the idea of the Terminator films derives from a bout of illness its creator, James Cameron, had whilst working on a previous project that had tumbled into being a bit of a creative nightmare. Frantically trying to piece what turned out to be \"Piranha: The Spawning\" together in an edit lab against a ticking clock, Cameron became run down by something which gave him all sorts of unpleasant dreams about indestructible robots chasing him; his life being in mortal danger and nobody believing him.\n\nIt is perhaps the nightmarish quality of \"The Terminator\" which really allows it to stand out. Let us not mince our words, here \u2013 Cameron essentially hopped from one exploitation feature to another in making it. Everything that needs to be present for an effective Z-movie is present: the gore; the action; the nudity; the causality and the lack of a plot. That is not to be rude to the IDEA, which is wonderful - a robot killing machine is sent back in time to assassinate the mother of a brave resistance leader, who is proving to be a thorn in the side of the metal maniacs in their attempts to wipe out every last human-being. One of Cameron's characters even pokes fun at the premise, describing what the robot is attempting to do as a kind of \"retroactive abortion\". It is, however, little more than a cue for all-out mayhem across the urban sprawl of Los Angeles.\n\nWe have all read the essays and digested the feminist theory which revolves around the character of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) enough times by now for anybody to need to rehash it here. Put simply, Connor is the aforementioned target \u2013 the protagonist who learns of her destiny and is taken from being your generic bimbo, and a useless waitress, to a brave soldier. Later theory would revolve around Connor and the Terminator character transgressing their respective roles in the sequel, which had the 'killer' robot being reprogrammed to become a mother/guardian figure and Hamilton's character tooling up to wipe out a defenceless anomaly (Miles Bennett Dyson) for being something they were not even privy to.\n\nChasing Connor here is Arnold Schwarzenegger's titular Terminator: a metal exoskeleton operating underneath living flesh tissue and impervious to the pathetic weaponry of the 1980's, while also sent back is one of the future humans' top fieldsmen in Kyle Reece (Michael Biehn). One of the most endearing things about watching the film now, I suppose, is that each are playing the roles they are most famous for. The opening exchanges, as both time-travellers adapt to their surroundings; tools up to take the other on and go about hunting down Sarah, are good value. We witness The Terminator dealing with three rough-shot punks upon arrival with the simplest of ease, while Reece is depicted as actually having to run away and hide when the police pick up on his otherworldly arrival. Cameron's goal is fairly obvious: the odds are stacked against the good guys.\n\nWhat follows is by no means 'bad', but it is remarkable as to how quickly the film settles into a causality driven process of action; chase and recovery \u2013 something is to be said, however, in the way Cameron kicks things back into life via the ingenious ways the Terminator picks back up on his prey again when it seems they've gotten away. More substantial is Cameron's social commentary, not to mention the love story which develops between Reece and Connor. Cameron shoots on location in Los Angeles at night, capturing the down-to-Earth reality of homelessness; street hoodlums and the general junk and filth which litters the streets \u2013 making, in the process, a correlation between the nightmarish ruined LA of the future, where the war is taking place. The film goes on to use a very clever transitional edit using a caterpillar track during scene whereby Reece falls asleep and dreams of the future to reiterate this: utopias do not exist.\n\nDigging a little deeper, and analysing some of the franchise's cod-philosophies to do with destiny; making the future what it is and not being bound to your fate, may very well reveal one or two more truths, but that is for the individual viewer. On the whole, and while I am unsure as to whether there is as much substance here as everybody seems to remember, \"The Terminator\" does very little of what it attempts to do especially badly, and I think that is what propels its lasting power."

The year is 2029 and a mercenary cyborg called the Terminator is sent back to 1984 to kill the mother of the human resistance leader and savior, John Connor. The Terminators plan is being held back by a man named Kyle Reese who is there to protect her and the rest is bloody history. the movie is a intense action flick with decent action, a good story, and the most iconic scene in movie history, the police shoot out. i highly recommend this movie for anyone who wants a good flick from the 80's and to see when movies actually has effort put into them, there are a few exceptions here and there."

        "review_detailed_main": "Who can turn down a James Cameron film like this? The Terminator (1984) is a classic on every level. The story was brilliantly written. The cast that was chosen for each role was done perfectly. The special effects, although very outdated by today's standards, still entertains and inspires the next generation of sci-fi filmmakers. And the music was an extreme role player throughout.\n\nThe whole story itself is an enormous step in a new direction. At the time, no one was truly thinking about the possible downside to artificial intelligence. But who could have thought that machines could become smarter than humans and decide to take over? Well James Cameron did. The plot is so in depth with detail that it's hard not to become involved in the plot as well.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger being the choice of the Terminator was the best choice the casting department could have ever done. Not only is he good but he can be quite terrifying too. Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor was accurate because although she's scared quite often throughout the running time, she later becomes a much stronger individual. And Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese was a good choice too because he definitely acts and looks like a run down soldier looking to find a way to change the future that he came from.\n\nStan Winston and his team of specialists provide the special effects and boy do they look great. With a mix of using puppetry and stop-motion animation, the entire look of the terminator is very interesting to watch. Not to mention that this thing can take a beating, either by its enemies or by itself! And the music by Brad Fiedel adds the final touch to the film. Fiedel makes the music have a sci-fi tone and whenever the terminator is on screen, there's a certain theme to it that gives it a very ominous feel. It's very creepy, but effective! It's surprising that director Cameron came to such glory from this movie after he directed such a sub-par film known as Piranha Part II: The Spawning (1981)!\n\nThis is the film that launched director James Cameron into show biz. With all the elements picked out perfectly, The Terminator is bound to strike the right chord."

I see it as the last one. Sure the action is great and Arnold as the terminator is just bad-ass. But I feel that it contains a message(or warning) that maybe technology moves at a speed that may cause it to harm us in the end. When you think about it, when this movie came out, many of the things in the movie seemed impossible. But now only 30 years later we are closing in on \"The Terminator\" future. In this age technology are used to make weapons more and more advanced, and we are already using robots on the battlefield(for example the predator drone).\n\nThis makes me think, where will it stop (if ever), and will we in the end have made such powerful weapons that it exposes a threat to mankind... something to think about.\n\nI'll be back"

Similarly movies like Jaws did the same. Very rarely do we come across movies of the calibre of Jaws or The Terminator. I am writing this in 2015, about 31 years after the movie after I realised how culturally and socially significant this movie turned out to be. You may not feel the impact fully if you watch this movie today, but the impact of the story is still present. Anyone keen on watching modern interpretations and sequels MUST watch this first!

        "review_detailed_main": "Continuing my plan to watch every Arnold Schwarzenegger movie in order, I come to his second movie of 1984 The Terminator.\n\nPlot In A Paragraph: A cyborg (Arnie) is sent from the future with one mission. Kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) a young woman whose life will have a great significance in years to come. Sarah has only one protector, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) also sent from the future.\n\nTo those that say Arnie can't act, I say watch this movie. He is TOTALLY believable as a non human!! I say that in jest of course, but it is his best performance thus far.\n\nHe never could have took the role if Dino De Laurentis didn't release him from his 10 year Conan contract. He agreed, but asked Arnie to keep making Conans as long as they were profitable (Thankfully after the lukewarm reception to Conan The Destroyer, Dino never wanted to make another) and to make an action movie for him when he had a script. Arnie agreed, and was free to make other movies away from Dino.\n\nThe $750,000 Arnie was paid for this was less than the $1,000,000 he was paid for the last Conan movie, but boy does it pay off. James Cameron is a genius, how all this came out of his head is amazing, and this is only his second feature film is beyond me. It's scarily brilliant. Everything is brilliant. The script is brilliant, the casting is brilliant, the performances are brilliant, the way it's shot is brilliant, Brad Fiedel's score is brilliant, Stan Wilsons special effects are brilliant, everything is brilliant.\n\nI've already praised Arnies performance, but Michael Biehn is also brilliant as the battled scarred, but brave Kyle Reece and Linda Hamilton is excellent as Sarah Connor too. I can't fault a single performance in the movie.\n\nA few dodgy effects here and there, and the implausibility of the plot (I still can't get my head around how Kyle can be John Connors Dad lol) are not enough to ruin anything.\n\nIn his autobiography Total Recall, Arnie talks about how the role of the Terminator only having 18 lines worried him, he worried people think he was either avoiding speaking parts, or worse, most of of his dialogue was edited out because it wasn't working.\n\nHe also discusses how bad the promotion was for this movie. They had it as a standard B movie, he says how Cameron begged them to change the strategy of it, but they would not listen to him!! They were only interested in promoting Amadeus. The movie succeeded because of solid reviews and good word of mouth.\n\nThe Terminator grossed $38 million at the domestic Box Office making it the 21st highest grossing movie of 1984. Surprisingly neither was enough to beat Conan The Barbarian as a career high for Arnie at that point.\n\nIn a way, it's lucky for Arnie, Terminator wasn't a giant blockbuster, as he may have been typecast as a bad guy. As it was, he did a favour for Dino."

It is a violent movie which showcases murder and White masculinity. I would never recommend this piece of trash to anyone.\n\nThere's much more than this short paragraph to describe this film, however. This science fiction film, directed by James Cameron, has become a classic despite what I have previously stated. The horrid violence of this film is not the worst part, but rather than even the time travel to the past is not very interesting either. Other movies have much better forms of time travel than this film. You could say that film is, like the New York Times said when it was first released, \"B-movie with flair,\" or like the Pittsburgh Press and say it has \"artsy ugliness.\" Both of those views have validity. I would add that this film pushed Arnold Schwarzenegger further to stardom and is one of the films is is most known for, not surprisingly.\n\nOtherwise, I don't think it is worth reviewing this film any further as I'd rather review more worthwhile films, with this film definitely deserving a rating of 1 out of 10, one of the lowest ratings I have ever given a movie."

And stronger than anything on earth.\n\nThese are the specs of the Terminator - a cyborg sent from the future to the past - Year: 1984 ,Location: Los Angeles.\n\nMission: to kill Sarah Connor, mother of John Connor: a leader of a resistance movement in the future and a main threat to Skynet.\n\nSkynet: an artificially intelligent system, a defense computer network built by the developed by the defense firm Cyberdyne Systems for the United States armed forces, which became self-aware and revolted against its creators.\n\nUnder John Connor, the human resistance turned the tide on the machines and eventually destroyed Skynet's defense grid. In a last ditch effort, Skynet sent a cyborg, called a \"Terminator\", back in time to 1984 to kill Connor's mother Sarah before she would give birth to John.\n\nProtector for Sarah against the terminator: John Connor sent back his own operative, a young man named Kyle Reese, to save Sarah.\n\nQuestion is which one will reach Sarah first: The Terminator or Kyle?\n\nSchwarzenegger (who plays the cyborg) was not as excited by the film; during an interview on the set of Conan the Barbarian, an interviewer asked him about a pair of shoes he had (which were for The Terminator). Schwarzenegger responded, \"Oh some sh*t movie I'm doing, take a couple weeks.\"\n\nIn preparation for the role, Schwarzenegger spent three months training with weapons to be able to use them and feel comfortable around them.\n\nFor the role of Reese, various other suggestions were made for the role including rock musician Sting. Cameron chose Michael Biehn for the role. Biehn was originally skeptical about the part, feeling that the movie was silly. After meeting with Cameron, Biehn stated his \"feelings about the project changed\". Hurd stated that \"almost everyone else who came in from the audition was so tough that you just never believed that there was gonna be this human connection between (Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese). They have very little time to fall in love. A lot of people came in and just could not pull it off.\"\n\nOn its opening week, The Terminator played at 1,005 theaters and grossed $4,020,663 making it number one in the box office. The film remained at number one in its second week. It lost its number one spot in the third week to Oh, God! You Devil.\n\nAfter writer Harlan Ellison saw the film, he stated that he \"loved the movie, was just blown away by it\". Ellison believed that the screenplay for the film was based on the episodes \"Soldier\" and \"Demon with a Glass Hand\" which he wrote for the television series The Outer Limits. Orion gave Ellison an undisclosed amount of money and gave him an acknowledgement credit in later prints of the film. Cameron was against Orion's decision and was told that that if he did not agree with the settlement, they would have Cameron pay for any damages if Orion lost Ellison's suit. Cameron replied that he \"had no choice but to agree with the settlement. Of course there was a gag order as well, so I couldn't tell this story, but now I frankly don't care. It's the truth. Harlan Ellison is a parasite who can kiss my *ss.\"\n\nFilms similar to The Terminator: D.A.R.Y.L. (1985), The Vindicator (1986),Assassin (TV 1986), Robocop (1987),Programmed to Kill (1987), Cy Warrior (1989), Eve Of Destruction (1991), Steel and Lace (1991),Nemesis (1992), Shadowchaser (1992), Cyborg Cop (1993), Bicentennial Man (1999).\n\nWhew! Not easy to compile a good list! I have seen all the above films except Steel and Lace. I recommend Assassin, Eve Of Destruction, Programmed To Kill, Cy Warrior among the rare films.\n\nEmail me Vivekmaru45@yahoo.com for more movies lists.\n\nThanks for reading."

Not only that, it's remained one of the most popular action films of the last twenty years, it's continued to delight young and old alike. Added to the mix is icon Arnold Schwarzenegger, and you have yourself one fun romp through both the present and the future.\n\nWhen offered his job in The Terminator, Schwarzenegger was supposed to play good guy Kyle Reese, who became Michael Biehn. Schwarzenegger then played The Terminator, a cyborg from the future that came to the present (aka 1984) to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), whose son Michael would start in a giant war, etc. You'll figure out the plot as you go along for the ride.\n\nThe Terminator has something that most action movies now need: action! Instead of PG-13ing it and making it look hokey, James Cameron decided to make it as lifelike as could be, and it really did look lifelike. The effects on Schwarzenegger when he was half-human, half-cyborg looked very real, and would be considered impressive by today's standards. Not being a gigantic gore fan, I did cringe a little, but it was very cool.\n\nMy rating: 7/10\n\nRated R for violence/gore, some language, and brief nudity."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is iconic, a ton of references are made about it to this day and I love the intro song from the movie to the point I could draw with it on or something to get the right mood however this movie hasn't aged very well in my opinion. Sure this movie is close to 40 years old but these are many ways I didn't care for it.\n\nFirstly it's too long, it's poorly paced, some scenes could have been cut out entirely and not affected the movie at all to keep us from being bored and trust me there's a few of them. Though I admire James for having the credits in their own place, not just stamped over the movie while we try to focus on the story yet are curious who is in this.\n\nThe action was very well done especially for the time in some regards. I love how as Reese fights against The Terminator he loses an eye and other stuff happens to that iconic last scene with him in it. The drive by shooting and everything. You can tell Jean Claude Van Damme was heavily inspired by Arnold's role in this when he did the far better \"Universal Soldier\" movie. Seriously go watch it if you haven't. It's everything this basic movie isn't.\n\nThere are some great shots of LA, almost everything has this cold blue tint to it.\n\nThe casting of Sarah and Kyle Reese were so terrible. It reminded me of Lisa and Mark from the movie The Room (2003), Sarah doesn't have the look and can remotely act but she's no super model which can be a good thing and Reese can't act his way out of a wet paper bag. Both of their hair styles are hideous. Reese's character isn't as believable as I'd want him to be. He doesn't have that look of an action hero or whatever we're supposed to believe he is. I can't take his voice seriously. There is an intimate scene in it which even I think Tommy Wiseau would go this isn't good. I'm not expecting stuff on a certain hub but still, 80s romance scenes are hilarious.\n\nThe soundtrack consists of \"angry super nintendo\" music for the most part and it gets on your nerves how dull it is, yet sounds like that you'd expect from a movie in the future I guess because that is what mouth breathers expect in their crappy sci-fi movies.\n\nThe only thing bad I can say about Arnold is when he fires any gun he blinks his eyes, yeah a robot would totally do that. He plays the role well. Though the claymation used would be laughed at today. The CGI for the terminator walking is so poorly paced. I see what virgin slayer 12 year old pro gamers talk about when they mention low frame rate now i think. Some of the CGI can look alright, again this movie was ground breaking but it should have came out a few years later.\n\nHow they set this movie up for a sequel was lazy too though they did address a lot of stuff such as why they are naked when they travel though time.\n\nI honestly enjoyed going to the washroom more after finishing this dreadful movie, maybe if you were a kid in the 80s and nothing else was like this out at the time it would have been iconic but seeing it now and all the movies it inspired is like \"flooring it\" in a 1920s car to a car made today. Not even talking sports cars either."

        "review_detailed_main": "I just re-watched this movie; the last time I saw it was approximately 1987. For a 1984 production, this is superb science fiction. The Terminator, like Blade Runner, represents the best of the early '80s and even today has not really been surpassed despite decades of advances in CGI, digital processing, etc.\n\nThe Terminator robot behaves more or less as one might expect. James Cameron is intelligent enough not to ruin the movie by anthropomorphizing the robot, in other words making it display emotions and behave too humanly. It's a computer created by computers, and acts accordingly. Arnold Schwarzenegger was at his physical peak and did a superb job conveying the sheer evil that this machine represents.\n\nSarah and Kyle were well played. She was an \"average girl\" working at a busy family restaurant and dating mediocre guys in her spare time. We watch her grow into the strong soldier that she must become to defeat not only the Terminator but to raise a revolutionary hero who will save humanity.\n\nKyle came across as a soldier who is very good at his profession, but has little exposure to the finer things, having grown up in a horrible post-apocalyptic world. He finally softens and opens up to Sarah, sparking a love affair that is heartbreakingly brief.\n\nYou can enjoy the Terminator and simply ignore the fact that there are sequels. #2 is not bad, but quite superfluous and contradictory to the first movie in which it was made clear that \"no one goes home, and no one else comes through\" the time machine which was smashed by the humans. The first movie is an epic story and needs no sequels. But #2 is fun if you must see a little more Arnold-as-robot."

        "review_detailed_main": "In the not-too-distant future, machines rule the Earth and are locked in combat with a gallant band of freedom fighters led by their leader John Connor. Soon a murderous cyborg the T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) - a remorseless, relentless bogeyman with a bone- crushing steel skeleton and a soul-piercing red diode glare - is sent back in time from the future to kill the mother of the as-yet- unborn leader of the human rebellion. Back in present-day Los Angeles, his mother \u2013 a timorous pushover waitress Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) - is unaware of her role in the struggles to come, until the arrival of our titular terminator, whose only purpose is to kill her and thereby change the future. Her only hope is a bashful guerrilla fighter Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) who has followed the T-800 back through time to prevent her death and evade any and all attacks from the killer cyborg, while gradually forming a romance with her throughout the mission to preserve her life. Can the Terminator track Sarah down and change the course of the future?\n\nThe story is deceptively tricky: In comparison to today's packaged thrillers, this is a surprisingly vicious little film, filled with indiscriminate killings and a rough-edged feel that makes it utterly compelling. James Cameron's direction of the ensuing chaos is masterful, and the characterization of the violence has something agonizingly original about it. He manages to generate maximum excitement from the very first frame and the dynamic thrills are maintained right up to the nerve-jangling climax. What really propels the movie, though, isn't the savagery but a well-written and taut screenplay with a nice eye for sharp detail that doesn't tend to drift off into the occasional ponderous bits. There's real heart and soul here, along with Arnold's best-ever performance - as a lumbering slab of dumb, destructive strength. Hamilton's performance as the bewildered waitress who will unwittingly become the savior of the human race is terrific. Biehn shines as Sarah's knight in shining armor.\n\nThe Terminator grabs us right away and carries us to the end with roller-coaster action sequences and clever time-travel twists. What it results in is arguably the best science fiction thriller of all time that throttles you with the air of a demented ballet."

This film never had the budget its successor had and it sadly shows. Still I consider this a piece every one should have seen at least once if they are even remotely interested in sci-fi and/or action movies.

        "review_detailed_main": "Is it heresy to suggest that The Terminator may be a tad overrated? That perhaps fans who so love the whole Terminator saga and mythology remember the original film as being a little better than it actually was? This low budget sci-fi action thriller is certainly an enjoyable film. And considering the franchise it spawned and all the other films it so obviously influenced it's also an important film. But does that necessarily make it a truly great film? Probably not. It's a good film, very good in spots, but there are enough things holding it back to leave it a touch shy of greatness.\n\nBy now most everyone knows the film's story so a plot rehash seems rather unnecessary. In a nutshell a cyborg Terminator is sent back from the future to kill Sarah Connor, the mother of the as yet unborn human resistance leader who in that post-apocalyptic future will lead the fight against the machines which seek to exterminate humanity. Convoluted? You bet. Of course the Terminator has not come from the future alone. Human resistance fighter Kyle Reese has been sent back to protect Sarah. He must stop the unstoppable Terminator. Good luck with that. Shootouts and car chases and explosions ensue. Plot? Story? Dialogue? Sorry, don't have much for you here. But have I mentioned the explosions? Everyone likes seeing things get blown up right?\n\nAs I've implied, after the story initially sets itself up there really isn't much of a story at all. The whole movie is one big chase. Certainly there are moments of great excitement but in between the big moments...well there's often not much. At times things are rather sluggish. But there's enough good stuff here to make this at least an enjoyable flick if not some kind of all-time classic film. Of course there are some very memorable characters starting with the Terminator himself (itself?), played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. As a stiff, robotic, inhuman, largely mute killing machine Schwarzenegger's perfect. I'm not sure if that says much for Schwarzenegger's acting ability but for this role in this movie who could be better? The Terminator doesn't have much to say but whenever he does speak you remember it. Seriously, it seems every line Arnold speaks in the movie turned into a catchphrase. Sarah Connor is a character who undergoes a serious evolution in the course of the film and Linda Hamilton portrays that wonderfully. From the sweet, innocent girl at the film's beginning to something else entirely by film's end Hamilton traces the character's journey terrifically. Schwarzenegger and Hamilton are remembered best but it may actually be Michael Biehn who gives the best performance of all as Kyle Reese. It is left to his character to explain to Sarah, and by extension to us, what the heck this movie is actually about. No small task that, making a truly preposterous, unbelievable story sound convincing. Now if you stop and think about that story you will realize there are plot holes large enough to drive an exploding tanker truck through. Time travel stories have their own peculiar issues. Paradoxes and all that. And this film's got a doozy of a paradox. So don't think about it. Just enjoy the movie for what it is. Even if it's not truly as great as it is generally remembered to be what it is ain't bad at all."

The puppets are laughably bad, and Arnold Schwarzenegger's iconic face-hugging scene in the bathroom is downright embarrassing. The action sequences are equally lackluster, featuring unconvincing stunts and choppy editing.\n\nBeyond the technical shortcomings, the movie's writing is equally weak. The plot is clich\u00e9 and predictable, the dialogue is clunky and forced, and the characters are underdeveloped and unlikable. The music is also a major letdown, failing to create any sense of atmosphere or tension.\n\nWhile the story itself might have had potential, it simply couldn't be executed with the technology available in 1984. The movie requires a high budget and modern filmmaking techniques to make the futuristic setting believable.\n\nOverall, \"The Terminator\" is a disappointing and outdated film that fails to live up to its reputation. Despite its cult status, it's a clear example of why futuristic movies from a certain era just don't hold up."

But even I saw R rated stuff like this, robocop and predator.\n\nIn the 80's, no one coined as much catchphrases and kicked so much butt and killed many people like Arnold. Long before he was an old action star in the expendables, he was a hungry actor and after this, he will learn English and get muscular in commando.\n\nThe first in a series of 6 chapters, follows Arnold as the t800, a cold, emotionless, killer cyborg as he kills punks, some woman, wrecking havoc and Sarah Connor, played by Linda Hamilton, a cute teenager working in a dead end job u til the news say that the fake Sarah connor died and her friend said, \"you're dead, honey\"\n\nLater, the plot gets more tense as the other man from the future is Kyle reese, played by Michael biehn.\n\nI like the scene in a bar called tech noir and some music, which sounds like pat benatar, blasts In the night club. Then just as the t800 tries to shoot, Kyle shoots him and they escape and ran. Then car chases ensue and more mayhem appears. James Cameron knows how to make an action movie.\n\nThe finale is cool as they battle the t800.\n\nLet me stop before I spoil it. The music of Brad friedel is a techno score with dark, depeche mode-like, synthesizer blasts and pounding drum machines.\n\nThe first movie was a smash hit and begins the long running franchise. It also inspired the anime/cyberpunk craze with appleseed and ghost In the shell. The terminator is my go to action film one of the best of the 80's."

Even if I'd seen it at an impressionable age such macho machinations were never my bag.\n\nAn impregnable robot sent from 45 years in the way distant future to kill a woman who will have an important son, and another man from the future is sent to save her\u0085and unwittingly impregnate her too. Busy! The futuristic '80's music is as cheap, backward and laughable as Blade Runner's is, they also share a vision of an extremely grim future. The present is merely cars girls guns and mayhem after all. Schwarzenegger as the Terminator robot acted totally believably, and when reduced to the hilarious internal metal frame he acted with even more passion; but Harryhausen's stop motion skeletons in Jason & The Argonauts were as kittens in comparison. Made at the butt-end of the olde analogue age I bet director Cameron wished he could have done a Lucas-like Revision to it and rebooted it with cgi cartoonery for the special effects instead. However, the over the top violence was expected and delivered - the utter childishness of the multiple random killings only proves yet again to me how valueless some human film makers think other human beings lives are and therefore the contempt they must hold the audiences in. But I do realise you don't have to be in the Army to fight in the War, and most importantly this is mild stuff compared to nowadays. The film was all I expected, take away the viciousness and you might have a very good little b film."

Before building his \"cool\" movie star persona, he portrayed the creepy cybernetic killer with tremendous dedication to the craft (learning to fire without blinking, learning to reload without looking at the weapon, letting the production shave off his eyebrows for a crucial scene - though not before having them insured) and character choices like the now iconic \"scanning\" where his eyes move before his head.\n\nIn fact, the cast are all excellent. Michael Biehn brings a great deal of vulnerability to the film's time travelling hero, Linda Hamilton is wonderful as always, and the supporting cast are all likeable.\n\nThe future sequences are brilliant and terrifying, and the time travel story is easy to follow and never indulges in pretentiousness despite its bittersweet \"twist\"\n\nThe choice to shoot most of the action at night gives the film a unique \"noir\" flavor. The action is thrilling and the pacing is pitch-perfect, a fantastic showcase of James Cameron's ability to tell a story and keep the audience on the edge of their seats despite the comparatively low budget when put next to the rest of his filmography.\n\nIf I was forced to find fault with The Terminator, it would be that some of the special effects have aged poorly. But with the exception of a few shots of the \"Arnold dummy\" and the stop motion towards the end, most of them still look very impressive.\n\nThis movie is as close to perfect as an action thriller can get. I can't recommend it enough."

John Connor also sends someone back in time to protect his mother.\n\nIt's interesting to see how much Sarah ( Hamilton) developed through the films.

The film's dialogue, in general, is often clich\u00e9d and uninspired.\n\nWhile \"The Terminator\" has its moments of tension and action, it ultimately falls short of being the thrilling, thought-provoking experience it could have been. Fans of retro sci-fi might appreciate it for its nostalgia value, but for me, it fails to live up to the hype."

Some people complain of boredom in the film. Yes, I agree there are some small scenes of boredom but it did not significantly affect my experience with the film. Arnold perfectly played the role of terminator. I cannot imagine another actor representing the character. Sarah and Kyle's relationship was also interesting but could have been made much better. The plot, soundtrack, acting... everything in the movie was great.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this movie to everyone... literally everyone."

It created some careers; it originated one of the best film franchises; it produced iconic lines and scenarios; and it even brought some important concepts into society's consciousness .\n\nIt all starts with a killer script. Two men from the future are transported back to 1984 to locate Sarah Connor---a young waitress--- for mysterious reasons. Sarah (Linda Hamilton) finds herself embroiled in an unbelievable plot that changes her life. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays his role with a physical presence that makes his remarkable character believable.\n\nThough many are familiar with the film's plot, I will not divulge it here on the off-chance there is one person who does not know its beautifully complex story. There are moments of humor, moments of awe, moments of tenderness, and plenty moments of suspense and/or fear.\n\nJames Cameron's amazing directorial career really began with this gem. It's a film that people watch again and again."

The storyline follows a young lady looking for her direction in life when a mysterious man appears and tells her she's the savior of all life and needs to go on the run with him. Initially she doesn't believe him but when a ruthless man starts hunting them down armed to the teeth she decides running rather than staying put may be a good idea.\n\nThis movie is directed by James Cameron (Titanic) and stars Arnold Schwarzenegger (The Running Man), Linda Hamilton (Dante's Peak), Lance Henriksen (Pumpkinhead), Michael Biehn (Aliens), Bill Paxton (Frailty) and Dick Miller (Gremlins).\n\nThe storyline for this is very unique, fascinating and intricate. The action scenes were way ahead of their time, especially the mirror scene and any scenes with robotics. Arnold was perfectly cast as a menacing, overbearing character that seems unbeatable. The shootouts, crashes and chases are science fiction gold.\n\nOverall this is an all time great movie and American cinematic gold. This is an easy 10/10 that I would strongly recommend seeing."

        "review_detailed_main": "While Terminator 2: Judgment Day often steals the spotlight, it's the original The Terminator to me that quietly stands as a superior entry in the series. The film might not have the explosive action or groundbreaking CGI of its successor, but it excels in areas that make it a classic in its own right-sometimes overlooked in the shadow of its blockbuster sequel.\n\nWhat makes The Terminator so compelling is its raw, relentless energy. The film operates more like a horror-thriller, with a cold, unstoppable force in the form of Arnold Schwarzenegger's T-800 hunting down Sarah Connor. The sense of dread is palpable, with James Cameron expertly building tension through a tight script and relentless pacing. The gritty atmosphere and the low-budget aesthetic only add to the film's intensity, making it feel more immediate and dangerous. Schwarzenegger's portrayal of the T-800 is iconic. His minimal dialogue and emotionless delivery make him the perfect embodiment of a machine; one that's terrifyingly efficient in its mission. Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor, on the other hand, is relatable and grounded, growing from an ordinary woman into a figure of resilience and determination. The chemistry between her and Michael Biehn's Kyle Reese adds an emotional layer to the film, giving it heart amid the chaos.\n\nOne of the film's strongest points is its concept. The idea of a machine sent from the future to alter the past is fascinating and was quite innovative for its time. The movie dives into the themes of fate, technology, and survival in a way that feels more intimate and urgent than its sequels. It's a lean, mean story that doesn't get bogged down by too much exposition, letting the action and tension do most of the talking.\n\nHowever, The Terminator isn't without its minor flaws. The special effects, while groundbreaking in 1984, can feel dated by today's standards, especially during the final showdown. Some of the dialogue is a bit clunky, and the budget constraints show in certain scenes where the film's ambitions slightly exceed its means.\n\nBut these are small criticisms in the grand scheme of things. The Terminator excels where it counts - storytelling, atmosphere, and character development. It's a film that has aged well, retaining its power and impact even decades later. While Terminator 2 often gets the praise, the original The Terminator deserves more recognition as the film that laid the foundation for everything that followed. It's leaner, meaner, and arguably more focused, making it a standout entry that sometimes gets overlooked in favor of its flashier sequel."

I would say the film thrilled the heck out of us and probably scared my kid half to death, but the fact is, we were in a brightly lit hotel room and the TV wasn't particularly large. I know we were bowled over by the police station sequence and the final chase at the very least. This is one of Ah-nuld's best roles, and director James Cameron knows how to keep things moving along on a shoestring budget. The scene where Ah-nuld must deal with a partially ruined face is unforgettable. T2 came along a few years later and put the original to shame, much like ALIENS did to ALIEN. But if it were not for THE TERMINATOR, where would we be today? A groundbreaking sci-fi thriller, loosely based on a TV program and very old short story, by the way, neither of which is credited, as I recall."

This sci-fi action epic is about a human soldier sent from 2029 to 1984 to stop a seemingly unstoppable cyborg killing machine.\n\n'The Terminator' is the film that made Arnold Schwarzenegger a MEGA movie star!\n\nThis classic from the '80s offers a very rewarding experience with a great concept for the story! Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator is absolutely fantastic. He really does look like a robot, excuse me, cyborg and he behaves accordingly! And oh, by the way, \"I'll be back\"!\n\nFurthermore I totally have to commend the phenomenal visual effects that, to this day, still look fantastic! The make-up department obviously deserves a lot of praise as well for doing such a good job!\n\nUnfortunately there are also a couple of problems that I have with this movie! I really don't like that there had to be a romance squished into this film! It was completely unnecessary and I just didn't buy it whatsoever! What made me even more frustrated was the motivation of our male hero, the reason why he went back in time. Absolutely preposterous! Another thing I don't like about this film is that killing off the Terminator seems to be ridiculously hard. I'll explain what I mean by that in an example. This film has a typical movie trope that's been in movies since forever! Just when you think a character probably died, nope, he or she comes back to life! And then this character supposedly \"dies again\", but nope, not dead. And guess what, the exact same thing happens... AGAIN! And of course after each supposed death, there is a celebration and a relief. I mean I am sick and tired of this type of storytelling... at least if it is done to this extreme! Finally I also had some issues with the pacing during a few scenes. Certain scenes were just too slow and really sucked the energy out of the film's flow, but for the most part, the film had pretty decent pacing!\n\nOverall, 'The Terminator' is a really fun and entertaining sci-fi action flick with a great villain as well as pure satisfaction for genre fans! 6/10"

This movie was indeed a work of passion even if it may not exactly be high brow.\n\nThe only thing I can really be negative about is the awkward use of puppetry but somehow Cameron manages to make you want to invest feeling with the right type pf humor and the right type of pathos along the way.\n\nThe ending always just makes me want to applaud and watch the sequel right away."

Reese also came from the future, but to protect Sarah from The Terminator, for reasons that come into detail later in the story.\n\nSchwarzenegger is fun as The Terminator. He only has about 10 lines to say in the entire movie, but I liked him in his futuristic role. Terminator is his most famous movie. It has action coming out the wazoo, but no real thrills. The 108 minute run-time seemed to go by quickly.\n\nThe special FX, for 1984, were pretty good. Despite what it seemed, the exo-skeleton at the end was not stop-motion as it looked like, it was an animatronic puppet. The explosions looked real, so did all the shootings, and everything else. Biehn was very good as the guy from the future. He seemed to know what he was doing. I wonder why he hasn't been in much lately, though.\n\nHamilton was good, too, as Sarah, but nothing to write home about. Terminator has set an example for others to follow in action movies. Many spoof movies have the \"terminator sight\", and say \"I'll be back\", and all the other catch phrases from the movie. I thought it also had some good places of humor, like all movies should. It is entertaining, also. The dreary look at the future seems almost farcical now, since we now know that there won't be a nuclear war around 1990. So that means it's a little outdated, but it's still fun (if lacking thrills), and recommended.\n\nMy rating: 6/10\n\nRated R for violence and some language."

        "review_detailed_main": "Love the sci fi ideas from the film that still hold weight today with AI and robotics technology. It almost plays like a sci fi Halloween movie, an unstoppable evil vs the protagonist on the run. Sara Connor and Arnold both deliver great performances (maybe Arnold's best), the action is cheesy 80s classic, and the plot is simple but clever. Film quality ultimately suffers though due to poor emotional execution from almost every other supporting character, the acting is just horrendous. I think the special effects were probably revolutionary, but the depth of the story is wasted in a lot of exposition through bland narration."

The stunts are crazy good.\n\nAnother great thing is that even though Arnold ( by the time the movie was made ) was/is a famous actor he manages to portray a cold blooded machine perfectly. He comes across as a pure threat. The story is fun ( sure , some logical flaws ) and it draws you in. I was really connected to it.\n\nI highly recommend it!"

This story is very thrilling, but has some emotional parts. I like the way to show that the strange man is very strong. He is in good shape, and also does not smile at all. When I thought of the time that this man comes to the real word, I could help feeling fearful. However, this happening is never occurred in this world, so I could enjoy watching the film. On the other hand, the content is a little bit complicated for me, especially, the relationships among people. One more thing I was surprised to see is that there are some grotesque scenes in the film. If you don't want to see blood or this kind of scenes, I recommend you to close your eyes, actually I did so. On the whole, it was thrilling, so for me, person who likes sort of this, it made me enjoy."

        "review_detailed_main": "Time-travel. Science fiction. Visions of the future. Action/Adventure. You name it, and \"The Terminator\", one of the most genre-diverse films ever made, probably has it.\n\nFor a basic plot summary, this movie begins in the year 1984. Out of thin air, two individuals suddenly appear and are searching for the same woman: Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). One man, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) wants to protect her. The other, a machine simple known as The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) wants to kill her. As the story unwinds and the chase continues, we are introduced to an intriguing storyline involving time-travel and the fate of the planet.\n\nSimply stated, this movie remains a classic to this day because it tells such an engaging, interesting story. It balances the time travel and sci-fi aspects with real-life drama and action. There is a little something for everyone.\n\nThis was the movie that made the name James Cameron famous, and one can tell that he put a lot of effort into this undertaking. He tells a story that is actually too big (technically-speaking) for it's britches, as it is now obvious that copious amounts of either CGI or plastic were used to create some of the effects. Instead of dating the film, though, these little anachronisms actually give it a bit of gravitas. It was as if Cameron wanted so badly to direct this story, but had to rely on sub-standard equipment to \"get the job done\".\n\nOverall, \"The Terminator\" is an 80s classic. It is now kind of stereotyped as \"I'll be back\" and \"just a shoot-em-up\" chase film, but that couldn't be further from the truth. Go back and watch it again, and I promise you'll be equally impressed with the storytelling ability. That, at it's core, is what makes this movie relevant 30 years later."

The rest of the cast did an amazing job, especially Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton. This movie has a lot of it's memorable great and intense moments as well.\n\nThe visual effects are not that good, but for it's time, it's an incredible feat. I have nothing to say anymore.

The year is 1984, A terminator (Arnold) is sent from the future to prevent John Connor being borned. John Connor is the leader of those who fight against the terminators. The terminator's job is then to hunt down the mother of the leader, Sarah Connor. But then, sent by John Connor, Kyle Reese. His mission is to protect Sarah from danger.\n\nThe film is relatively exciting, but somehow i lost the tense and the excitement when i got deeper into the movie. People have been talking about it and said it's really good, so i actually thought i was about to watch a masterpiece.\n\nIn my opinion, The Terminator is far from a masterpiece, but it's far from bad too. I mean Arnold did some decent acting, but then again he does play a robot. And the movie had 'some' Special FX that would even look good today. When i said 'some' i really mean it. Because most of the Special FX looks pretty lousy today, but i'm not going to judge the movie from that.\n\nSo to conclude this whole \"review\", if you like. I didn't really feel the movie. I understand completely how it must have been back in '84. But i'm living in a society where the audience demands are pretty high. So with all this concluded i can simply say that Terminator isn't a bad movie, but it isn't that great either. But it gives a pretty good picture of the future i guess.\n\n7/10 A good, not great, not excellent, but a good SCI-FI picture..."

She's a very smart woman, a quick decision maker, a natural warrior. She's forced a damsel in distress. Waiting for the world to give her the shot she knows isn't coming.\n\nWith these two, Cameron gives us one of the strongest, most underrated, action movie romances to ever see a grainy 35mm print."

It has many elements in its favor and it is difficult to find fault. The cast is quite good, among the most notable, Linda Halmiton, Michael Biehn, Lance Henricksen and Arnold of course. A solid script with a good plot. Most memorable is the soundtrack by Brad Fiedel, whose main theme became iconic, and the special effects by Stan Winston, which are already an admirable relic. The Terminator is one of those 80's movies that is worth seeing again. My rating for this movie is a 10/10."

Overall, the movie is decent in terms of a watch but as a movie overall lacks in a lot of areas, but these areas are definitely improved upon and made better with the sequel as the budget/experience to make a better movie was there."

        "review_detailed_main": "The story is just an excuse to accomplish what is indicated in the title. Schwarzenegger the soulless killing machine is the only superstar, everyone and everything else is a pale supporting cast. The story takes place in 2029, the movie is from 1984, so now we can tell it didn't hit anything from the future. Except for one, humanity's growing hopelessness about the future. The script is full of nonsense and goofs. Except for the \"clever\" move that all the cruelty and suffering in the not-yet-hell world of 1984 only takes place in order to save a guy's life in the hellish world of 2029 where no people are worth living.\n\nThe film presents the two most harmful clich\u00e9s. One is the brainwashing-like suggestion of a horrible future. Dystopia has been obligatory in science fiction since the 1980s, and prevails so strictly that no dictatorial censorship can compete with that. For 40 years, sci-fi has been pushing thousands of terrible visions of the future in a brainwashing fashion. -- However, a number of studies prove that these projections work as self-fulfilling prophecies: whatever visions you develop, live and act according to them, you fulfill them yourself.\n\nThe other most pathetically stupid and aggressive clich\u00e9 in the film is that machines and artificial intelligence (the Martians, the more developed aliens etc.) will obviously destroy or at best enslave humanity. That the more intelligent, the more evil and vice versa. -- The opposite is true. Evolution and destruction are opposites of each other. Of course boring idiots of power over all can annihilate life on earth and all the interesting things -- but no way I give them more stars than 2/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "'The Terminator (1984)'\n\nIn a world where artificial intelligence is rapidly becoming inescapable, the potential dangers of this technology have never been more pressing. It's a topic that's been explored in countless movies and books, but few have done it as well as \"The Terminator.\" With its harrowing vision of a future dominated by machines, James Cameron's classic becomes more relevant today than it was nearly four decades ago.\n\nWhilst \"The Terminator\" is commonly shoehorned into the Sci-Fi Genre, it transcends that label to become something much more. Its a perfect amalgamation of styles - a chilling horror undertone spearheaded by an unstoppable, emotionless killer that eclipses even Michael Myers. Spliced with breathtaking action sequences that stand the test of time, and dropped into an unbeknownst 1980's Los Angeles scene to create a dystopian epic feel that matches the despair of 'Blade Runner'. By combining these diverse genres, \"The Terminator\" becomes a masterpiece.\n\nIn a post-apocalyptic dystopian future - where humanity is at the mercy of tyrannical supercomputers - advanced teleportation technology is utilized to send T-800, a cyborg assassin, known as the \"Terminator,\" (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back in time to the year 1984. The Terminator's sole objective is to eliminate Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), whose unborn child is destined to lead a rebellion against the mechanical overlords of the 21st century.\n\nMeanwhile, the human resistance movement dispatches a solitary soldier, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), to safeguard Sarah in an effort to prevent the extinction of mankind.\n\nCan this lone protector successfully thwart the virtually indestructible killing machine, ensuring the survival of humanity?\n\nThe film thrusts us straight into the action with an ever-imposing Terminator setting out on a deadly mission to eliminate all women named Sarah Connor listed in a phone book, and after swiftly dispatching the first two, he sets his sights on the real target. Sarah is thrown into a terrifying world of danger and uncertainty, unaware of the dire consequences that await her if she falls into the cyborgs clutches.\n\nReese begins his mission at the Tech Noir night club in downtown LA, tasked with protecting her - 'come with me if you want to live' - Sarah must place her trust, and her life, into the hands of Reese for her own, and humanity's sake - she just doesn't know it yet.\n\nPraise must be given to James Cameron for his direction - he never lets too much time elapse without showing the Terminator. This keeps the T-800 firmly in our mind, as though Reese and Sarah are only a step ahead of him. The pacing is superb, it does a great job of telling the story amid the chaotic action unfolding in the background, and keeps you hooked for the entirety of its 107 minute run time.\n\nThe action scenes, like the tense car chases and the police precinct shootout, are followed up nicely with just enough exposition to demonstrate why Reese's mission is so important to the future of humanity, without being impeded by bloated, unnecessary dialogue. Every line has purpose, and Cameron wants you to know that what his characters are saying is important.\n\nVisually, no other actor could pull off what Arnie manages in his outing as T-800. He is physically menacing and imposing, and demands your attention whenever he is on screen. Speaking only 17 lines throughout the entirety of the film and not even as much as flinching when shooting double barrelled shotguns or tearing a punk's heart out with his bare (cyborg) hands - Arnie perfectly embodies the emotionless, determined machine. Everything and anyone that isn't Sarah Connor is just an obstacle to be thrown aside or shot in the head.\n\nOf course, being made on a very modest budget of only $6.4 Million, The Terminator's special effects do show their age. A scene of the T-800 repairing his face requires a noticeable Arnie mask which appears quite rubbery and unrealistic, whilst the stop-motion-esque portrayal of the mechanical skeleton during the climax of the movie appears less menacing the more you see it. Not saying the Terminator model looks bad - its exposed teeth and glaring red eyes remain iconic for a reason. But it just goes to show that even James Cameron - the visionary of Avatar's Pandora and the T-1000's liquid metal effects - had to start with low-grade tech at one point.\n\nOther than a small gripe over the aesthetics, it is near impossible to find much to complain about when it comes to The Terminator. The camera work is solid, the set pieces iconic and Cameron manages to give the condensed story a feeling of grandeur. Linda Hamilton turns in what is, to this day, still her greatest on screen performance and personifies a convincing 'waitress to world saver' character arc.\n\nThe supporting cast supplement the protagonist's journey well, Michael Biehn turns in a good performance portraying the PTSD stricken wreck of a man in Kyle Reese who is only way too familiar with how badly things could turn out if he fails in his mission and Paul Winfield, as pragmatic cop Traxler, voices some of the films limited humour.\n\n'The Terminator' has securely fastened its place in the 'all time great' lists in the last 40 years and it will likely be an even longer time before another idea as original and simultaneously scary as the T-800 hits our screens.\n\nAs we continue to grapple with the implications of artificial intelligence in our own lives, \"The Terminator\" remains a powerful reminder of the potential risks and dangers of this technology, and the need to approach it with caution and respect. Whilst it appears that A. I. is light years away from humans succumbing to a Terminator-style apocalypse, it is a worrying thought that one day a T-800 will be hunting down your name from a phone book (or more likely your Facebook page).\n\n9/10."

In fact, I'm shocked that it's rated lower than the sequel. We won't even mention anything after the 2nd film because they're just not worth it. They were for the kids. Now back to the film in question.\n\nWe all know the story, so I won't bother with explaining it. What I will do is give you my reasons as to why I think The Terminator is THE film of the franchise.\n\nThe Terminator is a much better character as a baddie, and as baddies go, he's BAD! Arnie nails it in the role which catapulted him into super-stardom and he is absolutely terrifying. Let's remember that while the action is still good, this is a 'horror' film, and while we can deem this inferior to T2, nobody will deny the atmosphere is superior with the original.\n\nThe atmosphere is dark, filmed mostly at night in bleak and deserted areas of Los Angeles, with a music score by Brad Fiedel which will make the hair stand on end! You won't raise a smile either watching this, it's an intense rollercoaster ride from beginning to end. It doesn't make you jump like todays horrors, it in fact induces a slow feeling of dread, especially as the Terminator says very few words throughout the film and gives you the overall impression that it is one very evil thing that just wants to kill it's target no matter what..and that is scary!\n\nIt's a good story too, because it's original. Apparently it came to director James Cameron in a dream, in the same way as Yesterday did with Paul McCartney.\n\nI'm not going to nitpick that Camerons depiction of the future was a bit off, because that's missing the point, it's a truly monumental moment in cinema history, and every sequel owes itself to this."

It's not a good movie, as people seem to believe.\n\nI have not watched it till 2024, even though I've seen the sequel multiple times and really liked it. One of the reasons was that original 1984 film was not popular on Russian TV, and it a few times, that I did see it in TV program was at very late hours, like after midnight, when I was sleeping (normally). So I finally got a chance to watch it and see what's the fuss all about.\n\nIt's not good. The modern term would be \"cringy\". Yes, I know that it's supposed to be \"creepy\", since this is a horror/thriller, not an action movie, like all the sequels. But it's not \"creepy\", it's \"cringy\". Poor actor performance, poor sound (although that may be understandable considering age and low budget), not that gripping of a story, really.\n\nLooking back at what other movies I saw as a kid, I can understand why \"The Terminator\" might have been seen as a good one in 1984. It definitely has a bit more attention to details and somewhat better atmosphere compared to a lot of B-movies of the time. The premise was unique, too, so no surprise why it affected the industry the way it did. But if you watch it today and think that this is \"the best sci-fi movie ever\", you are probably even older than me and looking at it through nostalgia glasses.\n\n\"The Terminator 2\" became more popular and affected the industry even more, becoming a meme, exactly because it was a better movie. It has its own things, that one could criticize, including the fact it went the \"action movie\" route, but action-oriented story-telling simply works better for the premise. \"Horror\" suits \"Alien\" or \"Predator\" waaaay more, because you need to survive while being hunted by a creature, that you can't predict at all, and that has \"superpowers\" in one way or form (unique physiology or unique tech). Terminator, though... Yes, he is tough, he definitely can be a challenge, but not the one that would make you hide holding your breath: you will hide from his bullets while you are reloading instead."

Here his talent and experience paid off with this breakthrough film, truly a model action picture with its unflagging pace and intensity level. It moves forward quite well while also remaining coherent, telling an interesting story that owes a debt to not only the works of Harlan Ellison, as is credited at the end, but Michael Crichtons' \"Westworld\". Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers a credible star performance as the title character, a cyborg sent to 1984 from the future by an omnipotent artificial intelligence. It wants to ensure that its primary human enemy, a man named John Connor, is never born, so the terminator is sent back in time to assassinate his mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton). Fortunately, a protector for Sarah is also sent back, a sensitive soldier named Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn). Reese will have his work cut out for him not only trying to keep Sarah alive, but convincing her that his wild sounding story is indeed reality. \"The Terminator\" has incredible atmosphere, in both its present and future scenes, and has some wonderful eye popping visuals, not to mention fantastic special effects work by Stan Winston. Brad Fiedel's music score is catchy and iconic, but sounds even more haunting and effective when it's done as a simple piano melody. The editing (by Mark Goldblatt), art direction (by George Costello), and cinematography (by Adam Greenberg) are all first rate. The movie does date itself in certain ways (fashion styles and music), but that merely adds to the appeal in this viewers' humble opinion. It's also not wall to wall action, as it takes some breathers here and there, and is really quite touching in some of its quieter moments. The casting is spot on all the way down the line. Schwarzenegger is perfect as the relentless killing machine, especially as the role doesn't require a lot of dialogue, the under-rated Biehn does a nice job of selling his character and the material, and appealing Hamilton does a fine job with her character arc as Sarah changes from being kind of a mousy person to being more take-charge. The excellent supporting cast features such reliable people as Lance Henriksen (who's a hoot), Paul Winfield, Rick Rossovich, and Earl Boen, and there are some wonderful bits for Bill Paxton, Brian Thompson, and Dick Miller. Cameron and co-writer / producer Gale Anne Hurd inject the film with a decent dose of humour (such as the terminator cycling through various possible responses to a question) that never becomes too prevalent. \"The Terminator\" is simply one of the best films of its kind, and its impact on pop culture (including Arnolds' best known cinematic one-liner of them all) is undeniable. A must see for sci-fi and action lovers. Followed by three sequels and the 'Sarah Connor Chronicles' TV series. 10 out of 10."

Sarah is helped by a soldier from the past, a futuristic visitor, Michael Biehn, who will eventually fell in love with her. Both of whom have to find a way to escape from the invincible Terminator who will stop at nothing to chase her .\n\nExhilarating and nail-biting original film based on a story by Harlan Ellison and script by Gale Anne Hurd, that caused a famous and boxoffice franchise. Adding a prolonged climatic final sequence full of noisy action and violence that is considered to be one of the best of film story. Here Arnie is a cold-bloded cyborg who will stop at nothing to get his target : Kill Sarah Connor, he utters one now popular line : I'll be back, that has passed into movie legend . This is one of the brightest and better films action films of the Eighties. Arnold Swarzzeneger dominates the movie in a stiff and wooden action, in Mr T style. There are nice secondaries providing brief interpretations as Paul Winfield, Lance Henricksen, Rick Rossovich, Bill Paxton, Brian Thompson, Dick Miller, among others. It packs a repetitive musical score by synthesizer and composed by Brad Fievel, including the classic leit motif. As well as adequate and atmospheric cinematography. The motion picture was compellingly directed by James Cameron, and it became a a worldwide megahit, the same as the extraordinary sequel, Terminator 2 Judgement day, also made by James Cameron.\n\nThe popular franchise is formed by the following ones : The Terminator 1984.

Yeah, it doesnt have the special affects we have now, but man, it's still an amazing movie. Now a days. A lot of the action movies or sci fi movies, rely mostly on special effects. This movie, while it has special effects (for the 80s), is all story and character. The special affects are the back bone. Which is rare."

The reason for this is that her continued existence is a direct threat to a collection of intelligent machines who want to destroy all mankind. So, to prevent this assassination from happening, a warrior named \"Kyle Reese\" (Michael Biehn) also makes the perilous journey through time to act as Linda's bodyguard. The problem is that the Terminator is nearly invincible and he will stop at nothing to accomplish his mission. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this was a pretty good action film which should certainly satisfy most viewers looking for a movie of this sort as it consists of almost nonstop mayhem from start-to-finish. Admittedly, it does have an 80's quality to it, but even so, I enjoyed this film for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Above average."

        "review_detailed_main": "I start with cons, cause there are too many. During watching i felt indifference. I didn't spent any time with each of characters(i don't really know them) so how can i be with them, share their emotions? All we know and see is kinda formal, Kyle emotional speech(on nature, in the morning) feels like outta nowhere. And also this 2 minute instant love looks strange. I can't relate to Sarah also because she don't act rational, she kinda simple and not really smart(okay, maybe it's my personal reasons), but do not forget about what i said before \"we do not really know these characters\". Well, if Kyle as simple as he looks, we can assume that we know him, but again, we have no idead about the certain events of his life, we didn't see him much among people to grasp his full personal portait. And even when we see the future, we are not that impressed by effects of that time to fully believe in dangers of war, moreover it looks both boring and unreal(in sense that you don't feel like it is happening for real), very much like action scenes. Lore is kinda simple and not intriguing. So we can come up with the conclusion that this movie has not many things to offer to the viewer. But now to the pros: shooting is quite good, Arnold acting Terminator is convincing(though it is not a simple role), overall acting is authentic, we do not just hear that Kyle is a soldier but we see every aspect of it( war flashbacks, raws, his slim body, his fighting skills, he is not afraid, he don't really pays attention to his wounds(and also not used to think abouth not critical pain), when soldier from future can knock out policeman without using hands), Terminator looks terrifying, decorations is good, movie itself aged not bad(unlike Star Wars 1 or 4 or any before the new ones). So, for the attention to details and caring i'll give it additional star, but i can't rate this film any high. If you not that of true cinematography lovers or art lovers, yeah, many people say the are, but, in fact, nearly no one is. If you think that Nolan Batman movies are good, you probably like it very much, but actually it just reflects your absence of atteintion and taste(no offense, but more or less my ratings and reviews(my approach to rate and review) aimed on minor audience that wanna see something really outstanding, or unconventional or spent their time not bad in the worst case). But here is the thing, Terminator 1984 as enetertainment or let's say \"good time spent\" and it is not art."

        "review_detailed_main": "Being a pre-teen back in 1984, it was inevitable not to get familiar with all the action movies of the 1980's. And the 1984 \"The Terminator\" starring none other than Arnold Schwarzenegger definitely was one of the biggest action movies of the mid-Eighties.\n\nI am very sure that everyone is familiar with the \"Terminator\" franchise and the plans of Skynet. But for those of you not yet familiar with the franchise, this 1984 movie, which started it all, is about a cyborg (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) sent from 2029 back in time to 1984 where his mission is to terminate Sarah Connor (played by Linda Hamilton), whose unborn son will lead humanity in a war against the machines. But the humans of 2029 has managed to send back a single soldier (played by Michael Biehn) to prevent this from happening.\n\nThere, essentially the entire story wrapped up with a handful of words. Despite its simplicity, then there are layers underneath the storyline which adds lots of flavor and detail to the story and the universe of the \"Terminator\" franchise. Things which will come to be realized and utilized in the later movies.\n\nFor a 1984 action movie then \"The Terminator\" was just off the charts. It had great special effects, heaps of non-stop action, and best of all it had Schwarzenegger. It has all the ingredients that a good action movie need in order to be successful. And you must agree that the \"Terminator\" franchise has been successful throughout the years since 1984.\n\nDirector James Cameron does what he does best here, and that is putting together a riveting action movie that grabs the audience by the you-know-whats and doesn't let go before the end credits start rolling. James Cameron really has a talent for memorable action movies.\n\nThe cast in \"The Terminator\" also really had a lot of credit due for the success of the movie. Anything that Arnold Schwarzenegger touched in the mid-Eighties was bound to be an action success. And alongside him in this 1984 movie stood Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton, both of whom put on equally good performances and held the level of Schwarzenegger formidably.\n\n\"The Terminator\" is one of those types of action movies that never grow old. Sure certain effects are hopelessly outdated by what Hollywood dish out today, but they were really great back in 1984. And the effects do serve their purpose well enough, especially given that this movie is driven by a mixture of story, character and effects.\n\nLots of action and lots of one-liners, \"The Terminator\" is an entertaining movie that is well-worth spending 107 minutes on watching."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Terminator,\" directed by James Cameron, is a landmark in the science fiction genre, blending action, suspense, and innovative special effects to create a gripping narrative. Released in 1984, the film introduces us to a dystopian future where machines have taken over the world and sends a relentless cyborg assassin, the Terminator, back in time to eliminate Sarah Connor, a seemingly ordinary woman who holds the key to humanity's survival.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger delivers an iconic performance as the unstoppable Terminator, bringing a menacing presence that perfectly contrasts with Linda Hamilton's portrayal of Sarah Connor. Hamilton evolves from a vulnerable waitress to a determined survivor, setting the stage for her character's transformation in the subsequent films.\n\nThe film's success lies in its tight pacing and relentless tension. Cameron masterfully builds a sense of impending doom, making the audience feel the stakes with every chase and confrontation. The practical effects, particularly the Terminator's endoskeleton, are impressive and have aged remarkably well, adding to the film's enduring appeal.\n\nWhile some aspects of \"The Terminator\" may feel dated, its core story and groundbreaking execution remain influential in the sci-fi genre. It's a must-watch for fans of action and science fiction, offering a thrilling ride that still resonates today."

        "review_title": "Relevant more than ever",
        "review_detailed_main": "30 years down the road, James Cameron's \"The Terminator\" remains an enthralling science fiction thriller, perhaps now more relevant than ever. By now nearly everyone would have heard about how Cameron miraculously made such an excellent film on a miniscule US$6 million budget or so, or perhaps how the eponymous character turned bodybuilder- cum-actor Arnold Schwarzenegger into literally Hollywood's next big thing. It is a testament to Cameron's genius into crafting his unique vision despite and because of his budget limitations, and perfectly casting his stars to suit said vision.\n\nWe all know the drill by now, so let's talk quality. Linda Hamilton portrays Sarah so well as a normal young woman, confused by this sudden chain of events, that she has logically no choice but to buy into Reese's story. Michael Biehn fits Reese to a T with a gruff yet youthful look, a perfect look for a determined soldier fighting a war he wants to end badly, despite his limitations. Though it's under a relatively short amount of time, Cameron takes his time for the audience to really get to understand both Sarah and Reese's predicaments \u2013 to have characters to root and care for, to see them find a way out despite the odds. And a romantic twist is added by Cameron that surprisingly doesn't feel forced, yet somehow perfectly (and ironically) completes the time travel loop that secures John's existence. We're dealing with a romance that transcends both time and space, and Cameron handles it so well, he would revisit these romantic traits with greater detail in his future megalith \"Titanic\".\n\nWhat makes the film work more than it should is Cameron's genius in casting Schwarzenegger as The Terminator. A former Mr. Olympian, Schwarzenegger is renowned for his sculpted body \u2013 straight out of a Greek stone garden \u2013 more than his acting prowess. No matter, his manner of speaking less, and frighteningly intimidating stare clearly unnerve the hell out of audiences, and they still do today. Say what you will about Schwarzenegger's career as an action icon/live-action meme, the man still has a stare that can kill. His strong, iconic Austrian accent works wonders with the machine-like delivery that Cameron was intending. With Schwarzenegger's casting, the stakes are higher for both Sarah and Reese to escape this monstrosity.\n\nBecause time-travel is involved and explained in an easily digestible way (physics be damned), and because Cameron directs with such efficiency and confidence it might as well be made today, the film has aged exceptionally well despite some cornball stop-motion effects that show off its low budget \u2013 all due praise to the late Stan Winston though for his remarkable, if not grotesque, make-up effects and design that add to the sheer horror aspect of the film. It is a testament to Cameron's genius that he has managed to combine great talent both in front of and behind the camera, into creating one of the seminal and memorable films of the '80s decade, and one that will spawn a successful sci-fi franchise with a dedicated fanbase. Make no mistake that the basic framework of \"The Terminator\" essentially represents a B-movie at its surface (Cameron did tutor under B-legend Roger Corman, after all), but Cameron pulls off more tricks up his sleeve. There is a lean, mean atmosphere that permeates each scene throughout, making 1984 Los Angeles seem like a lurid fever nightmare, but that's secondary compared to the hellish, poverty-stricken future he has envisioned for us humans. Brad Fiedel's metallic, iconic score seeps through every alley and night- painted street with a sense of dread and gloom, the synthesized, electronic score complementing Adam Greenberg's cyan-tinted, industrial cinematography to make it feel all the more nightmarish.\n\nMost people back than would have balked or be amazed at a wireless internet connection for everyday use, as if we are surrendering our will to technology for it to take over our lives. And I'm seeing it being endorsed in many a commercial or article. Is the development of technology a bad thing? Not at all. But a good servant can be a bad master, especially if left out of control. Cameron had a fear of that, saw the vision, and ran with it all the way. If we were to leave our household chores to artificial intelligence, or the military leaving unmanned drones to scour the battlefield, what's there to say that eventually artificial intelligence would be used to secure nuclear weapons? Or that they might even become sentient - Cleverbot and Siri may be precursors to Skynet, and Japanese technology is developing robotic humanoids that can deduce for themselves in the near future. The war shown in the film may take place in 2029, but Judgment Day can still happen. Better never than late, I say.\n\n\"The Terminator\" may be surpassed by its immediate successor in terms of scale and action sequences, but this is a leaner, meaner film, and its initial allegory remains superior and more clear-cut; in the realms of science fiction it remains unmatched, as a bleak reminder of the future and technology gone wrong, perfectly represented by its unstoppable, merciless eponymous monster of a character, but also that of humanity's undying spirit to create their own fates. Cameron might have come a long way since then, having helmed two of the most expensive and highest- grossing films in history back-to-back with some truly groundbreaking visual effects technology implemented in both, but this only highlights his original, cautionary vision for the future, one that we are all far too willing to embrace wholeheartedly."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Terminator is definitely one of the best Science fiction films ever made. A lot of people argue on which film is better Terminator 1 or Terminator 2, but in my opinion the first Terminator film is the better film. Although Terminator 2 (also 3) were fantastic films with better action scenes and special effects than the first Terminator film, what I prefer about the first Terminator film is the good acting,(especially by Kyle Rees/Michael Biehn) sense of depth and storyline that the other two sequels lacked. What all three Terminator films had in common were that they had elements of Science Fiction and action in them, but what the first Terminator film had that the other sequels didn't have was that it had a romance element. The romantic side of this film is how Kyle Rees travelled back in time to meet Sarah Connor(to save her from the Terminator) and falling in love with one another, while conceiving their son John Connor during their short time together. This film is quite similar to the film 'Somewhere in Time' with Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour for that film is also about a man who travels back in time to be with the women he loved.\n\nThe whole concept of how Kyle Rees was sent back in time from the year 2027 to the year 1984 to save Sarah Connors life from the Terminator and then impregnating her with John Connor (the Future Saviour) is a mind boggling concept. Where does it all begin and end? If Kyle Rees from the future didn't go back in time to the year 1984, John Connor would never have been, but yet it makes absolutely no sense WHATSOVER, that Kyle Rees could be his father considering the peculiar circumstances - however he was his father for unexplainable reasons. The story just goes round and round in circles. In answer to how John Connor was Kyle Rees' son was that the original John Connor from the year 2027 wasn't Kyle Rees' son as he was somebody elses son. When John Connor sent Kyle Rees to the year 1984 to save his mothers life from the Terminator, Kyle Rees accidentally corrupted history by impregnating Sarah Connor with their son John Connor, who of which wasn't the original John Connor. When Sarah Connor found out that she was pregnant with Kyles son, she mistakenly assumed that her unborn child was the saviour John Connor from the future - when he wasn't. The real John Connor would have been a son that she would have had with another man(In a different parallel universe) who of which was never born, for Kyle Rees prevented her from meeting him because he changed history by telling her about the future - as this somehow prevented her from meeting the father of the real future saviour John Connor and bearing him as there son. Thereafter the alternate John Connor who was conceived from Kyle Rees became the new future Saviour only because his mother prepared him for it and because he wanted to live up to his mothers death wish. Its all quite complicated; the whole sequential repetitive cycle of Kyle Rees going back in time to the year 1984 and then another 44 years passes to the year 2027 and then Kyle rees travels back to the year 1984 is a never ending cycle, as its an infinite cycle that goes round and round in circles forever. The first cycle of the original undisrupted John Connor who sent his Sergeant (not father) Kyle Rees to the year 1984, was in fact the only undisrupted future history cycle that happened. However, every other time travel sequence that goes on and on forever in time travel circles that occurred after that original time travel cycle, was in fact the disrupted time travel cycles with the alternate John Connor in a new and changed parallel universe - this is as explained all due to Kyle Rees accidentally altering history. Considering the alternate John Connor took over from the original John Connor who of which got erased from time all due to Kyle Rees, one could say that the original John Connor never even existed - but yet he did! He lives in the lost dimensions/parallel universe of time.\n\nAs this film is Science fictional, romantic and action based it caters for many types of viewers, whether you're a love-sick girl/ women, a person who is action thirst or just somebody with a good imagination for imaginative people, like myself, do tend to love science fiction films.Anyway, if you haven't seen this film, I strongly suggest you to watch it, for this film is non stop action, has great film atmosphere and had a great and original storyline"

The machines send back a cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to 1984 to kill a waitress named Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) who will give birth to the future leader of the human resistance John Connor. Humanity sends a soldier named Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to protect Sarah from the terminator. But Kyle is only human and therefore not as powerful. It has good action scenes but it's also very much a thinker's movie. It brings up questions like \"Are we going to destroy ourselves?\" and \"Will technology outgrow humanity?\" It brings up these questions which I seem to think about to this day. The best part of the movie is the police station shootout, where Schwarzenegger says the famous line, \"I'll be back.\" Go see it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Fantastic film! my favourite film of the 80s along with Robert Zemeckis Back to the future. One of Arnold's first films as a professional Actor, and his most memorable role. With James Cameron directing, this is definitely my favourite film of his by far. Most people think that Terminator 2 is even better than this one. But for me, this beats it every time. I love Terminator 2, but i thought that it dragged out a lot longer than this film. This film was the perfect amount of time for a film to be running without getting boring. And leaves tension all the way. I used to be inspired by The Terminator when i was younger, and I'm pretty sure it was my favourite film at one point. Arnold Schwarzeneggar does such an amazing job as the Terminator, it's unbelievable. I know James Cameron tried to make him look cooler as the guardian in Terminator 2, but in this film to me is as cool as you can get. With supporting acts of Linda Hamilton (Sarah Conner) and Michael Biehn (Kyle Reese) the whole film is a complete blow-out! Schwarzeneggar was perfect for the role of The Terminator, with the size that he is, the one thing i didn't like with Terminator 2, is that he was the half the size he was in the first one. I know it was 7 years after the first one, and he had stopped bodybuilding, but still i think he should have been the same size as in the first one for playing a Terminator. With Terminator 2, it had a clever concept, and is probably the most well though out Terminator movie of them all, with Robert Patric playing a new style of Terminator. I think the first one if slightly better because it was Cameron's original idea for a film, and plus i think if you are playing a Terminator you need to be a considerably big and intimidating size like Arnold was."

The acting is not exceptional, but nonetheless, the cast certainly does not fail in their respective roles. Every aspect of this movie was well planned, and the great combination of technical features and an overall sound script make this movie a model for all future action films.\n\nAlthough I wish they explored other options in fighting the Terminator, I guess that's what sequels are for. The Terminator takes viewers on a journey of constant fear, anxiety, and panic, and it's exactly because of this that The Terminator is a classic thriller."

        "review_detailed_main": "They just don't make movies like this anymore. Terminator, and Alien, sound to the modern ear as some silly summer blockbuster movies, with all the sequels, prequels, cross-overs and whatnot which have downplayed their image. But what many people ignore is that the first two movies of these franchises were pure 80s (approx.) sci-fi gold, and better ; acknowledged masterpieces in general. Even today, The Terminator is original, exciting, scary and pretty damn hardcore from the first scene when the robot encounters the punks, to the succession of cruel massacres perpetrated by the insensitive killing-machine Terminator throughout the movie.\n\nIt is hard to express just how perfect The Terminator is in terms of plot and character development, and chilling atmosphere, which keeps the spectator clinging to his seat all the way. The opening sequences of the movie ; a brief explanation of the apocalyptic future war, the filthy appearances of the two main antagonists (Terminator and Kyle Reese), contrasted with the simple 80s jolly life of Sarah Connor before hell breaks lose, is a lesson in movie making on how to forcefully grasp the audience's attention and involvement. And when you think you can start relaxing, the booming action starts again even stronger, and greater, until the final act which leaves you gasping for air. This crescendo in suspense and horror is found in a later Cameron film, Aliens, which blatantly bears the director's signature style seen in The Terminator.\n\nThe special effects were pretty ground-breaking and innovative at the time (something which can apparently be said for almost every Cameron movie since), but what really pulls it off is the incredibly bleak and dirty atmosphere, and of course the great cast. I couldn't possibly imagine other actors than Schwarzenegger, Biehn and Hamilton for the lead roles. All the secondary characters are also fantastic. The Terminator carries a distinct 80s feel to it which I like a lot. I wasn't born when this movie was released, and was brought up mostly on 90s movies, but I must say that the 80s feeling of The Terminator adds to its \"charm\" (if I dare say so). Nonetheless, it has survived the test of time exceptionally well, it doesn't pass as outdated at all - the climax is still genuinely frightening.\n\nThe fact that Cameron, at the time a newcomer, managed to direct this sci-fi masterpiece, and went on to direct sequels to both Alien and his Terminator which practically equaled if not surpassed the originals in quality, marked Cameron as one of the best new directors of his generation.\n\nThe Terminator is a perfect 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is something of an enigma to me. It comes from an era in the history of film where a lot of really bad movies were made. Especially sci-fi movies suffered a lot of indignities (not counting Blade Runner, Aliens and the two Star Wars movies made in the decade) but also good action movies were quite far apart. For this movie to be a success in both genres is quite something. This is James Cameron's first masterpiece.\n\nActing wise the movie is nothing short of excellent. Arnold Schwarzenegger produced the role that would turn out to be his signature role in the terminator. His acting is wooden, stiff and very emotionless which is of course perfect as he plays a robot from the future and even though he was outmatched villain wise by Robert Patrick's T-1000 in the sequel he is still very memorable in this movie and the \"I'll be back\" line is one of the most memorable of the 80s. Linda Hamilton is great as Sarah Connor and creates a very likable, vulnerable and at the same time strong character and you can't help but sympathize with her. The strongest performance in my opinion is that of Michael Biehn who very unjustly never became a really big name in the movie industry because his performance as Kyle Reese is everything movie acting should be about. His character is both very strong but at the same time emotionally crippled. The way he plays the role with the exact right amount of desperation is pure genius. Lance Henriksen is critically underused in his role and unfortunately doesn't have enough screen time to really create a lasting impression and that's a shame.\n\nThe effects and action sequences are remarkably well construed, breath taking and exciting. James Cameron proves that he has a flair for action with this movie and even though the effects are dated they still somehow hold their own in a time where computer effects are dominating action movies. Especially the ending is very thrilling mainly because of the editing which basically makes the ending. The stop-motion elements of the movie work remarkably well, once again because of the editing. The film also uses full size puppets molded after Arnold's face and body and because of the lighting (and again the editing) you barely notice the change between real actor and puppet. Brad Fiedel's score has a very 80s feel to it and is practically the only thing that is not timeless about the movie.\n\nAll in all The Terminator is definitely one of the best action and sci-fi movies of the eighties and indeed any age. If you haven't seen it yet, you should. Don't think it's just another Schwarzenegger movie, it is so much more.\n\n9/10"

Everything is just perfectly lined up, telling a very dark story which holds its apocalyptic atmosphere throughout the movie from start to the end. You just smell the 80's all over the film, leaving you in such territory of feelings that today's movies cannot give, they just can't. The time travel concept suddenly becomes one with the movie's antic factor, as this period of our history presented here is no more, even if people are desperately trying to bring us back in time with their nostalgia today, no effort is enough to give us the real feelings as this movie does.\n\n\"Burnin' on the third degree\"; \"You can't do that to me\"; only the choice of music gives the right view to Cameron's sense of conceptualism, reflecting the cool and innocent Sarah suddenly grabbed by an unfortunate, overshadowing sorrow, as the Terminator comes to terminate her for actions that haven't even occurred from her view. Then \"Pictures of you, from another time and place\" puts Kyle Reese into this concept as he held the one and only photo of the woman of importance, Sarah Connor. Besides all this the seemingly unavoidable dark future paints the sonic foundation to the whole soundtrack, its futuristic, robotic, and deadly, but most importantly; overshadowing.\n\nThe story elegantly emerges prior the scenes, built around the dark tension the movie is based on, giving the right informations at the right time in a really fast yet healthy phase.\n\nThe acting is also spot on, especially Linda Hamilton's natural talent manifests itself in any kind of scene, let it be action, drama, horror. This also applies to Michael Biehn, even though there are some almost \"not that good\" acting from his part, however these are rare moments. And of course there is Arnie, with his muscles and plain face, that are quite enough for a part like THE TERMINATOR itself.\n\nWith these elements above Cameron managed to create something so perfectly pure, that it just puts his latter movies look so below class. The Terminator 2: Judgement Day that came after this maintained the quality the Terminator 1 embraced, yet it couldn't remotely bring the same tension and atmosphere that the original movie had, however anything else was brought to the next level by which the movie Terminator 2 - from technical point of view - is still up to date. Terminator (1) relatively has some effects which can be considered out of date, however this immediately drops out of equation as we bring up the artistic quality of its, that couldn't and cannot be outdone by any kind of Cameron's latter productions. And that is the kind of quality that I hold most dearly.\n\nTerminator 1 is easily the best in the series, that can be watched more times than any of the sequels.\n\n9.5/10"

Moments later \"Kyle\" (Michael Biehn) arrives with the aim of thwarting this dastardly plan - and soon the race is on. Meanwhile, \"Sarah\" (Linda Hamilton) is blissfully unaware that she is a target until the news bulletins start reporting the brutal slaying of her namesakes. She is spooked, and takes refuge in a night club while the city's finest head to her rescue. Thing is, Arnie is not just a big muscly bloke, he's a big muscly killing machine - and a nigh-on immortal one at that. \"Kyle\" and \"Sarah\" now have their work cut out just to stay alive while they try to concoct a plan that will destroy her nemesis before it destroys them - and pretty much everyone else it comes into contact with! Aside from the synthesiser music - which has dated quite badly - this film still holds up as a solid and entertaining sci-fi horror film. True, the script is never top of James Cameron's priorities, and here is no different, but the pace of the film and the sparing but effective use of the special effects build to quite an exciting crush-endo that is good to watch with a surprising degree of jeopardy right until the very end. Hamilton is not a very good actress, but as the momentum builds she gels well with Biehn making the whole thing well a worth a watch on a big screen even now, almost forty years on."

There's always something I pick up on every time I see it.\n\nThe Terminator is an unrelenting experience to say the least and the whole premise of this where an almost indestructible machine only has one thing in mind, to kill you, and will stop at absolutely nothing to do it, is terrifying. It is such a simple premise, yet the way James Cameron writes and directs these characters makes this film almost perfect in my eyes.\n\nLinda Hamilton as Sarah Conner is a much more grounded and vulnerable character in this film compared to the badass she would become in the sequel. In fact, she was completely unrecognisable to me once the second film roles on, yet it never feels far- fetched she would become this way because of how good the character development is in this film. You see her gradually become the soldier she is truly destined to be and all of it feels real. Plus, you've gotta love that mullet :)\n\nMichael Biehn as Kyle Reece is terrific in this film and again he also feels like a grounded character. In fact straight away it's impossible not to see the vulnerability of the character when you see all the marks and scars all over his body as he comes through the time portal. He is completely outmatched by The Terminator he is assigned to protect Sarah from so he has to out smart it. You see that life as a soldier in a post-apocalyptic world where man fights machines, is the only thing he has ever known in his life, and there's a lot of great flashback scenes that really emphasise that point so effectively. Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn share great chemistry together as well, I really did buy the fact they loved each other despite the fact they only know each other for a day.\n\nOf course, how could I not mention Arnie as The Terminator. He's another one of those badass villains that has very little dialogue, but you you feel the intensity amp up every time he's on screen. To say he is a presence would be an understatement, he is friggin' scary as a villain because all he cares about is killing Sarah Conner... that's it, that is the only thing he was sent to do and he stops at absolutely nothing to do it. It is just so intense, when you see a scene where Kyle shoots him multiple times, and all it does is buy some time. And it just returns to the deadly game of cat and mouse.\n\nThere are only brief fleeting moments where the film allows you to breathe. There is not a single scene in the film where I felt like it was filler or just there to kill time, it is a tightly edited masterpiece of cinema that just never lets up. It doesn't dumb itself down so that its more accessible to the audience either, there's a good 45 minutes or so where you don't know why this thing is targeting Sarah, or why she is so important and it doesn't matter because the film allows the atmosphere to take over. When she does find out why she's being targeted, it never feels tacked on, forced or drawn out with exposition.\n\nI would not change a single thing about the story or the characters in this film. There are one or two effects in this such as the 'eye' scene are dated by today's standards, but given the films budget was only $6 million, significantly smaller than the blockbuster sequel, there's bound to be a few dated scenes here or there, but it doesn't hurt the experience. There's still something about that final scene with the stop motion exoskeleton that just has my skin crawling. It is such an intense final act, that had me gripped right to the end! It is a filmmaking achievement and one of my favourite films of all time :)"

She talks to Reese about getting rid of Cyberdyne and they get into an arguement about whether or not that is a mission objective and Reese ends up chasing Sarah into a wooded area. I think the beauty of the woods, flowers and waterfalls was important too, because Reese starts crying and saying how all of this is destroyed, and the future is nothing but blackened, charred ruins littered with the skulls of attempted human genocide. What a terrific, powerful scene. I adore Michael Biehn, and I didn't realize what a great actor (and crier) he is!!! Maybe the other \"terminated\" scenes were okay to delete, although they were all delightful. The one where Sarah practices her \"wholesome waitress\" routine was cute. The one where she talks about Disneyland and hot dogs might have seemed silly."

Looking back the special effects weren't that great but at the time it seemed all too real. I think the second and third films lost their way in the sense that the 'baddies' weren't scary (with the exception of Robert Patricks eyes) and too much humour was injected.\n\nWhile the debates continue about Johns age throughout the trilogy, I'd just like to point out the other time \"mistake\" in case some of you aren't aware of it. At the start of the film it stats that it's L.A. 1984. When Reece struggles with the policeman he asks what day it is to which the reply is \"12th May Thursday\" - the 12th of May was actually a Saturday......."

The motion of this film is honestly very mildly wearisome in the way it holds your attention, but it's super entertaining, original, exciting and the 80s' special effects are always worthwhile.\n\nThere's no denying that Arnold Schwarzenegger is the perfect role for this menacing and very robot-like cyborg assassin. He is simply just a cyborg assassin and nothing else. Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn are also very memorable, but mainly because of the concept of their characters; Kyle Reese is sent from the future to help Sarah Connor, and their roles are super fascinating.\n\nOne thing The Terminator does cleverly and pretty much perfectly is set the concept within a short period of time. That's what really adds towards the thrilling tension and keeps you on the edge of your seat, but it's always unforgettably original.\n\nIf you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hard to believe that James Cameron started out with something as small budgeted as The Terminator, and now he has directed the two highest grossing films of all time. Today a lot of people hate James Cameron because he has mediocre stories mixed in with amazing special effects, where as 30 years ago he brought us a very well done story about how technology may overthrow the human race one day.\n\nNow a few things I didn't like in this movie, it is a little bit slow, if you are very impatient you may not like this movie, but if you can get pass the slower parts you will find a really fun flick. I don't see why they couldn't just wrap laser guns in a piece of meat, I didn't see much purpose in following the police chief, he doesn't have much impact on the story, and it can be very depressing at times, and would have been nice to have a little more comic relief.\n\nI love stories that try to warn us about how we can mess up the future, either by government or technology. This film applies more today than it did back in 1984 now that we have Internet, cell phones, iPods and all that. The special effects are excellent, and this movie had a very low budget. The action scenes are good, but nothing groundbreaking, they get the story moving, but they're nothing special. And the characters are all interesting, weather you like James Cameron or not, you can't deny he knows how to make a strong female lead, and Sarah Conner is one of them. She starts out as a waitress who can't even do her job right, then becomes a bada** near the end.\n\nThe Terminator is one of the best examples of how to make a film on a low budget. Both the story, and the special effects are great, the characters are interesting, and it's just a fun movie to watch. It's got a great look to it, and warns us how technology may turn on us one day."

That's how indelible Arnold Schwazenegger is as the title character,a perfectly made HK(Hunter KIller)android who has been sent from the future to eliminate the would-be mother of humanity's fiercest rebel and last true hope.\n\nFortunately for the heroine of this show,SArah Connor(LInda Hamilton,before she beefed into the tough-chick she'd be type cast as AFTER T2,and probably best remembered as a similar,somewhat weaker type character in previous films like TAG and Children of the Corn),said machine has had to waste his way through Los Angeles to find her,so this buys her some time while one Kyle Reese(Michael Biehn,whose career has never completely up-turned since Aliens)also from the future,goes in pursuit of the 'droid AND protect Sarah,thus ensuring the birth of humanity's hero,one John Connor,and protecting humankind's future. As the droid draws nearer and nearer to Sarah and Kyle,and the body count rises,an adrenaline-pumping,gut-wrenching battle between Man's last best hope and a killing machine who\"has no pity,no conscience,cannot be bargained with and will not stop until it finds and terminates its target(I'm paraphrasing here somewhat)\" chugs toward fruition.\n\nI learned not too long ago that director and co-writer James Cameron had NOT planned a sequel(let alone a trilogy or series)of this film and intended it to be a singular ending. Looking back at it as a whole product,it makes more sense(and that's all I'm saying from there so as to avoid any spoilers for those out there who HAVEN'T seen this film or aren't at least familiar with it). I can both understand why this film was only a marginal success when it was first released in late Fall/early Winter 1984: much of the cast were somewhat unknowns at the time,save Paul Warfield(As a doubting yet humane cop) and,of course,bodybuilding champ Schwarzenegger,and the concepts and images of the film were pure Sci-Fi,which always seems to be a bit of a hard sell to the general public. But much like another movie released around the same time,A Nightmare on Elm Street,it was a fairly unique and inexorably memorable movie that was bound to not only have sequels made but practically change the face of the genres they were made in. It's sequels are both well made(and I actually appreciated the whole size and scope of it's 1991 sequel,T2;Judgement Day somewhat better,the best of all three),and I intend to catch the next in the series,should it be made. Since Arnold vowed he was not doing any more movies as long as he's in public office,that could be a while. Still,it took almost twenty years to continue the simple storyline of man's battle with machines who've become far too powerful over just THREE movies,so what's another twenty years? It very well may be back."

        "review_detailed_main": "Given that the world can take this movie completely for granted now, one can forget how gradually Cameron unravels what's happening with the two nude men who emerge one night from a torrent of voltage: One, a colossal Germanic beast, dispatches of a crew of punks to obtain their clothes first thing after he instantaneously regains his orientation. Those clothes, incidentally, should definitely not fit the much massive man, but that's merely one of a goodly figure of plot cavities that I only ever note after it's over: Like several ambitious thriller directors before him, Cameron reveals an exceptional skill at sustaining the action so summarily that this or that inconsistent detail doesn't matter. The second nude, Michael Biehn, doesn't have the same massive figure or imperviousness, but he has the vigilance and taut physique of an animal, stealing clothes too, managing to pinch a gun.\n\nBy this stage we're beginning to note that this smaller man may not entirely be so formidable like the other, as he's conspicuously not killed anyone yet, but we still don't understand how any of it relates to the opening title card describing a war between humans and machines, or why both men have such a concern with the three Sarah Conners in the metro area phone book. It swiftly becomes clear to us which of the three is the one who counts, as we meet her in the form of Linda Hamilton. We see how tedious her life is, with her co-worker observing, in what we don't yet recognize is irony, that in 100 years, nobody will care. Then Sarah finds on the news that someone with precisely her name has been viciously murdered. Thinking little about it, she arranges for a night out with her roommate Ginger while the LAPD, led by Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen, have to manage the second execution-style killing of a Sarah Connor in one day.\n\nWe still don't know what's happening, theoretically at least: We saw the giant man murder the initial Sarah, we're not familiar with the second, and neither man has yet verified himself as trustworthy the slightest bit. So when the smaller man manages to begin stalking our Sarah, we've every cause to presume that he's trouble, and so does she, having by now gathered the murders lead straight to her. She dodges into an ascetically '80s club to call the police and disappear. Two presumably deadly, anonymous, wordless men hunt the same woman in the packed nightspot. At least one now has a substantial arsenal. Eventually, half hour in, one says his very first line of dialogue: \"Come with me if you want to live.\" With hero and villain now conclusively determined, the movie's remainder is utterly a chase, Schwarzenegger pursuing the two humans through LA, slaughter and nothing else on his agenda. I remain unendingly stunned by how superbly Cameron sustains the tension: Unquestionably in that first half hour, there's not one second that's missing heart and soul, when even the essential exposition of Sarah's life is managed with utmost effectiveness. Even in the enormous info-dumps that Biehn is burdened with, we have no sense of the film slumping under the load of it all. When he bothers to tell Sarah, and us, the plot in essence, it comes directly after a climactic point, when we're viscerally prepared for the film to let us decompress.\n\nThere's the cost-conscious way that Cameron shares information about Biehn and Schwarzenegger, ensuring that we'll be engrossed in deciphering who they are. The sharp-witted strokes characterizing Sarah, making her so authentic that we viscerally crave her survival until he can bother to show us just why we should be particularly concerned. Sarah as a convincing, appealing person is much due to Hamilton playing a young woman of no seeming significance pushed into a nightmare and never permitted to find her balance. This is usually the part that feels like just a bookmark, but Hamilton emphasizes her uncommonly distinctive sense of a woman in an '80s killer-stalking-girl flick.\n\nBiehn, never my favorite actor, nevertheless seems a sinewy, astute beast as much as a human. It evokes the frantic anguish of his future life, and makes us pity this tattered endurer. Meanwhile, the epically iconic rogue of the film: It takes authority, and in Schwarzenegger's case, a grand succession of close-mouthed expressions, tweaks of the head. He may be a machine, but he's a convincing one. It's a categorically star-making performance.\n\nCinematographer Adam Greenberg encapsulates a grimy, murky world, scattered by overpowering fluorescents. Stan Winston's Terminator endoskeleton is the stuff of legend, even if some of the animatronics in certain shots are charmingly old-fashioned. Of all the collaborators, still, it's composer Brad Fiedel that merits the most affection: His throbbing, techno-flavored theme leads one of the finest film scores throughout all the 1980s, and it's maybe the best instrument Cameron has to use in maintaining the film's propulsion. It's exciting, dissonant and harsh, that unremitting bass line keeping the movie seeming like it'll never brake, not unless the menace is quelled. Cameron's assurance in his material brings his debut far beyond the standard of all the other films where the screenplay is merely a cause for explosions and car chases: It's a plot with import and desperate interests. Though the characters may be standards, they have persona, and their future is an issue of sincere apprehension."

The action is still suspenseful and the horror elements are still enough to make me hold onto my seat to this day. Integral to its success was the quality acting, story and overall direction. Schwartzenegger as the Terminator is a terrifying villain who is fixed on a relentless pattern but is also volatile.\n\nHamilton particularly gives a memorable performance. Her character's (Sarah Conner) development is slow and organic but from start to finish, it's hard to believe that her character in the beginning of the movie and the character at the end were the same person, but they are."

        "review_detailed_main": "Originally, whilst writing the review for Predator, I thought that was Arnold Schwarzenegger's best role, however, one of my favourite actors of all time was at his absolute best in this movie! A must see for any action movie lovers!\n\nThe film is about a robot sent back through time to kill the mother of John Connor, whom will eventually lead the resistance against the machines in the war following judgement day. The human resistance also sent back a soldier, however, in Kyle Reese, to fight the machine and help protect Sarah, John's mother. Kyle and Sarah must find a way to stop the unstoppable, and this robot will kill everyone and everything in order to complete his machine!\n\nThe film just basically depicts their fight against the Terminator, which is portrayed amazingly by Arnie and actually I do not believe any actor in the world could have portrayed the cold hearted machine better! There are some truly amazing action scenes here, such as the police station, and the brutality of the Terminator is shown from the start when he destroys a group of punks."

It made Arnold and Linda Hamilton stars, and who doesn't love Michael Biehn in pretty much everything he's ever done? It's very easy to look back on it forty years later and scrutinize the issues with the movie, but trust me when I say that I grew up during the time period and the film rocks! I still enjoy watching it occasionally today. Other than T2 which is arguably better than the first, some of the sequels had decent concepts, they just weren't executed well. While I agree that the franchise has run its course and Arnold is too old to do this convincingly anymore, I will always love the first two movies in the series and will watch them whenever they come on."

        "review_title": "Let's Cut The Chase: This Film Is Fantastic!",
        "review_detailed_main": "In order to properly appreciate The Terminator, you have to look at this film and take into consideration the budget that it was made on and the status of the director who created it. Before this film, James Cameron was not the king of the world like he was after Titanic and Avatar broke through. He was a person who very little people had faith in with a film idea that didn't go over very well among the top studios. And if you look at this film from a technical point of view, you can see that they were being conservative with the budget for a bizarre science fiction premise created by a struggling filmmaker who nobody really had much faith in. But in the end, it turned out to be a very good movie with real heart and soul, exciting and suspenseful action, an interesting if unlikely plot, and great performances from Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn.\n\nBut what about Arnold Schwarzenegger? Well, Arnold is unique in this film since he is not really a character in the traditional sense. He is more of an obstacle; a force of nature that cannot be stopped that haunts the protagonists with his fierce demeanor and acute focus on his main mission: to murder Sarah Connor. There is an intensity to his presence on-screen, no small part do to Brad Fiedel's excellent score which includes a foreboding metallic heartbeat every time the Terminator walks onto the scene. And fascinatingly enough, his \"character\" as the Terminator encompasses a very dark fantasy of man: the ability to do anything to anyone without any consequences or anyone being able to stop you.\n\nThe movie hits all the right notes! It starts with a disastrous view of the future before jumping into a dark, disturbing view of the present, with the gritty, dirty streets of nighttime LA providing the perfect setting for a suspenseful chase between man and a murderous machine. It gives us a glimpse of lighthearted humanity as we see Sarah Connor, and ordinary young woman living her life as a normal person, before we are thrown into her nightmare as she finds herself stalked by an unknown assailant with an unknown cause. We feel sympathy for her as she finds herself not only in physical danger but facing the emotional crisis of having the responsibility of saving humanity in the future. And we feel for Kyle Reece, the soldier sent from the future to protect her against impossible odds, as we see him trying to operate in a world that he does not know after growing up in the wake of nuclear destruction. Even the minor characters feel real and human. The only thing \"wooden\" about the acting in the movie would be from Arnold himself, but that's okay because his character is supposed to be a lifeless, emotionless killing machine - and he excels at his role as the Terminator in that way.\n\nBut despite how much I love this movie (I even love it more than Terminator 2: Judgement Day, believe it or not), I can't ignore the fact that certain elements of the film have not aged well at all! Chase scenes that were filmed and sped up to look faster, choppy stop-motion animations on the Terminator endoskeleton, and prosthetic animatronics with plastic skin are just a few examples of how this film shows its age and its low budget. Setbacks like this can take modern moviegoers out of the experience simply because a lot of the special effects look incredibly dated compared to other films, even films that came before this movie like Return of the Jedi.\n\nHowever, in the end, this film comes across as James Cameron's true labor of love. This isn't the blockbuster high-budget mega production Titanic or Avatar. This is the film that got his name well known among the movie-making industry. This was his equivalent to Spielberg's Jaws or Lucas' Star Wars: a film that was so hard to make, but you can see he poured his heart into, and it paid off! You have to respect something like that!\n\nJust watch this film! Do it! Do it now! Go! Leave this review and find a copy of The Terminator and watch it!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The original \"Terminator\" is arguably the greatest sci-fi/action film ever, and the Special Edition DVD finally does this classic film justice. In the future, SkyNET, the supercomputer in control of all military power, decides that humans must be destroyed and begins a massive nuclear war that destroys most of the population. The survivors form a resistance against the computer and its mechanical army, and eventually defeat it, thanks to their leader John Connor. In a final effort to win, the computer sends a Terminator back in time to kill John's mother, Sarah, before he is born. The humans send back a lone soldier, Kyle Reese, to protect Sarah from the seemingly unstoppable cyborg. I think what's so great about this movie is how you're slowly revealed the true form of the Terminator. Piece by piece he loses a chunk here, a chunk there. You know he's a machine with flesh over his endo-skeleton, but the full force of this implication isn't really felt until you see the machine without the flesh emerge from burning wreckage. I find the scene where the endo-skeleton is lurching very quickly toward the door as Sarah is struggling to close it far more terrifying than the whole Terminator apocalypse scenes in the sequels. But then again, those are action movies.\n\nVisually, the film is first rate. Fantasy II's future sequences and Stan Winston's make-up and Terminator endo-skeletons are some of the finest moments in Science Fiction film making. Even in this day and age of CG-everything, the rear projected, stop motion animated Terminator effects are still very good, standing up well in the light of eighteen years of technological innovation. Additionally, for the special edition DVD they redid some of the sound effects, like the Terminator's long-slide .45. There are lots of extras, including deleted scenes, still galleries, and two interview reels with Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron, plus Biehn and Hamilton.\n\nOverall rating: 9 out of 10."

Besides Terminator, we got Back to the Future, Indiana Jones, Star Wars, and more. The Terminator is a welcome addition to that group. Despite the low budget, this movie was a box office hit and a fan favorite.\n\nThis is about a machine who came from the future in order to destroy Sarah Connor so she doesn't give birth to her son.\n\nArnold proves in many movies that he knows how to do action. This must have been the first movie I rooted for the villain. Don't get me wrong, I still sympathized with Sarah. It's just that The Terminator is very hardcore.\n\nOverall, this is a masterpiece by James Cameron. If it wasn't for a semi slow start, this movie is perfect. I rate this film 9/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "The original film in the Terminator franchise from over thirty years ago in 1984. Its funny I've seen all the sequels it spawned (except Salvation) but I had never watched the original. What with the rave reviews from others I thought what better time than to watch. Director James Cameron brought this film to the screen in an era before CGI was used extensively in these films. What you see is mostly real using models, masks and make up effects. Some of these effects have aged somewhat compared to modern movies but the film is still highly recommended.\n\nThis film was one of Austrian bodybuilder cum 'actor' cum politician cum 'actor' again Arnold Schwarzenegger's biggest if not the biggest hit however it spawned an even better in my opinion Terminator 2 in 1991. One aspect that made me laugh was how a character called Kyle Reese (sent back to 1984 from a future world in 2027) confidently says that cyborg technology is invented some forty years from now. By my arithmetic that is only 9 years from now? I can't see it happening! Some of the fashions and nightclub music from the 1984 era seen in the film also made me laugh. The Kyle Reese character is played by Michael Biehn. It got me thinking. What happened to his career? An enjoyable film experience but not a classic in my opinion and for that I award it 7.\n\nBy the way the arithmetic was on the date of this review. (27/11/2015)."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have always loved this film, for well over half my life. I was about 6 when I first saw it, 12 years ago. T2 had always been my favourite film but recently, The Terminator has eclipsed T2 to become my favourite movie of all time. There is so much more to this film than its sequel. T2 is simple action whereas this film is an action, romance, horror and suspense thriller all rolled in to one.\n\nThe Terminator's story is very strong and eclipses every Sci-Fi film there is. The idea of time travel has always fascinated me and, whilst this film does not explore as much as Back to the Future does, the intricate description of Reese going back through time and the bleak setting of the future world is highly imaginative. Cameron does really well at capturing the audience's attention and imagination and shows how talented a director and writer he is. The love story between Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) and Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is beautiful. The idea of a man travelling back in time to protect the woman he loves is so wonderful and sentimental. As well as having a good story, this film is highly entertaining. The TechNoir bar scene, the car chase and the police station scene are especially good and are absolutely stunning to watch.\n\nThe acting in this film is brilliant. Arnie was not at all developed when it came to acting which made him much less human which is very effective when playing a cyborg. Schwarzenegger is not in this film to deliver lines with any power, but is in more as a physical force and someone who appears unstoppable. Kyle Reese is, for me, the best hero ever and he is played by my favourite actor. His intense vulnerability makes him very interesting and the way he is so prepared to sacrifice himself for the mission objective, the love of his life. Biehn is so good in this role as he plays protector very well but does perfectly at playing someone 'lost in time'. Biehn's performance in this film is sadly underrated but for me, it is completely unforgettable. Linda Hamilton is brilliant in this film and her character's gradual transformation, which is completed in Terminator 2, is very convincing. Her ability at appearing terrified is equally convincing. There is also good support from Lance Henriksen and Paul Winfield as the policemen investigating the case. They do well to give the film a touch of humour and their contrasting personalities makes an effective pairing.\n\nThe fact that this film was made on a small budget also impresses me, especially as the special effects don't work out too badly, except for the stop motion scene where the endoskeleton is chasing Kyle and Sarah. Stan Winston is a special effects genius and it is incredible to look at all the films he has worked on. His wizardry at transforming James Cameron's artwork to solid matter is very impressive to say the least.\n\nAlso good is Brad Fiedel's score. Whilst it is simplistic and completely on a synthesizer, it matches the mood of the film perfectly, and is very effective at getting an adrenaline rush. Also, the Terminator theme is a classic tune that will live on in eternity just like the Jaws theme. Tahnee Cain and the Tryanglz make up the bulk of the small amount of songs The Terminator has to offer and like the score, their songs reflect the atmosphere of the film.\n\nAn intensely stylish film that benefits very well from being shot mainly at night to give a real dark atmosphere, Terminator rose above a moderate budget to become an all time classic. The Terminator did a fantastic job at bringing credibility back to the Sci-Fi genre and simultaneously show the importance of a human theme. Almost everyone has seen this film, if you haven't, you really must! James Cameron at his very best."

        "review_detailed_main": "The basic plot of the movie is that a highly sophisticated machine (The Terminator) with extraordinary physical powers that also looks like a human on the outside (Schwarzenegger) has been sent from the future to the present so that the machines can terminate the mother of the only person who can save the human species in the final war between humans and machines that rages in the future world. This is being done so that the 'savior of the human species' is never born, and with that done the machines of the future can win easily. The humans of the future come to know of this plan, and so they too send a human into the present time to stop the terminator from carrying out this plan. All the action revolves around this plot, and all the sequences are brilliantly choreographed, along with superb visual effects and dialogs. The role of Schwarzenegger is so perfectly fitting as 'The Terminator', that it is spooky. This has rightly earned him the nickname 'Terminator' of which he too is proud of. It is this spooky feeling that indicates that this is no simple sci-fi action movie, and that there runs beneath the surface theme of man versus machine, a more fundamental theme of life and death, of 'Eros' and 'Thanatos' than just action and adventure, and that is why this is a classic.\n\nComing to the abstract ideas behind the movie, the idea of 'time travel' is now well recognized as purely fictional and therefore serves as an artistic and imaginative prop or support for other ideas. The core abstract idea is that of an ongoing struggle between mankind and the destructive effects of the reckless use of technology, also unleashed by man, which going 'out of control' threatens the entire human species. So this is actually a metaphysical battle taking place within the human mind at the 'collective unconscious' (Jungian term) level. The 'archetypes' of 'savior' and 'terminator' are again props for this battle between those human minds that through their actions and creative expressions support the sustaining force of life, and those human minds that act mechanically and insensitively, and who by their actions support the 'life terminating' or 'death' force.\n\n\"Our technology has already outstripped our ability to control it.\" Gen. Omar Bradley The key fact or the truth that is not apparent is that machines themselves are not players or 'beings' in this struggle, they are not entities that act themselves because they have no 'volition' or 'will' of any kind, rather machines are value neutral tools that are used either to create or to destroy. And since this core abstract idea cannot be presented or explained very explicitly, it has to take the art form of a movie like this one. (Also compare this to The Matrix). Thus 'The Terminator' is a powerful symbol of the ever increasing potential for destruction unleashed by technology that is bound to occur in the future - the event that can only be extended in time ( 'buying time') by the creative use of technology.\n\n\"Art is a lie that reveals the truth\" said Pablo Picasso. And the truth is that The Terminator will ultimately succeed in wiping out mankind because it is 'designed' or 'fated' to do so. This movie buys some more time for us by it's art."

T2 is very good, but when I watch The Terminator, and I find myself wanting to memorize five or six lines or even write a book about humanoid machines or time travel, I realize that this one is much more exciting and impressive. Besides, that kid in T2 really annoys me.\n\nLinda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger do a good job, but Michael Biehn is the one who does not get enough credit for this movie. However, he was lucky enough to get the best lines by far. \"That Terminator is out there. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear; and it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!\" That line would be good if only said well, but when Biehn says it, it might be my favorite line of all time; and there are several other great lines in The Terminator.\n\nI can't think of one general thing that is bad about this movie. Aside from the afore mentioned dialogue, action, and acting(which includes the actors with smaller parts like Paul Winfield, Lance Henriksen, Earl Boen and Bill Paxton), the plot is brilliant, the music is great, and even the performance and handling of the dogs was impressive!\n\nI used to think that Empire Strikes Back was my favorite movie, but since recently watching The Terminator, after not having seen it in years, I'm pretty sure this is my favorite film of all time.\n\nJeremy Barger http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/firegodsmovieclub"

        "review_detailed_main": "The strangest feeling overcame me when I saw The Terminator again and that is between seeing it last (perhaps in the 2000s) and now it's gone from being an \"old\" film to being a \"period\" film. In fact, like a lot of time travel films, it acts as a perfect time capsule. It feels so thoroughly intoxicatingly 1984 that it's actually quite overwhelming. The cheapy budget gives it this sickly late-night wash which works in it's favour but the thin synth soundtrack hasn't fared so well. It's goes at a great relentlessly linear pace and Linda Hamilton's evergreen Sarah Connor is seriously well-rounded for the time. Apart from... that scene which feels out of another film all together. Still - it's a convincing core of one of the most evocative \"old\" or \"period\" sci-fi franchises of the last few decades."

        "review_detailed_main": "The explosive sci-fi thriller that turned Arnold Schwarzenegger into a superstar is now acknowledged as a cult classic, but it's certainly worth remembering that it did only modest business at the box office. Nevertheless, big Arnie hasn't gone hungry since.\n\nThe plot line of an unstoppable killer robot has become one of the most overused concepts in sci-fi cinema, but director James Cameron has imbued the film with plenty of wit and a relentless sense of pace. Even with today's standards, the make-up effects and the prosthetics are just as terrifyingly effective as they were in 1984. However, this is much more than the usual guns-blazing action B-movie: at the heart of the story lies a woman's reluctance to come to terms with what she must soon face, and the tragedy of a love that can never be."

        "review_title": "\"A serious attitude problem\"",
        "review_detailed_main": "There has long been a tradition in cinema of actors whose good looks or sheer physicality far outstripped their Thespian talents. Of these Arnold Schwarzenegger is in a league of his own. His nickname of Austrian Oak seems to refer not just to his impressive stature but to his woodenness before the camera. And yet he became an icon in the 1980s by managing to get cast in parts which didn't stretch his disappointing range. What do you do with a monotonous voice and a body that looks like it could punch through concrete? You play a robot, that's what.\n\nOh, sorry, not a robot. A *cyborg*\u0085\n\nYes, the 1980s run of hi-octane sci-fi actioners was a boon for Schwarzenegger. The idea of some technological terror coming to get us was hardly new. It was the subject of a lot of 50s B-movies, and if you want to go back further you could include Frankenstein as well. The Terminator is essentially an update of these stories for the then-fledgling age of computers and robotics. It's not the best bit of writing ever. There is some woeful dialogue, and enough logical flaws in the plot to drive a juggernaut through, but this doesn't really matter because the screenplay only really exists to give us a thrilling action adventure. And the central premise \u2013 futuristic warriors battling it out over the life of a present day woman \u2013 provides a strong enough core to build any number of fight and chase scenes around.\n\nThe Terminator was the second feature of James Cameron, and he shows early on a skillful blending of terror and excitement. The picture moves fast, so he doesn't have much time to establish elements of horror, but he is adept at throwing something into the frame \u2013 such as the prominent window behind Linda Hamilton \u2013 to introduce a little note of uncertainty and danger. To maintain the pace, Cameron's tack is to keep the images constantly moving, not letting the tempo down even in quiet moments. After Arnie utters the immortal \"I'll be back\" line, we cut between near identical close-ups of the desk sergeant's paperwork \u2013 an utterly pointless bit of editing narrative-wise but it brilliantly ratchets up the tension before it all kicks off. Cameron also loves to make the audience feel involved, frequently placing us within the action. The first shot in the modern day has the camera underneath the jaws of a monstrous-looking digger. Often characters are seen advancing towards the retreating camera. It's worth remembering that Cameron was of the first generation of filmmakers to be influenced by video games. Not that earlier directors hadn't used these techniques, but I think that idea of feeling like a participant in the action really helped shape his approach.\n\nThe movie looks neat too despite what was a relatively low budget for the era and genre. They have really gone to town on all the tropes of the 80s action movie \u2013 dry ice, blue lightning and alleyways full of billowing newspapers and homeless people. In a way, that contrast between piercing white light and smoky shadow was the 80s equivalent of chiaroscuro lighting. Very often of course it is hiding the clunkiness of the special effects, which are strictly old-school. Personally I love the movie's pre-CGI charm. This really was a golden age for animatronics, even as they were becoming obsolete.\n\nSo, where does Mr Schwarzenegger fit into all this? With The Terminator we have a movie where fast-paced action runs roughshod over logic, and it doesn't call for amazing dramatic performances. Look at the other players \u2013 Linda Hamilton is passable but not amazing, and Michael Biehn is dreadful to the point of irritating. Outside of this movie, both Hamilton and Biehn were better actors than Schwarzenegger, but here it is Arnie who is the most compelling and watchable, simply because playing a hard, mechanical killing machine is the one thing he could do really well. Just for once, he gets to be convincing, chilling, the captivating heart of the movie. Good for him."

        "review_detailed_main": "There are a lot of marvelous reasons to love this. What exactly they are may vary, but I can give you my suggestions for a couple: It mixes a bleak, dystopian future vision with breathtaking, mind-blowing action(and without becoming a film that can't inspire you to think, and that goes for others done by the man who helmed this), and does so extremely well. It is blessed with the enthusiastic and perfectionistic direction of James Cameron, and it shows. The pacing is utterly impeccable. I could not tell you how many times I've watched this. The plot and science fiction are both fantastic, well-thought out, and hold up to thorough scrutiny, I've yet to find a genuine problem in them. The concept is terrifying, smart and thrilling. It all unfolds rather well. The script in general is spectacularly well-done. This never runs out of steam, and in spite of intensity, it doesn't overwhelm, either. All three of the listed genres are masterfully achieved here, and I would agree with anyone suggesting that \"horror\" should be mentioned, as well. The acting is magnificent, the performances are spot-on. Not sure I'd say that there are any exceptions to that. I became a fan of Biehn from viewing this. Schwarzenegger does pretty darn amazing. Henriksen is a lot of fun to watch, intentionally so. Lines are well-written and equally well-delivered. The score is synthesized and is a perfect fit. The music, clothes and special effects(which are almost invariably still incredible) are the only aspects of this that date it any. The guns are tremendously well chosen and handled(read the Trivia to see Arnie's efforts in that area). There is violence and some relatively disturbing sights in this, as well as a little sexuality/nudity, and a moderate amount of language, that can get strong. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the notion of an exciting movie with gun-fights, car-chases, a dark tone, well-done sci-fi, that just might provide food for thought, if you go in looking for that. 9/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The modern classics of science fiction have been able to infuse crowd- pleasing action scenes with truly thought-provoking and clever concepts. From the chillingly violent social commentary of Paul Verhoeven's Robocop to the stylish and brainy conceits of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, few genres are able to balance the scales so well, yet depressingly so seldom. One such classic was unleashed in 1984 under the title The Terminator. It stars well-known action star Arnold Schwarzenegger and is directed by then-unknown James Cameron, and would soon become a world-wide sensation.\n\nSarah Connor is having a bad day. She's late for work, has tons of awful customers to contend with, and has just learned that two women have been murdered; women with the exact same name as her. If I told you that the murderer was a massive cyborg who was sent back through time to assassinate the eventual mother of humanity's last hero, you'd probably think I was describing something less than brilliant. You'd be wrong. The stunningly clever framework that Cameron provides (he also wrote the script) is only one of the many delightful aspects of The Terminator.\n\nSarah has a hero. Also sent from the future, Kyle Reese appears to thwart the Terminator's attempts and protect Sarah at all costs. Through a seemingly unending series of chases, Reese explains the truth to Sarah, and the two of them promptly set off to... avoid the homicidal robot at all costs. Throw in some unfortunate hooligans who unwisely mock the hulking beast, an oversexed roommate, a disco full of mid-'80s dancers and a barracks full of the most unlucky cops ever caught on film, and you have the ingredients for one dark and violent thrill ride.\n\nAs the Terminator, Schwarzenegger (Commando) shines. With very few lines of dialogue to worry about, Schwarzenegger can concentrate on that cold dark stare and a truly menacing presence. Though he's played a hero more times than I can count, Arnold delivers his most entertaining performance ever as the unstoppable beast. Linda Hamilton (Children of the Corn) is strong as Sarah, starting out rather ditzy and weak before displaying some real guts later on. As Reese, Michael Biehn (Aliens) hits the right \"action-hero\" buttons, and while he falters a bit in the movie's more tender moments, that's okay, because Biehn's a cool actor... and the \"tender moments\" last about three minutes in total.\n\nWith one of the more clever sci-fi screenplays of the last part of the 20th century, and some truly exciting action sequences, Terminatorevery bit as good as you might have heard. While many feel that the sequel is the better film, I'd contend that Terminator 2 was merely more expensive. If you're building yourself a digital sci-fi collection, this movie should definitely be on your Top Ten list."

James Cameron really showed his talents as not only a writer, but as a film maker in this classic. The story is fluent, the pace is frantic and is grounded by excellent direction, great performances and good dialogue. The tone of the film is dark and its ambiance is amped up by Brad Fiedel's ominous and percussive score. Stan Winston's special make up f/x are top notch. While Arnold as The Terminator is a focal point and in this role he is perfect, it would be criminal to overlook the rest of the cast in this picture. Michael Biehn gave an exceptional, intense balls out performance here and carries the story delivering exposition while being chased by The Terminator. Linda Hamilton is great too. She shows a lot of range in this film. Lance Hendrickson and Paul Winfield give brief, but memorable performances as cops. There also are some cool cameos from Bill Paxton and Brian Thompson as punk rockers. This movie is a solid production and holds up well. I am not much of a fan of the sequels. T2 is clearly the best of the lot, but after that James Cameron is no longer in the mix and from that point on continuity and quality drop."

Cameron undoubtedly paved a new path and inspired generations, and for that, the industry will forever be in his debt.\n\nReturning to the film, it's a decent mid-80s actioner with enough action and explosions to keep your eyes and mind occupied for the duration.

Certainly not, but you will feel a connection to the plot and the events that take place, and believe me, you will find yourself hooting and shouting for Sarah and her desperate struggle for survival.\n\nThat's what good direction does: it compensates for flaws and can elevate a mediocre script to new heights."

Necessity truly is the mother of invention. Cameron needed to create a masterpiece to solidify his place in Hollywood and in making The Terminator he did just that.\n\nEveryone puts in a stellar performance here and though the special effects leave a lot to be desired today it's safe to say that it doesn't detract from the relentless mercilessness of the killing machine that Arnie portrays. T2 came close to beating this film but for me The Terminator will always be the quintessential film in the series."

At the same time, a soldier from the future, Kyle Reese, is sent to protect her.

Linda Hamilton does a great job as Sarah Connor, showing her character's transformation from a regular person to a fighter. Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese is also good, bringing intensity to his role.\n\nThe special effects were impressive for the time, though some parts feel a bit dated now. The action scenes are well done, especially the final chase and showdown. The film's dark, gritty look adds to the overall mood and makes the future seem really bleak.\n\nWhat I didn't love was some of the dialogue. At times, it felt a bit cheesy and predictable. Also, while the pacing is mostly good, there are a few slow moments that could have been tighter.\n\nOverall, The Terminator is a solid sci-fi action movie. It has a great concept, strong performances, and thrilling action. It might not blow your mind, but it's definitely a classic that's worth seeing at least once."

He plays his role almost PERFECT (hardly any lines, just a cold, rutheless killing-machine). And Linda plays her role exelently too.\n\nThe movies has a lot of everything needed for a good action flick: lots of action, lots of explosions and lots of chasing/stalking (and a tad of love), but it manages to balance in the grey area between too much and too little, making this a true masterpiece.\n\nThe story of a world overrun by 'borgs, using the few remaining \"fleshies\" as slaves can easily get boring, but this movie keeps the excitement up from beginning 'till end...

        "review_detailed_main": "Schwarzenegger; love him or hate him you have to give him credit for knowing what he is and what he isn't. He knows his acting presence is never going to be mentioned with the same breathless awe of Meryl Streep. Arnie does a great job of choosing roles that suit him perfectly. One of those roles is the near monk-like silence of the cult classic killing machine known as the Terminator.\n\nWe can overlook the fact that Skynet chose to send back a Terminator with a heavy Austrian accent to 1980's America because over the twenty or so times I have seen this film I really could not care less. This is probably Schwarzenegger's greatest film. The role doesn't ask too much of him and he plays it perfectly. As soon as Arnie is teleported, crouching fully naked beside a dump truck he is the Terminator. Many people would demean him, claiming it only works because he cannot act. I disagree. Acting is making the viewer believe and whilst watching this film you don't see former Mr Universe, you see an unstoppable cyborg killer would will not stop and not rest until he has completed his task.\n\nWhat works for The Terminator is the simple premise and James Cameron's ability to put a new spin on something we've seen before. He did it with Alien and like it or not he did it with Avatar. The rules of time travel are well worked out and simply explained. Nothing dead can travel back in time (Hence why we get treated to Arnie and Michael Biehn's buttocks at the start of the film). The Terminator itself cheats this rule by being living organism over metal skeleton.\n\nPerhaps most striking about this film, given that it was made in the action hero 1980s where machine gun wielding bodybuilders was the norm, is that the hero character is female. Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is now an icon. She's not the atypical screaming woman who's running up the stairs instead of out the door. She's a normal woman, working part time at a diner, living with a roommate and struggling to find a boyfriend that isn't more concerned about his car. When the time comes, she steps up to the demands of the film. She never thought she could be a hero or brave or fight a cyborg from the future but she does all of these things and the film is really about her and her journey.\n\nMuch of the colour and explanation comes from the haunted but utterly devoted Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) who successfully balances the forlornness of the future with his love for Sarah and determined resolve to protect her. He is the underdog in this fight and it's hard not to root for someone so passionate.\n\nA supporting cast of Paul Winfield, Lance Henriksen and Earl Boen as the psychiatrist add a light-heartiness to a very bleak and depressing environment. It works. Cameron's direction and pacing transition well between visions of a possible future and the unravelling present.\n\nThere is a reason this film was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry a requisite being 'culturally, historically or aesthetically significant'. The Terminator is all these things. It is a film that has referenced and inspired so many others and if it's not on your list of films to watch before you die, then you are a fool."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have never seen Piranha II: The Spawning, and to be honest it's not high on my priority list. So to my way of thinking, this is James Cameron's real directoral debut. And what an opening it is.\n\nTo be just, it really shows its obvious budget limitations at times. The calibre of the action is occasionally lethargic and under-edited, which I'd bet meant there wasn't time or money to shoot and edit more aggressively. For most films, that would be it. But The Terminator has enough brains in its scripting and execution that the film as a whole remains a choice offering. The dystopian theme of the merciless future coming back to haunt the unsuspecting past makes this a deserved classic, and Cameron shows are rare budgeting genius as to what he can and cannot show to keep his audience impressed and off-balance (he knows we'll accept the time travel and the future with minimal evidence, but we'll never forgive him if we don't see the robot under there, so that's where he put all the money).\n\nWhat's more, the actors give it a sense of just plain fun. Linda Hamilton may embody the 80s blond toy look at first, but soon shows herself to made of much firmer stuff. Michael Biehn has never received the attention he deserved after this film. He creates a completely different kind of soldier-hero, sensitive and vulnerable, deadly with the agility of a cat rather than channeling John Wayne. In fact, in the greatest of this movie's tricks on its audience, all the traditional macho hero requirements are fulfilled admirably by Arnold Schwarzenegger the killing machine. It makes one wonder about the spirit in which Cameron contributed to that Rambo screenplay.\n\nIn the final analysis, The Terminator is not to be missed by anyone who presumes to say they enjoy movies. It's a good one."

        "review_detailed_main": "This and 'Aliens' - forget 'Titanic.\n\nCameron is a force in film, possibly as damaging in his way as Speilberg, but with far fewer and less varied films. What he sees and can display must be attractive to judge from the receipts. What he cannot see is less obvious. Here is his first real film, his 'Rocky.'\n\nIn my comment on 'Aliens,' I noted the radically differing styles of Cameron and the man who invented the sexual, scifi horror genre. Cameron starts with the stunts, adds humor and then finds places for the actors and situations. Most work the other way around. Scott starts with a general vision first; for him, stunts are merely punctuation of the visual space. But Cameron starts with a mechanical skeleton, not at all unlike that shown here.\n\nAnd then his strategy is to be relentless in eliminating the human elements of the film: those elements like character development, richness of situation, emotional space. He crushes them just like Arnie's cybergoon, because they simply mess up the cleanliness of his movie. Such 'soft' stuff is for wimps. Any sort of irony or annotation is for eggheads and who needs 'em.\n\nIn the roughly 20 years since this was made, the film world has changed radically with much energy attracted to the Cameron model. The machines in Hollywood are winning. Four years later, 'Die Hard' introduced a simple sort of self-effacing irony into the model and until now that is the only human remnant remaining. It is hidden, and the hardcore action guys often poke fun at it (see 'XXX' vs 'Men in Black 2'). And more, now life further imitates art with Arnie planning run for political office!"

In the case of Arnold Schwarzenegger, it can be argued that his portrayal of the Terminator was the pinnacle of his career, and 1984's film by the same name marked the genesis of everyone's favorite cyborg assassin.\n\nJames Cameron's 'Terminator' was a completely new, groundbreaking story told in cinema. While the special effects are somewhat laughable nowadays, they really were impressive back in 1984. The story itself was pretty pedantic, but that wasn't the main draw to begin with. Instead, it's the mix of suspense, action and Schwarzenegger's delivery of one liners like \"I'll be back\" that steal the show.\n\nBut it's not just the Arnold show. Linda Hamilton gave her breakout role and is able to transform the mostly average Sarah Carter into a tough chick who must fight for her life...literally. The performance given by Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) is sort of overlooked, but should have more reverence attached to it given the amount of screentime he had and the importance of his character.\n\n'The Terminator' is not the best entry in this franchise, but it certainly marked a strong foundation to build on."

It is a shame that such a great ground breaking concept has been slowly eroded over time.\n\nOne thing I do like about the later movies is that they have tried to keep Linda Hamilton and Arnold in the movies. At some point that will no longer be possible and the transition to new actors had been awkward. They set up new actors in the parts and then do not follow through with them which gives the franchise a time limit.\n\nI also have not liked how Linda Hamilton's part has gone from a girly girl learning to be strong to a strong butch character. Hollywood loves to take young new starlets that are America's sweethearts and ruin them. Every single American dream girl has changed into a rough and tough unattractive mess. Linda Hamilton is the worst example of this.\n\nHollywood is more about who you know, what you are willing to do, how much personal freedom you are willing to give up on and off the set than a professional career for an actor.\n\nAdmittedly, Linda has had a few personal problems since childhood so it is even more astonishing that she could play everyone's sweetheart early on. But Hollywood will use anyone for its own monetary gain. With all that, they made a great movie in the first three, and fairly well made sequels that are still mentionable."

        "review_detailed_main": "In 1984 Los Angeles, two beings from the future of 2029 arrive via time travel. One, the T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a cyborg killing machine intent on hunting down Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), who will someday give birth to John Connor, the leader of the human resistance who defeats the machines. The other is soldier Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), who has volunteered to protect Sarah Connor at all costs. At first Sarah doesn't believe the stories Reese tells her, but overtime finds herself trusting him and the two begin to fall in love as they elude the Terminator.\n\nThe second directorial effort from James Cameron, Cameron had made a name for himself on a number of Roger Corman productions such as Battle Beyond the Stars or Galaxy of terror where despite a limited budget and using things like McDonald's coffee cups for parts was able to create memorable locations and impressive visuals. During the production of Cameron's directorial debut, Piranha II: The Spawning (which Cameron has disowned citing the Italian producers interference) Cameron had a dream of being chased by a metallic skeleton which served as the initial inspiration for what would become Terminator. Following a long drawn out production process with which producer Gale Anne Hurd was instrumental in seeing to fruition, the low budget B-rate sci-fi thriller became a sleeper hit in its Halloween debut and ended up doing much better than the high profile killer robot film Runaway despite having a higher profile cast and director. The Terminator is low budget high intensity filmmaking at its best.\n\nMuch like John Carpenter's Halloween, the core of the movie is in Linda Hamilton's performance as Sarah Connor. Much like Jamie Lee Curtis' Laurie Strode, Connor is just an ordinary person trying to live her life despite often dealing with clumsiness, lateness, and forgetfulness at her job as a waitress, but we see a bit of ourselves in Sarah Connor as this ordinary person in an extraordinary situation and the arc she goes through in the movie where she eventually becomes more hardened and has to save herself and embrace her destiny in being the literal mother of humanity's salvation. Michael Biehn is very good as Kyle Reese who plays the battle hardened solider quite well and his drive to save Sarah from an unstoppable killing machine makes a solid protagonist we can root for, and the love that develops between Reese and Connor is very well done. Then of course we have Schwarzenegger as the Terminator known as The T-800. Despite only speaking 17 lines in the movie, the cold robotic tones with which the Terminator speaks during his killing spree make him a memorable antagonist as there's no expression in the terminators face and instead only an intense level of inhuman focus. While the movie does play The Terminator as a threat, the movie still allows for some solid moments of dark humor such as a scene in a gun shop with character actor Dick Miller, or Schwarzenegger's \"I'll Be Back\" which sees its first usage here in what would be a running joke throughout his films and career.\n\nDespite its low budget, director James Cameron creates a solid vision of both the war-torn future and the dark and harsh present. The movie takes place primarily at night and Cameron gives the film that same gritty and harsh aesthetic that Walter Hill got from the Warriors or William Lustig got for his films such as Maniac. The lighting and cinematography is very \"noir-ish\" and makes nighttime Los Angeles a character itself. The war ravage future and its various elements (including the Terminator) are well done with a mixture of composite shots, stop-motion, miniatures, and animatronics to create bleak and memorable sights especially in its climax where the Terminator reveals its true form. While the effects aren't always convincing with some of the composites and effects showing \"seams\" here and there, they're still very solid in terms of what they were working with.\n\nThe Terminator takes a lot of elements and combines them into an entertaining film. While the movie works as a high intensity action film, it's characters and its hinted time travel paradoxes give the film a solid head on its shoulders that compliment the action and effects."

But I guess that happens when you deal with a time travel in a movie. It takes a little extra concentration to get everything straight.\n\nI did, however, enjoy most of the film. The action scenes were well-choreographed and the tension was high during the Terminators' ruthless massacre. The acting was above average and the dialog was nothing special, but good.\n\nAll-in-all, The Terminator wasn't a masterpiece but it was entertaining...and that's all you can ask for I guess.

        "review_detailed_main": "Rating-7/10\n\nThe Terminator, the name emits a kind of weird thought of Arnold Schwarzenegger or maybe the name John Connor(usually pronounced in an Austrian accent). Whatever Terminator themed thing that comes to mind, this film will no doubt leave you feeling well enjoyed and engaged, in a way that many action films just fail to do.\n\nThe film is interesting, and again you don't always get that from action movies but the Sci-fi is good enough to combine with the good action to make this exciting and very fun. I found this intriguing in a sense, the story is kind of predictable then also un- predictable at the same time, and that makes it both humorous yet very serious and the suspense is well done too. The ending is the best part about this, this gets better as it goes along and for me the very end is one of the most exciting moments in this entire movie.\n\nYou know Arnie is the best remembered actor of this film, but not for good reason, sure he is good but don't forget about the others here though. Michael Biehn is firm as Kyle and he makes the serious moments, just that bit more serious. Linda Hamilton isn't always great here, probably the weakest of the main \"good guys\" but she still acts kind of well, just maybe not the best for a leading actor. The cast is picked well there is no doubt here but Arnie to be fair is the real memorable person, he commands his scenes and the lines he is given are at times, gold.\n\nNow James Cameron I do feel is overrated here, I know I know how do I think he Is overrated but let me get this out straight, although he is good, as is the film as a whole, I don't think it is a masterpiece. Now Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd create a script that is solid, and it works out well, but I do feel his directing can be a little too, well crash and bang, sometimes scenes get a little too fast and the fighting is too quick to be seen, although all together as said before, he is good.\n\nWhy do I think this isn't a masterpiece?, well it comes down to this, now it is unique it's way of being made however, I watched this years later, I have been influenced by other films, so maybe to fully love this, you'd have to go back to 84. I do though, feel this is special, in a way in which this plot is still to this day, never been re done to a good quality, and I mean that because Sci-fi films want to emulate this, but they can't or people will know.\n\nThe fast pacing of this movie makes this easy to like, and it is important because again, not so many action films do this well or make the action fast but well made(but as previously mentioned, not all the action is seamless). The Special effects are a little crazy at times, when the movie starts to go to the future, the space ships are insane and the props are actually kind of funny, of course effects weren't as good in the 80's so a bit of credit to the team behind.\n\nAll together though I do find this good and although maybe my rating doesn't reflect my full opinion on this, it still tells this is a film nearly everyone likes, even if just a little. It is hard to hate this movie I admit, I mean I didn't try but finding holes in this is fruitless, just sit back and enjoy a bit of movie history."

For a movie known by many for violent action sequences, cyborgs, and Arnold's \"I'll be back\" line, I'm sure many people who prejudge this as mindless drivel will sing a different tune if they choose to see it. This is one of the most powerful, poignant, heart-wrenching love stories on film. It was masterfully acted (Michael Biehn, especially, gives a stand-out performance) and executed by all. This film truly is an experience, and one that left me captivated with all things Cameron."

        "review_detailed_main": "Without doubt, one of the best films ever made in the sci-fi action genre. The Terminator is incredibly atmospheric, with impressive special effects for the era and a menacing score. Schwarzenegger is perfectly utilised and could not be a better fit for the role. Linda Hamilton also gives a strong performance, developing rapidly and authentically from girl-next-door to cyborg-destroyer in a very short space of time. We also see one of the few sex scenes in a blockbuster film that has genuine feeling to it, resulting from a delicately engineered chemistry between Hamilton and Michael Biehn. Compared to the cluttered flamboyant action films that have preceded it, Terminator is clean, minimalist and unpretentious. A genuine classic."

My opinion has always been that T2 is the best in the series and I still believe that although I have enormous respect for the Inaugural movie. Dark. Gritty. Full of action and Undeniably 80's. Lacks the comedy that was gradually introduced in the sequel and taken to ridiculous levels in the terrible 3rd movie. But I think the more serious approach is what appeals to me about Schwarzenegger's first outing as the T101. He plays a brutal relentless killer, emotionless and satisfyingly true to the MO of a terminator. The special effects are of the era. But the movie hits so many good notes that it's easy to overlook the'hi tec' prosthetic's of 1984. Great movie. A Classic."

Or the little love affair that grows bigger even though there's a killing machine going after them. And of course the police sirens when everything's finish. In how many movies have we seen that.\n\nBut still, The Terminator is a good movie. Arnold is very good, even though I can't say the same for Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn. The Terminator is not a classic, but it's entertaining nevertheless. Even though I preferred T2, T1 is deeper (even with all the flaws that the movie contains).\n\nSeen at home, in Toronto, on January 28th, 2005.\n\n78/100 (**\u00bd)"

The music is awesome, the shots are beautiful and, although it doesn't hold up as well as T2, it is still a landmark of sci-fi/action cinema that any movie buff needs to see at least once. Many people may think its kind of slow and the low budget shows, but that does not take away the fact that the Terminator is an insanely well directed, masterpiece of cinema with a story so original it is hard to imagine anyone will imagine anything as breathtaking as the wasteland shown in the Terminator Series. I stand by saying T2 is the best in the series, but it is definitely a close one."

It tells the story of a Terminator coming from 2029 to kill the Sarah Connor, mother of John Conner, the leader of the resistance to prevent him from ever being born. The resistance also sends someone through time to protect Sarah and a hunt ensues across LA.\n\nThis movie is a straight action with a little love story that develops between Kyle, the protector, and Sarah, the protectee. It involves a lot of shooting, killing, maiming and ferocious and disgustingly beautiful scenes (The one where the Terminator fixes his hand and eye using scalpel).\n\nIt has almost no element of drama, feeling and very little humor so I don't really know why I liked it, but I did. This movie is not for everyone, it should only be viewed by the action-freaks, disgust-lovers and the mature in mind with absolutley nothing to do.\n\nThat's about it, too bad I can't get any good quotes out of this movie, all of the best ones are from the sequel, so go see that one too."

Sarah Hamilton also gives the performance of her career and Arnold delivers an outstanding performance in the few memorable lines that he gives. The Terminator delivers not only a action packed, explosive thrill ride, but also a very emotional heart warming scene involving Biehn and Hamilton. This will forever be the most memorable film I've ever experienced."

The story involves a Terminator that is a Cyborg sent back into time to terminate Sarah Connor. The titular Terminator is played by Arnold Schwarzenegger who has minimal dialogs in this movie but is able to portray the ruthless demeanor of the emotionless cyborg perfectly. The film does not dwell too deep into the technicalities of time-travel but the action scenes make up for its plot holes. The director James Cameron rose to fame following the success of this movie and that is because the movie is timeless. A must watch!!!"

A cyborg named Terminator (Schwarzenegger) comes from future to year 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). She will be mother of John Connor, who is a leader of the resistance. The resistance also send their own soldier Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to past. Terminator is very unemotional and brutal assassin. The Plot is very simple. On the other hand it isn't whole truth. There are many other things in the film. The Terminator is very exciting and scary film. A slowly rising tension and creepy music keep you tightly in their grip. Actors are very good. The film raises questions about robotics and nuclear war. There is a tragic romance between Sarah and Reese complementing the film.\n\nI don't find weaknesses. Definitely worth watching for everyone if action scenes aren't problem. 10/10"

What i want to say is this, the Terminator is a timeless classic that is often overlooked due to its far poorer and yet far well known sequel that, from my point of view, should never have been created, if it were to be so infinitely inferior compared to The Terminator. The Terminator could well have just turned into a B-movie, but didnt. The great thing about it is how right from the start to the very end of the music (another brilliant thing about it), it has you at the edge of your seat, your attention never waivers, and no matter how many times you watch it, it just gets better and better. The music is, to put it bluntly, almost the best. The only music in a film that is better is that of The Last of the Mohicans. From my point of view, the music of a film is more important than the dialogue and visuals of a film, and after the first time i watched The Terminator, that music has stuck in my mind ever since (and im glad for it !). The other reasons that The Terminator is so good is its characters. Arnold Schwarzenegger is at his very best in this film, and i still think he has never managed to top this performace. Granted, he said less than 100 words or something, but that doesnt matter. The music and his actions when he was on screen defied any dialogue, and the less he talked, the better he was. The scene in the technoir club and the Police Station \"incident\" are two of the greatest scenes ever. Linda Hamilton was brilliant as the innocent waitress who's boring every day life, being continuously stood-up, suddenly turns into the most important living being on earth. Finally, there is Michael Biehn. Now i thought that Linda should have been catapulted into super stardom, when she wasnt, but Michael Biehns' luck in Hollywood is evan worse. He pulls off a performance that i dont think any other actor could have done. From my point of view, he was perfect. He had the greatest lines and the best character in all the film. You can really feel pity for this guy to say the least, as he seems so small compared to the massive bulk of Arnold, and yet just as Arnold keeps on getting up after being shot up, for a human, Riece does very well, showing the urgency and importance of his misson, as he must succeed. Michael Biehn gets no where near enough credit for this film, and instead of being in the Hollywood A List, hes way down the line. When it came out in the Cinemas', i watched The Rock, it had Sean Connery and Michael Biehn in it, i thought that both of them would have pivotal parts, and was hugely disappointed too see him die almost immediately after less time on screen than Ray Parkes in TPM. This guy really has been literally dumped on. Finally, James Cameron, for a guy who made the most expensive film ever, i have one piece of advice, get back to low budgets, cause this is the best film you've ever made and are ever likely to make. So, in conclusion, if anybody out there hasnt watched this film, watch it, its one of the best."
