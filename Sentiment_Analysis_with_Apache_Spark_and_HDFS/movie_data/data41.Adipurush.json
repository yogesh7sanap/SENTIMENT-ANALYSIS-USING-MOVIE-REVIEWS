        "review_detailed_main": "Adipurush, if one remembers, was supposed to be an modern adaptation of Ramayan and hence the makers chose to have a free run with the creative liberties in this film and it all went wrong .\n\nAdipurush itself starts from the middle of Ramayana where lord Ram was sent to the jungles for 14 years exile . Hence the film doesn't have any build up to any character.\n\nFirst, the characters itself have no introduction whatsoever. Makers assume since we know Ramayana, so no need to introduce anyone properly. Lord Ram is just introduced through some pictures in the opening credit while laxman and Sita ma have even further lower introduction. Honestly saying if one didn't tell you that Sunny Singh is laxman, you probably won't know. Jatayu pops up randomly and gets to poorest adieu . It's almost as if Lord Ram doesn't even know who Jatayu is. Bali , the brother of Sugreev, has absolutely no introduction.\n\nNext, the setting. If it's a modern adaptation of Ramayana, then why is the Lord Ram side shown to be taken straight from Ramayana but Lanka and it's people especially Raavan are shown as people of some Azguard (Thor) ? Clearly there is inconsistency . If you remember the original Ramayana, both Ram and Raavan side had almost similar kind of dresses with kings wearing king like dresses etc. Here, both sides wear dresses belonging to opposite poles.\n\nNext, the execution. It's horrendous. Bali and Sugreev's fight is the worst looking one which gets over in no time without any introduction to Bali. As they fight, you can't even understand who is Bali and who is Sugreev. The part where Sita gets kidnapped by the Sadhu is not accurate. The Sadhu i believe never gave evil smiles . Jatayu's adieu is just ignored. In the earlier Ramayana, Jatayu has a heartfelt conversation with lord Ram in his arms before dying but here, Jatayu is just treated like a random bird. Last but not the least, everything on the lankan side is so poorly executed. Lord Hanuman burns Lanka with his tail but it barely burns, just random explosions here and there that's it.\n\nNext, I want to talk about Indrajith and Vibhishan. My god what kind of portrayal is this? Indrajit looks like a party animal from some Noida club and he possesses powers of Flash !! The level of creative liberties they took!! Vibhishan is so hard to believe he's vibhishan as he doesn't act like him only . They all got weird tattoos on their body especially indrajith . Itna bhi modern nahi karna tha !!\n\nVFX and dialogues. Let's not talk about it you already know how it is. The final war sequence also looks so cartoonish that it sucks the essence out of it.\n\nLet's talk about Raavan played by Saif. He does try very hard to make Raavan look menacing. His character is even given a terrifying bgm . However, the rest things of his looks so weird. His 10 heads rendered VFX looks hilarious at best. His hairstyle is again Noida Gurugram style. He feeds non veg to his dragon vehicle (why is non veg shown in this film at first place?). All these creative choices just don't fit Raavan. The makers have just played around with the Lanka side while fearfully avoiding any creative changes on Ram side .\n\nSongs are good as well as the BGM. That's the only reason I gave this film 2 stars.\n\nPrabhas as lord Ram should never have been there. He's just angry faced , barely smiles and has no expressions at all. His body is an entire VFX render throughout.\n\nOverall, i thought KBKJ was the worst film this year but Adipurush beats it by a mile solely because it has ruined an epic saga so close to all Hindus. Adipurush just shows a part of the entire Ramayana that too with little to no detailing with its running time being 3 hrs and back in 1992, the Yugo Sako version showed all details and the entire tale of Ram in under 2hrs 50 mins. It clearly shows the quality difference of the makers ."

If you keep the story aside for it's largely known to all, the execution turns out to be a messy blend of over-the-top CGI and passable VFX, and making it worse are the intentionally funny dialogues that sound misplaced in a sensitive and mythological story. Why would you want Hanuman to say 'Jalegi tere baap ki'?\"\n\nBetter to watch the ancient Ramayana rather then wasting time on this so called Epic."

I watched it on OTT and the animation is pretty bad at some points in the movie. Sometimes the way arrow was held or generally the forests. Some dialogues felt weird at points but most of them were good and impactful.\n\nThe good part? Yes, there is. The background music is good. Most of the dialogues were good. The way Raghav motivated vanar Sena for war made me teary. You need to watch them to feel the impact. In general the scenes where weapons are used mostly appeared nice.\n\nI became an atheist from a Hindu. I liked that finally we could watch Ramayan in a fun manner, learning it's values. Not just as a religious thing.\n\nIf you are not watching seeing the reviews then please don't do that. This is surely worth a watch.\n\nI actually felt how good Ram was and I should try to be as much as I could like him at the end of the movie."

From the onset, it becomes painfully evident that the film has made some regrettable choices in terms of visual effects (VFX), dialogues, and the overall adaptation.\n\nLet's start with the VFX, or rather, the lack thereof. The movie's visual effects are nothing short of abysmal. The poorly rendered creatures and unconvincing movement leave the audience cringing with disappointment.\n\nMoving on to the dialogues, they prove to be equally disappointing. The use of cheap language, lacking depth and originality. The dialogues fail to evoke any emotional response.\n\nHowever, the most egregious offense committed by \"ADIPURUSH\" is its degrading adaptation of an epic. The film takes the rich source material and reduces it to a shallow and misguided narrative. The characters are poorly developed, their motivations are unclear, and the plot meanders aimlessly, losing the essence of the original story. It's disheartening to witness such a disregard for the source material, as it alienates fans who were eagerly anticipating a faithful and respectful interpretation.\n\nOverall, \"ADIPURUSH\" is a disappointing cinematic experience that fails on multiple fronts. Its woeful VFX, cringe-worthy dialogues, and degrading adaptation make it a forgettable and regrettable addition to the genre. Save yourself the trouble and seek out better cinematic offerings that do justice to the stories they aim to tell."

        "review_detailed_main": "Adipurush, a much-anticipated film starring Prabhas, Saif Ali Khan, and Kriti Sanon, fails to live up to the expectations of its viewers. Despite a promising premise and a talented cast, the movie falls short in multiple aspects, leaving the audience unsatisfied and disillusioned.\n\nOne of the major letdowns of Adipurush lies in its character development. Prabhas, known for his charismatic presence on-screen, fails to justify his role as the protagonist. His performance lacks depth and fails to evoke the necessary emotions that could have brought the character to life. Similarly, Saif Ali Khan and Kriti Sanon also struggle to make a lasting impact, as their characters feel underdeveloped and fail to leave a lasting impression.\n\nAnother glaring issue with Adipurush is its screenplay and dialogue. The film relies heavily on overhyped and low-impact dialogues that do not resonate with the audience. The lack of impactful writing makes it difficult for the viewers to connect with the story or the characters, leading to a sense of detachment throughout the movie.\n\nFurthermore, the visual effects in Adipurush, touted as one of its strengths, turn out to be lackluster. The CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery) feels unpolished and fails to seamlessly blend with the live-action sequences. The result is a jarring and unconvincing visual experience that takes away from the overall immersion in the film.\n\nThe filmmakers had the opportunity to elevate Adipurush by focusing on simplicity and utilizing a more accessible language. However, they missed the mark by overcomplicating the narrative and using convoluted storytelling techniques. As a result, the movie becomes unnecessarily convoluted and difficult to follow, leaving the audience feeling disconnected and perplexed.\n\nIn conclusion, Adipurush is a disappointing film that fails to capitalize on its potential. The lackluster character development, underwhelming performances, weak dialogue, and unimpressive visual effects contribute to its downfall. While it had the ingredients for success, the execution falls short, resulting in a wasted opportunity. Ultimately, this movie fails to leave a lasting impact and will likely leave viewers feeling unsatisfied and unfulfilled."

        "review_detailed_main": "As an avid moviegoer, I had high hopes for Adipurush, especially with all the buzz surrounding its release. However, after watching it, I can't help but feel utterly let down. Adipurush is a prime example of a film that fails to live up to its enormous hype, and it falls flat in nearly every aspect.\n\nFirst and foremost, the screenplay is an absolute mess. The story lacks coherence and fails to engage the audience from the beginning. The pacing is all over the place, making it difficult to connect with the characters or understand their motivations. It feels like the scriptwriters were more interested in creating visually stunning scenes rather than crafting a compelling narrative.\n\nThe performances in Adipurush are equally underwhelming. The lead actors deliver lackluster performances, failing to bring depth or emotional resonance to their characters. Their dialogue delivery feels forced and unnatural, making it challenging to empathize with them or invest in their journey. Even seasoned actors seem lost in their roles, unable to salvage the poorly written and developed characters.\n\nAnother major letdown is the film's visual effects. Considering the massive budget allocated to Adipurush, one would expect cutting-edge special effects and breathtaking action sequences. However, what we get is a subpar display of CGI that looks artificial and unconvincing. The battle scenes lack intensity and fail to generate any excitement or thrill. It's a missed opportunity to create awe-inspiring visuals that could have elevated the movie.\n\nFurthermore, the direction and editing leave much to be desired. The director seems unsure of the tone and style of the film, resulting in a disjointed and inconsistent experience. Transitions between scenes are jarring, and the overall flow of the movie feels disjointed and confusing. It's as if the filmmakers were more concerned with style over substance, neglecting the basic principles of storytelling.\n\nUltimately, Adipurush falls short of its lofty expectations. With a weak screenplay, uninspired performances, lackluster visual effects, questionable direction, and forgettable music, it fails to deliver on any front. It's a disappointment for fans who were eagerly awaiting a grand cinematic experience. Save your time and money and opt for other, more deserving films instead."

        "review_detailed_main": "Adipurush, directed by Om Raut, is an epic retelling of the revered Hindu mythological tale, the Ramayan. With its perfect casting, melodic music, incredible graphics, and breathtaking war sequences, the film successfully captivated me. Adipurush showcases the journey of Lord Ram, portrayed impeccably by Prabhas, and highlights his heroic exploits in the battle against the formidable Ravan.\n\nOne of the film's standout aspects is the perfect casting of Prabhas as Lord Ram. His demeanour exudes the noble qualities and righteousness that the character demands. Prabhas's screen presence and dedication to his role elevate the heroism of Sri Ram, making his character truly engaging and inspiring.\n\nThe melodic music of Adipurush adds depth and emotion to the storytelling. The film's soundtrack beautifully complements the narrative, enhancing the audience's connection with the characters and their journey. The songs and background score resonate well with the mythological theme, providing a rich and immersive experience.\n\nIndian makers have left no stone unturned in creating incredible graphics and visually stunning war sequences. The grandeur and attention to detail in these scenes are truly commendable. The battles are choreographed and executed with precision, making them a spectacle to behold. The Indian film industry showcases its technical prowess through the impressive visual effects, which enhance the mythological elements of the story.\n\nAdipurush does justice to the important episodes of the Ramayan, whether it's the encounter with Jatayuvu, the meeting with Shabari, or the iconic scene of Hanuman burning Lanka. Each episode is beautifully shot, capturing the essence and significance of these moments. The attention to detail and the portrayal of these episodes add depth and meaning to the overall narrative.\n\nThe film presents a strong portrayal of Ravan, who serves as the antagonist to Sri Ram's heroism. The character of Ravan is depicted with depth and complexity, showcasing his power and intelligence. This adds to the overall conflict and raises the stakes for Lord Ram, creating a compelling dynamic between the two characters.\n\nHowever, one of the drawbacks of Adipurush is that most of the sequences are shot in dark settings. While this might add to the intensity and mood of certain scenes, it results in a lack of colorful skies, vibrant flowers, and visually appealing clothing. This absence of vivid colors can make the film feel somewhat monotonous visually, especially considering the grandeur and beauty associated with the Ramayan. Most negative reviews are nit picking, ignoring the larger picture.\n\nIn conclusion, Adipurush is a visually stunning and emotionally captivating retelling of the Ramayan. Prabhas delivers a remarkable performance as Lord Ram, and the film's music, graphics, and war sequences leave a lasting impact. While the dark settings might be a drawback for some viewers, the overall experience of the film is engrossing, and it successfully brings to life the epic tale of good versus evil. I am no big devotee of Sri Ram but this elevated my reverence for him. I am proud that an Indian has made such an epic film. Adipurush is a must-watch for fans of mythology and epic storytelling."

You have a movie that is heavy with CGI and Green screen, and it's not good CGI.\n\nThe acting and the story is good, some great production design here, music is brilliant and as nearly always, good songs too, just not that many here though. Plenty of action, and use of slow motion is overused, which drags the film on for three hours. A good load of editing is needed, to be sure.\n\nThe motion capture is used quite a bit in this, too much really, and practical effects would of and should of been used here, so there is a lot of style with no substance, hence the problems. Action is not as great as it should of been.\n\nEntertaining as it is, it's flawed and needed polish, but I did enjoy it. Looking at the scores and reviews here, I can understand the disappointment, but I gave it a seven out of ten as it's an different take of 'Troy'. But its' not the epic that it pretends or wants to be. Can say if it's worth seeing, but it beats being bored at home. That's about as fair as I can say."

        "review_detailed_main": "I strongly advise against subjecting yourself to this particular movie based on the Ramayana. It is an extremely disappointing and poorly executed film that fails to capture the essence and beauty of the original epic. Throughout the movie, you will find that the scenes lack depth and fail to engage the viewer, the dialogues are uninspiring and lack meaningful impact, and the characters are poorly developed, lacking the depth and complexity that make them so beloved in the Ramayana.\n\nWhat is truly disheartening is the apparent disregard for Hindu sentiments exhibited by this film. It seems as though the creators intentionally sought to hurt and offend the religious and cultural sensibilities of the Hindu community. This blatant disrespect is not only insensitive but also demonstrates a lack of understanding and appreciation for the significance of the Ramayana as a cherished cultural and religious text.\n\nGiven the numerous flaws and the offensive nature of this movie, it is my strong belief that it should be banned. It is an utter waste of both time and money, providing no redeeming qualities or entertainment value. I cannot stress enough that this film does not deserve even a single star rating. Spare yourself the disappointment and seek out better adaptations that do justice to the beauty and essence of the Ramayana."

        "review_detailed_main": "I recently had the opportunity to watch Adipurush, a movie supposedly based on the Hindu mythology Ramayan. I wanted to take a moment to share my feedback and express my disappointment with the overall execution of the film.\n\nFirstly, I must mention that the departure from the traditional portrayal of characters in Adipurush was quite disheartening. Ravan, a revered character known for his devotion to Lord Shiva and his strict vegetarianism, was portrayed in a manner that completely disregarded these important aspects. This not only deviated from the original mythology but also had the potential to hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus who hold the Ramayan Epic in high regard.\n\nMoving on to the visual effects (VFX), it was quite evident that the film fell short in this aspect. Despite having a higher budget than Brahmastra, the VFX in Adipurush failed to impress. It seemed as though more attention was given to superficial color grading rather than focusing on achieving high-quality visual effects that would enhance the overall viewing experience.\n\nAdditionally, the dialogues in the film were quite disappointing. While attempting to present a more modern interpretation, it felt like the important characters like Raavan and Hanuman were more like goons living in slum areas.\n\nIn summary, Adipurush proved to be a disastrous departure from tradition. The film's misguided choices in character portrayal, subpar visual effects, and abysmal dialogues made it an underwhelming cinematic experience. It failed to deliver on its promise of an engaging and respectful adaptation of the revered Ramayan Epic. As an audience member, my disappointment was profound, and it truly affected my overall impression of the film.\n\nI hope that Adipurush team takes all these negative feedback into consideration for future projects. I believe that with the right attention to detail and a sincere commitment to honoring the source material, it is possible to create adaptations that resonate with audiences and do justice to the rich mythology they are based on."

Also many i.portant part of Ramanaya was not shown such as fight when Hanuman was crossing sea or tail of him enlarged before lanka fire etc.\n\nRole of Laxman was really not considered well.\n\nPrabhas and Kriti acting is good. Even of Saif but direction of movie and dialogs are not ipto the mark."

The Lanka which is known to be Kubers erstwhile kingdom, to be of gold. The Lanka shown here, despite freehand at vfx is oddly black in colour. The casting could be better as charector to cast is starkly juxtaposed. This epic could spread over different series of movies. Every charector has a story and connection to another. Ram, Seeta, Hanuman, Ravan, the war etc. Could have come in phases and created a massive franchise."

        "review_title": "Adipurush: A Disappointing and Misguided Interpretation",
        "review_detailed_main": "Director Om Raut's highly anticipated film \"Adipurush\" promised to be a grand retelling of the epic Ramayan with a star-studded cast including Prabhas, Kriti Sanon, Saif Ali Khan, and Devdutta Nage. However, upon watching the film, it becomes evident that it falls far short of expectations and fails to deliver a satisfying cinematic experience.\n\nOne of the most glaring issues with \"Adipurush\" is its visual presentation. Despite being a live-action film, it often feels like a poorly executed animated movie. The special effects and CGI work are subpar, resulting in unrealistic and unconvincing visual sequences. This lackluster visual quality is particularly disappointing considering the film's large budget and the potential for stunning visuals within the context of the Ramayan.\n\nAnother significant flaw lies in how the film handles the sacred story of the Ramayan. \"Adipurush\" takes unnecessary liberties with the source material, deviating from the essence and integrity of the epic. The film's screenplay and characterizations fail to capture the depth and complexity of the original tale, resulting in a shallow and superficial interpretation. The narrative lacks the emotional resonance and spiritual depth that make the Ramayan such a timeless and revered story.\n\nFurthermore, the performances of the lead actors, despite their talent, fail to make a lasting impression. Prabhas, known for his charismatic presence, feels miscast as Lord Ram, lacking the gravitas and spiritual aura that the character demands. Kriti Sanon's portrayal of Sita lacks depth and fails to capture the strength and resilience of the iconic character. Saif Ali Khan's performance as Ravana, though initially promising, falls victim to weak writing and fails to elevate the character beyond a one-dimensional villain.\n\nThe pacing of \"Adipurush\" is uneven, with certain scenes dragging on for too long while others feel rushed and underdeveloped. The lack of cohesive storytelling and the absence of emotional resonance make it difficult to stay engaged throughout the film's runtime.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Adipurush\" is a disappointing cinematic experience that fails to do justice to the epic Ramayan. The film's subpar visual effects, misguided interpretation of the source material, and lackluster performances contribute to its overall lack of impact. Fans of the Ramayan and those expecting a grand and faithful adaptation will find themselves sorely let down by this underwhelming rendition."

        "review_title": "A Disastrous Departure from Tradition,total garbage.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Adipurush, a highly anticipated movie purportedly based on the Hindu epic Ramayan, falls woefully short of expectations, leaving audiences disappointed and disillusioned. From its misguided choices in visual effects to abysmal dialogues and language inconsistencies, the film misses the mark on multiple levels, resulting in a cinematic experience that can only be described as total garbage.\n\nVisual Effects: A Spectacle Gone Wrong One of the most glaring issues with Adipurush lies in its misguided choices regarding visual effects. Instead of enhancing the storytelling and immersing the viewers in a mythical world, the film's visual effects appear cheap and unconvincing. The lack of attention to detail is evident, as the CGI often looks artificial and fails to create a sense of awe or wonder. This lackluster approach robs the film of its potential to transport audiences into the enchanting realm of Ramayan, leaving them disconnected and unengaged.\n\nAbysmal Dialogues: Failing to Inspire Another major letdown of Adipurush is its woefully written dialogues. The exchanges between characters lack depth, substance, and emotional resonance, reducing pivotal moments in the story to mere shallow interactions. The film fails to capture the essence of the original mythology's profound philosophical and moral teachings, opting instead for trite and uninspiring lines that fail to leave a lasting impact. This absence of compelling dialogue hampers character development and overall narrative progression, leaving the audience yearning for more substance and authenticity.\n\nLanguage Inconsistencies: A Disrespectful Dissonance Adipurush further compounds its flaws by disregarding the importance of language consistency. In the Hindu epic Ramayan, the characters' manner of speech reflects their personalities, social backgrounds, and cultural contexts. However, in this film, the language inconsistencies are glaring and disrespectful to the source material. Characters who are traditionally depicted as refined and eloquent suddenly resort to colloquialisms and slang, diluting the cultural authenticity and diminishing the impact of their roles. This departure from tradition not only compromises the film's integrity but also demonstrates a lack of respect for the original mythology and has the potential to hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus.\n\nCharacter Transformations: An Appalling Disregard One of the most distressing aspects of Adipurush is its blatant disregard for retaining the original character personalities. The film drastically transforms Ravan, a Brahmin devotee of Shiv, who is known for his vegetarianism and adherence to strict moral codes. In this adaptation, Ravan's character is completely distorted, betraying the fundamental essence of the mythology. Such an irresponsible portrayal not only disrespects the core values of Hinduism but also undermines the rich cultural heritage that the Ramayan embodies. This departure from tradition leaves audiences questioning the intentions and motivations of the film's creators, who have chosen to deviate from a well-established narrative without valid reason or justification.\n\nConclusion: Adipurush, touted as a cinematic masterpiece based on the revered Hindu epic Ramayan, disappoints on multiple levels. Its misguided choices in visual effects, abysmal dialogues, language inconsistencies, and appalling character transformations showcase a lack of understanding, respect, and reverence for the source material. This departure from tradition not only robs the film of its potential to enchant and inspire audiences but also has the potential to hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus. Adipurush, in its current form, is an unfortunate example of a promising concept gone horribly wrong, leaving viewers yearning for a faithful and authentic adaptation that pays homage to the timeless and cherished mythology of Ramayan."

The depth and emotional resonance of the original story were sacrificed for the sake of spectacle, leaving the audience disconnected from the characters and their motivations."

        "review_title": "One time watch---an unpopular opinion.",
        "review_detailed_main": "On the unusual decent rating of three stars out of five, i.e., six out of ten:\n\nThe film has been thrashed since the launch of the teaser, and I had given up completely on the movie. Countless negative reviews, memes, trolled trailers, and commentary on the poor dialogue and VFX---the stream of critique on the movie was endless. I just went in anticipating the worst thing. And when the movie was over, I felt it was not \"that\" bad. Gets an extra star just because I was sensitized to bad bits, and the good bits felt decent, so it ended up been an anticlimactic experience for me. Had I gone in blind, I would have rated it either one or two... the anticipation of absolute worst helped. Also the acceptance of the movie being a \"loosely-adapted\" film based on Ramayana---just another action flick---helped me to just relax and watch it without the burden of negative publicity. Don't do the folly of equating it to the Ramayana despite what the title, the moviemakers, or other people affiliated with the movie say---life will be much easier that way; otherwise, all you will see is endless flaws, and then even negative stars would be insufficient to rate the movie.\n\nComing to the movie:\n\nMajor things that did not work for me:\n\na) Prabhas: One-tone angry man look. It has been six years since Baahubali 2 released, and he is still caught in that Baahubali mold. Awful. All his T-series flicks, including Saaho and Radhe Shyam, have been horrendous. Perhaps it was the genius of Rajamouli and freshness of Prabhas to non-Telugu audiences that shined in the Baahubali duology.\n\nB) Color grade of the film: Even in a 4k premiere theater with a 3D show, the entire film looks so dark. Many things are not visible at all, which might have been done to hide the many valid criticisms when the teaser was launched. No day shots or lack of light felt so off throughout the film.\n\nC) Animation: There are several interesting, nice bits of VFX and animation in the film mixed with equally poor, low-quality, horrendous effects. The most notable of the poor animation shots being everything to do with the Vanar army (Lord Ram's army) and Lanka army (Ravana's army). The sequence of Bali and Sugriva fight was simply yuck. Several of the animation shots were simply unrefined and done without due attention to the detail. The intro scene of Lord Ram also felt shoddy (I was like what the heck are Dementors doing in the film \ud83d\ude02).\n\nMajor thing that worked for me:\n\na) Sound: The sound department did good (not talking about the music here). Perhaps it was the Atmos effect, or the choice of my seating to be in the dead center of the theatre, that the sound effects and design felt good throughout the movie.\n\nB) Watching on a big screen in 3D. The scenes getting trolled everywhere did not look \"that\" bad in a big, good-quality theatre. Also some visual effects looked nice.\n\nC) Once you accept that the film is \"very\" loosely based on the original text, I liked the dark, evil (and comical in parts) portrayal of Ravana and Lanka. Although I am sure that I am in a rare company here.\n\nOn Om Raut: I liked his Lokmanya Ek Yugpurush, and thought that Tanaji was okayish--sub-par at best unlike how much people enjoyed it. The difference in quality of the two films is fairly evident when you switch from a real movie like Lokmanya into the use of VFX and animation heavy film like Tanhaji. Tanhaji felt unreal, visually dark, and unrefined in the CGI domain. Alas it at least had some live action unlike Adipurush where they bit more than they could chew---everything looks so cartoonish. Very little feels live action, which is a major bane of the film.\n\nOn Manoj Muntashir Shukla: I did not give much attention to the dialogues, so no comments---although I can firmly say that at least the dialogues were not as awful as in Brahmastra \ud83d\ude02."

After watching it I can say with assurance that people are overhyping the issues with this movie. A 5 second dialogue does not represent the vision of the makers. This is not a remake of Ramanand Sagar's Ramayana. This a vision of the director. A character's appearance does not change their historically accurate attributes. There are definite issues with movie, but making an assertion without giving it a chance is unfair. Moreover, the movie is made for close to $70 million. Movies like Ant Man Quantumania and Black Adam are made for almost triple the budget. The VFX is great considering the amount of VFX and the relatively low budget.\n\nCons: 1. There was no need to CGI Sri Ram. Prabhas's normal built was acceptable.\n\n2. They could have hired an actor who is already buffed to play Hanuman Ji. There was no need to CGI. A lot of VFX budget could have been saved on the above two points.\n\n3. The introduction of Sri Ram did not need to have so much CGI. That scene felt like the CGI artists showing off what they can do. Instead, that budget could have been utilized in improving the movements of Jamvant and the Bali-Sugriv fight.\n\n4. Someone better could have played Lakshman Ji. The actor could not do justice to the nature of Lakshman ji.\n\nPros: 1. I expected Saif to be the worst part of the movie, but turns out he was the best. He played the character really well.\n\n2. The who played Hanuman Ji was great.\n\n3. The visuals were mostly great.\n\nOverall, I welcome negative reviews for the movie, but I urge people to watch the movie legitimately before making up their mind, weather its in a theatre or on an OTT platform."

        "review_detailed_main": "Adipurush- Monumental movie with heavy reliance on VFX as the main pillar. The essence of Ravana kidnapping Sita (portion of Ramayana) story is maintained with lots of liberty.\n\nWith that sort of budget, graphics is on par with top budgeted Indian movies.\n\nPlenty of goosebumps moments- from Lord Rama meditating underwater to Hanuman ji meeting him for the first time with that warm hug, also carrying a mountain, to Vanara Sena building a bridge to Lanka with Jai Shri Ram song in the background, and finally the epic war scene that has been shot with guts and at grand scale.\n\nKumbakarna (larger than life), Vanara Sena characters and their fights are depicted really well.\n\nFeast is to see Hanuman ji \"THE REAL SUPER HERO\" realizing his strengths and his counter attack. Devdatta Nage has worked hard to build that strong body and portraying Bajrang with utmost honesty.\n\nSaif Ali Khan has shown full character and given justice to Ravana's role, although his looks are really questionable (same with Indrajit).\n\nKristin Sanon as Sita is good.\n\nPrabhas's role deserves a special mention just because of the supreme being shown as Lord Rama. His words, his deeds and actions are beyond one can imagine. This will overshadow Prabhas's acting skills as he shows little emotions during crucial scenes.\n\nKids will love this movie.\n\nThere are certain sections where movie could have been executed well.\n\nYes, certain characterization could have been changed. Yes, certain creatures are questionable. Yes, certain dialogues could have been better. Yes, Ravana's kingdom is dark and western like (Dark theme could have been portrayed as Ravana's character).\n\nBut no movie is perfect. Enjoy this imperfectness as our real superheroes battle with strong heart, with great courage and bring back respect/glory that is spoken for generations!\n\nRighteous, good deeds and the truth prevails over evil.\n\nJai Shri Ram!"

There is a lot to discuss about this attempt to alter the story. It was pathetic to see how Lord Hanuman was shown in the movie. Dialogues were written by some chapri Yutuber. It was a big insult to see Lord Hanuman was given those chapri Dialogues. Pathetic experience. Ravan was glorified in a way, his lannka was of coal rather than of gold, no natural places were shown, introduction scene of Lord Ram was poorer than the graphics of video games which use to come in early 2000. Movie was to dark to digest, Prabas reminded bahubali and saif reminded Tanaji."

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie doesn't even deserve 1 star. Only Prabhas' fans are giving it higher ratings. If you don't believe it is a money grab, just read what Manoj Muntasir said:\n\nIn an interview with AajTak, Manoj said that the film was heavily inspired by Ramayana. He said in Hindi, \"The name of the film is Adipurush. Let me be clear about two things, we have not made Ramayana, we were only inspired by it. Even if you see our disclaimer, we were very clear about it. It would have been easy for us to name the film Ramayana, keeping in mind the marketing strategies. But we knew from the beginning that we are only heavily inspired by the Ramayana, but we are not making Ramayana. We just made a small chunk of the battle fought in the Ramayana.\"\n\nNow, coming to the story, it has a lot of missing characters who play a really important part in the actual story. And most of the characters which are included don't actually play any significant role in this \"kalyug's version\".\n\nLanka is depicted as a coal mine, even KGF was better than this Lanka which is supposed to be made of gold, hence the phrase, \"sone ki Lanka\".\n\nDialogues are cringe/utter garbage, actors have no facial expressions/emotions in most of the scenes. I won't go into many details, as I think most of the reviews on social media already cover how bad the dialogues are.\n\nDon't waste time and money going to theaters. And if you are planning to take your kids thinking that they will \"learn something about our culture/history\" you are wrong. You are better off showing them \"Ramayana: The Legend of Prince Rama\"."

Lanka was supposed to be beautiful and made of gold.\n\nThe pushpak viman is literally a giant bat and not a airship/aircraft.\n\nGod Hanuman is very wise and witty, and the dialogues in this movie are not even worthy of the streets. He was supposed to be small when meeting Ma Sita, with his hands folded. But this movies shows a giant Hanuman with his first on the chest.\n\nVFX is so bad, it looks ki an intro to a demo version of a video game. The entire movie is so dark, it's difficult to make sense of the visuals. The characters are not clearly visible during fights."

The use of green screens is painfully obvious, resulting in unnatural and unconvincing environments. From poorly animated creatures to amateurish battle sequences, the VFX detracts from the overall experience, leaving viewers more distracted than engaged.\n\nIn conclusion \"Adipurush\" is a disappointment on multiple levels. Its lackluster visual effects, poor performances, and shallow storytelling overshadow any attempts at reimagining the epic Hindu mythology."

The dialogue lack the impact that epic heroes of this stature are expected to deliver. Characters sound unconvincing as they randomly oscillate between Adharma ka vidhvansa, to, tere baap ki jalegi and tu marega. The narration feels bland in the first half. It does not evoke the kind of emotional gravity that you would expect from an epic tale like Ramayana. You don't feel invested in the characters enough.\n\nThe VFX and visual appeal are passable if not impressive. The 3D feels like an unnecessary accessory.\n\nSummary: Disgusting and pathetic."

Raghava was looking more bahubali, janaki was good in some aspects but felt more like BALAJI tele soap Bahu, with all touch ups. Ravan seemed like a big fan PUSHPA, AND #@$@ with that ravan's head. SUCH a POOR direction that even THOUGH they claim its an adaptation of original RAMAYAN, sorry could connect with the product. If the fan thinks raking crores in opening weekend is success, but doesn't mean the movie is good.

I cannot recommend this movie to anyone, especially those who hold their Hindu beliefs dear. The careless depiction in \"Adipirush\" not only failed to respect the core values and practices of Hinduism but also missed an opportunity to promote harmony and empathy among diverse religious communities. It is my hope that future filmmakers approach Hindu themes with greater sensitivity and strive for authentic portrayals that foster understanding and respect."

But then Bapu is an artist and a writer par excellence besides being a great director along with his soul mate Ramana. It's not fair to compare Om Raut with them. We must give Raut his due for creating a good reference material for our grand children's generation. Prabhas was plastic and Kriti was too sensuous. They are my only two complaints. Rest of the cast was terrific. The Vanaras were superbly created. Saif was Saif. Wish Sonal Chauhan had a larger role.

I can't even say a word about Shree Hanuman ji.. i wish Shree Hanuman ji would come & trash the creators.. this is not the way you will show Ramayan to younger generation..

        "review_detailed_main": "Adipurush, touted as an epic retelling of the Ramayana, turns out to be an absolute disappointment that utterly fails to capture the essence and grandeur of the ancient epic. From its cringe-worthy bat dialogs to its questionable casting choices and misrepresentations of the Ramayana, this film is a colossal letdown.\n\nLet's start with the bat dialogs. It's mind-boggling how the filmmakers thought it would be a good idea to include such juvenile and ridiculous dialogues in a supposedly epic movie. The usage of modern slang and language completely undermines the authenticity and reverence that should have been accorded to the Ramayana. It feels like the writers were more interested in pandering to a younger audience rather than treating the source material with respect.\n\nNext comes the casting, which is nothing short of a disaster. While Prabhas may be a popular actor, he is woefully miscast as Lord Rama. His portrayal lacks the depth, charisma, and regal aura that one would expect from the legendary character. The casting decision feels more like a marketing gimmick aimed at capitalizing on Prabhas' star power rather than a thoughtful choice to bring the character of Lord Rama to life.\n\nThe misrepresentation of the Ramayana is perhaps the most egregious offense committed by Adipurush. The filmmakers have taken significant liberties with the original story, distorting key elements and diluting its cultural and spiritual significance. The epic is a revered and cherished part of Indian heritage, and it deserved a faithful adaptation that respects its core values and teachings. Instead, Adipurush presents a watered-down version that does a disservice to the original text and its followers.\n\nMoreover, the film fails to create a cohesive narrative and struggles to maintain a consistent tone. The pacing feels uneven, with unnecessary deviations and subplots that add nothing substantial to the overall story. This lack of focus undermines the emotional impact and fails to capture the epic scale and timeless appeal of the Ramayana.\n\nIn terms of visual effects and production design, Adipurush falls short of expectations as well. The CGI feels artificial and unconvincing, failing to create a seamless blend between the real and the mythical worlds. The film's set designs lack the grandeur and attention to detail that would have brought the ancient era to life. It feels like a missed opportunity to create a visually stunning and immersive experience.\n\nAll in all, Adipurush is a misfire on multiple fronts. Its bat dialogs, questionable casting choices, and misrepresentations of the Ramayana leave a bitter taste in the mouths of those who were eagerly anticipating a faithful and awe-inspiring retelling of the epic. It's a disservice to the rich cultural heritage it claims to represent and an example of how not to adapt a beloved story. Save your time and seek out other adaptations that do justice to the epic tale of the Ramayana."

        "review_title": "Disappointing Departure from Sacred Texts and Mythological Figures",
        "review_detailed_main": "Adipurush, a highly anticipated film based on sacred texts and books, had the potential to captivate audiences with its retelling of ancient tales. Unfortunately, the movie falls short in various aspects, deviating from the way life has been portrayed in these revered texts. The characters in Adipurush fail to do justice to the actual personalities of the holy figures they represent, leaving audiences feeling disconnected and disappointed.\n\nOne of the significant disappointments in Adipurush is the portrayal of Hanumanji. A character known for his charisma and wisdom, Hanumanji's portrayal lacks the captivating presence that is expected of him. The dialogues given to this iconic character are wasted, failing to convey the depth and essence of Hanumanji's wisdom and devotion. This missed opportunity to bring out the true charisma of Hanumanji is a major letdown for fans.\n\nAnother drawback of Adipurush lies in its language. The movie suffers from a lack of clarity in its dialogue delivery, with an excessive use of modern slangs that seem out of place in the ancient setting. This modernization of language undermines the authenticity of the film and creates a jarring contrast between the setting and the dialogue. It would have been more appropriate to use language that resonates with the historical period being depicted.\n\nMoreover, the characters of Ram and Ravan, central figures in the epic tale, are portrayed in a manner that deviates significantly from their well-known personalities. The film fails to capture the essence of these characters, resulting in a lack of emotional connection between the audience and the protagonists. The portrayal of Ram and Ravan lacks the complexity and depth that make them such compelling figures in mythology.\n\nFurthermore, Adipurush fails to evoke the feeling of a kingdom for either Ram or Ravan. The grandeur and magnificence that are synonymous with these characters' reigns are missing, leaving the audience without a true sense of the power and glory that they once possessed. The lack of attention to this crucial aspect detracts from the overall immersive experience of the film.\n\nOne of the most disappointing aspects of Adipurush is its excessive reliance on Western animation and models. Rather than creating a unique visual style that pays homage to the source material, the movie feels like a sluggish copy of some cheap Hollywood production. This over-adaptation of Western influences diminishes the originality and distinctiveness that could have been achieved, resulting in a lackluster cinematic experience.\n\nIn conclusion, Adipurush fails to live up to the expectations set by its source material. The movie's departure from the way life has been portrayed in sacred texts and books is a major letdown, leaving fans feeling disconnected. The characters in the film, including Hanumanji, lack the charisma and depth that they should possess, and the use of modern slangs in the dialogue further undermines the film's authenticity. Additionally, the portrayal of Ram and Ravan is inconsistent with their true personalities, and the film fails to evoke the grandeur and kingdom associated with these figures. The excessive adaptation of Western animation and models only adds to the disappointment, making Adipurush feel like a lackluster imitation of a cheap Hollywood movie. Overall, Adipurush falls short in its execution and fails to deliver a captivating cinematic experience."

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie Adipurush, a parody of the epic Ramayana, attempts to incorporate its own imaginative elements inspired by Hollywood movies. However, this attempt has backfired, resulting in a disastrous outcome. The Ramayana is not merely a story from Hindu mythology, but a guide for individuals on how to live a good and respectful life. These teachings have been passed down through generations by our parents and grandparents.\n\nThe epic emphasizes the importance of responsibilities, with the husband being the head of the household and the wife managing the home. It also emphasizes the significance of young people following and respecting their elders. On the other side of the story, Ravana, the king of Lanka, is portrayed as a character who is not a demon but rather overconfident and possesses excessive self-respect. This overconfidence stems from his victories and his devotion to the gods. However, it leads him to become excessively greedy, believing he can do whatever he desires, including capturing and imprisoning women.\n\nRavana's character teaches us the dangers of becoming overconfident in our own success, as it can ultimately lead to a downfall from a high position to a low one. The movie also introduces creative elements such as Ravana forcefully stealing the sky chariot, Pushpaka Viman, from Kubera, which transforms into a demonic bat. However, these additions seem to be attempts to inject Hollywood-inspired imagination into the minds of the audience, but they are received poorly and result in a disaster.\n\nI strongly object to this narrative of the great epic Ramayana being turned into a parody. The movie Adipurush fails to capture the essence of the original story and instead presents a distorted version that deviates from the valuable lessons and teachings it imparts."

The plot stumbled aimlessly from one scene to another, lacking any semblance of structure or purpose. It was a chaotic mess that left me questioning why I bothered to invest even a moment of my life in this drivel.\n\nIf the abhorrent storytelling wasn't enough to enrage me, the agonizingly slow pace pushed me to the brink of insanity. Each scene dragged on for an eternity, as if the filmmakers took pleasure in torturing their audience. I couldn't help but wonder if they had a bet going on who could create the most unbearable cinematic experience. Congratulations, you won!\n\nThe characters in this cinematic catastrophe were as lifeless as a corpse in a morgue. Their motivations were vague and their actions inexplicable. I felt zero connection or empathy towards any of them, as they stumbled through the film like clueless puppets. It was a baffling display of lazy writing and uninspired performances that left me seething with anger.\n\nLet's not forget the technical aspects, or should I say lack thereof. The cinematography was a disgrace, featuring unimaginative shots and a complete disregard for visual storytelling. It was as if the cameraperson had fallen asleep and accidentally pressed record. And don't even get me started on the drab color grading and forgettable soundtrack. It was a cacophony of mediocrity that assaulted my senses.\n\nTo call this film \"regional\" would be an insult to regional cinema. It failed to capture any essence of its supposed cultural backdrop, reducing it to a laughable backdrop devoid of authenticity. It was a slap in the face to the rich tapestry of regional storytelling, and I resent the filmmakers for their blatant disregard.\n\nThe most infuriating aspect of this whole ordeal was the complete lack of emotional impact. I went into this film hoping to be moved, to be touched by the human experience. Instead, I was left cold and empty, with no trace of the promised emotional journey. It was an insult to my emotions and a blatant waste of my time.\n\nIn conclusion, \"An Agonizing Journey\" is a shameful testament to the incompetence of its creators. It is a prime example of everything that can go wrong in filmmaking. From the haphazard storytelling to the lifeless characters and the technical disaster, this film fails on every possible level. I urge you, fellow moviegoers, to spare yourself the agony and avoid this abomination at all costs."

The emotional display in the movie is dismayal. Actors havent even tried to portray any kind of emotions . Further the movie is made in such dark mode that it sometimes feel difficuilt to even see the faces of the characters clearly. Extremely poor movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Adipurush is a 2023 Indian epic action film that had the potential to be a great adaptation of the Hindu epic Ramayana. However, the film is ultimately a disappointment, thanks to its slow pacing, uneven tone, and lack of emotional depth.\n\nThe film's performances are all solid, with Prabhas giving a good performance as Rama and Saif Ali Khan giving a more nuanced performance as Ravana. However, the film's supporting cast is largely underutilized, and the film's action sequences are not as exciting as they could have been.\n\nThe film's biggest problem is its pacing. The first half of the film is slow and ponderous, and the film's tone is uneven, veering between serious and comedic. This makes it difficult to get invested in the story or the characters.\n\nThe film also lacks emotional depth. The film's battle scenes are exciting, but they lack the emotional impact that they could have had. The film's love story between Rama and Sita is also underdeveloped.\n\nOverall, Adipurush is a missed opportunity. The film had the potential to be a great adaptation of the Ramayana, but it is ultimately a disappointment."

It just can't be.\n\nMaking a blatant mockery of the great religious epic, this film showcases the worst side of today's Bollywood, which has become creatively bankrupt in recent times.\n\nI had loved Om Raut's Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior (2020) and naturally, was eagerly awaiting his interpretation of Ramayan. But Adipurush was a painful watch. It truly saddens and pains you to view the substandard execution on all aspects from VFX to dialogues to those jarring animated demons jumping on your face in 3D. The dark colour pallette given to the supposedly glittering 'Sone Ki Lanka' makes you wonder if this Raavan is inhabiting some other universe here. Asgard, probably!!\n\nThe only saving grace (if you can call it that) is Ajay Atul's scintillating score with 'Jai Shri Ram' chants elevating the proceedings to a reasonable extent.\n\nPrabhas, a brilliant actor no doubt, reprises his Bahubali act while playing Lord Ram. The serene and calm composure associated with the God is missing. Not his fault, the script offers no scope. Kriti Sanon is beautiful but lacks the purity and sanctity of Mata Sita. You can say Saif has performed well if his character was Alauddin Khilji and not Raavan. Devdatta Nage, another fantastic actor, is made to play Lord Hanuman mouthing lines like 'Tere baap ki..'. Oh please!! Sunny Singh is turned in to an extra as Laxman. And pray, what was the need to show Vibhishan's wife (Trupti Toradmal) with all that cleavage sheavage? Who even thought of this scene, man!!\n\nI can go on ranting but honestly, that will be an exercise in futility. Bollywood ka 'funda' is crystal clear, nowadays. Just rake in the moolah within the first weekend and then sell the movie on OTT to garner the profits and move on. Creativity or aesthetics be damned!!\n\nAdipurush may become a box office hit if I go by the 'Housefull' crowd at Citylight Cinema, Matunga where I saw it last evening. But does that really matter?!! Ramanand Sagar's TV series Ramayan (1987) is still remembered and revered after three decades. Adipurush will be forgotten by next friday. Or is it already??!!!\n\nRegards, Sumeet Nadkarni."

Before release I was very fond of this movie. I had almost listened 100times the \"Ram siya ram\" song. This movie is mere message of RSS. The most notorious organisation of the world.\n\nOne must avoid any right wing movie in future. A movie whose on paper budget is 600cr and on-screen such performance raise alot question about integrity.\n\nThank you!\n\nGood day!"

It's disheartening to see such potential go to waste. I had high expectations for this film, but unfortunately, it fell short in several aspects. Overall, I wouldn't recommend Adipurush if you're looking for a compelling storyline, well-developed characters, and skilled direction."

        "review_detailed_main": "The film revolves around the legendary tale of Lord Rama and his epic battle against the formidable demon king Ravana. Director Om Raut weaves together a compelling narrative that stays true to the essence of the original myth while adding his own creative flair. The screenplay strikes a perfect balance between staying faithful to the source material and offering fresh interpretations, making the story accessible to both fans of Hindu mythology and newcomers alike.\n\nOne of the film's biggest strengths lies in its exceptional visual effects and production design. The grandeur of the sets, intricate costumes, and awe-inspiring landscapes transport viewers into a world that feels both mythical and tangible. The action sequences are masterfully choreographed, showcasing epic battles and breathtaking stunts that will leave you on the edge of your seat. The visual effects seamlessly blend with the live-action, creating a truly immersive experience .Prabhas delivers a captivating performance as Lord Rama, capturing the essence of the revered deity with his commanding presence and emotional depth. Saif Ali Khan, in the role of Ravana, brings a mesmerizing intensity and complexity to the screen, making him a compelling antagonist.\n\nAdipurush\" is a spectacular cinematic masterpiece that seamlessly blends myth and modern filmmaking. With its breathtaking visuals, stellar performances, and compelling storytelling, it captivates from start to finish."

Our history is a joke to these propoganda filmmakers as they have not shown a single sliver of respect to our ancestors and our culture.\n\nAdipurush the movie fails horribly in every aspect of film making. What I can't seem to understand is after having so many scriptures/puranas/granths , how can they not get the gist of it.\n\nAre they that dumb?\n\nMaybe not a single person on the Adipurush Movie's team has seen the movie in its entirety before the actual release. That is the only reason they have created such a mind numbing dumb motion picture on one of our greatest ancient treasure.\n\nMovies like this should be BANNED and filmmakers like them should be ashamed of themselves. Have some dignity and leave the film business."

He was a super intelligent leader and got caught in the wrong battle so badly that he had to be embarrassingly defeated after a long battle.\n\n2) It is hard to believe that Gods speak Mumbai Hindi like street-side goons!\n\n3) Lord Ram has fought many battles like a 14 year exile and fighting to rescue and bring back his better half from a country that was unreachable about 5000 years ago. He did all of this and led his life with great dignity. Prabhas (who was great in Bahubali) portrays him like a domestic political activist that's ready to fight at any provocation. This is just not correct...\n\n4) The saddest part in this tirade was Lord Hanuman, who was reduced to a comic rather than the mountain of strength that he is. Over a billion Indians pray to Lord Hanuman at any time when they need some strength from within. The film makers could best depict him as an ape face side-bob with a lacking physique in comparison to any of the other leads, ridiculous!\n\nFor those that have missed watching this flick and are still eager, please give yourself and your senses some rest and avoid this film like the plague!"

Yugo Sako before before making his animated version went through 10 different versions of Ramayan to understand it better. This completely explains that Om Raut's and entire production team only had one aim behind making this movie.... Paisa hi Paisa hoga.\n\nI mean decades before respected Ramanand Sagar created such a beautiful depiction of one of the most epic saga in the Indian history and Yugo Sako contributed his entire life spreading the knowledge of this legendary literature. And then Om Raut goes ahead and contribute to their Legacy with this ... I don't know which word will do justice to whatever in the hell he has made.\n\nIt really makes me shameful of being an Indian that People of other country than my own have higher respect and better undertanding of the sentimental elements and teachings of The Ramayan and our own people tend to make this mockery of it.\n\nWhen Yugo Sako proposed to release his depicition of Ramayan in India, Vishwa Hindu Parishad forbade him to do so and claimed it as a historical legacy of India not to be interfered by an outsider. Well, Tumne Konse Jhande gaad liye ise apne paas rakhke. This movie is a complete disgrace on his and Ramanand Sagar's Legacy and should not be shown to the future generation so as not to have their opinion on Ramayan to be misled in wrong direction. If you have shown this movie to your chidren as their first version of Ramayan, then they are in some serious need of purification as soon as possible. Show them the original depicition, so that they can catch up on the learning of life that Ramayan is supposed to give to them.\n\nPS: Don't take me as some sort of holy or kattar Hindu guy who is very intense for the protection of Hinduism. It's just I can't withstand the disrespect of any form of Great creation whose purpose is to spread the teachings of life let it be of any religion or origin."

Dialogues are utter non-sense, this matches the dialect of a Delhi Chor bazar guy. The conspiracy can be seen here where our Sita Maa is seen as beheaded by Ravana. What non-sense.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Adipurush,\" the new Indian mythological action-fantasy film, presents a familiar tale with a star-studded cast, including Prabhas in the lead role. The movie's ambition to adapt elements from The Ramayana while bringing larger-than-life Hindu gods and epic battles to the screen is evident. However, it struggles to rise above its visual shortcomings, particularly its subpar and distractingly artificial special effects.\n\nThe narrative revolves around the courageous hero Raghava (Prabhas), also known as Ram, who sets out to rescue his kidnapped wife Sita (Kriti Sanon) from the clutches of the evil multi-headed god Lankesh/Ravana (Saif Ali Khan). The film's title, \"Adipurush,\" meaning \"First Man\" in Sanskrit, hints at its mythological themes and the grandeur it aspires to achieve.\n\nUnfortunately, the film's visual effects undermine its potential greatness. The amateurish and unconvincing computer-generated imagery detracts from the immersive experience, making the first part of the film feel tedious and uninspiring. Despite the high budget, the shoddy green-screen compositing and poorly-rendered elements overshadow the otherwise captivating narrative.\n\nPrabhas' charismatic presence and his initial confrontation with demonic wraiths offer moments of excitement, but the film's technical shortcomings become increasingly evident as the story unfolds. The scenes involving Sita and Raghava's romantic moments encircled by poorly-executed pink flamingos exemplify the film's struggle to create a believable world.\n\nAdditionally, the musical numbers, particularly those involving Sita and Lankesh, suffer from lackluster visuals and fail to generate the desired emotional impact. The film's poetic song lyrics and expository dialogue often come across as forced and contrived. The characters' movements often serve to highlight the deficiencies of the computer-generated graphics, diminishing the overall quality of the film.\n\nDespite its derivative nature, borrowing elements from popular series like \"Game of Thrones\" and \"Lord of the Rings,\" as well as the \"Baahubali\" films, \"Adipurush\" manages to salvage some dramatic tension in its concluding battles. The showdown between Raghava, his brother Sesh/Laxmana, and the formidable Lankesh and his second-in-command Indrajit provides a narrow focus that delivers sporadic moments of engagement.\n\nDirector Om Raut, known for his work on \"Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior,\" attempts to infuse the film with grandeur, particularly in its climactic battle scenes. Yet, even as the film gradually escalates towards its finale, the subpar visual effects persist, inhibiting the realization of its full potential.\n\nIn the end, \"Adipurush\" grapples with the paradox of aiming for epic proportions while being hindered by its own technical limitations. While the film's cast and its ambitious narrative offer glimpses of promise, its glaring visual flaws and lack of visual finesse ultimately prevent it from achieving the grand cinematic spectacle it aspires to be. I would rate the film a 5/10 due to its disappointing visual execution and missed opportunities to create a truly immersive mythological experience."

        "review_detailed_main": "Today, I am going to review the movie \"Adhipurush\" with full detail. I will discuss every positive and negative aspect of this movie. So let's start with the positive side, I will share what I personally liked about this movie.\n\nPositive - The songs of this movie are really good. They bring peace to the heart when listened to, and the background music is also excellent. It successfully manages to give you goosebumps in certain scenes. Additionally, there are two or three scenes in the movie that look visually stunning. The color grading, cinematography, lighting, and other aspects are all very well done. Speaking of acting, Saif Ali Khan has given a great performance as Ravan in the movie.\n\nNegative - Ugh, the whole movie is negative, man. Matlab kya thaa yeh? There are so many mistakes in this movie, I mean, so many that if I start counting them one by one, it will take the whole day. The biggest negative point of this movie is the VFX and CGI they are really bad, beyond terrible. Every single CG character looks fake, not a single one looks real. Even Prabhas as Ram and Saif Ali Khan as Ravan, their body CGI is really bad, you can clearly see on screen how poorly the CG work was done. After CGI and VFX, if there's the biggest problem with this movie, it's the costume design and makeup. Looking at any character, you don't feel like they are from the Ramayana; in the pursuit of giving a modern touch, the filmmakers have made such a bad joke with us. And when it comes to acting, no one has done good acting except for Saif Ali Khan. Prabhas has the same facial expression throughout the entire film. And tell me, who did the casting for this movie? Prabhas as Ram doesn't fit at all. Prabhas looks more like Ravan than Ram. The same goes for Lakshman and Hanuman. In the pursuit of a modern-day adaptation, the makers have completely ruined it. And as for Om Raut, the director of this movie, forget about him. He doesn't even know the basics of direction. The National Award he received for Tanhaji, please take it back. No one could have imagined such a terrible adaptation of the Ramayana, not even in their dreams. The dialogue writer hasn't done a good job either. Some dialogues are alright, but the majority of them are really bad. The director wasted 700 crores. This movie should have never been made, it shouldn't even exist. I feel ashamed to say that this is Indian cinema. It's a stain on the name of movies.\n\nI want to give an example. Last year a movie was released called \"Everything Everywhere All at Once.\" This movie won an Oscar in 2023, and do you know how many people worked on the VFX and CGI for this movie? Only five people. Just five individuals worked together to create the entire VFX for the movie, and it still won an Oscar. And here you guys failed miserably with a budget of 700 crore. In the eyes of the audience, this will be considered the biggest disaster movie in world history."

This movie s**ks in each department.\n\nThey call it story of Ram and Sita and then they use dialogs which are pedestrian even for today. Do u think Lord Hanuman who is the living symbol of the word \"Humble\" would arrogantly call \"tere Baapka\". Mr. Mutashir or whosoever he is must surgically seal his lips and amputate his fingers."

        "review_detailed_main": "The much-anticipated cinematic adaptation of the beloved Indian epic Ramayana, falls miserably short of expectations. The film's execution is plagued by a series of regrettable choices, resulting in a cinematic disaster that fails to honor the source material.\n\nOne of the most glaring issues with Adipurush is its abysmal dialogue. The lines are poorly written, lacking depth, and failing to capture the essence of the original epic. The film's characters, including the revered Lord Rama, are reduced to caricatures, uttering cringe-worthy lines that do a disservice to the rich and nuanced personalities we know from the Ramayana.\n\nFurthermore, the visual effects in Adipurush are downright appalling. In an age where technological advancements have brought us breathtaking spectacles, Adipurush manages to showcase some of the worst VFX work seen in recent memory. The poorly rendered creatures and underwhelming battle sequences detract from any potential excitement or engagement the film could have generated.\n\nPerhaps the most disheartening aspect of Adipurush is the filmmakers' apparent disregard for the source material's integrity. By attempting to infuse the \"masala\" movie formula into a revered epic like the Ramayana, they have diluted its essence and tarnished its timeless message. It is a disservice to the countless generations that have held the Ramayana dear to their hearts.\n\nAdipurush is a colossal disappointment on all fronts. Its cringe-worthy dialogue, abysmal visual effects, and disrespectful treatment of the epic source material make it a painful watch for any lover of the Ramayana. It is a plea to the filmmakers to stick to what they excel at, rather than attempting to capitalize on treasured stories that deserve a more thoughtful and respectful treatment.\n\nAbove lines are from Chat GPT and it wrote a way better movie review than the movie itself. A Generative AI version of movie would be much better than this one."

Prabhas is the biggest super star of India. Raghava and janaki are looking good.kid will enjoy the movie.so make sure everyone to watch it.if you watch in 3d it will be good.

The primary objective of this movie was to acquaint the upcoming generation with Indian culture and their roots, and I believe the movie succeeded entirely in achieving that goal. This was the underlying theme of the film, and it was executed very effectively, without aiming to offend anyone.\n\nThe closed-minded perspective of those who criticized this movie (scoring it 3.2 on the scale here) highlights and epitomizes narrow thinking. Of course, I watched the OTT version of the movie, so I didn't find any issue with the dialogues at all. This is because the movie was made in 2023 (released), not like 40 years ago, and we need to move forward with the times while also trying to pass on the culture to the next generation. I believe the creators of this movie were quite successful in doing so.\n\nIf someone is complaining about the visual effects, then what exactly are Indian audiences expecting? Were they anticipating Avengers-like VFX or Spider-Man or DC-level budgets to enhance the visual effects? Let's be realistic. Most of us Indians grew up with characters like 'Fauladi Singh', 'Shaktimaan', and for the love of these things, let me also mention Indian sci-fi 'blockbusters' like 'Shiva Ka Insaaf', 'Mr. India', and so on. And if we compare that (which is mostly what Indian audiences have been served and embraced) with the effects in this movie, they are quite sophisticated... they are considerably good. So, we can't compare apples and pears. Let's not compare it with a Marvel or DC budget film, but instead, recognize that the producers have gone the extra mile to present us with decent VFX.\n\nI'm a sci-fi buff, and I'll say it again, the VFX are pretty okay. Therefore, I don't comprehend why people have criticized this movie. I myself went through the Indian education system, and Ramayan and Mahabharat were part of our curriculum, and I grew up with them as a Hindu. This movie conveys the right message, which I was able to communicate to my kids through their eyes, in the year 2023, where we have access to jet-age technology and AI at our fingertips. So, I must say congratulations to the creators of this movie. Of course, there are some mistakes that I could point out. For example, Ram not hiding behind a tree or obstacle to kill 'Vali', even though that was the case, and not showing when 'Raavan' meets his end, then he praises and honors RAM for showing him the path to salvation, etc. So, some minor details were missing, but to bring an idea as extensive as the Ramayan (which has around seven 'kands') onto the screen in about two and a half hours is an enormous task. In fact, it's so immense that people might not realize the extent of effort required to create something like this and condense it within two and a half or three hours.\n\nI think the Indian audience (the majority of viewers of this film have Indian roots) might be better off watching films like 'Pathan' and others of that sort. It's a tragedy that there might never again be quality epic movies made, just because this one was criticized so vehemently & debunked."

How they can change the story which is a great Indian mythology, by just putting disclaimer as \"this is not original Ramayana\", they have no rights to change the original story as their wish. The movie will misguide and wrongly project the Indian culture for the future generations. The movie should be banned immediately and whole movie team should apologize the Hindus."

I appeal to all that please don't watch this movie and don't waste your money. They just insult the Hindu gods and twisted the ramayan based on their likings. Anyways this movie should be banned by the Indian government. A BIG NO to this movie.\n\nI could have given -10 but it doesn't allow here so only 1 star that too for the song Ram Siya Ram."

After watching it viewers will be left contemplating that Aadipurush is not an attempt of filmmaking but the makers have taken it just as a commercial project to earn money by cashing in the recently rising religious sentiment in India. This is proven by interviews of ignorant filmmakers hurting sentiments of people within and neighboring countries. Manoj Muntashir in particular has demonstrated how pathetic his level of knowledge in history is and is utterly unqualified to be in any sort of filmmaking.\n\nSave yourself the trauma of wasting time and money and do not watch this piece of historic garbage."

The whole film is a collection of failed experiments.\n\nParents please don't show this to your kids as Epic Ramayan if they are watching Ramayan for first time. This is really very misleading film.\n\nAll 7 elements of Film failed : Setting, Conflict, Character, Dialogue, Theme, Plot, and Climax.\n\n1) Setting: 1/10: When attempting to incorporate a renowned epic into one's own imaginary universe, one must exercise extreme caution. Looks like some immature kids work.\n\n>>>No army of the dead existed under Ravan. It was a mockery, to see the skullman army.\n\n>>>Another mistake was making Lanka look like a dark, black castle . Lanka is a beautiful green place.\n\n>>>VFX Overdone : Instead of a handful, the screen was completely covered with peacocks, deers, and birds in several scenes. How could such a basic thing go unnoticed? It looked so cluttered.\n\n>>> Planet of Apes movie copied for Vanar Sena.\n\n>>> What a mess done with pushpak viman . Why why why extreme experiment and that also game of thrones as is copy no innovation.\n\n>>>That's a terribly dumb thing to do. As an alternative to jewellery, Sita's necklace single pearl is used for her tracing.\n\n2) Conflict : 1/10 : The scene where they teased Raghav about Sita's death was very silly. That didn't help show how angry Raghav was. Instead, it made Ravan look stupid.\n\n3) Character: 0/10 : Movie didn't do a good job of establishing Characters. Not good at all. Very bad casting .\n\n>>> Its known that Raghav was from Ayodhya and Ravan was from Lanka, it should have made sense that they looked like Natives.\n\n>>>Ravan looked liked more of Aryan than a Lanka native. Anyone who has watched Game of Thrones will know its as is copy of John Snow.\n\n>>>Laxman such an innocent face. No aggressiveness.\n\n>>>Sita is admired and respected as a graceful strong woman. The way the actress acted didn't do justice to Sita's role. She looked very stupid and fragile. In a scene where Hanuman does something funny, her response seems so foolish given the role she is in. Her dressing was copied from some old Nal Damyanti paintings and similar goose were seen in some scenes.\n\n>>>Raghav and Jaanki's connection could not be strengthened via songs too. It would have been more effective to show Jaanki and Raghav trekking through woods, enduring difficulties, and cooking and eating together rather than showing them in a glamorous setting surrounded by sunflower fields.\n\n>>> No connect between Raghav and Hanuman Then Surpankha, Mandodari, Vibhishan. Meghnath - was the industry lack of people none of them fit the role. I will say TV serials which have made Ramayan did better casting.\n\nNone of the Characters met the expectations of the role.\n\n4) Dialogue : 0/10: who approved dialogues even if writer wrote that stuff. As a team all failed.\n\n5/6) Theme/Plot: Negative points as film did blunder with the Epic Ramayan. Every possible mistake can be witnessed in this movie .\n\n7) Climax : what a bad ending ... audience who was sitting for 3 hrs need to absorb the emotions at end . However with the film which failed to engage from beginning what could be expected at end.\n\n--------- 2 things which can be appreciated.\n\n1) Shiv upasana done by Ravan beautiful work.\n\n2) Raghav killing Vali, and it was clear why he had to shoot Vali from behind."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Adipurush\" promised to be an epic retelling of a beloved Indian mythological tale, but unfortunately, it falls short of expectations. The film, directed by Mr om raut boasts an impressive cast and a grand scale production, but it fails to deliver on its potential due to weak dialogues and a lackluster presentation of characters.\n\nOne of the most disappointing aspects of \"Adipurush\" is its dialogues. The lines lack depth and fail to engage the audience. The script seems to rely heavily on clich\u00e9s and lacks the poetic or impactful language that one would expect from a mythological epic. The dialogues are often forgettable and fail to create a strong emotional connection with the viewers. This becomes a major drawback, as a good dialogue can elevate the performances and enhance the overall cinematic experience.\n\nThe way the characters are presented is another letdown. The film revolves around iconic characters from Indian mythology, such as Lord Rama and Ravana, who are meant to have rich and complex personalities. However, the character development feels shallow, and the performances fail to bring out the depth and nuances of these legendary figures. There is a lack of emotional depth and connection in the portrayal of the characters, making it difficult for the audience to truly invest in their journey.\n\nAdditionally, the pacing of the film is inconsistent. While some scenes are well-executed and keep the audience engaged, there are moments where the narrative drags, and the story loses its momentum. This uneven pacing disrupts the flow of the film, leading to a disjointed viewing experience.\n\nHowever, the technical aspects alone cannot save the film from its weak dialogues and lackluster character presentation. Despite its grand scale and visual appeal, \"Adipurush\" fails to leave a lasting impact.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Adipurush\" falls short of its potential as a mythological epic. Weak dialogues and a disappointing presentation of characters hinder the film's ability to engage and captivate the audience. While the production design and visual effects are impressive, they alone cannot salvage the film."

        "review_detailed_main": "ADIPURUSH - A DISAPPOINTING CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE\n\nAdipurush, touted as a highly anticipated blockbuster, fails to live up to the hype and expectations surrounding it. From its weak storytelling to questionable casting choices, the film leaves much to be desired. In this review, I will delve into the specific points that contribute to its disappointing nature.\n\nLACKLUSTER STORYTELLING: Adipurush suffers from a lackluster and poorly executed narrative. The storytelling feels disjointed, with significant gaps and underdeveloped character arcs. The plot fails to engage the audience, leaving them disconnected from the events unfolding on the screen. The script lacks depth, relying heavily on clich\u00e9s and predictable plot twists that do little to surprise or captivate viewers.\n\nMISFIT CASTING: One of the major drawbacks of Adipurush is the misfit casting choices. The film features a star cast that seems more concerned with their stardom than delivering convincing performances. The lead actor fails to embody the character, lacking the necessary depth and emotional range required for such a pivotal role. This miscasting severely impacts the overall viewing experience and hampers the authenticity of the narrative.\n\nPOOR CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: The characters in Adipurush are severely underdeveloped, reducing their impact and making it difficult for the audience to empathize with them. The lack of backstory and motivation for the characters leaves them feeling one-dimensional and unrelatable. The film fails to explore the emotional depth of its characters, resulting in a superficial portrayal that fails to leave a lasting impression.\n\nNCONSISTENT VISUAL EFFECTS: While Adipurush boasts grand visuals, the execution of visual effects leaves much to be desired. The inconsistency in the quality of CGI is jarring and often takes the viewer out of the immersive experience. Some scenes are visually stunning, while others appear amateurish and poorly rendered. This inconsistency undermines the film's overall production value and fails to deliver the visual spectacle expected from a high-budget production.\n\nPacing Issues: Adipurush suffers from significant pacing issues, resulting in a lack of cohesion and rhythm throughout the film. The narrative jumps between scenes and timelines without proper transitions, making it difficult to follow the story's progression. The pacing often feels rushed, sacrificing crucial moments that could have added depth and emotional resonance to the film.\n\nLack of Originality: The film falls victim to a lack of originality, relying heavily on tried and tested tropes and formulaic storytelling. Adipurush fails to bring anything fresh or innovative to the table, leaving the audience with a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. The lack of original ideas and unique storytelling elements further diminishes the overall impact and appeal of the film.\n\nConclusion: Adipurush, despite its pre-release hype and promising premise, disappoints on multiple fronts. Its weak storytelling, misfit casting choices, poor character development, inconsistent visual effects, pacing issues, and lack of originality all contribute to a lackluster cinematic experience. As a viewer, it is disheartening to witness the potential of a film being squandered due to these fundamental flaws. Adipurush fails to live up to its own aspirations and leaves audiences yearning for a more engaging and compelling cinematic journey."

The damage it will do to the minds of the younger generation can be irreparable. No amount of justification, re-edits or apologies (although none can be expected from these folks anymore) can undo the garbage that has been thrown at the audience in the name of movie-making. Utterly disgusted!"

Because this movie doesn't have even 1% of the class that Ramanand Sagar's Ramayana has.\n\nWorst VFX I have ever seen. The dialogues the actors are delivering it's insult of the story of the Ramayana. The graphic animation is very unrealistic. Bollywood should stop competing with Hollywood in terms of VFX and animation. Don't waste your money on this. There are many good content in which you can invest that money. And the worst part is this movie is making money by the negetive publicity. It's a shame that they made the story of The Ramayana looks like a joke."

If someone is making a movie on Ramayana then they have to stick to it, they cant get away with words like \"Modern Day Ramayana\" and \"Creative Liberties\", this movie was done on purpose to hurt Hindu sentiments."

        "review_title": "An Underwhelming Mythological Misfire",
        "review_detailed_main": "Adipurush, touted as an epic mythological extravaganza, falls far short of its lofty promises and leaves the audience disappointed. Director Om Raut's ambitious attempt to recreate the timeless tale of Ramayana with a modern twist ultimately proves to be a convoluted mess that fails to live up to its potential.\n\nOne of the major shortcomings of Adipurush lies in its storytelling. Despite having a rich source material like the Ramayana, the film's narrative feels disjointed and lacks coherence. The screenplay fails to effectively adapt the complex characters and intricate plotlines, resulting in a confusing mishmash of sequences that fails to engage the audience. The film jumps from one event to another without providing a proper foundation or emotional connection, leaving the viewers feeling detached and uninvested in the story.\n\nAnother glaring issue with Adipurush is its casting choices. While Prabhas, known for his charismatic presence, tries his best to embody the iconic character of Lord Rama, his performance lacks depth and fails to capture the essence of the legendary hero. The supporting cast, including Kriti Sanon as Sita and Saif Ali Khan as Ravana, delivers lackluster performances, further diminishing the film's overall impact. The chemistry between the characters feels forced and lacks the necessary chemistry to make the relationships believable.\n\nThe visual effects, touted as one of the film's main highlights, are underwhelming at best. While there are a few visually stunning moments, the overall execution feels mediocre and fails to create a sense of awe that one would expect from a mythological epic. The action sequences, though ambitious, suffer from poor choreography and lack the finesse required to make them truly captivating.\n\nAdipurush also stumbles in its attempt to present a modern take on the Ramayana. The film incorporates elements of social commentary and attempts to address relevant issues, but the execution feels heavy-handed and lacks subtlety. The message gets lost amidst the chaotic narrative, leaving the audience perplexed and detached from the intended themes.\n\nOverall, Adipurush is a disappointing cinematic experience. Its lackluster storytelling, uninspired performances, subpar visual effects, and muddled attempt at modernization make it a forgettable addition to the ever-expanding list of mythological adaptations. While the concept held immense potential, the execution falls flat, leaving audiences longing for a more captivating and faithful retelling of the epic tale of Ramayana."

Unfortunately, after watching the film, I can't help but feel deeply disappointed and even disgusted by the overall execution. Adipurush falls short on multiple fronts, leaving me with a bitter taste in my mouth. The dialogues are clunky and lack impact, failing to resonate. The unnecessary emphasis on violence and gore feels gratuitous and out of place, tarnishing the moral and ethical teachings at the core of Ramayana. Overall, Adipurush is a messy and disappointing film that fails to do justice to the timeless epic it is based on. It lacks coherence, strong performances, and visual finesse, making it an exhausting and forgettable experience. Save your time and seek out better retellings of the Ramayana story that capture its essence and beauty. Please DO NOT WATCH this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Let me start with something positive. Movie started with a good note and \"Ram Siya Ram\" song gave spiritual pleasure to our ears. Background music and Songs of the movie were really good. But apart from that if I have to say anything about the movie, I must say that makers failed to do their homework while making this epic. Even if we will keep sentiments aside on the name of cinematic liberty, the makers made me feel that they dnt understand cinema. The screenplay is very poor and the dark theme of movie made us feel that we are watching Game of Thrones not Ramayan. Makers made us feel that during Banawaas time of Lord Ram, Surya Dev also went on exile. VFX, CGI and other visual effects were very poor which forced us to think where they have spent 550 crore. Was that even the real budget of the movie or just some Random numbers were given to create hype. Movie makers need to understand that in big budget movie, if money is being spent on paying the fee of movie stars then we cant make a good cinema. Good cinema can only be made if budget is being spent more on VFX, Dialogue writing, CGI etc. And less on paying fee of actors.\n\nTalking about actors the selection of Case were horrible. No offence to Prabhas obviously he is one of the biggest star of the Country but he don't look like Lord Ram from any angle. Off course the beauty of Kriti Sanon is exceptional but for Goddess Sita we need beauty plus someone who is having Indian Look. Extra sharp feature of Kriti failing her to look like Sita. Selecting Saif as Ravana is perhaps biggest selection disaster of history of movie Industry. O n top of that giving him Khilji like look just poured Ghee in the Fire. In my opinion if they would have selected Rajat Tokas as Lord Ram and Shweta Basu Prasad as Mata Sita, that would have been perfect selection. These two are not less than anyone when it comes to acting and also they would not have charged like Prabhas and Kriti. That money could have been spent on VFX, CGI and other Visuals so that at least we would have got some visual treat.\n\nIf I have to talk about performances, Kriti somewhere did justice with Sita Mata character. But she couldn't able to do much because of her limited presence on Screen. Prabhas tried his best. He even did justice of his star power but he miserable failed to made us feel the presence of Lord Ram on big screen. His flat expression throughout the movie has made the things even worst and we couldn't able to connect ourselves from the movie. About Saif as Ravan, I literally have no words. Trailer made me feel that he must have done good performance wise but witnessing him in this character on big screen was most horrible part of the movie. If we will try to ignore his looks and appearance on the name of Cinematic Liberty, his performance made things even more worse. He was walking like a thanos and his dialogue delivery was soo poor that his presence on screen was causing irritation.\n\nAt last I will only say , please keep yourself away from Adipurush. If you want to show story of Lord Ram to your children, better to go with 'Ramayan of Ramananda Sager'or even Japanese Cartoon movie 'The Legend of Prince Ram'."

        "review_detailed_main": "I recently had the unfortunate experience of watching the highly anticipated film, Adipurush, and I must say it was an absolute letdown. The movie promised a grand retelling of a legendary tale, but what unfolded on the screen was a mishmash of bad acting, poor casting choices, and blatant MANIPULATION of sentiments. The film's bad casting choices, poor acting, and the deeply concerning DISREGARD FOR CULTURAL sentiments make it an utterly disappointing experience.\n\nHowever, what truly exacerbates the film's shortcomings is its blatant disregard for cultural sentiments. Adipurush takes a revered mythological tale and distorts it, causing deep offense to those who hold it dear. Instead of treating the source material with respect and sensitivity, the film takes liberties that are not only unnecessary but also disrespectful.\n\nBy altering the storyline and characters, Adipurush needlessly hurts the sentiments of a significant portion of the audience. It demonstrates a lack of understanding and empathy towards the cultural significance of the narrative it attempts to depict. This insensitivity is both disappointing and deeply concerning. It becomes difficult to invest in a film when it fails to connect with the audience emotionally and remains ignorant of the cultural context it attempts to portray.\n\nIn conclusion, Adipurush is a deeply unsatisfying film that disappoints on multiple levels. Its bad casting choices and lackluster performances diminish the viewing experience, while its insensitivity towards cultural sentiments further exacerbates the film's flaws. I cannot recommend this film to anyone looking for a meaningful cinematic experience, as it falls short in every regard."

Nepal has its own distinct cultural heritage, and it was never a part of India.\n\nOverall, these shortcomings in CGI effects, dialogue presentation, and originality of the storyline detract from the movie's overall quality. Viewers seeking a more engaging and authentic cinematic experience may find themselves disappointed. It is advisable to approach this film with lowered expectations and consider exploring alternative options that better meet your preferences."

I have wasted three hours of my life and I want that you don't, so please don't watch that movie instead watch the real ramayan, the one on durdanshan. Hanuman ji has been made so sill and rather should've been made more strong and more realistic, he just seems like another human holding air in its mouth. Ravan has also been made silly.

If the young minds of today get their understanding of Valmiki Ramayana from this movie then I don't know what will happen in near future.\n\nIf this will be their Raavan then i don't know what exactly will they think of Ramayana in the first place. Absolutely lack luster VFX isn't the only problem with this film. Rather VFX is much less of a problem in this movie. The main flaw is in this representation that has been made by the makers. Raavan has an attire of an islamic dictator. He has been shown wearing a t-shirt along with leather straps over him with spiky hairstyle and rather non-sense get up. He is shown riding a bat but there is no mention of why he is riding a bat, is that pushpak vimaan or what. Characters around him are just goofy men or rather cartoons in his army who behave like lord of the rings character. Indrajit is shown as a guy having powers of Flash and attire of Connor McGregor. I can't imagine this being Ramayana.\n\nThe first point of Introduction of Rama is pathetic. Shree Ram is shown as fighting some random CGI demons. Who are they? Why are they attacking Sita? Nothing is told as if it's a cartoon film. Even with such a story like that of Ramayana, Raavana's motivations are so childish and vague that we still don't know what he wants. We are shown a scene worth of 2 mins where Ravana's sister gets her nose cut by Laxman's arrow. That scene is so childish. Every detail about Rama's vanvaas is shown to us in a 3 minutes introduction. The movie doesn't want you to connect with any character. The most connected I was to a character was Jatayu which was just for a 3 minutes CGI sequence. Still I was more connected to it than Sita maa, Shree Ram or any one else."

        "review_title": "A 2023 film with CGI which appears to have been created in 2000!",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Adipurush\" is a film based on \"The Ramayana\" attributed to Valmiki. It is a holy text, a saga revered by Hindus and Buddhists alike. And, apparently, the film offended many of these people...much like a poor depiction of Muhammad or Jesus would offend many.\n\nUnfortunately, I am NOT a Hindu or Buddhist and my knowledge of \"The Ramayana\" is poor (good for an American...but that says little). So, the parts that offend many are parts of the film I might not even notice. Also, because I am from a different cultural and religious background, I might somehow misinterpret or misunderstand some parts of the movie...and I apologize in advance for this.\n\nThe story is about Rama and was first written down 27-28 centuries ago. In the saga, Ram is sent into exile for 14 years...taking his wife and brother with him. During this time, they have many adventures, battle demons and much more. However, what happened to Ram BEFORE the exile and much of the context for the story appears to be missing.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about the film was how horrible the CGI was in the movie...and there is a LOT of CGI. Many of the scenes honestly look like PS2 or PS3 cut scenes...scenes made 15-20 years ago instead of in 2023 like this film. A couple striking examples occur early in the movie. In one, two actors are clumsily superimposed into a mountain top snow scene. In another, demons attack Ram and it looks just horrid....as if some untalented student did the CGI. So, apart from religious problems, the film just looks terrible and having real live non-CGI actors and practical effects might have cost more...but it would have looked so much better.\n\nBy comparison, I saw \"Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within\" about a week ago and its CGI was better and often more realistic than \"Adipurush\"...and the Final Fantasy movie debute in 2001!!!\n\nSo what DID I like about the film? Well, the music was appropriately epic and pretty amazing (hence it earns a 2 instead of 1). Otherwise, I noticed nothing good about the movie whatsoever. I think I'd have been better off just reading \"The Ramayana\" or at least a Wikipedia summary of it."

It's a fight of ram for his beloved wife who was adbucted by Ravan . Am sure if om had taken film and designed characters as we know it , it would have not even reached 50cr collection.\n\nIt's a visual epic, all my family enjoyed film and appreciate the effort Om and his team put in. There are some issues with film like the fight could have been 15 min shorter and huppa huya sing would have been added. Instead of designing ravana army like comic characters they could have been in human formats with rakshak attire .. & ravana is demon he can have many forms and many hair styles there is nothing wrong in it ..no body is sure how ravana used to look .. when will smith made Jesus character or when askhay made Krishna's character did we comment on their outlook .. it's a film made for future kids and portrayed characters as superheroes.. I don't think anyone would have made adipurush better than what it is .. however only lack is at the time of promotions team could have taken care with kid format marketing and portraying vanarsaina etc."

And leave about ravan is he even a ravan . It looks like the ravan spends all his time in the saloon . The ravan wears a t shirt and has a boy cut with blade hair cut . And that indrajeet he looked no less than an African. Don't you dare to go to the lanka like since our childhood we all have heard that \" Ravan ki sone ki Lanka thi \" and here they have build an Asgard Lanka . This movie has kingkongs , thanos , even Avenger characters and what not . Specially that scene in which ravan wears a helmet and was forging a sword like a swordsmith .

The acting is subpar, with the actors delivering their lines in a monotone and uninspired manner. The special effects are laughable and look like they were created on a shoestring budget.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Adipurush\" stands as a grave disappointment, offering one of the worst representations of the epic Ramayana that I have seen to date. The mischaracterizations, sloppy storyline, and inaccurate representations make for a film that does not do justice to the epic it attempts to retell.\n\nThe leading actor's portrayal of the principal character is lackluster and fails to capture the essence of the role. This discrepancy is evident in every frame, making the performance not just forgettable but also deeply frustrating.\n\nHowever, the greatest fault of \"Adipurush\" lies in its depiction of Ravan and his ethnicity. Traditionally known as dark-skinned Rakshashas, the portrayal of Ravan as a light-skinned Northerner is a considerable misrepresentation that undermines the rich diversity of our epics. This inaccurate depiction feels like a forced attempt to align the characters of Ravan and Ram, which doesn't resonate with the epic's true spirit.\n\nDespite these glaring issues, Saif Ali Khan's performance is a silver lining. He delivers a strong portrayal and proves his mettle as an actor. But, his casting as Ravan feels misplaced; given his strong performance, he would have been better suited for the roles of Ram or Hanuman.\n\nThe narrative of \"Adipurush\" is equally disappointing. The storyline is sloppy and riddled with plot inconsistencies, creating an experience that is more confusing than engaging.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Adipurush\" is a poor adaptation that fails on multiple fronts. It misrepresents the characters of the Ramayana and fails to deliver a coherent and engaging storyline. Despite Saif Ali Khan's commendable performance, the film remains a cinematic misfire. It serves as a grim reminder of the responsibility that comes with adapting beloved epics. We can only hope that future attempts will be more considerate and accurate in their portrayals."

Whoever chose the cast did an absolute injutice to the movie,prabhas is the worst possible choice for lord Ram,no expresions, they tried very hard to distort the facts throughout the movie, Ravana is shown as meat eater and in completely opposite manner,even Lord Hanuman is shown in bad light, funny character using slangs as a way to communicate throughout the film, the director and writer should be ashamed of themselves for playing with the religious sentiments of the majority in India. This film needs to be banned."

        "review_detailed_main": "Trash - Ramayana, Bhagavatha, Mahabarath are not mythological stories but they are our history n pride. In the name of westernisation or improvisation or direction liberties please do not spoil the soul of our history. For example Lakshmana knows about his brother in and out and never question Rama n his values but in this movie you will see lakshmana doing that. It was Sushena who told to bring sanjeeva but not Sarama(Vibhishana's wife - who actually stayed in Ravana Lanka when her husband was with Lord Rama) and many more. You may ask or question me about recent English adaptions of the epic by Amish Tripati, Anand Neelakantan and Devdutt Patnaik but they did not spoil the soul but the way of telling Ramayana in different person view for example Asura was telling Ramayana from Ravana's Angle. So I here I do not want to talk much about story as everyone have minimum knowledge of Ramayan. So, coming to technicalities Om Raut might be a worshiper of 300 movie because you won't see much light in the movie and everything happens in grey / dark shades(one should remember in Tretayug dharma with four padas and battle happens in morning only though Ravana was rakshas), very poor vfx, heroic elevation which are not required for this story, Poor lighting, Poor Costume only positive is BGM. There is so much scope for emotions in Ramayana but Om Raut changes in stories( Sita maata apaharan episode(you don't believe it happened in front of Rama according to OM Raut), Jatayu episode, Sabari episode, Vali episode, Rama setu episode and much more) sorry again diverted into story - couldn't help it. So it's a trash in the name of Ramayana. I really don't care who played character Rama but I care about how the Ramayana was narrated."

The blatant disregard for retaining the original character personalities is appalling. Ravan, a Brahmin devotee of Shiv, known for his vegetarianism, is completely transformed in this movie, which not only disrespects the original mythology but also has the potential to hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus.\n\nLet's talk about the VFX, or rather the lack thereof. Despite having a higher budget than Brahmastra, Adipurush fails to achieve even a fraction of the visual effects quality. It's clear that more effort should have been put into fixing the VFX instead of just superficially color grading the scenes."

This movie is literally a example of how the flim should not be. I have watch this, and I literally request you not to go for this movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "Adipurush, a highly anticipated 3D movie adaptation of the revered Indian epic Ramayana, falls short of expectations and fails to do justice to the beloved story. The film starts with a promising rendition of the Ram Siya Ram song, accompanied by beautiful illustrations. However, the movie quickly devolves into a disgraceful portrayal of the epic narrative.\n\nThe cast's performances come across as forced, with Kriti lacking the motherly aura of Sita Mata and Prabhas seemingly trapped in his Bahubali phase. Saif Ali Khan's portrayal of Ravan is criticized for resembling a character from a DJ concert rather than a formidable antagonist.\n\nSeveral aspects of the movie are deeply disturbing. The language used in the dialogues, such as Hanumanji's disrespectful lines, feels offensive towards a revered deity. The film takes liberties with the story, introducing inaccurate and exaggerated elements, such as Ravana's anaconda massage and the depiction of him feeding meat to the bat (which on the first place is a question marks because apparently Pushpak Viman is replaced by a creepy bat) which contradicts his Brahmin background.\n\nFurthermore, the movie includes a random erotic scene, where an unknown woman is shown along with Vibhishan, and subsequently, the woman is shown changing clothes while Vibhishan is present nearby. This scene seems unnecessary and out of place in a narrative centered on a revered epic.\n\nOverall, Adipurush fails to maintain emotional connection with the audience and strays far from the original story of Ramayana. Its poor writing, lack of authenticity, and departure from the essence of the epic are notable drawbacks. The only redeeming aspect is the music composed by Ajay Atul, which receives praise for its quality.\n\nConsidering the movie's shortcomings and offensive content, it is not recommended to spend time and money on watching Adipurush in theaters. The film's attempts at modernizing the epic story result in a disrespectful portrayal that may disappoint and alienate audiences who hold Ramayana dear."

Saif Ali Khan's portrayal of Ravan lacks the larger-than-life presence the character demands, with a laughable hairstyle and pathetic costumes. Kriti Sanon fails to capture the essence of Sita Mata, while Prabhas' portrayal of Lord Ram is a disgrace, lacking the nobility and composure associated with the revered figure.\n\nDirector Om Raut's ineptitude is evident, with poor direction, a lackluster screenplay, and cringe-worthy dialogues. The film's exorbitant budget is wasted on subpar VFX and graphics that would be better suited to a high school project.\n\nAdipurush not only defames the history of India and Maryada Purushottam Shri Ram but also showcases a shocking level of depravity. The filmmakers insult the holy Ramayana and its characters, with no respect for the cultural values they represent.\n\nI urge all Hindus to boycott this movie, as it distorts our mythology and insults our scriptures. Adipurush is a disgraceful attempt at storytelling that should be avoided. Instead, turn to the authentic glory of the Ramayana in its original texts."

There are plenty of sources for reference be it in Telugu film industry, Hindi film industry, Ramayana by Ramanand sagar or any anime or cartoon shows. They all have been legendary and have done an exemplary and sincere job at capturing the true beauty of Ramayana. Here, the scripture has been completely distorted for fulfilling the whims and fancies of the director. Too much creative liberty must not be attempted in historical and mythological projects as it makes the credibility of the entire film questionable which was the case in this film. The trailer itself was disappointing. The dialogues are absolutely horrible, making it too casual and slang filled for a divine project. In many of the dialogues even the original references and meanings have been distorted. Costumes, settings, Vfx nothing is up to the mark. Extremely disappointing. Even the actors' potential was not used to its fullest. Please avoid this movie! Its a waste of time. This is the worst portrayal of Ramayana ever in India."

Really disappointed, need to improve all the actors acting as well as the manipulated story should be shutdown as soon as possible........ And also the movie is released world wide, can't even imagine the other country people will think this is Ramayana........ Need to ban this movie and if possible need to make another movie with all the purity which Sri Ram was having...... We don't need to modernize our history....."

About 2h30 of it was without dialogues and/or acting.

I wish they used the most commonly used names like Sita, Rama, Lakshmana and Anjaneya/ Hanuma. \"Seshu\" felt super weird.\n\n4. I wish Janki's outfits were a bit more traditional.\n\n5. The action sequences felt like they were taken from a poor game version of the Lord of the rings or something. I don't wanna insult the Lord of the rings. Sorry, fans!\n\n6. There were many parts on the movie that didn't make sense. The scenes didn't convey the entire story or the essence of it properly."

        "review_detailed_main": "Aadipurush, the much-anticipated mythological epic, falls flat on its face, leaving audiences with a sense of profound disappointment and dissatisfaction. Directed by a renowned filmmaker, one would expect a masterpiece that transcends boundaries and delivers an immersive experience. Unfortunately, this film fails to live up to even the most basic expectations, making it one of the worst movies of 2023.\n\nOne of the most glaring issues with Aadipurush is its lackluster execution. Despite its ambitious premise, the film fails to create a captivating mythological world. The production design feels uninspired and lacks attention to detail. The sets and costumes appear generic and fail to transport viewers into the mythical era they are meant to represent. The visual effects, touted as one of the film's strengths, are underwhelming, with poorly rendered CGI that often takes viewers out of the experience rather than enhancing it.\n\nThe performances in Aadipurush are equally disappointing. Prabhas, in the role of Lord Rama, delivers a wooden and uninspiring portrayal. His lack of emotional depth and charisma make it difficult to connect with his character, leaving a void at the center of the narrative. Saif Ali Khan's Ravana, touted as a revelation, is nothing more than a caricature of evil, lacking the complexity and depth needed to make the character truly memorable. The chemistry between the leads is non-existent, and their encounters feel forced and devoid of any genuine emotion.\n\nThe screenplay of Aadipurush fails to bring anything new or thought-provoking to the table. It follows a predictable narrative trajectory that offers no surprises or innovative twists. The dialogue is often trite and lacks impact, failing to leave a lasting impression. Additionally, the film suffers from pacing issues, with several scenes feeling unnecessarily dragged out, resulting in a bloated runtime that tests the audience's patience.\n\nWhile mythological films often have the potential to explore timeless themes and provide social commentary, Aadipurush falls short in this regard. It fails to offer any fresh perspective or relevance to the contemporary world, making the narrative feel hollow and disconnected from the audience's reality. The film relies too heavily on the familiarity of the source material, assuming that the audience's prior knowledge will fill in the gaps and compensate for the lack of depth in the storytelling.\n\nMoreover, Aadipurush suffers from poor editing choices. There are jarring cuts between scenes, disrupting the flow and coherence of the narrative. The film lacks a strong editorial hand, resulting in a disjointed experience that feels like a collection of loosely connected scenes rather than a cohesive story.\n\nIn conclusion, Aadipurush is a colossal disappointment and unquestionably one of the worst movies of 2023. Its lackluster execution, uninspired production design, and underwhelming performances make it a forgettable addition to the genre of mythological epics. The film fails to deliver on its promise of a grand cinematic experience and falls short in every aspect that matters: storytelling, visuals, performances, and emotional engagement.\n\nAs audiences, we deserve better than Aadipurush. It serves as a cautionary tale of how even the most promising projects can go astray when not executed with care and creativity. This film will only leave viewers longing for a more compelling and imaginative retelling of the mythological tale it attempts to portray. It is best to avoid Aadipurush and seek out other cinematic experiences that truly resonate and leave a lasting impact."

If anyone select such topic to play it on cinema please very careful because the believes , love, sentiments has very closed to by heart of the people around this world you can win but one day on fail I am dam sure!\n\nMakers tried so much to make it more entertaining which was not required actually , Adipurush makers or on the other hands i would say \"razor in monkey's hand\"\n\nStupidity, Foolishness, baselessness described of Lord Rama story by Adipurush.\n\nJao Jao Ramayana padho Bhawanaao ka Alingan Karo. Chahye thoda sa hi bhagwan ram ki jeevani ka vivran kartey film mein per tarike se karte poorna bhakti ke saath Kaam Banjata Ramji Ki Kasam.

        "review_detailed_main": "Audiences are treated to a frustratingly subpar cinematic experience. From cringe-worthy dialogues to underdeveloped characters, this film fails to capture the essence of the beloved epic. Its third-grade VFX and a misleading storyline further contribute to its disappointing overall presentation.\n\nOne of the most glaring issues with this adaptation is its dialogues. Instead of maintaining the grace and power of the original text, the script falls flat with cringe-worthy lines that do not resonate with the viewer. The lack of depth and meaningful conversations among the characters further undermines the emotional connection that audiences seek.\n\nCharacter strength, a crucial aspect in any adaptation, is sorely lacking in this film. The iconic figures of Ram, Sita, and Hanuman, known for their unwavering determination and inner strength, are portrayed weakly and devoid of their defining qualities. This stripping of character depth robs the narrative of its intended impact and robs the audience of the opportunity to connect with these legendary personas.\n\nThe visual effects in this adaptation are a letdown, to say the least. With outdated and poorly executed CGI, the film fails to bring the mythical world of Ramayana to life. Instead of immersing the audience in the grandeur and magic of the epic, the lackluster VFX further distances viewers from the intended experience.\n\nAdding to the disappointment is the film's misleading storyline. It deviates from the original narrative, leaving audiences confused and disconnected. Instead of staying true to the moral dilemmas and intricate relationships portrayed in Ramayana, this adaptation opts for a shallow and contrived plot that fails to engage or inspire.\n\nIn conclusion, this adaptation of Ramayana falls short on multiple fronts. The cringe-worthy dialogues, lack of character strength, underwhelming VFX, and misleading story all contribute to a film that fails to capture the heart and soul of the epic. It disappoints both fans of the original text and those seeking a compelling cinematic experience. Sadly, this rendition misses the mark and ultimately leaves audiences feeling unsatisfied."

Also Ram sees sita being kidnapped, totally mocked the whole sense of ramayana. Also an exotic scene with vibhisan and his wife. Ram sita re a bit intimate. Hanuman is just a comedy character. Sushen vaidya is a female and also looks like a hot figure rather than a vaidya. Indrajeet, laxman are totally ruined. Prominent charcters like jamvant, nal nil all are animated and have vanished like other vanars which they depicted as monkeys.\n\nIt feels that the crew has intentionally ruined the story, divinity, characters, language, theme, simplicity and reality of Ramayana. I sorry, it doesn't feel but it is the reality. This movie needs to be banned and also actions should be taken against whole crew by the society and the law."

The writing is abysmal, the direction is atrocious, and the visual effects are horrendous. To make matters worse, the film incorporates sleazy and repugnant content. The lead actor's portrayal falls flat, looks like a FAT Halwai rather than the revered Shri Ram. Prabhas, in his role as Shri Ram, lacks any semblance of expression and comes across as wooden. Saif, playing Ravan, fails to bring any depth to the character and instead resorts to a growling and malevolent persona. Sunny Singh's portrayal of Laxman is devoid of emotion, as he remains stone-faced throughout. The depiction of Hanuman is utterly appalling, with the actor portraying as a foul mouth showing a complete disregard for the greatness of the character. In summary, this film is a complete affront to the essence of Ramayana and should never be endorsed with your hard-earned money,. Prabhas, Om Raut, Manoj Muntashir, and T-Series should hang their heads in shame for their involvement in this project. DONOT WATCH THIS IN THEATERS."

        "review_detailed_main": "Adipurush, touted as a grand retelling of a beloved mythological tale, falls short of even the most basic expectations. From casting to makeup, dialogues to visual effects, every aspect of this film is marred by poor execution and a lack of creative vision. It is a clear example of how not to adapt a mythological story for the big screen.\n\nOne of the glaring issues with Adipurush lies in its casting choices. The actors seem miscast, lacking the charisma and depth necessary to bring these legendary characters to life. Their performances are unconvincing and fail to evoke any emotional connection with the audience. The lackluster makeup only exacerbates the problem, leaving the characters looking artificial and out of place in their own world.\n\nThe dialogues in Adipurush are cringe-worthy at best. They lack depth, creativity, and any semblance of poetic beauty that is typically associated with mythological storytelling. Instead, the dialogue feels forced and poorly written, leaving the actors struggling to deliver them with conviction. The result is an overall lack of impact in crucial scenes and a disconnection between the audience and the narrative.\n\nPerhaps the most disappointing aspect of Adipurush is its visual effects. In an era where groundbreaking CGI and VFX have become the norm, this film falls embarrassingly short. The effects appear amateurish and distractingly artificial, robbing the epic battles of any sense of awe or excitement. It feels like a step back in time rather than a leap forward in cinematic technology.\n\nThe narrative itself lacks coherence and fails to explore the depth and complexity of the original mythological story it is based on. It feels like a shallow and hastily put together retelling, with key elements missing or diluted. This lack of attention to detail undermines the film's credibility and leaves the audience longing for a more faithful and engaging adaptation.\n\nIn conclusion, Adipurush is an abysmal movie that fails on multiple fronts. Its poor casting, subpar makeup, cringe-worthy dialogues, and lackluster visual effects make for an unpleasant cinematic experience. It falls short of capturing the essence and grandeur of the mythological story it attempts to retell. Save yourself the disappointment and avoid this misguided and poorly executed film at all costs."

If we want a depiction of Ramayana at least it should have well-respected dialogues. It seems as if the writer was suggested not to write good dialogue and make the film a flop.\n\nThe Ravana's heads were divided into two parts one line contains 5 heads and the other line contains the rest... that was epic. None of the other characters except ShreeRam, Hanuman, and Ravana from the Ramayana were celebrated enough to make the viewers understand their importance.\n\nIt is so badly written and directed that when you search on youtube for the \"Spoof of Ramayana\", the first answer is Adipurush. I think now the genre of the film should be changed to comedy."

        "review_detailed_main": "Story: Ramayan is an epic, which every Indian knows by heart. The story involves the biggest God of the third most populous religion in the world. Rewriting such a thing is one of the biggest mistakes.\n\nE.g. Shabri placement was wrong, vaidya sushen was replaced by a seductive lady, Rawan shown as lord of Bats, pushpak viman replaced by a dragon, langur resembling army of Sugreev replaced by many different breeds of monkeys, Meghnad becomes Flash from Hollywood. The whole movie is full of goof ups.\n\nDialogues: not up to mark. A much more decent language was expected.\n\nDevelopment of Characters: each character in Ramayan is very beautifully developed. But Adipurush was not able to develop even a single character. Hanuman ji, Ravan, Sugreev, meghnad and all others needed some better representation. The movie disappointed me here. The movie wasted more than half an hour panning and zooming on Ram and Rawan from different angles. It became so boring that we felt like having a remote to forward the scenes. Unfortunately we were in theatre.\n\nMusic: Background score was cacophonic. With the story so long you don't have a place for a song sequence but they decided to insert some extremely forgettable songs.\n\nComputer Graphics: It felt like the whole movie was shot on a green screen. The movie was full of animations and animations were poorer than the first Harry Potter. Low FPS was really disappointing.\n\nDirection: It can simply compete in the most poorly directed movies/play/tv show ever made, based on Ramayan.\n\nPicturisation: they have used lots of CG and animation which, as I mentioned is of poor quality. Most of the movie is dark. Lanka is black coloured.\n\nActors: kriti Sannon looks Beautiful, and did justice to her role, Prabhas looks and feels almost like bahubali. Sunny Singh looks unconvincing as a short tempered Laxman. Hanuman's make up was really bad. But the biggest wastage was of one of the finest Actors Saif Ali Khan. The way he was waving his shoulders was strange. All of them are great actors, but it seems like the director got confused in the technology and art of movie making.\n\nOpinion: I normally read IMDB reviews before going to a cinema. But today I specifically downloaded its app to write this review on this movie."

Adipurush is merely a Bollywood-ised version of one of the most epic tales that ever existed. Considering the significance of Ramayana's place in Indian mythology and literature, the directors should have put more of their heart and soul into creating it. Despite the great performance by the actors playing Ram and Hanuman, the movie still is able to show much gloss and not much substance."

The only thing good in this movie is its background music other than that it's a terrible movie. It's nowhere close to real story and it should be shame without mentioning the cast . Casting is terrible I think they paid Prabhas only for his face, from neck to belong everything is cartoon animation, Saif is god of thunder and batman. He can control both both lightning and bats and the crazy part is there's no pushpakaviman. There are bats there are monkeys there are some kind of bat\u00d7dragon creator's some deamons and hell lot of cartoon characters moreover there's flash inspired character and avengers inspired scenes. Can't tolerate this movie. Total rubbish. I think 50% of budget goes to Prabhas for his facial expressions( coz the only thing which is real is his face), he doesn't know how to act he's making his fans fools. I wonder what dedication does his guy have if he can't even make his body good but still need huge remuneration for his ugly work,he should definitely consider quitting his acting career."

        "review_detailed_main": "Where do I even begin with Adipurush? This movie, touted as a magnum opus, turned out to be a colossal disappointment, failing to deliver on every front. From its shallow storytelling to its cringe-worthy performances, it's hard to find any redeeming qualities in this cinematic disaster.\n\nLet's start with the narrative, or lack thereof. Adipurush takes a classic mythological tale and somehow manages to strip it of all depth and substance. The screenplay is convoluted and poorly executed, leaving the audience confused and disconnected from the story. The characters are one-dimensional, devoid of any real emotions or motivations, making it impossible to invest in their journey. It feels as though the writers threw together a mishmash of scenes without any consideration for coherence or logical progression.\n\nTo make matters worse, the performances in Adipurush are abysmal. Prabhas, who has proven his acting prowess in previous films, delivers a lackluster performance as Lord Ram. His portrayal lacks charisma and fails to capture the essence of the character. Saif Ali Khan, as the antagonist Ravana, hams it up to the point of absurdity, delivering cringe-worthy dialogues and over-the-top expressions. The supporting cast does nothing to salvage the film either, with forgettable performances that add no value to the viewing experience.\n\nThe visual effects in Adipurush are a mixed bag. While some sequences are visually stunning and showcase the potential of modern technology, others fall flat and appear cartoonish. The inconsistency is jarring and only further detracts from any sense of immersion in the story. The action sequences, which should have been the film's saving grace, lack impact and fail to evoke any excitement or awe.\n\nAdditionally, the editing of Adipurush leaves much to be desired. The pacing is uneven, with sluggish moments that drag on and abrupt cuts that disrupt the flow of the narrative. It's clear that the filmmakers were more concerned with creating grandiose visuals than crafting a cohesive and engaging film.\n\nLastly, the music and background score, which could have been a saving grace, fail to leave any lasting impression. The songs are forgettable, and the score is generic and uninspired, doing little to elevate the film or enhance the emotional impact of the scenes.\n\nIn conclusion, Adipurush is a prime example of wasted potential. It squanders a compelling mythological tale with its poor storytelling, lackluster performances, inconsistent visual effects, subpar editing, and forgettable music. It's a movie that fails to entertain, engage, or leave any lasting impact on the viewer. Save yourself the disappointment and avoid this cinematic debacle at all costs.\n\nMeanw\n\nWhere do I even begin with Adipurush? This movie, touted as a magnum opus, turned out to be a colossal disappointment, failing to deliver on every front. From its shallow storytelling to its cringe-worthy performances, it's hard to find any redeeming qualities in this cinematic disaster.\n\nLet's start with the narrative, or lack thereof. Adipurush takes a classic mythological tale and somehow manages to strip it of all depth and substance. The screenplay is convoluted and poorly executed, leaving the audience confused and disconnected from the story. The characters are one-dimensional, devoid of any real emotions or motivations, making it impossible to invest in their journey. It feels as though the writers threw together a mishmash of scenes without any consideration for coherence or logical progression.\n\nTo make matters worse, the performances in Adipurush are abysmal. Prabhas, who has proven his acting prowess in previous films, delivers a lackluster performance as Lord Ram. His portrayal lacks charisma and fails to capture the essence of the character. Saif Ali Khan, as the antagonist Ravana, hams it up to the point of absurdity, delivering cringe-worthy dialogues and over-the-top expressions. The supporting cast does nothing to salvage the film either, with forgettable performances that add no value to the viewing experience.\n\nThe visual effects in Adipurush are a mixed bag. While some sequences are visually stunning and showcase the potential of modern technology, others fall flat and appear cartoonish. The inconsistency is jarring and only further detracts from any sense of immersion in the story. The action sequences, which should have been the film's saving grace, lack impact and fail to evoke any excitement or awe.\n\nAdditionally, the editing of Adipurush leaves much to be desired. The pacing is uneven, with sluggish moments that drag on and abrupt cuts that disrupt the flow of the narrative. It's clear that the filmmakers were more concerned with creating grandiose visuals than crafting a cohesive and engaging film.\n\nLastly, the music and background score, which could have been a saving grace, fail to leave any lasting impression. The songs are forgettable, and the score is generic and uninspired, doing little to elevate the film or enhance the emotional impact of the scenes.\n\nIn conclusion, Adipurush is a prime example of wasted potential. It squanders a compelling mythological tale with its poor storytelling, lackluster performances, inconsistent visual effects, subpar editing, and forgettable music. It's a movie that fails to entertain, engage, or leave any lasting impact on the viewer. Save yourself the disappointment and avoid this cinematic debacle at all costs.\n\nUser Some More misguided Fact in adipurush movie\n\nChatGPT I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have real-time information or access to specific details about movies released after my knowledge cutoff in September 2021.

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of the most disgusting adaption of a story with great religious & historical importance.\n\nI guess the main intention of this movie was only to convert all the illegally earned money by the director/producers into legal investment & declare loss to avoid paying taxes.\n\nCan't blame the actors for this abomination. They tried to play their roles in the best way possible. Hence the 2 star that I've given. It's only the crew who has to be blamed for this.\n\nFeels like the entire movie has been shot inside a bedroom or a small hall & to that the most pathetic & disgusting CGI is added. It costed ISRO 450cr for the Mangalyaan mission which benefited India & the scientists in its studies for about 10-15 years. This movie costing 600cr couldn't even have proper CGI. The 1987 Ramayana television series had better CGI than this.\n\nWhy rename the three leads, i.e. Ram, Sita & Laksmana while the names of the rest of the characters remain the same/original.\n\nThe Dialogues.... Oh My God!!! How did the CBFC approve this movie with such rubbish dialogues. It's More like a third grade standard less movie dialogues.\n\nTo be honest there are much better historical adoptions made in a much better & economical way. The 1992 Japanese adoption of Ramayana had been produced & directed in the most respectable manner.\n\nGuys, please don't spend your valuable money on this so called movie. It's an insult to the movie industry. Save it so that you can spend on a different & more valuable movie. I could barely keep my eyes open for half the movie and I forced myself out of the theatre.\n\nI don't know what is wrong with Indian Cinema. The quality of its content is deteriorating movie by movie. Just adding big names to the cast list is not going to make the movie a success. Proper direction, screenplay, production, dialogues, etc, all contributes to a movies success. Most of the historically important stories are being adopted & portrayed in a wrong way or by the wrong cast."

        "review_detailed_main": "Adipurush, directed by Om Raut, falls short of expectations as it attempts to condense the vast episodes of the mythological epic into a three-hour movie. The overly tight plot sacrifices crucial storytelling elements, resulting in a fragmented and confusing narrative that fails to do justice to the original story.\n\nThe storyline of Adipurush had to solely revolve around the abduction of Maa Sita by Ravana and Lord Rama's subsequent efforts to rescue her with the help of Hanuman and his followers. Unfortunately, the movie neglects to establish a cohesive track of events, leaving audiences feeling disconnected and bewildered. The lack of attention to the \"how\" and \"what\" aspects of the story further compounds the issue, leaving viewers craving a deeper exploration of the characters and their motivations.\n\nDespite boasting a talented cast, Adipurush disappointingly underutilizes and misrepresents its ensemble. The potential of the actors remains largely untapped, resulting in shallow and unconvincing character portrayals. It is disheartening to witness such a group of performers not being given the opportunity to shine.\n\nThe dialogues in Adipurush drastically fail to evoke the emotional depth and resonance expected from a mythological epic. The writing feels loose and uninspired, lacking the power to truly engage the audience. The dialogues are a missed opportunity to connect with the viewers on a deeper level and leave them emotionally invested in the story.\n\nThe usage of technology in Adipurush is a significant letdown. Rather than enhancing the movie, it appears to detract from the overall experience. The execution of the visual effects and other technological elements feels forced and out of place, detracting from the authenticity and charm of the story.\n\nIn conclusion, Adipurush is a disappointing adaptation of a revered epic. The overly tight plot, lack of a coherent storyline, underutilized cast, weak dialogues, and mishandled technology all contribute to a subpar cinematic experience. With a rating of one star out of ten, it is difficult to recommend this movie to anyone seeking a faithful and immersive retelling of the Ramayana."

Instead of presenting a thoughtful and respectful portrayal of Hindu practices, they resort to shallow stereotypes, distortion of facts, and a blatant disregard for accuracy.\n\nThe movie shamelessly appropriates Hindu rituals and symbols without any understanding or reverence for their true meaning. These aspects, which hold immense importance to millions of people, are reduced to mere caricatures and cheap gags, ultimately serving no purpose other than to mock and belittle a deeply cherished faith.\n\nMoreover, the film's storyline is riddled with inaccuracies and misinterpretations of Hindu mythology and history. It presents a skewed and distorted version of Hindu deities and their stories, further adding insult to injury. The careless and irresponsible handling of these sacred narratives only serves to perpetuate ignorance and misconceptions about Hinduism among viewers who may not have a deeper understanding of the religion.\n\nFilmmakers have a responsibility to exercise cultural sensitivity and ensure that their work does not harm or offend any religious or cultural group. Unfortunately, \"Adipurush\" fails miserably in this regard. It is a clear example of how commercial interests and shock value have taken precedence over basic decency and respect for religious sentiments.\n\nI strongly advise individuals who hold Hindu beliefs dear to avoid watching this movie. By doing so, we can send a powerful message to the film industry that such careless and offensive depictions of religious practices and beliefs are unacceptable. Let us stand together against the denigration of any religion and demand responsible filmmaking that promotes understanding and respect for all faiths."

The director, Om Raut, tried to make something great, but it didn't work out. The movie has lots of money spent on it, so it looks nice, but even that can't hide the problems. Prabhas, who is a good actor, is in the movie, but the story doesn't let him show his talent. Saif Ali Khan plays the bad guy, but his character is not interesting.\n\nThe exciting fights in the movie should be fun, but they are not. They are boring and don't make you feel excited. The computer-made special effects also look fake and not real. The actors Kriti Sanon, Sunny Singh, and Devdutta Nage also don't do a good job. It's not their fault entirely; the story they have to act in is not good. The movie is in two languages, Hindi and Telugu, but this makes things worse. Sometimes, the talking and the actions don't match, and it's hard to feel connected to the story. Aadipurush tries to be a new version of the old story, but it forgets what made the story special. It cares more about looking cool than telling a good story. This is a problem because the original story is about important things like feelings and lessons.\n\nTo sum up, Aadipurush is a big disappointment. Even though it looks nice and has famous actors, it doesn't tell a good story. The fights are not fun, the acting is not great, and it forgets what made the old story special. It's a lesson in how not to make a good movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Film Review: Adipurush (2023) - A Missed Opportunity - Review by Kalyug Briefs\n\nAdipurush, a highly anticipated film based on the epic Ramayana, falls short of expectations, leaving audiences disappointed. Despite the potential to showcase divine miracles and captivate viewers with stunning special effects, the film fails to make maximum use of 3D animation and visual effects, ultimately diluting the grandeur of the Indian epic.\n\nOne of the main issues with Adipurush is the missed opportunity to fully exploit the rich source material. Ramayana is a treasure trove of extraordinary events and mythical occurrences, which could have been visually spectacular on the big screen. Unfortunately, the film's director seems to have overlooked this aspect, resulting in a lackluster representation of the epic.\n\nFor those familiar with the Ramayana, either through personal study or as part of their school curriculum, Adipurush may come as a disappointment. The film appears to have made significant changes to the original narrative, altering the essence of the story. This can be disconcerting, especially for younger audiences who are just beginning to explore and understand their cultural heritage. Instead of being a faithful adaptation, the film seems more like a 3D animation ape-man game, filled with excessive fighting scenes that overshadow the depth and philosophical underpinnings of the Ramayana.\n\nOne glaring issue is the lack of strong and memorable dialogues. It appears that the director either did not have the resources to hire a competent screenplay writer or failed to prioritize the importance of well-crafted dialogue. As a result, the film feels devoid of meaningful conversations and fails to engage the audience on an emotional level. The budget seemingly prioritized cut-and-paste 3D models from other games or sources, further undermining the film's storytelling potential.\n\nWhile Adipurush may boast impressive visuals and a promising premise, it ultimately fails to deliver a compelling cinematic experience. Viewers yearning for a faithful adaptation of the Ramayana will be left disappointed, as the film overlooks the epic's divine miracles and profound teachings. Furthermore, the lack of strong dialogues and excessive focus on action sequences detract from the film's overall impact.\n\nIn conclusion, Adipurush falls short of its potential to bring the grandeur of the Ramayana to the big screen. The film's missed opportunities, lack of faithful storytelling, and underdeveloped dialogues make it a disappointing experience for both fans of the epic and those seeking an immersive cinematic journey."

This movie should serve as a remainder that Outrageous Budget and Arrogance and being from a large production house doesn't give you the ticket to demolish the glorious Hindu History.\n\nOn front of story telling, How can you mess up Ramayana, you have literally thousands of source materials with such accuracy.\n\nSecond of All , the screenplay, its too loose, its lazy, it is hurtful. Dialogues are shambolic.\n\nOnly saving grace. There is score by Ajay Atul Sir which atleast gives you a Audio therapy.\n\nShame on the director, the production house and the writers and all creative personnel associated with this film."

VFX is the worst.\n\nI couldn't believe why they would release such kind of a product. If the young minds of today get their understanding of Valmiki Ramayana from this movie then I don't know what will happen in near future.\n\nIf this will be their Raavan then i don't know what exactly will they think of Ramayana in the first place. Absolutely lack luster VFX isn't the only problem with this film. Rather VFX is much less of a problem in this movie. The main flaw is in this representation that has been made by the makers. Raavan has an attire of an islamic dictator. He has been shown wearing a t-shirt along with leather straps over him with spiky hairstyle and rather non-sense get up. He is shown riding a bat but there is no mention of why he is riding a bat, is that pushpak vimaan or what. Characters around him are just goofy men or rather cartoons in his army who behave like lord of the rings character. Indrajit is shown as a guy having powers of Flash and attire of Connor McGregor. I can't imagine this being Ramayana."

In contrast, this 600 Cr. Adaptation failed to summon the same emotionally charged reactions; the senses of divine affection are gone, and surrealism is nowhere to be found, mainly because of the lack of respect shown towards the source material.

I also love the part where a person with incredible speed comes. It looked like something out of Marvel or DC. I thought effects like these only worked in anime or any type of animation, but I was clearly proved wrong. It turns out that the effects were actually good and that the animation worked out and looked good towards the final presentation. Wow man, just wow. I love this movie and this is definitely underrated. 10/10! If I had chance to give this movie an Oscar, I would. I recommend this to everyone who seeks interest in action and history.

The portrayal of Lord Hanuman with roadside-style dialogues and the underutilization of Lord Laxman leave much to be desired. Prabhas' performance as Lord Ram lacks expression and emotional depth. However, Saif Ali Khan stands out as a convincing Raavan, while Kriti Sanon's limited screen time hampers her portrayal of Sita. The visual effects appear cartoonish, and the soundtrack fails to evoke the necessary emotions. Overall, \"Adipurush\" fails to capture the emotional resonance and character depth of the Ramayana, making it a disappointing adaptation."

It's clear that the makers of this film were more interested in a quick cash grab than in creating a meaningful experience. The performances were lackluster at best, and I couldn't help but feel sorry for the talented actors who were dragged into this mess.\n\nThe special effects were downright laughable, as if they were pulled straight from a 90s B-movie. It's as if the production team didn't even bother to do their research or invest in modern technology.\n\nWhat truly irks me is the disrespect shown to the audience. It's almost insulting how the filmmakers seemingly believed that they could slap together any random scenes and call it a movie. As a viewer, I deserve better than this lazy attempt at entertainment. It's disheartening to see creators take such a half-hearted approach to their craft, especially when there are countless talented individuals out there who would kill for the opportunity to bring their visions to life.\n\nIn the end, this movie serves as a reminder of the importance of genuine dedication and respect for the art of filmmaking. The makers of this film should indeed feel ashamed of their work, not only for wasting their own potential but for letting down anyone who had the misfortune of watching their creation. It's a true shame that this film will be forever associated with a missed opportunity to create something truly remarkable.\n\nHuge disappointment."

As mention in the Ramayan & history, Sita was a daughter of Janak and Janak was the king of Mithila Kingdom which is situated in Nepal and people worship Dita as the daughter of Nepal. You can search the history about Janak, Sita & Janakpur dham in google as well. Thousands of Indian & Hindu visit Janakpur yearly to worship them.

Do you feel happy when kids of next generation think Ramayan is just about normal human beings of past who pose with modern hair cut and language of current times does it. It alter history ?

Emotionless and action skills MIA, he left me wondering if he accidentally wandered onto the set from a nearby park bench!\n\nAnd let's talk about Kirti Sanon as Sita - or should I say, a cardboard cutout with less emotion? I've seen more convincing performances from my pet rock. As for Raavan, someone must have hit the resize button, because he looked like he had a growth spurt and ended up in a cartoonish nightmare.\n\nNow, Hanuman - usually the symbol of strength and seriousness - was transformed into a punchline. I was half expecting him to pull out a whoopee cushion during the battle scenes!\n\nThe only thing this movie confirmed was that my decision to watch it was a colossal waste of time. I mean, even my cat could have made a better animated film using a smartphone app. \"Adipurush\" might as well be called \"Adi-poorly-executed.\" Save your precious hours, folks, and steer clear of this animated facepalm disaster!"

Simply speaking in Shudh Hindi and dressing traditionally does not make it an accurate representation of Ramayana, Shri Rama's tale, or even broadly, the premise of Sanatana Dharma. The special effects are awful, truly awful. It truly makes it feel like you're watching a low-budget film, rather than being immersed in the actual story, because it's so off-putting. Unlike movies like Interstellar, where the choreography and special effects make you immersed until you get goosebumps, this was a complete failure. Stay away from the movie, please.

Each musical number was meticulously crafted, showcasing the immense talent of the cast and crew. The catchy melodies and poignant lyrics resonated deeply with the audience, effortlessly drawing us into the story.

Every performance was an impeccable display of talent and dedication. The actors brought their characters to life with such authenticity that it was hard to believe they were not real. Their emotional range was remarkable, capturing the highs and lows of the human experience with such rawness and vulnerability. It was evident that the actors had immersed themselves fully in their roles, delivering performances that were both captivating and relatable. Their chemistry on screen was palpable, creating believable relationships and adding an extra layer of depth to the story.\n\nMoreover, the film's visual aesthetics were stunning.

The use of colors, lighting, and camera angles enhanced the storytelling, evoking specific moods and atmospheres. From sweeping panoramic shots to intimate close-ups, each shot was meticulously crafted to draw us further into the world of the film.\n\nIn addition to the technical aspects, the film also had a compelling and well-crafted storyline.

It seamlessly weaved together themes of love, loss, and personal growth, offering a profound exploration of the human experience. The characters were multi-dimensional and underwent significant transformations, allowing us to empathize with their journeys and learn valuable lessons along the way.\n\nWatching this film was truly an unforgettable experience.

But when it comes to our religion they ignore everything thing are they doing it intensely to hurt us?\n\nDoglapan kab khtm hoga Inka. Neither acting is good not story is as it is and dialogue like a drunk man wrote the dialogue while drinking cheap quality daru.\n\nWe should file maximum case against entire team of this movie so no one in future dares to make fun of our religion."

        "review_detailed_main": "Movie is not a movie it is a total insult of lord ram and acharya lankesh ravana. Ravan is a god is some regions in india. He is a brahman how he can even touch meat. And he is a king what do you think he used to make sward. And now when we come to lord hanuman he is a most ideal god who tells us how to be a devote. In this movie director and dialogue writer used such a cheap slang like lord hanuman is belong a society of mumbai called chaul. In short the imagination was worst, the cinematography was worst, the dialog are very poor and also not according to situations. Some characters who are very necessary in the ramayana is missing. The are showing that lord ram is angry in every scene but anyone even con't think that lord ram can be angry. After all he is maryada purshottam. We all have heard about lanka is made by gold and in the movie we feel like lanka was made by coal. And the dressing and hearing sense of every character looks like they are belongs to kaliyug. Some sceans are copyied by another movies.like the lanka looks exactly look like asgard city from thor ragnarok. And the last fight scene is copied form avangers 2012 . So in the last i would like to say that if anyone like to watch this movie in theaters don't think about it . You can watch ramayana tv show made by mr. Ramanand sagar so that you can know what true ramayan is."

The character look for Ravan is well in line with known information like tall height, devotee of shiva are well portrayed. It is worth to take the kids for this epic drama."

        "review_detailed_main": "Title: Adipurush: A Magnificent Epic That Transcends Boundaries\n\nMy rating :10/10\n\nAdipurush, the highly anticipated Indian epic fantasy film directed by Om Raut, is a visual extravaganza that brings the ancient tale of the Ramayana to life on the big screen. With its grand scale, breathtaking visuals, and powerful performances, Adipurush succeeds in capturing the essence of the timeless mythological narrative.\n\nThe film revolves around the legendary characters of Lord Rama and the demon king Ravana, played brilliantly by Prabhas and Saif Ali Khan, respectively. Prabhas delivers a captivating performance as Lord Rama, exuding grace, valor, and righteousness. His portrayal is both stoic and emotive, allowing audiences to connect with his character on a deeper level. Saif Ali Khan, on the other hand, brings a charismatic and menacing presence to the role of Ravana, showcasing his versatility as an actor.\n\nOne of the standout aspects of Adipurush is its awe-inspiring visual effects. The movie boasts stunning cinematography and meticulous attention to detail in every frame. The larger-than-life sets, breathtaking landscapes, and intricate costumes transport viewers to a mythical world filled with gods, demons, and epic battles. The action sequences are choreographed with finesse, and the use of CGI is seamless, enhancing the overall cinematic experience.\n\nOm Raut's direction is commendable, as he skillfully balances the grandeur of the story with intimate character moments. He manages to present the conflict between good and evil with depth and nuance, allowing for a multi-dimensional exploration of the characters' motivations and dilemmas. The screenplay, written by Prakash Kapadia, masterfully adapts the Ramayana into a contemporary narrative that resonates with audiences of all backgrounds.\n\nThe supporting cast, including Kriti Sanon as Sita and Sunny Singh as Lakshmana, deliver commendable performances, adding depth to the story and complementing the lead actors effectively. Their chemistry and camaraderie contribute to the emotional core of the film.\n\nWhile Adipurush is an enthralling cinematic experience, there are a few minor flaws that prevent it from achieving perfection. At times, the pacing feels slightly uneven, with certain scenes dragging on longer than necessary. Additionally, some character arcs could have been further developed to provide a more well-rounded narrative.\n\nDespite these minor shortcomings, Adipurush is an extraordinary achievement in Indian cinema. It is a testament to the immense talent and dedication of the cast and crew involved. The film's powerful storytelling, breathtaking visuals, and stellar performances make it a must-watch for fans of epic fantasies and lovers of mythological tales.\n\nOverall, Adipurush transports the audience into a mythical realm, where gods and demons clash in a battle that transcends time. It is a cinematic spectacle that celebrates the age-old tale of good versus evil while leaving a lasting impact on the viewer."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have started to watch this movie that this is not Ramayana. Just as a cartoon movie but unfortunately in background they won't forget you that. This is somehow copied the story from Ramayan.\n\nI even couldn't not digest the movie and left in between. It is worst than my imagination.\n\nThey have changed the storyline as per their convenience. I was thinking in the last , will the battle won by Ravan.\n\nAll the dialogue is very bad. Don't know who wrote these. Even they haven't heard the story of Ramayan.\n\nI would recommend to watch Siya ke Ram or Ramanan Sagar 's Ramayana. If you really want to know the story.\n\nMakers should also watch those Serials.\n\nPlease don't play with our Epics."

Such a mockery of deep rooted Hindu culture and mythology. It's an effort worth punishing. Horrendous attempt. Never thought I could see Ramayan being transformed into such a bad version. This is the worst of everything. From cast, screenplay, misrepresentation, oh! Can't miss the worst CGI ever! You'll find it all in this movie. I wish I could get back 3 hours of my life back. What a Royal waste of time this movie was. I'm sure the intention was to copy all Hollywood movies, mix it with the epic Hindu mythological story and they thought they have a formula of a hit machine. 700 crores and they couldn't make a decent movie!"

I pity the people who watched this in cinema.\n\nWhat I didn't like is that men move in slowmotion. There isn't really happening anything. So I fastforwarded it a bit. Then there were a bunch of dementors of the Harry Potter movies and even Skeletor came by. Maybe because Netflix' Grey Skull ain't happening anymore, Skeletor still needed a movie to play in.\n\nEven though I was curious to know what more funny / stupid stuff would happen, I also knew it would be a waste of my time, so I shut it off to write my review about the first ten minutes of the movie."

        "review_title": "A lazy version of Ramayana critiqued by a Hindu (closet athiest)",
        "review_detailed_main": "I am a Hindu who grew up in India. Most people know about Ramayana thanks to an epic serial made in late 80s by Ramanand Sagar. Additionally, Ramayana is part of lots of people growing up in North India thanks to Ramleela. Ramleela is street theater that takes place a week before Dusherra (20 days before diwali) on street corners everywhere in North India. Ramleela depicts the story of Ramayana and each production takes their take depending on their budget and talent. I say this because I don't have any problem with producer Om Raut making their own artistic version. My problem is that his version is a lazy version where artistic liberties are taken and replaced with heavy dose of plagiarism or plain thoughtlessness.\n\nLet's start with dialogues. In the guise of being modern and relevant we have some really thoughtless words uttered by characters who would never speak in that manner.\n\nEditing and pacing of movie is slow and almost makes you go to sleep. There are just way too many slow motion shots and there is absolutely nothing natural about what you see.\n\nCGI is used extensively in this movie but unfortunately it is of very poor quality. You feel like you are watching and animation movie at all times.\n\nLot of side characters are just lifted from western movies. Vanar Sena (Monkey army) looks like is lifted directly from planet of Apes. Ravana is desired to be shown bigger than others and that makes him looks he is floating and look they are trying to copy Thanos with a buzz cut. Asuras in lanka looks to be lifted directly from Orcs in Lord of the rings. Lanka is a direct copy of Asgard from Thor. Ravana looks to be riding the dragon from Game of Thrones.\n\nThoughfulness and artistry is lacking and it instead is replaced by borrowed CGI and whole lot of nothing. Even though I am not religious it looks this was a huge waste of money and opportunity."

        "review_title": "I'm SHOCKED!!!",
        "review_detailed_main": "How could someone be so wrong about Ramayan??? I'm just shocked and kinda angry. I mean why did Om Raut make such a blunder out of a very basic story. I wish I could give it -10. It is absolutely pathetic how they ruined an epic just like it's no big deal. Serious lack of conviction is aptly visible in this doomed project.\n\nI couldn't believe why they would release such kind of a product. If the young minds of today get their understanding of Valmiki Ramayana from this movie then I don't know what will happen in near future.\n\nIf this will be their Raavan then i don't know what exactly will they think of Ramayana in the first place. Absolutely lack luster VFX isn't the only problem with this film. Rather VFX is much less of a problem in this movie. The main flaw is in this representation that has been made by the makers. Raavan has an attire of an islamic dictator. He has been shown wearing a t-shirt along with leather straps over him with a spiky hairstyle and rather non-sense get up. He is shown riding a bat but there is no mention of why he is riding a bat, is that pushpak vimaan or what. Characters around him are just goofy men or rather cartoons in his army who behave like lord of the rings character. Indrajit is shown as a guy having powers of Flash and attire of Connor McGregor. I can't imagine this being Ramayana.\n\nThe first point of Introduction of Rama is pathetic. Shree Ram is shown as fighting some random CGI demons. Who are they? Why are they attacking Sita? Nothing is told as if it's a cartoon film. Even with such a story like that of Ramayana, Raavana's motivations are so childish and vague that we still don't know what he wants. We are shown a scene worth of 2 mins where Ravana's sister gets her nose cut by Laxman's arrow. That scene is so childish. Every detail about Rama's vanvaas is shown to us in a 3 minutes introduction. The movie doesn't want you to connect with any character. The most connected I was to a character was Jatayu which was just for a 3 minutes CGI sequence. Still I was more connected to it than Sita maa, Shree Ram or any one else.\n\nEven walking Saif Ali khan is shown to us with CGI. As if his head is floating on a computer generated body leave alone the 10 head animation. Shree Ram's character is shown very much like a robot which is programmed to react in a certain way. I refuse to even think of this movie as Ramayana and any of the characters as the one in Ramayana.\n\nIn the end Ravan is killed by Rama but how did Rama know about shooting an arrow in his belly? Why didn't Ravan confronted Rama after this? A whole CGI climax of 30 minutes in a movie of 3 hours where the main essence of the story is skipped which doesn't allow you to connect with any character properly is the fundamental wrong with this film.\n\nDialogues are pathetic. They are using slang language in their conversations. At one point they talk in Shudhh Hindi at other point they just start talking in slangs. Hanuman ji uses phrases like \"jalegi tere baap ki\", \"Lanka laga denge\" and is being told that \"ye teri bua ka bageecha hai ki tu tehelne aa gaya\". These dialogues are just the tip of the iceberg. A dialogue by Indrajit goes as \"mere ek sapola ne tere shesh naag ko lamba kardiya\". Now if you don't think this was intentional then I don't know what shows their intention.\n\nOverall this movie is an unbearable garbage which no devotee of Shree Rama or any person in general deserves to witness and at least not by spending money. Don't watch it."
