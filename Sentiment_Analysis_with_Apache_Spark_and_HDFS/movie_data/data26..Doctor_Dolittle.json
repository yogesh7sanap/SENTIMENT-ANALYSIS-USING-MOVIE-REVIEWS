        "review_detailed_main": "Doctor Dolittle (1998)\n\nI was surprised to see this movie got such a low rating\u2014it's not so bad. Oh, for sure it's not so great, either. But Eddie Murphy alone makes it something worth watching (he's one of the few perfect-pitch comedians out there). And the story, a 1920 classic for children, is something of its own.\n\nWhat falls apart is the slightly pushy sentimentalism and the generally mediocre secondary cast. That might be enough to push it into mediocrity, for sure, but it's not meant to be a deep classic, and it plays with the story nicely.\n\nThat story is not just about a doctor (of the human type) who can hear animals talking. It's more about how society condemns hims and tries to help him with psycho-care. His bland wife (with the gorgeous eyes that get overplayed) is typical of his \"friends,\" all nice people with distractions and no time for the possibility that he might, in fact, hear animals talk.\n\nThe talking animals are of course great fun, from the rats to the tiger. This is the part of the movie that is meant to appeal across the board, and it does, including its good special effects. The feeling of family, not dysfunctional, is another bit of warmth, not to mention that the family is African American, a nice twist on the original story based on an English doctor.\n\nAnd though the movie was not liked by critics, it has made a third of a billion dollars, which speaks for itself. Not a masterpiece, and not even a classic, it still has wonderful aspects including a very wonderful basic concept."

This film is basically a remake, minus the songs, and while it isn't brilliant and no masterpiece in any shape or form, it does have its good things. The film's plot is very slight, and the script has its weak spots while having some funny ones as well. And there is sometimes uneven pacing and direction. But it is nicely filmed, and the music is nice enough. The acting was also pretty good. Eddie Murphy does a serviceable job as John Dolittle, his role is not really like the ones he had in Beverly Hills Cop or Trading Places which also happens to two of his better movies, but he does well, and I will say he has been worse and he's been in worse films too. Kyla Pratt looks lovely and acts nicely as Maya, and Ossie Davis is good as well. The voice cast carry the picture as the animals who (along with the above average effects) steal the show. Consisting of the likes of Garry Shandling, John Leguizamo and Gilbert Gottfried they do great jobs, however Oliver Platt and Peter Boyle have little to do. Overall, a nice watch but nothing exceptional. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

It would be better to have a buddy comedy with the dog. Eddie Murphy has good chemistry with him. The other outstanding voicework is Chris Rock who does the gerbil Rodney.\n\nIt's a generally a nice family movie with some crude humor. It works on that level. Just don't expect more. The potty humor may offend the parents, but there isn't anything to be concerned about."

        "review_detailed_main": "`Doctor Dolittle'. ***. (1998, USA, PG-13, 85 min. Directed by Betty Thomas with Edie Murphy, Ossie Davis, Oliver Platt, Richard Schiff, Kristen Wilson, Kyla Pratt). John Dolittle (Murphy) can talk to the animals and they can talk to him. At least he/they could when he was a kid. His dad thought he was nuts and though the use of an exorcist and some stern fatherly persuasion John looses or suppresses his talent/curse. When we next see John, he is Dr. Dolittle, M.D, happily married, father of two girls. He's a respected partner in a very successful medical practice and is about to become very rich. He and his partners are about to sell to an HMO. Everything seems to be going great until Dr. Dolittle almost gets into a car accident with a dog. A bump on his head brings back the voices. Is he going nuts, are life's stresses too much, or does Dr. John just need to find his inner child?\n\nThe rest is a rather silly man-gets-in-touch-with-soul type movie, except for the animals. They have all the good lines. There's the lascivious German shepherd that can't control himself even when he's pleading his reformation on the way to being clipped. The pigeon couple; she's a nag, he's a wimp. There are the quarreling rats, the neurotic terrier, the tiger, and of course Lucky, the dog Dr. Dolittle hit in the car accident. To his credit Murphy let's the animals have their say while he plays straight man to their lines. One other thing about Murphy's acting; Dr. Dolittle is not the least bit comfortable around animals. When Dr. Dolittle has to catch daughter Maya's (Pratt) guinea pig, he holds it in a folded pillow so he doesn't have to touch it. (Having similar feelings about pets, I was amused by Dr. Dolittle's behavior around animals.) What's funny about this is, apparently Murphy wasn't acting. But this all added up to a fun movie. I recommend it."

        "review_detailed_main": "This version of \"Doctor Dolittle\" came into stores back when I was twelve years old, which was when I first saw it. I think I liked it a lot at the time, and watched it again a few months later. After many years, I just decided to check it out again. Since I'm obviously not as easily amused as I was when I was twelve, and was aware that it generally wasn't considered that great, I didn't have very high expectations. Afterwards, however, I certainly can't say that I think it's as bad as some do.\n\nDuring his childhood, John Dolittle talks to animals. It seems that he can understand them, and they can understand him, but when his dad sees this, he thinks it's ridiculous. After John's dog is taken away, he is obviously not happy, and stops talking to animals for a long time. When he grows up, he becomes a physician, and has a wife and two daughters. It seems that Dr. Dolittle's communication with animals is long gone, but one night, after he nearly runs over a dog on the road, he hears it say something! Now, his childhood ability has come back, and soon, he finds many different types of creatures following him around! How will people be able to believe that he actually has this remarkable gift, and that it's not just a mental illness, as one would probably assume?!\n\nAs you would probably expect, this movie has its fair share of lame jokes (such as a rat farting), and like you've probably already heard, the movie would overall appeal more to kids than anyone else. However, certainly not all of the gags are lame. During my most recent viewing, I wouldn't have been surprised if I had kept a straight face through the entire thing, but that's not what happened. I found no huge laughs in the film, but there were several times when I smiled and snickered. I also found that the story gets suspenseful to some degree towards the end. Eddie Murphy's performance is also a highlight. Some of the voice-overs for the animals are silly, maybe the majority of them, but this isn't much of a problem.\n\nFor kids, this movie could be very funny, though it is somewhat crude at times, remember the PG-13 rating. So, I don't know how appropriate for kids it is (that's for parents to decide). For adults, and probably adolescents, this version of \"Doctor Dolittle\" is certainly nothing special. It could be mildly amusing, if you don't mind extreme silliness and crude toilet humour, but there's probably also a fair chance that you would find it absolutely revolting (I think some clearly have). Without a doubt, this movie is pretty cheesy, and skipping it wouldn't be a great loss for most people, but it's certainly not one that I advise everyone to avoid at all costs (though that would probably be a good idea for some people)."

Here Murphy is reduced to reacting lamely and is upstaged throughout by the wisecracking critters. While fellow humans Dr Weller (Oliver Platt) and Calloway (Peter Boyle) are shallow villians to prop up a shaky story involving the corporate takeover of Dolittle's vet clinic. He doesn't just talk to the animals!.For thousands of year animals have been trying to tell us something, but their cries have fallen on deaf ears...until they found John Dolittle !. This Summer...The Doctor is In Learn to talk in 500 animal languages from a parrot who speaks 1000!.The most joyous entertainment for the whole family! You've never seen anything like it in your life!.\n\nAn enjoyable adventure about a botcher doctor, regaining his wit and courage as he makes friends, crosses adversaries and encounters wondrous creatures created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. The marvelous and agreeable premise suffers, at times, from a poor and weak script. Children will find this flick very amusing thanks to Eddie Murphy 's stunning acting, a lot of beloved animals, colorful cinematography and sympathetic script. May pack a bit too much bathroom for some family tastes. Gastrointestinal, flatulence and other bodily functions dominate the humor and subplots involving Dolittle's daughter nearly undoes te charm, but it's a passable entertainment. No animals were harmed during the making of this film, but there was probably cruel and unusual treatment of the interns involving pooper-scoopers. Murphy's well accompanied by the always likeable Kyla Pratt who stars the sequels, Ossie Davis, Oliver Platt, Peter Boyle, Richard Schiff, Kristen Wilson, Jeffrey Tambor, Raven-Symon\u00e9 , among others . Traditional values and great movie for families, resulting to be an exciting movie from beginning to end, this is an amazing feel nice film and I was hoping to see more like it. Direction by Betty Thomas(28 days , Troop Beverly Hills , Dr Dolittle , Alvin and the chipmunks the squeaksequel, I spy), is ordinary, fitting to comedy film. Rating 5/10 . Average but amusing.\n\nOther versions about Hugh Lofting's acclaimed tales were starred by Eddie Murphy, made in 1998 , 2001 and 2006, such as : \u00a8Dr Dolittle 2\u00a8 by Steve Carr , the good doctor goes back, persuaded to save the forest from human developers. And \u00a8Dr Dolittle 3\u00a8 with Kyla Pratt, Kristen Wilson, Walker Howard, John Amos. \u00a8Dr. Dolittle 4: Tail to the Chief\u00a8 (2008) by Craig Shapiro with Kyla Pratt, Peter Coyote, Malcolm Stewart, Niall Matter. And recent \u00a8Dolittle\u00a8 (2020) by Stephen Gaghan with Robert Downey, Antonio Banderas, Michael Sheen , Jim Broadbent, Jessie Buckley, Emma Thompson , Rami Malek. And the 1967 classic \u00a8Doctor Dolittle\u00a8 by Richard Fleischer with Rex Harrison, Anthony Newley, Samantha Eggar, Peter Bull , Muriel Landers, Portia Nelson, William Dix and Richard Attemborough. Wholeheartedly recommend for a great family movie. Fun enough and great adventure for kids and adults. Doctor Dolittle is one of the most joyous entertainment for the whole family."

That fact that it's rated PG-13 ought to tell you something.\n\nComedy is about the only genre of film making that I think has gone way downhill since the classic era.

This is a famous kids story and I'm sure many parents took their children to see this film....and were totally embarrassed. If it was advertised as an adult movie: fine, I would have no problems with it. But that's not the case, and so it's a disgusting sham, typical of low-life Hollywood.\n\nIn addition to the onslaught of language (which includes Jesus's name in vain three times among the other offenses) and fecal matter/fart jokes, the film basically wasn't that funny to begin with It's also not a shock, either, when you discover that Betty Thomas directed this film.

Check them out.\n\nAll in all, this is fun, if only mildly so, and totally silly. The kids will love it.\n\nIt rates a 5.8/10 from...\n\nthe Fiend :."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've always thought Eddie Murphy did comedy better than action, but now I have to add honesty and integrity to his repetoire. He does such a wonderful family film here that it's almost hard to believe he got his start on Saturday Night Live. The mere concept of talking with the animals is created quite believably in the film even though you have to consider the detail that would go into such a feat actually existing. Considering the sheer diversity of the animal kingdom and the limited scope of animals to rationalize, Murphy as Dolittle would have to have considerable telepathic and clairvoyant prowess as well the data-crunching power of a computer in order to decipher instantly the motivations and inclinations of two to three animals at one time as well as come up with the human equivalent of the animal's personality. The concept of animals conversing inter-species wise would have to involve some sort of Mother Earth Theory that all animals wild and domesticated are linked by a central innate consciousness. That said, this movie is quite enjoyable despite the theories and examination it entails. Actress Kristen Wilson as Murphy's wife is a very lovely presence to the movie and former child actress Raven-Symone is becoming a lovely young actress herself far removed from that annoyingly unbearable kid she played on The Cosby Show. The rest of the cast are second stringers to the animal cast whose voices are brought to life by the vocal talents of Norm MacDonald, Julie Kavner, John Leguizamo, Garry Shandling, Jenna Elfman, Gilbert Gottfried and sounding eerily like James Belushi, Albert Brooks. This is one wonderful movie that belongs in your video collection at home."

I actually liked the mice better in the second one. Eddie Murphy was good in it, not his best but was definitely worth starrring in it. I don't think anyone could've played his part any better than he could, well maybe Bill Murray could've been a Dr. Doliitle but I already liked those characters. The old sister that's in That's So Raven is very pretty. A good film to look at.\n\n7/10"

This shows why we're running out of special ideas in making a quality movie, ladies and gentlemen! It has some signs of hope for its likeable and delightful imagery of animals who can act and speak with humans. Things can only get more worse, unfortunately. Bathroom jokes and sexual references kill this piece of \"family\" funfare instantly. Even parents and children saw the trailer ad on The Family Channel, which was followed by utter angst and disgust in the movie theater. Sad to say this is the more progressive pre-millennium era, but enjoy it while it lasts 'cause things can only get worse with time. More went wrong with the all-new DR. DOLITTLE. It is absolutely plotless, feeling too flat. I also hate that irritating voice of Chris Rock!!! We need more talented voice-overs than a bunch of overpaid celebs who don't want to declare bankruptcy. I'll have to agree on my local newspaper giving this among the top five worst movies of 1998. Then again, the original version wasn't any good, either. Murphy's next project could be PATTON if he's not careful!"

        "review_detailed_main": "You can probably tell by the gap between release and review that I wasn't that bothered about seeing this. But seeing as I haven't watched anything for ages, I figured that a little light relief might not be such a bad thing. And like most of Eddie Murphy's back catalogue, \"light relief\" is exactly what was on the menu. While maybe not a patch on the original, it is a great family film that has plenty for kids of all ages to enjoy even if it does have its flaws.\n\nMurphy plays work-committed doctor John Dolittle, working in an inner-city practise and occasionally finding the time to spend with his wife (Kristen Wilson) and two daughters (Raven-Symon\u00e9 and Kyla Pratt). But after nearly running a dog over, he is shocked to recall his forgotten childhood ability to talk and communicate with animals. And as word spreads around the animal kingdom, Dolittle struggles with his sanity as every cat, rat and horse in the area flock to him for medical advice. He also struggles to persuade his family and colleagues about his claims, just as his practise is about to merge in a big-money deal.\n\nMurphy, by now in the middle of the end of his career, doesn't need to try too hard but actually, he is surprisingly good as the increasingly demented doctor. Maybe because he doesn't have to slap on several thousand dollars worth of latex or play every character in the movie but \"Doctor Dolittle\" serves as a reminder that he can be an accomplished performer without going completely over the top like he does nowadays. However, Murphy is no match for the variety of animals acting alongside him and even though the animals actually talk through clever and discreet CG, the numerous voices and guest stars (Chris Rock, Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks, Julie \"Marge Simpson\" Kavner and more) have all the best lines and make the movie genuinely entertaining. The humour is suitable for a family film - great for kids, mildly amusing for grown-ups - but it does take a while to get going and for some reason, the ending didn't feel particularly satisfying.\n\nWhat it lacks in songs, dance routines and Rex Harrision, it makes up for in characterisation and humour. \"Doctor Dolittle\" might not change the world but it is perfect family fare to slap on a slow Sunday afternoon when the weather prevents play outside and you're fed up of hearing them on their Playstations. The only problems I can think of is that it lacks the charm of the original, it could have made more of the premise and the whole thing isn't especially memorable, Murphy's performance aside. But at least he isn't anything like as annoying as he is these days and just like Steve Martin in \"Father Of The Bride\", this film acts almost as a tribute to a former comedian and actor before they decide to ruin their career with some shocking films. So if you're still recovering from the likes of \"Pluto Nash\" or \"Norbitt\" then I advise you to watch this because if anything else, this is an Eddie Murphy film that doesn't make you want to blow up Hollywood."

He is so talented that offers of financial backing for he and his partners are coming in from unexpected sources. This is great news for John, his lovely wife and their two sweet daughters. However, when John was a boy, he could talk, truly, to his pet dog and spent time having long conversations with the canine. This made his father (Ossie Davis) so worried that he summoned the preacher to their house. There, the minister tried to call \"the devil\" out of John's body, an exercise that caused John's beloved dog to bite the holy man. When his father gave away the dog, John was heartbroken. No longer would he talk with animals. Yet, on a rainy night, Dr. John nearly hits a dog and brakes quickly, causing him to bump his head. Suddenly, John can hear what the animals around him are saying, much to his initial dismay. From rats to owls to tigers, animals are coming to ask for his help. With so much distraction, can he concentrate on his human medical treatments? This is a very nice family film, especially for those who adore animals. Murphy is great as the doctor and the rest of the cast is also nice, with Davis a pleasure to see and hear. Watch out, too, for Paul Giammati as the shrink summoned to examine John's mental health! The sets, costumes, and production are first rate. But, it is the lovable animals, and their human voices, that are the big stars. From the cute guinea pig to the lovable dog to the tipsy monkey, these critters are out to capture the hearts of the viewers. And, they succeed very, very well."

It tells the story of John Dolittle, a doctor who has been talking to animals since he was a child. But thanks to his parents' efforts, he has forgotten this gift as he grows up ... until suddenly, for no apparent reason, he begins to hear animals talk and is on the verge of a nervous breakdown over it.\n\nSound improbable? In fact, it is ... if I had such a gift, I certainly would not suddenly discover it after years and years without using it. The movie does not explain how Dolittle managed to go years without hearing animals and suddenly begin to hear them so clearly. It is a sudden and unbelievable change. However, the whole plot of the movie is weak. There is truly no story to tell ... what we have here is a basic script skeleton that only serves as the basis for a succession of jokes presented to us by Eddie Murphy and all the animals with whom he plays. The humor is based on dialogues, speech and situations involving animals, to the point that they become the real protagonists and Murphy loses relevance in the film. But trying to see this movie from the logical side means taking all the fun out of it. In fact, we enjoy the movie better if we tolerate the faults of the poor and poor script and simply get carried away by what we are seeing and enjoying the jokes.\n\nEddie Murphy, with this movie and others that followed, probably lived his golden age as an actor. He got money, fame, popularity, good deals ... but in fact he never shows value as an actor. Not because he doesn't have it - he showed it in other movies - but because he had so little to do in this movie! Murphy does little while he is Dolittle (curious!). Of the rest of the cast it is better not to speak. The voice actors (notably Norm MacDonald and Chris Rock) shone more brightly than the entire human cast.\n\nTechnically, the movie is quite regular. Not excellent and having very poor visual and sound effects. The soundtrack is virtually non-existent and even the opening and ending themes are uninteresting."

And the lip-sync'ing makes the old Godzilla films look brilliantly done by comparison. Meanwhile, Eddie \"Pluto Nash\" Murphy drones on with a suppressed understated delivery that is painful to experience. Apparently, he's trying to modify his old manic persona, but to what? In short, all the magic and wonder of the 1967 original version is lost in this re-imagining, or whatever it is. A town wants to bully some forest creatures and blame them for doing bad stuff. No, really. And Pluto Nash can psycho-babble with them. Things chain along with some stale jokes to a dull uninspired conclusion with no surprises.\n\nRent the '67 movie.

I don't think of it as a children's movie though, cause a lot of the humour really passes them by. Too much irony, I presume. (Kids are not very good at that) But they'll still love it. After all, there are a bunch of cute animals in it!\n\nAll in all, I have no problem recommending it to others, it's definitely worth seeing, and it provides more than enough laughs for the bucks. I saw it three times, YOU should at least see it once."

When a master actor like Murphy is enjoying himself it is night and day.\n\nThe story is modernized and adapted beautifully. The story itself is well written and heart warming. That said, the movie leans into adult topics a lot more than you would think, at least more than I would expect the conservative Disney of today.\n\nThere are a slew of supporting voice actors, to include Norm MacDonald, that all work very well into their roles. The multi-threaded plots work well together, and Eddie Murphy slowing thinking he's gone insane is a lot fun."

One of my favourite scenes in comedy is in 'Fierce Creatures' starring John Cleese when Rollo Lee (John Cleese) tries his best to cope with the animals in the park yet at the same time attempting to keep a decorum. Such a formula could have been used in Dr Dolittle film to great effect.\n\nDirected by Betty Thomas, this film depicts a man who can talk to animals but not in the light seen in British - theatre. Whichever is best I dare not say but nevertheless this is a good, light film which is guaranteed to get laughs out of children and maybe even adults too."

        "review_detailed_main": "An entertaining endeavor, Dr. Dolittle is thankfully more good than bad, but does prove to be quite uneven at times. My biggest critique of this film is its tone. It often feels formulaic for sure, but what hurts most I feel is its almost lifeless atmosphere. If written not so forcibly a comedy, like it obviously should be, this film would honestly feel like a horror movie of Murphy's character going plain mad. There are also a handful of things that simply did not age well, and a stir of annoying repetitive dialogue that can just get in the way of the fun in this movie- obviously done to drag out the films short runtime. Yeah it's quite flawed, and messy, but it's inescapably fun to watch. Honestly this film just goes to show you it should be easy to have fun talking animals on screen, which makes it interesting how so many people in recent years continue to fail again and again. Murphy isn't anything special, but he also isn't over the top which is a nice breath of fresh air after just watching his painful performance in Imagine That. The voice cast is fun, even if they can be overdone at times, and I honestly always enjoyed hearing Norm MacDonald and Chris Rock on screen. The film can also be pretty heartfelt at times without it ever feeling corny or sentimental. It feels genuine and allows us to invest in the animal characters even despite their flaws. In the end, Dr. Dolittle is far from a perfect family film- and did eventually lead to spawn countless other Murphy family centered flops- but ultimately it's a fine and enjoyable film even despite its several issues.\n\nMy Rating: 5.9/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "A modern and rather loose take on the classic children's story, the Dr. Dolittle movie from 1998 sees Eddie Murphy's doctor slowly realize that either he can actually talk to animals or he is losing his mind entirely.\n\nThe film opens with a young John Dolittle discovering his talents before he is encouraged by his father to forget about all that, which he does well into adulthood. Now a successful doctor and surgeon in San Francisco, John is about to join his family on vacation when he bumps his head almost running over a dog and his abilities promptly return. Not knowing what to make of that, he struggles to come to terms with it all and panics trying to hide his secret from others until he can't. Meanwhile, John's colleagues are trying to set up a meeting with the owner of a medical company who has shown interest in purchasing John's practice. When a tiger from a circus shows signs of a possible neurological issue, John has to decide whether to step in and save its life, others be damned, or try to live a normal life.\n\nThere's not much more to this light-hearted comedy story-wise and, in fact, the tiger plot only really becomes relevant right at the end, with two thirds of the film dedicated to John Dolittle freaking out about his animal chats. Dr. Dolittle was a box-office hit, hot off the success of The Nutty Professor a couple of years earlier, and Eddie Murphy proved once again that he could single-handedly elevate material that, in lesser hands, might not have worked well at all. Unfortunately, Dr. Dolittle lacks the laughs that The Nutty Professor delivered and feels very slight in comparison. The animals, who are sometimes CG'ed, sometimes puppets, and voiced by the likes of Chris Rock, Norm MacDonald and Albert Brooks, get the bulk of the lines here but they're rarely funny.\n\nThe writing is the main problem with this movie which, not only lacks genuine laughs but fails to give Eddie Murphy anything to work with, though he definitely does his best to keep things entertaining at least. Not to mention that John Dolittle doesn't so much go on an adventure as he does whine and complain for an hour about what is obviously a very cool power to have. This routine gets tiresome fast and, even though the supporting cast is solid (Oliver Platt, Peter Boyle, Jeffrey Tambor, Paul Giamatti), they're only really there to fill time until the inevitable animal fart joke and keep the non-kids who are watching this from giving up on it completely.\n\nThis Dr. Dolittle is harmless enough and younger viewers will be reasonably entertained but this needed a stronger plot, perhaps one focused on the tiger at the circus, and a lot more laughs to make it worth sitting through because, as it stands, this is just not very good.\n\nDisappointing."

Oliver Platt is the actor with the right frame of mind to compliment this also. Richard Schiff is also memorable as are all of the non human actors and actresses.\n\nThis movie works because it knows that its a comedy and plays itself like so instead of trying to twist the source material into something triggering. Unfortunately the opening scene is badly handled, and the film effectively has to restart itself."

It seems that he can understand them, and they can understand him, but when his dad sees this, he thinks it's ridiculous. After John's dog is taken away, he is obviously not happy, and stops talking to animals for a long time. When he grows up, he becomes a physician, and has a wife and two daughters. It seems that Dr. Dolittle's communication with animals is long gone, but one night, after he nearly runs over a dog on the road, he hears it say something! Now, his childhood ability has come back, and soon, he finds many different types of creatures following him around! How will people be able to believe that he actually has this remarkable gift, and that it's not just a mental illness, as one would probably assume?! As you would probably expect, this movie has its fair share of lame jokes (such as a rat farting), and like you've probably already heard, the movie would overall appeal more to kids than anyone else. However, certainly not all of the gags are lame. During my most recent viewing, I wouldn't have been surprised if I had kept a straight face through the entire thing, but that's not what happened. I found no huge laughs in the film, but there were several times when I smiled and snickered. I also found that the story gets suspenseful to some degree towards the end. Eddie Murphy's performance is also a highlight. Some of the voice-overs for the animals are silly, maybe the majority of them, but this isn't much of a problem."

There was no singing in Star Wars. So it will come as no surprise that I wasn't really anticipating this film and was prepared to be bored to tears with a G-rated Eddie Murphy singing to kids. Imagine my surprise to find some witty dialog coming right out of the horse's mouth so to speak. Ahem.\n\nEddie Murphy plays Dr Dolittle a family man who seems a little wrapped in his work as a Doctor. So busy in fact that hasn't the time to stop and listen to the animals that all of a sudden decided that they would like to talk to him. Despite years of being silent. With in days Dolittle ditches the profitable people with Medical insurance in favor of pigeons and guinea pigs. His now talkative four legged and winged companions teach him how to be a better man, husband and father. Naturally a change of lifestyle and a better relationship with his family follows. All we need now is sort of dilemma and action in the 3rd act to seal the deal. Oh wait there it is save one Tiger from certain death. That was close nearly missed it in the moral preaching that saturates this film.\n\nThe Animals are a host of well knowns that steal scene after scene with impersonations and one liners. Apparently animals make up for their lack of civility lack of technology opposable thumbs with a good sense of humor. Chris Rock as the hamster (also G-Rated) is completely wasted here however had my neighbors hamster made this much noise. It wouldn't have been set upon by the vacuum cleaner.\n\nThe film is aimed at the children but there is enough here to keep the adults amused. Dr Dolittle has more that its share of slap stick and the toilet humor that cannot be avoided. Despite this its probably with the price of a rental."

Doctor Dolittle is a must-see for 1998!\n\nJohn Dolittle (Eddie Murphy) had a gift that he could talk to animals when he was younger. When a dog called Lucky calls him 'Bone-head' one day, he remembers that special gift. Now he has a tiger to help, a family to look after, a guinea pig to rock with and an alcoholic monkey to cure.\n\nDoctor Dolittle is great. Look out for the voice of Chris Rock as he hilarious hamster!!\n\nMy rating : 10/10. GREAT FUN!"

It bogs down with a lot of sentimental rubbish as well...I don't know if it is just me, but I want to laugh when I go see a comedy, not have a message jammed down my throat. Though this one is probably good for families, the parents should be warned that they are in for a good joke here or there, but the rest of the time it is a bit stupid. Norm MacDonald is rather good as the voice of the dog and Chris Rock is recognizable as well, as for the rest of the voices who is to say who they are, no other actors with really distinct voices seem to be used. Some of the jokes may be a bit inappropriate for children, but they most likely will go over the child's head. For the most part this movie is a slow mover that just isn't all that funny for most adults. Seems like Eddie though is making a career off of this type of movie so more power to him."

        "review_detailed_main": "What were you thinking? I'll admit the 1998 remake was entertaining, the way \"Wings\" is at one o'clock in the morning when nothing else is on, but, like \"The Nutty Professor\" Murphy's kid-friendly remake looks like a crime against cinema when placed next to its source material. First off, this is a musical with a beautiful score by Leslie Bricusse (who wrote the songs for \"Willy Wonka\" and \"Stop the World, I Want To Get Off\" with longtime partner Anthony Newley, who stars in this film). Also, Rex Harrison WORKED to learn to talk to animals. It wasn't a magical power he was born with, the man studied! He doesn't need cheesy (if well-cast) celebrity voiceovers and computer-generated mouth-movement to convince us, either. So if you want your kids to settle for second best and, as a result, drag you to mediocre kiddy-fair after mediocre kiddy-fair (which, in the age of \"The Cat in the Hat\" is pretty bad) let 'em have Eddie Murphy. But if you want your kids to have taste and appreciate a quality piece of film-making, rent this film immediately. Even if you have no kids, buy it, rent it, whatever."

Whats funny that the tiger was going to jump off the inside building. Whats sad that the tiger has sickness, double vision, and headaches. This story is about a Dr. who takes care of animals. In this part a lot of animals where in Dr. Dolittle. Hamilton Camp has a fantastic voice for the pig. Chris rocks voice of Rodney is Hilarius.

One of the parts was when Lucky (voice of Norm Macdonald) used the toilet and flushed it. There were lots of other parts that made me laugh, too. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that the performances were hilarious, the production design was outstanding, and the costume design was perfect. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Eddie Murphy, I highly recommend this film! You're in for a lot of laughs, or your money back."

It's a fun fantasy set-up for some hilarious scenes with a panicking Murphy & his trying to ignore it all, this is simply a harmless feelgood Comedy than anyone can enjoy, i always loved Eddie Murphy here in his role as the stressed out family man who is coming to terms with his Gift, it's very funny at times & has a genuinely nice & Happy feel to the whole film, it's a friendly feelgood flick that is entertaining & very re-watchable even as an adult!!!\n\nThere's lots of fun Animals & recognisable voices & there's that very 90's look & feel that i love as i grew up in the 90s.\n\nJust because we grow up it doesn't mean we have to leave behind the Happy fantasy worlds we used to visit often.\n\nIn an often dark & scary world it's nice to watch something sweet & fun."

        "review_title": "Very cute modern take",
        "review_detailed_main": "My advice is to start with the Eddie Murphy version of Doctor Dolittle. If you've missed all seven movie versions of the classic books, start with 1998. It's very different than the 1967 classic, and if you start with that one, you don't stand a chance at enjoying the modern version. This one takes place in 1998 San Francisco, rather than 1850s England, and it's not a musical. Nor does Eddie Murphy travel the world in search of a rare pink seasnail. Instead of being a linguist who's mastered over 400 animal languages, all the animals communicate with him in English.\n\nBut it's very, very funny! The premise, though different than the original, is just as interesting. Eddie talked to his dog as a child, but learned to tamp down his talent when his father, Ossie Davis, shamed him. Decades later, with a wife and children of his own, he hears the voice of a dog who he almost crashed into on the road. He realizes his talent has resurfaced, and he struggles with accepting it. He can help animals, and because he's a medical doctor, he can even heal them. Just imagine how wonderful it would be if veterinarians could actually talk to their patients.\n\nA side plot involves the merger of Eddie's medical practice, with business partners Oliver Platt and Richard Schiff, to a larger conglomerate. Also, because Eddie tries to hide his dialogues, when he does occasionally get overheard talking to monkeys or rats, people think he's crazy! It's a very funny take on the original story that can be accessible to modern audiences, and with one added bonus: voice cameos. Tons of celebrities voice the different animals, and with no opening credits, you're left to guess who they are until the very end - it's great fun!\n\nDLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Eddie Murphy drives with the guinea pig in the beginning of the movie, it shows the animal's POV for a few seconds. Also, when Lucky first gets taken into the vet's office, his POV is shown for a few seconds, and it will make you sick. In other words, \"Don't Look, Mom!\""
