They particularly liked the \"toys\" and the personalities of the children. Without spoiling it, the ending was plenty exciting for them. I am glad we took them, regardless of what I thought of the film."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you've been thinking about hiring somebody to clean out those clogged gutters or to get that darned septic tank working again, just call Jon Voight. Yeah, the same Jon Voight who won an Academy Award as best actor in 1978 for \"Coming Home.\" The star of \"Midnight Cowboy,\" \"Catch-22\" and \"Conrack\" -- you know, Angelina Jolie's dad.\n\nWhy bother Mr. Voight? Well, considering that he's lending his name to \"SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses 2,\" he clearly has a lot of time on his hands, doesn't consider any job too demeaning and probably won't charge too much.\n\nIn case you're wondering why Voight would elect to appear in \"SuperBabies,\" the follow-up to a movie he wasn't in, instead of \"Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid\" -- and don't pretend you don't remember the scene in the first \"Anaconda\" in which the gargantuan serpent swallows, then coughs up Voight -- here's a hint: Voight was an executive producer of the original \"Baby Geniuses.\" Since that 1999 fiasco effectively torpedoed what was left of the screen careers of Christopher Lloyd and Kathleen Turner, it must have been a formidable challenge finding actors eager to strip themselves of every scintilla of dignity to perform alongside a bunch of feisty computer-generated toddlers (with the exception of Scott Baio and Vanessa Angel, of course). Apparently for Voight it was put up or shut up time.\n\nSo here he is, ladies and gentlemen, outfitted with not one, but two dollar-store-quality wigs and employing an absurd German accent as Bill Biscane, a megalomaniac who plans to use cheaply made, insipid kiddie TV shows to hypnotize babies around the world and rob them of their free will; clearly, Biscane marches to the sound of his own drummer. But those who cherish the ideal of infants being able to make their own choices need not despair: SuperBaby Kahuna (played by Gerry, Leo and Myles Fitzgerald, who are by no means identical triplets) is on the case, and if there's anybody you want on your side when you're facing an onslaught of wretched programming, it's \"a small fry with a big attitude\" who taunts his enemies with such put-downs as \"Why don't you pick on somebody half your size?\" and \"Never send a man to do a boy's job.\"\n\nKahuna -- who is revealed to be a grown man trapped in the body of a pre-schooler, in a slightly sickening plot twist that requires three flashback scenes to post-World War II Germany to explain -- has some major connections, too. He can jump on his computer network and converse with Whoopi Goldberg, the members of that nearly forgotten boy-band O-Town, or any other celebrity or pseudo-celebrity willing to be pasted into a movie that only an unfortunate few are fated to see. Although he seems wise beyond his years as he notes that \"every child has power -- all you have to do is believe,\" Kahuna lives in what looks like a papier-mache cave full of large plywood and plaster imitation toys that might have been salvaged from the windows of a now-defunct F.A.O. Schwarz location. It's a sad sight indeed.\n\nThere are other four SuperBabies, too, and just prior to the climactic showdown with Biscane and his goons, this diaper-clad quartet jumps onto Kahuna's magic carousel, where they are transformed into Brain Boy (who wears a scaled-down cap and gown), Cupid Girl (who shoots arrows that cause grown men to stop fighting and hug each other instead), Bounce Baby (who is stuck inside an orange beach ball) and Baby Courageous (whose get-up proves that the only thing that looks worse than a grown man in a tacky hairpiece is a toddler in a bad toupee).\n\nWatching from the sidelines are Baio and Angel, as the dizzy owners of a highly questionable day care center in which most of the children parade around half-dressed, and Hilary Duff clone Skyler Shaye and Frankie Muniz lookalike Justin Chatwin, who attempt to provide a bit of squeaky-clean teen love interest -- not exactly what the target audience of 6-year-olds is itching to see.\n\nAs was the case with \"Baby Geniuses,\" the movie contains a surplus of awkward-looking digital effects that are supposed to convince us the wee ones are actually making wisecracks and running wild. The results are generally pitiful. If \"SuperBabies\" is marginally better than the excruciating \"Geniuses\" -- and you sure wouldn't want to live on the difference -- it's because director Bob Clark and screenwriter Gregory Poppen don't shoehorn in nearly as much innuendo or smarminess this time around; they're equally stingy with charm and imagination as well.\n\nBy the way, Voight's next project is called \"The Karate Dog,\" in which he'll co-star with Simon Rex, Pat Morita and Chevy Chase, who'll provide \"the voice of Cho-Cho,\" according to the Internet Movie Database. Do an Oscar winner a big favor and call him this weekend -- really, the guy must be willing to do just about anything for a couple bucks."

Believe me, I've had to sit through some bad kid flix, but this one is an all time loser. There is a woman with very large lips (Vanessa Angel) who almost makes it bearable, just for the pure fascination of watching whether or not they will explode.

        "review_detailed_main": "I was expecting this movie to be bad, and it was even worse than I expected. I have seen some truly terrible movies in my time like Home Alone 4, NeverEnding Story 3 and any of the Friedburg-Seltzer movies. But Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2 brings the phrase \"terrible movie\" to a new level. And believe me, that is being kind about this piece of garbage. I am truly not surprised that it is in the bottom 100, it deserves to be there. That is how bad it is, and it highly deserved the 4 Razzie nominations it received. If you thought the first movie was bad, and it was, this is even worse. Sorry if I sound harsh, but I am trying to be honest.\n\nThe dialogue was absolutely excruciating. I seriously wouldn't be surprised if it was written by a six year old. It completely lacked sophistication and humour. And guess how many times I laughed during this movie? You guessed right, not even once! The plot was lazy, uninspired and clumsy. The idea of a media mogul wanting to dominate the world? How many times has this being done before? Loads, and much better might I add. The direction was sluggish and never reached its focus. Even worse than the dialogue, direction and plot were the fight sequences. How tedious were they? Very, not to mention very inappropriate, even for a family movie.\n\nThe performances from the entire cast were exceedingly poor. Jon Voight has pulled off some good performances in the past. However, I truly think he was held at gunpoint to star in this mess. And he gives the worst performance of his entire career here, acquiring a simply dreadful German accent that has to be among the worst ever accents in film history. It was worse than his accent in Anaconda, honestly there were times when I couldn't understand what he was saying. The other performers weren't that much better either, Scott Baio especially was wasted. And the child performers were misguided, they just couldn't do anything with the script. And I do apologise here, but I don't think babies trying to behave like adults is cute or funny in the slightest.\n\nEven the camera work was next to abysmal, nothing more than flat and rushed. Shame really, because there was one or two nice bits of scenery. In fact, the only real half decent element of this this otherwise abysmal film was the music, and even that was forgettable at best. All in all, Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2 was nothing more than a piece of garbage, that was the low point of Jon Voight's acting career. 0/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_title": "I'd rather gargle with hydrochloric acid than see a \"Baby Geniuses 3\"!",
        "review_detailed_main": "Okay, the first movie from this series \"Baby Geniuses\" was so poorly received that reviewers were beside themselves castigating the film. It currently is ranked #73 on the IMDb Bottom 100 list. Yet, astoundingly, the film led to this even worse sequel--\"Baby Geniuses 2\"! This sort of sequel is a prime example how some people in Hollywood just need to get real jobs...or at least stop doing LSD! Unlike the first horrible piece of garbage that is \"Baby Geniuses\", this film manages to be significantly worse for several important reasons:\n\n1. It is totally unoriginal. While \"Baby Geniuses\" was dumb, it was somewhat original and perhaps the film makers naively thought the film would sell. Here, however, they knew they were producing a giant stinky diaper of a film from the onset--following the horrible drubbing the first film received--and yet they STILL made it!\n\n2. \"Baby Geniuses 2\" has some of the absolute worst computer work I've seen in a recent film. The babies are horribly dubbed as their computer generated lip movements didn't match--and in some cases looked really creepy.\n\n3. Jon Voight managed to do a much, much worse job as the villain compared to the combined talents of Christopher Lloyd and Kathleen Turner in the original. That took LOTS of effort! Lots and lots and lots of effort!\n\n4. A ninja baby! While one of the babies in the original film did some karate here and there, here we have an honest-to-goodness ninja baby--complete with ninja mask and insanely ridiculous wire-fu stunts.\n\n5. Two words about the second film that say it all...SCOTT BAIO!\n\n6. Even more pop culture references that no child would understand. Considering that 99.9% of the people who actually wanted to see the film were children, this is a serious problem.\n\n7. The @&*$ kids talk and talk and make commentary on EVERYTHING. It's like going to a movie with an annoying kid sitting next to you who thinks he's the host of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and talks throughout--but in reality, he is just an obnoxious child who won't shut up. PLEASE shut up!!! SHUT UP!!!! SHUT UP!!!!!!!\n\n8. Gadgets! Unlike the first film, this one gives the ninja kid all kinds of super gadgets, such as a car like the Batmobile that spouts flames out the back, a James Bond-like mini-copter and Dick Tracy communication devices.\n\n9. The ninja baby has his own version of the Bat Cave--complete with holograms and Willie Wonka-like accessories.\n\n10. In many ways, \"Baby Geniuses 2\" is like the first film merged with \"Spy Kids 2\"--another bad kids film. It manages to combine the worst qualities of each!\n\n11. The ninja kid is a Buddhist with super-powers. As a result, now nearly 1 billion Buddhists worldwide also hate this film. Instead of offending this religion, they should have attacked a fringe cult like the Movementarians.\n\n12. A romance between two teenagers that just seemed a bit creepy. Seeing two teens kiss who look a lot younger than their actual age made me feel a bit queasy. My 19 year-old said she felt the same.\n\n13. For the cost of \"Baby Geniuses 2\", they could have funded ten independent films...or more. While this isn't a huge budget film, it cost a lot of money for the special effects. What a sad waste.\n\n14. Towards the end of the film, several babies sprout super-powers. One is like Superman and can fly, one shoots magic arrows, one is a giant bouncy ball (how that can come in handy against the villains is anyone's guess) and one is \"Brain Boy\" (whatever that means).\n\n15. The last 10 minutes...oh, does it suck! No, it Mega-sucks!\n\n16. The end of the film rips off Bogie from \"Casablanca\"--what sorry sacrilege.\n\nOverall, this is truly a horrible film. While there might be films that look crappier or have worse production values, the fact that this one DOES have a decent budget and production values yet is this thoroughly horrible makes this an amazing film. Clearly, it deserves to be on IMDb's infamous list! At one point, one of the babies make a comment that would be the perfect description of this sequel--\"Oh no, I'm feeling nauseous again\"."

Thank goodness these don't come along that often.\n\nOther than a flatulence joke in the first 5 minutes of the film (now a requirement for children's cinema), the laughs were few and far between in the remaining 90 minutes of this movie. During the many long periods of boredom, many questions began racing through my head. Why are these babies talking? Why do we care? Why aren't they saying anything funny?\n\nI can only assume that Jon Voight has a grandchild/godchild/nephew/niece, for whom he dedicated this performance. There really could be no other plausible reason for such an actor to associate with something with so little merit."

This would have been great MST 3000 fodder - even \"Manos, Hands of Fate\" fares well against this. Again, most normal human beings couldn't even make a movie this bad if they tried.

To be honest, it's actually better than the first in the fact that it doesn't have a dated 90's feel to it, and the bad, corny jokes are... at least a bit better, even though there's even more than the first.\n\nQuick overview of the plot: Old man wants to run brainwashing TV station but a bunch of babies stop him. That bit of a plot alone is so mind- numbing; but in all truth, the true demographic [4-8 year olds] don't go for detail. To make up for it, adult jokes are dispersed cringingly.\n\nWith a 20 million dollar budget, half-baked special effects are thrown everywhere, tinted with mediocre lip-syncing.

The sets are ridiculous, the way it's shot is messy, and it feels more like if a Spy Kids movie were done even more horribly wrong than they were.\n\nI'm giving this a 4 because it could use something closer to the first, and it's not as terrible as a Friedberg-Seltzer movie or the like."

        "review_detailed_main": "The first \"Baby Geniuses\" movie was inane and boring enough, why make a sequel? Are studios that hard up to make money? That scared of trying something different for fear of losing money? I guess they figure going with a franchise that has a proved record of mediocrity is safer - at least you're not surprised when you lose money. This film is not campy or cheesy bad, it's just plain boring bad - the worst kind of cinematic experience.\n\nI guess my reason for writing a review of a movie this bad several years after its release is this - Parents, if you're looking for family-safe entertainment, you can do better than this type of film. Your kids are smarter than this. If they're young enough not to mind sitting through this film, then they are too young to enjoy any kind of movie anyways. For family-safe entertainment you can never go wrong with just about anything made by Pixar. Pixar knows how to make films that use CGI to accentuate already good plots and interesting characters, not as a substitute for them.\n\nAs for this film, it makes Gigli look like Citizen Kane. 20 years from now if there is a \"Mystery Science 4000\" to replace the now defunct MST3K, I'm sure this film will be one of the featured objects of ridicule... if the poor robots can stand the torment of sitting through it."

Although, I must admit I really liked \"A Christmas Story\". But this film was truly one of the worst films I've ever sat through. What was Jon Voight thinking when he accepted this role. Surely it couldn't have been purely financial. The guy has had a lot of paydays over the years.\n\nThere were a few young couples in the audience without their kids too. Man, that freaked me out. They didn't even walk out. That's scary. They can vote. No wonder Bush is our president. I wonder what they did last weekend. Go to the Yu-Gi-Oh movie. That's what I'm betting on. It's a scary world out there.\n\nOh and even worse, the ending set up a sequel. Mr. Clark, if you are reading this, if you dare to put a baby genuises 3 on film before my kid turns nine, I will hunt you down and maim you. That's a promise."

The premise had loads of possibilities - kids with superpowers -could have been funny, instead it was just unrelenting drivel.

I had to sit through this garbage while watching some kids one day, and I knew this movie wasn't good when even the kids lost interest a few minutes in. There are movies where the kids get into the action, they cheer on the good guys, or they involve themselves into the movie. Not this one. Superbabies entertained none of the kids, and left me wondering how this movie ever left the boardroom where the script was written. The movie did solve one question that had been burning inside of me for a while: Where has Scott Baio been? Here, he plays a father of one of the babies and director of a new daycare center that may or may not be integral in the plot to take over the world by the diabolical Biscane (Jon Voight). I can understand Baio being in this movie, he hasn't really been in demand of late. But when I see Voight perform in this movie, I wonder to myself \"Why?\" He's done some good work of late, notably in Holes and National Treasure, and then he plays some sort of super villain with a bad German accent who is derailed by 2 year-olds. He'll bounce back, he has to. The babies in the movie, who are supposed to be the stars, looks freaky to me. The voices do not sync up with the movie lips at all. I think the characters in South Park have better synchronization than these babies. And the movie is not funny either. Again, I go to the kids, where I noticed none of them laughed at all. Instead, they all wanted to read, or draw, or take a nap, or do their laundry. Anything to escape this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie goes beyond words. Saying that it has acting that makes me feel like throwing up is an understatement. Saying that it is an abomination on mankind that makes Hitler look like Ghandi is an understatement. Taking a copy of the DVD, setting it on fire, smashing it with a hammer, and throwing the pieces left over into a volcano is less than the true fate this movie deserves. I can call it any name I want to. In the end though it will defeat me with just how awful it is. If you got the strongest critics in the world together to watch five minutes of this they would rip their own eyes out in two. Well I should stop talking about how bad it is and get into what makes it bad. First off the acting just awful. Even John Voight an Oscar winner delivers one of the worst performances in movie history. Everyone simply makes me sick. The worst ones are the voice actors for the babies. They give by far the most annoying performance ever put to film. You could take Jar-Jar, the live-action Italian Pinnochio, everyone from Troll 2, everyone from Manos, and Eddie Murphy in 98% of every movie he is in together and it wouldn't be as bad. They have voices that make nails on a chalkboard sound like Motzart. They sound like they are the kids of whoever possessed Regan in The Exorcist. (Exorcist 2 never happened) Then we have the effects. They are pitiful. They are just so bland and lousy that it refuses to be comprehended. When you get to this colorful secret lair later in the film it feels so lifeless for some reason. Action scenes are more about annoying as hell puns in this movie then a sense of actual fighting that feels like fighting. It leaves you yawning at how boring it is. I know that it is supposed to be kid friendly, but Spy Kids has more tension than you and it wasn't even trying to be suspenseful. Fighting is so bland in this movie that it feels more fun to watch people throw punches at the air. Also the effects on the babies mouths is simply atrocious. Then we get to the real reason why this movie fails. The story is a joke. A deaf blind monkey that is drunk, high, and born with no legs or arms could right something better than this. Four babies work with superbaby to stop a man from taking over the world. If you haven't slit your wrists yet you are really strong. As for dialogue it is mostly made up of this. Annoying baby conversations, moron adults, moron villains, 16 year old exposition about babies. Kill me please!!!! The director of this died in a car accident after this. As you can tell by this movie it was most likely karma or intoxication after a day of shooting. (Yes I am aware that he made A Christmas Story, but that does not make up for this) This movie aims low, crashes, and burns to death. It is a movie that was shot on 30 million, but it looks like it was shot on 300,000. It is so bad that even if you want to bash y0ourself don't watch it. I wasn't that mean on movies before this. If a movie was bad I would say it was bad. Now after this I see in awfulvision. When I see a movie that is really bad I force its head in the dirt and watch it die slowly. This is simply crap times infinity.\n\n0 stars out of 4"

Sarcasm runs deep on the web.\n\nTo be honest, I have never watched this movie. I've exposed myself to enough horrendous shlock in my time that I don't need one more thing sucking away all that is good and decent from my life. But it doesn't matter, at all. You literally don't need to see this movie to know it is absolute trash. And it's not even the fact that it's a sequel to a horrifically bad film in it's own right. All you need to know about Baby Geniuses 2 is this:\n\nOn IMDb's list of the lowest rated movies of all time, according to a user vote, this film comes in second place to a propaganda film for a fascist government run by a murderous dictator.\n\nSo why did I bother reviewing it? Boredom. Another day in the internet."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I uttered the words, \"Baby Geniuses 2\" to man in the box office at the movie theaters I had a certain sense of shame and embarrassment. The only reason I went was because we had a group of about 15 film majors that thought it would be funny to all go see the late-night showing of this movie. We were right! From the second we saw the flashback to 1962 Berlin, Germany we knew this was going to be sooooo ridiculous that there wouldn't be any problem finding stuff to laugh at. The dialogue and the \"concept\" of this movie are so prepostorous that I contemplated dropping my major in film once it was over because I thought that if this movie could make it to the big screen, then Hollywood is truly dead. I understand, this is suppose to be a kid's movie.\n\nDoesn't work as that even! There was actually a few young children in the theater and they were crying after about 15 min. into it. There's too many special effects and loud fight scenes to make it enjoyable for a child. Plus, even a baby can probably tell how much crap this is. One of the funniest moments was during a part where they're pulling a mini-van into the head baby's secret lair behind the Hollywood sign...I know, that's enough to be funny....but if you look in the upper left hand corner in the screen you can CLEARLY see a crew member just messing around behind a bush. That's how poor quality this is. Well, that's all I'm going to waste my time saying about this movie. If you have a group of friends who want to just laugh they're butts off for 2 hours (way toooo long), then be brave and go see Baby Geniuses 2, it'll be an experience you unfortunately will never forget."

What exactly were the people at Sony Pictures doing the day someone made the decision to fund this film? And then after the film was in the can did someone notice that it should be shelved or released for TV other than an expensive theatrical project?\n\nAfter sitting through the ordeal, I really cannot tell you much about the story. Jon Voight is a 'Nazi' type villain that goes around being foiled by these babies that speak in words that must be in some foreign language because I was not sure if it was English. The viewer is left unable to understand the script and unable to comprehend the plot.\n\nI can only guess that people thought looking at babies walking around in diapers, talking gibberish, would be sweet. However we learn that what the babies make in their diapers is exactly what this film is worth. Absolutely one of the worse films made."

With a proper director and scenario this movie could have been a hit, because the idea in general of babies knowing more than what we know is quite intriguing. There sure will be no superbabies three after this flop. If I saw this scenario I would have never ever approved it. How can they still try to sell it for around 20 dollars?

Did the writers actually believe this would get better ratings if people saw something from \"The Great Escape\" in this movie except with babies as prisoners? Maybe they thought people would say, \"Awww, how cute. A baby as a prisoner.\" Rugrats is definitely better than this. And it was just stupid how babies surpass adults in knowledge and intellect while they still crap their diapers and cry. And I forget, wasn't there a bad guy who wanted to take away nap-time? Really stupid. If they're \"super babies\" then they don't need naps. The writers probably over-exaggerated and thought that they should combine every important element of a genius but still have silly baby characteristics. I wonder if they saw the Justice League and said, \"How about the Justice League as babies? Ingenious!\" I even remember someone saying they WANTED to see this movie and all I could think was that they had to have been completely dumb. This movie couldn't have been made any worse."

Whoever gave this stinker the greenlight should be hung, drawn, and quartered, or hog-tied, pushed down, into, some snake water. Some of you may remember a pleasant scene in Baby geniuses, wherein a Baby wearing a tux knocks out a hobo who requests some change. The homeless schmutz, who lands in a toilet stall, closes his eyes, as if unconscious, and then decides to open them, as though he didn't realize that the film was still rolling. Well, no surprise! Baby Geniuses 2 contains equally bad, if not worse material, such as a baby who fires cupid's arrows to create love between evil corporate goonies, or a baby in a beachball, who bounces from one end of a room to another, without any physical harm, nor mental damage. Of course, a terrible movie would be nothing without its star, and who better to create this horrible steaming pile than Jon Voight, aka Angelina Jolie's father, of Midnight Cowboy fame. I seriously can't imagine who even came up with the storyline for this movie without bursting out with a combination of laughter and indigestion. 1 star is too gracious for this movie.

This movie is so bad, Uwe Boll looks down on it! This makes me yearn for the Super Mario Bros. movie! I watched the movie over and over, hoping to find a hidden joke. Looks like I did. \"Viewers are morons and will watch anything with 'cute' babies.\" Why the quotes around cute? They aren't cute! They're annoying!

Does this studio not employ script readers ? Why on earth is Jon Voight even in this terrible movie ? Has he finally given up and surrendered his career to his pillow lipped daughter Angelina Jolie ? As a one time Oscar winner this is a pretty steep drop for Voight. Next step down is porn . Voight plays a Nazi type character with brain washing on his mind and to do this he goes to a Daycare(?) center run by Chachy(Scott Baio) One of the babies lives in a funky cave situated behind the Hollywood sign that is filled with junk left over from SpyKids 3 . The first BG made like a nickel throughout its theatrical run this one will probably do the same it has tax write-off written all over it. Do not see this movie as it will induce irretrievable brain damage. This is about the dumbest excuse for a movie EVER!!!!! Zero of Five Stars for BG2"

        "review_detailed_main": "SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses 2 is the follow-up to 1999's Baby Geniuses. In it, four smart babies team up with 7-year-old \"defender of children everywhere\" Kahuna to prevent media mogul Bill Biscane's plot to enslave the world through powerful subliminal TV programming.\n\nBabies start jumping at day-care center Bobbins World, in the stewardship of Stan and Jean Bobbins. (Stan's brother from the first film owns the center but is busy saving children overseas.) The Bobbins are preparing for the arrival of Mr. Biscane, who, at this point in the film, is an internationally recognized advocate of children and orphans. Biscane has chosen the Bobbins' upscale L.A. day care to premier his new television show for kids. Stan hopes the exposure will turn the day care into a nationally known brand, \"the McDonald's of day care.\" Biscane has other ideas.\n\nAs the Bobbinses work themselves into a high-stress lather over the near visit, four smart babies:Archie, Finkleman, Rosita and Alex sit talking to one another in a play area. To the ordinary watcher, it looks as if they're just talking baby talk. But Jean becomes convinced that they're actually having a conversation. And she's right: Archie is telling the other toddlers about the legend of Kahuna, a 7-year-old \u00fcberspy who prevented the evil Nazi-like commander Kane's plot to enslave orphaned East German children.\n\nThe other babies dismiss Archie's tall tale. But they soon discover that Kahuna is no legend when he comes to their rescue\u2014which they desperately need after getting unwittingly dragged into Biscane's malevolent sights\u2014tricked out with all the requisite Bond-like hardware, including a snazzy rocket-powered three-wheeler. Along the way, Kahuna empowers the babies to believe in themselves, revealing each one's superpower!.\n\nThis movie is so great .I still do not know why it is heavily underrated. It was an enjoyable thing to do watching the movie on DVD and I am so certain it would be magical to see this excellent movie in 3D at the movies."

Well I watched it without been interrupted. What I can say... Hmmm.... I got depressed cause after first 15 min I was forcing me to watch i till then end. For the name of god! Why anyone by any reason will make such a horrible movie? I was thinking of that the rest of the day. Got a headache and after getting aspirin slept on sofa. Next day I realized that I'm still not over this movie and catch my thought that I want to kill the people who made this movie. Lucky for me that instead of keeping thinking of that I just decided to write this review.\n\nThis is absolutely worst movie in the whole cinematography.

It was bad enough when you made the first one and the second one is terrible! I do not recommend this film at all! If you really want to enjoy this film, get drunk or get high - maybe it will seem a little bit more funnier, but to be honest I don't even think that will work!

        "review_detailed_main": "A few friends and I loaded this up for bad movie night right after \"U.S. Catman In Lethal Track\". The contrast was pretty startling, and demonstrated the huge difference between a commercially produced, large budget disaster like this and quirky, extremely low budget, foreign oddities like the kind featured on MST3K. Those low budget gems, for the most part anyway, had some creative spark behind them that went wildly awry. Stuff like \"Monster A-Go-Go\" was put together by small groups of people who at least cared about what they were putting together but had no idea how.\n\nHaving said that, Superbabies is a whole different animal. It's coldly calculated to appeal to 5 year olds and somehow still misses the mark. I know kids don't mind disjointed action as long as it's flashy and fast paced, but there's too much going on here that makes absolutely no sense. There's this really creepy, drawn out back-story about how the King Baby, Kahuna, is actually an old man trapped in a child's body. Not only is it disconcerting and weird, but I can't imagine a small child following all the labored exposition getting us there.\n\nIn fact, the babies themselves don't really do anything. They just stand around in diapers while Kahuna and the adults bray like jackasses and make fools of themselves in the most irritating ways possible. Like Jon Voight, who can't even be bothered with a passable accent. Anyone remember the MST episode \"Angels Revenge\"? Where Jim Backus was playing a right-wing militant and you didn't believe it for a second while he puttered around, painfully phoning it in with a look of horrified embarrassment? That's Jon Voight in this film. He produced the first one for some God-unknown reason, and I guess he felt compelled to try and salvage this one.\n\nAll that said, it's pretty fascinating how poor this is. Everything looks so lazy and sloppy, like everyone just shrugged and said \"screw it, it's Baby Geniuses for Christ's sake, who cares?\" The Bubble Baby in the orange ball suit has a particularly horrendous CGI effect he's plastered into toward the end that had us all crying out in outrage over how lame and lazy it was.\n\nThese poor kids will never live this down."

It's bad enough that it took a herculean effort on my part to make it to the end! I bet Jon Voight regretted his long relationship with producer Steven Paul after making this movie, though Voight has himself to blame for giving such an over-the-top performance that it isn't funny to watch. Shoddy special effects, main characters (the babies) who are extremely annoying, and a plot that has a number of loose ends are additional problems the movie has. It's all directed in such an unenthusiastic way by Bob Clark that you wonder why he agreed to participate in the first place. No, not the worst movie ever made... though I think it deserves a place in the IMDb's 100 lowest-rated movies."

Worse of all this movie managed to get almost 10 million dollars at the domestic box office while brilliant films go unnoticed.\n\nAvoid at all costs."

Of course there has only been one movie that I have never been able to conquer, for fear of my personal well being.\n\nThat movie is \"Baby Geniuses\".\n\nThe movie is unflinchingly bad, and it showed what happens when washed up actors (in that case, Christopher Lloyd, Kathleen Turner, Peter MacNicol, etc.) get another shot at immortality. The story revolved around a baby that was really hardcore super smart, and his twin who revolt with other babies and try to destroy the corporation run by Lloyd and Turner. They win, hallelujah.\n\nOf course, we're not talking about that movie, we're talking about the ACTUAL SEQUEL \"Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2\".\n\nHow this thing got green lit, I have no idea. This must be how Satan works his way into our minds.\n\nThis movie continues the trend of having washed up actors in starring roles, and this year's line-up might just be better than the other. In the blue corner, we have Jon Voight, a perpetually useful actor known for his useless roles (see Anaconda), and in the red corner we have SCOTT BAIO. Three words: Charles In Charge. That's all that I have to say.\n\nFor a kid's film , this lacks imaginative ideas. For an adult film, this lacks actors, a story, a plot, a writer, and for that matter, reason.\n\nAvoid this movie like the black plague."

Ignore that though. The menial topics of contemporary news can not, in any dignified manner, overshadow the sheer and awesome power of this infantile masterpiece.\n\nOf course I haven't watched this bloody film, who in the right mind would?

But don't worry though, the SUPER BABIES come in and stops the bad guy.\n\nThis movie is perfect in every way possible. But if your under 18 you might want to see it with your parents. It has intense violence and it even has some cursing. Speaking of the violence, the fight scenes in this movie makes The Matrix look like sissy fighting.\n\nThis movie is one of the best things ever.

        "review_detailed_main": "I viewed this film on television, a French language version, over the Christmas(2007)Holidays while visiting in Alma Quebec, Canada (region of Lac St-Jean). I missed the opening credits and had no idea who had directed this 'delightful' work. Before long I was guessing this wee treat to be the work of Bob Clark, and am now delighted to learn that he is indeed the director. Few of those watching with me spoke English, and even though this film is very \"American\" in every aspect, everything seemed to work for this audience, who truly enjoyed all that was offered. Bob's work, in my opinion, from Black Christmas to the present had occasionally been 'uneven'(although come to think of it, what director has not, at times, been 'uneven' over a career) I think A Christmas Story is his best work, a film I enjoyed immensely. However, Super Babies is a darn fine match and Bob is able to capture the essentials required in childhood adventure - something in it for kids of all ages. I'll miss him, and I will never forget the \"little boy\" in him. DMR"

This is our Charlie Chaplin. The Magnum Opus of this generation.

One standards of laughter though this ranks up there with such recent classics as Old School, Anchorman, and the 40 Year Old Virgin but unlike those this doesn't have to appeal to horny teens who don't have morals that tend to have bad taste in movies anyways. Trust me on this one, this movie does not deserve to be in the bottom 100, especially not the bottom five."

Better not watch movies for under 12 anymore."

I mean, I'm an action film fan, and this is a family film, so I thought this film would be excellent to see! A few things to note, though: 1. I like the trailer! Everything is funny, from the bouncing boy (My little brothers were laughing!), to...well, I don't want to describe it, but it has something to do with...Cupid Girl! 2. Also about the trailer: \"Shake It Up\" by The Cars - I love that 80s music! 3. Don't Walk...Crawl! Yeah, I definitely would have liked to crawl with a million other jealous moviegoers to the theater to see this movie! These things about the trailer definitely convinced me to have a go at this movie! Have you?"

I wish at the end Kahuna would bring Bounce Boy with him because they would make an awesome crime-fighting duo, they're my favourite hero-sidekick duo. I hope they make a 3rd movie that is all about Bounce Boy and his adventures, it would be very cool and I would pay a lot of money to see. I wish it had more Bounce Boy in it, though. I enjoyed every scene he was in but I wish he had more lines. He was the only character I could stand seeing, the other babies were so annoying and I had to stop myself from projectile vomiting intensely whenever the other babies showed up on-screen. Other than that, the movie was amazing and I loved it a lot I will be telling all of my friends about it and rewatching it every day. #stanbounceboy."

My favourite part was the whole movie. I actually had to to go to hospital over nearly having a heart attack over how good this is. I especially liked the Holy diaper grenades thrown by the catholic pope. John was the best baby of them all he fully destroyed everyone and could easily beat all the other puny baby's in a fight even if they all came at him at once, he's basically thor. I was especially surprised when I saw the justice league come out of no where to try and kill the baby's like calm down Bruce banner they're just kids. There is so much I could write I'm just so excited about how good this movie was, I'm lost for words. Imagine actually killing a ferret with a bouncy ball like WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my days. Basically all I can say is watch the movie it'll sweep you of your feet over how amazing it is this is truly what terminator should have been (I think they might have even stole alot of the concept)."
