        "review_detailed_main": "Human Centipede 2 is like watching a crime scene. Besides our nasty, degenerate villain in Martin, there is no character development at all. What is on the screen is just violent act after violent act, culminating in a slightly open ending. I was expecting to see some really horrible acts of violence against bodies, and that's exactly what I got. I didn't enjoy it one bit. However, I cannot deny the effect it had upon me. I had to watch the Simpsons for an hour following this film so I could feel normal again. Physically, this is the most disturbing film I've seen. I have seen worse in extreme cinema when you are actually invested in the characters, but that is impossible here. This movie is not for the squeamish at all, in fact a scene or two forced me to turn away and gag slightly. It sucks to admit that as I consider myself a seasoned genre fan, but yeah, certain parts were really freaking gross. Was there any tension? Well the first one elicited a few genuine scares but here, the fear is for what your eyes are going to be subjected to next. Watch at your own risk."

Why are people so desperate to work in a movie that they would subject themselves to such degradation? As an actor, there i no amount of money or notoriety that would convince me to do something so horrendous. It's just sick for the sake of being sick. It doesn't even make sense. Martin works in a parking garage to find victims yet no one ever notices his actions or him coming to work covered in blood. Sick, vile and disgusting. The first movie is Citizen Kane compared to this garbage. Tom Six should NEVER be allowed near a computer, a camera or any amount of cash EVER. I would give this minus 10 if allowed."

        "review_detailed_main": "In my review of the first, umm, segment of Tom Six's \"Human Centipede\" series, I stated that it was a very difficult film to review as it's inherently meant to alienate and disgust \u2013 so how to judge it evenly? I had no such problem with The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) as not only does it retain (and amplify) the revoltingness of the original, but strips away any twisted charm, tension, good performances and frequent tongue-in-cheek execution that made \"First Sequence\" better than it had any right to be.\n\nMany haphazardly brand films they dislike as \"worthless,\" but some movies are genuinely without any merit. \"Full Sequence\" is such a rarity. This sequel is artless, humorless, boring, without style (well, it is in black and white, so it must be high-class), purpose, or cleverness, and is generally off-putting, but never haunting or lasting. The only purpose seems to be in Tom Six's mind, in that he wanted to one-up himself. He succeeded in scope, but failed in every other aspect.\n\nThe opening scene reveals to us that the entire first movie was just that: a cinematic endeavour. Cut to Martin, a lonely and infinitely unhinged parking lot attendant who becomes obsessed with the film and further obsesses over creating his own humanoid monstrosity with twelve victims \u2013 an addition of nine. You see, these unlucky folks will be surgically attached mouth to anus, thereby connecting the gastric system, giving birth to a human centipede. His plan involves shooting his targets in the leg, bludgeoning them with a crowbar, tossing them into the back of his van and driving them to a grungy warehouse to await their fate. This drawn-out portion of the movie slogs along as Martin collects his subjects in a rythmic, monotonous pace with no sense of impending dread or sympathy for his victims. The camera seemingly just rolls for the hell of it.\n\nWhile the original benefited from a deliciously deranged performance from Dieter Laser as the mad doctor, Laurence B. Harvey's Martin never speaks, is grotesque in his appearance and mannerisms and has no interesting motives or backstory except that he was apparently sexually abused by his father. In fact the entire second half of the film contains no dialogue, as by this point all the characters' mouths are otherwise full (I apologize for that imagery). When the poop did flow, I was both bored and otherwise desensitized from the previous grotesque events and simply wanted the experience to end. A backhanded aim of Six may have been to craft a movie that nobody could sit through, and he did succeed, but not in the way he likely intended. I felt my time was being wasted, not that I was being shocked to new extremes.\n\nThe only people I could recommend this movie to would be those like myself who enjoyed the first and are curious about the follow-up, but I would have to tack on the disclaimer that they will be disappointed and viewing could even diminish the bizarre appeal of the first. But I suppose if you truly love fecal matter, back-room surgery, blood, torture, infanticide, profanity, child abuse and (of course) centipedes, you will be in cinematic bliss. Six already plans to finish his vision with a third movie entitled Human Centipede (Final Sequence) and after fulfilling the worries I had that he would one-up himself to a fault with this movie, I quiver at the load of dung he has in store for us to cap the trilogy.\n\nRead my review of the original: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1467304/reviews-40"

        "review_detailed_main": "Actually I should be grateful to Tom Six\u0085 Thanks to him and his demented movie, I finally know where to draw my own personal line when it comes to tolerating cinematic smut! The ideal way to describe this movie is to simply write down as many synonyms for the word \"repulsive\" you can think of! So here goes: \"The Human Centipede II: Full sequence\" is revolting, sickening, disgusting, loathsome, degrading, nauseating, appalling, despicable, vile, heinous, nefarious and absolutely positively depraved! The first film already caused quite a bit of commotion and controversy because of its plot and a handful of shocking sequences, but I swear the original looks like a politically correct Disney family flick compared to the totally messed up sequel! Not only does the concept of creating a human centipede gets enlarged and illustrated a lot more graphically, also the characters and sub plots are much more perverted and insane than in \"First Sequence\". I realize this will sound as a recommendation to all the sick puppies amongst you, but this is truly one of the most repugnant movies ever made. In spite of the emphasis more than obviously lying on gore and shock-factor, I nevertheless have to admit that the film features a number of ingenious story lines and creative twists. The whole basic plot and set up, for example, is surprisingly inventive. The sequel considers the original film in fact as a purely fictional \"film\" and thus the events and unorthodox medical experiments of Dr. Heiter were never real. However, the protagonist of part two \u2013 the obese and mentally handicapped midget named Martin \u2013 is addicted to watching this crazy movie and becomes obsessed with the idea of creating his very own (and bigger) human centipede. I can't deny that I find this idea intriguing as a starting point for a sequel. Writer/director Tom Six also generates a suitably grim and disturbing surrounding around pivot character Martin. He lives with his mother but she hates Martin with a passion. Why? Because her husband is in prison as Martin couldn't keep his pedophilic nightly visits secret. Martin works as a concierge in an underground parking lot where he captures his victims, but also bashes people's heads in with a crowbar and masturbates using sandpaper! He brings his centipede victims - all 12 of them, including a very pregnant woman \u2013 to a raunchy hangar and accomplishes his dream, which leads to many gross tableaux, I assure you. Multiple images that I can't even begin to describe truly give a whole new meaning to the words tasteless and immoral. When approaching the grand finale, you may expect scenes featuring excrement, rape, miscarriage and gratuitous torture/mutilation. Don't even consider watching \"The Human Centipede II\" \u2013 not even out of curiosity \u2013 if you have a bit of virtue left inside yourself. Laurence R. Harvey gives away a peculiar and remarkable performance as Martin. He is so convincingly perverted and deviant that I sincerely doubt if he's even a normal person in real life... I don't want to know him at least, that's for sure. The film is entirely shot in black and white, which perhaps makes the gruesomeness and on screen filth slightly more digestible, but primarily it increases the sober and grim atmosphere of it all. Other elements that contribute to this are the minimal use of dialogs and/or soundtrack and the nihilistic narrative tone. It maybe feels weird to admit, but technically speaking \"The Human Centipede II\" is actually a competent effort. Apparently there's already a third installment in the making, but I might just spare myself the hideous aftertaste in my mouth and stomach."

Not for it to be the sickfest that Tom Six promised in the early teaser trailer, but for Tom Six to actually create something lasting with the infamy he gained through the previous film.\n\nThe Human Centipede itself wasn't all that bad I thought personally. Twisted sure, outlandish definitely. However, aside from the poor show of acting from the American student girls early on in the film, the standard of acting was good. The plot was linear, shocking, and kept you gripped to your seat, or the toilet bowl for as long as the movie was running. The film itself also came in under the radar. My friend came home once and said he had just watched a movie called 'The Human Centipede.' He then asked me to imagine what comes to mind when I think of those words. Of course I was way off, but by this point I just had to watch it out of intrigue alone.\n\nThe second film is none of the above. Indeed, it is sick, twisted, and outlandish; and then some. But it just isn't original, clever, or even remotely logical.\n\nI don't want to go into the plot and explain who does what, aside to say that there is no real protagonist, and pretty much everybody in the film is either an antagonist, or deserves to die. There is a moment where you think that one woman will come through as some sort of hero, but then she does the most insane thing I have ever seen in a film. You'll know it when you see it: if you see the uncut version.\n\nTom Six is taking his audience for a ride, and not a good one. He's laughing at the people paying the ticket price and stupid they were to trust him and his film making ability.\n\nThe majority of the movie is shot entirely in black and white except for one part of the movie that has touchings of brown, in a similar fashion to the way blood is portrayed in Frank Millar's Sin City: have a quick guess which part that is. Note: that same scene that lasted a minute in the original lasts for ten whole minutes in this laughable sequel.\n\nI said to my housemate after the credits rolled that watching this movie was like eating an insanely hot curry, or camping out at a festival; neither are particularly enjoyable by the end, but at least you can tell all of your friends you did it."

        "review_detailed_main": "What this singular piece of nastiness has going for it in the main is brevity, no film of 88 minutes really ever outstays its welcome. Tom Six feels like a guy who knows what buttons to push, he introduces a minor character who is a kind of cartoon of the UK doctor / serial killer Harold Shipman, whose educated, imperturbable, casually degraded outlook is like acid in your face. There's also an incredibly disturbing line that evokes the main character's messed up childhood, \"Crying will only make daddy's willy harder\".\n\nMartin is an obese middle-aged nighttime security guard, who lives with his mother, who blames him for having his father sent to jail (i.e. being there for him to abuse). He is fantastically ugly, a stigma which in Western society leads to ostracisation. Martin is looking at these cards he's been dealt, which ain't great, and decides it's time for the proverbial to hit the fan, which is to say he'd like to try and re-enact his favourite DVD, The Human Centipede.\n\nThe British censors (and no doubt those of other countries will follow suit), have spared us a scene of a mother brutally killing her own newborn by mistake, of a coil of barbed wire being used as a marital aid, and like their forebears, the censors of Witchfinder General, had to ponder on just how many bludgeons with an axe, or in this case teeth removed by hammer blow, are acceptable, and decided on a lower number than the director.\n\nThe film is not quite squared away in terms of plot plausibility, but does what it can.\n\nI actually found the movie implausibly human, what Martin ends up doing seems, on the face of it, entirely logical (which is not to say that everyone who is abused becomes an abuser). The film seems to have a message that people are marginalised and forgotten about at our peril, that society is judged by the people who behave the worst.\n\nTwo of Six's gambles that pay off extremely well are shooting the movie in black and white, and having Martin remain dialogue-less throughout. His implacability and remorselessness say all that needs to be said about someone who has been kept as an animal and poked one too many times. The black and white shooting literally portrays a miserable world drained of any colour."

In a nutshell, a very odd looking, obese character (with a sweating problem just to make him more distasteful than he already is) is infatuated with this director's previous film, taking copious notes on it. He is inspired to emulate the doctor of the previous movie by repeatedly clubbing innocents over the head with a crowbar and/or shooting them and then holding them all captive in a dank garage. Why these characters do not aid each other in the many hours that he is not around is puzzling. They are bound with a few pieces of duct tape. It would take a minimal effort to release the person next to you. Instead, these characters just squirm around on the floor until the wheezing, asthmatic can return to do something else sadistic to them. But, this \"film\" is not about thinking. It's about seeing how many disturbing images can be stuffed into 90 mins of space. Apparently, this director is striving for some sort of title by seeing just how worthless a product he can put out and still get others to pay for it. (I didn't pay) Poor man seems a bit disturbed himself."

It's so grotesque, violent, over-sexualized and exploitive that it's near impossible to describe it in general, let alone here, where reviews should be \"PG\" rated. So I will try my best.\n\n\"Human Centipede II\" is a strange hybrid of meta-fiction and satire of itself and of the first film (and is, to its credit, quite funny in a very \"gallows\" humor kind of way), while also being an extraordinarily grotesque and depraved \"body horror film\" at the same time. It's one of those movies that is borderline parody of its own concept (again, in a meta-fiction way), in the same vain as \"Gremlins 2\" or \"The Princess Bride.\"\n\nEssentially the plot is as follows- \"Martin\", a mentally handicapped man whom has suffered from rampant abused his whole life, becomes fascinated by the original \"Human Centipede\" film (which is a movie-within-a-movie in this sequel), and begins to kidnap various people in order to re- create the grotesque experiment from the original film.\n\nI will not spoil anything else, but the film in its second half, is essentially a much more grotesque remake of the first film, albeit with different characters and different motivations.\n\nI really must give credit where it is due. Tom Six has crafted a beautiful film, at least in terms of visuals. The black and white photography has a fantastic contrast and despite being stylized, has an iconic look to it. I also found his direction in terms of camera placement and movement, though a bit over-reliant on the \"shaky cam syndrome\", to be vibrant, kinetic and clear. The film is also well- edited and the atmosphere just reeks of tension and humor.\n\nLike the first film, the acting is a mixed bag. Laurence Harvey, whom portrays the villainous \"Martin\" is actually a revelation, delivering a character that so far as I can remember, doesn't speak one work, yet manages to garner a lot of sympathy and horror. He's clearly unable to comprehend (or just unwilling to) the dramatic extent of what he does in this film, and his troubled past, which is alluded to, makes you feel sorry for him despite his sins. Ashlynne Yennie, one of the stars of the first film, returns, this time playing herself, as she is kidnapped by Martin due to her connection to the original film. Other centipede members (12 in all) are played by newcomers, and though I won't go into all of them, they are all adequate, though some sore thumbs bring the score down.\n\nThe script, as I said, is an extreme and bizarre example of meta-fiction with elements of satire, parody, body-horror, family drama and many other genres thrown in. It's a compilation of differing (and sometimes conflicting) ideas. And it is interesting, though the script suffers at times due to disjointed pacing, clunky dialog and an over-reliance on shocks.\n\nAll of that being said- I will address the one thing this movie does extremely well, and at times perhaps too well. The gore. This movie is one of the few films I've seen that made me have to look away. I'm a huge gore-hound, and I love my gory movies (I was able to sit through \"August Underground\", \"Cannibal Holocaust\", \"Salo\" and other extreme films), but this film took it to a disturbing new high... or low, depending on how you look at it. Featuring everything from realistic portrayals of teeth being tapped out with hammers, to skin being flayed and stapled, to depictions of graphic sexual violence, this movie will make your skin crawl, and may prove to be too much for even seasoned veterans. Be warned going in.\n\nThat all being said, I think fans of horror should see this film at least once. I've seen it twice, and I still don't know whether I love it or hate it. It's one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen, but it also has a highly enjoyable self-awareness and sense of humor, and I think that's what sets it apart from other extreme films. I'm giving this a 5 out of 10, because I don't know what else to give it.\n\n(EDIT: Upon two more viewings, my affections have grown for this film, and I updated my score to suit its entertainment value and satirical hilarity!)"

Harvey) dreams of creating a 12-person centipede and sets out to realize his sick fantasy.\n\nI loved this movie, and I think it is probably receiving lower ratings than it should because it will not appeal to wide audiences. First of all, you obviously have to be a fan of the first film, so that narrows down the audience for this one. And then, you have to appreciate the fact this is a fictional story referencing a fictional story.\n\nFinally, I think you have to grasp that this is a very dark comedy -- possibly the darkest comedy ever made. Is it a horror film? Absolutely. It contains one of the most terrifying scenarios possible. But it is clear from certain elements (such as the brown splat on the screen and the psychiatrist) that there is a dark, twisted humor here, too.\n\nLaurence Harvey is incredible, and plays the part of Martin flawlessly. You might even feel sorry for him, or have a certain sense of compassion. Is he sick? Yes. But he fully cognizant of what he is doing? It would appear not.\n\nRecommended for fans of the first film. Everyone else, this is not for you."

For Martin, he's going to do what other people are not capable of doing.\n\nThis is my first review on a film on IMDb, and the reason I picked this film is due to one word; controversy. I ordered it on demand last night, and calmed my nerves because I knew what i was heading into. All threw my head, I was thinking about how Tom Six wants this to be art, and he really went all out with the B&W (With a little funny twist).\n\nRight from the start, the film had more blood than the first Human Centipede had, and from there on, everyone will know you're in for a long ride. I've seen A Serbian Film, and the hype for it did not shock me, shock value is pretty much the only rule horror directors want to go by, and only few have great shock value.\n\nThe story revolves around a mental Security Guard, named Martin, who lives with his suicidal mother, and is secretly obsessed with The Human Centipede film, it's his sexual fantasy to create his own, but not with three, but 12 people. Martin is a creepy man, and the first half hour of the film really created amazing atmosphere and sympathy towards Martin.\n\nNow, is this Art? Not by a long shot, Six wanted to create Art by making this film black and white, trying to categorize this film with classics. In my opinion, art is something beautiful, something that can touch is by visual, and Martin believes the Human Centipede is Art, he thinks it's beautiful. But to a lot more people, it seemed like a desperate try to create something original, which it did, but in the end, didn't create the hype it was needed.\n\nDoes this have great shock value for the sensitive nerves? Yes, and it achieved it, but that's all it is. You can barely tell if anyone had good performances, the only one I found believable was Martin, and Laurence Harvey nailed his part. But for everyone else, you can't really judge since they all had a minute of screen time.\n\nThe film has more plot holes than swish cheese, and it bothered the heck out of me, I understand that you need disbelief but this was ridiculous, anyone with a brain could get this guy caught, but I think if the movie ended the way it seemed, then the plot holes don't matter.\n\nMy overall opinion, it's an okay horror film, if you want to be disgusted, then this is you're exact cup of tea, but looking for something beautiful, stay away.\n\n5/10"

Complete waste of time, energy, and I regret it altogether. I guess I had to see the \"bad hype\" for myself. Totally lives up to it. Utter crap.

        "review_detailed_main": "I think what really killed the original Human Centipede film was publicity. Normally, publicity for a film is good because if it's causing controversy or causing a debacle, chances are, its box office revenue will be larger. The Human Centipede (First Sequence) would've been a lot better if it was a little cult thing, rather than a big mainstream film. If it had been more subtly introduced to the public rather than boasting its twisted set up maybe I would've felt more excited to see it.\n\nNow I'm faced with the sequel. A sequel that we all know would happen. The Human Centipede II comes branded with another gimmicky \"Sequence\" title, this time referring to it as \"Full Sequence.\" It definitely is full of itself, and it definitely is a full dose of shock value and gore. This sequel is so depraved, grotesque, and ugly that any horror fan should feel obligated to watch it.\n\nBut is it good? That is the question. It truly isn't, but it definitely keeps one thing the same; the elegant way of filming. With a camera in hand, Tom Six can do wonders. He can make the most disgusting concept appealing just by the way he puts it on film. One person I feel for is David Meadows, the cinematographer on the film. If this film wasn't so deranged and twisted, he probably would've been handed some sort of award. The cinematography in this film was truly a great aspect to such an already atrocious concept.\n\nThe story follows Martin (Harvey), an overweight, asthmatic, clammy-skinned, mentally ill parking garage attendant who becomes obsessed with the original Human Centipede film. Yes, the original film exists in the film as a regular movie. A true paradox. Martin begins to brutally beat people with a crowbar, and soon gets the idea to create a human centipede of twelve people.\n\nHe lives with his mother, has had one checkered childhood, and suffers verbal abuse from everyone he encounters. Martin believes that since he has garnered so much material from the film and compiled it in a scrapbook, he can make an effective centipede. The result is explicit, and since Martin isn't the sharpest tool in the box, a staple gun, duck tape, and a hammer work more in his favor than a heavy sleeping drug and some stitches.\n\nMartin is played Laurence R. Harvey, who does a decent job of putting himself in the role a crazed, mentally unstable human being. Martin doesn't have any lines of dialog in the entire film except for excessive wheezing, coughing, and sobbing. That's an interesting element, but it makes the film easy to drift away from.\n\nThis also serves as one of the most beautifully done black and white films I've ever seen. The color is greatly saturated, and the tonality of the contrast is exquisite. But, after all, I did rate this film low so instead of praising the minor qualities that made some of the film watchable I should be discussing what made the film bad.\n\nHere we go. To begin with, the concept is never going to catch on. It's a sick, idiotic concept that may be medically accurate, but sure isn't sufficient enough for film. Just like my prime complaint with the first film, once you get past the fact that this depraved human being is sewing people from mouth to anus the film becomes incredibly old and uninspired. It's sleepily, if at all, written and combines artless shock in hopes of making a good film.\n\nWhat kind of shock do we get, lovely injections of centipedes where the sun don't shine, extremely bloody torture scenes that could put Saw to shame, a very ghastly scene involving the emptying of bodily waste, and a sick masturbation scene. We also see some more things of great shock, but I dare not spoil them. After all, isn't the gag reflex one gets from seeing these films the only reason why people keep coming back? I have no problem with horror films, but The Human Centipede II is solely created from the ground up on shocking elements. This is more a competition for the most grotesque scenes rather than a feature length film. Yes, Harvey, the cinematography, and the black and white tonality complement the film in a very minor way, but still, it's hard to appreciate a film that is mean-spirited for the point of being mean-spirited.\n\nTom Six says that his next installment will be the final entry in the saga of The Human Centipede. Hopefully after this we'll get to see some more of Six's true talent behind the camera when he is not busy directing one of the world's most sickest creations. He does have talent with a camera, why would he want to waste it on such effortless, artless, and joyless content? Starring: Laurence R. Harvey, Ashley Yennie, and Vivien Bridson. Directed by: Tom Six."

I only mentioned that because over half of the negative reviews of this film only say that this movie is sick. Lawrence R Harvey played his role so well. So well, you'd think he he'd be like that in real life. This is not a film to watch to see a good plot and character development. You only watch this movie if you like disgusting or gory films or to be shocked. It is definitely one of the nastiest films out there and it is better than films like August Underground's Mordum and Slaughtered Vomit Dolls because it is a well made film. I'd say see it if you are interested in it."

The film progressed in a very Hollywood style, with an easy-to-follow story arc, plot turns along the way, and just enough implied to disturb the audience.\n\nNow, with The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence), Six throws the audience to the far end of the spectrum. HC2 is a dark, twisted and entirely disturbing film of obsession and psychosis. The filming style is extraordinarily gritty and feels more like the video-diary of a deranged psychopath. Every gory and nasty detail is presented in full to the audience, bringing all the implied horrors of the first film to the forefront. There is no clear-cut story arc here, only a driving motivation that the Full Sequence will be realized.\n\nThose seeking the laughs of HC1 will instead be treated to gasps, gags and fright. Six has managed to shock even those who saw HC1 by created an expectation in the first film and completely shattering it. Bravo."

I loved Dieter Laser as the mad scientist, and the film had emotion and suspense. It wasn't just trying to shock (there's actually very little gore in it at all) it was trying to take you on an experience and I felt quite drained afterwards. I do think it's a good film. I do not think that its sequel is a good film. In fact I think it's one of the worst films I've seen and is an insult to us horror hounds and fans of the first film.\n\nOf course I had heard a lot about this film before seeing it. It was the most disturbing film ever and the most twisted, apparently. Why would anyone want to see that? You might ask yourselves, and it's a good question. I was expecting The Human Centipede II to be bad, but I suppose curiosity got the better of me, and as I said, I did really like the first one. To be quite honest with you I don't think it's as disturbing as everyone makes out. The whole film is completely ridiculous and it's quite obvious that Tom Six is trying to shock the audience and in the end it just feels desperate and tedious.\n\nI must admit that I do like the idea of the first film being completely medically accurate and the second film not, even though it is supposedly set in reality. Lawrence R Harvey is also very good as our cuddly hero, Martin. I believed that he was insane and he really does put his all into the role. It's just too bad that the role is incredibly weak. Martin says nothing, instantly making it very difficult for the audience to give one iota about the man. I'm also not keen on the message that most horror fans are all perverted lunatics.\n\nThe majority of the film is incredibly tedious and not very shocking. The first hour is made up of Martin whacking people on the head with a crowbar and taking them to an abandoned warehouse. What I found much more interesting was Martin's background and home life, even if the woman playing his Mum (and every other actor) couldn't act for a toffee apple. However Tom Six completely blows his opportunities to exploit this and is clearly more interested in trying to shock. However, the film only really gets shocking in the last half hour or so which is when Martin starts creating the centipede.\n\nI should point out that I saw the version which the BBFC patronisingly cut, so I was thankfully saved from seeing barbwire and an accelerator pedal. The film gets very nasty towards the end, but it's all done in a rather boring and desperate way. There's only so much stapling and knee-slicing you can see until it becomes tiresome and just plain mean-spirited. Seeing the actual centipede isn't that shocking either because we've seen it all before! The poo scene (which Tom Six calls the highlight) is when the film just tries too hard to be noticed.\n\nThe Human Centipede II is the film equivalent of Jonah from Summer Heights High. It's the obnoxious kid at the back of the class trying to piddle off the teacher. But what happens with all these kids? They just get kicked out the classroom and ignored. Films like this give horror a bad name. Horror isn't about gore and shocking scenes, it's supposed to have a point and a story. The story here is complete tripe and stripped of any entertainment value. It also fails in being the most disturbing film ever. I find Martyrs much more disturbing, but that could also be because Martyrs is a profound and moving experience with a point.\n\nI shall look forward to the third instalment like a fly looks forward to the next swatter.\n\nRead more weird and dazzling reviews at www.asdaman.wordpress.com"

When you get to Human Centipede II, you might start seeing more of an audience of people with twisted minds. There was a genuine morbid curiosity that drew a lot of people to the original (and they got exactly what they wanted). What separates the normal people from the rest of us is the fact that some of us, knowing exactly what to expect, came back to this franchise for a second helping. Picking up with the ending of the first film, this one follows a sick-minded man who, after seeing the Human Centipede film, decides to replicate it in his own life. The resulting product is perhaps even more shocking and revolting than the original because, without access to the medical tools and technologies Dieter Laser's evil doctor did in the predecessor, the results are spotty at best. And there's something just satisfying about seeing black and white excrement come flinging its way toward the camera, and knowing that Tom Six was able to not only get away with shooting it, but with releasing it to the public. What a beautiful accomplishment. This movie is a little more slow-moving than the first one, seeking to try to create a continuity between them and deepening the plot. The mute main character was a little hard to invest in as a viewer and it did take a little bit too long to get to the \"action\" (so to speak), hence the lower rating compared to the original."

I knew of the film and it's reputation and watched it on the basis that i'd really run out of things to watch.\n\nIt's pretty much what I expected, lots of gruesome and very sick scenes and little plot. The first and by far less grisly half was halfway entertaining but the second half was pure 'torture porn' which isn't my thing. As a result I found it pretty hard to get through, in fact it's as close as i've come to ever being sick as a result of a film.\n\nUnfortunately it was hard to care for any of the victims as there was little back story. Due to the subject matter I'm not really sure if it's possible to actually enjoy this film. I certainly didn't enjoy it and won't be watching it again.\n\nFor what it's worth I thought it was decently filmed and was far from the worst film I've ever seen though it's probably the most repulsive. It's main aim seems to be to shock and it didn't really do this for me other than make me feel sick. The situation is too ridiculous for this to be disturbing in the way Irreversible and Martyrs were.\n\nA film to watch for curiosity value only and then only once."

I think it being banned in a few countries was the best way to advertise this film, as otherwise it would be a very quickly forgotten sequel to an awful original film.\n\nIn truth, this is better than the first one, there's actually some sort of storyline, and the mood of the film is very 'clockwork orange' like.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's not a good film, not by a long shot. But it's OK, I like the storyline, of a socially retarded man, who doesn't speak throughout the film, taking revenge on all that do him wrong and putting them in the centipede.\n\nThe actual centipede sequence, although the climax of the film, doesn't last long and is actually not the main focus of the film. THe film is mainly about the main character, and his capturing of his victims.\n\nAnyone interested in watching the centipede films, I'd advise to give the first one a miss and give this one a try. Only if you've got that weird, 'I just want to see what it's like' thought when you see it being advertised"

        "review_detailed_main": "I had the opportunity to see this on its one week tour of Australia, and I was lucky enough to get tickets to the premiere followed by Q+A with Lawrence R. Harvey. Having literally just finished The Human Centipede before leaving to see this I was quite excited to see what Tom Six would do with this sequel (considering I stayed away from any reviews and spoilers). Well, I must say, Six has produced one of the best genre pieces in quite some time. It's a strange little movie, black and white, with a silent villain and an intense final half hour. It is well known that part of this film is Six responded to the negativity from horror fans of the first film, which was berated for not being extreme or sick enough. Now, I didn't LOVE the first film (I gave it a 6/10), but this was for different reasons. I though Six did a fantastic job with The Human Centipede, the direction and setting were fantastic, and the concept was just so screwed up! Where the first one fell short was the writing and acting from the three victims, which seriously detracted from the horror of the movie. With The Human Centipede II I think there has been a big improvement in writing and acting, but more importantly for Six, an increased amount of depravity.\n\nMartin is a parking garage attendant. A loner, with mother issues and who was abused by his father. Already mentally unstable, his fixation with The Human Centipede inspires him to create his own, by knocking people out in the garage, dragging them to an abandoned shed and using kitchen appliances to perform the surgery. The first fifty minutes aren't exactly violent, but still quite good. The scenes in Martin's apartment reek of David Lynch, and are darkly comic. Once Six gets into making the centipede there is a kind of joyfulness about it all that is disturbing, yet still enjoyable. Teeth are knocked out, tendons are cut, flesh is stripped and staple guns are used instead of stitches. The assembly of the centipede isn't the end, and what follows blends very dark humour with some very disturbing imagery.\n\nI won't go into anymore detail, needless to say, the uncut version is MUCH better than the cut version. Having read the descriptions of certain scenes in other versions, let me say, they are FAR worse here! So for those waiting for the uncut version you are in for a pleasant surprise. Lawrence R. Harvey, for a debut performance, is fantastic. He is easily one of the best horror villains to grace our screens in years. Meeting him afterwards was a pleasure, he is an incredibly friendly, well-spoken man. The cinematography is fantastic, the whole film has a dirty, grungy atmosphere.\n\nOn a sad note, the film just got banned in Australia, a disappointing choice by the OFLC. Will this film ever see the light of day in Australia uncensored? Not in the near future. Much like A Serbian Film, an incredible viewing experience has been denied to adults who are able to consent to the films they want to see. I don't want to get into a censorship essay though!\n\n8/10"

I mean, why are we so keen on seeing something we know is going to be vile and disturbing? Why did I personally see all these movies, even though they always fill me with disgust and shame (see also: \"Police Academy\")? I'll probably never get it, but with that said: the second one is clearly the best of this epic trilogy. The first one does virtually nothing with its unique premise, the third one is essentially one long in-joke...but this one actually seems close to what director Tom Six was trying to do all along: entertaining an audience through nausea. This is mainly because of new lead Lawrence Harvey, who genuinely puts in a great performance and is just incredibly unpleasant to look at. Dieter Laser looked creepy as well in the first one, but he performed like he could barely remember his lines (which makes sense, because the man barely speaks English). Harvey doesn't have any lines, so that's an improvement I guess. Martin is actually a compelling character, which I thought was far beyond Six' capabilities. If you have to watch a \"Human Centipede\"-entry make it this one, because the franchise won't get any better than this. Which is kind of depressing, but that's the effect these movies have."

I take little solace in the fact that I did not actually pay to rent it--I can thank a friend for that--because I still feel as though I have participated in something so awful, so nihilistic and vile, that I fear for humanity itself. I am not here to pass moral judgment. I do not blame the director, Tom Six, for making the film any more than I blame myself for viewing the film he made. Does the film classify as obscenity? Does it contain any value, any artistic merit? Perhaps, in that it has affected me deeply enough to compel me write a review--or rather, a warning--something I rarely do. I feel the need to cleanse my soul, as though warning others will somehow provide me with some form of ethical catharsis. Regardless of what I write, however, I still feel hollow inside, knowing that this film was created with great deliberation and forethought by thinking, breathing human beings--people who chose to participate in its creation just as I chose to watch it."

This parking lot attendant has a firearm, all the videos are on closed circuit which goes right to the company and monitored by the UK gov.\n\nThe main character alone is physically incapable of what he was doing anyway. Honestly. There is no way physically he could have performed 80% of what he did.\n\nAlso, the worst part and why I hate Tom Six for all of his self indulgence, he didn't even come up with a new storyline. Its all a rehash. Its an homage to his original. What kind of unimaginative garbage is that.\n\nThis is just a waste of time to be perfectly honest. It is not any more grotesque than the original and IMO just simply unimaginative.\n\nLong story short, Tom Six has an ego the size of Kim Jong Ill and a lot less entertaining."

Tom six has done his Horribe Job again bringing this full sequence to all hard core horror lovers. With the mentally challenged obese guy, Martin, this film reveals the new dimension of Human Centipede Movie. Some people out there shouting that this film is SICK. But i don't think so. A film is a film. As a sci-fi horror film, this film is excellent in graphic violence scenes. I'll not comment on Sandpaper and Barbed wire issues as i've seen a semi cut version of this film. Finally it's up to the viewers, whether they watch this EXTREME HORROR FILM or not."

I personally like it more than the other two films of the trilogy, it seems grittier and darker, in part due to being shot in black and white. The acting for this type of film is actually not bad, better than what I expected it to be. Now what I don't understand are all the negative reviews about this film, mainly accusing it of being extremely gory, violent, disgusting, etc. It seems as if the people who wrote such reviews thought they were going to watch another sequel to Lion King or something... The title alone should be a good indicator, along with the trailer (!) I mean, if you hate gory violent films, then watched the trailer for this film and still decided to go see it, you must have been either drunk or are a masochist. It's like a vegan who goes to a steakhouse and then writes a bad review about it because they eat meat there - what a surprise, right?... But for those who like horror and don't find this sort of material offensive, this is an entertaining, grotesque movie with lots of dark humor. I gave it 7 stars since it's not a great film really but, for what it is, it's fun and, very importantly, not pretentious, like so many horror films nowadays with directors who take themselves way too seriously."

But one then has to ask: \"Why?\" If I wanted to cause myself pain, I guess putting my cahones on the table and smashing them with a hammer works, but doing so is equally as nonsensical. Folks who wilingly would go to watch this seriously need to go have their heads checked. The only thing more disgusting than this flick would be to be forced to watch Nazi instructional videos on how to torture small toddlers-- both items that sane people should avoid. I love a gory movie at times, as long as there is some point or preconceived destination of where the movie is supposed to go. One has to wonder if the main character, is actually Tom Six?"

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm angry. I'm downright mad. I've come to the conclusion that after watching The Human Centipede II, a small piece of my humanity has died needlessly. By willingly sitting through this cacophony of feces and screams I have tacitly permitted director Tom Six to befoul my soul. I now expect to exhibit symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Thank you Mr Six for the 88 minutes it took you to dehumanize me.\n\nSimply put, this entire project is a superfluous exercise in violence with no redeeming artistic or social value at all. This was not a movie. It was a molestation. It was a quick cash-in on the popularity of Human Centipede I. I saw the first HC wondering if this one would have been any better. It was not. It would have been immeasurably easier on my humanity to have watched something more light-hearted. Sitting through a cooking show hosted by Ed Gein or watching a documentary on how to treat Perirectal Itch would have held more charm than sitting through Human Centipede II\n\nThere's no detailed plot development or back-story. It is devoid of any real dialog with very little genuine character development at all. There is no noteworthy music or soundtrack. There is only one thing. Violence. Six has dehumanized the cast, reducing them to meat with grotesque levels of violence. I found it difficult to display any empathy either for the picked-on, pudgy, mentally challenged, miscreant Martin or any of his hapless victims. I simply found myself not caring at all. I was too busy cringing and reaching for the sick bag.\n\nThe fact that Six believes filming this salad tossing 'Anal Fantasia' in black and white (and brown, apparently) gives it some sort of art school legitimacy or the feel of a bona fide horror movie is wrong. Black and white does mute the levels of gore. The gore would have been ramped WAY up had he released this movie in color. Ach, watching color footage of Mr Six drowning a litter of kittens in a bucket of his own urine would have been easier to sit through. Perhaps in his next movie?\n\nA word to anyone who might be thinking about choosing the theater as a career. Sit through this uncomfortable, festering boil of a movie. Notice what these actors had to do for their craft. Imagine telling your friends I found work, a movie roll! And it turns out you're credited as victim number 5 after spending countless weeks naked with your face duck taped to some other out of work actor's arse! Do these guys even get a break for lunch? When filming such stink-bomb subject matter, I'm not sure whether that would be a blessing or a curse. I applaud their professionalism for having had put up with such on screen directorial degeneracy . The only question remaining: Will Ashlynn Yennie get her salad tossed yet again for the cameras in some future Human Centipede III?\n\nI don't know and don't care. I've already sat through TWO servings of Tom Six. You'll need a guy like Martin to shove a funnel down my throat if you want me to digest any more sick from Tommy Six"

At first glance I thought I would see some cinematographic development throughout the movie along with some great casting but this movie failed both in cinematographic and casting aspect. There is no logical explanation about why the deranged, unhinged Martin want to implement the same sick idea of creating a human centipede given in the first movie he had his aspirations from. Film's black and white photography makes his actions even sicker than the sickest can think of. He is a sick and abused and totally secluded from the society due to his years of child abuse conducted by his own father and his mom's restless accusations of his sending his dad to the jail. None of these really make a person emulate what was done in a sick movie. When I watched the first movie I did not really feel that disgusted but the second one tore my appetite for scary movies upside down cause of the disgust and implacability, nastiness and remorselessness of the main character who wants to appease his sick cravings by torturing people. There are hundreds of plot holes and none of these holes really cover the ugliness of this movie. I felt like i was eating in the landfill due to starvation throughout this movie. It is drawn out around a sick minded screenplay which gives nothing but disgust in the end. I loathed this movie from the beginning to the end. I watched it to the end just to see some clemency in the end . If there are still some people who like this kind of sick movies no brainer the need for more shrinks."

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw the original Human Centipede (please don't ask me why). It was okay, for a slightly weird and depraved horror movie. So I guess I felt compelled to watch the sequel.\n\nIt's a sequel in the same way the Blair Witch Project 2 is a sequel to the first. The Human Centipede 2 starts off showing that the first part was a film and focuses on the creepiest man in London, aka Martin, obsessing about it and wanting to re-enact it.\n\nThe film's first half is like a London-based version of David Lynch's Eraserhead - full of weird (and horrible) characters all shot in black and white (I don't know why the film is shot in black and white, but it is). The second half gives you what you came for - assuming you came for the gore and general distaste.\n\nNow, I'm well aware that horror is meant to scare/disgust/disturb etc, so I don't normally mention the acting ability, but, during those rare moments of dialogue (and there aren't many - it could practically be a silent film) the actors really are pretty bad. Perhaps it's best that they spend most of their time screaming? What's it like? It's hard to say. If you want to be disturbed, the film succeeds. However, if you want a story - forget it. The third act is pretty hard to watch and I found myself looking away a couple of times (but then I did have a knee operation myself - you'll have to watch the film to understand).\n\nFair play to the filmmakers for finding the creepiest leading man in the world and putting him in the sickest film, but don't expect much of a plot. There are numerous plot holes that don't make much sense or aren't too realistic. I hear the censors made the filmmakers make 32 cuts - perhaps that would explain why a few things don't add up? I'm not off to watch something nice and cuddly like a Disney movie to remind me there's more to life than slicing people apart and stapling them to each other."

Human Centipede II fared much worse. If there was anything I slightly preferred, it was marginally grittier than the first which I kind of liked. However, the concept is nowhere near as the original, and not only does it have the same mistakes as the original but it makes more along the way. It still has the stock characters, the bad, cheesy dialogue, the dull acting and the medical errors the original had. I had no problem that this film was perhaps more disturbing than the first, the problem was there is no subtlety to it and it is low on the suspense meter. The amplified flaws come from two primary things. I do have to agree that the ending is one of the most rushed endings recently in any film. The other is the villain, in the original the villain did have many moments where he was genuinely chilling, this villain is so cartoony and over-the-top it is hard to feel any pity or such for him. All in all, although I was not a fan of the first movie, the awfulness of this film actually made me appreciate it. 1/10 Bethany Cox"

It seems that the sole intention of the film was to just make it as sickening as possible (to which it succeeded). However, I felt that the storyline was appalling. Some parts, just seemed rushed and very unbelievable. Whilst this is supposed to be a fictional film, as a horror fan, I like to be held in the suspension of disbelief. But this film constantly had me sitting back and thinking \"That clearly wouldn't happen\", when I should have been lost in the plot like I was in the first film.\n\nIts clear that they were, very much, scraping the bottom of the barrel with regards to hiring actors. For the majority of the cast, this was probably their first 'big-time' production and this really did show. It's clear that they had trouble casting this film and I am not surprised. Most respectable actors would have taken one look at the script and torn it up.\n\nI found the acting from most performers to be very 'dry'. The only actors which were decent were the main character 'Martin' (this was mostly because of the fact that his appearance made it impossible for him to be unbelievable as a psycho) and his mother, who did a good job of selling herself as an abusive, crazy old lady.\n\nI think the director should take a long look at this film and then a long look at himself and realise that, if he wants to be regarded as a credible film-maker, he SERIOUSLY needs to up his game. If his sole intention for this film was to make it as sick as possible, then he has done well. However, if he also wanted to make it a scary film with an exciting storyline, then he has failed miserably.\n\nI hope for the next film that he puts as much time and effort into the storyline as he does for the on-screen 'sickness'.\n\nAs for now? I want my \u00a38 back for the DVD."

For this reason, as a horror movie, I think more highly of it.\n\nThe movie is shot in black and white, due to the \"grittier\" feel Six was looking for. In my opinion this could have been done equally as well if the movie had been shot in colour. The lack of colour made the movie hard to concentrate on and I occasionally found myself becoming bored with looking at a very bland screen.\n\nThe audio in the movie is brilliant. One particular scene made me gag, not because of what happened on screen, but the noise which accompanied said scene. I feel that the dialogue in the movie came second to the sounds, a lot of which were cringe-inducing.\n\nThe acting was fairly average, not having the same spark as the original, however this is generally the case in this type of movie and can be overlooked.\n\nOverall the movie was a good horror, utilising some good cinematic devices.

        "review_detailed_main": "Martin, a sexually abused, repressed and perverted grotesque, works at a parking lot, where he touches himself to the original \"Human Centipede\" film. Eventually, he decides to build his own centipede, albeit with lesser surgical skills than part I's Nazi doctor. Hilarity ensues.\n\nOr not.\n\nMade in \"arty\" black in white, this very meta little piece of cinematic nastiness is actually, visually speaking, a vast improvement over the trashy party I. It's hard to appreciate that at times, given what an inane hand Tom Six is at either writing a scene or directing actors, and the result is what Eraserhead might be if written and run by complete amateurs. Common Lynchian themes of sexual distress and physical deformity are used rather clumsily here with no nerve or ability to create sustained tension, so every stalking scene has to end with Martin clubbing his victims with a wrench. You'd think after a few hits it would numb the pain of what is to follow. In any case, the audience isn't so lucky.\n\nOn seeing the trailer you might think this makes for risqu\u00e9, or shocking material. The only shocking thing about this whole sorry exercise is how few ideas you could come up with about a sequel would actually make for a worse film than this.\n\nLike all poor \"horror\" films, HCII resorts to gross comedy or shock value (including what really wants to be the mother of all disgusting birth scenes) because it lacks the courage of its own convictions. If Six had put some humanity in Martin (Laurence R. Harvey, the film's one redeeming feature), even dared to make him a hero, then we'd have something worthwhile on our hands. Instead, we get a half-naked Humpty-Dumpty clubbing unlikable characters - who could easily have escaped - and the answer to what would happened if someone wanted to say, \"do\" the centipede, or if the centipede got a bad case of spray diarrhea...\n\nNext time, just withdraw the budget as cash and set it on fire. That would be less of a waste."

It got to the point where I felt so jaded and bored to what I was watching that it just felt like I was watching lots and lots of muddled splotches being smeared all over the camera like a finger painting. I couldn't even really consider it \"sickening\" because it was so illogical and disconnected from any sort of probability that it almost became comical."

Having NOT seen the first, I knew it wouldn't have much relevance to the second. The plot is obvious people, a complete disgusting and utterly messed up person captures people and tries to turn them in to a \"human centipede\". There is not much depth to that plot. This movie is solely meant to scare the living hell out of people and literally shock them. And for me, it did all of that. I pride myself on loving horror movies, the gore, the torture, the blood, the guts...this movie messed me up in the head so bad. I literally almost threw up 2-3 times, and had to leave my family room twice and almost gave up. I was lucky I got to rent this on demand early IFC movies (even tho it cost my mom 7.99 for this DISGUSTING MOVIE! Sorry mom) So this movie has it all, it is unbelievable the way it made me physically and mentally feel. I swear, I have never had so much anxiety. And I promised myself I would give up thinking about this movie, but here I am 3 days later on IMDb writing a review. Honestly, I begged my friends not to make us all watch this movie, and I'm doing the same to you. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE, unless you're a straight up man with big balls. This movie is insane and Tom Six must have gotten Sandusky'd as a young kid."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I first saw \"The Human Centipede I\" I was skeptical about how the movie would play out, you can never tell with small budget foreign horror movies. But I will say that most foreign horror movies are by far better than their American counter-parts. A majority of American Horror films still center around the \"slasher style\" theme.\n\nI did enjoy the the first Human Centiped and loved the medical and psychological aspects it was built around. It was original in my opinion. The film wasn't too gory or even that vulgar, but it was the idea and concept that made it so good to me.\n\nNow \"The Human Centipede II\" was a total surprise to me as far as sequels go. No Dr. returning from the dead, no secret assistant to carry on his plans, and no survivors taking up the experiment. Instead what you get is a brutal, gory film centered around an extremely mentally disturbed character.\n\nI've seen a lot of reviews criticizing the \"lack of character development\" and thats just BS. If anyone has ever studied film and/or Psychology in school then you can relate to the main character's personality. His character development is centered around childhood abuse from his father which leads to his current state of mental health. If you've studied psychology, psychoanalytical theory, conditioning, then you know what I mean. In a sense you almost feel sorry or sympathize with the main character and this was developed beautifully without any \"real\" dialogue from the main character.\n\nWhat I will say is that \"The Human Centipede II\" was a hell of a lot more gory than the original and very disturbing in some of the scenes, especially the uncut version. This film is by far not a master piece, but I thought the concept and the way the film was shot worked very well.\n\nSo I would suggest that you give this film a shot and form your own opinion about it. If you're a blood and guts freak then you'll like it for that reason, if you're looking for something that could very well happen; meaning the obsession with a film and the act to carry out what was observed, then you'll like it for that reason. Or you'll just plain hate it. Anyways give it a watch and then think about what you just saw. I might also suggest having something a little \"happy\" or something to brighten up the mood after watching this."

As the man begins to mock the officers small stature, the little guy shoots him in the foot and proceeds to beat the couple unconscious with a crow bar. The portly masochist then duct tapes the love birds and loads them into a van. They are taken to a warehouse where others are held captive.\n\nBack at home, the nut case stares at pictures in a scrapbook of scenes from the first Human Centipede. He also has a glass case with the actual insects living the good life. A Freud like doctor is called to the house by his roommate and mother to treat her crazy son.\n\nThe rotund sicko abducts more victims and lines them up in a row. The love-hate relationship with his mom continues until she ends up sitting in a chair, lifeless like Norman Bates mother in Psycho. His analyst is next in line to bite the dust.\n\nAnd now it's time for some amateur surgery, sans anesthetic; can you say ouch!

There you have it; The Human Centipede 2 and an extremely demented director; but it does have a funny ending, though."

        "review_detailed_main": "The first movie of these \"The Human Centipede\" films was adequate, not great, but it was watchable. Part two, well it is a step back.\n\nSure I will give it that it is more bizarre, extreme, gritty and messed up than the first movie was. But where as the first part was actually driven by a story, part two is just driven by a compulsion to be as extreme as possible and to surpass the previous movie in bizarreness.\n\n\"The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)\" is about Martin, a disturbed man who is obsessed about the movie \"The Human Centipede\", and wants to create one himself, nay, better yet, outdo the work of doctor Heiter in the movie and make a twelve-person centipede. It requires some heinous work, but Martin is so far beyond sanity that it is not a matter of if he gets the victim, but a mere matter of how.\n\nRight, well there is something that resembles a storyline, however it was drowned out in the outrageous attempt to be as sickening, perverted and twisted as possible - in the terms of what was shown on the screen. And that was a shame, because a better storyline would really have helped the movie better along. Everything in this movie was basically seen in part one, it was just taken a couple of steps further beyond what was seen in part one.\n\nAnd one thing I don't personally understand is why Tom Six opted to shoot the movie in Black & White. It just doesn't make sense. He said the movie would be much scarier in black and white. Hardly so. There were so many gory and ghastly details that were lost in the lack of color. Had the movie been in color, then the impact from the bizarre and disturbing scenes in the movie would have been that much more impressive.\n\nI will say that actor Laurence R. Harvey (playing Martin) really did an excellent job in portraying this depraved and psychotic character.\n\nEntertainmentwise, then \"The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)\" was a step back compared to the first movie. But if you enjoy bizarre and ghastly things (and can stand the lack of color), then \"The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)\" might just be what you are seeking."

While I rather enjoy all of those, this movie took the worst of each of them. The movie watched like a bunch of scenes stuck together, had absolutely no character development, and I really could not take it seriously as horror or gore. Many times while watching this I actually thought it was a comedy due to the cheesy acting and plot.\n\nThe concepts of the gore weren't too terrible but it was very unrealistic and far too drawn out and slow. Philosophy of the Knife did this in a way as to make it more disturbing and grotesque, but Centipede 2 somehow made it more comical in most cases. The black and white added nothing and I can only imagine it was done to cheap out on special effects.\n\nAs a huge horror/gore fan I am saddened that this is one of the most mainstream of the genre. Maybe it's just my opinion but gore is not enough to make a movie in and of itself. A Serbian Film and Antichrist prove that a gory movie can also be a great movie. The Human Centipede 2 on the other hand is exactly what keeps these sorts of films on the B list."

The acting was awful, I can only assume the casting director had to scrape the barrel to find people actually willing to be seen in it and the only saving grace was that most of the \"actors\" were unable to actually speak through most of the film. Unlike the first film which did build tension at times, this was just basically a load of head bashing and fake blood. The writer tried to put a back story to the main character but, to be perfectly honest, the acting was so bad that I didn't care. I can kind of see why the first one could become a cult film but they should have left it there.

At least they have some redeeming plot devices as opposed to a moron like Tom Six that I wouldn't let lick my dogs arse for money. Wow can you believe that a producer and a studio actually paid for this guy to make such drivel? Makes the Saw franchise appear as eloquent as any Shakespeare production..

And if you've seen hostel, you'd know what I mean. Everything in the movie just makes you wanna cringe. They wanted to make this movie as gross as possible, and they accomplished it.\n\nThe story itself is mediocre. It's a about an overweight, mentally challenged man living in his moms house. And she's blaming him for her husband going to prison. He works in this parking garage in which he kills most of his victims. It's a pretty serene environment is why. He's obsessed with the very fist Human Centipede movie, and his goal is to create a Human centipede in which he captures 12 people and brutally tortures them. I've never seen the first one, but I tell you it's way worse.\n\nAll in all, the story is pretty interesting, but there's really no value whatsoever. It's kind of scary but more disturbing than anything. This is not a film for really young kids I tell you that."

Hopefully they were paid well enough to go back to school to find another career, because I'm sure being in this killed any chance they had to be taken seriously in Hollywood. Can you imagine Brad Pitt or Sandra Bullock in something like this, even at the beginning of their career when they were unknown?!! I can't believe this crap is on Netflix. ( or maybe I can) It really should not be so easily accessible for young viewers. It's disturbing to think that this trash can infiltrated & soil the purity of young, developing minds.

So it's a movie within a movie. This time around though it lacks tension and isn't really a scary movie, gross yes but it lacks the scare factor. There really isn't a story in this, basically a mentally handicapped,deluded guy that is messed up in the head and works at a parking garage that is obsessed with the movie \"The Human Centipede\". And wants to complete what the villain in the first movie experimented with. I don't know if it's trying to send a message of how some idiots reenact parts in movies that cause people harm. Or something but my guess is, Six tried to shock the audience with the gratuitous and gross factor.

        "review_detailed_main": "'THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE II (FULL SEQUENCE)': Zero Stars (Out of Five)\n\nNotorious B filmmaker Tom Six's sequel to his notorious cult classic 'THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE (FIRST SEQUENCE)'. I was appalled at the original film and I am appalled at this sequel just the same. I love horror films, I really admire the effect they have on the viewer and (usually) their creativeness. This film definitely has an effect on the viewer and is arguably creative, to a certain extent, but lacks any inspiration or quality purpose whatsoever. It's only goal is to torture the viewer and if that's what you're looking for than this may be the movie for you but I can't give it any credit for that.\n\nThis second installment treats the original film as just a movie and revolves around an obsessed fan of it. Laurence R. Harvey stars as Martin Lomax, a 'man child' who still lives with his mother (Vivien Bridson) and works at a parking garage where he spends a lot of his time watching the original film over and over again. Martin was sexually abused by his father and is now verbally abused by his mother and that's all the reason were given for Martin's sick and demented ways. We watch in terror as Martin begins making his fantasy of imitating his favorite film a reality (this time involving a twelve person centipede).\n\nThe movie is about as painful and sickening a film-going experience as I've ever had and was honestly, arguably one of the worst experiences of my life. So if you enjoy life and are not a sadomasochist I'd recommend staying away from this film. Of course if that sounds more like a recommendation than a deterrent than this might be the movie for you. I'm sure there are plenty of people out there that will love it. Writer/director Tom Six obviously has some talent and originality he just hasn't found a good way to show it yet, I hope some day he does.\n\nWatch our review show 'Movie Talk' at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhQaTxuL7SQ"

Thankfully the film has been converted into black and white so that the gruesome stuff isn't too gruesome, but it's the ideas and the gross surrealism that makes this so sickening.\n\nAlthough this is a US-financed film, it was shot in England with some terrible actors, not least the lead. But there's no semblance of a script, Tom Six instead just goes out of his way to offend with one bad taste or explicit scene after another. The ending is particularly repulsive, but incredibly a third part of the trilogy still follows."

There is enough mayhem to go around. And depending on what version you bought, you might even be able to see it in full color. Whether that is something you want to seek is up to you.

        "review_detailed_main": "After being obsessed with the film The Human Centipede, Martin, a man who was sexual abused as a boy, decides to make his own human centipede, twelve people long.\n\nI saw the first film with a friend at the After Dark film festival simply because there was so much hype and the concept had me laughing with excitement at the ridiculousness of it all. I was a tad let down by it because it didn't push the boundaries as much as it claimed too. So it appears that Tom Six, the writer and director, has heard the complaints about the first film and decided to go all out with his sequel. This film is more twisted, sick and perverse than his original, so reader beware.\n\nHuman Centipede 2: Full Sequence takes liberties with the storyline of the original, it openly admit that the first film is, well, a movie. This takes away some of the fun. That might have been Six's intention though, as he also takes away a lot of the comedic elements that the first film had and instead, makes the film more gritty, dirty and depressing. There is no hope in this flick and it ranks as one of the nastiest films I've seen. Take what you expected and hoped the first film would be in terms of grossness and multiply that by ten here.\n\nBeing in black and white adds a bit of dirtiness to the film and it was a good decision on the director's part to do this as it might not have worked as well in colour. There were a few scenes that had me closing my eyes in shock and disgust. At times it feels like it's tying too hard to push the envelope, but never falls into the area that \"A Serbian Film\" did, even though both films deal with infant endangerment.\n\nThe lead actor is really good in his role as the mentally ill Martin, and he never speaks a word. He plays the role of deviant very well and makes you wish to never run into someone as sick as he is. His obsession with the film leads him to make his own version of the human centipede, leaving the medical aspect back home and making it a more \"do it yourself\" version, using a staple gun. There is no plot here, it's simple a sick individual kidnapping people and performing this act. The last act of the film is him actually making this sick twisted fantasy happen, this is where the majority of the disturbing content happens.\n\nTo explain the film anymore would rob those wanting to experience the crudeness of it. To sum up my experience I would have to say that despite the first film being a disappointment, I had more fun watching it than I did with this one. The sequel out squirms it by miles and if you're looking for something sick and twisted, check this out. It's a one time only \"watch it\" experience and those wanting to see it, should already know what to expect."

        "review_detailed_main": "Firstly, I feel somewhat ashamed to say that I actually watched this the whole way through, but I, like many others, felt I needed to see what all the fuss was about.\n\nIt wasn't about much. The film has no point to it in the way of content. Sure, it's a gross concept (and I have no idea how they got the budget to do it - how would you propose this to potential investors??) but in more of a toe-curl and grimace kind of way rather than a permanently disturbing, vomit-worthy kind of way. Although I have not seen 'A Serbian Film', my partner assures me that 'Human Centipede 2' doesn't even come close to matching it in both storyline and shock value.\n\nThe film also has multiple plot errors such as the fact that a security guard in Britain would not be allowed to carry arms. Also, Martin would have been found out way before all of this due to the fact that he would have to have been sharing his shifts, meaning someone else would have noticed either the blood stains on the wall or the fact that he was a really sick bastard.\n\nThe acting throughout the film is pretty terrible, excluding Laurence R. Harvey who played the part of mentally ill sadist Martin particularly well. The victims however weren't great, but then again, you wouldn't expect commendable actors to appear in such a film.\n\nThe reason I have given the film two stars is because of the cinematography, which is interesting and without which would have left the film unworthy being called anything other than 'hardcore torture pornography'.\n\nAlso, I am thankful to Tom Six for releasing this in black and white. I feel that it helped to take the edge off the gore which was, as I understand, his aim. Plus, it was one of the best black and white films I've seen due to the use of contrast.\n\nOther than that, there really is nothing appealing about this film, and I found the ending particularly disappointing. It just seemed as though Six added it as a last effort to give this dull and twisted film a point or to leave the yawning, slightly ill-feeling audience with something to think about."

        "review_detailed_main": "STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning\n\nIn a post modern twist on the first film, Martin (Laurence R. Harvey) is a mentally disturbed loner who works as a late night car park attendant and watches a down loaded version of the original Human Centipede film on his lap top. With memories of his sexually abusive father swirling around in his mind, and loathed by his mother, he sees no motivation in his life greater than to try to attempt and copy his hero Dr. Leiter's idea in the first HC film, only this time try and fix twelve people together as opposed to Heiter's three. And so he rents an abandoned warehouse and sets about gathering victims for his diabolical plan.\n\nNothing like a film designed just to shock. And nothing like the great publicity such a film gets when the people in charge of awarding it a classification decide it's too unpleasant to be released and try and ban it. And so such a film will get the wind knocked out of it's sails a little when it only gets released after thirty two cuts are made to it, especially when the result is something as apathetic and none eventful as this. And when that film appears to get released straight to DVD. Sure, there's the odd moment that will make the stomach spin a bit, but mostly this is a story without any sting in it's tail. And there sure ain't anything else to raise it above the bar.\n\nProbably the only thing that gives the film any credos is the performance, or rather the appearance of the central character. Martin is revolting to look at, feels revolting to be around and certainly has revolting thoughts going around in his head, a grossly overweight, bug eyed, bespectacled pervert who never speaks and has an alarming lack of manners and self regard. The murky, rain sodden world he inhabits further dampens his presence and adds to the mood and atmosphere around him. But beneath the surface, there's nothing to lift the film above the superficial, just a bleak, voyeuristic, seedy and thoroughly unpleasant piece of exploitation cinema that just goes to show how much publicity cheap shock can get you, and how you can even get let down if that's what you wanted to watch it for. *"

Watch the last 5 mins, then the 5 mins before, then previous 5.. etc. That's the best way to dissect the film. Watch the result then see how the film got there.\n\nIt wasn't done anywhere as well as the original which had a truly gruesome ending and certainly qualified to sit in the \"horror\" category.\n\nHC#2 is a joke - one big joke. It's purpose is to set a new bottom rung on the ladder, which it has aptly done. It was designed to inflame the censors and thus self promote, which it has also done excellently. No doubt the term \"Human Centipede\" will enter the vernacular of most work places now along with most houses of parliament or political parties, members of which no doubt will be able to resonate with the term \"brown nosing\".\n\nHa, Ha, Ha.

His appearance, distant sinister gaze, and his demeanor shine through the grittiness of the film. Talking about gritty, this guy masturbates with sandpaper. Now that's gritty.\n\nReally, the movie is shot from his introspective. His deranged and abusive upbringing, turning him into a brutal unsuspecting killer. He seems harmless enough, like the the \"Have you seen my stapler guy?\" from Office Space. Yet, this is one parking attendants garage you definitely don't want to park in.\n\nThe film is much better than the first one. Shot in black and white, and filmed great cinematography wise. It remains raw, grainy, and uncut. Audio is distant, but well suiting for such somber setting. This movie is dark, unrelenting, and leaves absolutely not one hint of remorse or emotion. Tom Six has put together something of genius and epic proportions, 12 to exact."

But I'm not praising it.\n\nThe story was shoe-horned into reality, there were waaay to many plot holes (& I'm not one to judge generally) but I found myself constantly questioning the events taking place in the movie. The dialogue was short, but when there was dialogue it was either delivered badly or it itself was bad (The acting of the one of the first victims nearly made me stop watching). I also didn't think the black & white made any difference to the setting, I read it was to make it scarier, I think that's a stupid reason, make it B&W because it'll be dark.\n\nThe positives are pacing, there is a small side story dealing with his problems interwoven in between the abductions, which stops the first half from dragging, & the effects are very realistic. it has some character development but its not worth mentioning, just a bit of fleshing out of the main character, but more than the first did.\n\nTo finish, I don't recommend any one to see this movie, the scenes are horrific; literally to the extreme, with no entertainment value of any kind, & the rest of the movie doesn't balance or improve it.

Of course, cashing in on the success this sequel, shot in black and white, that does give it more interesting and hungry appeal, for lovers of the first one, could be one imaginative sick fantasy of a forties loner, Martin (Lawrence Harvey) a car parking attendant, who still lives with his mommy. Also a fan of the first, our repulsive loner, (just check out the cover) has built his own scenario that includes 12 unfortunates, where he masquerades as a fake assistant to the director of a film that was never meant to be. Have a guess who the director is? This will score a couple of laughs. He hires out one of the actresses from the first Centipede film, but it's a whole different scene when she arrives, as she unwittingly becomes another victim, part of the twelve person chain, this centipede, coming apart, which has you of course knowing why this s 100 percent inaccurate. I did like this scenario, that can't compensate one iota, for the trashiness of this movie. This time around, Six has really let loose in the violence department. The most graphic scene is the bashing of the mother, until her head is reduced but skull and gross yucky matter. I picked out the thirty second cut scene, much earlier in the film, the films first violent scene I think, involving the real estate agent, who's knifed standing up, but is suddenly flat on the ground, with the psychopathic Martin, (a terrible Harvey, a rank amateur up, against he wonderful Laser from the last Centipede) hovering over her. This is a much guiltier pleasure for Centipede lovers, where again, the script hasn't had much thought to it, where it seems this movie was made faster than the first, if just after completion of it's predecessor, in a rush to get this one out. But being base, which this film is, one can take enjoyment from it's rank standard, and it's offering of ugliness and violence. Even Martin's psychiatrist, is a scummy ill bred sort, if stereotypical of the movie, it's total disregard for being truly offensive to one's humanity, unlike the first, to a much smaller extent, where ranked up against the first Centipede, that predecessor seems many a far stretch, as being a fine feature film, when matched against this dreck. And too, this one is bound to make a few Centipede fans angry."

        "review_detailed_main": "Yes, this film may be stupid, sick, and make even the toughest people want to throw up, and the graphic content alone is a good enough reason for a 4.2 rating, but I can't say I didn't enjoy it at all.\n\nI had incredibly low expectations too. But once I began watching it, hoping for a laugh, a cheap gross-out, I became somewhat interested. The fact that it was in black-and-white was a very good factor indeed; if it had been in colour, it would have lost its effect. But the colourless, consistently dark atmosphere gave this film a much more compelling effect. And the fact that the central character never speaks, or never has to speak, is another interesting feature. I think that one small subtlety topples most of the lack of subtleties in this film.\n\nI did watch the cut version, and, though I will never say this about most cut films, I would recommend it more. The violence is dumbly graphic and disgusting, but what more do you expect? That was the sole reason this film was made: to be disgustingly awful. Yes, it does lack any kind of meaning or moral, and the violence is all blatant, full on-screen trying to make you uneasy, but that's the point, and for a cheesy gross-out b-movie video nasty, I think they did a half-decent job.\n\nAppalling acting and dialogue, and terribly disgusting (I VERY highly recommend the cut version), but it's interesting, well-paced, disturbing and sticks with you. We get a bit of an emotional bond with the highly disgusting protagonist, which is the beauty of it: the filmmakers have got us on the side of a sexually disturbed maniac.\n\n7/10 - not a bad job, certainly for its expectations."

BUT they just lay there sobbing and acting dumb. unreal. fake. seemed like b class 'acting'. other then that it was repeated concept with more gore. it could be better. and yes: when martin stapled there lips to anus. again easy to take all staples out of flesh as they couldn't get bent locked from under as per the stapling mechanics goes. The ruthless goon was so babied that he even couldn't punch or even grab martin the idiot. the painful noises of victims and there struggle was pathetically unreal and epically shitty. :)"

Peter Jackson was a rough equivalent of his time; a master of the darkly humoured shock horror genre who eventually worked his way into the mainstream and has since produced (some) exceptional material. I think Tom Six is potentially a better director than Jackson if he can live in the mainstream (or if the mainstream can live with him)."

Yes, it has some gross parts, but for all the reviewers screaming about how revolting it is, chill out. If you're a horror fan you're going to see many more disgusting films than this in your time. Granted, if you're looking for a chick-flick, it might be more grim than usual. Or depending on your point of view, possibly not.\n\nIt's The Human Centipede, and if you're going into the 2nd installment of a film like this, you know exactly what you're in for and exactly what the main gist is. I found this one to be a lot better than the first - in pacing, storyline, acting, just about everything was better. It was darker than the first, and really tried to give more of an insight into the antagonist. Being shot fully in black and white was a great touch, it made it a little different and really added to the bleakness.\n\nThere were some glaringly obvious logical errors here and there, and it is by no means one of the best films ever made, but it was decent and a vast improvement on its predecessor."

        "review_detailed_main": "People watch films like this mostly due to curiosity. In this sequel, curiosity tried to kill the cat again, but this time the cat was unimpressed.\n\nWhat made the first film so thought provoking was the fact that someone could actually do such actions in the real world - perverse surgery on unwilling victims. The worrying thought of being put in that situation yourself is terrifying. The actors of the victims did a terrific job acting in a way that I imagine one would. I believe it is a true representation of horror, being that there are no ghosts or zombies or any other nonsense that would otherwise remind you that it's a fantasy. The film is none other than a horrifying and believable situation and is targeted mainly for the curious minded.\n\nWhen I heard that there was to be a sequel, I sighed. Sequels usually are by definition the same idea as the first but on a larger scale - more of the same content but no inventive ideology. Well guess what? This is no different in that respect. This is different however in believability. The realistic aspect of the first stood strong, but a few of the events in this sequel leaves you to say to yourself \"That wouldn't happen in real life.\" It's a ruiner.\n\nThe main character of this film, Martin, a multi-storage car park attendant, is obsessed and inspired by the first film and wishes to imitate it on a larger scale. A huge portion of the screen time is taken up with the collecting of the victims, apparently over a couple of days whereby he simply just walks up to people and shoots them and/or hits them with a crow bar, then drives them to a building and drops them off. The fact that there's no one else around who can hear these gun shots, notice veered off cars with bullet holes in them, notice the blood on the floor, report missing persons to the police is nothing short of a miracle. It wouldn't take the police long to visit the last known locations of these victims and review the security tapes, but apparently this is all ignored.\n\nThe reminders of fantasy doesn't stop there, the entire playback is in black and white, apparently to make it feel more scary (this fails). The main character being a mute, traumatised weird looking man who is seen and analysed by a perverse doctor who has secret sexual desires for him, is all rather far fetched and bordering on silly.\n\nThe unrealistic nature of these aspects ruined this film for me. For it now to be unbelievable in my mind makes me totally un-phased by the portrayed horror. It's hard to feel sorry for most of the victims too, as they are characterised as generally nasty people anyway.\n\nAs you may have guessed by now, I wasn't impressed. If you're a fan of sick films then this may appeal to you, especially the uncut version, which I was (un)fortunate to obtain.\n\nTom Six has made too many mistakes in this. Without realism this time round, the novelty is worn off. My curiosity is now depleted and I shan't bother watching the third instalment."

        "review_detailed_main": "I recognised The Human Centipede for the outrageously absurd and blackly humorous piece of OTT exploitation that it was, but not everyone got the joke: there were those who even called for the film to be banned. Quite how anyone could take a film about a mad surgeon creating a living chain of people seriously, I just don't understand, but then people get their knickers in a twist over all sorts of silly things, don't they?\n\nFor his sequel, director Tom Six tries to make his intentions even clearer, by ramping the violence and depravity to such extreme levels that no-one could possibly take it seriously\u2014or so you might think. As is always the way with this kind of entertainment, there are going to be those who simply have no sense of humour, who cannot see the fun to be had with brutal murder, amateur surgery, and masturbation with sandpaper, and call for the film to be severely cut (as it has been in the UK) or banned outright (as it has been in Australia).\n\nEven the unrated US version that I managed to see was bereft of one of the film's most infamous scenes, the 'barbed wire rape' of the rear segment of the 'centipede', but at least the rest was intact, meaning I got to enjoy the majority of the film as Six intended.\n\nAnd boy, it's a doozy!\n\nI haven't a clue where Six found the film's star Laurence R. Harvey, who plays Martin, a mentally messed up maniac totally obsessed with the first film, but I doubt a creepier guy even exists. Short of stature, sweaty, slimy, asthmatic, obese, with a look of utter madness in his bug eyes, Harvey simply oozes evil from every pore\u2014I wouldn't want to bump into this guy down a dark alley, that's for sure (especially if he was clutching a crowbar!).\n\nMartin is such a fan of Tom Six's infamous movie that he takes it upon himself to create a real-life 'ass to mouth' human chain, even though he has no medical experience whatsoever. Abducting twelve people unlucky enough to stray into his path (including the star of the first film, who he unbelievably dupes into flying to the UK to meet him), the drooling freak proceeds to messily construct his own human centipede, following the methods detailed by Dr. Heiter, the nutter from his favourite film. This set-up allows for plenty of incredibly bonkers gore and general nastiness, as Martin uses extreme force and shoddy surgery techniques to achieve his goal.\n\nOf course, simply making a centipede isn't enough for a sicko of Martin's calibre: he really wants to revel in the experience, and in one of the film's most disgusting moments, forces his victims to recreate a key scene from the first film by making them defecate into each others mouths. Other revolting highlights (or lowlights, if you're one of the morally outraged who dislike this kind of thing): Martin bashing his mother's head in with his crowbar; the removal of one victim's teeth using a hammer and chisel; graphic ligament cutting, buttock slicing and mouth stapling; and a pregnant woman giving birth in a car, accidentally crushing the newborn child when she stamps on the accelerator!!!!!!!!!! (there's not enough exclamation marks in the world to do this bit justice).\n\nFor deliberately going well beyond the bounds of good taste in a shameless attempt to offend, this film is undoubtedly worth a 10/10 in my eyes, but I'm still only going to give it a 9. Why? Because Six has The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence) in the works, and if that should be an even more inappropriate slice of odious debauchery than Part II, as I fully expect it to be, I need to leave myself the opportunity to rate it higher."

I'm sure in Martin's mind his objective was no different than the guys who make Star Wars fan fiction for you tube, but that's what makes his plan so disturbing, just like the doctor in the original.\n\nThe issue with this amazing plot is that it only last for five to ten minutes. The rest of the movie is pretty much a horror clich\u00e9 with Martian hunting down the dozen he needs to man his fan art.\n\nThe movie seems over gory and violent and I don't think it needed to be. Even though the original human centipede felt more \"scientifically accurate\" than what was stapled together here, the visual of a human centipede is still disturbing enough that it does not need to be over done with over the top effects that the filmmakers have access to I'm sure because they have more money now.\n\nYeah, it was a good idea, but when your dealing with sequels plot sometimes gets lost in an attempt to go better and bigger, and that's what happen here."

        "review_detailed_main": "In all that is moral and just, despite all criminal acts of a disturbed twisted mind and all the wars created by mankind, this movie is one of the most horrible movies of sincere decency there ever was.\n\nFor a movie this tasteless in how to make amends for \"too few\" disgusting movies on the macabre and insane, the only point that I can think of how it actually bears any kind of actual worth, is to explore the mind of some of the most downtrodden characters in the entire existence, a main character that is so utterly wrong and chaotic malevolent his very being breathes brimstone and fire from the very depths of diabolic society incarnated.\n\nThe acting is solid, that it is, but the writing in all it's awe gets more unrealistic the further the rabbit hole ensnares the skin to chains and hooks, gushing blood with such barbaric attitude it really makes me feel (understatement) uncomfortable.\n\nIn a psychological perspective, apart from it's abhorrent degrading manuscript as the movie progresses, it adds some realization to analyzing the very phenomenon of human intellect in which the violent nature takes its toll on those who was born in the very womb of mind flaying senseless deprivation.\n\nIt can be describe with three words, and three words only:\n\nSick and wrong\n\nPlain and simple.\n\nTo what unholy inspiration this has added to some of the most stupid ridiculous of modern cinematic industry, this one is an example of freedom that has no rhyme or reason, just for the absolute sake of it, and it holds no message in the radical or provocative genre, only because American Psycho did it a long time ago. There fore, it should never have been made."

Director, Tom Six, captures the gruesomeness of everything very well and has a little potential to be good. Having The Human Centipede 2 in black and white really adds to the film. I think it makes little more disgusting in black and white. Tom Six is just a shock value director and that's it. Tom Six also write this film and there isn't much to the script. It's just a disgusting story to get people cringing. As far as the performances go they aren't good, except for Laurence Harvey who plays Martin. Harvey gives an unsettling performance for a disgusting character. He's really gross to watch and I found myself at times taking my eyes of the screen. The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence) is a disgusting film that is made for shock value. If you want to watch this film go for it, but I don't recommend it."

        "review_detailed_main": "While not a better film, I would have to say Tom Six has taken it up a notch again, even on his already highly disturbing first film in the series 'The Human Centipede (First Sequence)'. The concept of the Human Centipede itself remains basically the same (although increasing from three to twelve people), but the villain is far more insane (didn't think I'd be saying that going in) and some of the surrounding events are nothing short of horrific. The final half hour was not an easy watch, even for someone who loves gory horror.\n\nThe film is not without flaws. The acting it must be said is pretty average throughout. Laurence R. Harvey couldn't really be criticised for the way he played his role as Martin, but he couldn't really be praised for it either. He doesn't speak a single audible line in the film and carries the movie more on his unique looks than anything. We are never given a chance to care for any of the victims like we are in the first. There are two reasons for this: 1) there are so many of them, 2) almost every one of them is portrayed as being pretty despicable before they are captured. It's very easy to say there wasn't a single likable character in the entire movie.\n\nThe concept of having a sequel based in the real world, where the first is actually a film itself is reasonably original (as far as I know) and I actually quite like the way it worked. Six clearly knew that the second time around he couldn't simply get away with the shocking originality of The Human Centipede and therefore had to take it up a notch in other departments. I can't even bring myself to type some of the shocking acts that take place in this film, suffice to say you'll need a strong stomach."

We don't really care about their probability, poor acting, ridiculous screenplay. But here we got too much of all of them. The script - saying it straight- doesn't even exist. It's a story about a man who's kidnapping people (in front of cameras...)because of his obsession of making a \"human centipede\". I hope i don't have to explain what \"human centipede\" is... I need to add that whole concept isn't the worst side of this movie- it's gore, disgusting and for sure can find some admirers...\n\nBut all of the rest of this \"piece of art\" is literally f****d up. I usually don't care about the montage but this thing has got none of editing. Actors? Porn stars are more believable and would play better than these ( how to name them?)...amateurs?\n\nFinally i have to write that i really appreciate filmmakers. I know it's hard to do a film that's really touching, funny, scary and so on. That's why i give 2 in IMDb range even for the biggest crap. But here we have a different situation. My boyfriend probably need help from therapist after watching this film :) So without feeling guilty i give \"The human centipede\" a big, red lightning 1, and i say to all of mankind avoid this movie like they avoid black death in medieval Europe! I had made a mistake and watched it...and that was the biggest mistake of my entire life..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Once the media circus died down following the emerging release of The Human Centipede (First Sequence) back in 2009, people actually sat down to watch it. Behind the reports of a macabre, utterly depraved film in which people were sown together ass-to-mouth and forced to s**t through each other as one huge digestive system, the movie itself was actually pretty tame. This was the main gripe a lot of people had with it, and it became a victim of its own hype (although I'm sure the film benefited from it financially). Director Tom Six's reaction to this was to make First Sequence seem like 'My Little Pony' compared to it's follow-up.\n\nAnd Part II does exactly that. Six has created an experience so utterly deplorable that even the most die-hard of gore-hounds will undoubtedly cringe at the horror on show. Every aspect of the film is designed to repulse it's viewers, causing critics of the first film to question whether this was the kind of debauchery they were hoping for in 2009. This approach may have been affective had Six demonstrated any hint of subtlety or artistic flair, but instead he delivers shock after shock like a cinematic endurance test and points and laughs at us like a giddy teenager showing someone 2 Girls 1 Cup for the first time. The idea came to him when he was asked if he thought a deranged fan could actually try and create their own human centipede, and his new antagonist was born.\n\nOverweight car park attendant Martin (Laurence R. Harvey) spends his days watching The Human Centipede on his laptop in his toll booth, and is such a huge fan of the film that he keeps a scrapbook containing movie stills, photographs of its actors, and hastily drawn diagrams of the grisly, yet '100% medically accurate' surgical procedure. Asthmatic and mentally retarded, he lives with his abusive and overbearing mother and was sexually abused as a child by his father. Tired of his miserable, repetitive existence, Martin decides to turn his fantasies into reality and create his own centipede. Not content with the work of Dr. Heitler in the first film, Martin plans a 12-strong centipede and starts to mutilate and kidnap his victims, storing them in a warehouse while he awaits the arrival of actress Ashlynn Yennie, who he has conned into coming to London on the promise of an audition for the next Tarantino movie.\n\nSix makes a point of showing Martin's lack of surgical skills. While First Sequence was crisp, clinical and in colour, Full Sequence is grimy, messy, and filmed in a depressing black-and-white. Rather than drugging his victims, Martin bashes them over his head with a crowbar, and unlike the surgical precision of Heitler, Martin duct tapes his victims and staples them together. It makes for a brutal experience, but its effects are dulled by some lazy writing - we are expected to believe the victims wouldn't struggle while their teeth are being knocked out one by one with a hammer or having the ligament in their knees removed. While I can certainly appreciate Six's desire to create something different to its predecessor, this is simply an unpleasant experience. I could appreciate disturbing, but Six opts for disgusting, and this exists simply to push your buttons."

Harvey, again Tom dis well in typecasting, like Dieter Laser (Dr. Heiter)the face of Laurence is really perverted.\n\nThe movie itself is shot in black and white what gives a more arty look toward the film but I must say that it worked very well with the bloody and gory shots. I even had a big laugh in the beginning were Martin (Laurence R. Harvey) is looking on DVD to the film The Human Centipede. He got ideas from that flick and wants to imitate Dr. Heiter. Naturally he has to capture victims and has to do surgery on the victims. It all starts slowly but after capturing a few victims it becomes bloodier and even creepier because he even has a pregnant one in his maze. The sound do adds the horror to it, it sounded like an ice cream car with bad sound. Once he's trying to make the human centipede the gore comes in. But before that we see his deranged mother and how he solves the conflict he's having with her. More and more the movie goes towards a sickie and the last part is gory as hell. I won't recommend it to the easily offended and surely not to the squeamish. I loved it, but again, it's not your usual flick.\n\nMaybe the shitty part is exaggerated and looks funny but still it will offend a lot of viewers.\n\nGore 4/5 Nudity 5/5 Effects 4/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5"

The same people pay to see snuff films and movies like Salo. Some of the scenes are well-done, just like in the first film, but there are more of them in this sequel. Also, the protagonist?

Nasty, but more believable in color. At least you could see a little more with color. They better make the 3rd one color or I will not watch any more of this directors movies.\n\nFor people that love black and white. Get into the future. It is not the early nineteen hundreds anymore. It is stupid. This is more nonsense. I would of really enjoyed this with more talking or something and color. I keep saying color, because you just don't enjoy watching something in black and white. I hope this is a clue to directors.\n\nIf I wanted a silent black and white movie, then I should got something from the 60's or older to watch that would be better than this crap. People that are saying this is art, are stupid. Normal horror movies are better than this. Anyone that takes a movie now a days to make it black and white must be one lost soul."

First Sequence had originality, shock and an admirably twisted performance from its lead ... Full Sequence is nothing but lewd crap.\n\nUgh ... I have never been as disgusted with any film in my life. For those who have seen the original -- well, I liked it. ALL of the characters here are cartoon-ized versions of movie characters AMPed to the nth degree.\n\nOur main character, Martin, is the sickest individual EVER created for a film. The film is done mainly in black and white to keep the blood and gore effects at a minimum; but this also makes the film (not only look but ...) feel cheap. I am supposed to be gleefully disgusted when watching a horror film ... not nauseated as Full Sequence made me feel.\n\nLook at THIS review ... and judge for yourself. Martin, is a grown-up, obese man boy who was molested by his father and is still ridiculed by his mother for putting said-father in prison; but Martin isn't an innocent ... and I am not convinced that he is a product of his environment either as this film is just SICK (sick sick). Licking his fingers while watching others be tortured? Pleasuring oneself with sand paper? Uhm ... I wanted to throw up many times while watching this.\n\nI highly recommend avoiding it ... it is NOT necessary and it is SO bad it has almost ruined the freaky-fun of the original. The first one was a surprisingly dark quirk; but this ... I've seen better things in public restroom toilets. Ugh ... don't eat before or while watching this ... or better yet: DON'T watch this."

This is a mixture of a grotesque trip into hell that has a real uncomfortable, and at times effective, feel and look, combined with some awful writing, poor acting, and a couple of broken plot points. The guy playing Martin does make for a unique leading role, and there are a few minor scenes that are blackly amusing, but to claim this as a black comedy is really pushing things a little far as it's just too bleak and unpalatable. By the end this has a god-awful sense of pointlessness, and along the way there's some graphic (yet clearly fake) violent torture and some other nastiness to sit through, but nothing to get upset about as it just comes across like it's trying way too hard to be crass and not offering enough in terms of depth, or indeed anything that most non- extreme viewers would actually ever want to see. If you must see it then it's not the worst film ever made, or the most morally backward, but it's nowhere near good enough to recommend."

Also the secondary characters were great like his mother and the guy upstairs. There was a strange amount of depth to this movie that it feels strange that such talent could go to such a low brow movie. I personally am thankfull for that and it is going to be very interesting to see where mr. tom six goes with the rest of his career.

There's always the thought in the back of your head that this could actually be happening which is the disturbing part - I think the aim of a good horror movie - otherwise we may as well watch the cartoon road runner blow up that old coyote in make believe land. Character development could have also served well to draw the viewer in. TS, don't base the entire movie on outlandishly gory/grotesque scenarios, and then in the next five minutes try to outdo yourself. Sadly, rating it a 6/10 with the thought this could have been a savagely disturbing 10/10 - the kind of movie whereby you're uneasy closing your eyes afterwords... I know that I couldn't put a movie together half as good as this, but oh well... too bad, this was a missed opportunity for TS."

We just wanted to forget about it.\n\nI related this information to my parents, as they both were excited for the new installment like I was.

There's nothing of substance here. The whole time, you sit there thinking, \"This can't possibly get worse.\" And then it does. That seems to be the only thing anyone was trying to accomplish in making this movie. I'm pretty sure they set out with the intent to make people throw up, and that's it.\n\nThis is not bad in a fun way. It's not so gross you have to see it... it's the opposite. I regret watching this movie. I have felt like I have wasted time on movies before, but this went so far beyond that. I wish I had never seen this movie and I hope others see this and choose not to inflict the same torture upon themselves.\n\nThis movie was so bad, it ruined the first one for me, too.

This felt like a darker version of John Waters that maybe took itself a little too seriously but I still appreciated the vibe. Despite the story being a bit slow, the style was interesting and took up for the pacing at times. It was atmospheric with its lack of color, interesting shots and some well done sound effects/design at times.\n\nThe main character was extraordinarily uncomfortable yet strangely compelling. I thought the way they maneuvered the story from the original to this one was actually quite interesting, clever and original. I think it was low key an interesting commentary and narrative on what we as a society, by way of the media, put out into the world to be consumed and the potential dangers that could manifest from it.\n\nBasically everything I have said thus far is in reference to the first two acts. After that it turned into torture porn in the third act once he really started trying to get his experiment to work. Despite a few cool effects here and there, It got to the point where it became gratuitous and silly and not in a fun, self-aware way.\n\nThis one was much more like what I thought the first one was going to be... torture porn with superfluous gore and violence in the name of shock factor. While I was pleasantly surprised with the other listed positive attributes and wanted to give it a six, the lack of finesse in the third act knocked it down for me. Would only recommend to true horror fans with a strong stomach."

Harvey's portrayal of martin(the films deranged and depraved antagonist) is sure to delight all genre fans . the film itself is really split into two parts,the characterization of martin and gathering of victims is the driving force behind the first part. the second part focuses on the assembling of the centipede and the victims reactions to the torture martin puts them through. but what with the awful acting,script(martin aside) and the fact that the black and white filter doesn't hide the bad lighting the first part falls a bit flat. in fact almost every line is delivered poorly and without any conviction .but somewhere in the mountain of shitness is Laurence r.Harvey.\n\nmr Harvey really drives the first act to the point where he may well be the only reason to continue watching. the silent and brooding in puts into martin is electrifying and actually quite terrifying . he has absolutely no remorse and that gets very scary come the part of the film\n\nthere is a very sudden shift half way through, and it is a shift for the best. the black and white makes sense and ads to the intensity and makes martin all the more menacing and the bad acting isn't important anymore ,as there is only screams and groans from here out,what you are treated to from here out is balls to the wall filth until the credits roll , for some this may well be the movie you have been waiting for it is depraved,sick,twisted,gross,stomach churning and at times relentless in the sense that it just gets sicker and sicker.\n\nits hard to score this any better than a 5 because in all honesty i didn't enjoy watching it,but i couldn't turn it of .it just kept me glued its a no win situation ,for me a film like this will never be great because of how gruesome it is (i did expect that when watching it) , but it will never be rubbish because it pushes the en envelope and keeps me morbidly entertained\n\nwithout wanting to ruin it for anyone ill end by saying that in terms of vulgarity new cinematic lows are reached in the uncut version of this film.the gore on screen is horrendous and the actions of martin (the centipede aside ) are also quite horrific.\n\nall things aside don't eat before you watch this film ,be prepared to see something that will shock you.and try to remember its just a film."

It is surprisingly different from the first, however, this time with less tension and fear of the idea and instead being filled with gore, gore, and more gore.\n\nThat is, in fact, all this film has to offer. It has gore ranging from a person being shot in the leg all the way up to a newborn's head being smashed. There are scenes in here witch made me question why I was even watching this.\n\nThere is no such thing as character development, something vital in horror films as the effect is only amplified by being attached to the protagonist or whoever else. In this movie, character development is replaced with disturbing scenes and unlovable, one-sided characters.\n\nI don't give this film a 3/10 simply because it has gore, I give it that because gore is all it has. You need something besides gore to help make it interesting. Whether that be action, romance, frolicking through daisies, or whatever, there has to be something else. Most horror movies have moments where the protagonist can catch their breath, away from whatever horrors they face. Not here, after each time you see someone being cut open and die someone else gets cut open. It's exhausting and repetitive to say the least."

Also it was hard to believe that a weak and badly out of shape person like him was even able to move bodies into his van. It's also funny how there were no witnesses and authorities present in the movie which allowed no chance for Maritin to be caught. The movie was definitely more gruesome than the previous movie, but that was only after around 55 minutes into the movie. I felt like the black and white made the movie seem less gruesome and made the victims not seem real for me because it definitely would've been a bit harder to watch those scenes in colour."

It's surreal that a situation like this would go so smoothly without a hitch and makes people seem as stupid as those corny horror movies with the actors who honestly think it's a good idea to wander around on the patio when a killer rings on your doorbell.\n\nSimply put, if you have a weak stomach..go for it, you MIGHT enjoy it (in a sick sense)."

Even worse, it makes the same mistakes as the first film and makes entirely new mistakes to add them. The plot is simple: a lunatic named Martin watched the first film and got even crazier, proposing himself to make the same \"centipede experience\" with a higher number of people. That is. Deep down, there is no plot. What is given to us is a motive, a cause for us to be able to watch what we have already seen in the first film, but on a much larger scale and dimension.\n\nI've never been a fan of gore movies, despite being an admirer of horror. Blood and fluids don't scare me, and I honestly do not feel like watching a movie if I suspect it's going to make me throw up my lunch. But my will decreases when I check that the film is absolutely crazy and was made by a probably even more crazy director (in this case it's Tom Six). So why did I watch this movie? Because I thought it might be a bit better than the first. I was wrong, of course. Again, we have no decent actors or interpretations. In fact, we don't even have characters! The only character that deserves, minimally, that name, is Martin, because it is the unique one that has been minimally developed. At least this time I think the film gave up any credibility, turning down that revolting \"medically accurate\" that appeared ostensibly in the first film."

What little story is present is substituted for shock scenes. The little moments in First sequence were short and hard hitting, and sometimes required your mind to finish the puzzle as it often shied away from showing too much violence. Here, it's cranked up to 12.\n\nFull Sequence seems to reckon that assaulting your senses with unabashed vileness and unbearably persistent shocks will suffice enough to get a rise out of the audience. While yes, the violence is absolutely wince-inducing, but Full Sequence favors this over anything else. When something is done repeatedly, it becomes repetitive and stale, and eventually, it becomes more annoying more than anything: that is how the violence works in Full Sequence.\n\nA small nugget of character is offered in the protagonist, however, so little is ever elaborated about him other than his 'past trauma' and the centipede influence, but at least Lawrence R. Harvey gives a great performance as the maniacal security guard.\n\nTrue, the violence can spook, but only for so long before it deteriorates and becomes loud, obnoxious noise. You will get what you came for, but don't be disappointed when you find nothing else behind these monotonous horizons. It does only what it says on the tin, what did you expect?"

However with this film, i will say that i was genuinely terrified, this movie is obviously a hell of a lot more realistic than the first as the main character is pretty much the viewer and the actual horror element is amped up to the top.\n\nI appreciate the fact that these movies are gross and silly but this movie was just a piece of garbage, the guy in the movie almost gave me nightmares he gave such a creepy performance, no funniness coming from this guy, just sick perversions, yuck, he is just vile in so many ways.\n\nI hope people aren't going to watch this movie expecting a bit of a laugh, because you will be very disappointed. Its all just rubbish, but i guess it is something you should make up your own mind about.

He kidnaps many people and he creates a 12-person centipede to complete his dream.\n\nI did not like this movie and I believe that every person who is prepared because of the first movie and he plans to watch this one then I have to say that this movie is more disgusting than the first and it has many scenes that are very horrible. The last thing that I discover is that in 2014 will come out the last movie of this trilogy with title \"The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence)\". So we have more of that to watch."

There's gallons of blood and other bodily fluids and it feels like the director just wanted to make the most graphic movie he possibly could. I have no problem at all with movie violence, some of my favourite movies are very gory but this time it comes across as so forced it makes for a boring and pointless movie. It's like it was written by an edgy 16 year old and the tone feels like the director thought he was being really clever and provocative but it's just annoying.\n\nThe acting is absolutely terrible by everyone involved, there are no likeable characters and i feel sorry for any of the actors who thought this was going to be their big break.\n\nCould maybe be a movie you could laugh at with a few friends over a few beers but it isn't worth watching other than that.\n\nDon't bother, spend your money on a sandwich instead. I recommend a nice BLT."

However if you are into exploitation cinema and you enjoyed th first watch this you'll no doubt enjoy it. The problem for me is that i thought it went a bit too over the top and the style the original had is now lost. For fans of this look forward to number 3 where the director has said \"Number 3 will be like a Disney film compared to 2\", this worries me as SPOILER the last shot of this film is the villain creeply staring at a toddler"

This is the story of a mentally ill security guard who is so obsessed with the first Human Centipede movie that he decides to make his own Centipede . This time with twelve people and with no medical background whatsoever. You will agree , it's a clever premise , but that's the only good thing you can say about this film.\n\nShot in Black and White ' this film is so revolting that you feel that you need to jump in the shower after watching it. The main actor ( who does not talk ) is a disgusting looking fat man and his vulgarity just adds to the unpleasantness of the film.\n\nIt is extremely violent , it has some really nasty scenes in it . One where he knocks a man's teeth , slowly with a hammer , really springs to mind. It has no redeemable features and you have to wonder what was going through the actors minds when they was shooting this movie.\n\nHuman Centipede is a completely unnecessary film that tries to shock for shocks sake and should be avoided at all costs."

I grew up during the golden age of slasher flicks and my cinematic diet for most of my life has been mostly low-grade stupid trash, but this sort of movie does nothing for me. It's like a couple of junior high school kids stayed up late on a Friday night and wrote a premise for what they thought would be cool, gross horror movie and some adult found it in the trash and decided to flesh it out into a screenplay. No suspense, no fun, and defying even the most tolerant suspense of disbelief, this thing plods on until it's grisly conclusion and who cares? And they made another one of these things? It took me this long to bother with the second one, so let's see if I make it to part three. I'll give it some credit for upping the ante on shock value a little bit, but it was probably surpassed long before I bothered to watch this thing. Just more unimaginative, pointless trash in an age of pointless trash. Grownups will hate it and nitwits will love it."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film definitely ups the ante in terms of gore and straight-up disgusting things, but it's also full of itself and pretentious by trying to make social commentary. This sequel treats the previous movie as a work of fiction, and the main character is a fat, grotesque slob who is obsessed with it to the point of wanting to recreate the titular \"human centipede\" with 12 people this time instead of three. Although there are some brief moments where you get a glimpse into this man's life, most of the movie is concerned with him rounding up his victims, which gets tedious after a while. He has a job in a London parking garage, so when he sees somebody stranded he leaves his post and incapacitates them, usually with a gun and a crowbar. Very (not) interesting. Even though his character is almost completely unsympathetic, the way the actor plays him is rather interesting. Not only is he a fat slob, but he's also got some mommy and daddy issues as well as severe asthma. He also has a tendency to lick his fingers. These tics make for some of the more entertaining parts of the movie, because he's pretty inept when it comes to everything else. When it gets to the finale where he finally puts his \"creation\" together, it's as gross as you'd expect. At this point, I should mention that the movie is in black and white...mostly. There's a few splotches of a certain color once he gives all 11 members of his \"centipede\" a laxative. The reason there's only 11 is because the 12th, a pregnant woman, is knocked unconscious for a while. This woman manages to escape, resulting in one of the more graphic abortions I've seen on film (probably the only one). The movie ends shortly thereafter, but with one twist which I won't give away (maybe you can guess...). Anyway, the movie is probably trying to say something about society's violent tendencies, or maybe about the ridiculousness of taking some violent horror films seriously (like Tom Six's own HUMAN CENTIPEDE). Whatever the \"message\", it gets lost among the filth and the gore. My recommendation would be to skip it, unless you're absolutely into this type of movie."

Have you seen \"The Human Centipede\"? if so you will have a very good idea of the level of acting in this film. In favor of the film, the plot is fairly well scripted,but the dialog is cheesy at best. The violence in the film is very \"tongue in cheek.\" (pun intended.) And is pitched in a similar way as \"Texas Vibrator Massacre.\" by Rob Rotten. This I feel is the main reason both film were banned by the bbfc. Ironically porn by \"maxxx hardcore\" or a film such as \"nil by mouth\" are by far more horrific, even through they are not in the 'horror.' genre, whereas this film is in the horror genre but would be more suited to the \"soft porn \" genre. If you a looking for a torture gore fest then \"SAW\" or similar has the budget to out do this film. IF on the other hand you are looking for a intelligent satire on a serial killer then \"Henry portrait of a serial killer \" or \"Se7ven\" would be a better choice. For a satire on scat and ass to mouth porn,and the challenge that it can be morally acceptable,this is the film to tick this box."

        "review_detailed_main": "Back when IMDB had forums I read something that changed how I thought about this movie: it's anti-art. By this I don't mean that it's simply really bad (which it is) but that it's deliberately a rejection of everything a good movie (even a good horror movie) is.\n\nGiving it every benefit of the doubt, it's an experiment of how much a reputation can carry a terrible movie. I was really anxious beginning this movie. He did say it would make the first look like My Little Pony (it kind of does because MLP is so good) and it did actually got banned for a bit. The quotes I'd read from it suggested to me that this movie pulls zero punches.\n\nBut when you actually watch it, I can almost say objectively that it is not well made. The dialogue is laughable, the characters are one dimensional, the plot is only in two acts (he wants to do a thing; he does it. And I like the 3 act structure dang it!), and the plot barely makes any sense at all.\n\nLet's focus on some things I did like for a moment. It's very different from the first movie, not just in its look: moving away from the sleek, clinical yet stylish modernity of the first movie to this brilliantly sordid vision of London where you can feel the filth and the isolation. Martin is really the only really good thing in the movie. Meaning no disrespect to the actor but he was pretty terrifying to watch in the way he manages to look like an infant and a lecherous old man all at once. He alone brings a sense of professionalism to the movie and almost with no lines. Tom Six is really not great at dialogue but scenarios. I wonder if the movie had been edited to maybe about 30 minutes it really could have been something. Take out the risible dialogue and acting and we really would have a movie that is frightening in the old fashioned way: an unlovely, uncompromising descent into the depths of human misery and sadism with no sense of hope for anyone. You see flashes of this once in a while, certainly in the ending and also in the pathos of Martin wearing his doctor's jacket.\n\nAnd of course, yes it is physically repugnant. It takes it to a point where it just loses all the mystique of the human of the human body and just becomes a slightly squeamish bore by the end.\n\nI have this fantasy that a bunch of teens with a new friend, some shy kid who isn't good with horror but wants to fit in, watch this movie together. Everyone is vomiting by the end or has nightmares for weeks but the new kid realizes they were anxious for nothing since the movie is trash. It is an exercise in how you can generate such a hype for a movie even when it has actually very little to offer beyond the most superficial kind of terror.\n\nAnd as for the idea of people doing the experiment in real life: it doesn't explore that at all beyond maybe reminding us of it through two lines of dialogue. The first movie (even though it's a work of fiction in this movie) felt far more real than this. it's not a covert remake, it's not self parody, it's self plagiarism.\n\nSix clearly did not make the first movie to get people used to the idea. That WAS the movie and this is a desperate cash in by a film make that finally had an original idea.\n\nAs I often say for these kinds of movies it's...an experience but I cannot give this movie more than 4 out of 10. Even watching it ironically. It could be a laugh I guess."

        "review_detailed_main": "WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING!!!! Will Ferrel playing mad scientist? Maybe a Disney production where Love triumphs regardless of everything thrown at it? This is not 1931, where in order for your mind to be at piece, the scene of Frankenstein's monster killing the little girl has to be cut and forever lost. Yes, the film in question, definitely is sick and disturbing, but is just that, a make believe on a movie screen, and it must be evaluated on itself. Regardless, it seems that every one that reviewed it as a bad movie was trying to protect others from this nightmare because that's what it is! It's disgusting yet masterfully created, to every conceivable detail on Tom Six's sick mind.\n\nI tried to respect your perspective, but being fair I have hardly ever found another monster as \"Martin\" portrayed not just as the \"Norman Bates\" of this decade or \"Willard Stiles\" and the acting and direction is near perfection (except for the mom). One of the reasons that makes this a good movie is that we found someone so disconnected with reality, without a single speck of remorse, and still capable of \"Loving Sympathy\" towards a child, that makes us wonder for how long will still be a civilization. Maybe you would have preferred a lot of CGI, and scarlet blood, but if you dislike it in B&W, probably you would have had a heart attack if this movie has been made in full color. Let's mention that \"The Elephant Man\" was filmed in Black and white to protect the makeup and give to the film the feeling of time, (particularly I love black and white films). And I believe the making on B&W of the centipede II, serves, to protect not just the lack of FX, but the viewers at the same time. As I read some of the reviews I felt like some people expected to see immediately the \"Human Centipede\". instead the filmmaker build for us in the first part the main characters, slowly and precisely enough to give us their reasons and motives, and this is what I call the process of filmmaking, as I say if you do not understand a truly Horror movie, stick yourself to Ghostbusters and feel at ease, or if your daring is not that limited watch \"Dexter\" every week, but don't step into unknown world where your sensibility will affect your judgment,and as proof of bad, there's truly abominations as \" August Underground\" that lacks everything that could be considered as a movie. So for me, \"The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)\" is better than the original and unfortunately for me, I can't wait for the next install of it, and probably with Hollywood involved on it, it is going to suck big time,! If you saw the first film, you knew what could be in store for this sequel! If not, you were blindsided by whoever recommend or drag you to see it. Still you do not have an excuse The movie opens with a WARNING of what you are about to see, so don't cry foul and blame the concept for it! Certainly I felt compelled to look away, certainly I needed to pause it and go away for a minute to breathe fresh air, still this movie is not sicker than \"Martyrs\", or \"Inside\", but I can't turn away just because I feel offended, nowadays, TV, shows, some of the things we saw and heard on it, and many of you take it with a laugh, c'mon, grow up, I felt more offended and horrified with Miley Cyrus' MTV VMAs performance, why? Because no one warned me about the twerking of such tweaker!"

That's not a bad thing mind you, as everyone needs to make a living, but on an artistic front it sucks balls. You could argue that Human Centipede 2 was also made to deepen the pockets of Mr. Tom Six. But where his sequel differs from most of the other sequels out there is that, he actually did try improving on his second effort. He listened to his critics and his fans and put his thinking cap on to deliver a film that exceeded the original in every way possible \u2013 and I believe he did just that.\n\nWith the original, we witnessed a Mad Scientist torture and mutate a trio of humans into a weeping, crawling, pooping machine. I thought it worked, as the doctor delivered a good enough performance to carry the film. So how can you improve upon a Mad Scientist? You don't get much cooler than a raving scientist. Just ask Professor Farnsworth. One way to work things out is to think in the absolute opposite direction. And in this case, taking the polar opposite route worked brilliantly. Instead of a handsome, fit, and fiercely intelligent German scientist, we're delivered\u0085.well, I don't wanna be mean, but we're delivered the opposite\u0085in the shape of a small rotund British man named, Martin.\n\nMartin lives at home with his Mum, and works as an overnight security guard for a building's parking lot. The overnight gig not only puts food in his belly, but also gives him the opportunity to watch movies. I mean, movie. Martin, like any dedicated fanboy, watches his favorite movie, The Human Centipede nonstop. He's put together a collage book. He obsesses over the pretty girls in the movie. He has a pet centipede. He is quite simply fixated with all things Centipede. So much so in fact, that he's already initiated the process of creating his own Human Centipede \u2013 but this time with a dozen people. Martin thinks he can do it. He's got the passion, he's got the plan, and now he just needs the bodies.\n\nWith basically the whole story revolving around Martin's Centipede escapades, the film obviously has to deliver in other areas besides finding ways to attach faces to butts. Martin, psycho serial killer In the making, must surely have some type of back-story, right? He's not just an obsessed fan, right? Right. A much smaller secondary story resides in Martin's living situation with his dear ole Mum. I'm not going to ruin anything here for you, but let's just say Martin's past and present has been riddled with misfortune. So much so, that there are moments where you may be sympathetic towards the guy. Not sympathetic towards his goals, but towards his mental state. The Mother Son story delivered for me. It's been there done that stuff, but it was handled well, and of course, with Six's atypical touch.\n\nTo clear things up, the cut version of HC2 is no slouch. As a movie that is supposed to up the ante, it most certainly does. It improves upon the story, the lead character, the violence and everything that entails, and it also shows that Tom Six has improved as a director. Credit must be owed to Six in some way for helping the first-time actor, Laurence R. Harvey (Martin) deliver the performance he did. He didn't speak a single line, and still managed to convey a deeply troubled soul. Big ups to both you guys.\n\nThe Human Centipede, title alone, is reason enough for many to scoff, but that's fair, as it's pretty easy to judge this book by its cover or title. Assuming critics and disappointed detractors of the first will probably be overly judgmental and harsh, but not I, and not you! We both personally applaud the ideas, and willingness to push cinematic envelopes. The movie isn't perfect, and anyone with a clue can realize that, but as a sequel (and a horror film), it's legit, and tries to be a true sequel \u2013 succeeding at becoming a movie unto itself. A horrid, ugly tale of mental psychosis that's spliced with nightmarish fanboy heresy all sewn together to create an altogether abnormal horror film that will have you seeing brown.\n\nI look forward to checking out the uncut verison as I hear it may be a bit different. One thing is for certain and that's I can definitely see myself rewatching this film, rewinding it, and rewatching it again\u0085and again\u0085and again\u0085and again\u0085\n\nNow - I pretty much stand by this review and have since seen the uncut version with sandpaper and barbwire intact, and it's all just extra good fun."

My own medical students agreed with me that their lives were enhanced and their spirituality has strengthened, for this movie opened their third eye much as God opens the eyes of mortals to the world beyond the physical. That is to say, this film can be replaced with whatever spiritual practice you wish yourself to do as it is equally as compelling as any religious text. May the centipede god bless you."

Shooting it in black and white was a good decision to make it look more macabre, since the color version is not as disturbing and the special effects are obvious. It was strange that, instead of being a direct continuation, it is a film where the previous one is pure fiction within it. The story is very good because of how it focuses on Martin's psychology, which shows that he suffered many misfortunes to the point of becoming a psychopath. It has many strong and disgusting scenes that I found quite funny and enjoyed. It is not a film suitable for sensitive people and that is why it is a spectacular film for those of us who like the morbid and extreme. My rating for this movie is a 10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "I love to check out a hard hitting disturbing movie from time to time.... part of being a film fanatic is that i enjoy all genre's and push to find the best of the best within each genre which led me to this... the human centipede 2. I was a fan of the first one, was great to see a new idea which has not been done before and to get away from the likes of Saw, Hostel and all the copy cat movies alike. The first Human Centipede had not been done before and was original... very disturbing storyline but hey thats what the films supposed to do right?\n\nOK on to this one. Well wow if you thought the first one was disturbing then your in for a wake up call with this. Human Centipede 2 makes number 1 seem like a 15 certificate mild movie in comparison. Remember all the things you did not see in Human Centipede 1? Detail wise, feeling uncomfortable with knowing what was going on but not really seeing it to much degree. Part 1 left a lot to the imagination whilst part 2 up's the ante giving you full on exposure leaving nothing to the imagination. The hype associated with this film is that it was banned and had a very hard time trying to get released, i read somewhere that it is the most cut film in history so far. Now i have heard hype like this many times, the original Texas chainsaw massacre for example and i was left with the feeling of 'it wasn't THAT bad.' This however meets the anticipated expectation of bing a full on disturbing and visually vile film. It achieves it's goals and does exactly what it sets out to do.\n\nI know put this in my top 5 disturbing films list and i have seen a lot of movies of this nature as i have comedy & action etc (im a film buff remember?) I remember when i first heard this was all shot in black and white. I was totally gutted thinking it would ruin everything for me. How wrong was i. Being shot in black and white it somehow totally works for this movie. I do not want to talk about the most disturbing parts etc as i feel it would ruin the shock value for you but i would say if your looking for something to make your top 5 disturbing films list and your in the frame of mind and mood for a film of the shock value genre then your in the right place with this.\n\nI hear there is going to be a part 3 that is even worse... how thats possible i have no idea."

When Night of the Living Dead came out in 1968 it generated much the same reactions as HC2 for many or the same reasons: Gruesome plot & graphic shots of people being tortured, dismembered & eaten alive. As I recall, the makers of that film had to get their props fresh from an abattoir to make things look real. And boy, did it work.\n\nI see HC2 as the 21st century's NOTLD. True, there's some updating here: the use of staple guns, crowbars & duct tape as opposed to axes & plain old zombie brute strength. And more focus on the pain we inflict (or dream of inflicting, even if metaphorically) on one another as opposed to the (hopeless?) dream of escape from terror.\n\nI think HC2 (paired with HC1 before it) is a real work of art: Brilliantly executed technically, a wonderful adjustment of perspective from the previous film & hugely adept at peeling back the social politesse to reveal what lurks underneath the surface for many of us.\n\nI'm not saying we're all Martin, but if we don't try to understand Martin for what he is & why he is what he is, then more of us will be Martn's victims.\n\nCan't wait to see HC3."

        "review_detailed_main": "I didn't like The Human Centipede. As much as I like to see originality in films, THC just didn't do it for me at all - I found the fundamental concept laughable, the tone contradictory (intended to be a dark and shocking film, supported by a cast of pantomime characters and a cartoon villain...) and I just couldn't find it in myself to be frightened by the concept of being surgically forced to 'eat da poo poo'.\n\nThe Human Centipede 2, on the other hand... Suffice to say I've never seen a movie director improve and mature so much in such a short period of time. THC2: Full Sequence is a gorgeously creative, unique and original film, cultured and sophisticated to the point that it's almost a shame it has to share a name with its predecessor. The first act has more than a little in common with David Lynch's 'Eraserhead', the dream-like atmosphere serving to help you to distance yourself from the rest of the film's explicit content.\n\nTHC2 is a meta-sequel, set outside of the world of its namesake - think Return of the Living Dead, Wes Craven's New Nightmare or Halloween III: Season of the Witch - and revolves around a mute, asthma inhaler wielding sociopath, obsessed with the original film, attempting to recreate its \"100% medically accurate\" content for real, substituting surgical experience with brute force, a crowbar and staple gun.\n\nHere's the thing - the film is difficult to review as the 'good film checklist' doesn't apply here. THC2 can't be judged on the same scale as your typical movie because of the way it tells its story. For example, the severe lack of character development is one of the film's strongest points; the director wants you to follow one character - the antagonist (or protagonist?) - as he works on his 'project'. I can guarantee you'll find pages of reviews ridiculing the lack of any character development for any of the innocent people who meet their gory fates here, but this and the black & white presentation shift the focus away from 'nasty scary movie' and in the direction of an intriguing art film. You aren't supposed to be fearing for the lives of the innocents, but rather watching in fascination, almost seeing the world through the eyes of the 'villain', to whom these humans are no more than ingredients in his recipe.\n\nI would also expect to see many reviewers claiming this film to be 'the most explicit thing (they've) seen', and while objectionable content is probably more prevalent here than in many (or any) other mainstream movies, I risk repeating myself in stating that this really isn't the focus.\n\nI was as happy as a pig in the brown stuff to have such a stylised, almost Lynch-like film sprung on me in the middle of one of my mates' regular beer & double-feature nights which usually entail brainless horror films, but it wasn't without its share of drawbacks, particularly later on in the film when a pregnant character endures a far-too-predictable and completely implausible sequence of events.\n\nOverall an impressive and ferociously unique film, bound to anger a few prudes. Watch it just to be able to say that you've watched it, and hopefully you will appreciate this surprising leap forward for the post-Hostel gore genre as I did. I can't wait to see what comes next."

Its ridiculous.\n\nWell done to Mr Six for creating something which has got so many people talking - I mean just when was the last time that happened with a horror movie? Shouldn't horror be....well...horrific lol?\n\nTo be honest I thought the first one was much more grim, I got a few laughs watching it but nowhere near as much as this. My only annoyance is why they released it in black and white. I reckon it would have been much more gross in colour (hence just 8 stars). Seems Mr Six thought the black and white gave it a more grim feeling but it reminded me (very slightly) of Man Bites Dog by doing that, but again, this to me was a COMEDY. True, a pretty sick one, but I relished every minute. And yes, I did see the uncut directors version, so stuff you Mr BBFC. Who gives you the right to police what we watch eh? I cant wait for the final chapter. I really don't know what will come next, but to all of you so appalled by this kind of thing, go back to watching movies like Scream, or the Sixth Sense or something.

So if you, like me, love sick movies, you will probably not be disappointed. It is also, like the first film, quite innovative (even though, if you think sick movies needs to justify themselves with social commentary or something like that - look elsewhere). But this one is much sicker. I must also say that the acting by Laurence R. Harvey was outstanding, which lifted the movie even more.\n\nI was a little skeptical about the black and white, but I can tell you that this movie is really worth watching anyway.

I could not see any direct purpose of making this movie in black and white, and it would have been even better in color. But as I said, don't let it scare you away.

Often shocking and constantly upping itself, it's clearly created by a twisted and untethered mind, allowing themselves to go wherever they want. This is something I can respect, especially considering the substantially negative (but still substantial) emotional experience I received from watching this. This films (most likely thematically purposeless) monochromatic style does add a lot to the surreal bleak nightmarish darkness, and can actually be sort of beautiful in a gritty almost Eraserhead type of well. Lots of harsh inky shadows and glowing hazy white light, you'd think it'd take away from the brutality but it only makes it more textured with an additional liminal effect. The film is carried by its near entirely mute (save for some grunts and whimpers) lead, played disgustingly yet perfectly by Laurence R. Harvey. He's actually the best part of the unsalvageably unlikeable next installment as well, with a different role where he plays a more bumbling and comedic style of character and really shows his range as an actor and his ability to elevate these films."
