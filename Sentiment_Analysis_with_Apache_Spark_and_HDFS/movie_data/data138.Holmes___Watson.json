It is not nearly as creative as many detective movies or shows. Nothing stands out or is memorable.\n\nOverall: An unnecessary Sherlock movie that had no reason to be made. A simplistic movie that has nothing innovative or genuine. Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly play the same goofballs in their other movies, but the lack of story and not much to work with, turn this movie into a waste of good talent. \"Step Brothers\" and \"Talladega Nights\" are a step above this one.\n\n2/5"

        "review_detailed_main": "I honestly don't hate Reilly or Ferrell. I've seen both of them do fantastic jobs with decent scripts. This film...does not have one of those.\n\nHolmes and Watson could have been great - after all, the Sherlock Holmes character, being such a cultural icon, is ripe for parody. But this movie does NOTHING with its premise. In fact, most of the script could just have been copy-pasted from your standard brainless buddy comedy set in modern America, with barely any changes.\n\nFor one thing, the film has barely any plot - instead, the titular characters simply stumble from one scene to the next, encountering various people of no real consequence (even Moriarty - played by the fantastic Ralph Finnes, a casting choice that would have been so much better in a serious adaptation - is barely in the movie and feels like an afterthought). And sure, not every comedy needs a strong plot; but when you're making a film about Sherlock Holmes, whose very character is built on strong murder mystery plots, you need to at least ATTEMPT to give your parody something of a story.\n\nAnd for another, the jokes are just painful. As mentioned, most of them barely relate to the Sherlock Holmes character at all - they're just standard slapstick jokes transplanted into a Victorian setting, with barely any changes; or else painful attempts at being \"topical\" that'll feel horrendously outdated in a few months. The film makes no real effort to satirise the Holmes character - in fact, it never makes us feel like we're watching Sherlock Holmes or John Watson on the screen at all. Instead, we just feel like we're watching Will Ferrell and John C Reilly faffing around in costumes and putting on dumb accents, and the film never tries to convince us otherwise.\n\nIt's just low-effort tripe beginning to end. Modern comedy feels like a cesspit sometimes."

However, Holmes (Will Ferrell) is an idiot and seems to do his best to help Moriarty escape....and having his devoted partner hung instead! And, in doing so, he's allowing Moriarty's plot to kill the Queen to move forward.\n\nOne of my favorite comedies is \"Talladega Nights\" starring Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly. And, while not as funny, their film \"Step Brothers\" also makes me smile. So, you'd think that the pair would pretty much a guarantee of a good laugh....though \"Holmes & Watson\" is ample proof that even this duo can make a dud. And, it all boils down to the script, as \"Holmes & Watson\" hasn't a single laugh in the film. Instead, it resorts to the cheap and disgusting...such as vomiting, an autopsy, male lactation, horse excrement, and urination. Most children could write a script funnier than this bilge.\n\nThe bottom line is that even funny folks need a competent script....and this script is pure crap through and through. Unfunny, mean-spirited and stupid....that's \"Holmes & Watson\". Rarely has a film cost this much and delivered so little.\n\nBy the way, if you watch this film (DON'T), it's obvious they set it up for a sequel. Considering nearly everyone hated \"Holmes & Watson\" the chances of this sequel are pretty much one in a billion (give or take 10)."

No, it is sloppily, uncaringly written, and nothing about it gives any impression that anyone behind the camera put more than minimal thought into the movie. There are shots that are out of focus.\n\nAh, you say, but how about the jokes. There is one good gag, in which the Robert Downey movies are mocked: overcranked sequences in which Holmes analyses what a course of action will yield..... only to have his analysis turn out long. This gag is done three times. There are also urine jokes, sexual assault jokes, and other examples of juvenile humor which are not elaborated, only repeated.\n\nI've wasted an hour and a half watching this piece of garbage and another ten minutes writing this. That's more than enough."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's been ten years since Will Farrell and John C Reilly starred in a movie together. Their previous two outtings not only done well at the box office but are now considered to be classic. This movie must have been something many comedy fans have been waiting for... but what went wrong? I don't think I've read such bad reviews for quite sometime. Luckily or some may say unluckily I went to see it before I read anything about the movie. Honestly, I don't think the world needs another Sherlock Holmes spoof, it's been done to death almost as much as spoofing James Bond but I was in the mood for a comedy and this was really my only choice. Comedy at the cinema isn't as easy to come by nowadays I find, so seeing these two guys in a film together again I thought.... it can't be that bad. My honest opinion is... well it isn't that bad. Moments made me laugh, I felt it was paced well and although not as good as their last two movies I felt their fans would get something from it. I do however see why people are disappointed. Ferrell's portrait as Holmes, I can seeing being annoying to many, it's pretty crude for a 12 certificate (UK , guessing PG-13 in the US)..Mostly though I think is the advertising of the rest of the cast. Several actors names are on the posters, they appear in the trailer but are barely in it. Steve Coogan has a cameo at best. Fans of these actors will only come away disappointed. If they were unexpected,I think the audience would come away pleased with their appearances. Like when Bill Murray pops up in 'Zombieland' for example. Overall it made me chuckle a fair bit, which is the point of a comedy and I can't think of many films that have done thst for me this year. Most of the comedies we get are animated (lately far more laughs in a pixar than in a live action movie) or the odd random film like 'tag' which although a better made film than this, I dont think I laughed more. I do miss the days of looking forward to the latest movies from my favourite comic actors like Steve Martin, John Candy, Chevy Chase and even Adam Sandler. I saw Will Farrell as one of the last of this breed. It would be a shame for this misfired movie to ruin his career. I think in years to come it will be seen as more favourable. Also I couldn't help comparing it to the Peter Cook/Dudley Moore 'Hound of the baskervilles' another bomb with a great cast. Actually I say give that movie a go, you may realise this one isn't too bad after all. Hollywood comedy seems in a slump at the moment, we either need to not have our expectations too high or possibly throw movies the way of new talent? Maybe both. After this I'm not sure this pair will get the chance to make other film together. A shame.... who knows though they may need the money and the audience get the long awaited Stepbrothers 2. At least they tried something different I guess, remember the first 'Police Academy' was great but sequels aren't always the way forward."

It's a shame as it has a high production value, but the script is just horrificly bad. It can't even be labeled a satire as the jokes just weren't funny (well maybe if you're drunk and stoned out of your head). I wonder who approved the script, and that's just a big shame. Making a Holmes comedy would have been great if they writing and jokes were excellent, previous Holmes comedies have proven it, but the jokes don't reach a stage beyond the piss and sex jokes (and not even funny at that). Such a shame, because if it had a good script/story it would have been a great movie as the cast itself can't be blamed for it. John C. Reilly makes a great Watson, and Ferrell could have been if he didn't play as he always does (I think he had his hand in the script as it has the same kind of awful jokes he normally plays in)."

And I was pleasantly surprised. It reminded me of the hay day of slapstick satirical comedy. It felt right at home with other films of this nature, like The Pink Panther, Monty Python, and even some of Mel Brooks' films, albeit not quite as good as those.\n\nIt never took itself too seriously and was very honest with the humor it wanted to get across. Satire and slapstick abound, the jokes were great and actually pretty clever and well paced.\n\nWill Ferrell did a great job portraying a satirically narcissistic Holmes and John C. Reilly did an amazing job at playing a \"never good enough\" Watson. All of the supporting characters were well cast and never felt out of place, or forced and added a great level of humor to supplement the titular characters.\n\nAll in all, it's a satire by every definition of the word, and if you don't get that, or get offended by everything, stay away from it. Otherwise, turn your brain off and enjoy the ride, it's worth it!"

A friend at work told me \"I looked at the preview, looks like lame humor\". I am usually weary of previews, they often misrepresent movies. So I went. It didn't take long for me to realize what a big mistake that was. After 15 minutes of jokes that fall flat because too big to not fail, I decided I have to get out of here. But I was in the middle, dead center of the theater, and I really hate to disturb other spectators. So I stayed another 15 minutes, until I just couldn't take it anymore. In retrospect, I think one of the problems with this movie is that it makes fun of a genius who is able to figure out what's going on by combining observation, knowledge and logic. It touches the very essence of what makes Sherlock Holmes so interesting and fascinating to most people. It tries to make Sherlock Holmes look like a fool. But everybody knows that Sherlock is anything but a fool."

Most of what you see these days is alright, competent, good enough that it's nice sometimes to see something so categorically awful - just to get the juices flowing.\n\nWill Ferrell is Sherlock Holmes and John C Reilly is John Watson and they ..... (sigh) .... Actually what are they doing? Moriarty threatens to kill the Queen so they ..... follow up on some leads, I guess. Blunder around in a series of ghastly, tedious, scenes and then mercifully it ends. Then (and I swear this is true) the staff at the cinema congratulate you for making it to the end.\n\nSo why is it so bad? Partially, it's because it has no idea what its core premise is. I wonder if it suffers from being rewritten multiple times since the initial idea with Sacha Baron Cohen. It's never sure whether its Holmes is a genius, a fraud or an idiot - so across the run time he's all three. It feels like the film should have had Watson as the genuine genius, happy for the credit to go to Holmes - but that went out the window when Reilly was cast and now there's no straight man to the pairing, just two idiots tramping from godawful slapstick scenes to witless parody of modern day via a spoof of the Downey Jnr/Jude Law films. It's chocked full of cameos, Steve Coogan, Hugh Laurie and Rob Brydon all of whom add nothing, no humour, no story... just characters coming and going and adding nothing. They do come of better than Kelly Macdonald though, whose cringeworthy version of Mrs Hudson is a particularly and at the end bafflingly, nadir.\n\nAt no point last year would I have believed that \"Sherlock Gnomes\" wouldn't be the worst adaptation of the character that I saw last year. \"Holmes and Watson\" not only topped that, it was the definitely the worst film I saw at all last year, certainly one the worst of the decade and, without hyperbole, indubitably of the worst of all time."

I think the duo did a great job giving the serious and intriguing series that so many of us have fallen in love with. I thought it was constantly funny and Will Ferrell brought a very heartily feel to the otherwise dark and impressive detective that is Sherlock Holmes. I was laughing several times during this movie and I was able to watch the whole thing without walking out. I had not even one single thought of leaving this movie. It was totally worth the money and if they made a sequel I would have no problem paying the money to see this again. When it comes out on DVD, I will definitely get it again to watch. I appreciate everyone else reviews to this movie but I definitely give it a way higher review than that! I give it a 7/10! I think you guys should give it a try too!!!"

What sucks the most is that the set is great, the costumes are good, the music is actually incredible, but the writers and the actors were all apparently horribly ill while writing this, because it is nothing but an absolutely horrible fever dream from start to... I'd say to finish, but my girlfriend and I walked out as soon as we hit the \"morgue scene.\"\n\nWill Ferrell and John C. Reilly were so funny in Step Brothers, because they played stupid versions of themselves. Here, Will Ferrell uses a downright offensive British accent, and the directors apparently thought that this would be humorous in itself? This is the only explanation for why anyone thought this movie was funny, because the \"jokes\" are certainly not funny.\n\nIt's like a bad SNL skit that went on for an hour and 30 minutes too long, because there is one joke the whole time, and it never lands; Holmes and Watson are stupid. This doesn't even remotely make sense, let alone make me laugh. I chuckled once. Ok, twice. But I got nothing more than a \"heh\" out. Otherwise, this is not even a film to be laughed at. As soon as Will Ferrell came on screen, I leaned over to my girlfriend and said \"Oh my God... is this going to happen the whole movie?\" I didn't finish it, but I'm pretty sure it did happen the whole movie. That's what I saw.\n\nHow many more times do I need to say it? I LOVE stupid Will Ferrell comedies! I love Step Brothers, Blades of Glory, Talladega Nights, etc., But this movie is uninspired and IN NO WAY IS IT FUNNY. Save your money. Or if you want to put your cash to better use, rip it into pieces, turn on your fireplace, and incinerate it."

Here, we're repeating it in case you missed it, only this time we'll make it louder, and spell it slower\" kind of humour.\n\nIn fact, Holmes & Watson doesn't even have crude or tasteless humour. Or any kind of humour. All it has is references, assuming that \"modern day references in a film that takes place in 1800's will have people laughing like crazy.\"\n\nWhich you will find plenty here. \"Let's make a joke about texting. Get it? It's late 1800's, so there are no cell phones yet, but we're joking about texting. Get it? Oh, now we'll joke about sexting. Har har har. Get it? Here comes a joke about Instagram. Oh, I'm dying from laughter here. Get it? Okay, now we're moving on to jokes about selfies.

The supposedly untouchable Ferrell spends most of the film wrestling with the English accent at the expense of any glimpse of humour. Old English satire is unforgivingly beyond him, even if the writing had afforded him any chance of making a funny. He simply resorts to the odd Ferrell-esque shriek which comes off as just desperate.

But I sought out this particular movie of theirs, because I had heard so many ghastly reviews about it labelling it as one of the worst comedies of all time, and I have a penchant for extreme cinematic disasters. So is the movie really all that bad? Well, there were a small handful of gags that did provoke some (very) mild titters from me, but apart from those moments, I did find the movie to be as bad as other have made it out to be. There are some additional attempts at humor in the movie that COULD have worked with better staging and execution, but they are badly botched by writer/director Etan Cohen and the cast. But most of the humor is so lazy, so familiar, and so predictable, that even the best direction and performances could not milk any positive reactions from an audience. I think an additional problem is that Sherlock Holmes has previously been done to death both seriously and comically that it would require a herculean effort to add new life to the character. All that Cohen can seem to do is stuff like make many modern-day references, showing a real desperateness that will be painfully evident to any viewers. Not the worst comedy I have seen, but it all the same sinks to a real low point in the history of Hollywood movie comedies."

You may see other reviewers on here denouncing the movie as mindless, plotless and crude, and they're actually not too far off the mark. As far as plot and moviemaking goes, this is no masterpiece. The real appeal of this movie is the hysterical comedy. There are some fantastic political references, some hilarious set pieces, and in general just great comedic moments. The reason most people detest this movie in my opinion is because they were expecting a Robert Downey Jr-esque take on Sherlock Holmes, in that the movie is serious, well-plotted and articulate. Well, what I say to these people is, you've literally got dozens of Sherlock Holmes films to watch for these qualities. What the director of this movie has done is thought outside the box a little, taken a vastly different take on Sherlock Holmes than the endless amount of filmmakers before this. This is a rollicking comedic ride, with the lack of plot more than compensated for by the consistent laughs that you get of it. People don't laugh enough anymore, and it is for this that this film is well worth the watch."

THIS MOVIE IS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE! YOU THINK I'M RAGING NOW? WHEN I LEFT THE FREAKING THEATER, I FELT LIKE BLOWING IT UP! THIS MOVIE IS HORRIBLE!\n\nWhat's the story? Detective Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson join forces to investigate a mysterious murder at Buckingham Palace. It seems like an open-and-shut case as all signs point to Professor James Moriarty, the criminal mastermind and longtime nemesis of the crime-solving duo. When new twists and clues begin to emerge, the world's greatest sleuth and his trusted assistant must now use their legendary wits and ingenious methods to catch the killer before the queen becomes the next victim.\n\nSo what's so terrible about this movie? EVERYTHING!!!!!- well, the worst aspect of this movie has GOT to be the HUMOR. Now, if you're the person who likes silly and mentally insane faces as well as dated pop culture references, then this movie is for you. If you don't appreciate those kind of jokes in your SHERLOCK HOLMES movie, then you're normal. Despite taking place in 1800s London, the things that pass on for comedy in this film is (and I'm not joking either) TAKING SELFIES WITH THE QUEEN. Not only does it make no sense because photography back then was absolute garbage, but it's just not funny. When I saw the trailers for this film, I legitimately thought it was gonna be funny! But it WASN'T! And that made me MAD! Another thing that really sucked about this film was the acting. Despite Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly being a great comedy duo, they were EXTREMELY UNFUNNY in this film. Like I said earlier, there's a ton of annoying and obnoxious pop culture references that aren't even funny in the film, and the duo are responsible for bringing in 85% of this messy dump. And you'd think that although there's all these unfunny jokes that there'd at least be 1 or 2 that legitimately worked, but you're wrong! NOTHING IN THIS FILM WAS FUNNY! In fact, the funniest part of the film was the MPAA screen after the film! So the funniest part of the film wasn't even IN it! MY GOD!\n\nIn conclusion, don't watch this movie. It's horrible in every way. Just don't watch this. There's much better movies that you can get tickets to, like Bumblebee and Aquaman. And apparently, this movie is so bad, even NETFLIX doesn't want it! THAT should be on the POSTER of this film! Don't waste your time and watch a good movie instead."

Whether you're left, right, or just don't care; watching something that steps away from politics would be refreshing and this movie sinks to the level of not so subtle jabs at political topics. Ferrel is a great comedian but this was just an attempt to put him back on our radars by appealing to trending \"hot button\" areas."

I don't care if you're Right/left/middle when it comes to politics...movies, especially comedy, is what people use to escape. An evening to just relax and have fun. This movie was used to poke fun with an agenda that some agree with and some don't agree with that had literally nothing to do with the plot or story line. Pathetic.\n\nMy favorite comedy duo has seriously let me down. This movie wasn't comedy, it was garbage."

        "review_detailed_main": "When you consider the chemistry we know Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly have based on their previous work together, it is almost an impressive feat to make a film this bad starring those two. I've seen some unfunny comedies in my time but it is hard to remember one as terrible as this. Absolutely nothing worked. I kept thinking to myself, what kind of screenwriter wrote this and actually thought it would be funny? How can you think picking up a child's turtle and throwing it as far as you can would ever be worthy of a laugh?\n\nWill Ferrell just can not make a good movie lately. He hasn't made a good one since 2010 with 'The Other Guys'. Considering he was undoubtedly the funniest actor working through the 2000s that is quite astonishing. What went so painfully wrong in his career? He doesn't seem to have the same enthusiasm he had back in the early days. Maybe his love of the industry has dissipated, but whatever the reason is he needs to either turn it around quickly or retire because he is seriously ruining his once epic legacy.\n\nEven if 'Holmes and Watson' wasn't going to be funny they could have at least put a mildly interesting mystery case into the movie to keep it watchable. But nope, apparently not. A 5-year-old could have come up with the plot they chose to use in this film. I'm not exaggerating when I say this was close to the longest 90 minutes of my life. I have never wanted a film to be over so badly.\n\nWere the leads hampered by a PG-13 rating? Possibly, yet that is still no excuse to not even have one funny gag (or even line) in the entire movie. What exactly attracted the two lead actors to take on this project I wonder? Then, as if the film couldn't get any worse, in the last quarter of the runtime they randomly decide to start throwing in some subtle (by which I mean not subtle at all) attacks on President Trump (don't even worry about the film being sets in the 1900s). It is very rare that I ever give a film a rating as low as 2, but there was simply no other option for this abomination. Stay well clear of this one."

        "review_detailed_main": "Holmes and Watson does not offer high hopes going into it. The film currently sits at 6% on Rotten Tomatoes and at one point had the dreadful honour of being completely at 0%.\n\nWatching it confirms the fact that it is entirely rotten. Which is an absolute shame. Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly are comedy greats and usually together their humour is multiplied...but clearly the problem lies in the script and direction.\n\nBoth duties fall under Etan Cohen, not to be confused with Joel and Ethan Coen and definitely not to be confused with Joel Cohen, writer of Garfield. Of all the Coen/Cohen's in Hollywood, we've found our Paul W.S. Anderson equivalent.\n\nPreviously the filmmaker behind Ferrell vehicle Get Hard, it's amazing to see someone get worse, particularly this worse.\n\nHolmes and Watson has all the trappings of a Sherlock Holmes story and all the trappings of a potentially great comedy handled with the grace of the Running of the Bulls through the World's Largest China Shop. So inefficient and unfunny, it's definitely not great when you look around at the silence caused by the severe lack of jokes in the minutes before the opening credits (except one person in my screening, but there's always gonna be one intergalactic alien trying to fit in as a secret human).\n\nThe film is severely bland and lacking, full of choices that seem completely misguided. Ferrell decides to put on a strange accent for Holmes that doesn't work at all, and Reilly's Watson is overly and unfunnily violent, yet these are choices never dissuaded by the director, which is concerning.\n\nHolmes and Watson has a story, if you can believe that, one where Moriarty (played by the criminally underused and probably overpaid Ralph Fiennes) has a presence, but is harshly pushed to the side in favour of an invisible antagonist you can figure out by spoilers by billing.\n\nOn a completely unrelated note, Kelly MacDonald is in this movie and she continues to be brilliant and brilliantly Scottish in the things that she makes, and while her character is there for a bunch of anachronistic jokes and pushed to the side too, when her arc thins out it feels like it was a good idea made sour at the drop of a hat.\n\nSomewhere, in this movie, there is a joke. I guess. I hope. Much like A Million Ways to Die in the West and other films of that ilk, the only thing that made me laugh was a heavy reference to a much better film that had humour in the fact it took you completely out of the movie you were watching, because it's safer.\n\nHolmes and Watson is a hollow entry to round out the year of comedy movies. Alan Menken and Glenn Slater offer the second closest thing to a joke with an original song that's a parody of their work that's nothing compared to Vanelope's \"I want\" song parody in Ralph Breaks the Internet.\n\nEverything in this movie has been done better and bigger and funnier and smarter. Hell, even the overrated later episodes of BBC's Sherlock itself parodies itself better, even down to a drunk Sherlock scene that doesn't have to stoop so low as this movie does for an attempt of a laugh.\n\nIt joins a bunch of movies I would give no stars to if I could, but the sheer fact that somehow this movie made it from conception to the silver screen is some sort of commendation. Plus it has a Titanic joke that makes no sense, but it makes more sense than the entirety of the film.\n\nAnd before you say something, yes, the majority of jokes in this film are indeed out of time. And out of this world.\n\nWhich is not a good thing.\n\n1 Star."

So, we went, and we laughed, and we got the jokes, and we got the sarcasm, we even got the \"TRUMPed\" remark, and we laughed again. The easily offended may walk away with their noses in the air, but we got the humour, and we laughed again! Needless to say, we're still Ferrell, Reilly, Holmes and Watson fans!\n\nI must say, Ralph Fiennes plays his part so well! The accent he uses stunned me; I never expected that accent to come out of his mouth. I loved it! :D Well done, Mr Fiennes!\n\nAnd Kelly Macdonald!! Good call for Mrs Hudson. It was weird hearing her real accent, lol, but she was great, too!\n\nHugh Laurie, Pam Ferris, Rob Brydon, and Steve Coogan...

It won't win awards, but it will make you smile if you are into that kind of stuff.

        "review_title": "A Comedic Take on the Iconic Detective Duo with Mixed Results",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Holmes & Watson,\" directed by Etan Cohen, is a comedic interpretation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous detective characters, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson. While the film attempts to blend classic Holmesian mystery with modern humor, the result is a hit-and-miss affair that struggles to find a consistent comedic rhythm.\n\nWill Ferrell and John C. Reilly star as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson, respectively. The duo, known for their chemistry in previous collaborations, bring their signature style of humor to these iconic characters. Ferrell's over-the-top portrayal of Holmes and Reilly's bumbling yet earnest Watson are clearly intended to be parodic, but the execution often falls flat, missing the mark in terms of comedic timing and effectiveness.\n\nThe film's premise, which involves Holmes and Watson solving a murder mystery to prevent the assassination of Queen Victoria, sets the stage for a series of comedic escapades. However, the humor is largely reliant on anachronistic gags, slapstick comedy, and modern pop culture references that feel out of place in the Victorian setting. While some jokes land successfully, many others feel forced or overly silly, lacking the wit or subtlety that might have made them more effective.\n\nSupporting performances by actors such as Ralph Fiennes as Moriarty and Rebecca Hall as Dr. Grace Hart add some charm to the film, but their talents are underutilized. The characters are not given enough development or screen time to make a significant impact on the story or the comedy.\n\nVisually, the film does a commendable job of recreating Victorian London, with detailed set designs and costumes that capture the era's essence. However, these aesthetic accomplishments are often overshadowed by the film's inconsistent tone and humor.\n\nThe screenplay struggles to balance the homage to Sherlock Holmes with its modern comedic aspirations. While the idea of a humorous take on the detective genre is promising, the film's execution lacks the cleverness and creativity needed to make it stand out.\n\nOne of the positive aspects of \"Holmes & Watson\" is its willingness to be unabashedly silly and lighthearted. The film doesn't take itself too seriously, which may appeal to viewers looking for a simple, escapist comedy. However, for fans of Sherlock Holmes or those expecting a more intelligent or witty interpretation of the characters, the film may be disappointing.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Holmes & Watson\" is a film with a novel concept but uneven execution. It's a comedy that swings for the fences but often misses, resulting in a final product that is a mixed bag of laughs and misses. It earns a 5 out of 10 for its effort to bring a new comedic twist to the world of Sherlock Holmes, even if it doesn't fully succeed in delivering a consistently entertaining or memorable film."

I mean the fact that they fell into the same type of roles and antics as Talladega Nights made it unoriginal. Add to that an odd musical number out of nowhere and it kind of leaned toward flop status.\n\nI'd say that what saved it were the frequent references to current popular issues such as selfies, women's equality, and our current president. They worked those jokes in there in an overt yet clever way such that you couldn't help but laugh. The overall product lacked distinguishability but Ferrell and Reilly were silly enough to bring about just enough laughs to prevent a fail."

Probably due to the politically INCORRECT jokes about feminism, trump, childviolence etc etc. But all the (possibly) offensive jokes are being done with lots of originality, tact and charming wit.\n\nThe other reason why it has such a low Imdb rating could be due to the wrath of the (older adult) english speaking audience who cant stand to watch 2 American actors slaughter every bit of sacredness of the english heritage of Sherlock Holmes. And that sacredness of Sherlock Holmes DOES GET SLAUGHTERED. Bravo! It needed to be slaughtered, to make a fresh new start. To bring back new life to this Sherlock Holmes detective genre, which was nearly bled to death with boring remakes.\n\nIt is an actor's movie, and I mean that very complimentary. However silly everything may get, there is still lots and lots of good acting to be enjoyed by leading and suporting roles. Ralph Fiennes has a great suporting role and so do many other great English actors.\n\nEverything is pretty farcical, but executed with great attention for detail and with marvellous jokes and good acting.Yes, some of the jokes are obnoxious (vomitting, childviolence) but it is done in a very funny way and the obnoxious jokes are only used sparsely. I cant see any fault with this refreshing slaughter of the \"sacred\" Englishness of Sherlock Holmes."

Reilly is a very good actor who for some reason keeps teaming up with the over-the-hill Farrell. The result was this unfunny, irritating mess. The only good thing I can say about this movie was it was only around an hour and a half. Mind you, an hour and a half too long but still, a short movie by today's standards. This is only the second review I've felt compelled to write but this movie was so bad I just had to tell someone. If I had it to do over again I'd watch \"Planes, Trains, and Automobiles\" for maybe the tenth time.

Reilly for them to sign onto this movie???\" and \"Did we really just blow $16 to recline comfortably and absolutely no other reason?\" These questions and many others are what actually made this movie entertaining to us.\n\nI laughed exactly one time at a 3 second portion of the autopsy scene. So 0.000555% of the movie was 10 stars, so it has that going for it.\n\nAll in all, go in drunk, bring some beers with you, expect absolutely nothing funny (except that 0.000555%) and look at your phones for the entirety of the movie and you have yourself a winner!"

In it Holmes is a complete narcissist who believes himself to be a great detective because the press says he is. And Watson is reduced to singing Holmes' praises and being abused by him at all turns.\n\nIf you've seen their back and forth in other movies you won't be surprised here. If you haven't and this is your first time, then prepare to be disappointed because it's just not funny.\n\nTo put this into perspective the producers knew this was a dog and wanted to sell it to Netflix because they tend to jump at any chance to get original movies. Netflix turned them down because they felt it was too stupid. Netflix turned them down. This is the same company that produced and showed Adam Sandler's \"The Ridiculous 6\". A movie so bad that I don't know anybody who actually likes it. When the low bar for what you'll take and what you won't is an Adam Sandler movie then you know it's time to pack it in."

Then I read that all the reviews said it was awful and I was surprised because Farrell and Reilly are usually good together.\n\nAfter seeing it I can say that it's not nearly as terrible as people say. I don't get what all the hate was about. Sure, there are some pretty dumb moments, but I was mostly laughing throughout. It's basically a silly/slapstick comedy, which is clear from the trailer.\n\nAlso, I didn't see any of the \"sloppy editing\" and \"shots out of focus\" that's listed in the trivia, and I don't get why people would have walked out en masse as claimed. I've seen far worse.\n\nAll in all I don't know what people were expecting, but if you liked Farrell and Reilly together previously then you'll likely enjoy this as well. It's not quite as good as Step Brothers, but I definitely did not regret watching it."

        "review_detailed_main": "There are some amusing moments but, on the whole, 'Holmes & Watson (2018)' is just totally average. It's not as bad as most reviews purport it to be but it's nowhere near as funny or generally accomplished as you'd expect from a reuniting of Ferrell and Reilly - who are both often hilarious in real life and made the excellent 'Step-brothers (2010)' together. The film is not as much a parody as it is a cash-in on the relatively recently lapsed copyright associated with the Sherlock Holmes character and his earliest of stories, making for a strange missed opportunity when it comes to where the laughs are (supposedly) coming from. The piece also leaves something to be desired in terms of its story - in particular, the central 'mystery' - and its character arcs, the latter of which are mostly rushed through in a bizarre (and lazy) musical moment towards the finale. I didn't necessarily dislike the experience while it was occurring, but it's almost instantly forgettable and the handful of successful jokes don't exactly make you howl, either. 5/10"

I felt similar when I saw the depiction of Bruce Lee in Once upon a time in America. And I'm not talking about how he fought or how he looked, but the way he was depicted. Arrogant is one thing (he may or may not have been like this or close to that), but the fact he was made to look as though he wasn't smart (to put it mildly).\n\nHaving said all that, there is more to OuaTiH, something that can hardly be applied here. Because you have quite the silly and really quite questionable depiction of two beloved figures. Not because the filmmakers don't like them, but because they wanted to do something different.\n\nAnd boy is this different. Predictable still and quite the rude humor and a bit dull for some for sure. It's tough to see merits, like the amount of good actors involved in this in smaller roles. You may or may not care, but if you don't adjust yourself into what is going down with this movie, you will have the worst time ...."

The boys meet American doctor Grace Hart (Rebecca Hall) and her simpleton travel companion Millicent (Lauren Lapkus). Mrs. Martha Hudson (Kelly Macdonald) is the boys' very inappropriate housekeeper.\n\nThis is aggressively unfunny. There is a central problem. Holmes is both super smart and super moronic. In Pink Panther, Clouseau stumbles his way into solving his cases. That's not the case here. Holmes is actually smart and solves his cases deductively. He's also a complete idiot and those two clash at the same time in the same scenes. It's hella confusing. It never comes to solving that central problem. As for the comedy, there is only one funny line in the whole movie. \" I'm actually more taken with the mystery. It's a whodunnit and not necessarily a solvable one. It is however a definable one with specific suspects. So the mystery is better than the comedy and that's not a good thing for this movie. These two are really struggling in this one."
