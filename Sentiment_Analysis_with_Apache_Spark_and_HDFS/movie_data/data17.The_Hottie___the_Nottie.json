And to think, crew people actually had to get out of bed in the morning and waste gas driving to the studio to make this movie. A waste of time, money and effort. The only thing NOT wasted here was talent, since no talent was used in the making of this stinker. Is Paris so broke that she has to stoop this low to get some cash. Offering to water my lawn would garner Paris more respect in the public arena than what she did on screen here. I hope the studio didn't spend more than $50 on the script. If they paid more, they got ripped off."

        "review_detailed_main": "OK, I'm not going to bash this film based on Paris Hilton, I admit, I don't like the girl, but I'm not going to base my comment on that alone, I think it's unfair. A lot of people are giving this movie a one just because of Paris without even seeing the movie, it gets a bit annoying. But I don't know why, I think I was just in a mood for one of those awful films that just leave a bad taste in your mouth, I think every once in a while, we need to see something like that. Now the problem with The Hottie and the Nottie, besides it's stupid title? The story, beyond predictable and hypocritical, along with the acting... it's like they just took people off the street who had no credibility to be in a film. I love how Paris Hilton isn't even the main character and yet she is first billed, you know that she paid good money for that or wouldn't be in it, big woop, her as an innocent charity loving girl, that's believable.\n\nNate Cooper is a man that just can't seem to move on in life, after 20 years he returns to his home town looking for his first grade crush, Cristabel. She's still around making men drool, but she won't go for him unless he can hook her ugly friend, June, up with a guy as well. June has bad teeth, bad skin, bad nails, bad hair, just all in all, it's bad, so Nate does everything he can to get June a guy, but it's more difficult than he could ever expect, until he finds out that love isn't everything he thought it might be.\n\nThe script is predictable, stupid, could've been written by a teenager and was very hypocritical, which you will see what I mean if you watch this movie. Now I know that they were just trying to get a big name, but come on... Paris Hilton? I actually had an open mind and just thought to give the movie a shot, but she just is such a horrible actress, like beyond horrible, I'm not just saying that because of who she is, just I know you'll believe me. This is a movie that really shouldn't have been made or if Hollywood wanted it so much, get different people, please, before they do something like cast Paris... never mind. Stay away from this movie at any costs.\n\n1/10"

Gary busey bad (The hottie and the nottie). i hated it but my sister loved it, (granted she is 12 and has down syndrome (no lie)). the fact that this movie also tries to portray a message is even worse, because i wasn't sure what it was until i did some reading.... this is perfect grounds why IMDb needs a 0/10"

She even believes her award from Harvard is something good!\n\nSome people learn they don't have the skills to be in the business after the first flop, or at least after the second bomb. Hilton however is obviously too blinded by her bedazzled sunglasses and purse to be able to recognize she has been in FOUR of the worst movies of all time!"

        "review_detailed_main": "It's obvious a movie that's sole claim to fame is that it stars Paris Hilton is not going to be a masterpiece. In fact, it seems every movie Paris Hilton stars in ends up being a horrible mess, and this is no exception. The Hottie and the Nottie...let's just think about what a stupid and conceited title that is. When Paris Hilton was offered the role as \"The Hottie\" she should have turned it down, not just because the script felt like it was written by a 10 year old, but because she is playing \"The Hottie\". That sounds so conceited, especially since Paris Hilton isn't all she seems to think she is. The title is also stupid, and sounds about as mature as the actual script is, which is the maturity you might find in an elementary school bathroom.\n\nNate Cooper (Joel Moore, who seems to be a mixture of John Heder and Mike White) is dumped by his girlfriend and decides to go to Los Angeles to find and date Christabelle Abbot (Paris Hilton), the girl he was attracted to in the first grade. Christabelle is apparently so attractive that every time she goes jogging, all males stop their activities to stare at her mouth agape. He ends up becoming friends again with her, but she can't go out with him because she made a pact with her not so attractive best friend June Phigg (Christina Lakin). Nate tries to set up guys with June to get with Christabelle. As June begins to get procedures done to her to make her less ugly, Nate begins to become more attracted to her.\n\nI believe earlier I said that June Phigg was not so attractive. Well that's an understatement. The make-up people made the normally attractive Christina Lakin as nasty looking as possible, with black and green teeth stubs, a balding head, and a terrible case of halitosis. Several times I had to turn away from the screen when they would base the humor around June's hideousness, because I felt like I was going to throw up.\n\nThe script is bad, unfunny, and along with that shows no development in character whatsoever. Nate begins to fall for June, but not until after she becomes pretty. Before that, he shows no interest in her at all. He didn't even like her personality, he cares simply about looks, so if any of the female characters were like him, they would be running for the hills from this doofy looking guy. In a romantic comedy (I guess you can call this that, despite the lack of romance or humor), you'd expect there to be someone looking for their true love, but not here. It's all about looks in this superficial waste of time. Also Nate is always lying to make himself seem hipper, and ends up seeming like an unfunny version of Seinfeld's George Costanza, mixed with a lobotomized Napolean Dynamite. The plot also makes little sense. This guy had a crush on this girl in the first grade, then moved. Who the heck keeps a crush on a girl he only knew for less than a year, that barely even knew him. He thinks back to his time in elementary school and really wants to see her...she was a little girl. It's almost pedophilic.\n\nThe acting is all around bad. Joel Moore is by far the best actor, and he doesn't even deserve to play extras in community theater. Paris Hilton has an annoying flirtatious delivery of each line, and I don't think that she was told to act this way, this is just her natural acting abilities. Christina Lakin also has very poor acting abilities, but also didn't really need any. Her role is to be there and look as nasty as possible, then later to look pretty. She has few lines in comparison to the two untalented leads, especially Joel who spouts out stupid lines every 2 seconds. The back-up cast is also terrible, including one guy, who plays Nate's stupid friend, who thinks he is so cool, he's credited as The Greg Wilson, after all it's super cool to put a \"The\" in front of your name.\n\nI watched this movie, because I thought it might be one of those \"So bad it's funny\" experiences that you enjoy laughing about later with friends. This is not one of those movies. It's just bad, no wait, it's just terrible. The movie's sense of the humor is so bad, it actually almost made me feel sorry for the writer. If she thought what she was writing was good at all, then she is either completely delusional, or she might have a mental problem. I hope Heidi Ferrer, writer of this film, along with a few episodes of Dawson's Creek, will write a masterpiece and just leave this as a blemish on her booming career, but in the future not force contrived slop on the viewing public with any more screenplays like this.\n\nNow, onto the positives. The camera direction wasn't bad. It was kind of flashy and nice looking at times. The beach this was shot at looked like it would be nice to go for a dip at. I guess that counts as a positive. Paris Hilton plays a terrible character, but at least she's a kind hearted one. And that's all I can think of.\n\nIf you can't tell, I hated this movie with a passion, and from it's current ranking of number 10 in the bottom 100, I can tell other people share my views on this cinematic massacre.\n\nMy rating: BOMB out of ****. 88 mins. PG-13 for language, and crude humor."

If Judge (Michael) Sauer had the power to indict her for bad acting, singing, and just plain performing overall, he'd lock the door, throw the key away, and make sure this nottie \u0096 with an Executive Producer credit, of all things! \u0096 never got out. I ragged on Madonna for her performance in Swept Away; compared side-by-side to H&N, she's Oscar material! If this aural and visual carnage never makes it to DVD or home video (trust me, it will), it'll be too soon."

No. But it is a watchable, nice film, and she isn't bad at all in her role.\n\nIt is actually a story about a guy who loves a hot girl (Hilton), and then gets slowly involved with her unattractive friend (Christine Lakin). It is a story of surpassing the physical stuff and loving someone for their inner personality. And it is not original, nor genius, but it is a warm and funny film. I'm certain that if some actress who is not famous for being famous is playing Hilton's role, that this movie would have like 5.0 average rating instead of 1.9. People need to stop bashing just for the sake of bashing. Bottoms Up was bad. This one is not. I would actually recommend it for a casual and relaxing afternoon watching."

The story is a little weak and in some places silly, but this movie came from Hollywood so there is nothing unusual in this type of movie.\n\nThere is a few cringe moments in the movie which some people may not like but still it wouldn't drop the movies ratings by much.\n\nIn my opinion this movie gets an extremely low rating because people don't like Paris Hilton. They don't like her \"party girl\" life style and she comes across as shallow. In this movie she plays a character that is the opposite of her real life persona.\n\nSo if you don't have a problem, dislike, jealousy, envy, etc with Paris Hilton you should enjoy this movie. If you still don't like it and you want to rate it then try watching \"birdemic\" or \"going overboard\" first as these should be the standard for judging all one star movies.\n\nSo in summary; this is a below average romantic comedy. Don't expect much from this movie but I think you will enjoy it if you can see through the Paris Hilton media negativity."

She's not the best actress but she's in no way as bad as some others out there. E.g some of these found footage films e.g Blair witch (which amazingly scored way higher than this) Overall the film had some funny moments and you get to know each character's personality and find yourself wanting the ugly girl to get a date."

I think she's matured from a tabloid It Girl heiress to a mature young woman who knows the value of her name, and is focused on building her brand. She is every bit the businesswoman that Kim Kardashian-West only wishes she could be. This movie is an artifact of that transitioning period.\n\nI therefore consider myself to be more unprejudiced and open-minded than others here. (Hindsight may also be a factor; I am reviewing this in 2018.)\n\nWhat we have here is a lighthearted, brainless adolescent romp. Joel David Moore is terrific as the lead. And Paris' acting isn't terrible, it's just fine in fact (a significant improvement over her Bottoms Up performance). An enjoyably trashy B-movie. It was after all shot in 5 weeks with a $9million budget and produced by Paris Hilton Entertainment.\n\nAt worst it's corny and very average; at best it has a little heart and charm.

Our \"hero\", Nate, had a crush on a girl named Cristabel in the first grade, then his family moved across the country and he never saw her again. Now an \"adult\" (in years anyway), he's never gotten over this. He can't stay in a relationship, or even hold a job, because he can't get Cristabel off his mind. Rather than see a therapist, he decides he has seek her out. Since Google doesn't exist in this universe, he hops in his car (which definitely couldn't have made the trip) and drives across the country to find his first grade friend, Arno. It turns out Arno has also been obsessed with Cristabel since the first grade (what are the odds?). In fact, he's been stalking her his entire life, and has compiled a full dossier with the help of his mother, with whom he lives and has a very creepy relationship. Like Nate, he appears not to have a job. In spite of his lifelong obsession, he seems to have no personal interest in Cristabel, and has apparently just been waiting around for Nate to return so he can help him win her over.\n\nHe re-introduces himself to Cristabel, the eponymous \"hottie\", by tackling her while she's jogging. Rather than macing him like any sane person, she somehow charmed by him and says the only reason she won't date him is not that he's unattractive, broke, and generally has nothing going for him, but rather that she has to find someone for her \"nottie\" friend, June, who has also been around since the first grade, and the stakes are set.\n\nIn their quest to solve this problem, Nate and Arno will establish themselves to be truly loathsome individuals, but we're meant to ignore that because of the inherent nobility of first grade crushes.\n\nIf you've ever seen a rom-com, it won't be a spoiler to tell you that Nate encounters a rival who is everything he isn't: good looking, wealthy, athletic, charming, and talented. The thing is, this guy is also at least a good a person as Nate, probably better.\n\nAnyway, yada, yada, you see the end coming a mile away, and we learn some valuable lessons about how important it is for women to be as attractive as possible if they ever want to be happy, and how important it is for men to, um...., have a pulse, I guess."

I mean nobody criticises Robert De Niro for Little Fockers because he has starred in films like Taxi Driver.\n\nAnyway, this film had quite a few plot twists that I didn't expect and the end result was pretty satisfying. It is designed for a certain type of audience but I for one really enjoyed it. I would even go as far to say that it is in my top 10 favourite films.

The production value was surprisingly high for what i consider a B movie. A film such as BLOOD FREAK is far worse, yet receives a 4.3 rating. HOW? I'm not here to lambaste this other film, but hope it serves as an example of the unjust ranking system. Christine Lakin's performance more than makes up for Hilton's wooden performance (does she even have expressions?) I'd say anyone can enjoy a mindless romp with this film. Not every movie need be some profound meditation on life. This film is entertaining at best and escapism at worst. While this movie isn't the greatest, it wouldn't kill you to see it. Overall Rating: 4, Mediocre"

No wonder it received a Razzie Award. I was sitting comfortable in my sofa and pressed the button. The movie started. After the first 2 minutes, I was wondering how many neurons i had lost. The opening showed the great \"diva\" Paris Shiton gathering all men's views. It was pathetic and totally unrealistic. I bet 10 $ that I would resist more than 20 minutes. After 10 hard to digest minutes that included horrible acting and scenes I was on the right way of getting something from this garbage: 10 $. The movie reached the climax when the main character, an unbelievably bad actor it i can't call him like this, went to a gym in an attempt to \"conquer\" the nottie. Suddenly, i heard my neurons screaming, i grabbed the 10 $ banknote and threw it to my friend. I closed the TV as fast as i could hopping that a few of my nerve cells have escaped. In conclusion, I would rather lose all my money than having to watch the WORST MOVIE EVER CREATED. 1/10 - I could not find a lower mark. Actually the movie deserves 0."

        "review_detailed_main": "First off, I have seen a lot of films in my time and this is nowhere near the bottom 100 in acting, plot, humour, direction, wardrobe, makeup, or anything else. Unfortunately, the sheer volume of votes by people who haven't bothered to see it means this review will probably get lost and ignored, but I think this film deserves better than it's getting so I'll try anyway.\n\nI won't go over the plot because that can be seen above, except to say that its the usual love story sort of thing. I don't think the filmmakers were going for anything mindblowingly original here, nor is that what we end up with. What we do get is a sweet and lighthearted film that takes an everyday setting and throws in some fairly normal, although exaggerated, characters and builds a simple little interwoven romance around them. From the outset it's not difficult to predict what will happen in the end, the acting of Paris Hilton isn't what I'd call good but it's by no means teeth grindingly bad either, and the characters (especially June and Johann) have been taken to the extreme in terms of looks and talent respectively but that is no bad thing. The aforementioned things do prevent you from getting fully immersed in things and you're constantly reminded that you're watching a film, but I think thats okay for something that only wants to entertain you for a while. The other actors were good, it was shot well, and the script and narrative, however simple, were well matched with the cinematography and general feel of the film. The film made me laugh several times (which is more than I can say for most recent comedies), the interactions between characters was handled well and the ancillary characters neither infringed upon the main ones or felt pointlessly lost in the background, and the direction, whilst not world class, was better than I've seen in a lot of films and no shots felt out of place or jarred you from the flow of the film.\n\nOverall, I found this film entertaining despite not being immersive or 'deep' and, since I believe that was the intention, I can't say the filmmakers failed here. I don't feel that I've wasted my time, I had no trouble watching this all the way through, and although I probably wouldn't watch it again for several years I thought it managed to lift itself above the usual standard of Hollywood films these days, if only a little. If you cant stand Paris Hilton, if you want to tax your brain, or if you want a film to get lost in then this is one to avoid, however if you've got some time to fill and you want to see something that wont weigh you down then you can't really go wrong with this one. There's far, far worse out there, trust me."

I can't stand her myself, and she is not much of an actor.\n\nBut I have seen many movies that are way worse than this. I think right now this one is rated as the 53rd worst movie of all time. There has to be at least 100-200 more movies worse than this. Probably many more."

But I just don't think this movie deserves just a 1,6 rating. Watch the movie expecting light entertainment, and obvious humor. Don't watch it if you're expecting to do some deep philosophizing on the subtext of the plot. I just don't see what is so much better about a movie like American Pie for instance, and this one. Same genre, same easy laughs, same crap really. But it's occasionally quite relaxing to watch a movie that you don't really have a to think about all that much."

Personally I believe that if I were to be able to remake this film some 40 years for now on an epic movie scale in the vein of Michael Bay or Steven Spielberg, for everyone to see, this is how I would do it. Without a doubt, Paris Hilton would be, and should have played, the role of Nottie if this movie was going to garner any sort of attention in the mass media. That's the kind of roles she should be getting since she thinks everyone should take her seriously as both actress and a Hilton. But obviously, Paris doesn't seem to actually want to get good roles and just continue to play the part of the silly dumb bimbo who somehow plays a major role in movies as lame as this. Did National Lampoon make this movie? It almost feels like it, or all those lame American Pie continuations. Paris instead yucks it up with a bunch of other actors who really did this for a quick couple of dollars to pay the rent, perhaps. I certainly didn't find this movie any funny, nor interesting, and it was my younger sister who rented it to see how messed up it really is.\n\nAfter sitting through halfway, it got so much waves of quiet awkwardness and scorn from everyone that we ultimately returned it pretending it was scratched and unplayable on our DVD - replacing it with a movie, actually, no, instead we got a DVD containing a collection of 20 random infamous fight scenes from movies over the years: Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee, Brad Pitt, Rowdy Roddy Piper (\"PUT ON THE GLASSES!\"). It definitely soothed the soul and made us forget we ever watched a film like this ever. It's not as eyebleedingly bad as Uwe Boll, but it certainly ranks among next to it.\n\nUnless you like cruelty to people who aren't as distinguished as you are, or stress the fact that \"Girls, if you want to look good for your Boy, surgery is the best way to go,\" which is terrible to even consider even as a moral, then go ahead and see this movie.\n\nBut if you're smart, go see Star Wars or something again."

She looks less like a truly ugly person than like someone suffering from drug addiction.

        "review_detailed_main": "This film essentially begins with a young school boy by the name of \"Nate Cooper\" (Caleb Guss) becoming quite smitten with a new classmate named \"Cristabel Abbot\" (Karley Scott Collins). The scene then shifts to many years later with the adult \"Nate Cooper\" (now played by Joel David Moore) having a serious breakup with his girlfriend \"Jane\" (Kathryn Fiore) and deciding to travel all the way from Maine to Los Angeles to pursue the one girl he has truly loved ever since the first grade: \"Cristabel Abbot\" (now played by Paris Hilton). However, he soon discovers that, because Cristabel is so beautiful, that there are a great number of other guys who are also quite interested as well. Not only that, but making matters even more difficult is the fact that Cristabel has a best friend since childhood named \"June Phigg\" (Christine Lakin) who acts as her first line of defense and successfully chases away all suitors with her unbelievable ugliness. So, to remedy that problem, Nate does everything he can to find someone to date June in order to spend more time with Cristabel. The problem is that this is much harder than he realizes. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that, even though the overall plot was quite predictable, this film had a certain amount of potential if handled correctly. Unfortunately, the director (Tom Putnam) obviously didn't know what he was doing as he took a rather simple story and totally ruined it by making June much too ugly and disgusting to be even remotely entertaining. That being said, although I cannot fathom what his thought processes were when making this movie, what I can say is that I was pretty much repulsed by it. In short, the only reason I didn't rate this film even lower is because of a few scenes involving Nate's best friend \"Arno Blount\" (Greg Romero Wilson) which were quite funny. But other than that, this movie was an abject failure and I would not recommend it to anybody."

The music is awful, it is enough to make you want to cover your ears because it is sheer torture, while the direction is non existent. The script is one of The Hottie and the Nottie's worst assets, it is terrible. I didn't laugh once, actually I was groaning most of the time, while the story(basically an ugly duckling turned beautiful twist) is completely predictable and badly developed so you didn't care for the characters and their situations. I almost forgot to mention how hypocritical this movie is, I thought I'd seen the last of hypocrisy with The Hannah Montana movie, but the hypocrisy here makes the hypocrisy in that film seem subtle. The acting is a joke. As dire as Paris Hilton was, she cannot act if her life depended on it, she isn't entirely to blame, none of her co-stars were any good either. All in all, terrible and dare I say embarrassing. 1/10 Bethany Cox"

Christine Lakin is great and for anyone who still remembers her from her start in Step by Step should see this movie. Overall the movie is worth the time you spend watching it and it is definitely better that the current overall rating of 1.5"

I understand that she didn't do anything to make herself popular or shed her party girl image. And I see how people would say she's a bad role model for our youth based on her lifestyle. But none of that really should be taken into account when it comes to her acting. She is after all playing a character in this movie and not herself.\n\nBut on the other hand, she proved that she's not much of an actress and this movie was a vanity project from the start.\n\nA vanity project is something that is done for the express purpose of making somebody feel better. It plays on their status as a famous person or more importantly plays up who they are. A good example of this, other than this movie of course, is Mariah Carey's \"Glitter\" which is a semi-fictional version of her rise to fame. That too was rightfully trashed by the critics who saw right through it.\n\nIn this movie Paris Hilton plays the titular \"Hottie\" by the name of \"Cristabelle\". That's the movie's first mistake. Paris Hilton isn't that hot although if you like cocaine thin vapid airheads then I guess she's your type. But most people will admit she isn't that pretty. She has an ugly friend, the so called \"Nottie\" named \"June\" and played by the much prettier Christine Lakin in heavy ugly makeup.\n\nEnter Nate who has been in love with Cristabelle since elementary school and finds out she's single. The problem is Cristabelle won't go out with anybody until June has a date. Well what's a guy like Nate supposed to do? He'll lie, cheat and do everything in his power to get June a date just so that he can be with Cristabelle. Isn't that sweet? He tries to bribe people, hypnotize them and even convinces a handsome plastic surgeon to give her free facial work to improve her odds. What a guy.\n\nIn the end, when June has been made pretty Nate suddenly realizes that he's in love with her and they wind up together. So nice isn't it? Or at least it would be if you really thought what this movie was telling people. That is, if you're not \"perfect\" like Cristabelle then you need to literally change your face so that people can fall in love with you. It's not what's inside that counts, it's how beautiful you look on the outside.\n\nAnd that is one of the worst messages you can send anybody.\n\nThankfully this did so poorly that nobody ever asked Paris to do another movie."

But, in my only defense, I only watched this trash for the How Did This Get Made? podcast.\n\nI don't think I have the patience or desire to waste too much time on how many, many, many things were wrong with this film, but suffice to say it was horribly shot with far too many unnecessary closeups, horribly written, cliched, predictable and once again shows how paper thin Paris Hilton is, inside/out. But, I will give this movie two positives, just to be fair.\n\nDespite his awful character, actor Joel David Moore *was* trying throughout and the music wasn't that bad. In fact, I kinda liked some of the catchy music. But, playtime is over.\n\nThe movie's about a shallow guy's attempt to keep a 1st grade crush alive many, many years later, but must fake like/help her purposely hideous friend so he can get laid. And you will know, from minute one, where this is headed.\n\nParis is such a distraction. From being super plastic, to existent acting to very non-existent acting, to just trying to flirt with the camera, her ever presence onscreen makes me cringe. But, she's not the only dark stain here. It's the exact same I've said about her as the \"comedy.\" This is supposed to be a comedy and I laughed not once.\n\nFine. I must be honest. I smirked once for sure, maybe twice. I never laughed. None of this was funny. I see where there's supposed to be jokes. I just never once saw one land.\n\nIf you're a fan of How Did This Get Made? and you want to see this like I did for their episode devoted to this trash, you might be pleased to know as of, at least, 1/15/20, this movie is available for free for Amazon Prime members. I'm just relieved I didn't contribute a single cent to these bad filmmakers.\n\n***\n\nFinal thoughts: Did secondary character Arno played by Greg Romero Wilson really make them list him as \"The Greg Wilson?\" Okay, fine, that might be the one joke that landed."

        "review_detailed_main": "Nate Cooper (Joel David Moore) is an unemployed failure who's just been dumped (and nearly killed) by his latest girlfriend. Realizing his heart has never been with any of his girlfriends, Nate heads to Los Angeles to find his childhood crush, Cristobel (Paris Hilton), his childhood best friend, Arno (The Greg Wilson), has been living with his mother and keeping tabs on Cristobel with an extensive filing system and reveals Cristobel still maintains a friendship with June Phigg (Christine Lakin) her ugly best friend or as Arno calls her the \"Nottie\" to Cristobels \"Hottie\". When Nate runs into Cristobel he's horrified to find she's put a hiatus on dating until June finds someone so Nate takes it upon himself to find anyone willing to date the \"Nottie\" so he can claim the \"Hottie\"\n\nReleased in 2008, the film was Paris Hilton's one attempt to headline a theatrical film following a largely forgotten and ignored National Lampoon Direct-to-Video film, Pledge This! And a supporting role in the House of Wax remake. Upon initial release the film was savaged by critics, many of whom placed it on their worst of the year lists and made a paltry $27,000 dollars in the United States against a $9 million budget. Internationally it fared little better, barely breaking $1 million. While the film is certainly a vanity project with its premise built around Hilton's \"Hotness\", it's not even a good vanity project as its completely lacking in good writing, good direction, or even a good supporting cast.\n\nThe movie's lead of Joel David Moore's Nate is easily one of the worst leading comic performances I've seen in a romantic comedy. Not only is Joel David Moore playing the pathetic loser trope up to the nth degree, but scenes of him lusting over Cristobel come off as massively creepy including a scene during the \"meet-cute\" where Nate follows behind Cristobel on her jog without her knowing and sniffing her hair. Moore has shown himself to be a more than capable comic presence in films like Dodgeball or Grandma's Boy, but in both of those he was a supporting player for a good reason. He doesn't have appeal as a leading man. Paris Hilton basically coasts off her looks not so much \"acting\" as standing in reading lines in a voice that doesn't even change octaves. Easily the worst performance in the film goes to the credited \"The Greg Wilson\" playing a creepy overgrown man-child who treats his mother like a secretary and keeps an extensive filing system on Cristobel in another misfire of a joke that feels like it was put there to make Nate look less creepy by comparison (NO! I hate them both!).\n\nSpeaking of the jokes, there's basically two types: Men stumbling and drooling over themselves as they leer at Cristobel or hackneyed gross out jokes around the character June and overdone reactions thereof. Poor Christine Lakin is clearly trying and gives the \"best\"(albeit still not great, but no one in this movie makes it out in tact) performance but virtue of at least being able to express a diverse range but is buried under overdone make-up effects and obvious facial and mouth prosthetics for the sake of stupid jokes. The movie tries to excuse its stupidity by going for a \"beauty on the inside\" type approach, but it lingers on characters being grossed out borderline gynecological shots of Paris Hilton that are so transparent that it's clear this message is about as hollow as the film's box office receipts. The movie is basically a lesser version of the Farrelly Brothers Shallow Hal which was already a pretty flawed movie in its delivery of the same premise, but it had sincerity to it that made it more forgivable. There's nothing \"sincere\" about The Hottie and the Nottie, it's a cynical attempt to ape the Farrelly Brothers style of raucous gross out humor without actually understanding why it works and instead just hoping that Paris Hilton's name will be enough sell tickets."

Even the title makes me cringe, so let that set a tone for what is to come.\n\nFirst off, despite many warnings from other IMDb members, I decided to give this film a shot, letting my own jokes give me a cheap thrill. I'll say this, it makes Twilight look like Star Trek. I wasn't expecting Oscar material, but boy did I get it. Even Oscar the Grouch would be ashamed to have this filth in his trash can.\n\nEnough blind insults for now, let me give you the plot (Not that you'll watch this film anyway). Basically one girl has another friend that drives boys away, and she tries to give her a boyfriend. Wow, Shakespeare himself would deem this to be a true literary achievement, he lied. It's bland, generic, uncreative, and a horrible excuse to get Paris Hilton more exposure.\n\nI am honestly astonished on how they managed to make a movie, if you would call this one, this amazingly bad. I have to ask, why isn't this lower on the bottom 100? I ask you, why? The money used to make this waste of film could have been used to feed starving Ethiopian children! A showing of this piece of festering trash would be illegal since it'd classify as torture!\n\nI implore you, unless you'd like to kill off every brain cell in your noggin, have a severe masochist fetish, or you have a thing for astronomically crappy films, do not, I repeat, DO NOT watch this movie. It's a disgrace to American cinema, and a shining example of why foreign countries want to blow us off the map."

The acting unsurprisingly by Paris Hilton (not even half as good looking as her character is meant to be in movie) was terrible but I have to say I was relatively impressed with Christine Lakin's (The Nottie) performance who was miles above the rest of the crew and I was disappointed to see her resolving to a movie like this. I think that Paris Hilton should \"Throw in the towel\" and discontinue her acting career as the 2 movies in which she has been the main character (Pledge This! and The hottie and the nottie) are both in the IMDb bottom 100 movies of all time (Ratings of 1.7 and 1.6). That should kind of send her the message that if she wants to continue being an actor she'd be better suited to being an extra on a midday soap opera.\n\nOverall the movie was slightly \"watchable\" but I think the only reason I was remotely entertained is because I thought it was going to be the worst movie of all time but there is worse such as \"The Love Guru\", \"Martians go Home\", \"The Pink Panther 2\" and the appalling \"Get Smart\"\n\nBy Michael"

It's such a mess that not even \"Step By Step\"'s Christine Lakin can save it, and that ought to say a lot. The jokes? Well, pretty much all of them come from a wacky sidekick, and unfortunately this actor isn't half as funny as he seems to think he is. Paris Hilton also farts. Twice. That's about it I guess. The story is supposedly touching, but the moral lessons seem highly questionable. What we learn from the movie is basically: always go for the girl with inner beauty, but wait until she gets a make-over and starts looking like Christine Lakin. Before that happens, just completely ignore her. Thanks for clearing that out, \"Hottie And The Nottie\". What a wreck of a movie, downright painful to see."

Following another failed relationship, he decides to track her down, engaging his friend Arno (Greg Wilson) to help. Arno explains that whilst Cristabel has grown up to be a beautiful woman, men are kept away from her by her best friend June (Christine Lakin) who is physically unappealing to the opposite sex. Nate orchestrates a meeting with Cristabel, which goes well but in order to get his date, he'll hate to find someone willing to join them as a suitor for June.\n\nIt's important that I get across pretty quickly that this film is awful.

Ugly people deserve scorn and only become acceptable as worthy of love when they undergo massive cosmetic surgery to change themselves seems to be the moral point that the film seems happy to run with. Jealousy and entitlement are seemingly admirable qualities and in the words of Family Guy \"It's alright to lie to women, they're not real people like you and me\".\n\nThe performances are awful, as you might imagine when you look down a cast list of people whose careers never took off. Hilton is not asked to do much and whilst she's not staggeringly awful with it, she brings little to the role. The premise of the film struggles when it comes to June's personality. There's no real explanation why she's keeping men away from Cristobel - we see her eviscerate one man who dares to try, but otherwise she doesn't seem to hate men in general and seems to want to be in a relationship herself.\n\nIts only slight redeeming quality was that I felt there was some awareness of the horribleness from Joel David Moore's leading man and, occasionally, he managed to raise the smallest of laughs with his delivery.\n\nIt's scant reward for sitting through what I'll again point out is an awful film, but again - if this is the worst film you've ever seen, consider yourself lucky."

The people only hates this movie because of Paris Hilton's egocentric behavior, which is true, but not for the movie itself. The Love Guru is worst than this movie, when I saw it I thought I was going to vomit. This movie is only doesn't make me want to vomit, it is only a waste of time.\n\nMaybe if Paris Hilton wouldn't be that selfish, this movie could be better. The others actors aren't that bad, only her, specially on the parts when she sees at the camera and pretends to be hot, and she is not. Other fact that made the movie's quality worst was the script, it was made only to made Paris Hilton look smarter than she really is. She gives stupid metaphors all around the movie!!!!! Moore's performance wasn't really very bad, but it is difficult to look good in a bad movie.\n\nMy rating is 3/10,as i said, bad but not the worst"

I think something we can learn from this movie is that you should make the most of who you are, don't put yourself down. If you don't believe in yourself, who will? I know a lot of people hated this movie because of Paris Hilton. If you focus on the story, its far better than most movies today. I'd definitely recommend it, especially to teenage girls.

That's pretty much the only positive things I can say.\n\nThere's so many problems here. I guess the first thing to say is that the story to start with doesn't seem to have had the potential to have gone anywhere. The story is painfully predictable and I don't get the whole premise of having a young man continuing to lust over his childhood love interest from 20 years ago (whom Hilton plays.)\n\nThe gags pretty much all fall flat, there is zero evidence of any thought being put in here. The jokes all revolve around the disgusting nature of June. If you thought the likes of American Pie had too much gross-out humour, you've seen nothing yet.\n\nIt pains me to say but it's deserving of it's title as one of the worst films of all time."

Make your own decisions and make your own opinions. I actually enjoyed everyones role in this movie. After seeing some of Paris' past work i wasn't sure how she was going to do, but she really pulled it off. Showing she can learn and be adaptive and it has paid off making her a good actress in her own right. Anyone who judges this movie based solely on the fact that Paris is in it is ridiculously biased. And completely unfair. Not only are you judging someone you don't know, but you are also judging everyone in the movie for just acting alongside her. This isn't third grade. Please grow up."

But he also cannot forget his first crush, the tall, attractive, blonde Cristabel Abbott, from their time in elementary school. Nate sets out for the beaches of California and meets up with his geeky best friend Arno, whose mother has an unnatural amount of information about Cristabel, and perhaps an unusual relationship with her son.\n\nCristabel jogs on the beach every day with many suitors trying to catch her eye, including an albino stalker. But she's still single, and there is a reason: Cristabel is still best friends with the same short, unattractive brunette girl whom Nate also knew in elementary school, June Phigg.\n\nNate reintroduces himself to Cristabel and they hit it off. However, Cristabel refuses to go on a date with Nate unless June has a date as well. Nate sets out to find a boyfriend for June, but guys recoil at the sight of her. One day at the Santa Monica Pier, Johann Wulrich, an attractive dentist who works as a part-time model, appears in their lives. He seems to want to do a makeover on June when he apparently sees her inner beauty. However, Nate believes that Johann is a threat to his shot for Cristabel, since Johann is almost perfect. Eventually, with June dating Johann, Cristabel finally begins dating Nate, per his original plan.\n\nOver the next few weeks, as Nate and June become friends and she emerges from her cocoon, with her face and appearance transforming into that of an attractive woman whose beauty begins to compare with Cristabel, Nate slowly realizes that June may be the girl of his dreams. Nate tells this to Cristabel, who is happy for June. Nate then tries to find June, and finds her, telling her how he feels.\n\nBuy The DVD And Don't Be Brainwashed By Haters!.

I wonder if Paris Hilton can stay in any long-term relationship in real-life?\n\n-> Paris' philosophy about the human soul vs body and how we look on the outside.\n\n-> The revealing \"flashback\" story-telling technique that is used to explain present relationships in relation to the past.\n\nIf you want a good laugh and a little learning philosophy in how humans judge others, watch this movie.

WOW what a movie!\n\nParis Hilton again amazes the audience with a truly masterful performance. she shows us why she has the determination and the talent to become one of Hollywood's finest actresses.\n\nnext, i'd like to congratulate tom Putnam for showing us that he has the leadership and skill to rise among the ranks of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg.\n\ni can't remember the last time i laughed throughout the entirety of a film. this movie gets two big thumbs up for originality, and the best acting in 2008 so far. move aside Indiana Jones, make way for one of the all time greats in the movie industry.\n\ncheers Paris"

That being said I love movies with slightly cringe acting/moments as I feel it makes the movie better. Plus it has Paris Hilton herself! Who wouldn't love seeing a movie with Paris Hilton? I was mentally, emotionally and physically invested and interested in this movie! Nice amount of raunchiness for a teen movie, great chemistry, hilarious jokes/gross out scenes, Paris Hilton looks hot in the movie, the movie uses a romance movie cliche that I absolutely love, it's a teen movie. What else could you want? I highly recommend it!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie was written in an era that you were telling the things as they were without thinking of hurting the feelings of the other. So please give some slack to this movie. In addition, many comment on the poor performance of Paris Hilton. However, do bare in mind that it was her first steps into the movie industry and never she considered herself an actor. She was more of a guest star that the producers wanted to have her more as a \"supermodel-diva\" personality which in my opinion she delivered perfectly. As of the movie itself, it is a typical goofy comedy with a happy ending. No idea why so many hate towards it, but if you are not easily offended and you want to pass your night with laughters, do see it!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Some people have slated this movie saying its not very good, but to be honest once you've watched it 7 times its actually very funny. It's one of Paris's best films since One Night in Paris. The supporting cast all gave a fantastic performance, especially Jeremy Scott Johnson who plays \"Little Girls Dad\". I thought he was great when i saw in an episode of Criminal Minds, but this film really shows off his potential as a great actor. I look forward to seeing his career take off. So overall if your looking for a funny film and good acting i would recommend The Hottie & the Nottie. Fingers crossed The Hottie & the Nottie 2 is in the pipeline."

Just because someone isn't a similar acting to Jack Nickolson doesn't mean they aren't talent or enjoyable to watch.\n\nMy teenage daughters also enjoyed the movie. They actually watched it twice in one weekend. They invited their friends over on Saturday after watching it once on Friday."
