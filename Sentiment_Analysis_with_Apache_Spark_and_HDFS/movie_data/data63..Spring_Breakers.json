        "review_detailed_main": "Harmony Korine is a strange one. I've seen 3 of his other films, Gummo, Mister Lonely and Julien Donkey Boy and I thought they were decent to good. I can often see what he's trying to do but its lack of character and substance hurts it. Spring Breakers is perhaps his most mainstream effort given the concept, stars and the slick production but it's probably his least interesting. With MTV style cinematography and editing, a dubstep soundtrack and drama distant from the camera, the result is an unpleasant nightmare. I'm not sure who this film is aiming at, the type of person the film is about or the art-house crowd where the the techs are the furthest to their taste? It wants to be a comment on contemporary party culture but its unrealistic characters make it unbearably tedious. Every time a character starts to becomes sympathetic, they leave the film, and far too easily at that. Why are we even trapped in this nightmare if the characters are deliberately raising the stakes? It's a film that relishes on forced juxtapositions such as singing Britney Spears over robberies and it ends up obvious or pointless, nulling its effect. I still don't really know what to make to Spring Breakers but it definitely isn't my thing.\n\n5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a strange film. On the one hand, it looks likes an extended music video, filled with mindless scenes of teenagers having one big party. On the other hand, there's clearly more to it. Some characters are so one-dimensional and cartoon-like, that the whole film becomes a sort of mockery of the modern teenage culture. This ambiguity is very clever, because the film appeals to a teenage audience as well as to the art-house audience Harmony Korine is usually associated with.\n\nBut at the same time, this ambiguity stands in the way of 'Spring Breakers' being a really good film. Unlike other serious movies about teenage culture, like 'Thirteen', 'Ghost World', Korine's own 'Kids' or the recent 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower', this film looks too easy. The temptation of showing lots of girls in bikini has been stronger than the ambition of trying to tell something meaningful.\n\nStill, there are some nice moments. The hold-up in the restaurant is beautifully filmed from the window of a car slowly passing by. It's nice that, later on in the film, the director shows some short moments of what happened inside the restaurant. I would have liked more ambitious film making like that, and less footage of wild parties."

The reason for its controversy stems from the fact that its target audience found its plot to be pointless, even though that was the point. This film depicts the shallowness of the modern definition of what is 'cool', like idolizing people that suck, those that contribute nothing to society but cheap entertainment. This sort of fascination blindly controls youth, the main reason so many did not understand the meaning behind this movie: they are blind to its influences. They think week long drinking binges, whoring themselves out, and having no goals is cool, because YOLO. However, this film is based off of these components and its audience deems the plot as pointless. Funny. Spring Breakers is like this generation looking itself directly in the mirror.\n\nOverall, Spring Breakers is full of outstanding graphics, bright colors, provocative scenes, and young Disney turned Hollywood stars. It was fun yet hard to watch, depending how serious of a reality check you need (assuming you even understood that it was one)"

To think this film currently has a 6.3 rating and generally favourable reviews elsewhere is really strange. There is booze, sex and drugs but you need something of substance to make even a half decent film, this doesn't even come close.\n\nActing is poor, girls are largely annoying and there is nothing happening whatsoever, it makes no sense, it just dwells on the over importance of spring break, there is no character development and it's a total waste of time, I was bored. It plods along pointlessly for an hour gets decent for 10 minutes and finishes off with a meaningless ending.\n\nI haven't seen After Earth and yes it may be disappointing but it will never be this bad, it's a shame a film like that would get such bad reviews, I mean at least they have tried something, Spring Breakers doesn't even do that, the plot has more holes than a string vest.\n\nIf I was to think about a top 10 worst films list this would most likely be on it, it is definitely one of the worst I have seen in years I would have gave it a 1 but it does have a catchy soundtrack for the younger crowd, some scenes are well shot and James Franco does pretty well for his part which does however start becoming repetitive like everything else due to the poor script. Very overrated not everyone will agree but I'm sure some will, especially if they have seen or watch after this review."

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't even know where to begin...\n\nHarmony Korine is a true artist. That might be where to start, because everyone seems to diss this film and its director, and I'm here to disagree. He kept his style, and that's why I loved it! Most people who went to see this probably didn't know anything about him and also probably didn't care about who he was or what he had done before... The guy wrote the 1995 drama \"Kids\" directed by Larry Clark, which was the most controversial film of that year, dealing with hard and difficult themes to portrait on film (such as teenage, sex, drugs, street life etc...) and treating of problems people didn't want to face. But Larry Clark's documentary and realistic style made the movie look like an open critic of this generation to the world, and was therefore more accepted by critics. In 1997 Korine then directed the very strange independent film \"Gummo\", which didn't really have any scenario, just a presentation of a little town in Ohio and its very bizarre set of characters... But the movie was still pretty good because of its weird and sentimental atmosphere mixed with documentary-style filming. He also made other independent films, but all of them always stayed in the \"weird\" and \"unknown\" section of DVD libraries.\n\nHere Korine has grown up and gained more experience with the years. This is by far his most accomplished work, but unfortunately by distributing this movie to a bigger audience, he encountered a lot of criticism and hate, just because more people saw and discovered his style. I am afraid that most people today just watch films to have something to watch. Movies nowadays are being more consumed and less actually watched and thought-over. The poster and the trailer for this film were a parody of these easy-selling films that the Hollywood industry makes every year, who don't have anything particularly original (and that's on ALL levels : directing, script, acting, score are all very similar to any other film made by the studio), but instead of seeing the parody of these posters with those good-looking girls, people took it seriously and thought this was just going to be another teen movie about spring break with some fancy action scenes and a seen-before plot. But no, this was something NOBODY could've see coming... or at last not general, ordinary, image-dose seeking spectator.\n\nNow lets actually talk about the film, I kind of got lost here! First things first : the cinematography and the look of this film are amazing. Even if you didn't like it, you can't say that this wasn't beautifully shot and crafted. The camera work is probably the best I've seen in a long time, and the neon colors add a really good look, which contributes to the atmosphere the film is trying to have. Then, the acting is great. James Franco totally takes his character to another level, even thought Korine has done an amazing job with this one, as he often never disappoints when it comes to characters. The girls are good too, and I was really surprised by Selena Gomez. Now comes the score and music : noting to say, absolutely brilliant! All songs fit perfectly to the scenery of spring break, blending Skrillex with hardcore hip-hop but also getting on the sensitive and emotional side sometimes with a Britney Spears cover (seems like she actually made some good songs) an awesome atmospheric score by Cliff Martinez, as always (he did the score for Drive and Only God Forgives) and of course putting Ellie Goulding's Lights in there, just brilliant!\n\nNow, some parts of this films aren't perfect, this isn't the best movie ever made or anything, but it is true work of art and not just a mix of drugs, sex, profanity and violence made by a crazy director in order to sell it. No, this is a very well-thought film, made by a director who actually has the balls to keep his own style no matter the audience is, and who uses sarcasm and reversed psychology in its storytelling in order to transmit its message, which (lets be honest) isn't the most common way to do things in modern American cinematographic industry...\n\nTo sum it up, this was an extremely underrated movie, mostly watched by a lot of dumb teens and young adults who thought it was just going to be another Hollywood style flick starring old Disney actresses who want to break their image, but instead of that they got a weird art-house film that didn't follow the \"rules\" of the filmmaking industry and therefore disappointed them because it wasn't particularly funny in the way that most films are, and it showed sex, drugs and violence in a real, strange, and (too) explicit way for them to enjoy. Hopefully there are still some real cinema lovers out there who recognize the true value of this film. To them I say keep good and interesting movies alive but watching them, and to Harmony Korine, I just want to say thank you and bravo, for having the guts to put out on screen such a wonderful nightmare!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Faith, played by Selema Gomez, and her three very close friends plan to escape their boring college dorm lives to attend a massive Spring Break party. In order to pay for their getaway, her three friends commit an unthinkable act of terror. Their Spring Break vacation turns out to be a non-stop party of drunken drug use and sexual perversion that lands them in prison. This is when Alien, played by James Franco, bails them out and a new type of party begins.\n\nWith a dub-step softcore porn music video opening sequence, it is uncertain if Spring Breakers is glorifying the demoralizing activities portrayed or if it is a satire. Even when the film is not flashing to what looks like stock footage of a Girls Gone Wild Spring Break special and we are with the girls, the framing seems to have been done by a sex addict. This will be one of the most uncomfortable experiences Selema Gomez's fans will ever experience. For parents, this will be an absolute nightmare. Younger male audiences, on the other hand, will think they've found their new favorite movie. When the girls are introduced to Alien the film feels like it gets a new director. The feeling of a Girls Gone Wild narrative feature film is lost and we are filled with a great sense of dread. Who is this guy who calls himself Alien? We even find ourselves afraid to find out what he has planned for these young girls he has bailed out of prison.\n\nAs we continue through the second half of the film, it becomes very clear that we are in fact watching a satire. A horrific and effective satire. This is done though exposing the character of Alien and much credit must be given to James Franco, this is him at his best. Through the course of the film we go from fearing him, to laughing at him, to feeling sorry for him. The film is worth watching just for Franco's performance. The girls do an excellent job as well. These are easily two of the most frightening female characters ever put on-screen.\n\nSpring Breakers is written and directed by Harmony Korine, the writer of Kids and director of Gummo. If you've seen anything he has written or directed you already know what you are in for. It has the core of a Natural Born Killers story wrapped in layers of what would be if Terrence Malick directed Girls Gone Wild.\n\nWhat ends up becoming an annoying distraction is the repetition of dialogue we hear over and over again, playing in a loop. It's understood we are in the girl's shoes, things are spiraling out of control and the editing helps get that across. Some of it works but in the end, we've heard the same things so many times it is as if Korine is hammering the message of his satire into our heads, almost desperate to prove it has a point. Through the story it's meaning is made clear, no reason to over-use certain Malick-like editing techniques to over-state what the story has already made obvious.\n\nThe core story is genius. The way in which the story is told is split between things that play out like a master at work and a new filmmaker still experimenting."

It is astonishing to me that this generation finds a movie this horribly scripted, filmed, and thought-out to be good. It is not controversial, racy, or thought- provoking. It gives no insight, message, or underlying theme. It isn't that I do not like controversial, bad-ass, or vulgar films.. I do. This film offered none of that! I love films that give insight into a generation or group of people that others do not generally interact with; but this movie did not even accurately portray these things.

Franco's character was very out there but it worked in the context of the film.\n\nA wildly underrated film which was probably hampered by the fact that people were expecting a frat bro comedy, when in actuality this is a much more elevated and stylish affair."

        "review_detailed_main": "Can someone explain to me why SPRING BREAKERS was in the comedy section of my local department store? I can only imagine how many people saw this movie sitting on the shelf with it's cover portraying Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson, Rachel Korine, and James Franco in beach-mode and thought, \"Well this movie looks like a fun time! It's like THE HANGOVER for the Disney crowd!\" I am, of course, assuming that the majority of people buying movies from my local department stores are fools who aren't familiar with movie ratings or aware of movie reviews. And I'm pretty sure I'm right. Anyway, SPRING BREAKERS is not a comedy and, if it is, I missed something somewhere. This movie is a 90 minute hallucination and a rough one. It centers on four longtime friends: Candy (Hudgens), Brit (Benson), Cotty (Korine), and Faith (Gomez). Spring Break has arrived and their too poor to leave campus when everyone heads down south to the beaches of Florida for a week of insane debauchery. We receive our first hint that these girls aren't quite right when Candy, Brit, and Cotty decide to rob an all-night chicken shack for their Spring Break funds. From there, it's beaches, booze, and bongs as the girls party it up until their arrested in a narcotics bust when they're in the wrong place at the wrong time. Enter Alien\u0085a wannabe gangster who makes his living dealing drugs and robbing spring-breakers. He bails out the girls and enlists them to join him in business, and it all goes nuts from there.\n\nSPRING BREAKERS isn't so much a film as it is an experience. It's a visual journey, popping with neon color and thumping with an electronic soundtrack, that won't settle with most average viewers. I had a friend that wanted to see this movie purely for the bikini-clad stars but I warned him against it because I didn't want to hear the eventual complaints that he had no idea what was going on. While I'm totally cool with helping others experience new movies and different styles of filmmaking, I know there's a line and, in this instance, that line is filmmaker Harmony Korine. There is a story present in SPRING BREAKERS but it's done in such a unique and mind-bending fashion that I guarantee it'll turn a lot of people off. Personally, I enjoyed it. After I first watched it, it didn't take some processing on my part and multiple viewings have only made me appreciate it more. I'm a newbie when it comes to Harmony Korine's previous work. I've never seen KIDS or GUMMO but I've heard enough about them to know I need to check them out at some point. For now, SPRING BREAKERS is my first exposure to his work and it's got my attention. It pits a dark crime story against the vibrant energized atmosphere of the crazy college world of Spring Break. At least, the Spring Break you've seen on MTV\u0085drunk, sexually jack-up college students going totally insane.\n\nThis is a movie about evil people. Seriously, all but one person in this movie is a sociopath. The only objectively good person in the movie bails as soon as things start going sour. The most fun is watching the dark side of these girls slowly reveal themselves as the movie goes on. You start to wonder who's really the one being manipulated: these girls or Alien? You know they're not your average college hotties early on when you see how easily crime comes to them, but you don't realize how cold they can be. Despite the girls' rapid descent into the seedier side of Spring Break, the violence isn't over-the-top here. The nudity is\u0085so, you know, this really isn't for the actual longtime fans of people like Hudgens and Gomez. This is their attempt at breaking free from their Disney Channel roots. Hudgens had some success with her turn in SUCKER PUNCH but this secures it. I'm pretty sure pot-smoking and threesomes are a surefire way to bust out of that mold. Gomez doesn't go as nuts here but she's still doing her best to be seen as an actual actress. The performances are pretty good for what they are. James Franco has been receiving a lot of praise for his role as Alien. Honestly, he annoyed me the first time I watched the movie. Horribly. But it wasn't his performance, it's just that people like the grate on my nerves. Franco does a great job here, and it's one of his most strange performances.\n\nSPRING BREAKERS isn't for everyone and I'd hope most people would know what they're settling in for if they decide to watch it. It's a gritty, surreal film with some nice eye candy and a foreboding atmosphere playing against the Spring Break wonderland we all envision when we think of college co-eds going nuts. It's a refreshing change from the usual mainstream release, even if it can be a little frustrating to watch at times."

After completing this movie I sat in silence for 10 minutes wondering that it was that I just watched. It just kept dragging and dragging for no reason. There is no way to write a summary to this movie because the movie has no substance.

It encapsulates the abrasive yet optimistic tone around the time of its release, full of florescent lights, neon clothes and dubstep music.\n\nWhile it has the hyper-sexualized party scenes that contemporary films like Project X were built around, Spring Breakers arthouse ambition allows it to stand out from similar-seeming films and allowing it to improve with time. As one of the first films released by A24, it is an important step in the direction that the company would follow: prioritizing artistic decision-making, not shying away from explicit content and having a dope ass lighting/color palette."

While watching it, I felt my senses were assaulted, but there was more to it than what I was able to discern viscerally. Therein lies the greatness of this movie. It makes you think about what images are being thrown at you and why. The image is obviously that of what the youth of our age are sold as 'the good life': money, drugs, sex and partying. This is the American Dream. This movie follows 4 girls who do despicable acts, who behave with such depravity and who are shallow to the core, that watching this can be painful at times. But that is the whole point and people who walk out of this feeling as though they have had their time robbed of them or are too disgusted by what they see are missing the point. I am not an elitist movie critic in no sense of the word either, but I know a shock movie when I see one.\n\nI have to say that visually this movie is beautiful (and no, I am not referencing the nudity here, ha-ha). It is a dark, dreamy, neon- nightmare. I give credit to the movie for this because it is candy for the eyes. Production wise this movie is solid, as is the direction. You feel as if you are in a dream, with it's poignant use of slow motion, and I suppose that is the effect they were looking to achieve. In this aspect they succeeded with flying colours - literally. There's also a beautifully crafted scene during their robbery of a restaurant that features one of the girls rolling the car around the building, catching glimpses of what they were doing inside. A very good piece of cinematography.\n\nThe cast were great too. I can't really say too much for the female cast as they did all act well in their respective roles. James Franco on the other hand really stood out and delivered a superb performance in what I would say is one of his more challenging roles, because the character himself is just so unlikable and unlike anyone he has portrayed before. He definitely made this movie, and without him in it it would seem to be missing a magic ingredient. Time and again Franco proves his worth as one of the great actors of his generation. He obviously knew that this movie's worth exceeded the majority of our expectations.\n\nIt seems the point of this film is lost upon most, which is a shame, though I can understand why. On the surface this appears to be a shallow and uninspiring piece of crap theatre with no motive beyond showing us some tits and ass. It is so much more. I love movies that make me think, even if they are at the time disturbing to watch. Well, this is what we are supposed to enjoy watching, after all. This is what our media, our 'culture', our idols depict as the epitome of what constitutes the good life. We are told to live our youth to the full. Is this not what they do throughout the movie? Are you not entertained? No?\n\nIsn't that just it though? The truth hurts. This is the truth of what our youth aspire to. Sad, ain't it. Maybe I should give this a 1 star rating. I'm sure that's what the director would want me to do."

        "review_detailed_main": "I can't describe the elation I felt leaving Spring Breakers--truly one of the best films to hit mainstream cinemas in a long time. It was a breath of fresh air amidst all the cookie cutter romantic comedies, dramas, action films, and horror movies that plague modern cinema. The stamp of a good film is the impact factor--how long it stays with you when it's over. Spring Breakers was a film that stayed with me long after leaving the theater. It didn't evaporate from my mind as soon as I hit the parking lot. This film affects you and leaves you in a mood long after the credits appear.\n\nThose seeking a fun \"party film\" will be disappointed. The TV ads, poster, and cast have probably misled some viewers into thinking this is a cross between The Hangover and Project X. Don't let the cast or the marketing fool you--this is not a \"feel good\" movie. It's a dark, exciting, tragic look at modern youth culture that doesn't so much as revel in the pop culture sensory overload as hold up a mirror to the audience so we can see some of ourselves in these kids. And if you're like me, you'll find this kind of self-reflection very disturbing. More than once, I was disgusted and enthralled with these characters, not knowing whether I should feel amused, angry, or sad. This is truly the best deconstruction of modern culture I've seen.\n\nThe movie starts with our main quartet of female characters struggling to find a way around the fact they don't have enough money to travel to Florida for that much-hyped, almost mythical annual rite of passage nearly every college kid in the country has to face at some point: spring break. Selena Gomez is easily the most likable member of the cast--a young girl struggling to balance her Christian faith and values in the moral wasteland that is college life. One moment we see her praying in church, and the next she's passively condoning the fact that her friends have just robbed a restaurant in order to obtain the rest of the money they need to make it to Florida. In one poignant monologue, she speaks of the monotony of life and how everyone is depressed because they wake up and see the same things every day. Her desire to go on spring break is almost spiritual in nature--a soul-searching journey in which she just wants to be someone new and be free.\n\nThe spring break party scenes are manic--loud music, hypnotic imagery, and disorienting colors all come together like some kind of dream. The fun soon ends once the girls are arrested for using narcotics at a wild party. They have two options: pay a fine, or remain in jail for another two days. Out of money and unwilling to call their parents, the girls languish in jail until a mysterious visitor posts their bail. Enter James Franco as Alien, a white gangster with gold teeth, dreadlocks, and a ton of money and guns to go along with his criminal tendencies. Franco truly breaks out in this performance, becoming someone I never could have imagined he'd be able to pull off back in his Spider-Man days. His intentions are murky and the film never misses an opportunity to make us feel uncomfortable witnessing his interactions with the girls. It's at this point that the film takes a drastic turn into even darker territory, the trip slowly proving itself to be more than a few of them bargained for. Thus begins the tragic slide into the dark nature of these characters, as they find themselves participating in and doing things bound to seduce the audience into an awe-struck state more than once.\n\nNot that any of this is told through a conventional narrative. The whole film feels like one crazy, hypnotic dream, from its use of colors to its loud, insane score that ranges from romping party fun to atmospheric, moody pieces that underline the darker moments in the film. The narrative jumps around in time and space, pasted together through flashbacks, flash forwards, and repetitive lines that linger in the back of the viewer's mind like a broken record. The cinematography is flat out excellent and the filmmakers make perfect use of the beautiful Florida scenery amidst all the sheer depravity we witness on screen, with more than a few shots of the beautiful Florida sky and sunset to remind us of our humanity.\n\nBy the time the film reaches a delirious montage of violence set to the unlikely tune of Britney Spears' song Every time, Korine has us hook, line, and sinker feeling a sense of revulsion and pity for ourselves and the world at large. Any film that can provoke this type of uncomfortable self-contemplation deserves to be praised.\n\nIn the end, I left the theater feeling like I'd just come off an intense acid trip into the darker recesses of modern culture, emotionally exhausted and ready to get in my car and drive home in silence, reflecting on what I'd just seen.\n\nIf you're not expecting to have fun and aren't afraid to look inside yourself to that aspect of your personality that craves materialism and vapid entertainment at the expense of losing some of your humanity, go and see Spring Breakers. It's truly one of the best films of 2013 (so far) and will no doubt be a cult classic in years to come. Just don't blame me if the film haunts you long after it's over."

What's important is that this movie is BORING. Sure, it's well produced, but what does that matter when you have a two hour movie with maybe three scenes worth mentioning? And going back to that controversial stuff, there's been some debate as to whether it's female empowerment or sexist exploitation. I've heard it argued both ways. In fact, I watched this in a film class I'm taking, consensus seemed to be that it was some sort of commentary on how the kind of life you see in music videos makes for a nice fantasy, but isn't all it's cracked up to be. While I can say there's some merit to that theory, as it certainly feels like a two hour long music video (and I say that as a bad thing), frankly, I have a bit of a tendency to take things at face value. I would honestly say the writer/director (whom I can't remember the name of) just decided to make the movie sleazy and exploitative as a substitute for actually having anything interesting going on. And since it made more than 4 times its budget at the box office, apparently it worked! I guess there's a market for two hours of horny women in bikinis doing drugs and committing crimes! As a gay male, it's clearly one I'm not in.\n\nIn conclusion, would not recommend."

Fantastic acting throughout the lead roles, highlighted by Franco's truly amazing performance as Alien, extends the movie further, and the portrayal of the characters is definitely more important than the actions. The movie not about Spring Break. It isn't about robbery. It is about emotion, change, and the beauty that comes from apathetic destruction. It truly is more of a psychotic documentary than the drama that it is made out to be, and the result is beautiful.\n\nHowever, there is a significant divide in the perception of this film. It caters intentionally to those who see film as an art form, but it is also unintentionally perfect for the inevitably simple masses who just want to see hot women and violence. The problem is the middle: people who are somewhat informed, who aren't controlled by their baser instincts, but also aren't as experienced in critiquing or understanding movies or art. Those people will inevitably hate this movie, seeing it as just another wasted, trashy, teenage movie, instead of noticing the painful beauty that echoes throughout.\n\nThis movie is one of the finest films produced in the last decade."

        "review_detailed_main": "Spring breakers is my first taste of Harmony Korine and I can't wait to see more of his work. You won't get the same experience spring breakers provides from any other movie.\n\nI think this film has a lot of say about the superficial nature of the american dream and the United States as a whole. Alien is a representation of the american dream in a, not so subtle way. The american dream is, \"the ideal by which equality of opportunity is available to any American, allowing the highest aspirations and goals to be achieved\", it's all about working hard and most of all, being successful. Alien is successful and he does work hard but he is a criminal. it's like he says, he's a gangster, even though he is an awful person he is still a success in the eyes of the United States of America.\n\nThe first half does not have a plot once the girls go on spring break, it is more about capturing the feeling of spring break, the drugs, the sex, the music, it captures the vibe of the situation perfectly. In New Zealand we don't have spring break, our equivalent is our end of year holiday, even though I don't have spring break it's the same thing so I can still judge whether the energy of the situation is captured well.\n\nDuring the second half of the movie, as the girls slowly leave spring break you slowly come to realise that such a superficial life can't last forever, spring break is not forever. No matter how bad you want to live that life in the end you will end up like Alien or Archie, two people who did live spring break forever could not sustain that lifestyle. They were living the most frivolous life possible, in other words, they were living the american dream. This is why Brit and Candy loved him, he was living the life that they want to live, they didn't see anything wrong with what he was doing because it was fun, they were always having a good time.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the characters are very weak, they get a small bit of character development but not enough for me to actually care about them at all. I think Alien was the best character, he was at least the most interesting.\n\nTechnically there are a few problems like the editing, it was fantastic at times but there were some pretty major pacing issues going from high octane montages to slower paced dialogue scenes and back again. My two favourite technical elements were the lighting and the sound design. The lighting was really clever and different, again the dialogue scenes were not lit as well as some of the others but it was far from bad. The sound design was also brilliant, I loved the use of different noises when characters made certain actions. Without spoiling anything my favourite example of this was when Alien was talking about murdering, he abruptly moved his arms, as he moved his arms a gunshot sound played. This is also not the only example, it happens constantly and I think it's really neat and interesting.\n\nI'll keep this point short but the ending, visual, was really stupid. How did these girls learn to shoot so well and clear out so many people. it was dumb.\n\nSpring breakers is far from a perfect movie but I really enjoyed it. I'm happy Harmony Korine is making movies because I don't think there will be another filmmaker like him for a while. You should definitely watch this if you haven't. I'd say it's a must see, it's so out there."

At first, it's like a high-quality version of the Girls Gone Wild videos. Stunningly-beautiful examples of young American womanhood getting it on, and it's superbly filmed. That's the best idea for a movie since . . . since . . . Girls Gone Wild! How could anything go wrong? Primarily, there's the script. It may have been written on the back on an envelope or a cocktail napkin. Or they may have taken it from one of those dreadful 99\u00a2 amateur Kindle novels. A movie consisting solely of scenes showing Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens . . . uhm . . . \"showing affection\" would've made me happy, but after the scenes of drug and alcohol use, the girls meet up with a local gangsta who wears gold prosthetics on his teeth. James Franco is deliberately made-up to irritate one's retinas.\n\nAt this point, if only they had concentrated on the girls, the movie could morph into a Floridian version of the X-rated 1999 French film *Baise Moi* (banned in Awstralier), but the pace is more like *My Dinner With Andr\u00e9* -- without the dialog.\n\nIt's suddenly a chix-with-guns movie, and I'm down with that, but for a violent shoot-'em-up flic, it moves painfully slow. A slow action-movie? That's like 3-D in black-and-white or a horror movie with cute, cuddly bats. How can it be that scenes of the girls fondling firearms make you wonder when the movie will end? The crippled dialogue becomes more-and-more annoying, and the apologetic ending induces dismay.\n\nIt would be silly to complain that such a movie is unrealistic and not even plausible, but the scenes of the holdup and then the girls wearing bikinis to court are absurd. Each quarter-hour becomes progressively worse, and I began to suspect that the the movie was covertly funded by the clergy in an effort to turn youth away from sin.\n\nLeaving the theater, a kid in the group of youngsters ahead of me exclaimed, \"That's the worst movie I've ever seen!\" Spring Breakers may thus induce young men to join the priesthood. *See?* it says, *Give into temptation, and this is what will happen.* The wages of sin are tedious to watch.\n\nAnyone can make a bad movie, but it takes a perverse genius to ruin fine T&A."

James Franco has forever been banned from my film collection for even agreeing to do this movie let alone the horrible acting he did in it. I've never given a film 1 star before... But believe me, spring breakers earned it. I highly recommend seeing this when they throw it on Netflix in the coming months just to see what this generation deems a \"6 out of 10\" or above.

        "review_detailed_main": "As always, Harmony Korine (Kids, Gummo) has a lot going for him. First of all he has an idea and a mission: Spring Breakers attacks on two fronts. One is an in-your-face, narcissism propaganda filled with semi-naked bodies and all kinds of shallow treats, designed to fascinate, allure and confuse. The other is an implicit condemnation of all the aforementioned stuff; Spring Breakers' protagonists are morally doomed antisocial vermins whose purpose never exceeds their roles in the film. And so the question to be asked is where does the one front end and the second begin? And additionally, what do we as viewers get out of it all? Satire for the sake of satire arguably is as uninteresting as violence for the sake of violence, and at times Spring Breakers treads both these paths. The film alternates between being clever and stupid, relevant and irrelevant, fascinating and downright loathsome, and the result is an uneven slight misfire in which the weaker points, such as the repetitive dialogue and insistent cutting, ultimately become noise instead of aphorisms and artistic effect, respectively. Korine may have a point, perhaps a brilliant one, in arguing that today's shallow, pop-culture-infested youth-generation have lost touch with life's real meaning (whatever that might be), but if so, his own film is part of that pop-culture and ends up biting its own tail. Kudos to the ever-impressive James Franco for an uncompromising performance."

Some can handle it and some can't. I have to start off by saying that this movie is pretty much exactly what you would expect from a movie called Spring Breakers. Lots of drug use, drinking and nudity. For a movie like this to have the cast it does makes the movie more intriguing to see (for me anyway) and they all do a good job in it that you forget who you are watching. The movie started off pretty exciting, the middle really drug but the ending makes you glad you stuck with it. This is by no means amazing or something to rush out and see, but it is a movie that has enough excitement in it to keep you watching and makes you glad you finished it. Overall, nothing too original but worth watching if you can handle it. I give it a B-."

Korine's writing cleverly tricks the audience into a uniquely weird and wild ride.\n\nThe first half of the movie is (deliberately) very slow, and follows a predictable, trope-like set up of Faith's innocence and confusion in contrast to her hedonism-obsessed \"bad girl\" friends. Korine's obsession with visual style, pacing, and mood eventually lead the girls to their goal of \"Spring Break,\" where the audience is bombarded with almost comically excessive displays of debauchery, followed by a quick turn of events that lead them to meet the \"Alien,\" played by James Franco.\n\nIf there is any reason to watch this film, it is to soak in Franco's performance, and watch him elevate the characters he interacts with. His portrayal of a southern gangster-rapper is both seedy and menacing, but also sympathetic. He hams it up with enough hyperbole to be absolutely delightful.\n\nWhile not entirely deep, this film manages to affect one's senses of existential longing, danger, and romance, in ways never hinted at by it's tag line, poster, or trailer. It is strangely musical in a way. From it's darkness through colorful excess, to it's bitter sweet ending, it's a film that shows that both innocence and evil, happiness and despair, are never that far from each other."

Selena Gomez was also a very believable in her role. Well the other chicks, straight up crazy! I think most people will dislike this movie, it doesn't cater to many people. It is an art-house film for the young generation. And just like in the movie, the young generation most likely doesn't care about art-house films!"

It ostensibly features a quartet of young and nubile spring breakers (who spend the entire movie wearing their bikinis for no other reason than to titillate the viewer) who decide to go on an odyssey of crime, drugs, and violence, just for kicks.\n\nThe problems with such a scenario are manifest, namely the entire lack of any sympathetic or likable characters. The girls and the girls alone are responsible for getting themselves into this mess and you don't really care how or if they manage to extricate themselves from it. The acting is poor, particularly from James Franco's black gangster caricature (not a patch on Gary Oldman's similar character in TRUE ROMANCE) and the film as a whole is preoccupied with sex, nudity, and bad taste situations, instead of delivering anything approaching a real plot. It's a dog of a film, there are no two ways about it."

The girls' faces are rarely shown in normal light, making it difficult to identify their faces. There is little actual acting by the girls, except for Selena Gomez, and her real acting doesn't quite add up to five minutes of the film.\n\nThere is little character motivation or character building. We know that the girls are bored with their lives at the beginning of the film. But we don't know why one of the girls keeps shooting her fingers like an imaginary gun.\n\nJames Franco's performance is laughable. He probably does an okay job with the dialog and the scenes he is given. I'd hung in with the movie, waiting for him to appear but the grid on his teeth showed me immediately that his role was going to be over the top and silly. He's an exaggeration of Al Pacino's \"Scarface\" with a goofy ghetto dialect.\n\nThis movie has characters behaving in grotesque, obscene ways. Believe it or not, the various shots--and there is a lot of them--of girls at Spring Break dancing with their arms up in the air, many of them topless and many of them drinking out of a long tube, are the least troubling shots.\n\nThis movie is nasty, grotesque, and over-simplified, with characters that are nothing but clich\u00e9s. I don't know what audience should watch this movie, or for whom this movie was meant. HIgh school and college boys may be entertained by this hour-and-a-half long tacky video."

Real talent is now last on the list, and in any given movie or in real life the aim is to show some skin, whether needed or not.\n\nExample, look at twitter or facebook and the idiots who post naked photo's of themselves, whether famous stars or not, yes - it's wrong, because there is a time and place for everything but Korine just created what's happening now to the extreme and I thought it worked perfectly.\n\nThe performances were alright by the four leading ladies, they didn't really have enough to play with in terms of story but the whole movie still worked with the amazing soundtrack.\n\nJames Franco deserves an Oscar for his role (such a versatile and method actor), and I hope the Academy finally gets something right, as I feel the role of Alien (inspired by a rapper named Dangeruss mainly, who should be getting much more media attention) will become iconic and should be rewarded.\n\nIf you don't know Korine's work before going into this movie, then yes, you will be extremely disappointed or in shock, so best to check out his previous work beforehand but for those who do, then enjoy the ride it works.\n\nClearly, this movie has already divided people's attention, regarding some saying a classic vs. the worst movie ever or just plain confused.\n\nHowever, at least Korine has made you slightly think than the normal blockbuster. Try, watching it a second time and breaking it down further, this might help (so many different interpretations you can take away from this movie, if you just open your mind).\n\nAnyway, I truly enjoyed it and will never consider Britney Spears \"Everytime\" the same way again, that alone deserves the Oscar win for Franco.\n\nWell done, all involved and a cult classic for sure."

        "review_title": "A sad, sad portrait of societal degradation",
        "review_detailed_main": "Not since Ron Fricke's Samsara have I experienced such an enormous sensory and auditory overload. Harmony Korine's Spring Breakers annihilates both senses with absolute impunity, truly making this one of the most engrossing and consuming pictures so far this year. It possesses a style and a message that is so bluntly honest and terrifically captured that it deeply pains me that the audience that needs to see this the most likely will not, due to its eclectic nature and limited release.\n\nLet me begin by saying that this is not the film you think it is. The trailers and commercial spots have done a solid job at attempting to communicate this, but I feel some will still be expecting something a bit too familiar. To go into Spring Breakers expecting something along the lines of a raunchy comedy will be nothing but a cruel and colorful letdown. This is a smart, vibrant, hypnotic fever-dream of a film, heavily accentuating a mix between mainstream raucousness and subversive indie-style. It's something unlike anything I've seen in years.\n\nThe plot follows Faith (Selena Gomez), Brit (Ashley Benson), Candy (Vanessa Hudgens) and Cotty (Rachel Korine, writer/director Harmony Korine's wife), lifelong besties who decide to ditch their monotonous lives to hunger for something bigger and badder over spring break. They head to the sun-soaked \"paradise\" that, allegedly, is Florida, where the girls, already low on cash, first commit a robbery on a fast-food restaurant in order to fund their trip. After that, it's all the dancing, partying, drug-using, drinking, screwing, and gyrating they can stomach.\n\nThe girls are then arrested for being a part of a large band of twentysomethings, who entirely demolished a hotel-room. They don't spend too much time in prison since local, second-rate rapper who calls himself \"Alien\" (played by James Franco in an astonishingly direct fashion) decides to bail them out. In return, he takes the four girls (and then three, when one boldly makes the decision to leave when things are beginning to go awry) under his wing, showing him his wealthy lifestyle and exposing them to the violent drug-culture.\n\nThis story doesn't move nearly as fast as you'd like to think, either. It's punctuated frequently by loud, bombastic musical numbers (often scored by popular techno-artist Skrillex), repetitive montages that heavily emphasize nudity and senseless debauchery, long shots of dreamlike sequences, among other things. It is one of the most accurate replications of this MTV-driven culture I've seen in years. I will go ahead and say there's not another movie you should see this year as much as this one.\n\nWriter/director Harmony Korine has erected his career off of making shocking, often nihilistic pictures with some sort of emphasis on the degradation of teen culture. His debut film Gummo remains as shocking and as raw as it did when it was made in 1997. However, his best work is still Kids (which he wrote, and his close friend Larry Clark brilliantly directed), which centered on an HIV-positive teenager who made a habit out of deflowering young girls in New York City. The film was hard to watch, heart-wrenching to fathom, and so jaw-droppingly pure and authentic in its dialog that it would be difficult for me to experience again.\n\nKorine's statement in Spring Breakers is one that is difficult to directly pinpoint, but I think I may have something. What I can extract is that Korine is trying to show how inconsequential the actions of adolescences have become within the last few years. It seems with every decision, we move further and further from thinking of others and how they may be affected by our choices and attempt to achieve self-gratification and satisfy our impulsiveness. This is a lethal, depressing, but an apparently upcoming standard in teen behavior. Take for example the robbery that happens early in the film. The girls do not seem to carefully plan the event, hence the very impromptu execution we see, and frighteningly, show no remorse when the incident is over. Only one girl, who ups the courage to leave the group, becomes tired of it all and heads home. The other three girls seem to be unleashing something more than just a \"YOLO\" attitude when hanging out with Alien; something far deeper and more psychologically troubling.\n\nMoreover, the neon-cinematography featured here can just be described as hypnotic and nothing else. It's plagued with every color of the rainbow, often resulting in a dizzying, unrelenting trance that gives this film the vibe and uncompromising energy it needs. I can only seem to equate the effect the cinematography has on the viewer to watching the color bars on a TV (usually when a network signs off) and having someone shake the TV in every possible direction. This leads to the overwhelming sensory annihilation I spoke of earlier.\n\nSpring Breakers does everything boldly, beautifully, and shockingly unsettling, as it even goes as far as to brilliantly subject former Disney-branded starlets Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens to the drug-fueled, sex-crazed drudgery of this film. If this doesn't sound like your kind of film, 21 and Over should still be playing in the same multiplex, not too far down from the theater Spring Breakers is in. Perhaps that is more your speed, and that's perfectly fine. Just be aware that that a growing culture and, quite possibly, the one you enjoy, is being satirizes and accurately depicted in a theater near you. Happy viewing.\n\nNOTE: My video review of Spring Breakers, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7qUTpYRQ6o\n\nStarring: James Franco, Selena Gomez, Rachel Korine, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson, and Gucci Mane. Directed by: Harmony Korine."

I think they were trying to make a gritty spring break movie to get away from the same old same old but all they were able to accomplish was a terribly awkward compilation of boobs and bongs. There were so many things wrong with this movie I'm not quite sure where to begin. First of all I'm not sure what the director was thinking there was absolutely no character development through out this movie honestly I didn't know 3 of the 4 main characters names until I looked it up on this website after the movie. Another problem with this movie was that it felt like it was at least an hour longer than it was. I attribute that again to the directing. I think he was trying to be artistic but it ended up feeling like I was watching the movie on repeat. The movie set up is such that you continually hear the same monologues played over the exact same party scenes at least 3 times each in what seems like an endless cycle of deja vue. I could go on and on about the problems in this movie but I'm going to quit here, there are plenty of other reviews that go into more of the almost comical problems that exist in this movie.\n\nOh yeah WTF was going on when they were synchronize dancing with guns, sweat pants, one piece bathing suits and ski masks on??

If you get the chance to see this film, definitely do. But just remember to keep an open mind when viewing and don't let the trashy surface image fool you of it's greatness."

        "review_detailed_main": "Starts off like a coming of age type film for some wannabe bad girls who want nothing more than to hook up with boys at spring break, and that's how the filmmaking portrays that. But, interestingly it switches gears into a sort of filmmaking that resembles memory, with repeated dialogue voice-overs and random dream-like editing. The film does something pretty cool which was a gamble, creating a neon fantasy where these girls come into a situation that allows them to do whatever they want, good or bad. Franco's character originally starts off almost gimmicky and stereotypical but slowly becomes tamed by the girls and quite enjoyable to watch."

The acting, the directing, and the plot are all completely non-existent. oh, OK so that's not completely true there is a minuscule amount of acting involved but he rest is true, though! This is such a confusing messed up film that I, for once, cannot begin to give you a really decent review. Sorry! Every min plot line in the film raises many more questions than it answers. Now I don't mind watching films that leave me with more questions at the end, just so long as the film is a good or better film, Existenz is a great example of a great film that leaves you with questions at the end and those questions add to the experience, the pleasure and the enjoyment of the film. Spring Break, however, is a truly, truly dreadful film and the questions it leaves all of the way through do the complete opposite. And how they manage to do that with a film so utterly atrocious is, I suppose, a miracle in it'self. the miracle being that a totally and utterly atrocious film that has absolutely nothing good about it whatsoever has so many holes in it the holes have (somehow) made it worse! But then do we viewers need a miracle such as that? I'm guessing the director, the producer, the writer, the actors and everyone else involved with getting this film made did and that that was what they were striving for. If that is the case, if that is what they were striving for then they all hit the mark perfectly!"

Eventually, it was as good as I had imagined and I enjoyed it. The plot of the movie was very interesting and mysterious, but not innovative because there are many movies similar to this one. The storyline was kinda well-written and well-explained, even though it was simple and easy to understand. The characters were very interesting and well-developed, but they weren't really likeable (except, Faith). The casting choices were great and their performances were excellent, the four girls did a great job of portraying their characters. I have to admit, it was a very intense movie (especially, the final part) and there were some action-filled moments. The opening scene was predictable, fast-paced and full of nude people, lol. In my opinion, the cinematography and the score of the movie were both probably the best thing about the movie. The ending scene was kinda predictable, intense and it was just fine. Overall, \"Spring Breakers\" was a nice teen drama film, very sexy, intense and I would probably recommend it to my friends."

The result is a movie with a twelve year old main actress and James Franco in a paedophiliac role, which is definitely under his level. The beginning is really dull and soporific. The Spring Break at all is shown for about 15 - 20 minutes and isn't really genuine, only naked breasts doesn't occupy the image at all. The gangster storyline isn't credible, and with this girls in it, ridiculous. The end of film isn't surprising, the expected happened. The repetitive statements from the story teller are more then bugging. The result: Save your time, this movie is a worth of every second."

        "review_detailed_main": "OK, so I saw \"Spring Breakers\" last night at the Gothenburg Film Festival and it's still fresh in my mind. My first reaction was one of absolute elation after witnessing an extraordinary piece of transcendental art. The film feels somehow beyond the postmodern dichotomy of good/bad or high/low - rather - it reads like some sort of hyper-simulacrum that reflects contemporary culture in an extremely complex manner. The themes of the film are similar to what Korine has touched upon before: mundane reality vs. an intense \"heightened\" or elevated existence beyond good or evil, where reality is replaced by a (or the) dream that goes on forever and ever. But in \"Spring Breakers\" those themes are presented in more dimensions than in for example \"Mister Lonely\" or \"Trash Humpers\".\n\nThe liquid colorful cinematography is spectacular throughout, though some scenes especially stand out, for example the robbery and the montage that goes along with Britney Spears \"Everytime\", spectacular examples of great art. There is a method of repetition that runs through the film (which I'm sure will annoy quite a few people), dialogue is repeated, scenes are repeated, images are repeated, the sound of a gun being loaded (used brilliantly as poetic punctuation) is repeated - every time eschewing the original meaning of said occurrence - thereby adding another level of analytical value and another point to the already complex sentiments. It really speaks volumes of contemporary culture where the \"dreams\" of the populace is nothing but representation and spectacle in its purest form. With \"Spring Breakers\" Korine has really managed to reflect, deconstruct and subvert (the way the great fun of it also becomes the grim menace of it, I find genuinely subversive) what some might see as banal popular culture and escapism and turn it into radical poetic hyper-cinema, and I truly found that masterful.\n\nI look forward to the general reaction to the film once it gets a wide release, but I doubt it will be a hit with either mainstream audiences or bourgeoisie film critics. I think it will appeal mainly to fans of art-house exploitation or experimental genre-cinema."

The plot was OK and had potential.I think it was lost in the directing and Artsy camera filming. Not Just the modern shaky camera tricks, but the whole movie was filmed in some sort of dream sequence with flashes to the beach parties every two minutes and random flash backs, flash sideways, flash forwards constantly through out. Yes there was a lot of implied sex and plenty of naked women flashes. But the constant flashes of sex, nudity, drugs was a bit like watching some psychedelic MTV video that are nothing but random flashes of random body parts bouncing,drug use,implied sex, guns, violence. They also managed to make all the sexy flashes dark and depressing. Defiantly not something kids should see. Those of you adults that just plan to watch it for the sexy girls and nudity flashes. You might even find yourself board and tired of all the random flashes very quickly.Even the constant music through the movie got annoying. Was like some hypnotizing whale calls or something. Not a pleasant sound and it did not stop at all. I really wanted to like this movie, All the way to the end I wanted to like it. It was just dark, weird and depressing."

The content of the movie would probably last about 30 minutes if they didn't do all the weird annoying cinematography in between every scene. This movie is the epitome of pop culture and it is absolutely horrible. Don't waste your time or money on this trashy film. I have no idea how this movie has a rating of over 5.

The only message that I could discern was that nudity and swearing fill in time in a movie with nothing to say. How actors like Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, and Ashley Benson were enticed into this cesspit is beyond reason. If they had guidance in selecting the roles they should find new guides. This movie needs another classification other than \"rotten tomatoes\". How about rancid offal.

I mean I can understand why so many people hate it, it's an easy film to criticise, it's not perfect by any means, but at the same time there's a very special meaning to much of it which is delivered in a very different way to other meaningful films. I think that this message is hugely overlooked in this film and as such this work bludgeoned by film goers. To me this film is an aesthetic tug against our fast paced, vulgar and narcissistic society. It provides a subtle and neat critique of all that is wrong with our modern selves; the now factor, the psychopathic lack of remorse for actions, the party as hard as you can, the vulgarity and tackiness of the pursuit of money. These are topics that the film handles well.\n\nIt's certainly not your everyday film, in fact I'd go as far to say that this is one of the weirdest things that I've ever seen. This is a film that you should see; love it or hate, you won't forget it. It's a marmite film, but hell, who forgets about marmite? Never the less, I'd remark that this is an important film with an important message at the right time. In summary, it's overlooked and deserves a viewing."

Kinda of disappointing for a movie titles \"spring breakers, especially since they don't' show up until 40 minutes into the movie.\n\nThere are so many loose ends and non-closing story lines\n\nFaith bows out of the movie after being creeped out by Alien. We never heard from her again. They make a big deal about robbing a diner (and how much money does a diner have on hand? Apparently enough to rent a condo, 4 scooters and transportation to Florida)\n\nThe director's wife plays Cotty, who flashes boobs, has sex on screen takes a bullet in the arm, then also heads home.\n\nThere is a buildup of a former friendship between the rival gang leaders. Barely addressed, and concluded when they are both shot by lackeys IN A MONTAGE sequence.\n\nLiterally 70% of the movie is montage sequences, and dialog from earlier in the movie being repeated over and over, over some horrible out of date trance music.\n\nThe plot is non existent. I have a feeling they too the 5 million budget and used it as an excuse to go to Florida/Italy for vacation, and for the director to get access to as many boobs as possible, and to cram his wife into a movie.\n\nTerrible terrible terrible to the last.

        "review_detailed_main": "I was debating if I should give it a 6 or 7.\n\nPlease someone help me understand.\n\nFirst, my credentials. Film student. Very much into art house films. I love when films go to extremes. There is not one theme which I find disturbing. My mind works (nicely I would add). I appreciate the visual nature of films, but my main area of interest belongs to the insights and thoughts behind a movie.\n\nSo now... This are my takes for Mr. Korine:\n\n1. Mr. Korine is nihilistic in nature, and wanted to say that anyone can and should do whatever they want if it fulfills their needs, and brings happiness. Spring break being completely hedonistic, selfish, and irrational.\n\n2. Mr. Korine is an intellectual outcast, that wanted to point out, with a satire, that the people that are involved in this kind of behaviour do not belong to the smart and prosperous society that we have envisioned. They are animalistic, without depth and awareness of existence; and they should be laughed at.\n\n3. Mr. Korine is a simple moral thinker, that wanted to make a film that will entice people to see it (look at the marketing strategy for the film) and then reveal a dramatic story, where we witness the corruption of youth and the sad extremes they can reach.\n\n4. Mr. Korine is childish with his filmmaking. Thought about a very simple story about slutty girls that transform into bad ass bitches. Carried it through and never gave it much thought.\n\nI could think about more conclusions for Korine, but I am tired. I got interested in the film because watching the actresses, and watching that Korine was directing, I thought this was going to be an over the top satire (which I would have loved.) Korine doesn't seem like the moral kind either, and this message was not well given, if it was his original intention. I know there are plenty reasons why a film turns out the way it does. It isn't always in a directors reach; so all my opinions are based on the idea that he had a purpose and accomplished it.\n\nMy best bet is between points 1 and 4. No.1 is the one that works best, but also seem unlikely. If this was his message, it was not carried through appropriately, and not understandable. Most likely is point no. 4. Nice visuals. I'll give them that. Poor execution. I don't understand why directors refuse to give insight on the purpose/message of the film. It would be much more easier to evaluate them that way. Without real content a film is empty/unnecessary, like this one.\n\nMy question in the beginning was honest, please tell me which one you believe it was. If you have another idea, tell me. Send me a message. Have a nice one everybody."

        "review_detailed_main": "Understandably, the film wakes much rejection. A quick view or not reflective enough can mislead us to believe that it is superficial. On the contrary, Harmony Korine's film is a bitter satire (at times cynical) about the American youth culture and, in large part, global. The shallowness of the characters is deliberate. The three crazy travelers do evil in pure boredom, the banality of evil is presented here in an ironic contrast to the free and unlimited sexuality and drug use, the Holy Grial of these girls. At times, the three chicks seem the witches of Macbeth, messengers of death and emptiness. Harmony Korine is a moralist, his film denounces the horror that lurks behind the glamour of drugs and free love. But Korine delivers his message with a style that copies and reproduces the mechanisms of fashion, so that a teenager is attracted yet shocked by what you see on the screen. Watching this movie, it is impossible not to remember Less Than Zero, the novel that enabled Bret Easton Ellis earn his place under the California sun. The state of affairs is certainly catastrophic for Korine: a. The pursuit of happiness is reduced to get lost in a perpetual orgy. b. The perpetual orgy is slightly threatened only by religious zealots as the only challenging force. c. No more parents and adults, no more institutions concerned with the physical and mental health of its citizens. d. Youngsters' paradise is depicted as one of the many faces of hell."

        "review_detailed_main": "I think this is a good movie, but I'm not really sure. It's a weird little slice of American hedonism wrapped in an (at times) aestheticly pleasing package. That being said, the plot hardly exists. The characters mainly do drugs and have sex, and that's about it. Nobody puts on an outstanding performance, but James Franco is the highlight. He plays a decent caricature of a drug-dealing rapper. This character is a wholesale ripoff of the image and persona of a real rapper by the name of Riff Raff, and I found myself wishing the role was played by the man himself. Gucci Mane puts on an interesting performance as the film's short-lived antagonist.\n\nI really don't know what to say. This film could have been great. I like how unashamed it is in its mantra of style over substance, but it has such little substance or originality that it remains unmemorable. I think the ending sequence is an appropriately ridiculous ending for a ridiculous movie. It's kind of a stupid movie, but I don't think it's for stupid people. I don't know. I enjoyed it.\n\n(I've heard people say it's supposed to be a brilliantly self-aware, disposable piece of entertainment. How it's supposed to be a commentary on the impermanence of pop culture, and the degenerate lifestyles pursued by hedonistic youth. However, I didn't get that impression as I watched the movie. Once I watch this director's other films, perhaps I will rewatch Spring Breakers with this viewpoint in mind.)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Brit, Candy, Cotty, and Faith have been best friends since grade school. They live together in a boring college dorm and are hungry for adventure. They rob a restaurant in order to fund their spring break vacation and shenanigans begin. They land in jail and find themselves bailed out by a drug and arms dealer who wants them to do some dirty work in exchange for all the thrill and excitement they could hope for. With the encouragement of their new friend, it soon becomes unclear how far the girls are willing to go to experience a spring break they will never forget.\n\nI entered the dark theater and descended into a black hole of corruption and filth when I watched Harmny Korine's Spring Breakers almost two weeks ago. There was something about the film that looked intriguing despite their being a lot of bad press, and being a big James Franco fan I knew I had to see it, so I went to its last screening in my area. Spring Breakers was an on screen explosion of neon, Skrillex, nudity, sex and drugs. But when you peal away its barely there bikini you realize it is actually so much more; including a metaphor for Britney Spears' total breakdown. It's a bleak view regarding the ills of our society and the increasingly perverse nature of its youth.\n\nThis is the first film of Korine's to be released to a wide audience. Due to the fact that it is so dramatically different from your average big cinema adventure, and because of Korine's specific style I don't think the casual moviegoer would like this film. There is a lot to take in, and many layers to uncover that on the surface just comes off as weird.\n\nAt first glance it just looks like you are watching the college party scene taken to an extreme level with a lot of people getting drunk, girls bouncing their naked chests, vulgar language and other trashiness. It is not until you let it all soak in and let it marinade with you a couple of days (or in my case over a week) that you can truly fathom the point of the film. You have to look at it in a deeper level and in a symbolic way to really understand it and appreciate it.\n\nTo read the rest of the review and to read more film reviews visit Breakaway Daily: http://breakawaydaily.com"

A total and utter waste of 94 minutes of my life. I would recommend this film be destroyed and forgotten about so I can no longer scar and destroy people's lives!! Also to think the girls came from a Disney background to end up playing messed up teenagers just makes the movie so much more cringeworthy. This film would have been a lot better if it had a story line like normal films do, a proper script rather than a load of garbage spraying out of their mouths frequently ended by them scream \"spring breakerssss\"."

Not in any way comparing this movie to those, just saying it amazes me how as soon as someone does something different, or stray from the norm people who don't get it just trash it. Nas said people fear what they don't understand, and I realize how true that is now. IMDb has movies like Momento at 35 on their top 250 list. I've honestly never posted here, but was really taken back to see people dis the same imagery that that gave stars to in some of the older classics. Idk maybe its just me.Im not saying that I'm in love with this film but it is definitely worth watching. The development of the characters was for sh*t but it definitely gives a perspective and story line that is rarely seen. You should check it out."

My suggestion if you are hellbent on watching this for the greasy and generally unappealing nekkid bits is to turn the volume all the way down so at least you won't be assaulted by the moronic dialog and insipid acting.\n\nMy suggestion, go see \"Kids\", which was written by the same person who wrote and directed this film.

        "review_detailed_main": "From the writer/director of \"Gummo\" comes\u0085For many of you, that's probably all you needed to know in order to be dissuaded from seeing \"Spring Breakers\". That said, for as much as I hated EVERY SINGLE ONE of Harmony Korine's prior films, \"Spring Breakers\", starring James Franco, Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson and even Gucci Mane, while problematic, is more than just ex-Disney channel girls in bikinis or boobs for days. The story Korine attempts to tell actually has a lot of potential, in conjunction with some beautiful camera work and underscored with a fascinating script. It's just too bad that he almost ruins it, simply because he can't get out of his own way.\n\nThe Story: \"Spring Breakers\" is a tale of two halves. In the first half, which belongs to Selena Gomez's character Faith, we get a story about four college girls whose goal is to have the most memorable spring break imaginable. This particular storyline is quite strong, with an interesting \"pure girl corrupted by the big city\" motif. But once James Franco's character Alien, a more thugged-out version of Kevin Federline takes the reins (about 45 minutes in) that particular storyline goes right out the window. The second half follows this white rap sensation, as he sets out to corrupt these girls (or maybe it's the other way around). But while the latter half of this film is forcibly injected with a shot of adrenaline, headlined by a larger than life performance from Franco, it unfortunately contains such flawed storytelling, that it all becomes a bit tiresome, repetitive and just downright weird; especially during a scene of simulated oral sex and a montage scored by James Franco singing a Britney Spears ballad, that is sure to have audiences snickering in disbelief. Here are a few more issues with this film: 1.And this is a problem which plagues almost all of Korine's past films. There is only about 30 minutes of actual plot here. Not to say that the 30 minutes isn't well thought out, but by default everything else comes off as an overlong, desensitizing music video montage, set to repeat. This aspect may be the most detrimental to the viewing experience because it causes a 94 minute film to seem like a 120 minutes, as \"Spring Breakers\" overstays its welcome.\n\n2.As I mentioned before, Korine has a nasty habit of not being able to get out of his own way. In the case of \"Spring Breakers\" this translates into Korine's Spike Lee-ish tendency to stop the progression of his story dead in its tracks, in order to make continuous points. This technique of pumping the breaks on a film to make a point about sexuality, or violence or violent sexuality, or sexuality in violence, completely takes audiences out of the film, and slowly mutilates the plot. In short, as Korine stops to make more and more visual points with extensive montages, the more audiences completely forget about the story itself.\n\n3.As creative as I thought this storyline to be, it still doesn't erase the fact that the situations and dialogues Korine creates are overwhelmingly exaggerated in order to make a point everyone in the audience should already be aware of. Example: In \"Gummo\" he makes his white trash characters extremely physically and emotionally filthy; or extremely white trash, and in \"Spring Breakers\" he makes his skanks skanky to the extreme, by putting them in constant states of undress, no matter what the situation. But we get it already! I don't need another boob montage.\n\n4.Being an admitted hater of the High-Defness in movies of today, when Korine makes a movie like \"Spring Breakers\", which, at times, looks like a big budget Michael Bay film, and uses Top 40 hits as his soundtrack, he is obviously trying to make a condescending point about beauty and the American culture of today. But to your average viewer who hasn't had the displeasure of sitting through \"Julien Donkey-Boy\" or \"Trash Humpers\", \"Spring Breakers\" may come across as uncomfortably free formed and simply too strange, with no context to pull from.\n\nThe Acting: With all of its flaws, the acting from Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens was a high point within some of the messier portions of this film. But the real star of the show is Franco, in a performance which admittedly took me a few minutes to get into, but ends up as the best performance of his career; and maybe worth the price of admission alone.\n\nFinal Thought: Writer/director Harmony Korine is essentially the creepy kid with the camera from \"American Beauty\". He claims to be attempting to find beauty amidst the filth of the world, but in reality he comes off as a provocateur/non-conformist, who seems to have a distain for the subjects in his films. And that all would be fine, if he just presented a coherent story, that wasn't disjointed with his form of ultra experimental filmmaking. With that said, \"Spring Breakers\" is Korine's most accessible film, with his most coherent (and deepest) storyline to date. So, while I thought a lot of this film was too over-the-top for its own good, there is stuff here that I liked very much; enough to recommend that people see this film, but only if you know what to expect.\n\nWritten by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

I only started to watch this because critics gave it a good score. I only watched half an hour of this film and bailed. This movie has an unnecessary amount of nudity. You cannot go through fifteen minutes of this film without seeing nudity. The music is just remixed mainstream music which is alright. You might as well just get the soundtrack. The Casting is unforgivable. I couldn't get over the fact that a star who is most famous for her Disney roles is smoking and drinking and doing bad stuff. That's something for her private life, not the silver screen. James Franco's career would have been over after this movie if it wasn't for his alternate movie This Is The End. Do not waste your money with this movie it is rubbish unless you are a sick, horny guy with a fetish for young Disney girls."

        "review_detailed_main": "As, I walked out of the theatre of Spring Breakers, I was awestruck. I had just seen another masterpiece from writer/director Harmony Korine, whose films and work I have admired since my early teenage years. I consider him to be one of the best writer/directors working today and one of the most unique visionaries and geniuses behind a camera that we have in an industry filled with Hollywood blockbusters that are clich\u00e9 and overloaded with special effects as well as remake after remake being shelled out. It's such a breath of fresh air to see another great original film by Korine. To some, Spring Breakers will seem like pure and simple exploitation and it will be dismissed as trash. How further from the truth could those people be. This is a cautionary tale of young college/university age girls who go for a wild time on their spring break that leads to a lot of immoral behaviour, attitudes and ways of thinking, that is unfortunately all too common among today's youth of today. Yes, the film does show scenes of wild parties and sex, drugs, violence and all the nihilistic antics popular today and of yesteryear. The film is graphic in it's depiction, which may lead some to classify it as an exploitation film, but I found by showing us an unflinchingly graphic, hopeless and disturbing group of people doing a lot of bad and inappropriate behaviour was crucial to this story and the message that was trying to be delivered and was delivered successfully. The film shows these girls as na\u00efve and bored with everyday life. They don't seem to pay attention much in school and it really does not seem all that important to them. Their lives seem so empty with little, or no love being shown to them and no moral compass, or guidance to steer them in the right direction. Because their lives are empty of anything meaningful, or of substance, these girls conform to the out of control antics that are the ruin of today's youth and a path that will only lead to more and more trouble and destruction. It's fascinating to see how each one of these girls comes to this. The one girl in particular does have somewhat of a life invested in faith and others do show that somehow what is going on around them is not right. The film is quite disturbing by showing us just how low and depraved they can get, but like Korine's penned Kids, it is also a wake up call both to parents and young people alike. The character played by James Franco, who goes by the name \"Alien\", is also a lost person trying to base his whole existence on the failed life philosophy of living big and dying young by filling up life with drugs, sex, violence and living a life without any real responsibility, or guidance other than that of Al Pacino in Scarface, and other failed gangsters. The film shows how pathetic all these people's new found lifestyles really are and that they will not make them rich, happy, or better in any possible way and the film makes us feel that they are utterly and completely hopeless and that is the point. It's a disturbing yet powerful display of at risk youth which is also a very thought provoking experience as well. James Franco steals the show as Alien, and does a very good job here playing a character who thinks he's much larger and more important than he really is. He is often amusing and pathetic to watch and I mean that in a good way. Kudos to Franco for a great spot on performance. The girls themselves are all quite good here as well. There is much more to their performances than meets the eye and I felt they delivered. The film has a unique and appropriate visual style of bright neon lights and fast jump cutting editing which works very well here. The film's score by Cliff Martinez, who also did the fantastic score for Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive, does a great one here too that completely suit's the film's story and visual style. While the film is full of despair and pity, it is also very entertaining in the sense that I could not take my eyes off the screen and really wanted to keep watching with it's haunting yet almost beautifully eerie style and way of storytelling. This is not a mainstream film, so a lot of people will leave feeling let down. However, for fans of Harmony Korine's other great films in his body of work and anyone at all interested in a stylish, haunting and thought provoking film, will want to see this. This is the best film so far this year and while the year is young much like these girls, I know it will be one of my favorites still by year end."

        "review_detailed_main": "Four hot down on their luck girls, bikini beauties, resort to robbing a restaurant to pay for a spring break in good ol' Florida. This is familiar territory for Korine, recurring flashbacks, flash forward shots amidst a lot of profane if repeated dialogue (Spring breeaaaaak. Spring breaaaaak). Also it has thankfully a lot of, sex, nudity and cleavage, one shot if I was not mistaken, featured a guy getting s..ked off. These four girls almost out of high school, but stuck in this dead end town, yearn for this break, where it comes as a godsend. After getting arrested for noisy behavior at a loud party, they're bailed out by Alien- a wealthy drug dealer, avid rapper, budding pianist, and you should see all the s**t he's got in his pad, where's he quick and proud to brag about it, which makes for one of the funny scenes. Although SB has more drama about it, it does have an uncomfortable and a sadness about these girls, you really wanna see got do the right path. The party pooper, the hot Gomez, a church goer, bails out on them, returning to her dead town existence. You'll actually think she might return later but doesn't. Franco who takes the girls in, like candy to a baby, though Gomez sees above his act, which really it isn't, when you get to know his character better, vows vengeance on a former friend/drug dealer, after the second beauty is wounded and heads in the same direction as Gomez. Franco is the one savior of the film, a serious, seriously good actor, where we're sure to see much more impressive stuff from this guy. This film could of seriously plummeted without his performance. The shooting montage scene, against his piano playing/singing track of a ten year old Brittany Spears track, I liked very much, stays in my head, it was quite a surprise to hear this particular song. This movie is worth the view for the obvious birdwatcher, but really this one, which is something different, doesn't have much potency to it, where we could of delved deeper into these girl's characters and problems, where too many shots of bouncing boobies, or bikini's, got in the way. Not that's there's nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong with that at all."

The script must be 15 pages, because it's the same repetitive nonsense in voice over, over and over again! It's editing was as is it was needing to just fill time, and it's all over the place ( hey let just throw random shots and tits ). Literally, literally nothing happens for an hour! And if u hear James Franco did a good job, just ignore them! His character isn't believable, at times u think, eh he's not doing a bad job and then ...then it's garbage. I give the cinematography some props, but then it keeps going and then it's over done and you just want something to happen. I had a head ache watching this! You know those laughable horrible B/C role type movies, where they're so bad you make fun of the movie, well this isn't one of them. There's only been one other movie I felt was near this bad, House of the Dead. The thing is I like the girls in the movie, but it's a trash movie (I have no better/appropriate adjectives, than \"trash/garbage\", for how bad it is). I gave this a 1 on my scale.....oh and....it has Gucci Mane! Worst rapper actor ever! If you want to watch a good sustainable, beautifully shot film with a Story, go watch Stoker."

Lord knows a black thug using some white girls would not only look inappropriate but will send so much outcry to stop this movie even making the cinema.

I feel like I know what the filmmaker is trying to do, from the style, the cast, the story (or lack of). And I like what I think he has in mind. It's just that the actual film doesn't deliver. It doesn't take me to that special place.\n\nJames Franco is a nice plus and he kind-of brings the film together somehow. But still I cannot help but wanting to laugh because I don't trust him as an actor anymore. I'm not sure if he's actually making fun of his role or not. His own real life persona makes him too meta to be believable in any movie roles, especially in a 'fantasy' film like this, which maybe is the whole point of the film.\n\nI feel like this movie was conceived out of images in the director's mind; young beautiful women in colorful bikinis with guns and gangsters. Perfect for good poster and trailer. Not so much for a movie though."

        "review_title": "Unlike Any Other Spring Break Imaginable",
        "review_detailed_main": "Filmmaker Harmony Korine has often been revered for his erratic and transgressive movies that explore taboo subject matter in a highly experimental fashion. One of his more mainstream features has to be the 2012 comedy crime film Spring Breakers, starring the likes of James Franco, Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hedges, Ashley Benson and Rachel Korine. Known as one of the first releases from then brand new indie company A24, the film went on to gross gangbusters compared to its small budget and garnered just enough praise to be considered a cult classic. Looking at the film nowadays, although it's certainly not for everyone, there is a lot to admire in its exploration of self destruction in the modern day.\n\nThe film follows four college-aged girls who visit St. Petersburg, Florida on their spring break, only to get arrested for abusing narcotics. After getting saved by an eccentric drug dealer named Alien, the girls end up descending into a bizarre world of drugs, crime and violence. As this is a social commentary on millennial superficiality and pop culture exploitation, Spring Breakers is both a tribute and satirization of the self-destructive themes it is tackling. Perhaps it does indulge in the pop culture obscenities a little too much in the first act, which isn't helped that the film's pacing can get tirelessly repetitive after a while. Now the established contrast between the leads Brit, Candy and Cotty being party animals and Faith being a part of a religious youth group does work in favor of the character's financial difficulty, but them actually getting to Florida takes a bit longer than it really should have. Even once they get to Florida, their indulgence in partying and drug abuse gets too overwhelming to the point of near nausea, and the length of time it takes to showcase this will really polarize anyone's viewing experience. So needless to say, the first act is a bit too much to handle, even if that's what Korine was going for to show us what kind of media that millennials tend to get into.\n\nHowever, once Alien comes into the picture, the film immediately picks up and becomes far more interesting and intense than meets the eye. As Alien is a \"cool boy\" white gangster complete with all kinds of crazy gear and narcotics, he is proven to be far out of this world, which leads the girls to engage in his antics and also feel uncomfortable at the same time. In addition, James Franco pulls off such an intimidatingly crazy performance as Alien that you almost wonder if he practically became the character during the making of the movie. There aren't a whole lot of other characters to take note of, but rapper Gucci Mane makes for a strong opposer as Alien's childhood friend turned drug rival Archie, which proves to be another turn on by the aforementioned party girls. What's interesting to note is that the film has often been debated whether it is pro misogynist or feminist, but considering that the girls end up taking over more in Alien's crib than one might expect, there's much to argue that the leads are really just enjoying their spring break while they can without completely succumbing to the drug hustling world. At the end of the day, these girls are taking charge of their own lives, even down to triumphing over a scary drug kingpin in the most unimaginable way.\n\nAs far as other qualities are concerned, the cinematography is as intense as the themes presented throughout the film, down to practically becoming a character in its own regard. In displaying just how unhinged college students might end up getting through unadulterated fun, the camera showcases as much glamour as it wants in displaying all of the uncomfortable vices that one would expect in these types of scenarios. The editing also helps to make many scenes feel like extensive trips so that the audience knows what they're getting into is far more wild of a ride than they might assume. It's saying how much this is an arthouse film disguised as a comedy crime thriller when James Franco's poetry juxtaposing with certain events happening on screen adds into the intentionally off putting tone shown across the runtime. Lastly, the soundtrack slaps in more ways than one, which can be attributed to the talents of composers Cliff Martinez and EDM musician Skrillex lending their talents to the wildness of the whole film. The soundtrack not only feels appropriate to the time when this film came out, but it proves just how intense a lot of young adults and late teens will eat this kind of work up without knowing the repercussions of their extensive partying.\n\nSo while Spring Breakers is not at all what one might expect from mere assumptions, its erratic social commentary on late millennial culture and gripping performances from the lead cast make it as intense as it is fascinating. Unless you're not the intended audience that this film is clearly made for, I would recommend checking this film out at least once just to see how unapologetic it is in both tone and content. As of now, Harmony Korine is developing a sequel to this extravagant mindgame, so by all means give it a go if you feel ready to do so. You might have to go back to school or work after it's all done, but there's a good chance that you will always remember this trip of a movie."

And it was kind of that, but far more different and dizzingly interesting. Most of the film feels like a wild , intoxicating night and a cash-grap videoclip of a rapper. It is so extreme and stylisticly inconsistent that it is of no surprise that it got pretty mixed reviews. Although it s at times dizzy and just does whatever it wants with its characters and at others a clever, let-loose satire about the American Dream, it is for sure an experience.\n\nThe film has this \"loss of innocence\" vibe and it the cast really supports that feeling. The actresses are all Disney girls and they a pretty good job with their performances, though they were kind of annoying while they where crying. It is a film that does not know excactly what it wants to be or say. It is for sure bold and risky and sexy and colourful and works as a satirical illustration of those who dream so big and fall so down,a weird song made for the American Nation and for the so-called \"American Dream\".\n\nIt often gets lost and they repat a lot of the dialogue and I am sure that Korine should have been high for the most of the filming process. James Franco was probably the best part of the film. He was fun and got in the role of a \"successful\" American gangster. You was really entertaining, y'all.\n\nThe cinematography was also well-done, except for a couple of distracting moments. Oh, and the \"Everytime\" scene was perfect.\n\nIn the end I am sill not sure about this film. I guess its originality and funkiness make it a good, fun watch, but it is totally understandable if you don't like it or even hate it. 6 or 7 out of 10. Still dizzed and chilled after watching it."

First of all you don't who the main character is, because at one point of the movie everybody is narrating, and they're narration makes no sense. Second there is an antagonist but you don't know who is the protagonist.

I think those things can be appreciated, but it does have a lot of issues despite that. It's way too short and in turn, things are missing. Most of the characters aren't flushed out well, some inconsistencies come into play, some things are just crammed in, and it feels rushed at times. There are also way too many shots of breast's and butts for no reason, it's just kind of weird. I think this film had a really good concept going, it's just kind of sad that it didn't go all the way. I rate Spring Breakers a 6.5/10."

This film is shot, scripted and acted as if everyone is high on pot. It's aesthetic and tone is of a stoned person. He probably wrote it when high but the real beauty is that the entire sensibility is captured beautifully. The character actions and motivations too are influenced by the drug it seems. So you don't get surprised when Alien falls in love with these girls all at once. The girls themselves are in a haze and their actions reflect that. All and all a beautiful marijuana trip."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's no good way to sum up the story as there isn't one to begin with. But is it a character driven piece then, you might ask? Well, the supposed characters' motivation is \"bikini\" and there isn't much development from there. Three of the girls are completely interchangeable party girls, and the fourth is a devout Christian named Faith - that's just how subtle this movie is.\n\nThe movie goes out of its way to be edgy. Drugs! Violence! Nudity! Controversy!!! Of course, casting Disney pop tarts in the leads is a sly and surefire way to get some publicity (and, of course, the magic word controversy), and I imagine the Disney princesses are happy to do anything to break out of the mouse house fold.\n\nThe visual aesthetic is quite tiresome. Hand-held camera, long lenses, every other shot is an ECU, non-linear editing. This movie couldn't be much more artsy fartsy if it even tried. (Well, perhaps if they skipped all the pastels and neons and shot it in black & white with the dialogue in Polish. But I don't want to give Harmony Korine any ideas.)\n\nHad this movie been made and shot in the exact same way by some other director, like a Brett Ratner, Michael Bay or Justin Lin, it would most likely have been slammed for being exploitative and the directors called dirty old men for letting the camera linger endlessly on the scantily bikini clad bodies of these Disney barely legals. But since this movie is made by Harmony Korine, it's critic proof.\n\nSome have talked about the \"social commentary\" supposedly hiding in this film. But when asked to specify exactly what they mean, they are dumbstruck. People who don't like this movie are supposedly too dumb to get it. I get it. Spring Breakers had as much social commentary as a Girls Gone Wild video, and it managed to be far less entertaining.\n\nThis was one of the worst movies I have seen this year."

        "review_detailed_main": "Harmony Korine is an auteur. His films are entirely his own, which leads one into utter confusion when he switches gears from dirty white trash cinema into an unexpectedly profound Spring Break experience. This film is definitely not for the traditional audience of its stars, as it depicts its actresses in an entirely different light than what they became famous for. In no way are these characters friendly child pop icons anymore, but darkly tragic criminals, placed into a surprise journey of danger, indulgence, love, and self-discovery.\n\nIt sounds weird, doesn't it? Certainly not the movie most people would expect, though this movie does a fine job in destroying these child- stars' family images and proving they have potential to be serious actresses, even if this movie presents them as students who just want to have a good Spring Break. It's more than that. They want a life-changing Spring Break, and here it is.\n\nLike many of Harmony Korine's films, this one is a visual collage of events, though there is a most definite storyline underneath this, unlike many of this other films. Despite it's extreme contrast to his other movies, it is still 100% a Harmony Korine movie in the sense of its abstract structure and style, only a lot more focused and visually stunning. This is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen due to its surreal neon party atmosphere, its extremely moody vibes and music, and of course, its bikini-clad characters who don't change their clothes very often, and that's a good thing.\n\nJames Franco is almost unrecognizable in this role, because he plays such a unique character compared to anything else he's done, but he gives an absolutely phenomenal performance and completely steals the show as the hilarious and endearing gangster with the heart of gold.\n\nAs a fan of Harmony Korine's work, I was expecting to like the movie, but the promotion of this movie doesn't prepare you for the trip it takes you on. The film retains the director's hypnotic charm, yet it completely shatters and reinvents his whole style of film, as well as the teenybopper images of its stars by giving this movie a surprising amount of depth and dare I say coherence. Not only is it my absolute new favorite of Harmony Korine's, but perhaps the most beautiful 90 minute experience I've ever witnessed.\n\nI think this movie is going to stick with me for a very long time."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Spring Breakers\" takes the spring break vacation and turns it on its head. It's about everything that spring break represents and nothing it represents all at the exact same time. Four college girls do in fact go to Florida for spring break; they do in fact wear bikinis, get drunk, and do drugs. The film isn't lying when they say that's what it's about. But it takes that culture and places it in a whole new genre.\n\nFor starters, this is a drama not a comedy. The movie's enthusiasts who got everything out of it that Harmony Korine was trying to say may refer to it as a comedy in the sense that the film makes fun of how that culture is revered in our current society. But there isn't a laugh to be found, and there isn't meant to be any. Others will laugh because it's so ridiculous. But that depends on your frame of reference on watching.\n\nIf you're expecting these girls to behave similarly to anybody you have ever met, then you will find it ridiculous. How quickly they go from their boring college lives to the dark recesses of the human psyche, is shocking and extreme. And probably ridiculous to some. But this film is better than others of its kind because these are wholly unique characters \u2013 we've never seen them in a movie like this before. As the film goes on, we're never sure if they're in over their heads, or if they're about to turn the Floridian spring break hot spot on its head.\n\nThree of the girls start out as pretty despicable people (the other one is religious). Their actions are bad but then their situation gets worse and that's when the plot, or let's call that character study, starts getting interesting. The girls meet Alien (James Franco) \u2013 a rapper, spring break gangster and philosopher. His name is Alien because he's an alien \u2013 in his own philosophical way. He's also unlike Franco as you've ever seen him before. He's probably unlike most actors as you've ever seen before.\n\nThere are a lot of interesting power dynamics along with the dark but powerful evolution to the girls (or at least three of the girls). Sometimes what the film has to say can get lost amongst all the gratuitous shots of naked girls, alcohol and hard-core drug use. We're also almost 30 minutes into the film before the story gets moving and it becomes apparent that the plot is a character study of these girls \"finding themselves.\"\n\nThe film is likely just going to be one of many extremely divisive films from 2013. \"Spring Breakers\" breaks the mold of spring break films and presents us with a film that is dark, dirty, and disgusting. At one glance it is completely unrealistic, but at a second glance these girls might be more frighteningly real than we would like to believe. On the surface, the film was everything that I hate, but I really liked it. It's a story that doesn't seem familiar even if it has been told before, but it has never been told in this setting before. And for that reason I do think \"Spring Breakers\" needs to be seen from all cinephiles alike."

In other words plenty of films prove shallow - something which, as we all know, is easy to do; this one shows vacuous culture and lifestyle, through processes of absurdity - think Franco on the bed with his firearms - no doubt aided by moments of improvisation, in a way that echoes the message. There's a human tendency to seek inherent value and meaning in life and this film leaves the audience alone to find any, as we watch unique and bizarre individuals in a distinctly hollow subculture. By this director Harmony Konne, who also made Gummo and Kids , shows a world that is flashy and trivial (albeit with striking moments) through a crime drama with an over-the-type James Franco in party mood and, indeed, parties and party-folk everywhere. (A 'party' of course has more than one meaning) The film was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 69th Venice International Film Festival. Despite my above words, on the looking for meaning in his films Korine states, \"I think people will lose the film as soon as they start trying to figure out my logic or what I'm doing or while they're watching it start to dissect metaphors... I'm not really so interested in it working on a purely cerebral level. I'm much more concerned with it on an emotional level and that you leave feeling a certain way\".

I expected the gratuitous ... it opened with an extended \"Girls Gone Wild\" sequence. But then it showed that sequence again, and again and again, then again, and again and again!\n\nThis would be a \"one-star\" without James Franco. Once he is introduced you are captivated by his transformation into a wannabe gangsta rapper, especially given his tame, Disney-esque acting in \"Oz, the Great and Powerful.\"\n\nBut then the tedious redundancy corrupted even his performance. The cinematography is interesting but with little plot and the unrelenting repetitiveness, even that became another irritant.

        "review_detailed_main": ".....and that is kicking us right in the nuts, from the first moment on, until the credits have rolled out...and long after.\n\nOnly, this time this isn't a good thing.\n\nFrom the writer of the critically acclaimed \"Kids\" and the director of \"Gummo\", you just know, that it's going to be brutal, it's going to be sadistic, and most shockingly-it's always going to be real-just as the emotional overload Chloe Sevigny was going through in \"Kids\".\n\nBut here-unlike his previous works-it's all to blurry and sugary and colorful, and thus Korine is unable to send us the right message about nowadays teenagers and the sheer downfall some of them are experiencing, while nobody's keeping an eye on them.And just like Franco's character Oz....ooops, i mean Alien(after all he's kinda used to the situation, where he has 3 or more (w)itches at his disposal)the movie is nothing, but an alienating attempt at hitting the right social strings and giving the American audience the punches it needs, in order to change the dystopian societies youth creates for itself.Sadly, it all looks so stylish and so outlandish in the same time, that at the end one feels like he has witnessed a low-budget sci-fi movie set in the near future after a war or a plague of some sort-that's how otherworldly it feels at times.\n\nAnd that's the script to blame-Korine has done a terrible job at portraying a world, for which one needs more than just inside information to portray-it all feels overloaded with color, rap, chicks, but most importantly-this world lacks the severity and the raw, serious nature of the typical world of a \"Lord of War\"-something that both Franco and his friend- turned-nemesis aren't.The cold-blooded nature of a person, who's willing to do everything and anything to stay alive just isn't present.\n\nYou would say that it wasn't an attempt at a crime movie, yet all of the components are here.So, the assumption that one could make after seeing this mess is that's it's actually pretty genre-less.And that, for me, is the worst place a movie can go.\n\nNow, on a lighter note-movie, that has teen-queens Vanessa Hudgens and Selena Gomez (albeit marketing's done a good job to cover the fact Gomez is absent for a big chunk of the movie), should be fun, right?Right?\n\nWrong.First of all-the likes of Disney Channel princess Selena Gomez don't have a place in such a movie-either you go all the way, showing you are no longer a 10-year old's wet teen-dream, or go home, because you take the part of a person, who's willing to do a performance of Spartacus-proportions here.I'm not saying i wish to see her naked, i'm saying it is stupid to give the role to a teen, that does not even know what she wants to be associated with-being a good girl on Disney Channel, or a bad girl in adults-oriented movies.In Spring Breakers she does neither.And that's maybe why her character looks so oddly in place-because she really just didn't want to star in this movie, just as her character Faith does not want to be around Franco and his friends, therefore in the center of the events in the movie.And she has no reason to go bad-girl-she definitely has in mind her fans.But, sadly, most of them, don't know what a quality film means yet, so they certainly don't know what a low-budget, B-grade, R-rated movie is, as they fill the PG-13 quote(let's face it-Gomez's fans are essentially low-teen teens), in the best case-scenario.So, Gomez can't get her people to the theater, her cast is totally unneeded.And i probably won't end up talking so much about her in my life...again...\n\nThe more interesting subject here is Vanessa Hudgens-she is the right Disney Channel-cast and she's definitely up for a transition to adults-oriented cinema, as she showed with films such as Sucker Punch or Beastly.I actually think she has some potential to rise above her teen-star-wet-dream-status and no 13-year old would like her in the role of the twisted devil she plays in this movie, which is-in my opinion-a good thing.It's time for her to do the leap, and so far she has been bold enough doing it.\n\nNow, back to Alien for a moment.I don't want to discuss Franco's performance any further, 'cause i find words even harder.As a Francophile, i'll just say that in any other day, i would crucified him, but in such a blunt, blank, train wreck of a movie, he would be the only memorable thing in mind after a few hours have passed...he and the 175 pairs of boobs of all kinds and shapes we get to see, mixed with the music Korine thinks young people listen to...well, do we not?\n\nSo, a couple of nice and stylishly-shot scenes and interesting soundscape don't make for an otherwise surprisingly dull and empty- shelled movie you'll have a hard time remembering in a few days.Voiced over, designed to be repulsive and thought-provoking with a certain social element to rise awareness of the problems of the youth system as a whole, this attempt at a movie feels empty on the subject and just falls short.\n\nMy grade:5/10"

It's a journey that will become unforgettable for all the wrong reasons. Once they meet drug dealer Alien (played superbly by James Franco) nothing will ever be the same. Fueled by a bumping soundtrack and a great ensemble cast this is a trip you'll want to take. The film feels like it's told from ones perspective of a vacation gone wrong and the flash forwards placed throughout makes this a haunting film that will stay with you once over. Spring break, spring break, spring break forever !!"

        "review_detailed_main": "(Plot) Four college girls who are fed up with the pressures of life head out for a Spring Break Vacation. They turn to drugs & crime, and they all have a stint in jail. Things soon spiral out of control when they meet a drug dealer (James Franco) who bails them out of their predicament in jail.\n\nSelena Gomez & Vanessa Hudgens are very cute for their age. They have embraced their young followers by staying out of trouble for the most part. Hudgens only blemish, according to a lot is that she smokes cigarettes (Who cares! It's an unhealthy habit, but you could do a hell of a lot worse) whilst Gomez has a squeaky clean reputation. I don't know a lot about Ashley Benson or Rachel Koirne, but the point is that this was a huge risk for the girls and they nailed it. A lot of this movie is quite unpleasant to witness and appropriately gritty in nature. I was heavily gripped throughout the first half watching these girls use drugs and party uncontrollably. It was riveting to watch, but what I say next might not be too agreeable to some people. I thought the movie started to get a bit dull in the second half, and that's when James Franco entered the picture. People seem to love his performance, but I'm not one of them. I felt his character was a bit redundant and thoroughly annoying. It became too convoluted and the film started to lose me, when it had me by the balls for most of the first half.\n\n* SPOILERS* If you don't want to be spoiled, don't read any further!\n\nI also was a bit disappointed when Selena Gomez disappeared in the second half. I was emotionally invested in her conflicted character. She was much different than the other girls. It also felt to me like they didn't wanna go all the way with it. It does have many disturbing moments, but I got the feeling that they got cold feet a little bit in the second half. Maybe Selena was hesitant to submerge herself fully into the role to the point of no return, but I ended up being cold and rather indifferent when the movie ended. I got the message. I understood what they were trying to do, but it just felt a bit contrived to me. After such a strong first half, it disappointed me a bit. What about the repercussions for a couple of the girls? They committed murder\u0085 It ended abruptly in my opinion. But overall, I have to give this movie a lot of credit\n\nFinal Thoughts: It made me think for the most part, despite quite a few issues in the second half. For the girls to take on a project like this, I can't help but commend them. Well done, girls! Well done.\n\n6.5/10"

In my opinion there is nothing better than a strong plot that not only immediately grabs your attention, but also a dialog that is direct and to the point when telling the story. As for the leading actresses of the movie I would say they all captivated the screen and really made you believe who they said they were in their roles. Vanessa Hugens out of the four really stood out for me as well as Ashley Benson. The two of them really gave a sensational performance and they really draw you in. James Franco is a description of the word Talented and he just really demands your attention! Selena Gomez is a real actress she never fails to bring a performance that leaves you breathless. The only thing is that despite the controversy of the movie and the raw footage. I don't agree with the popular opinion that this is her breakout role from her Disney image. Her character isn't squeaky clean but she looks like the Disney star riding her bike with her training wheels still on compared to the other girls. The other girls in the movie just really went for it and didn't hold back. Selena still plays it a little safe with her new movie role and uses the movie to put her on another level instead of her actually playing a character that gives her the edge. I rate the movie 7 because in general I enjoyed it and anyone who is interested in seeing it should know its definitely worth watching!"

If you enjoy watching a movie that is 95% montages that are out of sequence with people whispering the same telephone conversation over and over again then this is the film for you.\n\nSure we laughed. But Harmony Korine we were laughing at you. Maybe Korine intended this film to be a mockery of the Spring Break experience, and wanted us to laugh. However, the audience was so confused as to whether or not it was a satire or she was actually intending for it to be a thought provoking drama. Either way she failed because the only part that was slightly provoking was the pool sex scene and the multitude of college boobs zoomed in on the camera.\n\nTo the top rated reviewer and your advice to see the movie in order to know the dangers of Spring Break: We know the dangers, thats why we go. However the newspapers tell a much more compelling story of the horror that can ensue from a week of binging and dancing half naked on a beach. Every year kids die. They overdose, they fall off of balconies, they drink and drive, and they drown. Im pretty sure any kid that gets accepted to college can see the red flag when a character like James Franco's invites you into his Camero, but a film that tells the truth of spring break and the real life consequences of a manic week at the beach would have been much more effective, and endurable."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is my first review after being an avid IMDb user for several years...and that is because I have a strange need to defend this film against criticism I'm sure it's susceptible to.\n\nFirst, I think it makes the most sense to tell you the type of TV/film I tend to enjoy. I am a 25-year-old female that will very readily admit that I enjoy entertainment directed at younger audiences. I have never missed an episode of Pretty Little Liars, I will buy any magazine with Selena Gomez on the cover (and have all of her CDs downloaded), and I absolutely have looked up those leaked pictures of Vanessa Hudgens online once or twice. Before you start to question my taste...no, this isn't the type of stuff I tend to *identify* with, but yes, I am plugged in to the youthful side of pop culture.\n\nThe type of movies I'm usually attracted to are always indie films. I like things that leave me feeling like I learned something \"bigger\" about life. I like to feel like I'm unraveling tiny bits of a person's character in every 90-minute-journey and I like to take what I've discovered and apply it to things I encounter every day. I have seen a couple of Harmony Korine's other films in the past and can say with confidence that his style is something I appreciate.\n\nSo this collision of teen pop culture and indie comedy was basically a wet dream to me. I have been anxiously awaiting the release since it was announced and I even got several friends on board, creating a whole evening around going to Opening Night at the only theater showing it in Milwaukee last night.\n\nThe verdict? I absolutely loved this film. Though the beginning left you wondering if the writer/director really had a good insight into what college girls say and do when males aren't around (I don't think I've ever randomly done handstands in the middle of my dorm hallway in my underwear at 8 am...or exclaimed \"---- makes my pussy wet!\" to a group of girlfriends...), he quickly redeems himself once the girls actually make it to St. Petersburg. The dynamics between the female leads seemed a perfect mix of realism and campiness that helped to advance the plot over the next 30-45 minutes in a somewhat predictable ,but still exciting to watch, type of way.\n\nFaith (Selena Gomez) is probably the most relatable character to any \"normal\" girl this age. She's a Christian, she's not a complete degenerate...but she's also not a saint. She smokes cigarettes, takes hits out of bongs, does lines of coke off of tables, and drinks liquor from paper bags with the rest of them...all the while calling home to tell Grandma how everything is fine. But she still struggles with some of the wild things the other girls are okay with doing, and it makes her seem real. There is a scene sequence when Alien (James Franco) takes the girls to the pool hall filled with \"people from the hood\" and it was one of my favorite parts of the whole movie because of Selena's convincing performance. I think most girls that age could probably relate to a situation where they had set out in search of fun and freedom and what they ended up with was not what they bargained for. I also think most girls could relate to the uncomfortable feeling of being around a bunch of men that you know are viewing you as a piece of meat, and dreading what will happen if you don't find a way to escape. Her pleas to go home and her direct yet nervous conversation with Alien were spot-on and made me feel for her and genuinely hope she made it out.\n\nAshley Benson and Vanessa Hudgens also impressed with their ability to truly act like that pair of best friends that seem just a little bit closer and a little bit crazier than all the other girls you know. Of course, they take it to a whole new level, but I was glad to see them in more adult roles as well.\n\nThe only part of this movie that prevented me from giving it a 9 or 10 was the repetitiveness. Several times throughout the movie, there would be a piece of dialogue said, and then that piece of dialogue would get repeated over and over for the next few minutes as a montage of plot-advancing scenes played through it. I understand that it was being done for effect, and I could handle it in small doses...but there were a couple of parts where it was less effect, and more broken record.\n\nAll in all, I was not disappointed. I would warn that if you are expecting to just see a grown up version of the characters you are used to these girls playing, you are going to be disappointed. If you don't like indie movies and can't grasp dark comedy, you also probably will not like this movie. But if you are interested in seeing some rising stars in controversial roles, with a strong plot and a great sense of humor...then you can't lose on sprannnnng breaaaaaak."

        "review_detailed_main": "Review by Matt:\n\nEvery once in a while, a film comes around that changes your life. A film that you'll tell your kids and grand-kids that ushered in a new wave of cinema. A film that will be a landmark moment where all film- goers collectively get out of their seats, and initiate \"the slow clap.\" A film that that will be broken down in film schools across the world and film historians will bring up in conversations with the likes of \"American Beauty\", \"Casablanca\", and \"8 1/2.\" Well, this isn't this film, not even close, but despite what a lot of people have said, and are saying, \"Spring Breakers\" might not be pretty, but it just might be the biggest guilty pleasure film in recent memory.\n\n\"Breakers\" can be lumped into two categories; it's either a soft-core porn that is cashing in on the popularity of \"Disney girls\" who are trying to break free of their kiddie-image, but they are being exploited just as bad, if not worse. Or, you can look at it as a caricature of Spring Break culture that you might have seen on MTV back in the early 1990s, and an expose on small town life versus \"the real world.\" I promise, I will not dig that deep into this movie, because if you go into \"Breakers\" looking for deep meaning or a reason why the movie was made you are going to miss out on a film that is super fun, super awesome, and super stupid, but stupid in that way that you might have said back in the 1990s, ie, STUPID FRESH!\n\nIn case you heard, the plot is simple. Four friends, Candy, Cotty, Brit, and Faith, don't have enough money to go to Spring Break in Tampa/St. Pete, Florida so they do what any rational young college student would do; rob a restaurant to finance their trip. After their successful robbery, the four girls head to Spring Break for the time of their lives, that is until they're arrested and the party is over, or is it? Bailed out of jail by a small-time gangster named Alien, played by James Franco in probably his most memorable role to date, things go from bad to worse for the four friends as they leave behind their dreams of the best Spring Break ever, and it turns into a nightmare.....or does it?\n\nPart of the fun of \"Breakers\" is not knowing fully what the film is about. Yes, at heart, it's a skin flick that shows PLENTY of boobs, close up shots of crotchal areas, and any parent's nightmare of what their precious little boys and girls are doing in vacation resorts around the country from late March to April. Yes parents, your kids are probably having unprotected sex all over the place, while doing funnels of Natty Light, after doing coke off a townie's a*s. C'mon, we've all been there before.\n\nA few things surprised me about \"Breakers\" besides the fact that I truly enjoyed it, almost too much in fact. Say what you will about Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens; but they can act. Yes, I said it, they can act. I was almost surprised at how down and dirty they got, especially Hudgens, who gives the 2nd best performance in the film, but that best performance goes to Franco, who creates a character that is part Tony Montana, part Saul from \"Pineapple Express,\" and part rapper Paul Wall. His creation of Alien is in fact other worldly, and his \"Look at my sh*t!\" and for lack of a better term, gun blow-job scene, are the highlights of the film. And like my co-reviewer said in his \"OZ\" review, Franco loves to mug for the camera, and he's at his best in \"Breakers\" completely self-aware that he is in complete control of character. Oh, by the way, for you wresting fans, your old pal Double J, Jeff Jarrett, makes a cameo as a Jesus freak. Yes, that Jeff Jarrett.\n\nThis film is polarizing, and people are either going to love it or hate it, just like most of Harmony Korine's films. Let me put it this way, if you've seen \"Kids\" and \"Gummo\" and you hated them, save yourself the money or just be lame and watch \"The Croods\" or \"Tyler Perry's: Temptation.\"\n\n\"Spring Breakers\".......\"Spring Breakers\" forever.........\n\nCheck out more reviews at Simplisticreviews.blogspot.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "Spring Breakers is, you not-so-wrongly believe, one of those movies you cannot help but find out about from viral marketing, targeting the mainstream teenage population of the world with the use of renowned, young teenage-idols who are willing to do just about anything to be regarded as adult stars.\n\nAnd truthfully that's what the original intention was.\n\nThe end result though is a thought provoking film displaying the damage that the pop culture has done to teenagers' perspective of ideal lifestyle in the \"carpe diem\" sense. The director with his overuse of repetitive play of scenes and quotes, a sense of melancholy mixed in even the most happy of sequences along with a soundtrack not suited in a brainlessly entertaining movie, manages to, unintentionally, create a surreal social drama. The excessive display of drugs, sex and violence renders obvious that you shouldn't sympathize with the stars' doings, but instead judge them. It's more of a, what you see in movies only happens in movies, type of message. A reality check for the 2000's MTV, Disney generation of kids turning to wild, abusive, you-only-live-once teenagers.\n\nAn unexpectedly interesting watch."

The director and editors looped the SAME cheesy dialogue thinking that the audience would find its messages profound or act as a foreshadow - but that fails too because it was so poorly executed.\n\nThe final straw was when James Franco was at the piano, his hands weren't even on the keys (or even plausibly moving) while supposed playing and singing! This is such a small point but no matter how bad the movie is, it is 100x worse when the production team and director ARE LAZY. It's extremely insulting to the audience.\n\nThe very unrealistic plot line has been addressed but the script must have been only 2 pages long due to the lack of dialogue and unnecessarily dragged out scenes. The whole movie could have been condensed into 30 minutes with more impact."

It was weird to see one of his films as a mainstream hit earlier this year, and it seems like some people legitimately liked Spring Breakers. It's exploitation, plain and simple. Dumb as Hell, basically just a modern day version of Reefer Madness. But if you look at it through the exploitation lens, it is a bit amusing. Four basically interchangeable girls in neon bikinis rob a restaurant to afford their spring break trip to Florida. There they get in even more trouble, especially when they meet up with rapper/criminal James Franco. Franco's the most amusing thing about it, chewing that scenery like crazy with his shiny grill. The music (by Cliff Martinez and Skrillex, along with plenty of rappers on the soundtrack) is awesome, I loved the neon look (though it's not as cool as the similar look of Only God Forgives), and the weird editing patterns are pretty cool. The girls are the weak spot. I didn't really look at their faces too often. The \"nice\" one of the four leads is played by teen pop star Selena Gomez. I know the name Vanessa Hudgens, but I doubt I could pick her out of a crowd (I remember several years ago, during a trivia tournament, I mistook Selena Gomez for Hudgens). For whatever it's worth, the film is at least more amusing than Sofia Coppola's turgid The Bling Ring."

This movie is like the worst movie i've ever watched my entire life. it is not even a comedy or drama like IMDb says. It is a 90 minute of absolute crap, some stupid dub-step music playing, tits, butts, some guys jerking off so if you wanna enlist this under porn movies genre go ahead, but it's gonna terribly suck on that too.\n\nNow let's cut the swearing and get to the storytelling (no worries, there are no spoilers up ahead) our director here did his best to spoil every moment of the movie for you with that stupid, unnecessary flashbacks and fast-forwarding every now and then. He even spoiled the ending for me at almost half of the movie. The writing is completely terrible, you can watch Selena Gomez calling her Grandma 3 times on the movie saying the same exact words!!! with a few words changing every time. Seriously?! are you out of words to repeat every damn sentence over and over? So what's left I've not talked about? Aha! the acting. Well, guess what? even a dumb-ass dog could show some face expressions better than those three girls staring at each other the whole movie, thinking that's the right thing for being shocked? No. actually this is the right thing for being Dead!\n\nConclusion: If you wanna waste a 90 minutes of your life that you'll never get back. watch this bullshit. but if I were you. I would bring up some threads. twisting and Un-twisting them for a 90 minutes. That would be way more useful. Trust me!"

        "review_detailed_main": "It's so much fun to watch a movie that seems realistic and the shots seem to have an intention. I think the reviews might be a bit gender biased, but not in the way you think. From the girls randomly stroking each others hair as a sign of affection, to the nervous laugh they have around men, to the fake forced sounds that they have to make , the elongated zoom on the man touching his lips when looking, the cameras pretatory gaze and how it starts from a shaking ass from a party to the girl randomly being filmed while unconcious. It starts to not feel comedic anymore but thats how the girls feel too. The movie is disturbing to watch but also feels like a drunk night out at the same time.\n\nThe movie is satire, but, It did not romanticize a very real \"party\" lifestyle if you're middle class or under. It is those places and \"trashy\" parties, that you usually find the drug problems, that even the girls developed during the film. I've been to that beach party, where the artist sings off tune and people yell. Most girls have propably met these men and i kept so much tension in my body when looking at the rooms filled with predatory stares."

NO! Dragging on and on with interlaced music, stylized scenery and beautiful women does not make a movie. Just bad, period.

Here is another explanation: the director was in a YOLO state of mind himself - he was up for some meaningless fun in the Florida sun. He then just threw some \"artistic\" pretense over the resulting turd of a movie before pooping it out, not caring whether the audience would still be stupid enough to gobble it up anyway or flush it down in disgust.\n\nTo be fair there was one scene I could identify with: Selena Gomez crying and saying she wants to go home.

        "review_detailed_main": "Summary: Spring Breakers is a strange flick about promiscuous teenagers, drug dealers, guns and sex. 60/100 (C+)\n\nDirected by Harmony Korine, Spring Breakers tells the story of four attractive students planning to raise money for the spring break trip stealing a fast food stand. But that's just the beginning. During a party night the girls are arrested with drug charges. Hungover and dressed just with their bikinis, they see a judge, but they are unexpectedly liberated by Alien (James Franco), a rare local thug which takes the girls to his home and they have the craziest spring vacations of their lives. All the girls are very happy with him, except one girl called \"Faith\" (Selena Gomez) she does not trust in Alien at all.\n\nThis movie wasn't as good as I thought. The first half was quite enjoyable and crazy, but the second half is darker, slow and violent. Also, the last 30 minutes of the movie were very awkward to watch. Moving on, all the choices and decisions of the characters in Spring Breakers felt genuine, but there was not enough plot in the film; it was boring and uninteresting to me. You don't care about the characters, because most of them are stupid and annoying. I also want to add that since the departure of Gomez in the second half of the movie, the film became in a disgusting pornographic mess, filled with bizarre sex scenes and repetitive dialog.\n\nOn the upside, the whole cast did a great job. James Franco's performance was astonishing, he nailed it. However, Spring Breakers is basically 94 minutes of strange pornography to me. Yes, I enjoyed some moments of this pornographic mess, the first act is somewhat enjoyable and funny at times, but most of the movie is just uncomfortable. Maybe you will enjoy it more, I don't know. If you like movies about drugs, teenagers acting like prostitutes, guns and sex, Spring Breakers is your best choice. If you expect an entertaining film about some likable girls in their vacations, you'll be disappointed. This is just a strange crime flick.\n\nIt has a well-known cast. Vanessa Hudgens was good, but her character was unlikable and dull. Seriously, watching the film I was like... who cares about this whore? Nobody! Also, she just said two lines in the whole movie. Good job, screenwriter! Another one is Ashley Benson, she's beautiful, what else can I say? Well... at least her role was a little bit more interesting. Another girl is performed by Rachel Korine. I think that Rachel is way too old for her character, and she was actually the only one who showed her breasts. Finally, the most decent character and the most engaging performance was Faith (Selena Gomez), she was smart and believable.\n\nIt's a slow film that boasts an original plot, a talented cast and a bunch of crazy moments. My favorite moment in the movie was a scene between Selena Gomez and James Franco, their performances were excellent. The message of the film is also very thought-provoking and sincere. It shows how some teens just want to have fun, no matter what. In conclusion, most of Spring Breakers is odd and boring, but I still recommend it if you like movies about parties, guns, sex and drug dealers. Do not see it if you expect lots of entertainment or friendly characters. It is just a movie about promiscuous teenagers. The ending was quite good though. (C+)"

A viable balance of the struggle between bad-girl vs. Christian girl is played out beautifully by gorgeous newcomer Selena Gomez, who as it turns out, truly knows how to act.\n\nThe reason for only 9 stars is the futile attempts of Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Benson to portray small town criminals. It's easy to look past that once they are fully dressed in micro bikinis for the final 75 minutes of the movie."

It's mostly chronological, but the way it skips around within the moments it is portraying makes the whole movie feel dreamlike. Whenever music kicks in, it feels more like you are watching a music video, or the trailer for a movie. This fluid way of presenting the story works quite well.\n\nIt's also interesting how they chose the \"spring break\" setting, combined with the music video like editing. It makes the film look like something completely different than what it is, and I like that it breaks with expectations.\n\nBesides that, I don't have much positive to say about the movie. It seems like it's mostly made to be a visual experience, because both story are characters are not prioritized. The characters are hard to believe in, and the story itself matches the music video comparisons made before. Contrasting the naive and innocent, with the thrill seeking and outright horrible, is not enough to make it interesting on a story level. Putting two contrasts together is easy, but it's harder to make a tension between them that serves some other purpose than being unfamiliar or unexpected.\n\nIf you can easily lose yourself into visuals, mood and sound, I'm sure this can be quite a film to experience. If you don't like that too much, then this movie has little new to offer other than some technical finesses."

Something that might and could also be said about some of the lead actresses who are not really known for more than being Teenagers (or were known that is).\n\nSelena Gomez seems not to be able to cross that line though and while she seems to be a really sweet and good person to talk (having only seen interviews with her), she still has to mature as an actress. Vanessa Hodgens seems to be stealing the show, coupled with a great performance by another actress that I almost mistakenly identified as Amy Smart. But the girls almost get out-shined by James Franco! At one point during the movie it seems like he's taking reigns of the movie ... but worry not, it gets back on its track and if you let yourself, you'll enjoy the ride too"

But it's not that at all, not even a light comedy. When I gave the movie a chance, I already knew the cover had little to do with the content, but never thought it would be this different. To see this film you must first forget it's Vanessa Hudgens or Selena Gomez on screen. I'm European, and so many scenes seemed gratuitous at first, and dumb as many American school movies, but when I got the tone it, they started to make sense. The only thing I knew about Selena Gomez was she starred in Disney and was girlfriend of Bieber, and pictures of both always reminded me of how much the World we live in, is artificial. Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised by her, she had a good presence and showed great acting skills. Franco was believable as a gangster, Hudgens really seemed a crazy slut, and the rest of the cast where OK too. The movie isn't perfect, but it's well filmed, has some strong points, so in my opinion, it's well worth watching. If you liked \"Kids\", you'll probably like this one too"

The only reason for this was because I knew exactly what I was in for. A lot of people thought it was going to be a deep, meaningful movie with a complex plot that comments on today's society. These people were wrong! Spring breakers is a true black and white film that shows what can happen on spring break. It was very visually interesting and the violence and sexuality was extremely prominent, but what else can you expect from a spring break movie. There will obviously be sex and drugs. The acting was decent and the plot was not the greatest, but it was still a great movie. Anybody who saw this movie for the cast or to discover the hidden meanings behind it were disappointed because that's not what this movie was made for. Yes this movie has some big names, but if that's all you saw this movie for or all you will see this movie for you will hate it! You have to know what to expect when seeing a movie and you can't always expect perfection (you can't expect Lord of the Rings from a movie like Napoleon Dynamite!) Spring Breakers was not perfect, but it was a damn good movie! So just keep in mind that this isn't for everyone and keep an open mind while watching it and you'll probably like it too."

Whether it was my lowered expectations that caused me to like this movie, or the fact that it was actually a good movie, is something I can not say; however, one thing that I know for certain is that Spring Breakers is a very artistic movie. The filming is very creative and in the moments the movie lacked a little bit in activity, I found myself appreciating the art in the filming. I found every scene to be filled with interesting setting and lighting, which I truly enjoyed. I find it is a movie that you either will love, or you won't, but if you are an artistic person, and like to see things from a different perspective than others, you should definitely watch this movie. I enjoyed it, despite the nudity and violent scenes."

The story is completely unbelievable, and to make it even worse completely uninteresting. The fact that Kids and Trainspotting come up as similar movies is just utterly irresponsible and incorrect. Those movies would be polar opposites of this.\n\nThe acting may be great depending on if the four girls are actually human beings with an IQ above 40. I personally believe they are not and this was not in fact acting but these terrible people just being themselves.\n\nAt best this is a \"crime\" movie for tweens or people that generally don't understand what crimes are or any clue on how to execute them. I didn't have the highest expectations going in, but from some of the good reviews I was at least expecting a half baked attempt at some grittiness.\n\nIn conclusion, if you are thinking of watching this I would instead recommend softcore porn for the superior writing and soundtrack."

Well the movie contains lots of spoilers and profanity words but without this the movie was incomplete. At the end you will be completely thrilled. But i think that the movie should have been 15 to 20 minutes longer. The story was folded up very early and no re appearing of Selena saddened me. She should have had some more role and movie didn't have so much of twist so the twists and thrills are also lacking but overall this movie is great a must go for 15+ teens and young adults.

        "review_detailed_main": "***SPOILERS****\n\nI saw previews after believing it would be some tacky chick flick and though hey this actually may be a bit edgy and maybe pretty good so gave it a watch..I remain on the fence.\n\nI am still unsure as to whether the girls are supposed to just be such deluded kids going on about how magical it all is and how they fit in blah blah blah is meant to reflect how vapid, shallow and clueless and easily led some kids can be now. How we live in a world where people want wealthy music video-esque lives,kids imitate violence,gang culture and sexuality shown on TV and video games without thought- or whether the director was trying to make the audience believe that it was magical and special too and therefore ultimately get their point. I really hope it was not the latter..\n\nThe movie is pretty well shot and although not a skrillex fan the music worked very well, (apart from the rendition of Britney spears by a \"gangster\" on a white piano- played over slow motion graphic violence and girls dancing with guns,which I believe was supposed to have serious credibility and pose some level of depth,dear god.) But overall, if it is meant to be taken seriously and not as some ironic, farcical teenage fantasy this movie fails at every turn.\n\nThe whole concept fell flat for me,the girls robbing a restaurant seems plausible when you see the actual execution but they wouldn't get caught after handling guns & grabbing till cash with no gloves? burning a car? sure.\n\nThen the \"good\" girl, (why did she even go?) gets all freaked after they get arrested in Florida and meet \"Alien\" the gangster and goes home crying on a bus. ( I had to laugh after remembering Selena saying she loved playing an edgy film role, sure you played the good kid who freaked..)\n\nAlien is ridiculous. Some slimy, perverse and overtly stereotyped gangster trying to show depth while being like \"look at all my s***\" constantly.doesn't work. He comes across as a creep. So stone cold gangster, self confessed dangerous man- hanging with silly little teenagers who are so tough, till one gets shot in the arm, whales like a baby for 10 minutes and- yep, goes home crying on a bus as her increasingly off the rails friends remain with Alien.\n\nWhat really got me was the ending. There was a spat between Alien and some other dude over who runs the area. We know there is bad blood but it escalates pretty fast after pink hair girl gets shot. Suddenly the two teenage girls are somehow ultra calm super killers- they manage to hold powerful guns in the air, one handed - AND take out like ten gangsters at once in cold blood, while super ultra dangerous killer man Alien,is taken out by one guy after 3 seconds. They then kill the opposing guy in his hot tub while he makes no attempt to do anything but shrug.There is then the whole let's call out parents to tell them what a magical time we are having and how we will be home soon, after committing mass murder and stealing a car.\n\nThe only thing that makes the whole scene even barely feasible is the fact that in the beginning of the movie before casing a cafe they made references to pretending they were \"In a video game\" while seriously hyped on cocaine. The lines between reality seem to have been seriously blurred for these girls, who have gone from being bratty,squeaky girly teens with an bit too much attitude dancing around singing and drinking to stone cold, hardcore killers (in pink unicorn balaclavas and bikinis)less afraid than a gangster and able to shoot guns like pros in seemingly zero time frame.\n\nAnd lastly, the massively grating over use of the term \"Spring Break\" often followed as gratingly by the words \"forever\" and \"bitches\" wow. yes we get it,they are on spring break.And are trying to be such badass bitches,like, you know,forever.Okay now that's established- are we done yet? Or maybe that's the point.\n\nyou can take two views on this movie:\n\n1. It is actually deep and satirical showing the flaws and over ideas of kids and adults who go to any lengths to replicate the media ideas they see to the point where they are living false and dangerous lives like many people of fame. People who cannot live up to the hype of their self created persona in the end.\n\n2. It is supposed to be some drug hyped violence fest for horny guys and teenage girls with too much attitude who love the idea of being crazy harlets in the sun fueled by booze coke but then it goes too far so they become serious robbers & killers for the kicks while still believing what they are doing is magic & special."

But you're gonna kinda be disappointed with what comes after. The movie evolves from a brainless flick about girls going on spring break to bringing out a message about the sickness of youth's society.\n\nThe amount of bad ratings surprises me, especially the reviews saying that this film has no depth or plot. It definitely says something about the struggling youth in school and how desperate they are, their na\u00efvet\u00e9, and the sick b@stards who are running the slums and picking off girls.\n\nI thought the screenplay was great. The repetition of scenes and dialogue really drives in the themes of the film in. \"Spring Break Forever\" because none of them want it to end.\n\nThe acting from the girls was pretty mediocre, though I thought Selena Gomez's depiction of the reluctant good girl was alright. But James Franco performed amazingly. He was so creepy and dirty and self obsessed in a way you'd expect his character to be, but he let some humanity show through which made him more real and just nasty.\n\nI thought this was a good movie and it doesn't deserve the hate it is receiving. It's much more enjoyable without your hand down your pants!"

When it was finished, I regretted not leaving 20 minutes into the movie like another group of people did. I think I can safely say that no one enjoyed it, because when the movie ended, everyone in the room was silent...there was none of the usual chatter going on when a movie ends.\n\nI deeply regret having spent my money and time on this movie, and would not watch it again if they paid me!"

That's not to say it didn't hold an interesting narrative at times, or that it lacked substance.\n\nIt seems to poke fun at the fakeness and inauthenticity that traveling can bring in terms of \"finding yourself\" as a person, when really you're just a young person who wants to drink, smoke and f*ck. Unfortunately, it felt just a little bit too fake in itself.\n\nI think it struggles a bit with tone. At moments it rivals a legitimate coming of age story, however at other moments it seems almost more in the style of a Dicaprio Romeo and Juliet styled crime story where drug dealers and little girls become assassins with dead shot aim, seemingly overnight. Meanwhile the thuggin black dudes who no doubt have thugged it up and shot guns for years, have such bad aim they probably couldn't commit suicide successfully with less then a full clip.\n\nA good comparison for me would be to say Spring Breakers is to Kids what Public Enemies is to Heat. An interesting little snippet with potential, but it just doesn't work as well as the originals that defined this director's style. The shoe just didn't quite fit and it smelled a little funky.\n\nOne thing this film accomplishes in strides, like many of the works from this director, is that it makes you feel uncomfortable in many instances. A true artist and a creator, the director's influence is present, though seemingly a little more commercialized. I think there is a meaningful story in here, but it's drowned out by too much partying and a lackluster story."

The situation takes a potentially hazardous turn when a stranger, a gangsta rapper named Alien (James Franco), bails 'em out. Gucci Mane is on hand as Alien's rival.\n\nThis is a combination art film and serious crime/drama, but it also satirizes Spring Break libertinism and ventures into fantasy in the final act. The overall filmmaking is top-of-the-line, including the surprisingly excellent acting of the four anti-heroines. Franco is unrecognizable (to me) as the rapper, obviously modeled after Dangeruss and RiFF RAFF (the latter suing Korine because of it).\n\nThe movie's entertaining as a mesmerizing look at Spring Break hedonism and all that goes with it. Rachel, the director's wife, is particularly fetching. The debauchery is interestingly balanced out by some spiritual references, particularly one of the girl's Christian fellowship. However, the second half switches gears once Alien is introduced. I liked the message concerning the anchor of faith, hope & love making a person sensitive to impending peril, granting the wisdom to abscond.\n\nWhat lowers my rating are some eye-rolling vulgarities (e.g. the gun fellatio scene) and, especially, that I couldn't buy the two main girls as intimidating lethal hoodlums, whether at the beginning with squirt guns or later. The ending in particular was thoroughly unconvincing, IF we're to take it as reality.\n\nThe picture runs 94 minutes and was shot in St. Petersburg/Tampa/Sarasota, Florida. Be forewarned: This is a hard 'R' movie with loads of profanities, vulgarities and nudity but, like I said, surprisingly balanced out by pious elements.\n\nGRADE: B-"

        "review_detailed_main": "First off, I'm glad I read that the writer of Kids directed this movie so I had a bit of an idea of what to expect style wise and that was my biggest problem with the movie. Its like watching a dream, which some may like, but it was a little too trippy for me. The reason why I gave the movie a 6 is mostly for James Franco, who was great in the brief moments he had dialogue and even the parts he doesn't. And as far as dialogue goes, there's not much of it. I will say the director does achieve with telling its story for the most part, its just the way he does it that's irritating. Its definitely got that \"arthouse\" feel to it, and with a movie about girls in bikinis, guns and drugs it doesn't seem to fit. I was reminded of the movie Traffic and how Steven Soderbergh directed it in a kind of abstract style. But the key with that film is that he allowed for a lot of character development. In Spring Breakers, Franco really seemed to be the only character with any kind of development. The girls are given a little back story, but not enough for me to really care about them. The story is really good, which the director also wrote, I just think a better director could have made a much better film of this if they got their hands on it. I know Korine didn't want to make the typical Hollywood movie and he succeeded, but there's a lot of great directors out there who don't do the typical Hollywood films that he could have handed the reigns to. Probably the oddest thing about the movie is that both IMDb and Wikipedia say this is a comedy and drama. This is the farthest thing from a comedy. Franco is funny in some moments but this is a pretty heavy drama. I think some people may look at the cast and see comedy and think this is a fun spring break movie. Trust me, its not. The only other positive thing I can say is about the soundtrack, which was quite good, aside from the Britney Spears songs. Skrillex does the score and I hope they do more movie work in the future.\n\nAnd on another note, for any wrestling fans out there, Jeff Jarrett has a brief role in the beginning as a youth pastor, that cracked me up."

This is the case with most, if not all, of Harmony Korine's films. He's not making films to please audiences, he's offering an experience and making statements in profound ways. Spring Breakers is a dreamlike film with a loose narrative. It exists in a slightly warped reality. You cannot expect this movie to play like an episode of Law & Order. It is a visual and aural poem to be taken in like a painting. That said, the film is still very relevant to attitudes expressed and held in today's youth culture. How many times have you heard \"YOLO\" in the past year? This is showing the dark realities of the YOLO culture in dazzling day-glo. All of the sex appeal and glamour, all of the violence and emptiness. In interviews, Harmony Korine keeps referring to Spring Breakers as a \"pop poem.\" I think what he's showing us with this film is every aspect of American pop culture at the same time. Most people are not prepared to be faced with how funny, sad, disturbing, violent, and just plain ridiculous these pop ideals can be when presented in such a confrontational and naked way. If you are able to put aside your expectations and let this film wash over you, you will be rewarded with a powerful experience from a beautifully crafted piece of \"poetry in motion.\""

If you're looking for a spring break film, this ain't it. And yet, it probably won't make you think as much as other A24 films. James Franco is a very odd casting choice, perhaps odd enough to be worth seeing, and I was pleasantly surprised by Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens, who were pretty natural in their roles, though I don't consider them to be \"good\" actors. This film is strange, with a dose of real, and it's worth watching for A24 fans. This film is iconic, but admittedly not my cup of tea."

Automatically you either hate these girls or love them. The characters they portray might be a dramatization of the scary example of girls today, either way they convince you that these bitches aren't your average bitches. Though they are truly tested when they are finally living the life that they've waited so long for, being the unauthoritative themselves they can finally be.\n\nUp-leveled by Franco's performance of portraying the most charismatic creeper of all time, though the dialogue throughout the movie is repetitive and sometimes flat out laughable, strong cinematography help give the illusion that everything can be perfect.\n\nThe movie truly gives you a feel that the future of the younger generation is really in trouble."

I liked the click clack of a gun between each scene in this movie.

This obviously includes sex, drinking, drugs, and scandal-this is the world we live in today. Young girls exploit themselves and call it \"fun\"...\n\nIn my personal opinion, I don't think the movie is supposed to be \"FUN\"... It's whole purpose is to show us that what we believe to be fun in today's society does nothing but harm us whether it be physically, emotionally, or spiritually. You will sit and watch these girls supposedly having the time of their lives and if you understand it you should say to yourself \"This world is seriously effed up.\" I have seen people review this movie and say that it is unrealistic and it lacks creativity. These are fair points but think about this: People go to jail everyday for pretty much everything you see when you watch this movie. It's creativity is not in what you see, it's in what you don't."

A bunch of underage girls walking around in a bikini all week binging drugs, alcohol, doing crime, being rowdy, loud, obnoxious, with guns, and nothing happens to them.\n\nThat's pretty much it for the whole entire movie. Most scenes is just them acting like a toddler or doing more drugs. Then laying around. Then more drinking. Then driving around. Then more drugs. Then talking about how \"this is life\" and how they're tired of everyday life.\n\nHuh? Tired of everyday life? Why are they talking like they're 50 years old that just got a divorce working the same job for 30 years? These are literally kids barely able to drink. They don't know anything.\n\nIn summary this movie is an over-glorification of degeneracy. This is not how Spring Break is or how it should be. It's over-the-top exaggerated. It wants you to believe that this is what everyone is like and what you're supposed to do if you go on Spring Break."

The story gets across but it could've been told more straight forward. Instead we get this long loopy line of a plot that bends in many different ways and it ultimately lost most of my interest. Saying that, I still found it an entertaining watch. The movie is dark, mysterious, and sexual and those themes did their parts well. It was mixed in nicely. There were a few surprise plot twists that made me watch to the end. There is a message in this movie and it gets across but it's as if Piccaso directed this movie because it feels like one confusing art feature.\n\nI was entertained, at times. It wasn't what I expected going in and it may surprise you. Just be prepared to be a bit bored through some of the movie."

        "review_title": "Phantasmagoric teenage angst",
        "review_detailed_main": "After a bout of flying nuns and Michael Jackson impersonators, Harmony Korine returns with his most mainstream production yet. A mesmerising tale of a quartet of cash-strapped teenage students, living in small-town USA, that decide that a Florida escapade during spring break is a necessity to lighten up there dim, repetitive existence. Devoid of the monetary means they decide to hold up a local diner, thus already pushing the limits of their expectations as to this excursion. Somewhat the outlier of this group of friends is Faith (Selena Gomez), a bible-hugging devout Christian, who nonetheless knows the worth of going crazy with the like of Candy (Vanessa Hudgens), Brit (Ashley Benson) and Cotty (Rachel Korine).\n\nWith the ill-gotten gains they venture to student-crazy Florida beaches, where breasts are bouncing, beer is pouring and the foursome aim to spend a moment of eternal perfection in this vapid spurge of debauchery. Faith wishes for time to stop and the sun and fun to become permanent, as the four friends ride the town on their rad scooters. With a backdrop of destructive parties, lack of hindsight and total no-holds-barred partying, the inevitable occurs as the dream collides with a breath of reality. Enter Alien (James Franco) who offers of prolongation of the dream - undying lack of responsibility for your actions. Faith hits her limit and promptly resigns to return to drab existence, but the remaining threesome delve into the gangster lifestyle of robbing spring breakers and pushing dope. Spring break forever, y'all!!!\n\nHarmony Korine borrows his artistic style heavily from fellow auteur Terrence Mallick, delivering a similarly sombre tone of existentialist dramaturgy, where flashbacks, flash-forwards, jump-cuts and images are juxtaposed to off-camera narration by the characters. Nonetheless Korine introduces a cascading chaos to the proceedings, as if attempting to replicate the drunken orgy that are summer Florida excursions in the way he tells it story. The end result is a unmissable sense of resigned acceptance of the inevitable countered by the joyous bliss of expectations, which basically underpins the whole concept of the movie. The movie falls back on spring break as a hopeless attempt to remain young and live the eternal party, dauntlessly striving to avoid the lingering reality to filter through teenage euphoria.\n\nThe artistic premise works well, although people either unaccustomed or repulsed by Mallick's method of storytelling may be taken back by the hypnotic narrative. Nonetheless severe flaws populate the overall movie, as Korine decides to forgo certain structural story-telling necessities or dashes headfirst into logical pitfalls, thus severely weakening the overall impact. At one point, for example, you can't help but wonder how a semi-renowned characteristically looking gangster-rapper like Alien can audaciously hold up people at gunpoint without any police blow-back.\n\nThe biggest issue itself is the presentation of the female leads. Or its lack. Apart from Faith, who is given some background as to her church praying everyday life and some insight into her thought processes (with a key monologue about the mundanity of life), the remaining threesome are an amorphous being, which are hard to differentiate from each other, not only as to their character traits, but also physically. Rachel Korine stands out somewhat with her pink hair, but it took me the better part of 40 minutes to distinguish the actresses between each other and with the closing credits I still had no sense of identity to any of them. This in part brings about the misogynist accusations, which are sometimes hurdled at the movie. With such disposable barely-clad anti-heroines with strong sexual innuendos often present, the overall concept tends to be laid to waste by the utter lack of interest into who exactly these women are."

Pink Unicorn Ski masks, Britney Spears songs, Praying before Spring Break... all them Disney girls, Franco ( who is phenomenal btw ) acting real thug life, Gucci Mane with his ghetto ice cream tattoo, the Atlanta twins who just play themselves.. ( The only thing that sort of annoyed me was Rachel Korine, his wife, who plays one of the girls.

However in this one, I felt his performance was one- note as the goofy, gold-toothed white rapper & drug dealer. Not horrible per se, but just lacking in nuance, which actually might be the fault of the director in the editing room. I've seen Harmony Korine's other movies \"Kids\" and \"Gummo\", so those are his only other two movies I can compare it to- IMO it's on the same level as Kids and WAY better than Gummo, both in story composition, scene construction, and performances by the main actresses. The girls all played their characters well, especially Selena Gomez as the appropriately named Faith who just can't reconcile her morals with her friends' concept of \"fun\". Boobs and butts abound as we go through one wild party scene to another, so if you like seeing jiggling female body parts, you're in for a treat. If not- you might want to find a different movie. 6 out of 10 stars."

In fact you see many young ladies in bikini and several bearing all throughout the picture.\n\nUnderneath this shallow opening is a quirky, moody coming of age fantasy as the film follows four college girls Candy (Vanessa Hudgens) Faith (Selena Gomez) Brit (Ashley Benson) and Cotty (Rachel Korine) on their first spring break in Florida after robbing a restaurant to fund their trip.\n\nOnce they arrive in Florida the girls partake on a hedonistic time of partying, booze, drugs and sex. However when they are arrested they come to the attention of wild guy gangster Alien (James Franco.) Alien is an unlikeable sleazeball and Faith wants to go back home. The others remain even being turned on by being his neon clad gangster babes as he duels with rival gangs.\n\nDirector Harmony Korine said he was inspired by the film version of Miami Vice and he does present many moodily, neon lit scenes accompanied with a gangster soundtrack and Britney Spears.\n\nThe film does lull in the middle, the main female characters seem to be lightly sketched in, even deluded. Only Franco makes an impression as the devilish Alien."

The only thing that stands n their way is the lack of money and so they just...go for it.\n\nThe abundance of pretty young bodies that often fill the screen, highlighting their hedonistic needs forms the backbone for this movie. Life is a party, a joy. Why place limits and kill the fun? Abuse now, face consequences later.\n\nOur three naive youngsters, do not seem to deal well with consequences which is something the bailing gangster knows only too well and the sprng break takes a whole new form.\n\nStylish and sensual, fun and exciting that is ultimately let down by a known Hollywood tendency to move way beyond the realms of possible and real in order to achieve a higher box office taking."

If you have seen any of Korine's earlier films such as Gummo or Kids, this film is a Disney movie compared to those. Speaking of Disney movies, they did a great job with the casting and if these girls wanted out of the Disney light, they sure did it with this movie. Great acting all the way around and Korine's wife even plays a big part i the movie. James Franco does a great job, although Im almost 100% positive Korine ripped off RiFF RAFF for the part of James Franco. This movie is highly underrated and should have gotten higher marks."

        "review_detailed_main": "Every year we get an Independent film that tries to be trendy and tries to be a ground breaking art film that tries to sway the audience to feel what the characters are dealing with throughout the film. This year we have Spring Breakers starring Vanessa Hudgens, James Franco, and Selena Gomez who is trying to breakthrough more adult roles. The film is written and directed by Kids director Harmony Korine. Spring Breakers is about four adolescent girls who are stressed out from college and upset that most of their college friends are having fun during Spring Break while they are bored, they have no money, and no car. The girls are determined to have fun so they rob a restaurant and steal one of their teachers El Camino while telling each other act like it is a video game. The girls reach Florida and what ensues for basically the first fifty minutes of the film are deleted scenes you would find for Girls Gone Wild. Lots of musical montages with drug use, topless girls, and lesbian make out sessions repeated over and over again for the viewer to endure. After fifty minutes, the girls are arrested and then bailed out of jail by a rapper/drug dealer named Alien played by James Franco. The second half of the film is a bunch of teens wanting to be gangster except for Gomez who breaks down, cries and heads home. The girls and Franco take turns performing felicio on the guns before deciding to rob people to gain more money to help pay for their college, end their stress, and end their boredom. What ensues for the last thirty minutes of the film are more musical montages of pointless sex scenes and constant drug use that are embedded in a matrix style shootout. The film is a prime example of when a director and a writer, in this case they are the same person try too hard. The film tries to give a trippy feel but the film is just an incoherent mess that even Rob Zombie would laugh at. As for the acting, there really isn't any. Dialogue is at a minimum throughout the film and do character development what so ever. There are no characters that the audience could relate or even identify with. Before this film I enjoyed most things that the actors and directors have worked on. Spring Breakers is easily one of the worst films in cinema history and is to date one of the worst films I have ever seen. I have seen and own a lot of bad films, some are guilty pleasure but there was no pleasure with this film. This film left me empty after viewing. I give them film a half of star and that is being generous. Avoid at all costs."

The colours are incredible, the sunsets are as intense as the vitality of these young girls.\n\nWho had never dreamed to live a life to its fullest? To disconnect from reality, blandness, monotone colours, and reasonable decisions? I think we've all been trough this. And this movie manages to make you feel like you have a part of these girls within you, despite their naive personnalities.\n\nThe characters love their decisions as much as they fear them. Even the hustler character.\n\nI remember when this movie was released in France in 2012 or 2013, it received tons of very good critiques. I finally got the chance to watch it today on Netflix and now I understand why everyone was saying it's a masterpiece. It is such a shame that it got such a low rating here. Probably because people didn't expect to watch a deep piece of art but were hoping to get enternainted by a comedy?\n\nYou have to watch this movie!"

        "review_detailed_main": "**1/2 out of (****)- FRESH\n\nSporting its T&A as proud as a high school diploma, the scantily-clad beauties venture off to their neon-infused Candyland from Hell in the bombastic \"Spring Breakers\". If one were to just take a glance at the posters or the commercials for this movie, it would garner a lot of groans. Another teen sex romp? It's unfortunate this didn't draw in the movie it should've, because if you scoffed at what you thought Breakers was going to sell you, it did it's job. Because this isn't the movie your expecting. At all.\n\nThe movie opens with a typical Eurotrip-like crowd pleaser. Plethora of boobs, loud party music, visceral beach shots, etc. It's all there. Soon enough, when the scenes are darker (both figuratively and aesthetically), that's when you know you walked into the wrong movie. What I found interesting about Spring Breakers was actually its cinematography. It's like Putting Edge (a neon mini golf facility) splashed onto a movie. If ever your mind drifts from the movie, you still are awe-inspired by the visual aspect of the film.\n\nWhat I liked about Breakers that few movies do right is how you actually feel like your on a ride. Most films try to emulate the experience, but it's stuck in that Hollywood gloss. Fortunately, Harmony Korine's art form drowns his movie out with a euphoric soundtrack, Enter the Void's the hell out of the movie, and gives our characters this odd, dream-like approach. And he takes it a notch further by building this obscene tone and atmosphere.\n\nI also think that this movie is highly controversial. I applied the later party shots, depicting the true brutality of parties like this, the over-the-top level of nudity, the debauchery, etc. There's also a saucy pool threesome tossed in for good measure.\n\nWhat might take you out of Korine's tour-de-force is the lack of story. For a movie with a striking tone, a precise direction, and a lot more going for it, a script is one it lacks. But with such an abstract movie like Breakers, a story isn't going to be your biggest issue.\n\nMy last complaint is how it's not too coherent. It's like Korine wants to enhance this level of madness/insanity you feel watching it by making a very off-the-wall pacing and throwing a lot of rough cuts at you. This leaves you perplexed in places where you really shouldn't feel that way.\n\nBreakers is a mostly hit-and-miss affair, but I enjoyed it greatly. You'd think with a \"6\", I didn't care for it much, but it's a high one. When most films concentrate on a story or its characters, Breakers does something new. It concentrates on the tone/atmosphere and in the end, you're rewarded with a unique experience. It might also be one of the most well shot and interestingly directed films you're likely to see this year. Critics or fans may be divided, but I thought Spring Breakers was a good movie."

It tries to be artistic with it's mixed scenes and sketchy camera angles, but it fails to be a good movie, or even an okay movie. James Franco is the only reason I kept watching until the end. He really got into his character well and looked like he really took his role seriously. Why he chose to do this movie, I don't know. Franco is way too talented to star in a cheesy movie like this one. As for the girls in this movie, smoking hot, but annoying as hell. I was hoping for way more to this film, but I ended up never wanting to hear \"Spring Break Forever\" again. F"

The film makers should have been honest with themselves and shot a straight forward porn. At least then they wouldn't have mislead people and tricked them into thinking they were watching a real movie. At several points I thought it was like film version of Girls Gone Wild but with less dialog and more bad music.\n\nI think this could have been a great film if it had a plot and wasn't so focused on the female cast members bodies. I had high hopes because the leads were all women but I was disappointed. Also some of the dialog was just ridiculous. Women do not say stupid things like 'it makes my pussy wet'. The word 'pussy' was used so much I was actually wondering why all the women were talking like they starring in a porn. I felt like I was trapped in a frat boy's wet dream.\n\nThe people who wrote and directed this garbage should be embarrassed."

        "review_detailed_main": "If I ever wondered what someone could use as a torture device against me, I think I have found the answer. 1 out of ten isn't enough for this movie to describe how dreadful it was. First things first, this film was marketed as a comedy. Not one scene in the entire movie was funny, I never chuckled once. If anything this movie about killed my sense of humor for awhile. This movie doesn't even try to be funny, constant slow scenes with sad voices are not funny. The girls aren't even very hot almost all of them are sub par and this film presents the sexier scenes in an odd sort of way that isn't sexy at all.\n\nSo the film first starts off with a bunch of girls robbing a store because they don't have enough money. Which makes you think, how terrible must these girls be at planning, like anything. If all 4 of them had worked at McDonalds for just 2 months, they'd have over 1,000 dollars. Yet all they could find was 320, makes no sense. So of course this conveniently explains why 4 rich college girls are ruthlessly robbing a store (how often does this happen) and needlessly bashing everything that looks like glass with sledgehammers.\n\nSo then we finally get to the actual spring break, and for the next 30 minutes you will watch mostly the exact same scenes play out in front of you as you've already seen. At some point the film director arbitrarily decides that he doesn't want to make a movie about college partying, and instead decides he wants to make a gangster film. Now you'll watch as the movie glorifies guns and violence for the remaining duration of the film (meanwhile none of this has anything to do with spring break).\n\nAs a Britney Spears fan I also have to add my opinion about the scene with the song Every time. I felt very insulted to see Britney Spears and her song defiled by this movie showing constant scenes of people beating each other up, shooting each other, and generally just toting guns around like they were toys all while her song was playing.\n\nIf you are a Selena Gomez fan then I really recommend you stay away from this film. Firstly, because she isn't even in half of it. Secondly, because the movie is mainly about her friends doing bad things and while she stays out of it her friends basically become the focus of the film. Lastly because Selena Gomez herself said her fans shouldn't watch the movie.\n\nBut it isn't just Selena Gomez fans who shouldn't watch the film. No one should watch this film, it becomes unbearable to watch towards the end and succeeds in insulting almost every member of the human race. Personally this movie was everything I despised and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."

The playfulness between the 4 of them was rather annoying (LET'S ALL DO HEADSTANDS FOR NO REASON). The whole \"Gangsta Wannabe\" vibe was just sickening and overdone in my opinion. The repetition of lines was just way, way too much. Seriously the only 2 people who seemed to actually have dialog in this movie were James Franco and Selena Gomez. To me this seems like it could have been cut down to 3 minutes and made into a music video. To the people who have griped about the editing in this movie, after seeing it I absolutely agree with all of you. It's just a mess. I got pretty sick of seeing things out of order, or seeing James Franco smiling at the girls while you hear him speaking to them all out of time-frame. One more thing I have noticed is that if you don't like this movie and let it be known on the internet, that you will be pegged as an \"MTV Generation Lover\" and that you \"Just Don't Get It.\" I for one am not an MTV head, and I DO get what they were trying to say in this movie. Instant gratification and living the wild life will send you into a downward spiral. To me it just seems that Harmony Korine could have actually written more than a 3 to 4 page script and not have done this movie in such an MTV type of style."

In my eyes it a masterpiece that plays out like a dream with solid performances throughout and wonderful editing to involve the audience in the trip. The florescent colours and soundtrack add to the trippy quality of the film making for very entertaining viewing. Yes the film does not have a very linear story line but nor does it lack a story unlike some other Art-house films. The film chronicles a group of young girls decent from innocence into hellish chaos. Korine's selection of females to play the role included the former teen idol Vanessa Hudgens and her replacement in the form of Selena Gomez to play with our emotions and tarnish their good name thus strengthening the destruction of innocence. I originally felt James Franco was an idiotic choice to play a gangster rapper but he embodies the character so well that I could scarcely even begin to think of an alternative.\n\nKorine's best film and one of the best films to come out of Hollywood in a good while."

I mean, little girls who watch Disney/Pretty Little Liars would be obsessed with these girls and would think of them as role models and would have most probably been waiting forever to see this movie, only to find out they can't do so due to it being rated 18+. However, let's assume that a random little girl got access to this movie and watched it, what would she learn? Would Selena, Ashley and Vanessa be role models then? Or will they be participating in the diffusion of bad habits and in spreading bad influence among young teenage girls? It's sad to know that actresses nowadays would go this far just for the sake of getting some cash in. Also, I still can't help but think about the purpose behind this movie. At some point, I felt like I had intellectual problems because I couldn't understand the moral of this film; let along the purpose of it, but after seeing every single person who was watching it with me either fall asleep, or have no idea what was going on as well, I was relieved. But then, I was stupid enough to even reconsider watching it again so that I could at least find one little detail that made this movie a worthy one, and I happily decided NOT to do that to myself again. So I guess we really shouldn't judge a book by its cover, because what seems to be a great movie on the outside, with a well-known cast and big names, turned out to be an utter disappointment.\n\n-Sincerely, a girl who used to spend hours watching Disney channel and looking up to those young actresses."

        "review_detailed_main": "The latest from controversy-baiter Harmony Korine is yet another opinion-splitter. Focussing on the exploits of four bored girls who rob a bank to fund their trip to Florida in order to party and \"find themselves\" - only to become entangled in drugs, weapons and gangsters - Korine creates a lurid, confronting flick that is short on narrative and high on mood. Spring Breakers is essentially a string of montages set to dance and hip-hop tunes; the slick and well selected beats dictate the tempo and tell the tale. There are some choice scenes - a slow-mo sequence played against Britney Spear's \"Everytime\" is a highlight - and Korine has a bag of visually stylish tics up his sleeve, but how much you enjoy this down and dirty odyssey will be largely dependent on your tolerance levels of the languid and repetitive nature of the storytelling, as well as your taste in music. James Franco's gangster Alien is slimy yet charismatic, Selena Gomez is wooden as the impressionable Faith whilst Vanessa Hudgens unequivocally obliterates her Disney princess persona as the morally corrupt and money hungry Candy. One of those movies where the soundtrack is better than the actual film, this certainly isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea."

Almost as pitiful as this review - \"Its more then just spring break, its our chance to see something different.\" Four college friends are determined to make it to Florida for spring break this year. After saving up for many months they are still short cash for the trip. When one of them comes up with an idea to make money in an illegal way they decide that is the only way, this decision begins to change the girls way of thinking and when they meet Alien (Franco) things get even more out of control. Some can handle it and some can't. I have to start off by saying that this movie is pretty much exactly what you would expect from a movie called Spring Breakers. Lots of drug use, drinking and nudity. For a movie like this to have the cast it does makes the movie more intriguing to see (for me anyway) and they all do a good job in it that you forget who you are watching. The movie started off pretty exciting, the middle really drug but the ending makes you glad you stuck with it. This is by no means amazing or something to rush out and see, but it is a movie that has enough excitement in it to keep you watching and makes you glad you finished it. Overall, nothing too original but worth watching if you can handle it. I give it a B-. Dude, lay off the bong!"

With a budget of 5 million dollars, this movie did so much more. Spring Breakers was so deep, but it's rare for people to even care or notice symbols anymore in films.\n\nThink of most of the people who wrote horrible reviews, most likely a grown up fan base of Disney Stars like Vanessa Hudgens and Selena Gomez, do you really think that they were expecting to be satisfied with a movie with such creativeness to it.\n\nSure it's not even close to child appropriate but the contrasting of reality versus the luxuries of spring break was so captivating...honestly you have to watch it."

Soundtrack from Skrilexx is great and it describes atmosphere from wild teens in spring break. So I think that if you seen any of Korine movies you should pass this because you will be disappointed because you would except more but this movie is not provide any of that scenes. I hope that his next movie will be so much better then this one. 6/10"

Franco is a brilliant actor and without him, this movie would have been an utter disaster (or simply one more movie about young rebel girls who are shown partially naked and partying).\n\nThe female characters, four young adult spring breakers, are boring and contradictory on many levels. The young actresses who portrait them are not very skilled at acting (two of them in particular who should stick to singing) and they do not come across as authentic characters.\n\nThe time frame for this movie is about two weeks, and we have no information at all on the characters' backgrounds. Except a couple of minutes about Alien's relationship with his ex best friend. I believe that this created part of my disappointment, because I could not understand the dynamics between the four girls, who are very different from one another on specific levels.\n\nThis movie was definitely not the type of movie that I enjoy watching. This said, if you are into movies with partial nudity, partying, lots of drugs and tragic endings, you will enjoy Spring Breakers."

        "review_detailed_main": "Spring Breakers is an experience meant to feel like a blur once you finish it. When I was a Senior in High School, it was the word-of-mouth film everyone was talking about. Some said it was amazing and some said it was the worst film ever made. But those who saw it then, in large multiplexes, sadly knew nothing of it's creator Harmony Korine. The Godfather of hardcore hipster cinema. Surreal art pictures like Gummo and Trash Humpers. If you know what you're getting, you'll understand Spring Breakers, and realize that this is actually his most commercial film to date. If you don't know that, you probably wont like it at all. The right word for this is polarizing.\n\nSpring Breakers is intoxicatingly unpleasant. That's an oxymoron, but it's an apt description. Korine introduces us to these four girls. Right off the bat, you are repulsed by them. They come across as vapid seekers of cheap thrills, no matter how depraved and sadistic. Instead of getting money at the ATM, they arm rob a chicken restaurant. How sweet. Gomez plays the outlier of the group. A good Christian girl who sees nothing but trouble from the jump, and is the first to bail when things get real. Curiously, as Alien (James Franco) enters the scene, Gomez exists thereafter. We never see or hear from her again. I'll admit that this makes for shoddy character development, and at this point in his career, Korine should know better. But forget that. Just go with it.\n\nShots of sweaty bodies and beer guzzling occupy the frames of the wild parties these girls go to. Think of Project X, but artsier. At this point, we are introduced to Alien, played by James Franco. A low-life drug-dealer, small-time rapper and wealthy baddie, surrounded by cars, wads of cash and machine guns. He's a white trash train-wreck. Evidently, this may be James Franco's best onscreen role. At least until he played Tommy Wiseau, but does that even count as an original performance? He takes these girls under his wing, and trains them to be his personal hit squad.\n\nSpring Breakers is what it is. A nonsensical film about sex, dugs, alcohol, guns and crime in sunny Florida. In some ways, it's a cautionary tale about getting caught up in the wrong crowd. In other ways, it's a midnight stoner flick. I can't say it's a great film, but I don't think it's bad either. Once you are sucked in to this world, it's hard to come back out of it, and you end up being seduced by it's vile nature."

Spring Breakers has its moment, but never manages to fully deliver its potential, do not go out of your way to see it, but it's worth the watch if you happen to see it online or on television.\n\nFour students are drawn in to crime after they rob a store to fund their spring break.\n\nBest Performance: James Franco"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is suppose to be a cult movie or whatever but it's a bland superficial movie with no substance or entertainment. James Franco in a interview claimed superficial is not a bad thing because the whole society is like that. Which didn't make much sense and this movie shows otherwise kind of. Because the ending is just plain awful. When it comes to the vibe of this movie, it reminded me of the movie \"Savages\" except this one is crap. Maybe it's getting recognition because of the crazy electronic style with people partying like crazy. But besides that I don't really know why this movie has been getting positive responses. Besides James Franco's performance as this hustler that is a mix between lil jon/t.i. and a redneck. As a matter of fact he looked like the character from \"Malibu's Most Wanted\". The only thing that stands out about this movie, is how it goes in a unexpected direction sometimes but it isn't cleverly crafted or anything like that. I don't know if this movie is trying to show the epitome of the ugly side of superficial dumb and crazy people. But it leaves nothing after it's finished. There isn't anything controversial or even felt like it left a message. It's not thought provoking or leaves an impact by the end of this movie. It just seemed like a trashy art house movie that fails in just about every direction. It shows the craziness of spring break parties but you can see it anywhere online.\n\n3.3/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "You knew it was an R rated movie about spring break before you started watching Spring Breakers, didn't you?\n\nI'd say that I don't understand all the negative backlash surrounding this film, but I definitely do. There are a good amount of sex/drugs/violence related activities that are off-putting to many. I understand how the shock of seeing these scenes could turn off a person who is easily offended. However, it isn't as if this comes as a surprise to the viewer, the movie was promoted this way and you can surmise that Spring Breakers will have these sort of things simply from seeing a poster for the film. For that reason, I don't consider the complaints that people have made stating that sex/drugs/violence ruined this film for them to be valid.\n\nNow that I've addressed why Spring Breakers is rated so lowly, I'd like to tell you why this has been my favorite film of 2013. Firstly, the acting is absolutely perfect, and this is the best performance I've ever seen from James Franco. His portrayal of the character \"Alien\" is equally true to life and chilling. The leading ladies of Spring Breakers were all pleasant surprises as well. While Selena Gomez, Rachel Korine, and Vanessa Hudgens all gave very solid performances, I think that special accolades should be given to Ashley Benson whose portrayal of \"Brit\" was definitely a stand out performance. Even Gucci Mane was very believable, although it could be argued easily that he was just playing himself.\n\nSecondly, the partying scenes and prominent usage of the soundtrack that everyone complains about are absolutely essential for setting the backdrop for the story. The scenes feature real spring breakers and gives a very authentic feel to the girls' spring break location. Yes, they are graphic and could offend someone who is somehow not expecting nudity upon seeing the trailer, but there's a certain reality that is offered by those scenes that you just can't get from actors. Also, while others will complain about the soundtrack, it makes a good deal of sense to play party music during the party scenes and gangster music when the cast is engaging in illegal activity. It should also be noted that the score has a very haunting quality to it, and there are a few oddly placed ballads lending the same quality.\n\nThirdly, Spring Breakers features many flashbacks and foreshadowing during the scene changes, which I think serves beautifully to help the viewer both tie together things that seemed insignificant earlier and keep the viewer in a captive state of wonder as he/she anticipates when the momentary glimpse of the future just seen will come into play later. This style of scene change is especially fitting to the film because at many times, as the title lends, the characters are in hazy states and this style emphasizes that for the audience.\n\nSpring Breakers is highly entertaining, well made, and has the incredible ability to evoke emotion. What more could a person want in a movie?"

I actually lost attention many times and started doing other things only to force myself into watching this film without distraction. This film gives me a sense it's mocking all the clich\u00e9s being used in today's Hollywood film industries or America's dumbing-down popular culture. Examples: all the stock figures particularly the wigger gangster portrayed by James Franco, the over-the-top antiques from the 4 main girls. The dialogs is banal (\"spring break forever...\", \"we're finally going to see the world\".) it's laughable. The antics done by the characters are extremely humorous. Some scenes are just borderline on full-blown ridiculousness (playing a Britney Spears song on the piano, girls wearing pink masks totting guns, Florida white trash bearing silver teeth...). This is a very good comedy. Harmony Korine has done an excellent job calling this film a satire; a mockery of today's mindless youth behaviors and the pervasive stupidity among the masses, or could be a commentary on the absurdity of the Hollywood culture. But if he meant this film to be a \"serious\" thriller, it would be terrible."

I had hoped that because the movie was shot in such a good resolution and had actors like James Franco and Selena Gomez, that it would actually turn out to be a good movie, but I was not only disappointed, but enraged by this movie. Mr. Korine attempts to criticize society and the modern youth in this film but is sorely mistaken. His bitterness towards the \"MTV-inspired youth\" shows in this bias portrayal of college kids.\n\nThe movie portrays 4 friends (who play white-trash convicts) as they seek adventure in Florida during spring break. Along with augmented criticism towards fraternities, the movie portrays young, college kids doing drugs, binge drinking, and engaging in explicit behavior both publicly and in private. Though a lot of these behaviors are true in real life, Mr. Korine shows his bias nature by exaggerating all of these behaviors and throwing them all into the mix at once. Other than his uneducated criticism of today's college students Mr. Korine seems to lack basic direction skills. The movie is full of inappropriate mood changes, distasteful placement of dubstep music (keep in mind, I love dubstep) and 94 minutes of irritating and confusing camera angles and frames (from awkward close-ups to camera wobble).\n\nAll in all, this movie is god awful. I love boobs n beer as much as the next guy but this movie was just sad and ultimately painful to the eye."

        "review_detailed_main": "Spring Breakers isn't your typical coming-of-age story; it's a stark reflection of a generation's lost youth. The film follows four college girls who rob a restaurant to fund their spring break escapades. This seemingly reckless act reveals a deeper truth: their inner emptiness and desperate attempt to escape reality. Their immersion in alcohol, drugs, and sex, a pursuit of fleeting pleasure, ultimately leads to self-destruction. Their behavior evokes a sense of sadness and prompts reflection on the values and lifestyles of a younger generation.\n\nJames Franco delivers a standout performance as \"Alien,\" a character both alluring and sinister. His portrayal is nuanced and captivating, showcasing the complexities of his persona. His interactions with the four girls amplify the film's dark humor and satirical undertones.\n\nAlcohol, sex, and money are recurring themes, representing temptations that transcend time, age, and social class. They act as a numbing agent, providing temporary relief from anxieties, but ultimately leading to greater pain and disorientation. The film skillfully integrates these elements, exposing underlying social issues and human frailties.\n\nSpring Breakers is more than just entertainment; it's a social parable that encourages reflection on the younger generation. The film's atmosphere, set against its specific time period, incorporates innovative elements, enhancing its timeliness and artistic merit. It doesn't judge or condemn, but rather seeks to understand and depict the confusion and struggles of young people within a particular social context. The film leaves the audience pondering the complexities of youth, societal pressures, and the search for meaning in a seemingly chaotic world. The director's bold stylistic choices further enhance the film's impact, making it a memorable and thought-provoking cinematic experience."

In order to counter the mind-numbingly simple plot and premise of this movie, it attempted to be \"artistic\" through a series of never-ending montages and convoluted \"insightful\" dialog. The problem with this is the fact that the movie's producers kept reusing the same shots over and over and over again, coupled with the most narrow minded, know it all dialog. This most likely was done to hide the fact that the child-star actors casted in this movie couldn't actually deliver a full line of meaningful dialog.\n\nFurthermore, there was absolutely no trace of character development, direction, or motivation to help propel the plot. The entire movie just felt like a series of things happening; they wanted to go on spring break, they rob a store, they go on spring break, they get arrested.. blah blah blah. All of this was cut with endless shots of the girls running around half naked, getting wasted, and calling their grandmothers...? I managed to make it a little over 30 minutes into the movie until I simply couldn't tolerate it any longer. Even at the 40 minute mark, James Franco's character had yet to fully enter the storyline. Unless you're a 16 year old high schooler who's aspirations include getting black-out drunk, gang banged, and arrested, don't watch this garbage."

The movie's portrayal of the wild and spontaneous actions performed by the youth are a bit to bold, however, these actions are key in order to be able to depict this world accurately. With the addition of James Franco's character we see more and more dangerous activity being added to the already existing dangers present in the film making it seem that there has to be some level of violence in order to achieve something. Overall, Korine did a fine job in satirizing how ridiculous the youth is."

Lets be honest you go to college so you can be that guy or gal that doesn't have to turn to a life of crime to survive. You want to find a good job and provide for your family. That is what makes this movie more of a fantasy with a touch of reality then the other way around. The filming aspect of this movie is a masterpiece though. The director really know how to capture key moments of the movie and add just as much reality that was needed. I went to college and I can tell you that Spring Break is a time honored tradition where you literally go crazy for a week. The movie shows that through gratuitous nudity, drinking, and partying for the first half of the movie. It also exposes the loss of innocence when experiencing something new. The movie shows how four women are so focused on making memories and living in the moment that they forget about planning for their future. To actually understand what is going on in this movie you have to be able to relate. I am not talking about relating to being a bad girl or a hardened criminal. I am talking about understanding that sometimes in life you do things out of the ordinary to live in the moment and forget the life that you actually know. If you don't see a little of yourself in this movie then my friend you need to live more."

In the end, there are people who see beneath the loud and flashy surface and people who don't. In order to close this discussion and go on to something really remarkable about Korine's work, I just want to point out that it is a movie worth watching in many ways, because it is entertaining, ambitious and brave.\n\nThe story of Spring Breakers is simple and a one dimensional tour to excess. But the way Korine narrates the story with a unique montage concept is remarkable. Looking closer at the plot, we see various fermatas interrupting the plot, e.g. Alien playing the white grand piano, his bloody finger tipping the key, the threesome in the pool and so on. These scenes work like interruptions changing the course of the story like joints. And for the montage these scenes work like a prism, projecting the following events in achronological inserts. In this way, Spring Breakers works brilliantly as a composition of music, sound and light. And in the end, it leaves the audience dazzled and thinking."

        "review_detailed_main": "When Disney stars go bad... I guess this happens. Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens star in this movie, which takes them far from their previous roles in Disney and family material. I can tell you that this is not a family movie. Spring Breakers is a modern take on what people in our modern society do these days at the age of these particular girls and then what the consequences can be. It follows the four title girls on a quest to have the best spring break ever. So, they try to rob a store, but they end up getting arrested and bailed out by an arms & drugs dealer, who takes them into a life of partying, drugs, craziness, etc etc.\n\nI originally wanted to see this film to see how the Disney princesses (Gomez and Hudgens) could transform themselves into such an adult role. Additionally, I'm always interested in the Harmony Korine's films because they're so different and really stand out, even though only one of his films has actually been good. Spring Breakers, on its roots, is a party movie and I can only enjoy a party movie if its characters and events are written well. That was the problem I had with recent party movies like 21 And Over and Project X; they lacked depth or anything characters for the viewer to get into. Thankfully, Harmony Korine is a good writer, because this movie is pretty interesting and deep.\n\nThe first half of this movie is pretty much a really big music video because we just see partying and women with little clothes on. It's sort of dragging and nothing is really happening that's good for the movie. All we see is the provocative stuff that all the teens paid to see: girls, boobs, music. But the movie really picks up in the second half when James Franco's character comes in. James Franco is an awesome actor with great range; and he really gets into this role as the arm & drugs dealer that brings the girls into the life of trouble-making and craziness. From then on, the movie is very unpredictable and deep, and I really like that. As far the girls, their performances are good as well (just not as great as James Franco, but he's awesome) as you see their lives fall into crime and drugs and the underground world. There are several scenes where it gets emotional or pretty crazy and it actually kept me invested in the movie.\n\nOverall, I was very surprised by this movie. It was a completely different tone in the second half and I was really engrossed into that. The writing and directing styles of Korine is unique and sometimes even hypnotic, as well the acting by the main characters being entertaining. Though, the beginning wasn't particularly enjoyable, this movie is still very unique and the second half just sorta draws you in"

        "review_detailed_main": "To start with I liked the movie \"Kids\", the script for which was co-written by Spring Breakers director Harmony Korine. However I am left wondering if Korine should have also entrusted this script to \"Kids\" director Larry Clark because the movie it most reminded me of was Clark's \"Bully\". Both movies had young bodies on prominent display, hyper-sexuality, a pervasive sense of menace and seemingly vacuous main characters. However, Bully is at least partially based on a true story and the soullessness of the main characters are made disturbing only by its basis in reality and because there is some attempt at development and back story.\n\nHowever, after watching Spring Breakers the only thing that disturbed me was the hour and a half I just wasted. Although I eventually found the short-cut mix-mash style of editing tedious, there is some effort to make the movie visually interesting beyond the obvious eye candy of a movie set in a fantasy world of the ultimate hormone and drug fuelled Spring Break. On that basis alone, and the only reason I didn't give it one or two stars, it can be distinguished from the \"frat boys getting laid\" comedy the title suggests, or the \"guns n bitches\" Hip Hop music video it came very close to emulating. However, each time the movie attempts to surprise and develop what might seem to be an interesting plot line, it spins off in yet another direction. Surprise is offered in lieu of content.\n\nThe only shadow of a character in the whole movie was offered by James Franco. However, the movie centers around four female protagonists and each time one of them was in danger of becoming a real human being she disappears. The potent sense of tension and danger hinted at throughout the film never pays off. Any chance at provoking thought on the vacuous hedonism on display is lost What is left is a silly unreal ending involving unreal people."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I sat down after travelling back across the city, a friend put it best: \"There is no other film that will bring out film majors and general audiences in equal proportions on any given opening weekend.\" He was right, and somehow it was Harmony Korine who had done it. Zeitgeist, name actors, and the chronic daring of anyone Werner Herzog would claim as a \"soldier of cinema\" were what likely made for the winning juice.\n\nOr the failing juice, wherein the duped mass-market filmgoers were concerned. As another friend wrote, \"If you never listen to any other advice in your life but this, it's worth it: Do not see Spring Breakers. Ever.\" Although a following chorus of \"y'alls\" and \"spring break forevers\" left her seeming a little disingenuous, as with most films there will be disappointed people who presupposed what it was they were buying.\n\nHedonistic Florida, popular young actresses stripped naked or thereabouts in the company of others perpetually so, James Franco as a freak gangsta touting every bell and whistle, primitive violence, and a dub-step soundtrack are what is collectively up for sale. On those terms, a general audience is set to conclude.\n\nFilm majors have a bigger dish. Spring Breakers being the fifth film by Harmony Korine and the latest in photography from Beno\u00eet Debie are likely the greatest of its cinephile incentives. Personally, I know that my own twelve dollars left casually.\n\nFor how it played, the film was simple, although elegantly staged. As expected in anything from Korine, it held a candid crudeness and energy dissimilar to popular cinema in its consciousness and winning punch. How it resolves itself and what it amounts to are questionable, but, with thanks to Debie, there are few moodier experiences involving faces we may have once associated with the straight-edge partaking in the illicit, dirty and lowdown for the ingestion of a camera.\n\nUltimately, Spring Breakers is a film that arrived on a Good Friday with another rebel on a cross for his conviction. It is a sensuous personal film before it is a cold blockbuster, and it decides against being equal portions of both to the consternation and apparent anger of the mass-market \u2014 like always with Korine. This would likely account for the many one-out-of-ten ratings from the prestigious community on IMDb.\n\nAt the end of the day, I'd recommend the standard process of seeing a film for yourself and establishing your own opinion, or purchasing Monte Carlo, a much nicer film about Selena Gomez and her friends in an exotic location."

To make it even worse the movie tries to depict 'flash backs' throughout, but in reality they are just chopped up repeats from earlier the film that had no meaning or place in the earlier or latter part of the movie.\n\nI honestly cannot think of anything positive to say about this movie, seeing a few women in bikini was probably the most entertaining which really shows how bad this film really is!\n\nI have no idea where all or any of the higher end reviews have come from, but don't waste your time watching this."

I don't even think I would've sat through this if I were 14 - and I loved bad and rotten movies when I was 14. Seriously, everything about this movie was completely horrific and unwatchable. Why was money even wasted to produce this thing? And why did my friends tell me to watch it? I suspect it must have been a joke that they were playing on me - there is really no explanation as to why anyone would recommend watching this garbage."

Basically, it shows what our society strives to be. That is, it's what happens when one doesn't give a damn about anything. Much like how the characters in \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\" fall prey to greed, the protagonists here fall prey to their thrill-seeking inclinations.\n\nThere have been debates as to whether the movie objectifies or empowers women. It's hard to say. Vanessa Hudgens, Selena Gomez, Ashley Benson and Rachel Korine do appear a lot in their bikinis - probably with the intent of showing off their bodies - but they don't take crap from anyone.\n\nThe point is that this is not a movie like any other that you've seen. The naturalistic cinematography and raw language make it one of the most realistic movies out there. You have to see it to understand the shock value. I do recommend it, as long as you realize what sort of movie you're in for."

I thought this movie would be a nostalgic look into the modern equivalent of coming of age with these young kitty cats spreading their wings and discovering a little fun in the sun. I was wrong, yes it is about an adventure at the beach but includes some very illegal activities and some extremely bad decision making. I know I am too old for their target demographics but I think you should wait until it comes out on DVD if you must see it, otherwise be warned, sex, drugs, and rock and roll or rather hip hop simply don't look too much fun on those white sandy beaches."

It felt more like a glorified pornography film rather than a piece of cinematography. We considered walking out before the end but assumed that SOMETHING must happen...unfortunately, the 'film' did not deliver anything of note. Instead, Springbreakers delivered a script which could not have been longer than a side of A4 page, repeated over and over again, for 'effect'. Whatever that effect was, it served more as an annoyance than anything else. It distinctly felt like the director was attempting to be edgy and taboo through showing teenagers taking drugs and having sex, this, however, is nothing new and is quite boring to watch. At times. it was uncomfortably cringe-worthy and plain distasteful. At the end of the movie, which could not have come sooner, our fellow cinema goers agreed that the film was utterly awful and that there was absolutely no point to it whatsoever. I have never been so unmoved and uninspired by a movie. A truly palpable waste of time. Do not waste your money on the cinema ticket."

I remember seeing the previews and thinking \"Just another crappy teen party movie.\" But, then I heard an interesting piece of information: this film was directed by Harmony Korine. You know, that critically acclaimed director who has one of the most experimental styles in film today. So, this struck my interest. So, I rented it, and here's my thoughts. I saw another review on here that has the summary title, \"A Lot Of Style, Not Enough Plot\" or something around those lines. And, those are probably my feelings, too. This film is drenched in art house nuances, from the lighting to weird constant repeated line voice overs. I also enjoyed that during the party sequences, the camera switches to this weird, distorted kind of thing that looks absolutely incredible. James Franco, Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudges (However you spell that) all give great performances. However, that's all the good I can really say about this movie. I mean, the story is nothing that interesting, but the style was enough to keep me interested in the running time. Check it out for some artsy, avant-garde film making."

One already saturates at the 45 minute mark and finishing this meaningless story is an absolute ordeal.\n\nOnly satisfactions: James Franco, quite exceptional as a nutty dealer, and the aesthetics sometimes quite interesting, which is not enough to compensate for the abyssal quality of the script."

Let me start by telling you that I am from a third world country so I don't get the hype of Spring breaks in America. The only school break I have known through out my student years is summer break.\n\nThe movie for me is like a deep dark gelatin sprinkled with a touch of rainbow candy sprinklers experimented by a strange director. James Franco was good though in portraying his character and in delivering his lines with a unique gangster style.\n\nI have qualms with the way the story is being told, you have to give the movie your utmost attention in order to understand what is going on.\n\nI give this movie a 6 out of 10. A point deducted for the way Vanessa Hudgens portrayed his role, I think it was kinda weird watching her especially when she delivered her lines. Another point for the way James Franco died in this movie. I mean your a Gangster with a lot of weapons and ammunition, and you only brought a Glock customized semi-automatic Uzi without reload to an enemy guarded mansion? Not to mention that he did not kill any enemy goons nor fired a single shot.\n\nAnother point is deducted for the unrealistic siege of Archie's Mansion. Archie's henchmen must be all blind for not being able to hit the girls in point blank range. The last point is deducted for the unlimited ammo of the Uzi Brit and Candy is using. I mean the automatic weapon spurts at least 3 to 5 bullets per second and the magazine can hold about 25 to 30 shots but they manage to kill all the goons including Archie with that very same weapon without reloading."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you are going into this movie expecting a non-stop party movie like Project X or 21 and Over, you aren't gonna get what you were expecting. Instead you are going to get a movie that features partying, but the main focus being the twisted minds of some of these young women.\n\nSpring Breakers is the story about three wild party girls (Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson, Rachel Korine) and their easy going friend (Selena Gomez) who want to leave school for spring break but don't quite have the money yet. The only way to resolve this in the eyes of the before mentioned three girls decide to rob a restaurant and get money for their spring break trip. When the girls get there they start doing what they came their to do and ended up getting arrested and later bailed out by a gangster named Alien (James Franco)and then things suddenly change for these girls.\n\nI went in this movie with an open mind and not seeing the trailers and even though it was hard to watch sometimes; I respect what the director (Harmony Korine) achieved. He had a great style of shooting and I really appreciated what he has doing. There are times where their is a voice over over a scene of partying and then two minutes later, the scene where the voice over was being spoke came. I think that was pretty cool and really haven't seen anything like that. The performances were pretty decent. The three girls who were wild and crazy played their part like I would imagine, pretty annoying but that is the point. Selena has the innocent girl who tags along worked out very well and James Franco as Alien is hilarious. He can do that role of a goofy wannabe gangster off pretty well. The tone of the film was pretty dark and I think that worked pretty well. Like I said before, it's not a non-stop party movie like it looks like. It gets very dark and very deep and I think that alone makes it better.\n\nA few people left the theater when I saw this and I understand why they did, it wasn't what they expected. Either you like or you hate it. If you aren't digging it 15 minutes in, you won't dig the other 75 minutes. There is more substance in this film that those other party movies. It does have flaws, its hard to watch. Some of the things these girls say, think, and do make you uncomfortable and question is this what society has come down to. It does open your eyes to the world we live in now where the stuff seen in this movie is what people do now. The second half of this movie gets very hard to watch and takes a direction that I think hurt the film. But its not that hard to make it through it.\n\nOverall, its a different kind of movie but with a nice directorial twist. It is a tale of two halves. I am not going to recommend you watch this movie and theaters and this movie is a coin flip on whether you not you like it. Wait for the Redbox or Netflix if you want to watch it.\n\n2.5 out of 5 stars.\n\nbkstaReviews.blogspot.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Spring Breakers\" stars James Franco, Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson, and Rachel Korine. The film is directed by Harmony Korine, who brought us \"Gummo\" (1997), and \"Trash Humpers\" (2009).\n\nThe film is about these four girls in college who are planning on going on Spring break but due to money issues they are unable to go. The only solution these girls have is by robbing a diner, which they do. Once on Spring break they party, drink, and do drugs. One day they are arrested for possession of drugs/doing drugs. They are bailed out by Alien, who is a rapper, drug hustler, and arms dealer. Alien takes the girls under his wing to show them what Spring break is all about.\n\nI'll be honest I was very surprised with this film, it was better than I'd expected. Harmony Korine is one of the most stylized and original directors in the film industry, the only thing is that all of his films receive average to negative reviews. With \"Spring Breakers\" he finally landed a film with enough positive criticism so he can finally be seen and heard.\n\n\"Spring Breakers\" targets the youth of today's society, social media, art, and most of all Spring break. The very first minute of the film demonstrates what's later to come throughout the duration of this movie. The opening of this movie is a bunch of young men and women partying, and drinking on a beach. The thing that mostly affected me were what the people were doing and the way they were presented, they acted like barbaric animals, it definitely demonstrated what Spring break is all about within just one minute.\n\nJames Franco gives the best performance of his entire career so far in this film, I'm very surprised he did not get an Oscar nomination for his transformative role as this gross and disgusting human being. The film looks beautiful, if you love neon lighting this movie is for you. This movie should've been called \"Neon Porn\" instead.\n\nThroughout the film you wonder what more trouble are these girls going to get into next and it just keeps getting worse. This film demonstrates very poor decision making from the younger generation. But hey, they want to party and do tons of illegal activities! Who can blame them!? (Being sarcastic).\n\nA couple of issues I have with the film is that it has a lot of female nudity. Now I have nothing against the female body but I felt that it was just a distraction from the film's story and heavily exploited women . Now if I was twelve years old and saw this film I wouldn't have had a problem with it. The film is very repetitive with its dialogue, the characters will say the same thing multiple times, and it gets very distracting. The first 20 or 30 minutes are pretty slow, and you're left waiting for when the film is ready to pick up. Once James Franco is on the screen the film is solid throughout.\n\nOne thing that I do like about this film is that it has a lot of literary devices in it. You have a lot of imagery, and foreshadowing. I didn't think this film would be so literary but it was and it surprised me a lot.\n\nOverall \"Spring Breakers\" is a solid film by Harmony Korine, and demonstrates an interesting story about Spring break and all the things that can possibly go wrong with it. One thing I must point out is that this is a drama. For those of you who are looking for the next \"American Pie\" (1999), you're not going to find it with \"Spring Breakers\". Now if you don't like artsy films you will most likely not like this movie because it is very very artsy. Check out \"Spring Breakers\", it is better than what most people say it is, but hey I have my opinions and you have yours so see it if you want."

A summary is...partying, porn, drinking, sex. I totally wasted a half hour of my life (I stopped watching it after that). I really don't like to give bad reviews, and if I don't like a movie I usually just keep it to myself. However, I'm writing this as a warning to anyone who plans on watching this........................PLEASE DON'T! I checked out the trailer and I was like\"Hey, this looks trashy but it has my favorite actresses, so I'll try it.\" Trust me, if they are actresses you like, you will want to skip this movie because you will just think more lowly of them. Now, I think I will go clean my mind and watch Cinderella lol (Seriously though.. I'm a full grown teen, but this will probably be the only thing that will calm me down now)."

It's nothing more than an explicit, extended MTV music video made for horny little boys to catch glimpse of some boobies..though they'd be better off with a \"girls gone wild\" video because at least they wouldn't have to suffer through the monotonous pretense of a plot line in between the topless scenes. Oh and **spoiler alert!** the only one of the main starlets who takes her top off (the directors wife) doesn't have anything that great to look at. This is not profound or thought provoking. This is not art. This is not even entertaining (unless you're 13 and have never seen boobs before). This is a sad, exploitation of young girls who were convinced to do something stupid and ultimately bad for their acting careers. The only actor who was decent in this movie was Franco. But still, just don't waste your time with this silly, trying so hard to be a Woody Allen-esque, film."

Although it has a plot twist and was suppose to shock the audience , I didn't feel the unexpected . Besides that the movie has many experienced actors such as, James Franco, Vannesa Hudges, and Selena Gomez. The movie starts off as just these girls trying to come up with some money to enjoy their spring break . One girl who's which a Christian, she doesn't agree with the rest of the girls' decision on how they get the money, but still goes on the break anyhow . Once they see the ' good life ' on break , they realize reality has hit and end up choosing a different lifestyle that tests their own friendship . James Franco is my favorite in this film because he acts a different lifestyle and makes it believable."

        "review_title": "Not what you might expect",
        "review_detailed_main": "If you go into \"Spring Breakers\" expecting a dumbed-down, flesh-jiggling sex romp, you may be sorely disappointed. What you'll get instead is a sobering cautionary tale about four sexy coeds who get more than they bargained for when they head down to St. Petes for a week of fun-and-games in the Florida sun.\n\nThe allegorically named Faith (Selena Gomez) is a good Christian girl who yearns for a chance to break free of the confines of her tedious college life and thinks spring break the way to do it. The problem is that she and her three girlfriends don't have enough money to make the trip. So they opt to steal a car and hold up a diner, then use their ill-gotten gains to get them to where they want to go. After a few days getting stoned and plastered, the girls find themselves in jail with no one to bail them out. Enter \"Alien\" (James Franco), an uber-creepy street hustler with a mouth full of silver teeth who posts the money they need on the condition they spend some time with him. What is he up to, and can a venture that started on such a violent note end on anything but?\n\nThe thing \"Spring Breakers\" has most going for it is its total lack of predictability, for just as you think you know where it's headed, it turns right around and goes off in a different direction entirely. The girls remain strangely underdeveloped and undifferentiated throughout (except for Selena), but, in a way, that's perfectly in keeping with the theme of female objectification that permeates the work.\n\nWriter/director Harmony Korine has conceived the work almost as a tone-poem, with long lyrical stretches punctuated periodically by the sound of a cocking rifle. That symbol for the ever-looming threat of violence serves as the refrain for the story the movie is telling. Some of the scenes are astonishingly realistic, while others have an almost hallucinatory quality to them. This makes it so that we don't really question the plausibility of some of the plot choices Korine makes. It's all in the service of the thesis that there's a yearning \"to be bad\" lurking deep inside each and every one of us. All it needs is that one special circumstance to set it free.\n\n\"Spring Breakers\" is one of those odd films that keeps hammering us with titillating visuals, while at the same time warning us against the dangers of partaking in what it's showing us.\n\nIt may make you depressed about the youth of today and make you despair over the future of the nation, but, love it or hate it, as a movie, \"Spring Breakers\" is definitely a one-of-a-kind experience."

The narrative structure in his other films like gummo and Julien Donkey boy are more alternative and free flowing. I feel like this visual quality of this film has also more professional than Korines other films.\n\nCasting the young Disney channel girls is such a marketing move. Everyone want's to watch the young innocent generation get corrupted. Thats exactly what happens in Spring Breakers.\n\nI like this film and think that if you are a fan of Korines work you will like it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Starting off, I only saw this film because it had James Franco in it (as I can imagine a lot of you did as well). The plot is a very simple \"quid pro quo\" where Hannibal Lector ends up at spring break, meets some demented teenagers who finally come to their senses and go on a last hunting spree to free themselves from this terrible world of drugs, sex and alcohol. The film has quality but doesn't know how to express them well, for example the very eighties lighting and use of colour is a highlight of this film. The montage has interesting psychedelic effects, but they don't really add to the atmosphere nor do I feel that they show how you would experience any of these substances. When it comes to scenery you can see this film is made after 2010, heavily influenced by music videos and a strong stress on tits and ass. There is barely use of metaphorical play (aka META), a scene where the girls stroke each other and play games in the hallway of their dorms shows their innocence, but there is no counterweight where they lose it so it feels like a fleeting moment of inspiration from the writer. I still gave it a 6 for the ideas it holds as they are becoming part of our modern culture, alas having a poor execution."

        "review_detailed_main": "Spring Breakers, by all means, is not a great film. I'm not even sure if it's even a good one, but it sparks some interesting conversations.\n\nThe gratuitous nudity and drug-fetishization take center stage over much of the plot of this film. Much of the acting is dreadfully unsubtle, hammed up or incredibly cliche, especially Franco and Gomez's characters. If you removed all of the drawn-out sequences of pop-music, cringe-worthy voice over, and 'Girls Gone Wild' b-roll, there would be little left in terms of substance.\n\nAll that being said, this film is fascinating as a time capsule. It does so much to capture the exact feeling of youthfulness in the early 2010s; e.g. The Skrillex intro; the trashy party aesthetic via Kesha, Black Eyed Peas, or LMFAO; the strange juxtaposition of suburban sorority girls and cash-money drug kingpins, etc. Even with all of it's flaws it hooks its claws into the nostalgia gland deep within your psyche and drags you back into a time enveloped in pop music that everyone knew was terrible, but loved anyway.\n\nEven though this film is quintessentially 2010s, I can't help but think it was incredibly influential to many down the line, I just can't tell whether this was good or bad. I see Franco's performance peek through later in Jared Leto's Joker and through personas like 6ix9ine. This style of cinema, a style that uniquely displays contemporary American depravity, would go on to produce films like The Florida Project, Goodtime, and Uncut Gems, all of which are stellar (much better) films.\n\nOverall, if you're not a sexually-obsessed teenager who gawks at drugs, money and guns like they haven't been around forever, you likely will not enjoy this film. I think it's important for the American film canon, but ultimately not worth revisiting."

I stayed to the end because one of my friends wanted to see how it ended. After it finally, mercifully ended, many people in the theater laughed because it was so absurdly bad.\n\nI can understand how some of the scenes were shot in interesting and artistic ways. Additionally, some of it could be viewed as commenting on aspects of society in original ways. But...\n\nThe acting was bad. The plot was atrocious. Most of the time, I couldn't even find humor in how bad it was because it was to repetitive and monotonous, so I was simply bored and frustrated. I have never seen a movie repeat lines like this one did. Was that supposed to be a joke? I would have rather watched previews, commercials and messages to turn of my cell phone for 2 hours than this movie. Please do yourself a favor and avoid it."

I hated Gucci Mane in this, I hated his performance and character and made the film boring and lose its focus.\n\nNow the pros: James Franco was hilarious in the role, he was scary, funny, over the top and very likable. The girls specially Selena Gomez were great, they played the roles of dumb wild girls really well. And the biggest pro of the film is its style, holy s**t every shot of the film is gorgeous candy colored highly saturated.

He is a genius almost along the lines of Depp in diverse characters. The lighting and cinematography were very fitting for this movie and gave the illusion of a real life documentary (I thought this was based on real events). Considering the ending of a movie is so critical to it being enjoyable, this shocking and thought provoking ending will have you torn between odd and amazing.\n\nHowever, I think it could have been a far better and higher rated movie had the slow story line added more story elements (or at least had them less hidden), maybe play more on their crime spree than on their romance so the viewer can hate them more as the dangerous, greedy criminals they are. The very strong message against today's \"gangsta, bitch-ho, Benjamins\" culture - which made me up my rating - was also hidden quite well.\n\nBut understand, in my experience an IMDb rating of 6 is nonetheless relatively decent."

Selena Gomez good for you for only being in the movie for tiny bit. Definitely could of been funnier. This was propaganda and just creates more stupid people in this world.

Its docudrama feel was enhanced by its unknown cast. That's certainly not the case here in Spring Breakers. This movie stars 2 Disney princesses Vanessa Hudgens and Selena Gomez plus Ashley Benson and Harmony's other half Rachel Korine. Obviously this is all about a couple of Disney princesses trying to show that they're all grown up. James Franco does an admirable job as an outlandish rapper. But at no time does any reality seep into this movie. Harmony made this candy color coated confection and it's just as emotionally satisfying as a tub of ice cream. It's a whole lot of empty calories, and you'll sugar crash right after."

As a person who has seen many movies in my life I have seen my fair share of bad movies.. This, however, takes the cake.. The movie is literally just drug use scenes, half naked barely legal girls, a creepy and dramatic musical number of the stars singing Brittney Spears and James Franco whispering 'spring break forever'. If you say you like this movie then it's just because you fan-girl over Selena Gomez and Vannessa Hudgens.. The way it was shot was not bad but suited more to a indie film style. Not a film with half the cast taken from Disney.. This movie was a flop and if you spend money on seeing this movie i feel sorry for you.\n\nIt is the worst movie i have ever seen."

I consider this a veritable masterpiece.\n\n2) The dialog and acting is HIGH above par - superb, actually. I haven't seen a film with such quality of realistic-ness (realism?) in ALL its cast in quite a while.\n\n3) The soundtrack is an excellently crafted part of the whole thing -- it fits perfectly with each scene and is generally just.... really good.\n\n4) The overall aesthetic and experience is AWESOME. And \"awesome\" is truly one of the few aptly descriptive words for this type of art -- (it should, and shall, be reserved for the greatest).\n\nMust see for fans of Lynch, Tarantino, Aronofsky, Ritchie, Boyle etc."

        "review_detailed_main": "Babes gone bad. A simple enough premise, set around teenyboppers who just cannot wait to break their goody-two-shoes mould, and take on something grittier on film. Written and directed by Harmony Korine, Spring Breakers is that film you may feel nauseous when sitting through, no thanks to its psychedelic colours, repetitive voiceovers, in your face camera angles, and non linear chronological presentation that seemed high on moving backward and forward to rock your cognitive balance deliberately, providing that first hand experience on the perpetual state of high the characters all seem hooked on in their search for hedonism and narcotic nirvana.\n\nIt's like a guys wet dream fantasy come alive when dealing with characters who are uninhibited in wanting to try crazy stuff, and the story follows four college girls - Candy (Vanessa Hudgens), Brit (Ashley Benson), Cotty (Rachel Korine, wife of the writer-director) and Faith (Selena Gomez), the latter playing that religious girl enticed into the life of hard partying by friends who resorted to robbing a restaurant to fuel their spring break vacation. Then it's scene after scene of merry making, sometimes with the aid of drugs, that we see the drowning of values within Faith as she falls deeper into the rabbit hole of trouble.\n\nFaith may be the character differentiated enough from the rest of her friends, but it's a little bit limited to what she can do, given the subject of peer pressure. The others were bland one-dimensional characters who bond deeper because of their clique that had survived an almost impossible pulling off of a robbery, catching the eye of Alien (James Franco), who decided to help the girls out of jail, posting their bail and taking them under his crooked wing.\n\nJames Franco stood out for being the thorn amongst the warped roses, and credit to the makeup and wardrobe team for completely knocking off his good looks, and replacing it with a gangsta inspired wardrobe with metallic braces, sun shades and plenty of tattoos. But the outfit doesn't make the character, and Franco owns it as Alien, a rapper cum drug dealer/distributor, complete with small army and a fortune to go on the recruitment hunt that would put the fun-seeking girls in his predatory path.\n\nIt's ultimately light in treatment, trying its best to ramp up the final act with the introduction of a gang rival, and the extent of rot the girls descended into, courtesy of the seduction from the dark side. There's little pleasure obtained from watching the movie, like a desperate exercise by the cast to show off how nasty they can actually be for film, playing to the fantasy of the filmmaker."

        "review_title": "It's good to go away from reality to find you are dumb!",
        "review_detailed_main": "During the final reel of this supposedly masterful observation about the degradation of American culture, Ashley Benson's character 'Brit' calls up her mother to assure her that she is fine and has had a wonderful experience in which she discovered herself. She explains that her experiences during Spring Break in Florida enabled her to discover herself and was glad that she was away from reality. I do not know about Brit but in reality everyone goes on a spring break to have a good time. How miserable your life has to be to find enlightenment on a spring break. Reality in this dull piece of film making, story is very thin. The director was definitely away from reality. He just forgot he was supposed to tell a story. The 95 minutes of runtime feels bloated with misogyny and the director would have served better if he had made a short film.\n\nLet's get to the myths surrounding this movie. First of all there is no observation of any kind regarding any culture. Each and every culture has gangsters and thieves in a large party town. Each year college students from across America go to beach-side areas at the advent of spring coinciding with a certain one week college breaks between the semesters. They go to party and try to have a great time before the business end of their college semesters. No one is going there to look out for danger nor anyone is turned on by guns and gangsters. There is definitely a large amount of activity that is considered immoral. But that is easy target if the director wants to say it is a slippery slope.\n\nWe all have seen what spring break down in Florida is and are aware what goes on over there. But still the director and James Franco insist the movie to be culturally important for this generation with new age story telling method that is an inspiration to new film makers. I am praying for next generation of audience if this is what we are served as culture examination because this movie reminded me of those B grade movies like Wild Orchid that had stories situated at places with loose morals.\n\nWhat did the director achieved by showing topless girls again and again getting drunk and forced to get drunk other than enforcing a cultural stereotype. Showing those images over and over with interjecting storyline about four small town girls creates a perverted image that girls ask to be exploited. And those small town girls are frustrated with their quiet life and have some immature fantasy about an exciting life. It is supposed to be comedy but becomes a very dark exploitative movie. The male counterpart to these college going spring breakers are missing and are portrayed by extras who are enjoying and having good time next to submissive girls. Any stories about male college student's behavior in Hollywood are always frat boy comedies in which boys will be boys image is enforced to laugh off their antics. But over here boys are the victims of robbery by these girls who are constantly mentioned as bitches.\n\nThe countless images of female body flesh and drugs along with showing the girls take a leak on the street with gleeful excitement was anything but mature filmmaking. If the director's argument is such kind of behavior is common hence have to be shown then at least revolve it around a story. Audience has not come over to witness exhibitionist dumb behavior with James Franco's character 'Alien' constantly whispering 'Spriing break y'll'. How irritating James Franco has become after everyone thoroughly enjoyed '127 hours'!\n\nThe reality is every kind of perversion trick was used. The stunt casting of Disney darlings Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens to piggy back movie's publicity on their popularity was ill conceived. Due to their pop culture image the antics of their characters definitely came off as dumb and they fail to shore up any audience interest or sympathy (if they needed any) for their characters.\n\nThe exploits of these female characters by being submissive and naive in male dominated world does not require deep observation to conclude this movie being director's male fantasy. But in between the audience end up with four dumb characters who decide whether to stay in a certain situation or not only if they are physically threatened or shot. Until then they think a breaded and tattooed guy named alien talking about rape and gang bang is perfectly fine gentleman to hang out with."

        "review_detailed_main": "Oftentimes people will have incorrect expectations when viewing a film. This generally happens with more hyped up films, and I think the biggest example of this is of Welles' \"Citizen Kane\". You're probably wondering why I would compare such a film as Korine's \"Spring Breakers\" to something that's considered to be the greatest film of all time, and they honestly have little in common besides the fact that people seem to expect such great (or, flat-out different) things from each film.\n\nSpring Breakers is something of a mixture of genres; each with their own specific feel. It's part avant-garde, part crime comedy, and part satire. It's honestly quite different from any other film I've ever seen.\n\nKorine uses colours in Spring Breakers to give a psychedelic experience, along with images of the \"good life\" of partying, sexual images, drugs, etc. in order to really get the viewer wrapped up in the feel and the lust for these kinds of things, but Korine doesn't do this to encourage the viewer, but rather the opposite.\n\nThe film has an incredible amount of flashbacks. I'd say about 75% of the images in the film are shown again at some point or another. I equate this as Korine is almost showing a memory of a party; you don't remember things in chronological order necessarily, but rather in order of importance, and oftentimes one remembers something over and over if it was particularly...memorable.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of the film was that it started out with this trippy half hour, but it slowly turned into a more plot-based film that was more of a crime-drama than this avant-garde looking flick that could have made Stan Brakhage proud. It then slowly degenerated back into this flurry of lights and sounds, perhaps reflecting on the party life never ending and always just repeating itself.\n\nWhile Franco gives an excellent performance, the girls are mostly wooden in acting. Whether or not this was intentional, I'm not sure. Perhaps it was done due to not give anyone emotional attachment to any of the characters? If so, it would fit hand-in-hand with the total lack of character development.\n\nEven though the film is unique in execution, its message, or rather in this case what it satirizes, has been done since the sixties, if not earlier. It seems as if it was a cop-out in this sense, but luckily it was creative enough to bring something new to the table.\n\nRating: 8/10"

Franco essentially plays the personification of the white stereotype of blackness. He looks dumber than ever with cornrows and that grill. If Harmony had half a brain and wasn't so trained in on a stereotype rather than a rich culture, he would have had the Gucci Man play that role. I was generous enough to give this 1 star because it is an accurate representation of the lemming-like mentality of spring breakers. The girls can't act a lick, but at least they are hot. There is no character development whatsoever. It boggles the mind how something like this can get green-lit."

I'm really surprised that James Franco took this role. The writing in this movie lacks any creativity whatsoever. The four primary characters bear more of a resemblance to ditsy bimbos in a porno than any college kids I've ever seen. To sum this up as a mirror for the milieu of youth in this country is the only redeeming factor, but KIDS was doing the same thing in 1995, and did a far better job at it.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something - I really dig Harmonie Korine and I think that he's a great writer, but I think he really dropped the ball on this one. I'm guessing he was partying along with all the other people in this movie and that his brain cells weren't up to the task of quality film production."

Don't waste your time watching it. I cannot believe this movie came out in theaters. Definitely doesn't deserve the 5.3 rating on IMDb! Who wrote this? A 10 year-old boy?"

Spring Break is approaching, and they are short of money for a trip down south. Korine takes an otherwise dull, predictable, and traditional topic, and makes it anything but.\n\nThere is the enormously excessive nudity, drinking, and raving- which is all sort of to be expected in a way. Korine gets it out of the way fast, assembling the pieces together like a puzzle, to let you decide if it is beautiful or not.\n\nThe setting of this film is brilliant. Florida is initially presented to us as a dreamy, bright, gaudy, tropical, neon-tinted and lively world of its own. Florida represents a dream for the four girls, where they can do anything and everything; it is their immunity. Korine glides you through fast days and faster nights on the gulf coast of St. Petersburg - all until some trouble is to be had.\n\nIn the end, the remaining girls are left devastated, alone, changed. What they had sought after was everything they experienced. They had to become different people. It is only as the girls turn back from Florida to their old lives that they realize what horrendous people they had become."

And if you are put off by that, you are not really watching because that is exactly the reason why this is a masterpiece.\n\nIt may look sloppy but not because the director didn't know how to make a movie, on the contrary. Look at those girls playing around and standing on their heads in the hallway. One of the images that is haunting me since I saw it. Strange and beautiful film making of the highest order. And this movie has a lot of those moments.\n\nBut what does it all mean? Well, I don't know if I understand it all myself. I only know if you are not willing to contemplate and philosophize this movie its wasted on you. This movie doesn't give away an easy, clear message. Not that its difficult, its just not a movie where you only sit back and relax.\n\nReading all the super negative reviews here I think that is the problem with this movie, it requires something from the viewer in order to be appreciated. Funny thing is that it is one of the messages of this movie. The compulsive effortless enjoyment people demand. Every obstacle encountered in that quest will make people irritated or even violent.\n\nIf you don't want your world to be troubled, don't watch this movie. Go watch some more Hollywood junk."

The music could have been better, but it is a new generation of kids who might relate to this or feel that this is what they want. If you really need a entertainment film and it those not need to be heavy script, this is it. Even though I say this I cannot recommend something that can be better that falls into this specific genre. A good gangster film is American gangster. No relation really, but better time spent."

Franco is fully invested and provides momentary flashes of low comedic hilarity while also imbuing the character of Alien with well considered touches of pathetic interest. Still, the film as a whole is slight- entertaining but insubstantial, energetic but flabby and the slick surface camouflages the stolid morality of this music video cum generational commentary. Korine's bravado ensures the experience won't feel like a waste (particularly in a well executed robbery in the films first third) but it isn't enough to warrant a full recommendation.

The movie was unfocused, anticlimactic, cheesy ( and not in the good way) and was just a total mess and a waste of time. Thank god I did not pay to see it.\n\nIf the directing \"style\" of this movie is considered artistic, then wow art really is dying. The best way I can describe it is basically a 90 minute long trailer. A bunch of random scenes spliced together with character voice overs. It unforgivably jerked you along the \"plot\" without ever giving explanation or justification for any of the characters actions. After watching the movie, I still have no idea what exactly happened and furthermore, do not care to figure it out. The truth is, the actors while shooting the movie probably had no idea it was going to end up the way it did. Before editing, the movie probably had a good, but small, chance of being mediocre at best. But wow, that movie was a heaping pile of crap. It came of as amateurish and very shallow, while trying way to hard to be relevant and introspective."

The trailer used a few key shots from the film to lure a very specific target audience intp believing that this is a product they want to consume: an action movie with loads of guns, dope, titties, and booze.\n\nInstead, Spring Breakers offers something even more pathetic than its actual promise : through a totally derogatory process, it gives an entire generation of viewers an overdose of all the most pathetic clich\u00e9s they've learned to worship.\n\nIt's very effective in a sense, but painful to watch, as it does nothing but expose its own rubbish emotions, characters, and questionable morals. As if this was a big joke, but purposely unfunny, awkward, and sickening. You can almost hear Korine laughing and whispering : \"Gotcha!\".\n\nSeveral people left the theatre before the credits rolled. And that's understandable with such an approach. \"Spring Breakers\" may be conceptually too hermetic in its approach to really reach out to its target audience.\n\nI don't mean to compare this film to any of the following, but if you look at \"The Truman Show\", \"Fight Club\", \"Brazil\", among many others, they managed to pass their message, criticize very precise aspects of modern society through solid narrative structures while offering a \"real\" movie experience, an actual vehicle carrying all these different thoughts and observations that the viewer may hop on.\n\n\"Spring Breakers\" lets its own emptiness carry the ball. It's innovative, without a doubt, but innovative doesn't always mean good, or watchable.\n\nThis probably had the YOLO generation go \"WTF\", to speak their language. It is a self-assumed pathetic spectacle to watch, as the viewer quickly realizes that sitting through this film offers no other option than to loathe this empty, saturated exposure of a trashy culture. It certainly feels like an experiment more than anything else.\n\nInteresting approach, unwatchable movie."

It is almost interchangable with Sofia Coppola's equally ephemeral 'bling ring'. Weightless and lacking in trash vitality, what this artsploitation number leans most heavily on is celebrity. Korine is a celebrity first and foremost and as such a crucial figure in the (just) pre-instagram phase of our Landfill culture, an exponentially expanding trash-heap of gestures, prattle, talk show appearances, etc. This review can also be added to the pile. Even being a drugs-bin is played out. This art-trash (or trash-art) epic is trash in search of a soul, never mind a body, something so tangible as a videocassette box, let alone a double-feature quad - trash without trash. Looks are everything and they are very purty, as befits it's twinkling semblance of substance. Consider: does our beloved trash of yore ooze humanity? Is Celebrity the negation or suppression of humanity? Why isn't this film more arousing?"

Often the girls are as stupid as those in a horror flick and nothing is quite believable.\n\nWhat's the great morale of this story? Don't go on spring break? Don't get drunk? An 'indictement of America.'? Please. Writer/director working with material he doesn't quite 'own' or understand. There are a couple of OK moments (the first robbery is shot in a rather clever way-- no spoilers), but why does it feel to me like the writer/director is little more than an immature male who likes to look at girls in bikinis, builds a movie around those images, and then fails to tell us a believable or interesting story.

It's Spring Break, these four girls are hot,sexy, eye-candy girls that are willing to do anything to party all day and night but, during Spring Break they end up in a nightmare of drugs and violence.Their's always repeating this phase that goes on throughout the movie and a scenes that just go on and on as well to give a message.\n\nWell right away you see a bunch of people partying out in the beach doing crazy things showing off a lot of nudity like so much of it. It makes it realistic so its believable that your seeing the world of what goes on in Spring Break. The visuals are fantastic with the neon colors seeing the locations from the beach to the streets in Florida. As for the story, it can be pretty surprising since you don't know what to expect so that's what I like about it. As for James Franco, he was over the top awesome giving out a good performance I didn't know he could do. This movie is not for everybody ,but its watchable and crazy!\n\n\"Spring Break Forever\" 8.1/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I've never seen a movie like this and I think a lot of people didn't get it because they were swept up in the sensory overload. I also believe a lot of people didn't like it because they didn't want to see anti-hero women like these - it was hard to watch these women - women who had more power than men in every way.\n\nIt was a serious art house movie that made incredibly interesting choices, not one single bit of the movie was not thought out - the cinematography and editing were amazing and the choice, the brave choice to show women such as these - and they exist - is seldom done. But if you're not careful, you'll not see it - because Korine does such an incredible job making you feel as if you are there, sensory overload - and he does this on purpose, to make you feel as the characters feel\u0085\n\nSome of my favorite parts: The repetitive dialogue and scenes - a commentary on these people's lives how they always live in the present, never move forward in their lives. The amazing visuals - underlying the surreal - just like how their lives are - \"just pretend you're in a movie\" that's how these women view life - as if nothing is real, everything is in the moment, everything is about fun and doing what you want and living a hedonistic life. The use of irony to underline how these women feel - none of it is real to them, it's all fun.\n\nI also loved the deep messages this movie had about coming of age and the paths we take and people searching for fulfillment. What was most amazing to me was that it was all wrapped up in a bubblegum teeny bopper wrapper of sex drugs and rock 'n' roll\u0085\n\nAnd because of this...\n\nI think a lot of people miss the message - they miss the commentary, they take it at face value, they miss the poetry, they miss that it was all done purpose.\n\nI thought it was amazing.\n\nI loved it."

This is not art and it was not entertaining unless you have a sick mind. The theater manager gave us a refund and agreed with me. I came to this website to see if I could figure out how it ended. I guess it ended better then I thought. Yet Iam not sorry for walking out.I know lots of movies are disturbing and at the same time could be considered art but this film from what I saw did not have it. I told my daughter she should see it to see that sometimes its better to stay home and be bored rather then get caught up in the evils of this earth, but I hope she continues to not listen to Dad and not see it but here what I said about the movie and that is it sucked."

I wish more people could appreciate the value and the beauty of this film, if they could, then I think the world would be a much better place, harmony korine you are a genius, thank you so much for making this movie. I cried in the \"everytime\" scene the second time I watched it, it was just so beautiful, I wish I could find a connection/bond with someone like that, this movie really makes me want more beauty out of life."

'Spring Breakers' gives you pretty common US entertainment: guns, bad guys, beautiful & stark naked girls, as well as a happy end. However, something positive can be said about the quality of its acting and shooting: clearly above average. Thus supporting perfectly the unique story-frame I mentioned before."

The film makers SEEM to be exposing the dark side of the American dream by highlighting the shallow sex/drugs/rock & roll underbelly of American youth. But at the same time, grossly exploit their subject matter to show sex/drugs/rock & roll. Hypocritical junk that feels like it came from the mind of a 14 year old who's parent don't give a crap. As for the basics, it's 90% music video with 10% plot. One of the most depressing movies I've ever watched. James Franco IS good playing his sleaze ball freak of a character I'll give him that. Of course the marketing dept sold the movie as this kind of Spring Break comedy. Unbelievable. They should be sued for false advertising by some consumer protection agency. And what's really sick is that the marketing for this movie definitely lured teenagers in. Which is what it is. Hopefully any teenager who did see this movie was disgusted and repulsed which is SOMETHING I suppose. From just a typical, movie going experience though, the movie is God awful. As a reviewers have commented, it's MOSTLY images flashing by with \"music\" (I use the term loosely) playing. The thrill of seeing some nubile young ladies quickly disappears in this movie and we're left for the most part watching people in their late teens early twenties getting drunk/stoned and acting gross, but again, in music video format. Now this MIGHT be titillating for the normal length of a music video...but when this comprises most of the movie...then its absurd and unless you're a 14 year old sneaking in to watch this piece of junk, your average grown up is going to say: TURN IT OFF...Put on something, ANYTHING else! But again, James Franco was very good as the sleaze ball."

        "review_detailed_main": "Multi-layered and multifaceted, Spring Breakers has achieved exactly what it set out to do - divide viewers into two teams; those who want to see through it, and those who can't - but for reasons that neither side would openly admit.\n\nHarmony Korine has presented not only his best work in this movie, but has also managed to create imagery that takes faith, nihilism, mysticism, illusion, delusion and insecurity; blending them all together to deliberately create a 'magic-eye' picture that perfectly summarises the social deadly sins, if there are such things.\n\nAt face value this is a hyper-real, glossy extended MTV video; seemingly taking a dig at music video directors for their formulaic approach and generic use of hackneyed images - girls, guns, cars, money; suggesting that as a director, he could put them to shame not just over 4 minutes, but over 90; essentially a job application. But this is merely a ruse.\n\nMake no mistake, despite being listed as Crime/Drama, this is a monster movie - but it's so well concealed beneath the gloss and social stereotypes portrayed that it easily confuses and frustrates the viewer, and this is a deliberate effort on the part of Korine: he literally flatters to deceive.\n\nOne level down from the surface, he suggests that all viewers of movies, soap operas or music videos either consciously or otherwise, aspire to the fantastical lifestyles and characters portrayed therein - and as such, are attracted to Spring Breakers for that very reason. Some, such as the characters in the movie itself go to extreme lengths to make it become reality. This is the mirror image and paradox that oft offends the viewer to the point that they simply refuse to search any further, sensing almost personal insult and questions about their own morality - as if they were watching themselves on the screen.\n\nScratch below that, and what's revealed is something terrifying, cynical, tragic and deeply religious in nature. It holds a mirror up to modern life (and the viewer) through traditional religious imagery; good and bad, right and wrong. Slowly and deliberately, it's suggested that the 'angels' are in fact 'demons' and vice versa - or at least some of them. Part of the puzzle presented by Spring Breakers, is working out who's who - or what is what - beneath their seemingly beautiful facades.\n\nBut much like an episode of The Simpsons, there is real duality here. You can view the 'kids' version without much effort or reward - or you can blur your vision, concentrate, look through the screen and watch as the 'adult' version slowly takes shape. It's all there to see: dark, light, good, evil, simple, complex - but it's up to you to decipher the puzzle, or equally, decide that there isn't one at all.\n\nFor my money, this is by far his best work to date and one of the best psychological horror movies of recent times. That's right. Horror. 8/10."

In 'Spring Breakers' he does this by\n\n1) showing the (dark) other side of young people living in a mostly religious community, who on the surface pose as devote followers of Christianity, but who on the other hand follow superficial material values and who are ready to do anything to 'get it'\n\n2) portraying the decadence of the 'Spring Break' phenomenon of which sex, drugs and partying are the main components, in strong contrast to what American parents believe their children to be\n\nThe movie is unsettling and many will be mislead by the poster, promising slick mainstream action and softcore sex. But Korine serves a dark tale and takes another serious stab at the heart of America.\n\nSurely not your average 'entertaining' action flick, but a disturbing sociological portrayal of modern America."

Whilst watching the first 30 minutes of the film, I really wanted to switch it off because of the annoying music and the stupid on the beach slow motion footage of teenagers jumping up and down, but I wanted to see what the hell James Franco had to do with the movie. Once he gets introduced, the movie veers of into crime and the characters dark world, but the film still seemed pointless. There isn't much dialogue throughout the movie and there is loads of naked bodies, but you do want the director to get on with it. James Franco's character would have been good in a totally different movie, because he is quite funny, but they tried to make the whole thing serious once the party finally stops. I honestly got fed up with the film and I didn't find it interesting at all. Pointless!\n\nRound-Up: James Franco really does take on some weird roles! On paper, I wouldn't haven't taken on this project because it was a recipe of disaster due to its weak storyline. I'm sure that there is a lot of men that will enjoy looking at naked bodies and watching people doing drugs for an hour and a half, but I don't really find it entertaining. It does make you think if there are actually places in America like this because I'm sure that there would be loads of people around the rushing to get there when they are on there Spring Break.\n\nBudget: $5million Worldwide Gross $32million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who like watching teenagers taking drugs and young girls running arid in there bikinis. 2/10"

Furthermore, i find that this movie is not worth watching as it is pointless and a waste of 90 minutes and that when you watch it you will understand the futility of this poorly directed film"

On the first sight, one would expect this to be a silly, perhaps funny and probably bad, movie about a group of 4 girls on their spring break vacation. Well, it's not. At least, not in that sense. Spring Breakers wants to be different, good and surprising, using techniques that normally would get that result, such as slow paced filming, color themed photography and supposedly profound dialogs. Well, Spring Breakers just miserably fails in every aspect. Those techniques are used, abused, almost raped, while the movie tries to make a deep portrait of what goes on on the minds of these high-schoolers. Well, yes, you could say the long slow paced shots and the strong color filters could be interpreted as the confusion that goes on these girls minds, but what?! Everything that is said is shockingly poor (even if the characters are supposed to be like that), the girls are objectified in a very non realistic way, just as the parties: we have long, boring segments of naked girls dripping vodka over their breasts in slow motion, with a pretentious alternative pop soundtrack behind, probably with a narrator girl saying something like \"This is our moment. This is the beginning of our life. This is the opportunity of finding ourselves.\", or, instead of dripping vodka on their naked body, the girls could be sniffing cocaine while a naked man asks them for oral sex (they obviously accept, because this is \"their moment\"). Oh, and don't forget to add a red or blue, maybe purple color filter to make the picture more artsy. Well, you get the idea... Spring Breakers is an offensively pretentious piece of crap, a pointless portrait of American youth that will make you walk away half way into the movie. It is so bad you will feel revolted that some people actually believe this false movie can be good. I really wished that Spring Breakers would just be a silly, perhaps funny and probably bad movie as expected..."

By the end of the movie, I only remembered two of the characters names. Twenty minutes into the movie I asked my friends when they thought the story line would begin. To this point, it is just college kids drinking and doing drugs without any character development. After an hour, I again asked the same question. At this point it was still just college kids drinking and doing drugs, but now they were yielding guns. There were a few glimpses of hope for the story line to develop, but nothing ever came of it. No real antagonist or major conflict that the characters must overcome, except for a brief five minute encounter.\n\nHands down, worst movie I've ever seen."

I think it has exaggerated some details, like certain scenes in movies. However this type of film is being used too much what has not funny and it gets tiring, it is always the same in all of them. This is not particularly large nor small story is just to distract the view ... Expected much more from this film, as the trailer seemed to be better but the movie itself is very weak ...

The film has a very critical, almost patronizing side, and then it also shows an obvious fascinated indulgence towards this overall nihilistic attitude. Seen from another perspective, It's also a caustic caricature of America, at least of the way cinema can fantasize it.\n\nSo, in the end, the director stands at the same time in and out of his subject... his intentions are totally unclear, what makes the whole film rather empty - although full of movement, colours and noise...

A letter that walks between irony and truth. We are part of a generation that prides itself to go out at night, drinking until you burst, smoking until you can't have more ... a cult of pleasure arriving at the purest hedonism. Guns, sex and trance music for the wildest spring breakers.\n\nThis short but intense and demystifying trip cleans as weeds what is good or thoughtful. Religion against drug trafficking. The world of appearances against the world of ideas. Truth vs lie. Preferring to live in the largest and most disgusting lie instead of the bittersweet life. A gin tonic that exudes eroticism and engages the eye to enjoy for an hour and a half of unbridled ecstasy and which doubts and certainly calls the viewer into question: maybe you are not always supposed to choose the right path.\n\nFurthermore, fashion actresses, a superb James Franco, dance music, drugs and partying star in a particular play which, far from looking like a rehash, proudly overlooks the wild originality. Porno-pulp, modern Russ Meyer ... that is Harmony Korine, author of this groundbreaking and powerful wild tape."

Making the trailer for this a quick, flashy video of girls in bikinis with Skrillex dubbed over it was a huge mistake.

The complete lack of any character development alone pretty much ruined any chance it may have had but if that wasn't enough the film relies way too much on the cinematography to keep us engaged. There were some absolutely gorgeous shots and tones used and it'll remain one of my favourites in terms of camera work, but cinematography, dialogue and setting should all compliment each other. One shouldn't stand out more than the others and that's where I think this film went wrong. They didn't use everything together to even out the aspects of the movie, they found what their strong point was, painted it fluorescent yellow and stuck it on a flagpole while the rest lay on the ground.\n\nDespite all of its flaws, it is still worth watching and I would recommend anybody interested in film photography to take some notes from Beno\u00eet Debie's work here."

        "review_title": "The impression when we watch \"Spring Breakers\" is that this development is all rushed and these changes convey an enormous feeling of improbability that bothers all the time",
        "review_detailed_main": "To the sound of electronic music, hundreds of young people, most in bathing suits, dance, drink, smoke and use various types of drugs on the beach. The dream of thousands of North Americans, the so-called spring break (something like \"spring break\", school recess) has already begun and is part of the current imagination of four childhood friends who, already in college, disillusioned with the responsibilities of adult life, imagine themselves in that same place, where everything is a party and nothing is forbidden. The days of celebration will change these girls' lives, each in their own way - and not always pleasantly - in \"Spring Breakers: Dangerous Girls\".\n\nThe film, directed and scripted by Harmony Korine, one of the creative minds behind \"Kids (1995)\", features names like James Franco, Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens in the cast and, as in the feature film of almost two decades ago, deals with of the disillusionment of teenagers and new adults in contemporary society, where the pleasure of \"now\", even if inexhaustible, seems to be more important than the question: \"after all, what do I want for my life?\". In order to quench the desire to be surrounded by other \"equals\", so to speak, the girls wear hoods and rob people to get money for the party. Little do they know that things are only going to get worse - even if they don't realize it.\n\nThe only one in the group who seems to have a rationality greater than the will to live is Faith (Selena Gomez), who, not by chance, participates in a youth group at the church. Incidentally, it is Catholic guilt that makes the girl stop and measure the acts and consequences of the trip. On the other hand, her partners extrapolate and, in one of these, they all end up in prison. The rapper Alien (James Franco) is the one who delivers them from there, a gangster and drug dealer who falls in love with the girls and becomes their protector. It is at this moment that \"Spring Breakers\", if it wasn't already light, steps deep into the group's immersion in an underworld to which they do not belong - however, it is what they most want to live, far from their reality. Even with the departure of one of them, the remaining three become not only Alien's lovers, but their partners in crimes and pleasures of all kinds. Something that won't end well.\n\nHarmony Korine has unfortunately chosen an inappropriate approach here. Moved by several temporal digressions (small flashbacks and flashforwards that seem to appear randomly), the film is also charged by a reflective narration whose repetition simply hammers home the obvious: \"This place is paradise, I never want to leave\" or \"It wasn't to be like this, it was not to be like this\", repeats several times to Faith by Selena Gomez. The director bets on more concrete sequences and focused on dialogue, especially with the entry of James Franco in the projection. With braided hair, silver teeth and endless \"y'all\" (the excess of which already appears as a way for the character to try to \"compensate\" for his ethnicity) on the tip of his tongue, Franco's Alien is already one of the most memorable figures of his promising career; being able to perfectly combine his comic persona with a tenuous dramatic line. The main quartet does competently well, but it is undeniable that their exposed bodies (and not the strength of their not very well-defined performances) are the central factor. Spring Breakers even tries to use its young figures to promote some social commentary (no wonder Faith, faith, is the first to express regrets), but nothing strong enough to justify its inclusion. Maybe if Korine bet on the old formula of \"good things go wrong\", the result would be more satisfactory. In times of increasingly rare originality in cinema, it even seems contradictory to say that a film would do better if it opted for the conventional, but... that's what happens here.\n\nBut not everything is bad in production. Beno\u00eet Debie's photography is never gratuitous, always investing in visual clues about what will happen next. In the classroom seen at the beginning of the projection, appropriately dipped in shadows, we see the neon/citric tones that refer to Spring Break. Correct in composing the college as an environment where gray drained all the colors (something that would be repeated in prison, after the party), Debie underscores even more the fascination that the unruly celebration exerts on young women, which the filmmakers infantilize through details subtle things like teddy bear bags and sweet lines (\"this is our chance to see something different\"). The film still finds time to create unexpected metaphors, as in the scene where the girls bathe in a fountain, in a pathetic attempt at purification to enter body and soul into the celebration, at the same time that strong red lights denounce the danger and the guilt inherent in their activities, in a moment that playfully flirts with the visual logic of \"Goodfellas\".\n\nNot falling into the common error of justifying or relativizing Alien's illegal activities, Franco's script and performance transform him into nothing less than a dangerous, frightening and absolutely fragile character. Owner of a sensitivity that no one would expect from a figure like him, the gangster-drug dealer makes reference to the iconic \"Scarface\" with the same ease with which, in a beautiful scene (and without fear of being corny), he sings the song \"Every time\", by Britney Spears. This moment represents Brit (Benson), Candy (Hudgens) and Cotty (Korine) coming of age in the criminal world, rhyming perfectly with the scene where another song by the same artist is sung, the silly \"Baby One More Time\" . But some situations are difficult to accept, sounding implausible, even in that totally distorted universe. The script never bothers to clarify, for example, the real reason for Alien to pay the girls' bail, since he had never seen them before (and countless other girls were in the same situation).\n\nThe parallel between spring break, the Christian paradise, and the American dream is repeated countless times, by the most diverse voices that make up the mosaic of the film. They are the images of fullness in a \"pop poem\", to quote the director's expression, in a framework created by the mass cultural industry and its faithful ally, advertising, which populates the imagination of young people and indicates them as an ideal model of what they must aspire to be and to live. In this sense, despite not being a priori a gangster film, like Hawks' Camonte, the girls of \"Spring Breakers\" unscrupulously go beyond any norm of morality to realize the great dream injected, unveiled, pointed out to them, a dream elaborated by the whole wide advertising fabric under which they were brought up. Their path could repeat the final motto of eighty years ago: \"the world is all yours\".\n\nIn this rich interweaving, Korine manages, with great skill, to unite two trajectories that would be essentially opposite: on the one hand, the sinful one, which involves robberies, nudity, alcoholism, drugs, and many other profane forms; on the other hand, the sacred, which involves the search for religious experience. The girls leave the quiet town where they only see immobility to try to find that idyllic paradise where things make sense, where they feel alive. It is at the same time a journey of Balzacian decadence of the man from the interior in the big city, but also a migratory saga of a people towards the sacred land. And, strictly speaking, we are facing the same saga, because advertising, the cultural industry, capitalism, and ultimately, the American and Protestant spirit would have engendered this strange paradox. The gesture spreads throughout the work. Images of buttocks wiggling, women taking off their bras and guys snorting cocaine are accompanied by the voice over of Faith (Selena Gomes) on a phone call, telling her grandmother how she found nice people and is experiencing great, unforgettable moments in a place were found and wanted to live forever. Rapper Alien discovers how genuine his love for girls is when they put gun barrels in his mouth and make him suck on them. But to the word or thought of the sacred, the image of the profane is added (and is there anything more reformist?).\n\nHarmony's work in directing and, especially, in the script, can cause a certain strangeness to those who are used to more conventional accounts of disillusioned young people. However, here, glamor gives way to a journey from heaven to hell, and the captured images, as well as the off-screen narrative of the characters, displaced (or not) from what appears on screen, give the impression that the spectator is under the effect of hard drugs. It may not seem like it, but everything is connected, just the montage that plays with the (lack of) linearity refers to what seems to be the mental state of the young women. There is the initial and constant confusion, but in the end, it fits perfectly with the speech. This is not to say that the film seems confusing and appealing most of the time to most people, full of girls going topless, being on drugs all the time and in a matter of days going from girls disillusioned and sad about the world they live in. To get involved with a drug dealer who takes them out of jail without even knowing them and even become murderers later... The impression is that this development is all rushed and these changes convey an enormous feeling of improbability that bothers them at all times. There isn't a single moment when we don't think that the film's protagonists are unable to maintain a more reflective conversation with each other for even a moment, as they are busy being drunk or drugged to \"free themselves\" from the \"oppressive\" world in which they live. It's the old story of wanting to be free from people who are not even a little mature and who do the greatest atrocities to justify that they do it in search of such \"freedom\"."

Notice I didn't say 'girls'. It's boys and girls. If you look at the breadth of his work there's an underlying theme of innocence juxtaposed with sex. I don't find this offensive, although some will. I do however, find it hard to watch at times. And when I watch his movies every single one i have a visceral reaction. I think that's the point. Korine aims to make you uncomfortable, to show you the private lives of the everyday people you see.. Now yeah, spring breakers is a gangster movie and no, i don't think my 14 yo neighbor is playing with guns. But i think this is what he's doing. Some of this is real life for people; its gritty and unbelievable and goes against all that stuff your momma taught you. And he does it so well. He presents you with something sweet and innocent, then slowly shows you truth. God i love that.\n\nI am also quite happy with his portrayal of the south FL spring break culture. I was born and raised in Clearwater...this stuff in the movie was no joke. The drugs/sex/dancing/cars/strip clubs, that's all a real south FL thing. It's not a party year round, but you can bet from March-April things get nuts (between west FL beaches and Miami's Ultra fest, you do the math).\n\nI was quite impressed with Gomez and Hudgens breaking away from Disney with a movie that is in such stark contrast from what they came from. Franco never disappoints. Just watch it, try it. It's not for everyone. In fact I think a lot of people would miss the point. But I really love the rawness that Korine brings to filmmaking and this was one of his best."

I'm not sure why I kept watching I guess I did in hopes that at some point something would happen, finally it looked like something would and they cut to the aftermath of it, it's just one long drawn out movie of horrible dialogue.

Well, most white girls from across the nation who go on spring break are usually NOT put in the scenario surrounded by black guys in some remote shack, let alone black \"gansta's.\" She, and we, knew they were because of Jame's connections or environs. IT. WAS. REAL. Harmony nailed this. It was ART. 3) The redundant dialog and imagery. Again:it's REAL, and it is ART. As humans, we think the same matters over and over in our minds. Regardless of our situations in life, we judge, doubt and question, the same things repeatedly. ITS REAL and it's FINE art. When it's done just right--as Harmony did, we get amazing results. Redundancy IS art, just as the repetitive music from Star Wars IS Amazing (thank you John Williams) and so is Les Miserables (thank you Boubil, Schonberg, Kretzmer, and Natel) and some others, including AMAZING and brilliant popular songs by Zeppelin, Metallica, Earth Wind and Fire, Sade, Beatles, Stevie Wonder, and many more, and ALL THOSE masterpieces we know as Classical Music.\n\nAll the actors fulfilled their roles without a hair-thin flaw. JAMES FRANCO. Seeing the nominations and winners of this past \"awards season,\" JAMES DESERVES ALL THE ACTING AWARDS come next year! Lawrence winning all those awards was a H...U...G...E error, and it was a raping of dignity and honor. If she won those awards, THEN JAMES DESERVES THE NOBEL AND PULITZER. He has not done anything near as amazing as his \"Alien.\" Selena and Vanessa did easily better than what Lawrence did in Silver..."

It's as if the entire film was improvised and shot on someone's phone. The scarce, rambling dialogue is nothing but clunky exposition that barely manages to drag the story forward, while doing nothing to build the loathsome one dimensional characters. Poor James Franco is the only redeemable feature about this film, and does his best with what little script he's given. But the filmmakers lame excuse for social commentary on contemporary American youth falls short of the artistic merit they were reaching for. It's basically a vehicle for ex Disney girls attempting to transition their careers to an adult demographic by exploiting every trick in the book -pointless glorification of drugs, violence, and nudity. Not that there's anything wrong with that.\n\nI can't in good conscience recommend this film to anyone. If it was offered as in-flight entertainment, I would kick out the window in the hope that I would be sucked out of the plane and spared the agony of sitting through it again."

        "review_detailed_main": "I just came out of this one and I think I'm in love. Before I write about the film, let me say that I went into this film with no expectations. I didn't know if it'd be funny or weird or mainstream or uncomfortable. As a fan of Harmony Korine, I know what he is and is capable of, I know he's a joker, but I know he's also a unique person who follows his vision to its end, whatever it may be, but you can never tell if you're going to get something you'll like. He gives you images and leaves you with thoughts. You don't have to think too much during his movies \u2014 he doesn't much either, so I doubt it having much subtext \u2014 but that doesn't mean there isn't something worth talking about when they're over. You may feel it's a little, or it may feel like a little, but if you can appreciate what he's trying to depict, there will always be life to talk about once a film of his concludes.\n\nWhen I said you don't have to think much during the films of Harmony Korine, that is not to say you should not think about them afterward. If you've shown given him your time and patience and watch the film to its ultimate conclusion, I doubt anyone can say they didn't like or take something away from it. James Franco's performance seems pretty revered \u2013 I would call it amazing. Some sequences will stick with you \u2014 Korine himself says he doesn't really remember the plots of all the movies he's loved, instead sequences or scenes \u2014 like Britney Spears' \"Everytime\". Okay, I was in a theater of five \u2014 three of them left, one of them during that segment. But if you sit through it all you're certainly not going to forget it! And if you leave, well, you're certainly not going to forget it, but you will resent it for the time and money it took, but that's silly, don't resent that stuff. Just enjoy the movie you see.\n\nThe film could be divided into halves \u2013 the first being the prelude to Spring Break and Spring Break and the second with James Franco. During the film, and it's awful to think like this during movies because it only distracts you from the movie, I thought to myself \"The direction is kind of shapeless, the juxtapositions could be sharper, but it does have edge and the repetition is effective, it's vivid and it's making me sick,\" in a good way. That could be how I could summarize the film for someone, if they wanted, but the direction finds itself in the end. Otherwise those words can be my basis of thought for this movie, which is an otherwise unique movie-going experience.\n\nAs I write and think more about the film (I just got back) its nonstop audio/visual indulgence is so effective. Spring Breakers is a film that is very telling for this generation, if a little insane with its concept. \"Just do it like a video game :: This is paradise :: Spring break forever ya'll\" things people today feel like. And of course, the repetition is done to unforgettable effect, but especially the line \"You're scared, aren't ya? Scaredy cat\" toward the end. Mmm\u0085 this is good cinema.\n\nI guess what I wrote was too long to be put here, but I thought James Franco was simply amazing in his role and go into further detail about that here: https://forizzer69.wordpress.com/\n\nBoy was he amazing."

I had nothing to do with it. You were too dumb to understand the point it was making. Yes, there was an idiot involved in the screening of the movie you saw, but it definitely wasn't any of the people who made the movie.\n\nSatire, people. Look it up. Using the very tools and methods of the bankrupt, Girls Gone Wild, party at any cost culture to expose the utter blankness and uselessness of it. That's what this movie was all about.\n\nI will admit it. The filmmakers, or, at least, the film's marketers, more likely, did not play fair with you. They tricked you into going to see it because you thought it was a straight-ahead Spring Break debauchery fest (sorry to try and read your minds, but that's what I am forced to infer from your disappointed comments). Perhaps it was a bad idea, conning you into looking into a mirror where you would see a void staring back at you. The odds that you would get that, that you would reach that epiphany were quite small indeed. The audience most receptive to this film's message were the ones least in need of its powers of persuasion. The audience least receptive to its points were those least likely to understand them.\n\nAh, well. Fun to look at, and lots of cool music. I supposed that in the end, self-examination was something that should not have been fairly expected from most of the viewers of this film."

I felt like the movie never really got started because of the constant narrating. People thought that because Gomez was in it, that the movie would revolve around her, but it didn't because it wasn't about her! It was about all of them not just one girl. Franco's performance didn't disappoint me, i thought he was excellent, if the movie had been about the relationship between Alien(Franco) and Archie(Gucci) and their personal rivalry, it would have been a whole different film. Now i wish it would have been, because i thought those scenes were great, but because the movie tried to focus more on what was going on with the girls thats what made it a let down for the audience."

This movie will challenge you and will burrow into your head for days. The more I think about it, the better the movie gets. Totally subverts your expectation of not only being a simple movie about spring break with chicks in bikinis but also what would occur in such a crime movie.\n\nJames Franco gives a revelatory experience, just completely transformed. The girls also are surprisingly good for newcomers to such a type of movie.\n\nExuded that coolness like Drive, with the mostly midnight neo-noir feel. Korine's naturalistic eye of taking you to another world far from normality (Gummo) worked wonders here. The sunny and dreamy landscape of Florida is right up in your face. Ride that hedonistic neon nightmare or get the **** off.\n\nSex and violence go hand in hand as they do here, exemplified by the silencer scene. The movie's half-cocked for a while much like Drive. It carries that Chekhov's Gun for a long time until violence occurs. Brilliant pacing and a great exercise in juxtaposition such as the Britney Spears montage thanks to the fantastic editing.\n\nLoved how it had two main protagonists with Selena Gomez and James Franco, and how their characters had fairly similar philosophies of wanting to live in the moment forever even if they're on completely opposite sides on the morality spectrum.\n\nDelicious cinematography, had one memorable long tracking shot of a robbery all from the outside looking in from the getaway car. The Malick comparisons are apt with the spoken word-like narration, flash-forwards and flashbacks, philosophizing, and ethereal camera. Some of the ethereal electronic score reminded me of Solaris, and lo and behold it was the same composer (Cliff Martinez, who also did Drive)."

The choppy scenes were mainly fillers that appealed to the male audience because they mainly consisted of topless women. Although the soundtrack fits well with today's generation I do not believe Spring Breakers will become a classic because the entire basic style of this movie will fade in a matter of a few years and apply to no one attempting to fit through this motion picture a few years down the line.

I really am looking forward to walking into the theaters on March 22 to watch it again with my friends. Finally we have film that shows of the mature acting of Vanessa and Selena, mainly Selena. Selena has been receiving a lot of hate for being in the movie. Which she wasn't fully even in her character Faith left before getting down and dirty. I saw nothing wrong with any of the actresses. There characters are in college, going some where for Spring Break,which there characters never got to do. Of course there gonna go crazy. But thats just the first half, the second half gets more violent and sexual, which worked. Ashely and Vanessa had great chemistry together. They were professional the entire time. Rachel as far as Im concerned shes related to the director I think his wife. Plus her character after the actual Spring Break portion shes kinda forgettable. But I do say watch the movie if your looking for something good. I mean it entertained me and my friends way, way, way more then Avatar (The so-called number 1 movie of all time). Must see."

I SMELL NICE!\"\n\nSpring Breakers begins with its colorful neon lights, its catchy score, and its hallucinatory hedonistic atmosphere in such a way that it draws the audience in from the very beginning. There is no character development whatsoever or an interesting plot, but there was something magnetic about this social commentary on today's youth and search for pleasure. Spring Breakers was written and directed by Harmony Korine, and at first I was really drawn in to this film that had a very unique mood and energy to it. The music and the slow motion allowed for Korine's social commentary to get across pretty easily. But as the film progressed and continued to be repetitive (there are literally several scenes and voice-over narrations that play over and over again) I felt like I was getting more and more irritated with it. By the end it got so repetitive that I felt like I was watching the same music video on repeat several times. Even at the short length of 90 minutes this movie felt too stretched out. This could have worked as a short film, but instead Korine decided to stretch it out in order to get his point across. He focused so much on the hedonistic and immoral side of today's youth that I just felt overwhelmed by this movie. What began as a provocative film slowly began to lose itself into a fluorescent nightmarish dream. I understand that the one dimensional characters were actually intended, but the plot could've used a little more work and less repetition. I preferred Coppola's The Bling Ring, which I felt worked as a better social commentary about today's celebrity and fashion obsessed youth. In Spring Breakers, Korine focuses on this generation's hedonistic search for pleasures such as sex, alcohol, drugs, and violence. Finding one's identity seems to be related with having fun and searching for as much pleasure as one can find. Korine got his point across, but he seemed to be repeating himself too much. At the end it just felt too preachy.\n\nFaith (Selena Gomez), Candy (Vanessa Hudgens), Brit (Ashley Benson), and Cotty (Rachel Korine) have been best friends since they were in grade school. Now they are all studying at the same University and they are looking forward to spending time together during Spring break. They are planning on going to Florida to have a good time and discover themselves. They talk about this event as if it were going to be some sort of spiritual experience and self discovery, but in reality all they are looking for is to party. The only problem is that they never come up with the money to travel. Candy, Brit, and Cotty all have similar character traits, they are very outgoing party girls. Faith on the other hand is a little more reserved as she has a Christian background and likes to go to church and prayer groups. The three troublemakers decide to rob a local restaurant in order to come up with the money for their trip. With only a couple of water guns they succeed and are all set for their adventure. Faith joins the girls and together they begin having the time of their life in Florida. But the fun and games don't last too long after they experience some trouble with the law and end up behind bars. A stranger, a gangster rapper named Alien (James Franco), bails them out and invites them to hang out with him. He has some interesting plans for these special girls.\n\nThe film has some very interesting performances here, but the stand out without a doubt has to be James Franco. He plays a very different character from the ones we are used to seeing from him. Despite how much I enjoyed his performance, I still think you could enjoy it from the trailers alone because there isn't much more in the film. Some scenes actually felt like if it were the trailer repeating itself over and over. Selena Gomez also gives a very different performance from her Disney roles as we see her smoking and drinking, although she is a little more reserved then the rest of the girls. The other three girls are very hard to distinguish in this film. They all play similar roles and it was as if director Korine was purposely mushing the three characters into one. They were all hungry for adventure and all they were looking for was to experience as much pleasure as they could having no morals at all. When James Franco comes into play at first we see him as this dangerous figure for the girls, but soon we realize that he might be in for a surprise. I had no problem with the performances here, I enjoyed them. My main issue had to do with the fact that the movie had no plot and it continued to repeat itself over and over. The magnetic appeal it had at the beginning slowly went wearing off on me until I could care less for what was happening."

This movie is done up by a college film student who is on the 5 year plan.If your looking for a message go to western union this movie just doesn't have a solid one .At least one that uncovers something we didn't already know about the youthes of today."

It made this generation appear crazy if it even gave any insight to the generation at all. What drew me into the movie originally were the actresses & how well known they are for previous roles which makes the movie seem appealing. It made their acting look crappy because of how bad the movie was. The only reason I fully watched the movie was to see if anything came together or there was some form of redemption but there wasn't & it left you still confused. How anyone considers this a good movie is beyond me & a 4/10 is a generous rating."

        "review_detailed_main": "(Not Recommended) Oh, those child stars that want to drastically change their clean-cut images! This latest act of desperation comes in the form of a dirty little movie called Spring Breakers. Written and directed by Harmony Korine and starring Disney Channel favorites, Vanessa Hudgens and Selena Gomez, the film is a cautionary tale without much caution. More exploitation movie than serious drama, Spring Breakers tells the story of four college girls gone wild. (The other two roles played by actresses Ashley Benson and Rachel Korine, wife of the filmmaker.) These party girls, named Candy, Faith, Brit, and Cotty, meet Alien, a gun- totting rapper and drug dealer, played by James Franco. This is spring break after all. So crimes are committed, sex and drugs run rampant, and morals are corrupted. It's Where the Boys Are 2013.\n\nOverusing hand held cameras to give Spring Breakers a cinema verite realistic style works to the film's advantage and the director does have a unique  vision but he is in dire need of  toning down his excessiveness and need to shock his audience. Too much time is spent on atmosphere and flashy editing with little concentration on character development and plot structure. The dialog is practically non existent and some scenes border on self parody, especially an unfortunate and unintentionally laughable musical serenade with pink ski masks and guns as a slow motion ballet set to Britney Spear's Everything.\n\nHowever, the film is worth seeing for its vivid photography by Beno\u00eet Debie, an effective electronic music score by Cliff Martinez and Skrillex, and a nearly unrecognizable Franco, the only actor here to actually give a performance. Franco is all gold teeth, cornrows, and false bravado. He leaves a strong impression as a hedonistic gangster, but then who couldn't, as he gives fellatio to a semiautomatic weapon in one scene alone. It's far from nuanced, but at least he's sincere.\n\nSpring Breakers may become a cult classic to some, but it's all surface treatment and as shallow as its interchangeable one dimensional characters. The film seems more interested in titillation than explanation. For me, after seeing these repulsive and unlikeable characters for nearly two hours of endless lust and debauchery, I needed to take a well-earned break from this uglier side of life.

Harmony Korine's movie is a strange one, combining a celebratory hedonism, a tale of people disconnected from moral society reminiscent of 'A Clockwork Orange' or 'Natural Born Killers', and in places, an elegiac mood of fractured innocence. If you wonder how these elements can co-exist, the answer is that Korine almost pulls it off through a unique but stylised presentation in which his heroines' trip down south appears more as dream than reality; but in truth, there's not really much substance holding the film together. The end result is an interesting failure, that hints at something real and disturbing between its near-pornographic surface, but can't really do much more than hint."

No WAY I will see that.\" But then I read the great reviews and started really wanting to see it. I didn't have high expectations and maybe that helped a little; but I have to say I really liked this film. And not in a \"happy-go-lucky\" Disney kind of way. It was VERY disturbing. But just like \"Winter's Bone\" it made it's point and it did it well. It's intuitive that a lot of people complain about seeing movies that portray teens who have dialogue that is very grown-up and not 'teen- like' at all; but then a movie comes along like this one where the teens are just as annoyingly vapid-sounding as they are in real life and they complain that it is boring. It IS annoying in a way; but it's REAL. That's the point. And even though their vernacular is teen-like; their actions show their morality and their true selves.\n\nGirls have it rough nowadays and they are more lost than ever. Media shows us how much of 'have-not's' they are by comparison; and parents don't pay much attention because they are divorced and working and, mostly, because they are a part of a generation who had it SO much easier in terms of the economy and the right paths to follow. The Baby-Boomer parents are the \"Me-Generation\" and are not in touch with this post- sexual revolution/divorced parents/drug-addled/internet culture that their children are a part of. I think this movie made a bold statement about the current generation of lost children who are coming into a world where they are not welcomed by a fair job market and where they have to compete for any tiny scrap of power and self-dignity they will ever get. Do these kids really KNOW how to gain actual self-worth? No. And that is the point of this movie. It's a sadness at the end but it's a cautionary tale. And a DAMN good one."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's written and directed by Harmony Korine. I personally hadn't watched any of his works, so I wasn't familiar with his style but I still wanted to like this movie because of James Franco's attempt of a very new and different role. However, I ended up with total disappointment.\n\nI start with the bright side and then start bitching about the problems. The cinematography is done well here, a lot of beautiful wide shots of the ocean, sky, and sunset. The performances are also fairly fine, I don't have complains about the actors performances. The soundtrack is not bad, very trippy; although at some point it is shitty in my opinion because I hate Dubstep. I'm assuming another positive point for some guys would be the amount of the nudity in this movie.\n\nI personally never have understood the point of an excitement for a week of a spring break when there's a 14-16weeks of summer break not too far away from it. However, before watching it I totally ignored my personal judgment, but the story, script, and directing are just so poor and boring that it drives me insane. I'm not a religious person but the amount of nudity is just so unnecessary. Yes, it's about spring break and it's supposed to be like that but when the director is trying to have an artsy tone, it doesn't work, in fact it becomes so boring that I don't think any straight man get a boner. The music is trippy on these party scenes with the poorest and most annoying narrations, then music becomes dubstep or whatever that's not enjoyable. I also don't understand some of these poor handy cam footages, does it supposed to make it feel more authentic? If so, why is it in poor quality? It's not happening in 90's, and in fact some people are recording with smart phones, why not using those footages then? Again, so many useless scenes, or I guess they should be call it \"eye candy\" shots or scenes that have no purpose in forwarding the story. The story absolutely has no point what so ever. The dialogues are even worse, you wouldn't care what they say or narrate, and it's so repetitive that they get annoying. The ending is just the poorest part of the movie where it proves that this was absolutely a pointless movie. Some might say the point is to do what you want to do that makes you happy, in that case I'd respond bullshit! Because some of the characters doesn't end up having that resolution, plus the ending is just directed so poorly that it disapproves with all of that. I don't know why I'm being genuine for not spoiling it at all, but I can tell you it's written so awfully that I could write a book and bitch all about it.\n\nTherefore, I highly DO NOT recommend this film, if you want to watch some artsy film with a great story and characters, watch Drive, watch Mud, watch Oldboy, watch The Place Beyond The Pines watch Brick, you watch anything else but not this! I feel like being generous for giving it 5/10."

The actual style of the film itself shows that it's trying to do something else, Harmony Karine sets an atmosphere where the same phrases are repeated several times \"Spring Break, Spring Break Forever\" and of silence, to make it almost awkward really emphasizing how crazy the whole idea of spring break is. I really do think this film is worth watching on both sides, as a film that will leave you thinking and a film that is entertaining as a action/comedy (not laugh out loud though).\n\n(no thanks i quit pls)"

Even when you get bad reviews like these i would still say that you need to watch it for yourself since there are clearly people that like the movie and you could be one of them. I for one am not one of them.\n\nFirst off the movie starts out with boobs and buts and some skrillex music. The movie stars bad actresses and Selena Gomez who doesn't fit in the movie at all. It's just an attempt to come off as a bad girl instead of the nickelodeon girl that she got branded. The movie has some nice colors but overall the scenes are just there and completely random. there are just random scenes without any story. THERE IS NO STORY. I read that people say the we (we being people disliking the movie) just don't get the underlying messages, but guess what, why should we? A movie should be judged (in my opinion) on it's entertaining value and the emotions that the movie gives you. This movie was awful and it was painful to watch\n\n\n\nJames De Franco put down a legendary scene of lines such as YALL and LOOK AT MY SHIIIEETT which has become famous on the internet.\n\nI went into this movie with low expectations and those expectations were not low enough since it was just painful to watch, especially that gun blow job scene which was very painful to watch indeed and the Britney spears singing scene which hurt my ears!"

This was weird conflict and the script was also weird. The characters were extremely annoying. I was annoyed. When the movie ended I ran out. Bottom line: annoying characters, no plot, no theme, meaningless ending. But I like the music so I'll add a vote. I also liked the style of directing so I'll add another vote."

        "review_detailed_main": "If ever there was a film that I was destined to loathe, it would be this. Women partying in skimpy bikinis, devouring alcoholic beverages, sniffing lines of white powder and James Franco gone, what I like to call, \"Full Franco\". And unsurprisingly the above criticisms are included in Korine's divisive crime caper, but for everything he executed incorrectly, he somehow combated through sensory visuals that narratively took hold of the thin story. A group of young girls attended spring break in Florida where they encounter a local drug dealer who spirals their lives into the descending world of drugs and violence.\n\nImmediately, the film commences with a montage of flesh. Half-naked teenagers are having a gay ol' time at a beach, drinking their sorrows away whilst the pounding beats of Skrillex' dubstep causes sensory overload. When the torture ended and my ears re-adjusted, Korine takes the direction through a fascinating receptive tunnel that strangely entranced me.\n\nAcquiring Debie's gorgeously vibrant cinematography and Martinez' minimalistic score, he controversially turns a seemingly buoyant party extravaganza into an artistic reflection of modern superficiality, presenting the tainted American dream in all its vulnerability. The self-destruction of today's youth proving far more visceral than your average spring break getaway. This is where Korine truly inhabits the contemporary aesthetic, with stunning tracking shots, particularly the restaurant robbery, taking hold of the narrative. The use of visual storytelling worked wonders, particularly when the female-led cast is less than impressive. Gomez singing a Spice Girls song is the extent of her \"acting\" ability.\n\nHowever Korine distracts us with Crise's ornate use of editing techniques. Consistently jumping forward for one second, then cutting back to a previous scene, made for a hallucinogenic experience that felt both erratic and sensational. The minimal narrative content, whilst provided an entrancing experience, acted as a broken beer bottle. Forcing me to yearn for some character backstory just to cling onto an ounce of relatable investment. Unfortunately, the chaotic lighting didn't provide much character depth, merely limiting this experience to a superficial shell rather than an intrinsic perspective.\n\nHowever my main annoyance was the constant objectification of females and how they were likened to \"play things\" for wealthy men. The portrayal of women was absurdly animalistic, with various scenes comprising of girl-on-girl action, crotch shots and enough buttocks meat to start a local butchers. Yet with no real purpose other than to remind us that we're watching a spring break party. Was there any need to constantly keep submerging the camera, that's floating on a pool, to focus on thighs and skimpy bikinis? It doesn't anything other that more objectification. Not even Franco choking on, not one but two, firearm suppressors was enough to invalidate the male superiority. \"Good girls gone bad\"? Not exactly, let's be honest.\n\nI cannot dispute the fact that this is an interesting conversational piece, both thematically and through its execution. Quite rightly so, it's one of the most divisive films of the modern age, to which I acknowledge both juxtaposing viewpoints. I'd lean slightly closer to the positive side, yet so many aspects didn't sit right with me leaving me smack bang in the middle. Not the euphoric experience it thinks it is, but certainly won't be causing any hangovers either."

It's basically about four girls who go to Florida for Spring Break, but a lot of illegal stuff happens along the way... and it's one of Franco's best roles on top of that.\n\nIf I had to guess what kind of people would enjoy this film most, I would say young people. Parents, let this be a warning and an added layer of awareness... or a fun ride down your own memory lane.\n\nWatch it and be pleased. Oh, and don't be like most of the IMDB raters who couldn't handle the truth that was unfolding on screen, and probably opted to turning it off... this is one of those films were you can't judge it by its rating."

This could make sense in the context of exposing the world of these teenagers, where everything is shallow and superficial, but it gets tiring quite fast and as a result makes for a rather dull watching experience.\n\nStill, it's trying to be different - and that applies to the visuals and the overall, flirting with the absurd, vibe as well - and it deserves some credit for that."

What annoyed me most about this movie is that it had very little dialog and most of the lines were repeated over and over again like a broken record. Some of the stunt the girls pulled were not very realist either and would have got them put in prison or dead in the real world. If Selena, Vanessa, or Ashley is your favorite actress or you just like the T&A then you might be able to tolerate all the artsy crap and stupidity. Out of the hour and twenty-seven minute of this movie there is only about fifteen minutes of somewhat decent dialog. So rent it for the T&A but don't expect much from the lines, acting, plot, etc."

This movie revolves around the drug and crime problems in the world today. Using different filming techniques, fading in ad out, using pinkish tint in scenes, created a film that you could not look away from. Using past Disney and ABC family stars, Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens, this movie intrigues the viewer even more. These, once innocent Disney stars, take on a role of drugs and crime. These girls use tremendous skill, making the viewer believe that this may actually be happening. Then, James Franco comes into play in a role like no other. We see this transformed James Franco as a drug and gun dealer with loads of cash. He, with his cornrows, full grill, and tattoos, build a character that enhances the film and catches our attention even more. This movie is unlike any other film that I have ever seen, and I say this in a great way. This movie will keep you reeled in the entire time, feeling for the characters and the situation the whole movie. This may be a lower budget film, but the aftermath of this film is amazing. However, do not bring small children to this movie, as there is many very inappropriate scenes. This movie boosted the careers of these young stars, and this is a movie that nobody should miss!"

        "review_detailed_main": "My childhood of watching Vanessa Hudgens' Disney movies & shows will never be the same. OK, so there is a blatant lie in that last sentence; not all the acting that Vanessa did as a child was Disney; blink, blink. Nevertheless, Se\u00f1or Walt Disney is probably rolling in his grave in reacting to Hudgens' looking incredibly sultry and adulterated in Writer-Director Harmony Korine's \"Spring Breakers\". This movie is not a formulaic t*tty tale of college students jumanjing to the hot spots of spring break partying to unleash their wild side alongside their partners in spring break crime- Jack Daniels, Johnny Walker, Jose Cuervo, Bud Lite, and let's not forgot the rubbery one, Mr. Trojan (he does not have a first name). Instead, Korine has presented us stunning visuals and an inventive semi non-linear narrative in \"Spring Breakers\". The movie features four longtime female friends all around 19 or 20 years old, and I must mention very attractive (hey, I am a guy, what did you expect?) who are craving for the fun in the sun time that is spring break on the beaches of St. Petersburg, Florida. Ashley Benson and Hudgens play Candy & Brit, the college devilish hotties who are fed up with their mundane university education, and are in need of a desperate break from the books. Rachel Korine is Kotty, the most sexually-loose one of the group (even though it's a \"not so tight\" I mean \"tight\" race for that designation) who alongside Candy & Brit is trying to wrestle up some coin for the spring break sexscapade, I mean escapade. And to wrap up the eye-candy quartet, there is Faith played by Selena Gomez; cause I gotta have faith, faith, faith, I gotta have faith; well, I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body\u0085..; sorry the George Michaelnotsoangelo in me got a bit carried away. Anyways, Faith is the religious one (sense her name) who decides to lead herself into temptation by partnering up with her rebellious gal pals into the spring break partying tsunami. The big problem for the gals is that they don't have enough money to go on the trip, so they decide to knock off a chicken restaurant for their spring break budget. After some hard partying in the St. Petersburg party valley, they get arrested in a police raid, and end up in the can with their bikinis on throughout the whole time. How come I never saw that in my field trips to county jails as a kid? Anyways, much to their surprise they get bailed out by Alien (no not the thing that comes out of John Hurt and Noomi Rapace's stomachs). Alien is a drug-dealing gangster who moonlights as an aspiring hip-hop artist. Alien is as wicked and gangster as they come, and also has ulterior motives in why he bails out the Foxtastic Four. James Franco's performance as Alien is, what's the phrase? O yea, far out!!! It is a show-stopping performance that reinforces what a diversified talent Franco is. Hudgens and Gomez might have caused a Disney uproar with their seductive personas in \"Spring Break\", but in the end, it's not a small world after all, and eventually these Disney girls do have to \"wish upon a star\" to be big adult stars and that means appealing to other demographics as they age. Both of their performances were very effective, especially Gomez who showed sparks of brilliant thespian talent. Rachel Korine, who should be called Rachel So-Fine, was powerful in her delivery; and the same could be said of Ashley Benson's bravado effort. Korine's screenplay was not all that magnetic, but it was his directorial vision that was the filmmaking spark of \"Spring Breakers\". However, I don't know if Harmony was in a bad harmony state of mind when he orchestrated the film's very unauthentic and swashbuckling ending; which unfortunately downgraded the film from excellent to good. Nevertheless, \"Spring Break\" is not just T & A, and shits & giggles; and it is worth baring your bucks to experience. **** Good"

No. This was a terrible concept. We never got to know any of the characters. If this had been directed by a no name director, everyone would have said it was a disaster, but because Harmony's name is attached to it, many people think it's brilliant.\n\nIt had very little substance.

If you want to hear James Franco say \"Spring Break\" every 5-10 minutes and hope that Korine makes it sound mysterious or odd then you will be disappointed because the narrative in this movie is poor and gets annoying with the continuation. By far the worst work I have seen from the creator of Kids and Gummo.\n\nIf you want to save yourselves 94 minutes I suggest you watch other movies that don't rely heavily of style. A film is only as good as the volume it brings. The plot is just as important as style and that is the sole reason why this movie is being over-hyped by Korine fans."

A freaking below the average American movie I almost fell asleep watching ! OK we get it girls, you wanna break your image or something, you wanna be taken for serious actresses... Just try and find a role where you actually ACT and you'll see, it will come... But that's not the good movie, you just look fake trashy and we don't care about your character's fate.. I didn't anyway... The only good thing here is James Franco, of course. And the music. That's it. Forget the ads. Forget the poster. Just, forget about the existence of this movie."
