After seeing a wide selection of decent horror at Fantastic Fest a few weeks ago, I expected this to have some substance because it was picked to screen at the Austin Film Festival. All I can think of is that someone must have blackmailed the programmers because it's terrible.\n\nThe dailogue is either very clich\u00e9, or very stilted (and often both). There are serious continuity issues. The gratuitous sex scene was so completely sudden it seemed like an excerpt from a porn movie. The wigs are terrible, and the costuming as bad. There is no character development, and the motivations shown on screen seem more like red herrings than anything else.\n\nI can't think of anything redeeming about this film other than I didn't pay money just to see it."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I heard that Uwe Boll had challenged several of his critics to a boxing match, I thought it was an example of the man failing to understand reactions. Rather than come out looking like a misunderstood hero, he comes off as a spoiled child. So when I hear people calling Uwe the new Ed Wood, I just want to point out that this demonstrates ignorance regarding Wood. It is insulting to the poor guy. You see, Wood made one of the most daring (if staggeringly inept) films that challenged people's perceptions of transvestism and gender roles, long before this became a common theme in Hollywood. His major feature was that he lived only to make films, and did so because of motives other than cash. Boll, on the other hand, says absolutely nothing in his films that is of any value, and has shown himself in the media to be the most cynical, thoughtless idiot that ever drew breath. Another classic example of the difference between Boll and Wood, perfectly illustrated by BloodRayne, is that Wood's films made narrative sense.\n\nIf you have not played any of the video games upon which BloodRayne is based, then it will make very little sense to you. The parts about Rayne being the child of a vampire and a human, I get, but the film is loaded with references to artifacts that the villain needs in order to gain power, which Rayne must obviously stop him from acquiring. This reminds me of the sequence from Bakshi's adaptation of The Lord Of The Rings in which the explanation of what the One Ring is and what it does was meant to be delivered. By failing to deliver this critical information in a manner that makes sense to the viewer, both films end up disjointed and pointless. Only BloodRayne makes it much, much worse by jumping around from location to location, showing confrontations between Rayne and various enemies without a pause for explanation as to why this is significant. Ten bucks to anyone who can figure out exactly why Boll chose to end the film with a bunch of flashbacks to disjointed events that have no connection to the film's \"present time\", when the climactic slaying would have done just fine.\n\nAnother of Boll's few talents is to classically miscast. Kristanna Loken is surprisingly good as the titular character, and puts in a far better performance than I would have credited her with after that abysmal Terminator rip-off. It is certainly far better than the film deserves. Michelle Rodriguez looks extremely angry to be there. Matthew Davis has this stupid expression on his face all the time that appears to be him begging for some direction. Michael Madsen, Billy Zane, and Udo Kier literally are on autopilot. But Meat Loaf, the poor guy, seems to be trying to take his role seriously, and never have I see an actor look so uncomfortable in his work. He almost looks as if he is going to have a stroke from all the \"what the hell am I doing here?\" instructions his brain is trying to process. But the real gem here is Ben Kingsley, winner of one Academy Award and nominee for three others. He seriously looks as if he is going to burst out in laughter at any second during his scenes with Loken. And who can honestly blame him?\n\nA mention must be made of the abysmal special effects here, too. Boll at least knows that the audience for a film based on this video game expects to see blood, and a lot of it. However, like every other aspect of his films, the delivery is so staggeringly inept that it makes one wonder how Boll can be so blind to this. Not only does the head of one opponent look despicably fake, the looks on the faces of the extras when they are shown chopping things up with their swords is utterly hilarious. Someone had to direct them to assume that expression, as swinging an actual sword hard enough to sever a limb involves enough exertion that one at least pulls some kind of face in the process. They said it best in Showdown In Little Tokyo - beheadings are not as easy as they look. Yet Boll seems to think he can silence individuals who feel he is utterly inept as a director by hitting them. If I could say one thing to his face right now, it would be that keeping silent and working on making a genuinely good film would have worked a lot more.\n\nSo I mean it when I say this film is not as bad as many others have said - it is even worse. A competent director like Wolfgang Petersen would have connected the story together properly, and at least shot the violence in a convincing fashion. A brilliant director such as Paul Verhoeven would have found a way to satirise the social mores of the eighteenth century, and delivered enough convincing violence to give the MPAA fits at the same time. As much as Boll would like to pretend otherwise on the basis of sales figures in countries where they would probably not understand the abysmal dialogue anyway, he is nowhere near the league of Petersen or Verhoeven. And that is a big part of what makes his films so insulting to the general public. Boll would like us to believe that he is some kind of misunderstood genius who keeps striking out with critics because they do not understand his message. Well, Boll, the disjointed plot aside, I understand you just fine. The thing is, when I do understand your films, I do not want them anymore.\n\nSo I gave BloodRayne a two out of ten. A one would only further its position on the bottom one hundred, and it is deserving of infamy in neither sense of the word. Avoid."

        "review_detailed_main": "Where to start with this one? I'll point out that i watched it only because i heard that Kristanna Loken shows her boobies here. I didn't play the game nor have i known anything about the plot from that point of view. So i'm writing this solely on the movie experience.\n\nI must point out that the movie has its good sides.\n\nMost notably Ben Kingsleys horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE wig. I couldn't stop myself to burst into laughter anytime he was on screen. Its simply hilarious and worth the admission price alone.\n\nAnother good thing is the guy with the mullet (Matthew Davis). He looked almost as ridiculous as Ben Kingsley with a wig. By the way, I had no idea that mullets were that popular in 19th century Romania but the filmmakers sure proved me wrong. Maximum respect for the mullet Matthew, wear it proudly.\n\nOf course you do get to see Kristanna Lokens boobs in a raunchy, makes no sense at all, sex scene so that also is a good thing.\n\nI must point out that fight scenes, although they occur pretty rarely, are pretty rich with gore. They really surprised me there and i must say that i wasn't disappointed by that aspect of the movie. And you wont be either. Of course if you aren't into the bloody mess type of stuff the fight scenes will suck. But hey, who isn't into bloodbaths anyway? So some really good stuff there as well.\n\nNow for the not so great aspects of the movie.\n\nFirst of all the dialogs are completely and utterly, mind numbingly stupid. Its like a 6 year old wrote all the dialogs. The screenplay is very bad too. Think \"American Ninja 2\" in 19th century Romania when you think about the screenplay and dialogs in the movie. Really, really naive and infantile stuff there. Also they stole one ninja trick from American Ninja 2, you'll see it in one of the final scenes in the movie. I guess you could call it a homage to it though. Come to think of it, no, you couldn't. Its just plane old plagiarism.\n\nActing sucks too. Ben Kingsley just stares in the camera with his bad wig, Kristanna Loken does a lot of moaning and thats about it. Don't expect wonders from Michael Madsen either. Billy Zane does his thing regardless of anything, so if you like his style he could be acceptable. I like it.\n\nOh yeah, they have a MeatLoaf cameo. Now thats what i call weak. Then again, the topless babes in his scenes totally make up for his fat ass.\n\nThe director Uwe Boll isn't really that bad as people say he is. He gave us blood and tits, yes. And in a pretty good way, i might add. But he delivered nothing more. Blood and tits go without saying for modern day directors anyway. So i'll point out that he sucks as well but not as much as meatloaf.\n\nAlthough this movie is really bad I'm not sorry i watched it. If you want watch it and if you'll appreciate the trashy aspects in the movie you wont be sorry either.\n\nI'll give this one a 4/10."

Why, after wasting nearly 2 hours of my life watching this trash, should I waste another hour or so dissing this movie, when everything about it has already been killed stone dead by previous reviewers? Because, dear friends, I am so excited I just had to share with you my delight at finding the \"worst cameo of all time\", so magnificent in its awfulness that it could (with sheer effort of will) only be equalled, but never beaten.\n\nIt was Sunday. Raining. What the hell, \"Bloodrayne\" sounded good. Hmmm, Masden, Kingsley, Zane...can't be so bad.\n\nAfter around 20 minutes or so of this \"crowning turd\" of a movie my \"intellectual defence mechanism\" automatically kicked-in and took my mind away to my next vacation, what to have for dinner, and the contents of my Partner's trousers. Sailing away on a sea of serenity(did I actually fall asleep?)I thought myself immune and totally protected from the train wreck of a movie unfolding on the other side of my eyelids. But then....wait! What's this? Snippets of dialogue totally unconnected with the Tequilla Sunrise I was drinking began to pervade my mind. Slowly at first, but growing in intensity. Warily, fearful that I may inadvertently catch another glimpse of Ben Kingsley's excruciating acting/staring, I opened one eye. Was I seeing/hearing things? I pulled myself up in the chair and opened the other eye (after assuring myself that Kingsley was nowhere to be seen). There, in front of me...what can never be described by a thousand monkeys on a thousand typewriters for a thousand years. The root canal work of movie making, the Xanadu of awfulness....Meatloaf trying to character-act.\n\nI checked out the other movie-goers...hmmm, not many left....and they were all, very much like myself, staring wide eyed and open mouthed at witnessing the birth of a legend. Seriously, it was like watching the first moon landing all over again. This is one piece of crap for man...a whole turd for mankind.\n\nI am sorry that I go on a little, but I cannot find words to describe the cameo piece by Meatloaf, in fact probably such words do not exist - they must be invented - \"discrapungent\" - try that one. I can only try to capture the magnificent awfulness by describing the effect that it had on myself and, I suspect, the other viewers.\n\nIf you haven't seen it (and I beg you all to do so) cut along to any cinema brave enough to show it and set your alarm clock for around 50 minutes. If you have trouble sleeping at the beginning, don't worry, Ben Kingsley will stare you into blessed catatonia....trust me."

I was SO wrong. The acting quality that I had expected was not there at all. In fact, even Ben Kingsley, who I thought would be good (I've liked other things of his) was awful. Kristinna Locken was so emotionless that you wanted to cry from frustration. Michelle Rodiguez was the only one with some convincing effort, but even then, she couldn't pull her character out of one-dimension. Although, the actors didn't have much to go on to begin with. The dialouge was laughably clich\u00e9 in parts and simply pathetic in others. It did NOTHING to help convey the characters emotions or thoughts, nor did it do well with explaining the story, trying for flashy and confusing explanations when simplicity was needed and other times being far too simple. All in all, this movie was horrible."

        "review_detailed_main": "I almost forgot that I had seen this a month ago. I remember being excited more for the fact that Uwe Boll was in attendance so I could hear what he had to say about film-making.\n\nWell, let's say his comments before and after the movie are revelations as to why he makes such crappy films. First off, he can't grasp why people savage his movies so much. He feels that the internet community gives him a hard time because he's German and he makes his movies with Nazi money (his quote, not mine. Of course, he was joking, right?) Secondly, he couldn't care less if the actors he has are right for the roles. In fact, finding actors is his last thing he does to secure financing for his films. Apparently, he thinks the story is strong enough to carry the film. So, this is why we end up with actors like Ben Kinglsey working alongside Michael Madsen. Really, the only thing they had was the time to do the movie and the earning of a paycheck. So, if this doesn't strike you as soulless film-making, I don't know what does. In essence, by waiting until the last possible moment to hire actors, he can make his movies with a secured budget.\n\nTh reason why I write this is because I heard his new \"epic\" In the Name of the King will be a four hour film split in half like Kill Bill. This depressed me to no end. Uwe Boll really is the next Ed Wood, even though Ed Wood cared about his actors and films."

While I can't honestly say that Bloodrayne is anything special, it's certainly not the complete disaster that it's supposed to be. There's no denying that several of the main actors are woefully miscast - Michael Madsen being the prime example - and there are some bizarre and distracting cameos from Michael Pare (whom I swear hasn't aged a day in the twenty five years since Streets of Fire), Billy Zane and Meat Loaf. But I still found Bloodrayne to be considerably more entertaining than Van Helsing (2004), the film it most resembles. In fact it's only slightly inferior to the similarly themed Underworld movies."

Afther that, she meets a fortuneteller (Geraldine Chaplin) who tells his father raped and killed her mother. Then she sets out to revenge her mother's rape by her father, Kagan ( Ben Kingsley), King of Vampires. Three vampire hunters, Sebastian (Matthew Davis), Katarin (Michelle Rodriguez) and Vladimir(Michel Madsen), from the Brimstone Society persuade her to join their cause. Meanwhile, Rayne falls in love with Sebastian and prepares her vengeance.\n\nThis exciting movie displays unstopped action, thrills ride, spectacular fighting, graphic violence, and brief nudism with mild sex scene. It packs large amount of guts and gore , there's a huge body count, this one actually knocks off an immense amount, several vampires are staked bloodily in the chest, even more bitten with large dents. There's really savage decapitation, plenty of bodies ripped in scraps and half, including some of the most tears ever, that spill lots of blood . Most of vampires and humans victims are relegated to being bitten in the throat and neck. Magnificent special and visual effects as well as excellent make-up department. Bone-chilling and atmospheric musical score and colorful and dark cinematography ; furthermore spectacular production design .The motion picture is regularly directed by Uwe Boll . All four of the films he has realized that were based upon video games, House of the Dead (2003), Alone in the Dark (2005), BloodRayne (2005) and BloodRayne II: Deliverance (2007) were listed on the bottom of barrel by the reviewers. Most of the other films he's directed, including Heart of America (2002), and Blackwoods (2002) are not widely available in America, but have received similarly low ratings among those who have seen them. All technicians and some actors participate in the following : BloodRayne II with Natassia Malthe, Zack Ward and again Michel Pare, Uwe Boll's fetish's actor. Recommended to those who amuse those kind of vampire films or those enjoy in general.Rating : average though some moments is entertaining."

I've played the games, and if you're looking for a perfect adaptation of the dilogy, this is not it. But I must say that they got the vibe of the games right, at least when the violence is concerned. Lots of blood and decaptations.\n\nBut that doesn't really matter. This is a movie, and regardless of being an adaptation or not, it should be judged in its own merits.\n\nSo how does it fare as a movie?

As well as seeing whether one of the worst directors of all time Uwe Boll was capable of making a good film. On top of that, like Ben Kingsley a lot as an actor and he is reason enough to see anything he's involved in. Did not have my hopes up, because even looking at the advertising and trailers 'Bloodrayne' looked awful.\n\nThe terrible reputation and dubious advertising do not lie. 'Bloodrayne' to me and many others really is that bad, bad actually is an understatement. Have come to the conclusion that Boll is incapable of making a halfway decent film, have not seen everything of his but all that has been seen has been terrible and as bad as their reputation. As someone who is usually very generous rating and reviewing films, 'Bloodrayne' does stand out as one of the worst films seen recently and actually full stop. Everything is abysmally executed and there are no redeeming qualities at all, have said that about very few films seen recently.\n\n'Bloodrayne' couldn't be more inept visually. Photography that is both chaotic and static, bacon-slicer-like editing, drab costumes that don't fit the setting, continuity errors galore (more than anybody can count), afterthought-like visual effects, lighting completely lacking in atmosphere, those can all be found. The music sounds cheap and is never dynamic with anything on screen, often working against it and like it belonged in another film entirely.\n\nWriting is horrendously stilted and cheesy, enough to make one want to vomit and the unintentional camp later on becomes exhausting. The action has no momentum or excitement whatsoever, is chaotically edited, under-rehearsed choreographically and a lot of it is incomprehensible. It really takes ineptitude to a whole new level. As is the story, it never comes to life and is not easy to follow often. Boll's direction is typically non-existent and cold, comparing him to Ed Wood is rather insulting when although Wood's films were the complete opposite of fine heart one could see that he had his heart in the right place (something that has never been the case with Boll). The characters are walking cliches that are neither interesting or worth rooting for, instead bland and irritating.\n\nYou know something is wrong when the best performance comes from an angry-looking Michelle Rodriguez. Elsewhere there is an emotionless lead, Meat Loaf's uncomfortable cameo and Michael Madsen and Billy Zane going through the motions. Worst of it is Kingsley in his worst ever performance, taking hamminess and chewing-scenery-to-pieces to mind-boggling extremes.\n\nSummarising, completely bloodless and appallingly awful. 1/10 Bethany Cox"

And i have to say i don't think it is.\n\nSure it's average to below average in most ways. Much of the dialogue is dull and uninspired. The script and screenplay mostly doesn't allow for the actors to unfold, to display their skills. The battle sequences are boring. And who the h... put that silly wig on Ben Kingsley, the guy is seriously a joke in this movie.\n\nBut there are also stuff that works - or works well enough for it to be a decent B-movie i should say. Kristanna Loken pulls it off the best she can with this script and manages to portray a slightly more vulnerable and down to earth type vampire hero. I think she also does well in her fight scenes. Michael Madsen although having nothing to work with looks good as a vampire hunter. Michelle Rodriguez is doing a good job as well.\n\nThe sound and score of the movie is also good and here and there actually manages to help build a little tension or suspense. Something that the movie often lacks.\n\nI'll admit any day that it's a flawed movie. Still there have been many big Hollywood production movies that are less worth watching than this."

        "review_detailed_main": "During my tour through 'Garbage cinema', i stumbled upon BloodRayne, which is apparently a video game adaptation, and it is common knowledge that those are generally horrific failures. There is no exception in this case, as this is a laughable piece of work that seems to have an obsession with insulting the viewers intelligence.\n\nThe cast features some acclaimed actors in the form of Ben Kingsley, Billy Zane & Michael Madsen, which is an unfortunate stain on their careers. Kingsley was the epitome of the dead eyed emotionless underperformer, and much of the same is true with Madsen, who seems to hate being in this film for the entire duration. Zane tries his best to surpass the abysmal script with his acting, but alas, he does not succeed. None of the actors are able to use even the slightliest of emotional ranges, as all of them are incapable of showing a different facial expression. Since some of the actors cast in the movie are indeed incredible, it is obvious they too had little motivation and ambition for such a ridiculous project as this. Every single actor & actress's line delivery in BloodRayne seems like a literal cue card reading session, and the dialogue is insultingly bad. My favorite has to be: 'My companion has gone missing, i do not know what has become of him!!!' which results in one of the most insultingly stupid prison breaks ever filmed.\n\nThere is no character development. There is not a sequence in which the characters are set up. There is nothing that is told about the characters, and there is simply absolutely nothing that drives them. Rayne's mother was raped by Kegan and seeks revenge, which is the most insulting & clich\u00e9 of motivations there is. It tries so hard to get the viewer to feel sympathy for Rayne because of this, but this clich\u00e9 victim classification is in reality just horrid writing. It is a common feminist delusion that they always classify themselves as the 'Common victim' in every circumstance and this film is basically a propaganda show of political correctness in that way. However, when a film is this bad, its ridiculous PC themes don't even really matter, as nobody could ever take anything about this film seriously.\n\nThere are a couple of scenes where we witness the aftermath of some event, and director Uwe Boll thinks it is necessary to throw in a couple of disjointed, horribly edited flashbacks in which the viewer learns absolutely nothing else than what they already knew before the flashback. Something simplistic is spoken, and Boll deems it necessary to throw in a flashback because it seems like he doesn't think audience can understand it without it. It is a slap in the face of the audience's intelligence, and also a slap in the face of this film's already nearly non existent intellectuality.\n\nWhile most of the cinematography in BloodRayne is sub par, it does have a couple of nice sweeping outdoor shots when characters ride through the country. However, it also features a lot of brightly lit forest scenes even though it is in the middle of the night & an obvious lack in color variation, as most of the film is grey and dark green. The original score, however, was very good, and these seem to be the only slightly redeeming factors of this snoozefest.\n\nThe many action sequences feature horrid slow & clunky choreography ( Especially Madsen, no idea how he managed to kill so many guys during this film when he is barely able to swing a sword ), and terrible editing. All of the actors in the film seem to be severely limited in athletics & choreography, and so this is hidden a bit by the fact that there are numerous amount of cuts and edits throughout the fights. The viewer can never see what is going on, or how the fight is turning out. Boll is only interested in showing protagonists kill people and trying to hide their clunky swordplay with his horrid quick editing which will probably damage your eyesight beyond repair. In the end, the film is a basic lesson in how NOT to film action sequences, as its choreography, editing & overview of the fights is just horrible.\n\nBloodRayne has terrible acting, writing, choreography, editing, & characters. While some decent shots in its cinematography and an excellent original score make sure it doesn't wind up in the category with some of the actual worst of all time, it is still a sure contender for the places a little bit behind them."

I will be lined up (in a line consisting of 2 people)in front of our local theatre to buy tickets for the first show. I think the mistake that some of the posters have made is either not seeing the crap-tastic \"House of the Dead\" or the most unwatchable of his films \"Alone in the Dark\", or thinking his films will get better as he learns his \"craft\".\n\nI was once like you, tricked into seeing House of the Dead only to be shat on for an hour and 35 minutes. But after Alone in the Dark came out, I discovered the blinding and wonderful truth of his films. Uwe Boll is a throw back to the great \"USA Up ALL Night\", staring Shannon Tweed and or Shannon Whirry, & generic slasher films of the early and mid - eighties. These films have a special place in heart for whatever reason. It might be because the represent a special part of movie making, the bad formula film.\n\nHe makes movies based on a formula, a proved formula. Get a known brand with a built in fan base. (in this case, video games that are past their shelf life.)Put this brand into a profitable movie genre such as teen sex comedy (I'm looking at you National Lampoon) or horror film. Wait to cast the film until the last possible minute in order to get as many \"name\" stars as you can for as cheap as you can. (suprise- many stars take rolls just for a paycheck or because the can squeeze it in between projects and collect a paycheck)Throw in gore/mind-numbing action and or nudity and you have yourself a film that will make back it's budget (between 10 to 20 million) worldwide before it ever sees DVD. Roger Corman made himself a name and a fortune doing this type of film making.\n\nI'm not saying that his films are any good or even watchable at times. What I'm saying is that I crack the hell up every time I watch one. Enjoy them for what they are, Huge wastes of someone's hard warned money. I swear that I laugh more at these films than I laugh at films like \"Meet the Fockers\".\n\nDo yourself a favor and rent Alone in the Dark and see if you can keep from laughing when the Tara Reid says New-found-land. It's like angels singing.\n\nRoscoe P. Coltrane"

        "review_title": "Well... I'm surprised that I actually kind of liked it (don't kill me!)",
        "review_detailed_main": "Okay, I actually kind of liked this movie. Why? Well, as far as pure entertainment goes, I was actually entertained. I laughed at a lot of the acting and dialog, and the fight editing was a nightmare, but in the end, I still had a decent time with the movie. It gave me what I expected, but with some decent (and some really bad) acting.\n\nLet's start with the Ed Wood pluses, also known as the \"so bad it's good\" material. For starters, Ben Kingsley. I have never seen such an accomplished actor do such a terrible job in my life! I couldn't stop laughing whenever he was on screen. I mean, it really seemed as if it was just a wax dummy of him set on a chair. His dialog was uber flat, and I honestly think they just got a sample of his voice and had a computer read his lines. But... he made the entire movie uber campy. It just felt right. Also, there is the clunky dialog. Some of the dialog does work, namely when the characters speak in more modern dialects, but when they try to get all old English or whatever the words become clunkier than a cart with square wheels being pulled by a man with no arms and legs. Michael Madsen also phoned in his performance, but it was ten times better than the \"acting\" he did in Sin City. And by the end of the movie I had very few problems with him. He did what he had to, nothing more. So, there are the bad parts. They seem minor, but oh are they major. Namely because they are all constantly apparent. One bad part that wasn't funny was the constant shots of people riding on horses. It got old very fast.\n\nThe actual good parts come in the form of a few things. For one is Michelle Rodrigez. She really, honestly tried with this movie, and came off as very credible. Her accent, her movements, everything... it just worked. She made this movie watchable. Also, the lead was very well played by Kristina Lochen (sp?). Her dialog is junk, but she can fight, and she plays the tough girl very well. And she looked the part. And Billy Zane, in a small role, is a blast to watch. He eats the cheesy dialog up, and you can tell he is enjoying himself. They should have given him more screen time! A big plus for this movie is the fact that there is actually a coherent story this time. Yes, actually story in a Bolle video game movie! It's not a great story, but it's a fleshed out, coherent story. Alone in the Dark and House of the Dead both were messes in the story department, basically moving from action scene to action scene. Here there is more time for characters to talk, interact. For any other director this movie would be a total disaster, but looking at Bolle's past video game adaptations I would have to say that he is improving in leaps and bounds. He's still not a great director, but he's getting better.\n\nThe usual problems come up though. The fight scenes are horribly edited, with some very bad film speed affects being thrown in. He needs to stop doing that, because he actually gets the fight angles right. He shoots from more of a distance, allowing the audience to see the action. Sadly the editing is so off, and some of the effects so distracting, that some decent action seems incoherent and choppy.\n\nOver all, well, this movie is far from being good, but it does what it set out to do. It's actually about on par with the first Mortal Kombat movie. I am not a fan of the director by any means, but I have to say, I had no problem with this movie. I got a kick out of it. It has it's cheese value, and I knew that it would. If you go in expecting anything but pure cheese then you'll be disappointed. If you go in and plan to have a few laughs, crack a few jokes, and just enjoy the film, then you actually will have a good time with it. I know a lot of people are going to just breeze past this review, but I have to say, I have seen some REALLY bad movies, and this isn't one of them. It's got a decent plot, some good acting (and some REALLY bad acting), and it's got action.\n\nI have a feeling that the Dungeon Siege movie will suck though. It's like... three fricking hours long! TO MUCH!"

Bloodrayne is so far one of two movies I could not endure to watch to the end. It was excruciating. I understand fully the critique against Dr Uwe Boll, how that person can even call himself a director is a farce at best. I must shamefully admit that I would have endured the movie if there had been the same protagonists as in the original video game - occult Nazis. (Since Raiders of the lost Ark, they're my favorites as bad guys go.) Now, we're treated to the same level of excellence as your average Buffy TV episode. Or, in the form of continuity, better. If you're considering watching this movie, take a long hard look inside and come to the conclusion it's not worth it. Please? I might even stretch to defending piracy for this one movie. :)\n\nOh, and the other film I could not endure? Battlefield: Earth with John Travolta."

I'd be interested to see the script because I'm wondering if there are any contractions at all. Nothing like over annunciated crap lines to make a bad movie really stand out.\n\nI won't even try to explain the plot because there really wasn't one. Just think of vampire and fantasy movie clich\u00e9s and you have Bloodrayne. I really felt like I was watching a movie written by a ten year old Dungeons and Dragons fan. There was no point to the movie at all and I didn't care what happened to anyone.\n\nBilly Zane was great, Meatloaf was brilliant, but everyone else was just bad.\n\nIf you took Interview With a Vampire, the Dungeons and Dragons movie, and maybe the sequel to the Dungeons and Dragons movie, plus the Conan the Barbarian cartoon series and that vampire movie with Jim Carrey for good measure, and threw it all into a pot but made the main character a girl who can't fight but manages to defeat the world's most powerful vampire and you gave a lot of main characters raging mullets then, and only then would you have something like Bloodrayne.\n\nThis movie made me wish I was watching Underworld."

If you find the lead as sexy as I did just watching her walk around is pretty cool, although it appeared she put on about 10 pounds by the end of the movie, when she changed costumes. She was still smokin hot throughout the entire film.\n\nDownsides? There's plenty!- there is NO acting to speak of this movie- looks like everyone went to the George Lucas school of wooden line delivery in this one- ESPECIALLY the older leader of the vampire fighters- I couldn't decide what to spend more time being in shock of - his horrible wig that looked like a french poodle humping his head or his lines delivered as if he was on some heavy medication reading his lines from a teleprompter- seeing them for the first time in his life.\n\nI already knew this movie sucked when I went to see it- but then I fell in love with the lead- she's so yummy she can make this dead dog limp home and the sex scene is worth the price of admission although it was WAY too short. Lots and lots of hardcore gratuitous sex with the lead of this movie could have made this movie a cult classic for generations.. too bad they didn't put that feature in here.. hahah.\n\nAnyways if you watch this with the understanding that it will be like watching a good XENA episode you won't be let down very much and be able to enjoy yourself. This is not a professional quality theatrical release- it's more like a made for TV in a lot of areas.. except that sex scene.. woo hoo!\n\nHere's hoping this actress finds some better roles for her fine ass.\n\nPLOT: A half-vampire redheaded hottie is tracking down her vampire dad to kick his ass for killing her mother. Along the way she befriends some other vampire hunters and off we go on a mission of high body count vampire killing. Watching the lead is worth the price of admission cuz.. she's hot dude."

Many have laughable effects, are more trite, with worse acting, sets and costumes. You can see them any evening on SciFi or the other basic cable channels.\n\nThe biggest problem with Bloodrayne may be that it attempts to be more than it is. Compared to most direct-to-video fare, it's not half bad. I saw it on TV, so I'm not comparing it to other major releases from big studios. I believe people are judging it based on their expectations as much as anything.\n\nI thought Kristanna Lokken was pretty good. Fortunately, she plays the main character. She was a good choice for Rayne.

It's omnipresent (which is not always a bad thing in these sorts of films), but it manages to work up considerable excitement and even a fair measure of grandeur (aided in part by an odd motivic echo of the opening of Cliff Eidelman's score for 'Star Trek VI' ). The closing sequence of the film is much more impressive than might have been expected, in large part due to the music. In fact, proportional to the overall quality of the respective films, this score is considerably better than that for 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe'.\n\nThe production values, while far short of the Narnia and Lord of the Rings films, are not so cheap as to detract from the fun. Some of the sets (Kagan's central hall, for example), have real presence, and the FX are always at least passable and sometimes striking. The cinematography , while generally derivative in style and appearance, is at its best in the slower sequences; the action sequences tend to be choppy and even unintentionally blurry. In fact, had this film been a little less determined to whip up action so often, it would have been the better for it. There's a nice sequence where Rayne walks through a town market and sees the vampires beneath the human faces which suggests how much the film would have benefited from a less frenetic pace, for example.\n\nThe weakest element is the acting. Kristanna Loken, in the title role, is adequate and sometimes expressive (her final on-screen moments do not draw all of their power from the music); given more room to develop, her character portrayal might well have been more emotionally moving. Geraldine Chaplin manages to make the small role of the Fortuneteller relaxed and believable. Ben Kingsley has physical presence but little more as the villain; Michael Madsen is wretched as the leader of the anti-vampire group, as is Meat Loaf as an rather louche vampire. The rest of the players are generally competent but unexciting.\n\nThe screenplay, by Guinevere Turner, is not as confusing as some have claimed (or at least it didn't especially confuse me). There's not much in the way of character development, but as that is rarely the case in sword-and-sorcery films it seems unfair to belabor the point here. The motivations of the major characters are reasonably clear, if one-dimensional, and there is at least some attempt to give Rayne more depth than her type is usually allowed, which pays off in the ambiguous final shot.\n\nI suspect that many people have watched this film expecting it to be wretched, given the reputation of director Uwe Boll. Having never seen any other Boll films, I am in no position to comment on his work as a whole, but it strikes me that the reaction to this one, at least, is rather unfair. Although it's not very good, neither is it awful; while there are many better films even within its genre, there are surely many more that are far far worse.\n\n--This review was written regarding the theatrical release. Some years later I happened to see the DVD version, which is, oddly enough, noticeably worse. Apparently the production company tamped down Uwe Boll's desire for gore for the U.S. release, a desire he was able to exercise fully in the DVD version. The result is a much choppier (so to speak) and less effective film. I begin to understand why so many people think Boll is such a bad director....--"

In the Game Bloodrayne takes place during WWII and allows players to kill Nazis and zombies the movie went in a completely different path and takes place in the middle ages. The story for this movie is terrible, Directing is substandard, acting is bad, and the characters are written poorly. the only almost redeeming thing in this entire movie is that you get a shot of Kristanna Loken's tits. they are nice but really not worth the time it takes to fast forward to that part of the film little lone watch the stupid thing.

Sadly, I even read a review posted here that said it was awful, but thought to myself, \"Surely this person just doesn't like these types of movies.\" Wrong!! Anybody that enjoys movies would hate this. This is what they should play to the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay to break them. The lines were so stilted and monotone that at times I wondered if the actors were even in to it, or if they just wanted to get it over with. How far has Ben Kingsley fallen? Did he forget that he won an Oscar? And Michelle Rodriguez, has she been in a movie (or television show) where she didn't play the sulky, pouty, scowly part? What about the Sebastian guy-he reminded of a mulletted Stiffler-kind of like the role Seann William Scott had in Old School. Speaking of Sebastian, how tough can vampire killers be when they're named Vladimir and Sebastian. Aren't those Muppet characters? I won't bother to get into much more. Read other reviews for support of my ranting. One thing that I thought was really bad was the blood in the fight scenes. Whoever did the special effects must think that all people have tons of blood right at the surface of their skin and it's really pressurized. The spraying blood was so ridiculous that I couldn't even laugh at it, I was just mad that somebody was paid money to do that.\n\nSo, please, if you haven't seen the movie, don't disregard this review, or the million others that say that this movie should be put out of its misery."

My first reaction was laughing. Then I cried. I still can't believe that the movie can be so ruined. It totally cracked my idea for bad movie. Even \"Tom & Jerry\" has better effects than this \"creation\" of the incredible mind of the director - Uwe Bol. Dumb, simple kills, some sort of sword fighting, not really successful of course, some corpses and blood more like water then like blood. I can't understand that man.\n\nThe actors. Horrible. I really want to know why was Kristina Loken chosen to play Rayne's role, and what does Madsen do in this movie? But who else then Kristina Loken would agree to play in movie directed by Uwe Bol? Madsen. I don't know why. It seems like some kind of mistake, because his place surely isn't in this movie. The acting is out of the question. The scenario is like written by four years old boy and then thrown to the garbage, where Uwe and his team found it. The dialogs are strange. Some serious guys are may be talking about the end of the human race. We are scared. This could be the horror element in the movie. When they finish talking they fight a bit and that's supposed to be the action element. We have successfully completed the genre requirements.\n\nThe whole thing is more like comedy than horror or action. There was nothing unique or interesting in this movie. The director even hired prostitutes for some of the scenes. I think that any person with a bit mind in his head WILL NOT watch this... thing. If Uwe does not understand that he CAN'T make movies it's time to realize it."

The reason that a lot of people push and go out of their way to say that movies such as this suck are because they would rather the film have a large muscle bound man without a shirt as the star, than an attractive woman. I think that those people are very sexist.\n\nIt is true that this movie had a terrible script and dialogue. However, that isn't because of director Uwe Boll, or actress Kristanna Loken at all. Those factors point directly to the writer Guinevere Turner.\n\nThe customs were very accurate to the game. Except for Kristanna Loken's hair\u0085 which wasn't red enough and appeared blonde in some scenes... but that would be because of the makeup artist not Kristanna. The fighting was magnificently sequenced and looked realistic. Now if you do want to point and say an actor did bad like everyone keeps doing, than you can point at Matthew Davis whom looked as though he were smiling even at the most odd moments.\n\nIf you like pointless action packed films, with a lot of blood, and you don't mind a female star, than this movie is right down your alleyway. But if you want storyline from this you might as well read a bunch of fortune cookies, because that is all that you'll get here. Heck I have crapped better scripts than Guinevere Turner, she slaughtered what was a great and enjoyable video game.\n\nPeople don't listen to what these sexist bastards are saying. Use your own judgment without using other peoples judgment. And if you want an action film with storyline than you should see something like pulp fiction, not something taken from a freaking video game... common!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Ok...first off, is this Ben Hur? Braveheart? Or the Ten Commandments? Nope. This in no way is on par with the greatest period movies of all time. Nor was it intended so.\n\nSecond, when reading the reviews it is painfully obvious that people:\n...don't like Uwe Boll and thus could not judge the movie on its merits, or\n...are video game fans who had very specific expectations for this movie and again, were unable to look beyond that, or\n... compare this movie to some of the best and most expensive genre movies, or\n\n\nIt's stunning to read such bad reviews on a movie that simply was not bad. As mentioned, this is not a huge mega budget period film, nor is it a faithful and true recreation of the game. It was not intended to be either, yet people continue watching and reviewing it as if it were. The fact is, not many directors would take on such a film with the budget it had and a) do any better, b) leave it as bloody and violent, or c) get the names that this film has. I don't know about you, but I love medieval (or earlier) period films and they are not made nearly as much as I would like. Why? Because they're extremely expensive to do properly. Now maybe you would rather not have one at all, opposed to getting something that is above average in nearly every regard compared to the majority of similar films released in recent years. Sure, there's always going to be (the rare) exceptions, but for the most part they are simply nowhere near as good as this. That's not to say this deserves awards, but if people insist on comparing (falsely I might add) then this is all worth noting.\n\nSo...the movie. I cannot speak to its affinity toward the game, as I couldn't care less, but as a story, it's fine. It's rather cookie cutter, straight out of the earlier sword and sandal films or other medieval supernatural films, or for that matter, any period vampire movie or even newer vamp movie. Surprisingly, I haven't heard a single comparison to the Resident Evil or Underworld franchises, which surprises me. But I digress.\n\nThe production is on par with the budget it was given. Period. There are some high points and some not so high points, but the pace is swift and keeps the characters moving toward their ultimate goals. The acting is average, at best, and could be better, especially considering the number of \"seasoned\" actors in the cast. It certainly wasn't as \"piss poor and awful\" as others suggest. Good? Maybe not quite, but awful? Nope.\n\nSpecial fx are decent, though done in a manner that leaves little to linger on screen for more than a brief flash. Costumes and sets were enjoyable to look at. Some beautiful camerawork on the large-scale sweeping panoramas, and the lighting is equally as well done.\n\nAll in all, this is a very avaerage flick, with some above average sequences and a few below average sequences. Anybody who reviews it as poorly as many have, are hating purely for reasons outside the boundaries of the movie itself.\n\nNotes on parental content:\n\n\nI dunno folks...Bloodrayne is certainly not going to win any awards, but I felt it very entertaining, honestly...from start to finish. Not sure that I would buy the film either, but I could easily watch it again down the road a piece.\n\nMy advice is to watch it for what it is - a loosely based interpretation on a video game franchise; and I do mean loosely. Enjoy the costumes, the action (of which some is actually good), and the general storyline that involves castles & vampires. There just aren't that many watchable flicks with this byline."

The movie follows the game's plot but he executes it very poorly.

All day I had been looking forward to the release of this glorious display of cinematic creativity, and I was sure to inform everybody I knew. You see, we had been there at the opening of \"Alone In The Dark,\" and afterward we were all hardcore fans. After watching \"House Of The Dead\" shortly afterward, we all wondered how that one had slipped passed us when it had been showing in theaters.\n\nUnfortunately for me and my celebrating crew, disaster struck; the movie wasn't playing anywhere nearby. In fact, the closest location was Marysville, Washington, a city about 100 miles south of the one in which we all call our home. It was then that we knew what we had to do. We all drove into (our) town separately and parked our cars, meeting up at about 8:30 in the evening. That left us with an hour and fifteen minutes to cover the distance. Tragically, the man we chose to be driver (his driving skills far surpass our own) was unable to get off work. Thinking quickly, we bribed his manager and were on our way by 8:45.\n\nDown the freeway we raced, stopping only briefly for gas. Praying that there were no police in the vicinity, we averaged about 100 miles per hour as we sped passed car and truck alike. \"I'm gonna be all kinds of angry if we die before we get to this movie,\" I shouted over the horrible clanking of his rapidly disintegrating engine, \"And what in God's name is that noise.\" The car was shaking violently, but we all knew the risks.\n\nAt long last we pulled into to parking lot and raced inside. After buying tickets and popcorn, we made it into the theater just in time to see the preview for his next film: \"In The Name Of The King.\" It was then that we knew that this tradition of ours would resume in the coming winter. That was a thought for a later time, however. We sat down and spent the next hour and a half enjoying the underrated brilliance of a particular German director."

I expected BloodRayne to be splaying tons of Nazi soldiers, but instead, she did very little, but slice into poorly filmed bodies in which blood sprayed around like an uncontrolled fire-hose. Director Uwe Boll must have been highly intoxicated when he thought he could pull this one off. Every scene and every piece of the storyline seemed to be splotched together from other vampire and medieval movies. This movie falls along the same lines of every other video game adaption, disgracing the game and making a poor name for itself. BloodRayne is maybe one of the most disappointing movies and dullest films I've seen in a long while."

The gal from T3, Kristanna Lokken, plays Bloodrayne, and reminds us again that she has absolutely no acting talent. She is, however easy on the eye. Nevertheless, she is no match for the babes from the UNDERWORLD and RESIDENT EVIL series. Hell, she isn't even up to the likes of Charlize Theron as Aeon Flux, a role equally worthy of a Razzie if ever there was one. You know how bad a movie truly is when someone like David Warner or Jeremy Irons or Ben Kingsley turns up as the movie's cardboard villain. Kingsley wins the honors here. He is ludicrous, and seems to know it. He mostly stands around and emits great pauses between snatches of horribly inane dialog. Kingsley has taken on several very bad roles over the years, and I think this one tops all others. Plus Michael Madsen as a vampire hunter mumbles and stumbles his way through yet another Z-grade production. So what's left? The battle scenes are clumsily staged. The gore is pretty standard. There is one hot scene featuring a badly-bewigged Meat Loaf surrounded by a bevy of naked women, who just so happen to be real-life streetwalkers. Too bad the focus is on the Loaf."

I had the misfortune of watching Boll's previous \"effort\", Alone in the Dark, and I knew nothing good could come out of this crazed German and a vampire/slayer video game franchise.\n\nFirst of all, the story is quite different from the game's, changing Rayne's birth from XXth century to XVIth century (or was it XVIIth?). Rayne's character wasn't fine at all: the hair color wasn't right, the eye color wasn't right, the Rayne-trademark-outfit just didn't look good (and that was a VERY important factor), and overall... it all wasn't right. I really liked Loken's role on Terminator 3, but what I saw in this movie was QUITE far away from that, just like everyone's poor quality acting.\n\nThe story is weak, characters are not memorable at all, Bloodrayne's vampires look even faker than Buffy's, the camera moves a LOT during the fighting scenes, the sex scene would rather fit on a porn movie (it came out of nowhere), dialogues are cheesy, and most of the movie is just TOO dark.\n\nWho's to blame? The actors? The director? The people who keep giving Boll millionaire budgets even though his movies end up in financial failure? May God keep this man away from Metal Gear Solid..."

Don't need to tell me twice.\n\nThere is not one iota of originality within BloodRayne and it follows the tried and tested (sometimes successful) formula of \"Half human, half vampire hero/heroine-in-really-bad-costume must stop evil head vampire from slaughtering the world\", or something like that. Blade, Underworld..been there, done that, got the t-shirt, thanks. Which genius decided we needed another take? And this isn't even a half- baked attempt, this is just an exercise in really, really bad film-making.\n\nThe acting is absolutely horrible and all I can suppose is that the likes of Rodriguez, Madsen and Kingsley must have been desperate for a paycheck. Loken, after her turn in Terminator 3, well she just wanted her big break. All the poor girl got was a big belly flop of a role in a stinker of a movie.\n\nWith a plot as fresh as week-old roadkill, laughable, stilted dialog and action scenes with as much style and grace as a monkey in a tutu, BloodRayne is a complete and utter waste of time. Easily the worst movie so far for 2006."

However, I did like the actress they got to do Rayne, but the director, oh my Lord, he has butchered every video game movie he has done (by the way his name is Uwe Boll), and sadly he also got his hands on another video game movie that is still in production (it's called Far Cry, when it come out, heed my warning and stay the hell away from it). Now, I'm not saying that all of Uwe Boll's movies are bad, it's just that his specialty are artsy foreign flicks, which are sadly probably better than his video game movies.

Much of what I found disappointing in the movie did not have to do with the director, but with things that may have been \"out of their hands.\" Ben Kingsley's performance felt completely uninspired. He may as well have been reading a cue card without punctuation marks. Michael Madsen felt somewhat out of place, but his portrayal as Vladimir was acceptable. Michelle Rodriguez, well, I just love her work. And Kristanna Loken did a very good job as Rayne. She seemed to actually care about the character. It may not have been an Oscar-winning performance, but she still played the killer with a heart believably (which, unfortunately, is not really who Bloodrayne is in the video games, but is acceptable for the sake of the script.) The script did seem weak at some points, and could have tied up a couple of loose ends, but overall it served it's purpose. For being a video game movie, it may not have been as good as \"Doom,\" but it greatly surpassed what had become the norm with movies like \"Street Fighter\" and \"Double Dragon.\" Finally, I must speak about the director. I did sit through part of \"House of the Dead\" and simply could not bear it, though I really didn't give it half a chance. I expected a similar experience with Bloodrayne. Well, Uwe Boll, you have surprised me. His choice of camera angles and shots were interesting and had dramatic effect. He really does want to make a good movie. His efforts show through. I left the theater feeling pleased. There was some heart underneath this film. I am actually looking forward to his Dungeon Siege film, which was in the trailers.\n\nSo to recap, was it a great movie? No. Will it win awards? No. Was it enjoyable? Definitely. Would I watch it again? I don't doubt it. Perhaps in the end, it felt like a really good B-movie. If you watch this with the mindset the Uwe Boll is not a Hollywood director, but he does have a lot of heart, you very well may enjoy this film."

It was mainly the actors and the dialogue that made this such a bad movie. My friend and I could not decide who was a worst actor Madsen or Rodriguez? Personally I feel it was a tie.\n\nMadsen looked like he was drunk the entire film and Rodriguez was trying way to hard to pull of an accent of some kind. It was almost as bad as watching Keanu Reeves try to do an English accent. Honestly at one point Madsen and Rodriguez switched accents, and then they switched back again. It went from English to Romanian to Street and back to English again. Even Ben Kingsley the great Ben Kingsley sucked as well. As for the main actress Kristanna Loken, if not for my huge crush on her I would not of seen this movie to begin with.

While that description accurately describes this film, it cannot even stake a claim to be smut when its single sex scene fails to be even mildly interesting, never mind erotic.\n\nFor those of you who have seen this film, my sympathies; for those who have not, wait for the DVD, it should be available in about 15 minutes."

When you see \"Bloodrayne\" fighting you should think that your mother do it better. Awful. Anyway when i've started to watch the movie i thought that it will be good. (I played the game and it was fun and pretty good) After i finished it i was in the affect of misunderstanding around the end action. (She goes and sit to the throne -O_o- )\n\nSo if you don't want to see a really bad movie, please don't watch it. I like movies witches based on vampire stories, but this is not what i like. Anyway i think that a vampire has to be elegant, (and not just the clothes makes a vampire elegant, his/her move culture, smile, speech, turn up, and other qualities has to be elegant and special as well) in this movie vampires weren't so elegant, they weren't like vampire at all. No special skills (i mean some antigravity or something what can makes a vampire to be itself), all those were just actors with some funny acting skills who wanted to be a vampire in the screen, but as we see it didn't work."

The movie is a confused mess and even the top names that appear in the film can't save it from the awful dialouge and directing. It remains a mystery to me how Uwe can get the talented actors to appear in his movies and how he manages every time to pull the worst performance of there career.\n\nThe exception in bloodrayne is Michelle Rodriguez who manages to be convincing even with the lack of direction and awful script i only hope the movie does not damage the careers of any of the other amazing actors who appear in this crapfest.\n\nDespite being burnt time and time again i'm sure i will watch dungeon siege (i'm also pretty sure i'll hate it and kick myself again) and will continue to hold on to the slight hope that one day Uwe will actually make a good job of one of his movies because the video game fan in me still gets excited by the concept of game to movie franchise's.\n\nIf you are like me regardless of what I or anyone else says you will watch this movie just remember when your trying to throw yourself off a bridge for putting yourself through another Uwe Boll flick that one day he will be dead it is that thought alone allows me to continue to watch his crap.\n\nI tried to focus on the positive aspects of this movie but after proof reading what i wrote i can see i failed, oh well i did try."

The story was told pretty well and the direction the film took was consistent. The visuals, such as the set designs and locations where amazing. They paid attention to the details extremely well! The acting and the dialog was not so good though, and at times, pretty bad. The fight scenes were also good at time but many times were cheesy and out of pace. The best part of the film, many would argue, was the sex scene! I can honestly say, BEST I\"VE EVER SEEN! Overall, it was a good, different type of vampire movie."

When she escapes, she meets a fortuneteller (Geraldine Chaplin) that tells that her mother was raped by the king of the vampires Kagan (Ben Kingsley) and she decides to destroy her father. In her journey for revenge, she meets Vladimir (Michael Madsen) and Sebastian (Matthew Davis), the leaders of the fortress of vampire hunters Brimstone, and she joins their society. She seeks for powerful talismans to defeat Kagan, while the skilled warriors Vladimir and Sebastian train her to face the forces of Kagan and her human side falls in love for Sebastian.\n\n\"Bloodrayne\" is a great vampire movie and absolutely underrated in IMDb. The locations and cinematography in Romania are magnificent and I believe it would be impossible to build sets so spectaculars in another country; the cast is excellent, with Sir Ben Kingsley, Geraldine Chaplin, Michael Madsen, Michelle Rodriguez, Matthew Davis and the gorgeous Kristanna Loken; the story is full of action and the characters are very well developed. I have glanced many silly comments, but the winner is one that states that \"Kristanna Loken looks like a child instead of a woman\". Wow, this athletic actress is one of the most beautiful women of the cinema industry. Definitely this movie be included in Bottom 100 is one of the greatest absurd I have ever seen in IMDb. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Bloodrayne\""

        "review_detailed_main": "I'll start off by saying that I have seen some of the other works of Uwe Boll; Alone in the Dark and House Of The Dead. House of the Dead for me was a truly painful experience and Alone in the Dark, although better, still felt like eating a sloppy turd (dont ask me how i know what eating a sloppy turd feels like...) I watched this film because of mainly 2 reasons: 1 - To see if Uwe can get redemption from his earlier game to film adaptation.\n\n2 - I am a big film fan, and like the vampire / horror genre.\n\nThe film is purely awful from start to finish. The only good thing I can possibly think of is that the cast is definitely impressive for a film of this caliber. Michael Madsen, a legend of cult cinema, sways his way through the film swinging a sword like he's drunk. Ben Kingsly mumbles about as if he's simply bored. Kristanna Loken looks beautiful but doesn;t carry the furiosity of Rayne....and therefore simply doesn't create a sense of believability. Michelle Roudriguez looks as if she'd rather be doing some porn film and Meat Loaf just seems to be on aboard for the opportunity to lounge around in a room full of prostitutes.\n\nThe sword fighting / battle scenes on show are beyond disgrace. There was obviously no choreography involved and the actors / actresses clearly didn't have the time to be put into training sessions. The sets and wardrobe all feel like castouts from Harry Potter or Lord Of The Rings.\n\nThere is a sex scene involving the beautiful Kristanna Loken and some Matt guy....instead of increasing a romantic sub plot, tension or signs of \"human emotion\" within Rayne...the scene simply feels like a seqence from a porn film has been lifted into the film.\n\nAll in all the only praise I can give this film is that it finally ended. Only go to see this film if you are desperate to see Kristanna's breasts as she humps a guy against a cage wall."

The biggest one I can recall was Ishtar, but this steaming pile of excrement from Uwe Boll takes the proverbial cake.\n\nThis thing should never have been released to the theaters, but gone straight to SciFi's Saturday Night lineup, or maybe USA's Up All Night. I felt that I was trapped in Mystery Science Theater 3000 watching a horrible movie. Luckily for me (unlucky for her) I had my wife with me. After about half and hour we gave up on groaning under our breath about how terrible that scene was, or that effect, or the dialog, and we just flat out started heckling the movie. I suppose we offended the other movie patrons, but it was hard to tell, as the other couple there was making out and never seemed to come up for air, while the one other guy there was on his cell phone the entire time (likely calling all his friends warning them about the movie).\n\nI actually enjoy a number of campy B Movies, I'm a fan of most of the Troma Films myself, but to take a good video game with a strong story and utterly destroy it with terrible directing, dialog that seemed written for and performed by grade school children (my 4 year old's preschool talent show was more entertaining) and craptacular editing should be criminal.\n\nI can only hope that Uwe Boll loses enough money on this venture to prevent him from ruining other video game based movies."

        "review_detailed_main": "The masochist in me has taken over and I've decided to sit through three movies from IMDb's Bottom 100 in a row to see if this kind of activity can cause permanent brain damage. My first stop is \"Bloodrayne\", Uwe Boll's third video game adaptation and, impressively, his least entertaining, interesting and fun movie so far. Whereas \"House of the Dead\" was so bad it had its moments of unintentional comedy, and \"Alone in the Dark\" was simply too empty and forgettable to count among the all-time worsts, \"Bloodrayne\" made me seriously consider killing myself before I had come half-way through. Why do I loathe this movie? Let me count the ways:\n\nDirection: Truly mind-bogglingly sloppy and dull. Boll outdoes himself with constantly out of place camera angles and really unexciting action scenes. He's not called the modern day Ed Wood for nothing.\n\nThe actors: This is the biggest and most talented cast Boll has managed to bribe into one of his films so far. Michael Madsen, Udo Kier, Ben Kingsley and Kristanna Loken are just some of the people who have been hired to humiliate themselves this time. Madsen tries but he really only puts as much effort into his role as the script deserves - meaning, not very much. Udo Kier does his best comical evil-Russian-mind-controller \u00e1 la \"Yuri's Revenge\" impression - too bad the film actually tries to be serious. Ben Kingsley is so monotonous it's clear he has nothing but contempt for the film - but what intelligent actor wouldn't? Loken... well, Loken looks good and acts bad, although I didn't expect much else. Some of the supporting actors are so unbelievably awful you don't know whether to laugh or cry.\n\nThe story: Not even worth mentioning. So I won't.\n\nThe musical score: Generic and overbearing, loud and completely out of sync with the scenes most of the time. Slapped on to the film by Boll not to enhance the film but because films are supposed to have one.\n\nThe effects: Very funny in an over-the-top kind of way, but certainly not scary. The guy who gets split in half is a laugh riot.\n\nThe film's main problem is that for all its idiotic dialogue and laughable acting it simply isn't entertaining enough. It's one of the dullest movies I've watched in a long time and before the 1 hour mark I guarantee you that you'll be bored halfway into a coma. Oh, and could the nonsensical, out of place sex scene be any *less* erotic, because I don't think I was quite bored enough at this point!\n\nIn conclusion: It's truly \"worthy\" of being in the Bottom 100. How fitting that the first vampire movie Boll makes is the one that sucks the most. My next stop in this marathon is the 1990 superhero movie \"Captain America\". Pray for my sanity."

The plot was one dimensional allowing no character development. The dialogue was elementary. The action was hack/slash just so they could spray fake blood, even the sword fights were horrible- they didn't even try. The ending made no sense. From a pure movie making point of view, there weren't even any really good cinematic shots; the clothing looked like it was purchased from a replica catalog's mistakes; and the sets were uninspired. With the cast this boasted, I was expecting much more than it delivered. Will I see other Uwe Boll movies? Yes, but I will wait for the DVD rental."

He also wont have to worry his head about special effects and might even spend the same amount on the porn stars as for the bigger stars. As soon as this movie picks up (which is not very often) it lasts for a few minutes an then gets dragged back down by some nonsense Uwe Boll decided to add. The reason his movie got a 4 is because the level of crap in it had me laughing so hard i couldn't rate it lower. if u want to laugh or watch a good comedy then this is one of the best movies that u can choose. I wanted to demand the video store for my money back and am personally glad that the Halo movie went to Peter Jackson (director of the lord of the rings trilogy) an not this thing that claims to be a director. how does he get any fans anyway. and who sponsors his movies anyway, it can only be people with no good movie tastes or people that only want to laugh more at his trash he calls movies. if u see this movie then u must agree with me. if not then don't rent or buy it, trust me its utter garbage"

The battle scenes are funny. the actors/actresses know nothing about sword use, they are not hitting, they are caressing each other.

No video game can ever be as good as Resident Evil and I think people are expecting it to be....Just watch it for what it is a great movie that is based off a great video game. Not every movie has to be a Hollywood style movie. Hell I liked it so much I even got the tattoo of the bloodrayne symbol.\n\nKEEP ROCKING....YOU GUYS ARE DOING A GREAT JOB."

In Underworld it's the same, but that one contained a lot of CGI and had a lot of money. But the fact that CGI doesn't work makes it sometimes boring although it is a good movie. Bloodrayne also has some real 'declined' good actors. The storyline is as always the same but what makes this movie hateful or adorable is the amount of gore in it. And as I watched closely I noticed that Olaf Ittenbach was involved. The master of gore himself. Some killings or slaughterings are not for the squeamish and that's the main reason that people are hating this flick. But if you love vampires and gore than your in for a good flick, I just can't believe that it has a 2,4 on the scale. That was also one of the reasons that I never watched it earlier but it was one of those days that you feel you have to give it a try. I was not disappointed. It has an open end, and there is now Bloodrayne 2 available. Let's hope the gore stays intact. It's a one of his kind to see really good and well known (Ben Kingsley, Udo Kier) actors in this nice flick. So be it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Before you decide to watch \"BloodRayne\", there are a few things you might want to consider. First, it's a based on a videogame and these sorts of things are notoriously awful. Think about it...what GOOD videogame movies can you think of off the top of your head?! But bad ones....\"Super Mario Brothers\" and \"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation\" probably come to mind. So, it's not surprising that \"BloodRayne\" is now #27 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list. And, if neither of these convince you it's crap...it was directed by Uwe Boll. Boll has made a career out of making crappy films about videogames, with such classics as \"Far Cry\", \"Alone in the Dark\" and \"House of the Dead\" to his credits. Surely, the man can take the barest of plots and convert them into long, bloated films!\n\nThe film begins with a vampire woman being held like an animal at some sort of freak show where she is tormented. Eventually, however, she escapes and, inexplicably, joins up with a group of vampire slayers(???) to kill the man who apparently raped and killed her mother long ago. Vampires teaming up with vampire slayers?! That's like expecting Donald Trump and Nancy Pelosi to team up for a buddy picture!! They explain that BloodRayne is different...she is a vampire who lives to kill vampires! That's because she's a half-vampire! If this sort of thing makes no sense, don't blame this film...vampire lore is constantly changing these days. Try reading a few recent vampire novels and you'll see what I mean....as now, many can go out in daylight, some are born vampires, some sparkle, BloodRayne can wear a crucifix and much more.\n\nSo is this any good? Well, it looks nice...and this isn't surprising because Boll loves to spend money to make big and nice looking films. Also, it has a few respectable actors in it...another Boll touch. Michael Madsen, Ben Kingsley and Geraldine Chaplin both prove that with enough money, an actor with a good reputation is willing to undermine it a bit. As for Meatloaf....well...Mr. Loaf is in the film as well.\n\nSo why all the hate...as well as the abysmal current score of 2.9? Well, much of it is because there is so much fighting...it is numbing. Another issue is the dialog, which at times is pretty limp. I think it's also a bit dull and not fun to watch. But, I would argue that there at least are worse videogame-based films. It's not as bad as \"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation\" nor \"Super Mario Brothers\"....hardly a glowing endorsement, but it wasn't quite as bad as I'd anticipated. I think much of it's low score is because the film lost so much money AND because Boll's name is pretty much synonymous with the word 'sucks'."

        "review_detailed_main": "I tried. I really did, but just no. Couldn't find a good thing about it really.\n\n1. Wardrobe: Cheap leathers, dress-up type wigs, really fake fake blood, dull and obvious prop blades, phony vampire fangs and why is Rayne's outfit made of muted and loose leather? O_o I don't give a care what the year is! Skintight PVC is the only way to go! If her butt isn't shiny, then what the hell is it!? 2. Voice acting wasn't convincing and neither was the lip-syncing at times. 3. A better cast could've been obtained if a better director had taken the job. 4. The sets were sparsely furnished, cheap and the background effects didn't flow into a form of realism. 5. No deep character development which is necessary for any movie that's based off another form of media (like a video game). This movie would've been better if you didn't have to know the history of the game to understand what was going on. 6. Terrible script. It often tried too hard to use words that didn't belong and left me flabbergasted when they used ones that needed to be replaced in the most obvious of manners. \"The sunsets set the sky on fire.\" Give me a break. How about... \"The setting sun sends the night sky into a blazing inferno of majestic beauty.\" A bit over the top, yes, but so are a lot of aspects of the movie. 7. Question. Why does Rayne have a borderline English accent? She seems more east-coast attitude in the game. Just because they're in ancient times, doesn't mean they have to warp her personality to match the archaic theme. The spunk and fire she holds via game would've worked in an interesting why if it had been kept for the film. She's too soft-spoken and almost genial which doesn't seem right. 8. As expected in an Uwe Boll picture, there were quite a few editing flaws. How do Rayne's blades magically appear on the ground after a swing from a creature when they were not heard clattering to the stone floor and she had been using them to inspect his necklace only a moment before the attack? Ah, movie magic. 9. My god. The fight scenes are atrocious. Way too much blood, gore and guts for this sort of movie. Now me, I'm a huge fan of over the top blood spray, gutted bodies dangling from the ceiling and heads rolling around a courtyard but only in the right film. Battle Royale, tastefully over the top in an amusing way; Bloodrayne, blood bath in a tub made entirely of excrement (i.e. the gore was crappy). Of course that's expected from a bad zombie film director. 10. Since when was Bloodrayne about harems of beautiful love slave women and jiggling boobies!? Oh wait... Juggy mode does come to mind... But still, it seemed so out of place to have that much smut laced in with an otherwise violence-based video game turned movie. 11. The ending was left with absolutely nothing. Not even a final dialog from Rayne's point of view which would've went well with her series of flashbacks. This man has no vision. 12. Uwe Boll. What more needs to be said?"

However there is also something about various body parts which give vampires power and so on. (Ben Kingsley is the head honcho vampire who looks not like the Oscar winner but more like a robotic clone) Bloodrayne comes together with a cast list that admittedly sounds pretty cool. You have a great cast however Uwe Boll directs them with such ridiculous circumstance that you can see the sweat of embarrassment slide down their brows. Michael Pare has 3 minutes of screen time and looks as if he was trying to audition for the Three Dog Night story, Michael Madsen looks oddly like Howard Stern without the wrinkles and frighteningly enough is Meat Loaf who looks as if he was paying tribute to the Rock Me Amadeus video. What is even more shocking is that this is all boring. You would think that any movie that the actors I had just listed would contribute to non-stop hilarity but sadly it doesn't. Worst of all is the end which for some reason goes into a long flashback depicting what Rayne has seen. It is as if Boll was afraid that audiences had forwarded to the climax and so he decided to sting us with what he missed. It is a mess to behold since things make no sense and the movie is just so terminally boring. Boll should probably stick to making porn at least there his confusing camera angles and lack of coherent story telling would be ignored by viewers looking to satisfy their uh, needs. However given the sex scene in this movie and the one in Alone In The Dark, one assumes that even porno is out of his league.\n\n* out of 4-(Bad)"

It was like they read every single word, word for word.. \"I will take that\" instead of \"I'll take that\". It was like they were reading them word for word off a cue card.\n\ni don't follow this director much, don't know much about him, but from what everyone else's says this is pretty much the way all his movies are. its really not a bad movie, it just had flaws.

Not to mention his delivery reminded me of an emotionless Data played by Brent Spiner on Star Trek. Like Data, Madsen appears incapable of using conjunctions when he speaks.\n\nI find it hard to believe that such an awful performance could go unnoticed by the casting director, the director, other cast members, Madsen himself, and anyone else who happened to be present while Michael destroyed every scene he was in. This may sound harsh, but his performance is so bad I suggest you watch this movie just to see it first hand. It's like passing by a bad car accident on your way to work, you don't want to look, but you just can't look away.\n\nIn short, Madsen's performance made a bad movie worse."

        "review_title": "Calling Out Uwe Boll",
        "review_detailed_main": "Uwe Boll recently challenged his critics to a boxing match to put an end to all the bad things said about his films (which inspired me to review his films here). Doesn't resorting to fists sort of admit defeat on the intellectual level? I've got a more appropriate challenge in mind: a bout, not with fists but with cameras. I'm calling out Uwe Boll. Each challenger gets a small budget, a camera, a crew, and a short time to make a short film. When the films are completed they are both presented to the judging panel at Cannes. May the best director win. I'm not worried, because I know I could make a better film than any of the Boll films I've seen (for all I know \"Blackwoods\" will be \"Citizen Kane\", but I doubt it).\n\nNothing boosts my confidence better than a film as depressingly bad as \"BloodRayne\". Before you notice Boll's name, the others give you hope for the potential: Guinevere Turner (\"American Psycho\", \"The L Word\"), Ben Kingsley, Billy Zane, Udo Kier, Michael Madsen\u0085 and for some Michelle Rodriguez and Kristina Loken. Once again, the source is a game, resulting in the usual lame plots and outfits, but this is not always the kiss of death. I'd like to think that Turner's script was probably a pretty solid piece of writing to start with\u0085 So, it's the middle ages again and humans have a big problem with vampires. Gandhi plays Kagan, King of the Vampires and father (by way of rape, so say the flashbacks) of Rayne (Loken), a half vampire (like \"Blade\"), which are called dhampirs in this film's universe. Sebastian and Vladamir (Davis and Madsen) are vampire hunters on Rayne's trail after she escapes from the circus. Meanwhile she's collecting body parts from a dead vampire, which Kingsley also needs for some kind of vampire supremacy and to walk in daylight (like \"Blade\"). Anyhow, the vampire hunters and the half-vampire join forces and set out on a quest to defeat the king of the vampires.\n\nSo, what could possibly go wrong with that? For one, a budget of $25 million. Some incredible things can be done on a small budget, just look at the films of Scorsese (especially \"Last Temptation\"), George Miller, Joe Carnahan, or even Samuel Fuller. Unfortunately, Uwe Boll's name does not belong with the others. Yes, this film was shot on location in Romania, using real castles and helicopter shots. The trouble is that Boll's inept camera makes the locations look fake and the helicopter shots aren't enough to create that epic feel they were trying for. Meanwhile the tasteless dungeon sex scene and the excessive gore (especially in the last five minutes of the director's cut) remind us that this is exploitation. Exploitation dressed up in CG, millions of dollars, star cameos, and Romanian castles is almost worse because it could have been something more. That is, it could have been something more if not for Uwe Boll.\n\nNot only did this DVD have Boll's usual sad commentary (this time joined by Loken and friends), but it also had a feature called \"Dinner with Uwe Boll\" which is Boll eating dinner with a couple in their dining room and talking about how he got into film. I found it very telling that Boll said he dropped out of film school because of all the theory and the \"talking, talking, talking\". Yes, sir Mr. Boll, your genius is evident. I'll be standing by to sing my praise for \"In The Name of the King\", \"Seed\", \"Postal\", \"Far Cry\", and whatever other video game movies you manage to churn out before Germany abolishes the tax shelter and the investors desert you."

        "review_detailed_main": "Curious about the man often referred to as the modern day Edward Wood Jr., my friends and I decided to watch our first Uwe Boll movie. Unfortunately, the only one I could get for a dollar was BloodRayne II, and one of my friends objected to watching a sequel without having seen the original, so he went to Blockbuster to rent the first one. Three hours of incompetence is far too much, as you must imagine. The first one doesn't, in fact, rank as one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's poor, to be sure, but there was enough cleavage and gory violence to keep at least the juvenile part of my mind (a huge part of my total mind, to be perfectly honest!) engaged. BloodRayne is a Medieval action movie about a half vampire gal (Kristen Loken, from Terminator 3) looking to kill her father (Ben Kingsley), the vampire ruler who raped and killed her mother. She joins up with a secret society whose purpose it is to exterminate vampires (led by Michael Madsen, Matt Davis and Michelle Rodriguez). Also in this far too accomplished cast are Billy Zane, Udo Kier, Geraldine Chaplin and Meat Loaf (credited as \"Meatloaf Aday\"). As with most of Uwe Boll's movies, this one is based on a video game. But apparently he or the studio or the screenwriter or whoever decided that the game's fans, the only ones who would probably be interested in seeing the movie anyway, weren't worth pleasing, because the games take place in like the 1940s or something (the little bit I saw of it had cars, anyway), and this one takes place in Medieval times, I guess because the time period is hot or something because of the Lord of the Rings movies. The whole movie seems lazy. The look on every actor's face is that one that says, \"Give me my paycheck!\" Sometimes they attempt a British-sounding accent, but that comes and goes. It doesn't look at all like the film had an action choreographer. The violence during the action sequences is delightfully nasty. If you can giggle at poorly done decapitations and dismemberment, those parts of the movie are moderately fun. But much of the film just has the characters standing around talking, and it gets really boring."

But this is a perfectly fine action-horror hybrid with a great cast and some sweet practical gore effects from Olaf Ittenbach of Black Past and The Burning Moon. This aired on the Sci Fi channel a lot back in the day and it was just as good if not better than the usual original movies they were putting out at the time.\n\nSide note: Billy Zane and Meat Loaf are here in very limited roles, but both manage to sport some of the worst hilarious wigs ever committed to film."

And all this led up to one of the worst endings I've ever seen. I feel my intelligence has been insulted that the cast and crew felt this film was suitable for viewing. Somewhere someone in the production of this film should have said lets rethink this one. For this film to be based on a pretty good game, they should have come up with a better plot. I'll never see anything from this director again. I want a refund."

I liked the video game, so I treated this movie like a video game and it helped a little. You can tell the actors gave their all, but this is a prime example of how post production can go awry. I hope they don't attempt to make a sequel, as they normally do with garbage.\n\nIn short, if you like the video game you'll hate the movie. Don't watch this movie at all.

I have been reading other comments made about this movie. i figured this movie couldn't be that bad, but it is. there is like twenty minuets of horseback riding scattered threw out the movie. i almost turned it off. But i had wanted to see this for a while so i gave it a chance. Can someone tell me what happened at the end??? the movie kinda just stopped. it was like watching an episode of Seinfeld. only this is two hours about nothing. i blame the writers mostly. I've never seen any other EWE boll(what kind of name is that?)movies. but i heard they suck. so screw the guy. I'm a big fan of the video games and hopefully in about 10 years somebody does to Bloodrayne what the did for batman. Make a hole new story and movie, but until that day, stop Boll and his writers from destroying video game based movies."

I felt that Boll did a horrendous job explaining several points of the plot, such as why Kagan needs the parts of Belial. The special effects were nothing special, and in places they were downright campy (especially the incredibly fake death of the guardian of the eye).\n\nWhile watching this movie, I shed a silent tear for Michelle Rodriguez, Bill Kingsley, Billy Zane, and some of the other actors who, if given a decent script, could have made this movie good, maybe even great. Who knows? It's not their fault.\n\nThat being said, the movie could probably have done well, had it been written more sensibly and directed by someone with some actual talent.

The lead character that played Rayne was perfect for the part. The rest of the cast were top notch actors in their own right. But when the director is not sure what they want or how to either convey that thought or get the cast \"into the part\", then Bloodrayne is the result. The fight scenes rambled on and didn't do much to add to the over all movie experience. The movie looks low budget, as if it were filmed in a few days."

'Alone in the Dark', but nevertheless, I really enjoyed his 'BloodRayne', and it kept me entertained all the way through. The film was filled with action and a straight story, okay acting and wonderful bloody B-movie action.\n\nMy only catch with the film, is the lack of character development. You don't get much time to get to know the individual characters, which is a shame because the story is a wonderful and DARK adventure. Kristanna Loken is a great actress, and she looks marvelous and sexy as the vengeful Rayne.\n\nI've seen a lot of films in my life, and believe me when I say that there is much more worse films on the market than 'BloodRayne', ex. 'Aeon Flux', 'Van Helsing' and 'Catwoman'. What makes 'BloodRayne' so good is among others the dark atmosphere, some well placed horror, not too much CGI, NO irritating one liners and great bloody B-movie effects. Maybe Uwe Boll's film-making is not the best, but believe when I say that 'BloodRayne' has got much more beating that it has deserved."

If you have the patience to watch it all the way through to the end (and I suggest having something else to do on the side to ease the pain) you'll just find yourself confused. Who is the lead character? Who is the bad guy? What era is this colossally bad flick supposed to be taking place in? And most importantly, who designed the women's costumes? It's early goth meets \"I'm having a fat day\" clothing. What a mess! The only redeeming thing about this is that there are some great actors in it doing a really bad job. How is this redeeming? Well, because I have a sick sense of humour and it makes me feel kinda good to know that the extraordinary Ben Kingsley and always amusing Michael Madsen do crappy work too. Perhaps they needed to pay for the summer home, buy another horse... who knows? But nobody chose this puppy for the script.\n\nIf you get bored watching the film (and you will) a fun way to pass the time is to try and figure out what accent Michelle Rodriguez is attempting. She varies from sounding like a 100% west coast American to a tape player with the batteries running out.\n\nThis is fun to watch with people who like to heckle. And while drinking.

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a review of the DVD version.\n\nBasically it's a tale of Bloodrayne, a dhampir (half-human, half vampire, popularized by Blade, but actually a real legend, albeit in real folklore they could just sense vampires, they didn't have superhuman strength) who basically wants revenge on her vampire father, Ben Kingsly. She's being pursued by the forces of her father, along with a trio of vampire hunters headed by Michael Madsen and Michelle Rodriguez, who she eventually joins forces with.\n\nIt's set in the 16th Century, but is hardly historically accurate (and as an adaption of a video game, it was hardly meant to be). The movie is rather jerky, in that it doesn't transition smoothly from scene to scene, but there are leaps in what's going on. Little to no characterization, either. In a way, it reminds me a lot of Tsui Hark's movies. And like his movies, this movie actually looks very nice, cinematographically. Some really vivid colors, landscapes, etc.\n\nThere's quite a bit of fighting scenes and quite a bit of gore, but the fighting is all very fake looking.\n\nOn the surface the cast is pretty decent, but Michelle Rodriguez is the only one who actually acts or at least, takes it seriously. The lead actress seems to be a female version of Keanu Reeves - she has two expressions - confused and blank. Michael Madsen just is hard to take serious in a role like this. Meat Loaf looked like he had fun, mostly he just rolled about and fondled a gaggle of Romanian prostitutes, which I guess would be enjoyable.\n\nIt's not a terrible movie, just a fairly standard B movie. Not unlike something put out by Hammer studios in the early 70s, combined with the sword & sorcery movies of the early 80s. Possibly worth a rental if you are into such movies, but definitely not worth buying."

The dialogue was 1 of the most terrible dialogues that i was ever suffered to sit thru. I wanted 2 jam a scissors in my eardrum! Worst of all was Meatloaf's terrible acting (if u can even call this crap that). Ben Kingsley was also terrible and wooden. The only semi-passable acting was from Kristanna Loken who plays Rayne and thats not saying much! This brings me 2 another topic. The random sex scene. Rayne wakes up and has sex with Matt Davis against a jail cell. It had nothing 2 do with the crappy plot at all. BTW this was by far the most realistic part of the movie. From this scene, we can tell that Toilet.. I mean Uwe Boll was desperate 2 make a quick buck because he knew that his newest and greatest crapfest would not make much money at all. So finally, I must tell u that if u see this piece of junkola, wipe your feet on it or throw it in the dumpster as quickly as possible or in the Toilet Boll. And will sum1 stop Bowl from making these crappy movies and ruining great game franchises. Stop making movies Boll! They suck!!!!!! Well folks this is the end of this tragic review.

The fighting scenes are not very good, but that's the way they are in almost all movies. The bad characters are generally mildly evil, not diabolically evil. The good characters have their weaknesses and tend to die in the fights. Those are rather good points too.\n\nI heard in one of the scenes the half-naked women around Leonid (Meat Loaf), were real prostitutes as they were cheaper to hire than real actresses. Well, I think they were more suited for that role than actresses, I couldn't tell the difference.\n\nI watched it on TV and I felt quite entertained.

Now, my expectations have been low for video game movies since the likes of Mario Bros and Doom. But this didn't even meet my low expectations. The use of gore didn't seem to have any other purpose other than to be there which... if this were some sort of horror flick... would have been fine. But it just seemed laughable. As in me and my family were laughing. It looked ridiculous. The problem is it's not even bad enough to be good. it's not a so bad it's good. or so indie it's good. this is a movie that is so bad it's horrendous. don't even waste your money.\n\nthat's three strike Mr. Boll. in my books... you're out.

        "review_detailed_main": "Please forgive me for the harsh review, but you will understand this if you are fan of the game or good movies in general. This movie receives a 1 out of 10 from me for the following:\n\n1) Storyline, plot, and characterizations of Rayne, Kagan, and the Brimstone society were poorly done. For being a prequel, this movie really did lose any sense of what the video-games were about. If the writer would have played the games, got an understanding of what Bloodrayne was about, then the background information and plot would have been more correctly told and portrayed. The plot was not well-put together. The story should have stayed near the consistency with the game, not trying to make a prequel. I feel that was a bad part in the first place.\n\n2) Actor portrayals of the characters were NOT convincing. The actors/actresses really seem to be acting half-heartedly. Upon reviewing the characters and the actors/actresses portraying them, I feel that the casting was not right. Even though I am fan of the actors/actresses in this film, I just don't feel this was a good film with some of their previous roles that they have engaged in. Brings a good question, how did Uwe Boll get some of these well-known actors/actresses to act in his films? The point is the casting could have been better. Rayne should have oozed with sensuality, with the confidence of a trained assassin, like Selena in Underworld or Alice from Resident Evil. Both characters were portrayed with a confidence, Kate Beckinsale and Milla Jovovich making the roles as believable as they could. Each word said, each punch punched, each gun fired, every blade swung, looked and felt real or believable. This film needed that...it felt like Kristanna Loken was holding back and unsure of herself.\n\n3) The lighting and camera angles in this film was consistent with Uwe Boll's other films. This is very unfortunate, as the setting and plot are completely stripped away of any effect that could have been created. For example, would Underworld have been such a good movie if it was all done with bright hues and showing characters in sunlight, brightly lit rooms, etc? No, the movie was supposed to be dark and broody, gave the sense of eeriness and the supernatural. This sets up the mood, makes the characters dark and mysterious, makes the costumes appear more sensual or realistic. The cinematographer should have known that or tried to achieve that. But, it's not entirely his fault as the director should have been pushing that more. ~sigh~ This should have been a SCI-FI channel movie, instead of a theatrical affair.\n\n4) The props and action scenes in this movie would have been done better by a high school drama club. Aluminum swords, costumes not even worthy to be able a comic-book convention, and over use of nudity, bloody, and gore really took away from making this convincing. It was so disconcerting. Point of a good movie is to make the audience feel they are part of the movie, bringing to life another world. The action scenes focused entirely on the blood and gore, Kristanna Loken and the others looked unconvincing in any the scenes. The choreography was not even second-rate, it was one of the worst. ( With the exception of the unknown-monk in a particular scene that really knew what he was doing.) Other than that, it's the usual Uwe Boll style of emphasizing on blood and gore and not enough on the story, plot, and connecting the action scenes together properly.\n\n5) The music in this movie was not bad, but the music NEVER stopped or felt were scored or unneeded in a scene. Even my friends and family that watched this movie was aggravated at the music was nonstop and commenting on how the music just didn't fit the mood of the scenes.\n\n6) The death knell of any future movie franchises for Bloodrayne. With a character that could rival Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Blade, this could have been a very successful franchise for Majesco and the studio that produced this film. Such a disappointment that this will more than likely end any future endeavors that Bloodrayne could have had. Majesco should have held off and did their research, for example, Blizzard Entertainment recently found a studio for their product Warcraft. Warcraft has been around for nearly 10 or so years. It has taken Blizzard that long to find the correct studio they feel will do their product justice. I guarantee you that the Warcraft movie will be very well-done, making the Warcraft franchise even bigger and open up to future films. This should have been the case for Bloodrayne, but sadly...\n\nI am a big fan of good cult-cheese movies, like Army of Darkness or Killer Klownz from Outer Space. This is doesn't even qualify as good cheese...it was that disappointing.\n\nOut of my enjoyment of the game was the only reason I forced myself to watch this. Play the game, enjoy the story, the characterizations in the game are great. Just this video-game-made-movie, even in terms of a regular movie, was not worth the time that I spent watching."

Story is misleading from what's it's supposed to be(and it's not all about the Nazis, there are Bloodrayne 2 as well, for those not knowing). The movie is basically effect-less considering in the Game, Bloodrayne, would be practically \"Invincible\". In the movie, My Granny could bet Bloodrayne. No Blood magic/powers is used in the movie, it's like U Boll, never actually seen or heard about the game. Bloodrayne should be a half Vamp, that would be overpowered, highly agile(no high jumping in movie, or scaling of any sort), able to control the magic or potence of the blood, for using it's power. Etc. There is a unlimited number of things that isn't as it should in the movie. The costume however, is similar(sorta, alike, but not totally) The scenery and the era is about right tho, so no complaints there. In all, this movie is a bottom-scraper. Simply because, 1. No alike the game characteristics. 2.Effectless and motionless. 3. Bad acting(probably because of scripting and directing etc).\n\nThe movie do how ever have good scenery though. Good actors, though wrong movie. Someone mentioned that of Rayne would die if in touch of water. Well, in some stories, if looking up on vampiric history, there would be tales of the waters around the world would be \"blessed\" so that fiends not of this world would have more, shall we say \"problems\" to go about? Anyhow, this is how the game was made, vampires getting damaged by water, to make it more difficult for the gamer to get around, as there would be multiple water obstacles for him or her to get around. So there is the answer to that."

We all know that movies based on games always make good movies, right? Well, it holds true this time also. This movie sucks like a hoover.\n\nUwe Boll isn't know for any big master pieces and this movie isn't one. The dialogue is uninspired and full of clich\u00e9s; \"Keep your friends close and your enemies closer\" and other stuff like that is delivered time and time again. There are also a few sword fights in this movie, but the less said about them the better. They are poorly choreographed, the actors just throw around their weapons with no force behind them and it's just not believable. What you do get is blood, lots of it and in close up. Doesn't make the movie any better though.\n\nActually I won't bother writing any more about this movie. The only positive thing with the movie is the looks of Kristanna and Michelle, but they can't save this \u00fcber turkey.\n\nVherna rating: Stay away!"

I will probably regret that day for a long time, and to say the least, I was forced to question my taste in friends. Little did I know that I would stumble upon this movie, unsuspecting and oblivious to its director.\n\nI will say one thing for Uwe Boll. His name should be on the front image of every single one of his movies' DVD releases. In bold. Probably in some kind of neon color. Maybe twice, just to make sure.\n\nThis movie is just bad on so many levels. If you are looking for Tarantino-ish amounts of blood, look no further. But where Tarantino manages to overdose on the gore in a manner that makes you hoarse with laughter, Boll manages to actually make you want to curl up and cry yourself to sleep. The sheer terror.\n\nAnd the bad acting. Boll persistently manages to get big names to work on his films. The warm, lovable, peaceful image of Ben Kingsley as Ghandi will forever be tainted by his utter lack of facial muscles and the offensively bad hair styling in Bloodrayne.\n\nThe bad lines. \"You are such a suck-up!\" Do I really need to say more? The movie tries (and, unsurprisingly, fails) to carry its lines in a cloak&dagger-ish manner, to be repeatedly interrupted by comments like the one mentioned. This even beats Ultraviolet's \"Are you mental?\".\n\nIn a world of great injustice, of people dying by the thousands each moment, of a cloned human as the leader of one of its most powerful nations, and a tradition of blaming violence on video games and rock music, Uwe Boll will be allowed to continue to make awful movies. But maybe, just maybe, IMDb will implement the option of giving a movie a negative rating."

        "review_detailed_main": "Uwe Boll has made some of the worst video game adaptations ever. Most of his movies are effortless, cynical, nihilistic cash-grabs. Although you could argue the same applies to Bloodrayne, it has become one of my all-time favorite bad movies.\n\nHow is Bloodrayne any different from House of the Dead? How come I can't stomach that film, but want to watch this one over and over again? The answer is in the acting. Bloodrayne has a number of famous actors. Does this mean the acting is good? No. But it's not bad either. It's terrible! The performances of all the actors turn Bloodrayne into a true trainwreck of a film: it's so terrible you can't avert your eyes.\n\nOscar winner Ben Kingsley speaks in an eloquent, Shakespearian monotone. I've never seen such a bizarre performance, before or since. Michael Madsen convincingly portrays a man slowly dying of boredom. Michelle Rodriguez's British accent is so bad that even she is pissed about it. Kristanna Loken, veteran of Mortal Kombat Conquest, exhausts all of her acting chops on moaning. Billy Zane delivers some of the hammiest snooty acting I've ever seen, and I love it. Meat Loaf is truly a horror to behold, in every possible way.\n\nThe rest of the movie is firmly within SyFy Channel Original movie territory. The CGI and practical effects are terrible despite the Hollywood budget. The costumes could easily have been stolen from the closets of trendy cosplayers of the early 2000s. Romania affords one or two interesting film locations, but most of this looks like a TV set.\n\nI highly recommend Bloodrayne to fans of movies like the Room. If you see it, it will be very hard to forget!"

But this is definitely up there with the Lost boys and an interview with a vampire. But I think it depends on what you like if you like all kinds of vampire films then you're going to love this one. But if you only like vampire films all about love then no probably not for you but still absolute brilliant film surprisingly! It may be a little bit more appealing to female vampire fans and it probably would mail vampire fans even though the actor is absolutely gorgeous due to the type of film it is and it's not all about romance It's definitely better than Twilight, but do you think you have to be a proper vampire fan to either get it and love it \ud83d\udc95"

People think that Uwe does not care about who he casts, but A King's Tale is another story. But back to Bloodrayne, the cast was fair. Michael Madsen if an alright actor. Bin Kinglsey does not really strike my fancy. The best was character was Kristanna. I'm am actually looking forward to A King's Tale."

This movie is such a strange mix with a recognizable cast (Billy Zane, Michelle Rodriguez, Ben Kingsley, Matthew Davis), basic vampire gore, and bad CGI. The fight scenes are underwhelming, especially given the sheer badass character of Rayne in the video games. I'll stay hopeful that someday we'll get a BloodRayne film adaptation with a Resident Evil budget. Until then, I'll keep playing the games and pretending the sequels to this film don't exist."

        "review_detailed_main": "OK, So I thought I might be tired of stereotypes of vampires and stuff as I really live here and I still remember the hype in the local press that the great stars are comin down from Hollywood to shoot this movie. I don't have to tell that this cast is one of the best I have seen in these kinds of movies. So here is the general idea: Mr. Boll (avant-garde director extraordinare) wanted so much to make this movie, oh it was his childhood dream. Collected some of the most talented and acclaimed actors (and some opposite of that) and made this terrible film. But This is not even a film, because films have a plot, have actors. A plot is something that makes you at least stay awake, an actor is somebody who knows his/her role. I don't want to tell that fi. Maidsen isn't an actor, but he is playing this one worse than Steven Seagal usually plays, who would had been a better choice as having a practice in playing such horrible parts (And Maidsen proved he is a good actor as Mr. Blonde). The others, I don't even wan't to mention them, I truly don't want to think at some of my favorite actors as jerks in gigalol costumes. It really seems that they where so frustrated, they allied to make a complete joke out of their roles, or this is how they protested? I wonder how they where lured to star in this movie (a free trip to Romania?) Bottom line: How is he doing it? How can he get a contract for a movie? Who gives him money? Yes I'm referring to Mr. Boll. David Lynch is fighting for money to make genial movies and this little piece of s*it is getting money for great titles like Alone in the dark. The only logical explanation I could find is, that he is making video game based movies. You read in the papers that a horrible picture was made and it is a shame to the (also not genial) game. So you think if you wasted $10 for the ticket or the rental, you should really try the game only to find out it is better than this movie.\n\nSorry, I'm really diffuse here at the ending, but I can't concentrate. Recalling this movie had killed my brain-cells, I can't type... ...DON'T W.. H.AT..CH I.TTTTT! Ps: If you have a good sense of humor don't miss it, you will laugh for 90 minutes, but only if you have it!"

However one of the most humongous flaws in the movie was however the fact that it introduced new characters and settings all the freaking time!!! Every 5 minutes a new setting and about 10 different characters, that we could well do without! Other annoying aspects of the movie: I was trying to take Michelle Rodriguez's father's character seriously, believe me... I tried... However I failed miserably, but I'm pretty sure everyone else did as well, so I don't feel to sad about that fact.\n\nAnd what is with all the incredibly fake English accent's in the movie???

        "review_detailed_main": "Who knew Uwe Boll (who's name I always want to transpose with former Dallas Maverick center/bench warmer/useless stiff Uwe Blab) had so much in common with Malick. This is the third Boll film I've watched and it might be his best. At the very least it comes through in the grue factor. It's interesting to see so many actor's slumming it. Could there be that many actors with alimony checks due? At one point Michelle Rodriguez comes across a young woman who has been bitten by a vampire and calls for her vampire killing partners to come and see with a line reading that can only be classified as vaguely urgent. Everyone seems supremely disinterested, except perhaps the lead actress who just seems awkward. It does have geysers of blood, crushed heads and the such. So much so that it becomes boring. Uwe Boll is the best definition of deep hurting.\n\nDVD Note: They have a feature on the DVD called 'Dinner with Uwe.' A young man and woman sit and eat dinner while Uwe talks about his film career. The young man and woman are never introduced. The young woman says nothing until Uwe brings up 'Kentucky Fried Movie' at which point she enthusiastically states \"I love that movie!\" What an odd bonus feature. I turned it off after five minutes, to leave myself a small bit of mystery. Who are these Uwe dinner companions? And why do they hate movies so, so much?"

I didn't check IMDb ratings before pressing play.\n\nThere is so much wrong with this movie that I don't know where to begin, however I will have a stab...\n\nDialogue: From the opening scene, the dialogue just sounded wrong. We've all seen those foreign movies where the sentence structure just didn't work. This movie is the same. The lines just sounded so bad. One of the pieces of trivia says the cast re-wrote most of the lines and that is definitely believable.\n\nI kid you not, this was actually in a scene Actor 1: They are all dead Actor 2: Are there any survivors\n\nActing: the less said about this the better. Picture every single badly acted move scene you have ever seen, roll them all together and you will get a hint. All that is missing is an evil round of Ming The Merciless mwahahaaha laughter. Michelle Rodriguez plays her stereotypical angry young woman. She just has this natural angry demeanour about her.\n\nOutfit: usual game stuff. Lots of exposed flesh on Kristanna Loken and Michelle Rodriguez with not a lot of protection. Trousers hanging off the hips, wee crop tops with plunging necklines that wouldn't be out of place in an Ann Summers shop but definitely out of place in a pre-industrial movie. To be fair, the cleavage is usually the best thing in most scenes. Except the sex scene. That was so bad nothing could save it.\n\nWeapons: already mentioned in previous reviews, poor. My wee man's foam swords would not look out of place here. One guy actually grasps a sword by the blade when handed to him.\n\nWeapons that are in hand one second, then gone, then back again a second later. Not through magic, just really bad continuity.\n\nSomeone needs to show Michael Madsen how to use a whetstone.\n\nOne scene has a knife sinking in water, with the weight of the handle taking it down, rather than the blade. Foam floats \ud83d\ude00\n\nI'm going to leave it at this and try to find something better, like, zombie alien nazis."

I felt really bad for the actors involved: Ben Kingsley, Billy Zane (of Titanic for goodness sake!), and the buff Kristanna Loken (awesome knockers), who never could quite decide if her character should have an accent or not. At some point these actors must have realized Bloodrayne was not going to be the next Underworld or LOTR, as you can detect hints of personal discontent in many scenes. The Michelle Rodriquez character especially seems to scream, 'I don't want to be here reciting these stupid lines.' Meat Loaf, a camp movie mainstay, is the only actor who seems comfortably at home inside this wretched flick."

He, having been a huge fan of the video game was greatly disappointed by it. He said the movie was somewhat close to the story in the game, except for being set in a different time period and location, however the story line in the movie was completely lacking. It seemed that they tried to accommodate for this by putting a lot of unnecessary gore and nudity in it. Things seemed to be completely random. At one point it turned into a porno with a completely random sex scene which never had anything to do with the story. The fight scenes were terrible. The choreography wasn't impressive at all and because the camera flashed around so much it was extremely hard to see what was going on. Honestly, after this movie I think the director(Uwe Boll) shouldn't be doing anymore movies based on video games because so far he's done a horrible job. These movies have the potential to be awesome and he's turned them into complete crap. In my opinion, if you want to see a good vampire movie, wait for Underworld 2!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't know what the heck happened but Uwe Boll has at last turned out a watchable, even enjoyable movie. Sure its not a great film, or maybe even a good film, but for those of us raised on \"bad but fun\" fantasy films like Hawk the Slayer, Ator, Sword and the Sorcerer as well as countless others this is a return to the days of old.\n\nThe plot has Rayne, a half Human Half Vampire breaking out of a circus where she is being held and going after the vampire king who fathered her. She is pursued by some vampire hunters who think she can help them in their own battles.\n\nThe script is uneven, the direction just passable but there is something in this film that somehow pulls it all together.\n\nThe biggest problem is the acting, some of which is non existent. The problem is that Uwe Boll doesn't cast until he's days from shooting so he can get the biggest names he can find with holes in their schedules (and who want/need some fast cash). The result of this is unevenness of performances that make you feel as though everyone is in different movies. Its runs from Udo Keir who is actually giving a performance, Michael Madsen who thinks he's in a western, Billy Zane who is in a comedy and Ben Kingsley who is out acted by one of the worst hairpieces of all time. Kingsley obviously took this for cash or thought his roll was that of a piece of lumber.(Clearly he's in the running for worst performance by an Oscar winner from the last 25 years award) Still somehow this works. No, its not great, but it is an earnest attempt at a fantasy film (and its light years better than some of the recent films like Beasts of Blood that have cropped up in the wake of Lord of the Rings, not to mention other video game movies like Doom).\n\nIf you like this sort of thing I give it a try, on cable if nothing else. Its not the best, not worst, but if you've seen Hawk, or Ator or Gor, then you might find yourself liking it."

        "review_detailed_main": "I just saw this movie today, the day it opened in my locality. And although I liked it alright, it really is one of those movies chock full of \"well that's good but\" features.\n\nIf you like vampire movies of the modern, campy, pop type ... think of Vampire Lestrat, and Blade, and even Buffy the Vampire Killer ... then this move may appeal. I've liked Vampire movies and stories since childhood and although I prefer \"old school\" vampires (like Dracula) I do think the modern ones of this kind have a kind of cool appeal as well.\n\nThe cast includes some enormously capable actors: Ben Kingsley, Michael Madden, Michelle Rodriguez. They, and the entire cast, produced solid performances fitting their parts and the overall script ... but certainly nothing here really stretched their talents. The female lead, Kristianna Loken, is new to me, but she's an attractive actress and turned in a solid performance.\n\nThe sound and cinematography seemed to have some problems of a technical nature. Some of the speech was obscured or sounded hollow; some of the camera slides were uneven.\n\nSome of the scenes in the countryside were simply breathtaking. In fact, the whole flavor of horseback riding across these panoramic, wild, lush countrysides ... during daylight, during nighttime, during twilight ... all of this I liked very much indeed. Likewise I liked the castle(s), the monastery, the (fighting) monks, the boat that bore our heroes and heroines across the water ... these were all just delightfully lush, evocative ... the kind of scenes that just delight the heart of an old Medievalist like me. And the kinds of scenes that will thrill you as well if you like me are a Lord of the Rigns fan.\n\nThe general plot ... well ... is \"OK\" ... but this is the kind of movie that for myself I have a hard time caring about the Plot. The value of a Plot in some stories and movies to me is really just to provide a framework on which to depict wonderful moods and atmospherics and scenery and the delightful playing out of Myth of the Vampire. For this purpose the plot sufficed well.\n\nThere were several places during the action, though, in which the events were simply unconvincing. I won't give them away. And in a sort of high mythos or high legend movie like this, I'm certainly not in the least concerned with \"realism.\" But everything that happens should surely be convincingly in accord with the movie's internal logic. Several parts failed this test though.\n\nAll in all, a good rich campy vampire flick. Not bad for an evening's entertainment. But you know ... I can't help but wonder if something with the scale and quality of the Lord of the Rings or the Chroniclkes of Narnia or even Harry Potter could be developed out of the rich, decaying, earthy mythos of the Vampire? If so that's a movie I'd love to see! Till then, though, hey: BloodRayne is a decent, fun vampire flick."

I truly don't recommend you wasting your money on this one, movie ticket or rental. In fact, I wouldn't waste time getting it on netflix either, why would I want to waste my time receiving it and mailing it right back.\n\nThe fact that Ben Kingsley was in it might have given it some glimpse of redemption, but alas, he didn't come through. His performance was a tragic as the rest. The story seemed piece- meal and poorly constructed, even based on the video game.

They're relaxing and most of them amusing. Bloodrayne, sadly, is neither. I found myself unconsciously trying to cover my eyes with my hand, feeling embarrassed and genuinely sorry for the cast and crew - with the exception, of course, of Uwe Boll himself, who obviously likes this...\n\nI can't find a single redeeming feature in it. The story is ridiculous at best, and the costumes and wigs (oh, the wigs...) are made to match. The fight scenes are the worst I've seen (not kidding). We get to see vampire hunters Michael Madsen and Matthew Davis femininely tripping into battle like confused, overgrown ballerinas, and a number of identical chest wounds spray blood like lawn-sprinklers, while every single person involved - including the wounded - look like they just couldn't care less. I wanted to laugh, but just sat and stared in disbelief.\n\nAll in all, my advice is: Don't watch it. Go rent dear old \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" instead, because compared to this atrocity I'd give it the Academy Award. I myself will avoid the sequel(s) with fiery passion, and send the following prayer to any higher power: Please make any company considering giving Boll money for additional movies see reason!\n\nLike one or more commentators before me, I only wish \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" were still around.

        "review_detailed_main": "First off I am going to start my review by stating that I Don't HATE UWE BOLL and going into this movie I wasn't looking for every way to go OH MY BOLL YOU DID THAT WRONG! I went into this movie wanting to kill 90 minutes of my day. Now I saw this in its third week and I was the only one in the theater. Now this theater for American Films is never busy so one person there I would say is like 5 at a normal Loews or UA theater. So off to the review.\n\nI have been reading that people say the acting is terrible and all of that and the script is lousy. Well I don't think the acting is all that bad. Now its it Oscar. HELL NO! Is it even something a 5 yr old would go WOW thats good acting. HELL NO! This is just normal acting that Kingsley or a lesser known actor could have done, not a person off the street because its still acting. I think from other peoples reviews that the acting is under what people are saying.\n\nSecond topic is how the film is cut and edited, I will include the sex scene for this film. Since HOTD Boll has gotten 100x better and this film flows a lot better then AOTD. Now it still has random scenes but it flows like a \"real\" film. The sex scene is good and it made my happy but I think its not as great as everyone is saying. Overall its not a bad job all in all.\n\nAction is probably where this film kind of got me going hmmm. Now AITD and HOTD aren't good films at all but they had some decent action. BloodRayne in every aspect is Bolls best film except the action. I think the gore is good and he doesn't prolong it which is good also but nothing really excited me except for the beginning with the flashbacks. I think overall Boll went down a point in action but its classier and better fitting before.\n\nOverall this is definitely Bolls third best film(after Heart of America and Blackwoods if you ask me) but in the recent Boll era this is about .5 better then HOTD and 2 points better then AITD. I don't love/hate this film but it gave me what I wanted gore, action, and nudity and for that I am thankful\n\nOn a side note the next Boll film does look like a LOTR rip but at the same time looks actually decent and a film I would see if I didn't like bad films or films that bomb at the Box Office. A second film with all the sword fighting should be good and improve from this and it doesn't look ordinary corny like the others. I would say it got me interested but not enthused. Well next film I will be seeing is Annapolis."

I enjoy a good horror flick too but it really needs purpose and above all it should at least make sense with the movie. Good Grief! This was just plain awful. So again I ask who is to blame the film maker with no sense of direction or the gaming industry for wanting to capitalize on a game. Kristina Loken was not a very good choice for Bloodrayne and as I do like Michele Rodriguez, I don't think this was a good casting decision."

I must at least acknowledge that he made no pretense about the prospects of seeing something entertaining.\n\n\"This is going to be bad\" He told me, with a soft excitedness that actually touched me. So I went.\n\nOf the 11 people in the theater (this is on opening night), we were by far the loudest. We constantly heckled the movie, at one point the ushers told us to keep it down. We could see in their eyes that this was merely a policy-driven action, and that they truly felt sorry for us with our remaining time in hell.\n\nTo call this an actual movie is degrading to the entire genre of film and motion pictures. Although the feature is a mere 94 minutes, the movie seemed about two hours to long. My boyfriend paid $12 so we could both watch this, and he had to admit that he spent at least $20 to much on the tickets.\n\nTo comment on the weak characters and storyline would be pointless. Only see this if you want to witness something truly bad. You have been warned."

With the actors he had access to, the performances should not have been able to be bad. But there was just no life to any of it. This man needs to stop making movies.

I think they're upset that Uwe Boll keeps making god awful movies based on the ideas of video games showing he has absolutely no skill as a director. And what's worse is he keeps doing it despite the overwhelmingly negative reviews telling to please stop! Yea I'm an American and I think Hollywood movies are garbage. And Uwe Boll fits in perfectly with the all the other Hollywood garbage.\n\nUwe Boll has been so consistently bad I don't understand why he keeps making video game movies. Can't he make something original for a change? Make something that isn't video game related for awhile?\n\nGranted I have a \"If it's based on a video game it's going to be crap\" mentality but that's probably because of directors like Uwe Boll who should be playing games instead of making movies based on them."

There are several EXTREMELY poorly edited sections that leave characters in different positions, and makes the movie sound ridiculous with repeated lines. I can not remember a redeeming character, although Billy Zane's two short scenes gave me a feeling of nostalgia for \"The Phantom.\" God that guy gets great lighting.\n\nAll fights scenes involving the title character are awkward. I don't know, maybe Kristanna Loken just isn't built to be able to swing swords. They certainly looked like they were weighing her down.\n\nThere were parts of the movie where I was in a full bellied laugh, but I can't for the life of me figure out if they were meant to be funny.\n\nThis one won't be on my DVD pre-order list, and that's coming from a guy who habitually collects B movies."

WOW! my last movie really stunk, maybe I should try to do better this time and see if I can be redeemed in the face of the movie going public. A lot of movie directors have had bombs in the past and have taken #2 and have improved tremendously. Take for example Peter Jackson. His first few films like \"Meet the Feebles\" and \"Bad Taste\" are absolutely dreadfully horrid. But his recently works of \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy and \"King Kong\" are giant successes and now hes one of Hollywoods top movie directors. You would think Uwe Boll would get an idea of how bad his movies are with \"Alone in the Dark\". But he seems to be destined to be the next Ed Wood Jr. but even Ed Woods movies now have a cult following and have fallen in the \"so bad its good\" category. A category Uwe Bolls films will never fall into."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Alone in the Dark\" was a let down; I love low-budget/'bad' horror films as much as (or probably more than) most anybody and it just didn't hit the right notes. Having little hope for \"BloodRayne\" may have played to my favor, as I actually quite liked it. Oodles of blood, guts and a little slinky sex were just what I needed to enjoy this flick, and Boll delivered them in spades.\n\nGoing back to Romania of yester-year, the story tells of the origin of Rayne and the beginning of her centuries long quest to exact revenge upon her father Kagan and all his minions. It also provides a deeper look into the workings of the brimstone society (an organization that both fears and assists Rayne). For those that enjoyed the game, the story bits are actually of interest, everyone else will promptly ignore them.\n\nThe cast is a surprisingly eclectic ensemble, but a mixed bag of good and bad choices. The good players are Loken, who aside from looking the part to a 'T', down plays her performance nicely; also Madsen, who plays the grizzled mentor role well; and Kingsly, who carries an air of sadistic menace while refusing to dive into camp territory. On the opposite end are Rodriguez, horribly mis-cast and underused and Meat Loaf in a pointless and bizarre cameo.\n\nThe production side of the house did pretty much exactly what I wanted it to do. Being filmed in Romania insured little dressing had to be done to make it look like Romania (which is a gorgeous country I might add); plenty of Gothic scenery and decorations abound and the overall product quality is polished for the budget level.\n\nThe real selling point for me (and I imagine for most horror fans) is the liberal use of the red stuff. Given the violent nature of the game, I was worried that Boll might pull some punches in the gore department. That is blissfully not the case. Some much blood is spilt in regular intervals that this almost qualifies as a gore-fest and is one of the bloodiest theatrical films I've seem in quite some time. Thank the maker.\n\nSpeaking of the maker, a quick note on Uwe Boll. The much maligned director of 'House of the Dead', 'Alone in the Dark' and several up coming game adaptations has received a really unfair rap as the new Ed Wood. It seems that most people who thrash his movies are either A) bandwagon-haters (some one says it sucks and everyone falls in line) or B) award snobs (if it can't win an award, it isn't worth watching). To this I ask, what were you expecting? It's based on a game about a half-vampire tearing Nazis to shreds. It isn't supposed to win an Oscar or heighten you understanding of the world, it simply exists for you have a little fun, as do Boll's other films.\n\nSo quit the hating already.\n\n7/10"

And still i was surprised as well as disappointed.\n\nThe thing i wondered most is what kind of dirt Uwe Boll must have on actors like Ben Kingsley and Michelle Rodriguez to get them to appear in a movie like this one. Granted, they are not the biggest actors but still they have some sort of career at least. On the other hand, Michael Madsen seems to be stuck in some sort of infinite loop of crap so seeing him here is as expected. The funniest appearance is Billy Zane who seems to be unable to take this movie seriously, which is probably a healthy approach. And what about Kristanna Loken? Well it would surprise me greatly if her career in big movies would continue, she's quite an awful actress really. Unable to deliver her lines properly and lacking all kinds of subtlety.\n\nAnd the movie itself? The action scenes are mostly pathetic, dialog is uninteresting and stiff and to say the movie has serious pacing problems is an understatement. If i should try and find something positive to say then well... some of the locations are quite nice i guess? And there is some decent photography. But don't get me wrong, these points are like buying a new car and concluding that the only positive thing with it is that the steering wheel feels nice in your hands. That will hardly do you any good if the car won't even run.\n\nTo ask what could have been done better is almost futile. Both the parts and the whole are terminally flawed. I just wonder when someone will finally pull the plug on this Uwe Boll-character. Not that video games are the best basis for movies, but seriously someone else must be able to do this better."

Now i had mixed opinions about wanting to see this but they are not manifested into hatred. First of all, Rayne was hot in the video game and i bought the playboy issue just for her picture. Kristanna Loken is undeniably the worst representation of Rayne a person could have ever chosen. she looked more like Vladimir than Rayne. Secondly, No actor in this entire movie could speak a decent line, all the special effects made me feel like i was watching the 1979 version of Dracula staring Rayne instead, the dialog was rushed the entire movie and every sequences was clich\u00e9 past the point of acceptance for any movie, and Uwe Boll is probably the most God awful person alive and has created such monstrosities as House of the dead and Alone in the Dark. The whole movie is confusing, so not just by Uwe's bad direction, but also the screenplay and plot was horrible. No one should ever see this, every copy made should be burned to protect children and those who have seen it and yet alone liked it should be treated as lepers. Last of all, this movie was so bad (other than the over dramatic, forced love scene) if Kristanna went the whole movie topless, having sex with every male character including Kagan, this movie would still get a 1 out of 10.

Uwe Boll is completely talentless, a fresh community college grad could do better.\n\nThere is no way Kristanna Loken (or anyone for that matter) was trained for any good length of time for the action sequences, they all look like LARPers at a convention.\n\nThe flow of the film left it feeling disconnected, rushed, and incongruent. Scenes like the one where Rayne staggers out of her cell and mounts Sebastian, seemingly for no reason at all (and after a nightmare none-the-less) left you with your mouth open from the horror of the awful lameness and feeling insulted of your intelligence.\n\nThe gore effects made me feel like i was watching a college-made horror film as rubbery as the body parts looked and as gushing as the blood was.\n\nOh yeah the camera work/effects sucked too.\n\n...and what the crap is with the last 8min? I want my 1hr 38min back and I want it now with interest.\n\nIf you are looking for a torture film for reasons of initiation, well, you found it because this deserves a zero Thanks for a waste of my time Uwe, now stop ruining video game movies and go back to film school.

Violently. Thus, most of the \"1\" ratings are the results of rabid gamers who have a vendetta against him. This is unfortunate as it skews the results.\n\nTo me, the worst thing about this movie was Michael Madsen. He didn't seem to be acting at all, just reading words. He is followed closely by Ben Kingsley, Meatloaf and their bad hairpieces. I wish there was more of Udo Kier, I loved him as Yuri in the Command and Conquer game series.

        "review_detailed_main": "Of the four Uwe Boll films I've seen, I think that this might be the worst. It's stiff competition, for sure, but there's something extra inept, amateurish, misguided, and unappealing about BloodRayne. All of Boll's staples are here from inexplicably unnatural dialogue to incredibly dull performances to incomprehensible action scenes to flat cinematography, it's all here, but the \"story\" of BloodRayne, an attempt at epic fantasy, is so overstuffed and undercooked by design that it's kind of unbelievable.\n\nThere's so much to rag on here, but I want to focus the few precious minutes of my life I'm going to dedicate to thinking about what I hope to be the last Uwe Boll film I ever see on his complete inability to build a single character.\n\nBoll seems to believe that character traits, in his head and not actually on display in the film, are all you need. He doesn't need to show characters as brave, or strong, or loyal to someone, or villainous, or anything else. He just needs to explain it through a single line of dialogue and then the audience has all of the information they need. So, if one character calls another \"brave\", then that's all we're going to get in terms of the character's bravery. This manifests most frustratingly around the character of Katarin, played by Michelle Rodriguez. Katarin is described as loyal, but we never actually see her as so, so when she ends up betraying her friends and the protagonist, Rayne, it's not shocking. In fact, it leaves no impression whatsoever because Katarin was never a character but just a human shaped thing that spouted exposition from time to time. Her betrayal means nothing because Katarin isn't a character. She's so poorly drawn that her major act feels like nothing.\n\nThis extends to every single character in the movie. From Rayne herself, whos' described as several things but never really manifests them, to Vladimir, played by Michael Madsen (obviously drunk and uncaring), to Kagan, played by Ben Kingsley who occasionally looks like he's alive as he flatly delivers lines.\n\nMoving on a bit, the world building in this fantasy epic is laughably bad. In fact, I have no idea how this world of vampires versus the world is supposed to work. There's a vampire kingdom, and a hidden anti-vampire resistance, and nothing in between. It sounds like vampires have the upper hand, but the way Kagan's plot is described it sounds like vampires are in the shadows (metaphorically) and will use a series of talismans to bring about world domination. Very little thought seemed to be put into this.\n\nAnd another thing...any time a fantasy movie calls its magical items \"talismans\", I role my eyes. It's a weirdly tinny and awkward word. It's not that the idea of a talisman is weird (the Ring in The Lord of the Rings is technically a talisman), but the literal use of the word in dialogue. It shows me laziness.\n\nI have to touch on one more thing before I wrap up this exercise in masochism. There's a scene early when Rayne finds one of the several talismans (the eye of...someone). She arrives at a monastery, gets free reign of the place, wanders into a small hallway with a monster sleeping on a chair at the far end. Now, this hallway is lit with braziers along the columns that line the space, but they don't actually light anything. It's obvious that the whole set is lit from large electronic lights above. Instead of giving the scene a horror-like feel with bare, sourced lighting that can have the added side effect of hiding some of the dodgy makeup on the monster, everything's clear as day, undermining any source of horror-based tension.\n\nLiterally everything about this movie is laughably bad. From the lighting to the acting to the writing to the action, everything is bad. Hell, the sex scene has Rayne accidentally opening and closing a jail cell door repeatedly, and it's just left in, including the sound effects that were captured on set. It's a testament to Boll's skills as a conman that he got money for this movie at all, much less roping in someone like Ben Kingsley to play the villain. Boll is inept at every aspect of storytelling and filmmaking, and I think I'm done with him."

There's nought wrong with a bit of mindless entertainment after a hard days work.\n\nGranted Underworld, Van Helsing, Bram Stokers and the like are better than this, but it's still worth watching on DVD or TV\n\nAvoid the sequel though, that isn't very good, no Lokken either !"

The language they used was simply hilarious (I don't recall them using contractions, but if they did, it wasn't very often). Half the things that happened, like the fat vampire monk or the Rayne sex scene, made absolutely no sense.\n\nThe stunts and pretty much any choreography were absolutely terrible, so the movie fails in this way, too.\n\nBoll screwed up in many ways, but I'm sure they're all already mentioned, so I won't bother.\n\nThe acting was horrendous. Well, I've seen worse, but not by much. Kristanna Loken should not be allowed to have any parts that involve moving her face or speaking because she's not good at it. Billy Zane was pretty cool, but I don't see why his character was included at all. Michael Madsen was terrible for the part he played. Michelle Rodriguez tried to do a British accent and failed.\n\nReally, the only good thing about this movie was that there was enough action to keep me interested until they end. Only that warranted the 3/10 I gave it.\n\nI couldn't figure out what the significance of the last scenes (after the climax) was supposed to be, and I imagine there was one, but I still can't think of anything several hours later."

The sets were richly decorated and the extras added to the scenery rather than just cluttering up the vision. The story line was enjoyable and moved along at a nice pace. All of these things made it a movie I would recommend to people who enjoy this type of movie.\n\n*** Cons *** As you would expect from a Vampyre movie there was a lot of blood but I think they over did that in the combat scenes. The combat scenes were overly crowded and this made it hard to understand what was going on until the battles were resolved. Some of the dialog and character interplay was stilted and you can blame both the director and the writer for this. And the story seemed a little underdeveloped which I would hold the writer accountable for.\n\nThis is the type of movie that would be fun to see on an opening Friday night with a lot of fans so that you can watch the audience get excited as the movie unfolds. Unfortunately, my wife and I saw it on a Sunday afternoon in a mostly empty theater. But we still enjoyed it."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was seriously surprised by this film. First off, I'm a fan of the vampire genre but have generally disliked most vampire films. So I usually go to see them but am usually disappointed. Given the fact that I severely disliked House of Dead, I was really expecting a big yawnfest. Plus the trailers did nothing to help me want to see the film. If anything, the trailers are absolutely horrible. I haven't seen Alone in the Dark, and don't really plan to, but with House of Dead and the bad trailers I was really bracing for a nightmare.\n\nBut then as soon as the movie started, I was surprised. The visuals were very lush, the movie just looked very good (as opposed to that sickly green tint in the trailer). As far as the story, yeah, it's a bit convoluted, and doesn't exactly give you that sort of real pull, but Kristanna Loken really tries to push it and it's just enough that it doesn't seem so bad. It's unfortunate that the script isn't better, as Guinevere Turner is very talented, and did a great job adapting American Psycho into a screenplay.\n\nAs far as the acting, well, Billy Zane's acting wasn't so bad. He was dictating a letter, and therefore the William Shatner-ish acting made sense. Ben Kingsley had a very quiet reserve of someone in power. Michael Madsen's acting was sort of half-there, but his character was sort of half-there, he seemed like someone who didn't care to fight anymore and just kept fighting out of a sense of duty.\n\nSo yeah, nobody's going to get an Oscar out of this, but we all know that. Yeah, there's been better acting in better movies, but we all know this as well. But if you lower your expectations, drop your barrier of \"entertain me\" and just surrender to the movie, you'll find yourself sitting afterward going \"hey, that wasn't so bad. That was actually good.\" Notice, I said GOOD, not GREAT. Both me and my girlfriend give it a C+ to B- range. Is it going to be a hit with critics? No. Is it going to be a hit with Uwe Boll haters? No. But is it better than Dracula 2000, Dracula 3000, and Queen of the Damned? Yes. Is Uwe Boll getting better since House of Dead? Yes, very much so."

In the end, a pretty bad movie. At least with this one I could laugh at some of the stupid lines and fight scenes, unlike House of the Dead which is just plain painful.

        "review_detailed_main": "Blunt and forthright though the direction was, I found no fault with the first 7.5 minutes. Then 'BloodRayne' leapt to a scene two story beats ahead, flashing back to that which preceded it sequentially. Stir in significant overacting from star Kristanna Loken, and the stage is set for one big mess.\n\nI knew what I was getting into. The film is infamous, and I'd previously seen a few of Uwe Boll's other films. And still I watched. Ultimately, much to my surprise, I don't think it's entirely as bad as what its reputation portends - but that's obviously not saying much.\n\nMany noteworthy names appear in the cast, and they've all proven themselves elsewhere again and again. But Boll's vision forces them into such ham-fisted, cockamamie performances that if one knew nothing else of Loken, Madsen, Kingsley, Rodriguez, or the rest, one would be forgiven for thinking their craft exactly equivalent to Boll's. It's like their paycheck for 'BloodRayne' was conditional on either the most perfunctory of speech and physical movement, or the most exaggerated - with no allowance for a middle ground.\n\nScenes of action and bloodshed hold promise, but from the earliest moments are shot in a jarringly haphazard manner. I'm guessing Boll considered his style here to be novel in a way that would fuel excitement, but instead the frenzied camerawork feels amazingly amateurish, constantly threatening our engagement. Special effects employed during these action scenes, and especially in the most bloody and gory instances, feel less believable than in any other picture that immediately comes to mind. It's one matter to be pointedly over the top, above all if such is the tone of the film generally; consider John Carpenter's brilliant, deadpan 'Ghosts of Mars.' It's another matter entirely to execute visuals with such little care for how they blend into a \"serious\" horror action-thriller that they're readily recognizable as CGI. And that's largely just how they're presented in 'BloodRayne.'\n\nI'm given to understand that Boll substantially rewrote what established screenwriter Guinevere Turner provided. This seems plainly truthful - for, astoundingly, there's a solid foundation to the screenplay. I think there are many genuinely great ideas throughout the feature, which together form the underpinnings of what could have been a decisively honored classic. If Turner's draft still existed somewhere in the world, I would quite like to see it realized as a feature.\n\nBut then the work of Boll's heavy-handed directness bursts through the pages, saturating the picture with schlock. Dialogue is often hackneyed, always feeling rushed and heedlessly straightforward so as to advance the plot as fast as possible. So it is too with characterizations, and most story beats generally. Consider a very early exchange between Rayne and a seer, pushing our heroine forward: Rayne, given information, asks \"Why do you tell me this?\" - and the throwaway supporting character states outright, \"Because it's my purpose!\"\n\nSo it is with 'BloodRayne' as a whole. I honestly like the set design and decoration, makeup, costume design and wardrobe, and the props on hand. Yet into these are inserted such bluster, bombast, and balderdash that they're subsumed by the low quality of the most actively off-putting aspects. Maybe it's unfair, but I'm inclined to believe that those scenes that are most well-done overall are the remnant's of Turner's screenplay, while the most tawdry moments represent Boll's handiwork. Composer Henning Lohner's music likewise alternates between \"suitable\" and \"laughable.\"\n\nI think 'BloodRayne' also deserves special mention for what is possibly the least sexy or exciting sex scene ever committed to film. And it's just as notable that upon the conclusion of the climactic fight, we're given a perfect shot to end on that I again assume was penned by Turner. That would-be achievement is then cast aside for a needless, pointless, excessive montage revisiting previous story beats and bloodbaths before the credits roll. Boll's idea, no doubt.\n\nI admit I'm a little torn. There are parts of this movie I actually like, far exceeding my expectations and suggesting underappreciated value. On the other hand, within and around what I judge to be a strong framework is clustered entirely too much subpar, over the top, ill-considered, poorly realized content that all too easily balances the scales. Watching is a constant oscillation between \"This has no business being this good\" and \"This is exactly what I was told to anticipate.\"\n\nTo be fair, it's also possible that I've soaked in too many substandard flicks of late, such that this one just seems like gold by comparison.\n\nIs 'BloodRayne' exactly as bad as everyone says it is? Yes and no; it has, startlingly, some redeeming qualities. Is 'BloodRayne' worth going out of your way to find? No, absolutely not - not for general audiences, certainly, and probably not even for B-movie buffs. Is it possible to enjoy 'BloodRayne' anyway? Yes, I really do think so - so long as you're fully aware of what you're getting into.\n\nNot a particularly good movie - yet, shockingly, not Uwe Boll's worst."

An achievement that would send any new filmmaker pack his bags and head back to his hometown. However, it seems Dr. Boll is unaffected by this lack of success and viewer's distaste for his films.

        "review_detailed_main": "I never expected anything great or smart or even coherent out of this. I went into it totally blind, wanting nothing more than a cheap and cheesy B-movie with lots of sex appeal and lots of blood and gore. And you know what? The film delivered! There are really only a couple of reasons to watch this film: for the incredible blood and gore effects (which are fantastic in the unrated cut, but incredibly subdued in the original theatrical version) and for Kristanna Lokken's performance, of which I am particularly fond of.\n\nThis film has earned its name as one of the all-time worst films ever made for a few good reasons though. First and foremost, it has absolutely nothing to do with the original video game. The game pitted the titular dhampir against Nazis during WWII, to find some Atlantean artifact and fight monsters and vampires...this movie throws it all out the window and just has Rayne in the Dark Ages embarking in a simple revenge story. It does little-to-no justice to its source material. Even on its own merits, the film is hobbled together with seemingly-random scenes, some of which could have been cut entirely. The best that can be said is that the story is serviceable; it's coherent enough to follow the characters and the action, but it is riddled with plot holes, inconsistencies, and frivolous scenes.\n\nAs far as the film itself goes, the single most redeeming value will be its photography; despite a few shaky-cam scenes, the camera work is pretty solid at times. Acting is atrocious; I read that Michael Madsen was drunk when they filmed this, and it shows. Michelle Rodriguez puts on her standard tough-girl act, Matthew Davis offers some horrid line delivery, Meat Loaf offers a strange and frivolous cameo, it's hard to take Billy Zane seriously in anything he does, and even Ben Kingsley shows weakness as a flat and emotionally-void villain. The only bright spots here will be Michael Pare and Kristanna Lokken, who still contributes to the pool of bad acting with some bad dialogue and some incredibly weak-looking fight choreography. I only give her a pass, partly because she offers some decent sex appeal here, but mostly because I like the expressions and her mannerisms as Rayne (much unlike Natassia Malthe, who does manage to be more physically appealing, but plays it so tough that she becomes unlikable). Writing is terrible across the board; lines are simple and stupid, and their deliveries are often weak. This production does have some really wicked blood and gore effects. Sets, props, and costumes generally get the job done, but aren't terribly great either. Special effects are pretty bad. Music is alright.\n\nAs Uwe Boll's third video-game adaptation, he pretty much strikes out (and strangely, never does give up the game). Chances are that you may watch all his movies and find them \"so bad they're good,\" but most will just dismiss them as \"so bad they're bad.\" In the case of BloodRayne, it is indeed a bad film and a missed opportunity for making a quality game adaptation (somewhat redeemed with BloodRayne: The Third Reich, but even that's pretty trashy). As it is, BloodRayne comes down as one of my ultimate choices for a guilty pleasure, since it is rather entertaining with its frivolous sex and violence, but most other viewers will not be so easily appeased.\n\n2.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Poor | Film: Very Poor)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Director Uwe Boll happily churns out another piece of Hollywood trash in BLOODRAYNE, a video game adaptation set in a medieval world where a half-human vampire escapes from a carnival in Romania and goes after her father, an evil vampire overlord. Along the way she joins up with a team of ruthless vampire hunters, where the stage is set for a final showdown...\n\nOkay, where do we begin? This is a trashy B-movie, yes, but it's no different to a dozen or so others I could mention. B-movie lovers might actually enjoy it, given that it's relatively action-packed and fills the relevant quotients of gore (CGI augmented for the most part, unfortunately) and nudity (brief). The main problem BLOODRAYNE has lies in Boll himself, who shoots the various fight scenes very poorly and who has trouble getting authentic performances out of his cast members.\n\nKristanna Loken (TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES) is the titular character and to say her performance is wooden would be an understatement. She's absolutely terrible; rarely do we see such bad acting from leading actors, but this badness is the stuff of legend. Boll knows this, so he rounds out his cast with a ton of familiar faces. We get Ben Kingsley as the hammy villain, cameos from Michael Pare and Geraldine Chaplin, Meat Loaf chewing the scenery with relish, and even a bewigged Billy Zane, playing it tongue-in-cheek. The main actors are a slumming-it Michael Madsen and an out-of-place Michelle Rodriguez. A weird bald guy, Will Sanderson, seems to be in competition with Loken as to who can give the worst performance. I'm going with Loken."

        "review_detailed_main": "Deep in the heart of Romania, vampire slayers hear a story about a woman believed to be a monster in a low-rent carnival nearby, and once she escapes she learns of her fate to acquire a special amulet to battle a vampire master and agrees to help them overcome the army of vampires.\n\nThere's actually a lot more than what would seem to indicate. Among its best features is the old-time setting as it's such a welcome change from what is normally given to us about vampires. It also plays a part of it being a nice sweeping epic-look to it with the sweeping vistas and swelling orchestral scores and is a really pleasant change to see a film go for a feel like that with a very epic feeling present throughout here. In addition, the inclusion of her vampire tendencies in that type of storyline allows for some enjoyable action present here, starting with the beginning where a carnival man drags her out and spills water on her arm, resulting in severe burns before the blood of a farm animal causes her wounds to instantly heal back to normal, the carnival massacre is a nice set-piece that enables her escape into the world as well as the manipulation of several traps held in the church for their protection. It's best sequence is where one character is trapped inside a quickly flooding cavern which is nicely suspenseful, as is a daytime raid on a brothel to rescue a kidnapped ally. There are also several well-choreographed extended battles here that wouldn't seem out of place in a medieval movie to provide lots of action, from the assault on the monastery to capture her to the various battles that take place inside the temple at the end which manages to contain plenty of action, confrontations and graphic bloodshed which is really nice and bloody. This is far better than what is said about it as there is very little in here that didn't work. The main thing that hurts this is the side-plots that are thrown in every now and then to try to add more to the story but actually take away from it. The main gist here is good enough and serves the film well since there's only a single thread that covers the action. When a new idea is brought up, such as the inclusion of the need for the various amulets to be obtained before anything can transpire or the vampire rituals that are needed to be performed before they can continue their plans, it only confuses rather than explain due to the excessive elements brought in that don't add much. As well, the change in nature from the video-game to the movie is a little different which might be a problem for some to get over. These here are what manage to hold this one down.\n\nRated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Language, Nudity and a mild sex scene."

        "review_title": "Very Bloody Indeed!",
        "review_detailed_main": "Another vampire movie has just come out. \"Bloodrayne\" is as bloody as its namesake. Here you have a woman named Rayne(Kristanna Loken) as a sultry but lethal dhampir who kills anyone who crosses her. Even a vampire is the victim of her wrath. She is trusting among some people, but many dread the undead. Don't we all? Unless they fight back, the humans have Rayne on her side. Vladamir(Michael Madsen,\"Species1&2\"), Sebastian(Matt Davis), and Katarin(Michelle Rodriguez) lead the way to find Kagan(Ben Kingsley). To me part of this game based movie is quite similar to \"Castlevania\", however, Dracula is never mention, so that's good. It's amazing that Rayne was sympathetic to the sister whose brother was slain by the vampires. And I liked the part where Rayne seduced the woman vampire and killed her afterward, and the thieves rob her later. Just like the game, Rayne has a hot body, and Sebastian took advantage of \"being inside her\". Reminds me of \"Innocent Blood\". It's a shame that Katarin turned out to be a turncoat, and everything is way out of whack. How would the fighters know? The effects and the fight scenes were indeed awesome, and the blood was just too much. It's great that Loken got to do more and show very much in this movie. I know Rayne was heartbroken when Sebastian decided to die than to live forever, for him why live when your family is avenged. It's a pity that he would be dead than live with the soul mate who is indeed \"shared her heart\". I'd been a fool to sacrifice when there's more terror out there. A very interesting movie, lots of action, lots of fun, and it's great for all the fans of the game. I enjoyed it a lot! It was interesting and intriguing. Rating 2.5 out of 5 stars."

If you're not expecting A films, Bloodrayne will provide you with enough action, some lovable corny dialog and acting, the gore you wanted and nothing more/less.\n\nSome will dislike it for this reason, but I liked it as it was. And what was it? A action/horror/vampire-film. My only problem with this flick was the casting. Michael Madsen and Ben Kingsley should not be in this film. Kristanna Loken, Matt Davis, Will Sanderson and of course Billy Zane were cool!\n\nSo here's my advice. Don't hate this film in advance. Grab a beer and some chips. Set your mood to mindless fun and you'll have a great evening."

Somehow he continually conjures money in extreme sums to make some of the worst movies the world has ever seen, and when he's finished, there's always somebody else waiting to give him more for his next project. Bloodrayne cost $25 mill. His next, Dungeon Siege, cost $60 mill. Who keeps giving this guy cash? Bloodrayne stars one hit wonder, Kristanna Loken (of T3 fame) as, well, Bloodrayne, a half vampire, half human hot-chick floating about a (presumably, although I don't know for sure) fantasy land. She has to save the world from eternal damnation by...doing something. To be honest, the plot is so ill-conceived that I lost interest and only kept watching to see how bad it actually got. Michael Madsen forgets all the good work he done on Kill Bill Vol. 2 and reverts back to acting so wooden it makes Chuck Norris look like an Oscar candidate. Michelle Rodriguez ponce's around delivering her lines with the same conviction as an after dinner mind would. Ben Kingsley. Wow. How the mighty fall from grace. From Oscar gold in Ghandi to looking like and old man dressing in his grandmothers wig and clothes, his role is reduced to an embarrassing cameo. All in all, Bloodrayne doesn't really have that much going for it. Not even the bloody (and I mean bloody) battle scenes could hold my interest. That said, though, I know there will be a few of you out there, like myself, who will put themselves through torture just to say you survived another Dr Boll film. Now, if only they'd sell T-Shirts that said that..."

Michael Madsen acts like he just stopped by to pick up his check and discovered that they wanted him to recite some lines. Ben Kingsley - what can I say. I know he got an Oscar for Ghandi but ever since he's been trying very hard to make us think that was a mistake. Michelle Rodriguez - well she does tough-chick-with-an-attitude-trying-to-be-hot pretty well (it got her through \"Lost\") - I wonder if she can do anything else?? The plot is reasonable and flows pretty well and the photography is good (although we do seem to have an excess of mountain range scenery). The gore? Well, it's actually pretty funny. It's so over the top that it reminds me of Monty Python and the Holy Grail.\n\nNormally a film like this would prompt me to say \"There's an hour and a half I'll never see again!\" and give it one star while wishing I could give it zero. But, as I said - it has Kristanna Loken.\n\nJust as an aside - Uwe Boll actually did a movie that I think is pretty good - \"The Final Storm\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "I didn't go into BloodRayne expecting much beyond a mediocre action movie. Movies based on games are seldom that good, but this one actually had some relatively big name actors, and a plot that wasn't entirely contrived.\n\nHowever the acting was incredibly flat, and the dialog has that awkward feel that many \"period\" dramas have which is caused by the failure to use a contraction. Of course, even without that the lines feel like they were read off of cue cards. In fact the best acting performance of the bunch was delivered by Will Sanderson, a relative unknown (actually he gives a good performance). The second best performance is by Billy Zane who has a small role. Actually, the second best performance is given by the prostitutes surrounding Meat Loaf. They really do act like prostitutes.\n\nI point out the prostitutes because there is gratuitous nudity in this movie (which I find sadly lacking in many of the schlocky movies that have come out recently). There is even a gratuitous sex scene between Kristanna Loken and Matt Davis. It isn't just gratuitous, it has the feel of a scene that was shot for addition to the deleted scenes section of a DVD. The director will cleverly say the scene was cut because of \"pacing\". Or in this case because they couldn't figure out a way to segue into a sex scene. So instead she basically gets up in the middle of the night, strolls out of her jail cell and jumps his bones.\n\nThere are numerous others parts of the movie where I was just scratching my head trying to figure out why the characters were doing what they were doing. It is one thing for the heroes to end up being saved by deux ex machina, but it is another thing entirely for the heroes to rely on it.\n\nOn a final note, why make Michelle Rodriquez wear blue contacts? It doesn't improve her acting and only makes her look more out of place in the movie. All she does in this movie is skulk around and scowl. However, at least part of that is the fault of the script."

I thought the actress who played Bloodrayne was pretty good and very pretty. She made the movie worth the eight bucks I spent.\n\nThe action scenes pretty much ruined the movie. They were not very well filmed and a bit hard to follow. People who like blood and gore will like the effects though.\n\nThe obviously aluminum swords the actors were using had visibly blunt edges that really looked cheesy. Monty Python had better looking weapons. You could actually watch them get dinged up during the duels, and during the close ups you could see the gouges in the metal. Guess they could not afford nicer swords for the close up shots. Perhaps this was petty of me to complain about, but it was very obviously cheesy, particularly with Michael Madsen not even bothering to have a sheath for his sword.\n\nI don't regret going to see it, it was better than cabin fever, but it was not very good."

The worst part is, it had the money and the potential to be something great. The costumes were great and it was filmed in Romania, so the sets were great. The special effects were even impressive. If they had hired a better writer and cinematographer it could have been a block buster. Anyway, if it comes out on television and you want a good laugh (the whole 6 of us in the theater laughed a good bit) then you should watch it, otherwise, see something other then this movie."

I had hoped it would be okay before I began watching the movie, but within the first ten minutes, I was thinking to myself \"Why on earth did they cast such an awful actress in this emotional part?\" Her tearful cries are far from heartbreaking--in fact, I'd say they're more eardrum-breaking if you get what I'm saying. She sounds like a cat doing an impression of a dog drowning in chocolate sauce. A really bad impression.\n\nAfter she's done screaming and writhing in obviously-fake emotional pain, the movie gets slightly better. The rest of the acting (with the exception of Michelle Rodriguez, who has only ever played one good role, Rain in \"Resident Evil\") is pretty good, but obviously low-budget and not top-notch. The acting is really my main concern.\n\nVisually, this movie is reasonably gorgeous. The cinematography isn't very impressive, but it's better then some I've seen, and the camera quality is superb on my 38in TV. The graphics look good, and the stunts are well done, but the blood looks really fake and ruined the moment a few times. The story is fairly true to the video games, but isn't nearly as satisfying. Rayne kicks a lot less ass in this film then she does in the games. A lot. I blame that on Kristianna. Moving on... The set design is quite satisfying, and the costumes are acceptable if not good.\n\nThis movie is FAR BETTER then the last movie I watched, which was \"The Wickerman\" starring Nicolas Cage. Sad, isn't it? Someone should redo this film with a better cast and a bigger budget, and then maybe it'd be okay. For now, though, I'm saying stay away unless you love BloodRayne or not-that-great, B-grade movies. If you just like vampires, not b-grade movies or video games, don't bother."

A half human and half vampire, Rayne, hunts vampires and wants revenge on the vampire that raped and killed her mother. She joins forces with vampire hunters. That's about it.\n\nMichelle Rodriguez was terrible. She had this British accent and was just silly with that permanent scowl she seems to have. And I guess Ben Kingsly took this part for the pay check. And why can't Michael Madson find better roles than this. And Loken has her obligatory porn moment.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: Script just doesn't cut it. Watch it if you want to see a lot of fake blood flowing everywhere."

If Mr Boll was in a normal job he would be fired ! All I can say is the next studio that puts Mr Boll in to direct should think again ! I think they might as well employ me to do the job ! I gave it 3 cause I felt sorry for him as I gave alone in the dark 1 . IMDb has asked me to write a further two lines cause it has a minimum of 10 lines ?

Be warned then that I would have been egregiously wrong. It's so uninteresting I couldn't bear to watch more than half of it. The cast, while potentially one of the greatest ever, delivers a lackluster performance. The story could have been epic, but is instead more like reading the highlighted sections in a used college textbook. I've not played the video game, but I'd wager that this movie totally fails to capture even a whiff of its spirit. Indeed, this movie is without a spirit. It's a zombie. It's a film school freshman's first class project. As the summary says, it really is THAT bad."

No, we don't know how he convinces people to give him money. No, he's not the new Ed Wood because Ed Wood loved film and loved film-goers.\n\nWhich brings me to my point. I think I have decided why Uwe Boll is hated by the entire film community: He hates us. It's pretty clear that he hates film-goers by the way it shows on camera. He makes you pay your hard earned money to see over the top violence, confusing plot lines, and terrible miscasted acting. To make a movie this insufferable is like slapping everyone that sees it in the face.\n\nUnfortunately, Uwe Boll is untouchable. He won't actually come out and say that he hates everyone. Instead he plays it off as the victim. Until we can trap him into saying such, we can just boycott his terrible movies and question how he still has funds to make the huge flops that he self produces. Maybe one day the German government will do an audit on Uwe Boll and find some interesting things, because you can only make so many flops before you go completely bankrupt."

I enjoyed Billy Zane's silly performance and above that, Michael Madsen looked like he was going to roll his eyes after every line. Ben Kingsley is still a fine actor, even after being in this movie. Michelle Rodriguez looks delicious as always. I enjoyed seeing her in this. I enjoyed the bloody fight scenes and the vampiric sets. It was a fairly good-humored movie. I can 100% assure you that this isn't one of the 100 worst movies of all time. I can understand that people hate Uwe Boll and deservedly so but this is pretty typical b-movie swashbuckling fare. Nothing really great here but nothing really terrible either. I mean we're not talking about Gone With the Wind here or American Beauty. This is a video game movie and I liked it better than either of the Mortal Kombat movies, which should have been bloodier like this. Well, I hate to find myself defending this movie but it's more fun than most of the reviewers are saying."

The cover looked really nice, the trailer was cool, and the storyline itself had the potential to be very engaging. Who doesn't like the idea of a half-vampire kicking a bunch of vampire butt? Blade anyone? What I got was a dismal piece of crap. The acting was poor, the special effects were cheesy, and the storyline was horribly mutilated. In addition, the production quality was made for TV grade. Why in the world did anyone even think this stood a chance in theaters? The only thing saving this movie is the protagonist, played by Kristanna Loken. She pulls off an attractive, deadly but lost Rayne. At best, you can take all the shots with her in it and make a nice YouTube collage. At least people would watch that in its entirety.\n\nI wish this had been released as a made for TV movie for the Sci-fi channel. I would have considered this a moderate quality movie for that venue, and may have actually enjoyed it in that case because it would have matched my expectations. Instead, I get the cheesiest storyline and gore seen in the box office since the 80's. Two out of 5 stars only because Loken pulls off a decent performance."

Nope, you can't cover all this up with gruesome (if not a little repetitive and almost comical at times, bloody killings! At this point, as he keeps getting directorial jobs given to him, I believe Bolle is purposely making a mockery of film with this and is other \"efforts\" - knowing it is tolerated!...and Bloodrayne 2 has been green lighted!!

It's less easy to revel in the film that is mediocre than the film that is truly bad.

And let me tell you this, he needs to stick to his singing! My only complaint, other than the horrible script and acting, was the ending, which obviously set up for a sequel.

The film's plot doesn't matter, it didn't seem to matter to the director who shot this with all the zest and skill of a drunken campfire tale, and it didn't seem matter to the actors who all seem to be acting without knowing what order the scenes will be shown. In the end it didn't matter to me either. This movie is entirely forgettable and will probably be considered a stain on the resumes of all parties involved, and the worst part is that the director seems baffled that so many people think that it is a terrible film.

Not because it was good, but because it featured everything I'd missed from 80's B-movie fantasy; lots of swordplay with brazen gore and bloodshed, T&A, and a requisite bondage scene. So the lighting and effects were low-budget, the fantasy period trappings plastic, story implausible, drama ineffectual and dialog, if not poor enough on its own, delivered even worse. So what if an all-star cast of excellent veteran actors put on the most flaccid performances of their lives -- with the notable exception of Billy Zane, who appeared to really get into the fantasy spirit of it, and enjoyed playing his character.\n\nI imagined it would encourage more (and hopefully more talented) directors to reconstruct the fantasy genre and bring it out of the Disney ghetto, even if they have to steer it into another ghetto -- it's certainly no more gratuitously sexual and violent than contemporary set films by directors who deserve more respect than to be mentioned in this review.\n\nIf it weren't for this movie, I probably wouldn't have played the games and discovered how inadequate the film was. So Rayne was visually reproduced in live-action, with an amateur cosplay outfit that we can all recognize, but not much else about the character survived the adaptation. Boll decided to trade in Rayne's stabbing wit and black humor for outraged glares and berserk tantrums, leaving a character that lives up to Rayne about as much as Uma Thurman lives up to Emma Peel -- basically a bimbo posturing unconvincingly.\n\nBoll also took great liberties with continuity to history and character, which would've been a fair trade for good story, if that's what he delivered. Instead it showed how little respect he had for the original text he was 'adapting', and the result in comparison shows how little qualified Boll is to produce for video game, since he can't even entertain a captive audience before a passive medium."

However, the special effects are close to what you see in ambitious home videos, not a single blood spray looks close to convincing. What's more, the choreography is at a level one would expect from a movie in the 1960ies, not in the 21st century.\n\nI suspect the budget was rather low, which would also explain why a cast full of great names from Michael Madsen and Michelle Rodriguez over Billy Zane to none less than Ben Kingsley(!) performs like a bunch of bloody beginners. (Although why they signed up for this project remains a mystery.) The first shock comes when Rodriguez stabs a woman in the belly with a gesture of absolute indifference and zero force behind it, while the others stand by with an expression along the lines of \"I'm hungry.

One it could have disproved a certain British critic's law of 'all movies based on video games are trash', two it actually had some fairly talented cast members (say what you will of Meatloaf, I'll probably agree), and finally, Guinevere Turner is a very fine screenwriter.\n\nSo I'm not certain what went wrong here... The cinematography is pretty nice, as is the set design in a very kind of upscale 'Hammer Studios' sort of way, the costumes are gorgeous (and I'll admit that Ms. L\u00f8ken's figure doesn't hurt that opinion, (average indeed... some people clearly haven't a realistic view) which is ONLY my opinion). The score is good; by a well-respected composer... the only answer I can come up with is Mr. Boll.\n\nHere we have an obvious effort by Turner to turn the story (Which is sort of very loose prequel to the arc of the game) into the classic horror trope of a rape/vengeance film, along side the potential to deal with all the deep seeded psychological issues of being a vampire, ESPECIALLY a half vampire, that even the said Hammer films deal with...and there are some hints of Turner's usual tropes dealing with gender and sexuality that are made rather brief and tawdry; surely it wasn't her fault very little of that made it on screen, and what did end up there, is largely Uwe's clumsily choreographed and shot fight-scenes with large amounts of suspiciously water fake blood. What was kept is there because it's 'hot', or gory. And we see far to little of Kingsly, and the other talent, even Rodriguez (who tends to be type-cast) is a far better actress than she appears to be here.\n\nSo in the end it is mildly entertaining fluff, that feels very 'half-done', though markedly better than Mr. Boll's previous efforts."

        "review_detailed_main": "Things I did while watching this movie: I examined my toenails for any irregularities, I drank four beers (not quite enough), I called my mum and urged her to stay on the phone for like forty minutes, I went to the toilet for at least three times, partly because of the beer, partly because I wanted to check with the mirror if I already changed into some sort of drug-crazy masochist (surprisingly I did) and finally, I opened my windows, screaming out to the world, screeching into the night: \"NO! IT CAN'T BE TRUE!!! GOD HAVE MERCY ON MY SOUL AND KILL ME!!\" This is what I seem to get for staying home. I stay home for like two days on a weekend per year. One of these days is Christmas. Fatal mistake. The next fatal mistake was to assume that Uwe Boll movies would supply some sort of sick entertainment. I mean, I am proud owner of a Plan 9 DVD copy and it is my precious, yes young hobbitses. That is one bad film, but it is entertaining. You laugh, you watch it with your friends, you watch it with some other friends, you watch it with your girlfriend and you don't care because she is busy doing nice stuff to you. But with BloodRayne, I do not know.\n\nI would never ever put anyone through what I had to go through. I never experienced such stupid dialog, dumb delivery. There is no acting in this movie, there is just people who co-incidentally spoke some text while the camera was running. There is no direction whatsoever. There are shots of horses' asses talking to each other (time and again in the voice of Michael Madsen). And it looks so bad. And it hurts the eye. The music is like on a loop and never matches the action. The editing is awful and pointless (what's with the ending anyway??). The CGI was done on a C64. And it looks OH SO BAD!! I have never ever never ever seen a film that looked so unpleasant to the eye and I am an 80s film freak, when films looked oh so bad. It is unbearable! There was some suspense in it. I wondered if Ben Kingsley would ever move (or blink his eyes for that matter), that kept me awake for most of the movie. There was some gore in it, thanks to Mr Ittenbach. But he should have directed it too, because his earliest amateur movies are better than this crap. I urge you all: before you see a film you don't explicitly like and prepare yourselves bashing the poor director writer actor whatever - take a look at this and writhe in pain.\n\nBy the way: I spent a week of watching three video game-to-movie, urm, movies. Silent Hill was anything but perfect, but stylish and okay. Doom was anything but okay, but had a great FPS sequence and solid action to pull you through. But BloodRayne? It is not even a movie by today's standards. I read that Boll is just pulling off a giant tax scam (my money by the way, since I am German). Now, there is a gazillion ways of evading taxes, why, oh merciful lord in heaven, does it have to be us, the movie goers, to bear the consequences? I cannot say anything more. My thoughts are out of order. This cannot be true. There must be ---- REVENGE!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Wait... This... Isn't... a comedy? Oh... my God. I just sat through 99 minutes of the unrated directors cut laughing my ass off when... It wasn't a comedy? Wow. What a surprise.\n\nNo joke - This movie is hilarious. Watching the horribly directed and choreographed actors stumble around the sets belting out their lines like a bunch of sick cattle, listening to the oh-so-embarrassing and clich\u00e9 dialogue (example: \"If it's a war they want then a war they shall get\"), watching the terrible and annoying camera work jerk around and try to cover up the lack of choreography, pointless and excessive blood spraying out of random characters sitting back, probably thinking \"Oh, jeeze, what does a guy do when they get stabbed? Oh well, the blood will cover it up...\" and acting like \"Oh, jeeze, I've been stabbed. Well, damn it...\", Michael Madsen playing the seemingly pointless role of a guy wearing a mullet that really doesn't need to be in the movie other than to pound information into your head and offer second and third explanations about what we already know is happening (and have one of the worst performances, besides Meat Loaf), and having the main character enter a dungeon to find a random old fat guy sitting in a chair that she needs to fight and kill to get the trinket to advance to the next level had me rolling on the floor helplessly gasping for air. Yes, there actually are many parts that are extremely boring, but it's worth it to sit through that half hour of the movie to watch the other parts that are so gut-bustingly hilarious.\n\nOne of the many problems in \"Bloodrayne\" is that it feels like a video game. Seriously, she has to collect three trinkets to advance through the \"game\", all the while fighting bosses and riding horses from level to level... It gets so bland and stupid feeling that the movie begins not to feel like a movie but more like a video game that you plop in - only to find out that you take no part in the actual game. It's ridiculous.\n\nAs I briefly mentioned earlier, this movie is FILLED with clich\u00e9s. Seriously, you will sit there and have to listen to such lines as \"Keep your friends close, your enemies even closer\" while later in the movie suddenly a character that we've known all along as a good guy turns out to be a bad guy for no apparent reason other than the idiot director Uwe Boll thought it would add a surprise element to the plot. Oh, yeah, and while all these clich\u00e9s are being played out there's a bunch of gratuitous and out-of-place gore scenes everywhere that really come off as more annoying than powerful. But, I mean, it's still all really funny.\n\nAnd I will point out the fact of how horribly laid out \"Bloodrayne\" is. Basically, you start with a bunch of flashbacks (or maybe not flashbacks? I don't know...) and then our main character, Rayne, played by an actress who now probably has a dead career outside of Uwe Boll films from now on, Kristanna Loken, goes crazy and kills a bunch of people. Then the rest of the film is laid out basically level by level with a boss at the end of each one. Something happens, then a bunch of random shots of people riding horses, then something happens, then a bunch of random shots of people riding horses, then something happens... It is all laid out like this. The entire movie.\n\nThis movie was obviously made without any effort. Serously, I won't give it away, but if you decide to watch this movie for a good laugh (the ONLY thing you will get out of it) then take notice to how hilarious, stupid, and thoughtless the part where Vladimir and Sebastian decide to escape. There is another part that is as stupid and thoughtless as that part, but I'm leaving you to find it. Hint: It has to do with a small box and a heart...\n\nReally, my main question is why this was released in theaters at all? It honestly feels like sub-B material with sub-B acting with a sub-B plot with a sub-B director, Uwe Boll. Which brings about another question: Why is this idiot still making movies? Honestly, there has to be some point where he'll just stop and realize that he can't blame his actors or scriptwriters anymore, that he can't say that fans can't be satisfied or that people are just picking on him because he's the German guy. He has to, unless he is a complete and utter idiot. The final question: why two stars instead of the one it deserves? Well, because the movie was damn funny."

The negative reviews going around are based on two things - biased \"reviews\" from people who haven't even seen the movie, and reviews from biased people who have some kind of grudge with the director. (Who IMO, does a good job of bringing video games to the big screen.)\n\nThe story is here, the action is here, and the sex appeal is definitely here. You have to see the cat fight between Rayne and Katarin (Michelle Rodriguez) to believe it. Sexy and looks good! That fight scene will be stuck in my head for a long time.\n\nReally to be fair about things, if you're even slightly interested in Bloodrayne and curious about it, do yourself a favor and go see it. The only real way to know if you like a movie or not is to see it yourself, not listen to biased reviews from people who simply have their own personal opinion on things. We've all got different opinions so some may like it some may not. But to say there's no story would be incredibly unfair. It's there. The acting is there. The visuals and sexiness are definitely there (they compliment any vampire movie very well) and my god, again, that cat fight between Rayne and Michelle Rodriguez.. Believe me, while I woudn't claim this to be a \"perfect\" movie, it's definitely far from a bad one. Just as I was there opening day of the release, I'll be getting the DVD the first day it comes out.\n\nNow here's to hoping there will be a sequel!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Bloodrayne, spun-off the popular video game, is one of those movies that you think will suck. Well, lo and behold, its doesn't. Thats due to Uwe Boll's hyper-kinetic direction and Kristanna Loken's full on performance. They drive the story at such Pace that you barely have time to sit back and say, \"Gee, that was silly\"\n\nThere is some silliness here. Rayne, the off-spring of a very malignant vampire lord played by, of all people, Ben Kingsley, and a human mother, is reduced to an abused carnival freak. She breaks free, slaughtering people left and right, only to hook up with the Brimstone three, warriors who battle the undead. She learns her father, Kagan, is trying to find three talismans to unlock secrets that will enable vampires free reign and thus take over the earth. Since he raped and killed her mother, Rayne is happy to saddle up for revenge.\n\nDid I mention the action? Terrific battle scenes and more exotic weaponry that you could shake your scimitar at. Loken's acting may not match her physical abilities, but who cares? She's smoking hot here. Michael Madsen, slumming again, is the be-wigged anti-hero Vladimir and he actually does more than the occasional growl. Matt DAvis is the requisite young hunk. He's dull but his scenes with Loken are passionate. Michelle Rodriguez is along as the hard to figure KAtarin, she's very good here, all accent and sullen looks and sex appeal. Rodriguez was one of the best things about the original \"Resident Evil\" and she proves again that she's a talented actress. Billy Zane plays her father, and please more of this terrific actor! He steals both his scenes so easily its like he's in a better movie.\n\nThats not to denigrate Bloodrayne, with is quick, exciting and very bloody, seriously, were talking Bram Stoker here. Rayne ends up absorbing the talismans that Kagan wants, thats weird and never explained very well. How does she do this? Why? The climax of the picture in Kagan's predictably dark castle, is a bit arch and the last shot of Rayne taking her Father's throne is way too enigmatic for me. What does this mean? Is she OK? Or will she be like him? Odd ending. Still I really enjoyed this flick. If your'e not too demanding and enjoy medieval romps with lots of sex and violence, this is a good crowd pleaser. Oh, yes that is Meat Loaf!!!"

Micheal Madsen seems to have lost his ability to act. He sounds like he's reading his lines off a chalkboard, or intentionally trying to make people laugh. Ben Kingsley seemed like he realized what a mistake he'd made by signing on and didn't even attempt, because he knew it was hopeless. The editing is brutal, the dialogue is juvenile and foreign at best, the fight choreography is on par with fifth grade wrestling matches, the effects at times were half decent and at others laugh out loud bad. Christina Loken's breasts were amazing. That being said, Go find any copy of this movie and burn it before you waste anytime watching it."

If you look at the video game the swords she has don't have metal at the back end they are strapped to her arm and in the movie they are bladed on the back. Rayne is also portrayed as an ass-kicking half breed and in the movie she is a timid bad fighter that needs to be taught. Also didn't like how they were basically set in two different time periods.

All the cast act terribly and make bad attempts at changing their accents, the fight choreography is done badly and looks crap, when doing action scenes you should make the fights unorthodox and rough like in real life or unreal but look good, unfortunately its was in between both and came across as though a 10 year old had done it.\n\nUwe Boll should realise that he has no talent and only succeeds in ruining franchises so all i'm gonna say is:\n\nStop making movies your head is FUBAR.\n\n0 out of 10."

All it shows is that Hollywood will push anything out they feel will bring in more than they fronted for the production of the movie.\n\nAnd to make it worse Uwe Boll is making a movie based on the game Farcry. I like that game, please please please please do not let him destroy the idea of it with another half-baked idea of action. Michael Pare is tagged to take the lead character. No offense, but he's a little past his prime and might break a hip or something. He was good in his day, but he's not cut out to do an action flick."

It's not all the director's fault, whoever wrote the script has some blame too.

Don't waste yours either. I haven't lost this much respect for actors since Cannonball Run 2. Ben Kingsley looked like this was some form of punishment for a crime, like he was doing community service. Michael Madsen looked like he was under the influence of some kind of amnesia drug that made him forget where he was all the time.

Clear shots where even the 'dark' scenes are lit well enough as to not be challenging (I despise movies that think dark scene are supposed to be so dark you can't see anything for minutes on end). Yeah the effects and scene setups can be a little limited and sometime over the top, but that drop the movie a star, not 4, especially when you remember the time the movie was released.\n\nThis is a good watch. Not to be missed."

A few rules have been bent and thrown on top of the boring old vampire rules. Avoiding sunlight is normal. Avoiding crosses is quasi normal. The avoiding water was brand new to me. This was first time I some nocturnal dude that couldn't drink anything except blood. And coffee and orange juice, I guess. Maybe vodka and wine. But no water. At least no baths.\n\nIt was very disturbing to see the vampire thirst thing in action. They no longer have to actually suck their victims. Their fangs only have to come within three or four centimeters of their victim's neck and, PRESTO! The victim in question immediately falls unconscious, screams in agony, and otherwise dies. Watch BloodRayne to see the vampire non-contact sport.\n\nThe entire acting energy was also definitely in question. Enter Madsen. Bloodrayne says, \"Think we ought to save the world?\" Madsen kind of stares around the room, apparently looking for a better role. BloodRayne says,\"So... I guess we better go fight some bad guys, huh?\" Madsen says some deadpan line, hoping it makes him look tough, but comes across as bored. \"Well, we could just ride some more horses. That sounds like fun.\"\n\nSeeing twenty thousand gallons of blood come out of one guy would be something, but apparently everyone back then was a walking blood balloon just waiting to be popped. As one last shot, if you respect Ben Kingsley, you'll think twice after watching this flick! Enjoy!"

If you don't understand the plot line, you must be an idiot. Meatloaf was flat out da bomb and should act in more movies and should probably lose some weight.(perhaps don't want to jinx him, but could be a nominee for an Oscar, but lets not jinx him) Female characters were very good at looking hot, and acting i don't really know about because i was distracted.

        "review_detailed_main": "On its own and looked at logically, \"BloodRayne\" mostly falls apart like a house of cards in a hurricane. And even when compared to Uwe Boll's two previous efforts, \"Alone in the Dark\" and \"House of the Dead\", it's no classic. But in regard to the first scenario, it's rather fun destruction while it lasts. And in regard to the second scenario, the movie is more than passable--which, for Uwe Boll, is saying something.\n\nI'm going to be a good sport and list the good first, because there's actually quite a decent chunk of it. There won't be any spoilers here or in the bad.\n\nThe film looks good. I don't quite know how that happened, but it did. There's the slight tinge of anonymity that I've noticed with all of Boll's films so far, which is to say that a good many of the shots were flat, completely evenly lit (almost sitcom-lit), and possibly shot at a blurrier frame rate. When it matters to the movie, though, the camera actually starts moving around, the lighting becomes more pronounced, and it's a marked improvement. As a final note, the visual effects were surprisingly good all-around; a vampire ashing midway through the movie is obviously intended as only a special effect, but it looks about identical to the similar ones used in all three \"Blade\" films. The only other CG effect sequence I can recall involves what must be giant spiked pinwheels.\n\nAbout halfway through the movie, Loken's character arrives at the Brimstone Society's headquarters, and the ensuing section of the film is probably the best; each character save for one is at their peak in terms of development and actor/actress involvement, and there are actually scenes here that pick you up and carry you, however short the distance might be. In fact, the second half of \"BloodRayne\" is really where you can get a sense of what Boll was trying to do. And he succeeds, partially.\n\nThe music is a huge improvement. For once, it seems, Boll has gone with a composer, and the difference shows. Although I must confess I can't remember the rhythm of the main theme now, I do know that it stuck with me for a short time after viewing the film.\n\nAll of these are relatively minor points, except for the second one. The main reason why I kind of liked \"BloodRayne\" (and am giving it a 7) is because you can see a spark of life there, in the same way you can see it behind the screen in low-budget 1960s and 1970s monster flicks. There was effort here to try and make this a good film--more so than you could see with few other movies this year. And even the sequences that don't work (and there are a decent amount of them) have a low-rent, goofy kind of charm to them. \"BloodRayne\" is at its best in scenes like Rayne's memory of the sideshow sequence, her return to the Brimstone Society late in the film (which packs an existing if small punch that I really wasn't expecting), and a late plot point with Michelle Rodriguez's character that actually feels like it came from somewhere.\n\nI've said this before. I suppose when looking at it on its own, \"BloodRayne\" is still a bad movie. But it's so many leaps and bounds above and beyond \"Alone in the Dark\" and \"House of the Dead\" that it merits a viewing."

OK - its not a perfect movie and its not a really \"good\" movie, but it isn't that bad, the most viewers say.\n\nI think 6 point out of 10 are OK. You get 90 minutes of vampire-fantasy action and some cool gore effects powered by Olaf Ittenbach. If you are man enough to watch a movie with an average story, told in a crazy vampire-flavoured world you are right with this one. And hey - there is Michael Madsen in it. It CAN'T be bad."

This film came the closest any film ever has. I only give it a 5 because, in my book an F is an F, so why worry about if it is 50% OR 10%, it is still an F. Just the shear fact someone was able to fund, write, shoot and release a film they deserve a 5. Even a film this bad.\n\nThere are some movies which beg to ask why they were ever made. This is one of them. I do not know if Uwe Bol goes out of his way to make the worst film he can, but if this was intended to be a quality film, Uwe is in bad need of film school.\n\nPerformances are dialed in here; all for a paycheck. Michael Madsen is NOT the actor to give this tripe supposed old English dialog to. He is more at home playing the local scum, not a medieval sage. His delivery, which works in other films is totally wrong for this role. I cringed every time he spoke a line. However, I don't know if Madsen's delivery was as bad as Rodriquez's attempt at a English accent. Not since Kevin Costner's feeble attempt in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, have we been witnessed to a worse accent. But then again, one could give her marks for at least trying. But I just can't.\n\nJust an absolute terrible movie. Then we are assaulted with the Unrated version on DVD that turns up the bad gore and blood effects to the maximum. The money spent on this film was all in the locations as that is the only thing that has a faint hint of substance. The trees seen in the woods have more personality than our female lead who exhibits zero acting ability here.\n\nThe action is straight out of the movie stuntman's handbook. These painfully orchestrated action sequences are so slow and deliberate one expects to see the players mouthing the numbers to each step and swing they take.\n\nWhat the hell was Ben Kingsley thinking when he signed on for this? Though he is one of the few actors here that actually can act through anything, you still wonder what made him take this on. Another stand out is Billy Zane. He brings a much needed gusto and a realization of the limits of the piece, but by damn he is going to make the best of it anyway. Everyone else is trying to make it Shakespere which makes their performance all that much more mechanical and ludicrous.\n\nThere is always going to be someone that likes this type of stuff, more power to ya. A sequel is on the way, so SOMEONE out there liked it enough."

There are too many video games trying to be made into movies.

This movie was a waste of time, effort, and money. The only upside for this movie was uncontrollable laughter I found myself doing while watching what was suppose to be gore.

I guess I've got a soft spot for Boll, because I also really liked \"House of the Dead,\" which is equally juvenile, clich\u00e9d, and craptacular. However, this Director's cut edition of \"Bloodrayne\" had way more gore and a lot of it was pretty well done, thus earning an extra half star. If you like bad movies, Boll's ouvre is one to visit. He makes stupid, clich\u00e9d, hammy trash that just might grow a little on you...if you let it. Boll is a hack and he knows it. We know it, too, so people need to get over bashing the guy. He sucks as a director, yes. BUT THAT IS THE POINT. He makes a movie called \"Bloodrayne,\" that is based on a crappy PS2 game. Duh! Um...sorry about that little rant there.

Wrong. Very wrong.\n\nThis was quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen, mostly because of the flat story and acting. The script could have been written by a child in elementary school, it was so simple and hokey. The basic idea was all right, the whole pieces of a body make you powerful thing I mean, but how it was carried out made me go off of the horror genre for a week (am avid horror fan) just so that I could recover.\n\nAnd the acting by everyone BUT the lead actress was dumber than W. I've seen high school announcements with better acting.\n\nDon't waste your time if you are looking for something that's worth eating popcorn on a couch. Watch Carpenter's 'Vampires' instead - not a great story but still much more entertaining than this tripe."

You can see that the man really loves movies and he does what many directors do, he makes movies he wants to see. When it comes to acting it is better in this movie compared to his two previous. Kristianna Loken is really pretty good as Rayne. She takes a wooden game character and gives her life. The only two actors that makes a bad job here really is Mikael Madsen and Ben Kingsley that seems more desperate than anything else. Maybe those actors don't get that many offers anymore. The visuals and effects in this movie are very good and the music fits the movie pretty good. So, come on people. It is only because this is Uwe Boll that the movie is on the bottom 100 list. It's better than that."

After reading all the ferociously negative and vicious commentary on Uwe Boll that's been posted here, I was really curious! How could a film maker evoke so much hatred? That, combined with the fact that I'm a chick, and have never played a video game in my life, and therefore, have no past romance with the BloodRayne video game.... I went into the screening with low expectations, and was very pleasantly surprised! I really liked BloodRayne! I had a great time watching it and enjoyed the story. I thought it was well paced with lots of action, gallons of blood, and some great fight scenes! It had some beautiful location shots, and a talented and eminently watchable cast! I didn't see anything wrong with any of the actors performances. And kristanna Loken was a great treat to watch-- performing most of her own stunts and fights-- (as well as that hot jailhouse sex scene!) I think she did a really good job carrying the bulk of the film.\n\nI also had the pleasure to meet and talk extensively to Uwe Boll, and was really impressed! A nice, unaffected, hardworking, smart, very hands-on, independent producer/director! Working outside of the studio system, raising tons of funds, getting great casts, and personally involved with all the distribution and promotions-- Boll is making entertaining films AND paying his investors back with dividends! So I don't really understand all the bad reviews? It seems to me that there's a lot of malicious and unjustified hatred of Uwe Boll. I know I've seen worse films, ( hell, I've acted in worse films!) But this guy is working his ass off, and getting results!! He should be celebrated as a champion of the independent- and a shining example of the power of hard work and the ability of the individual!"

This movie seems like a first year film students aborted final exam. It's a shame since there is so much that can be done with the BloodRayne theme if it's given to someone competent. This Uwe Boll just butchered it like it was last weeks road kill. Come on Uwe, BloodRayne is supposed to be very smooth, sleek and sexy not slow, arthritic, and probably about 5 \u00bd beers shy of a six pack. Kristianna Loken was probably the ONLY good thing in T3, so where did it go wrong in this movie???? Anyway, you get the basic idea on this pile of wasted time."

His third attempt was no different. Now, I've not played the video game that this film is based on, but have seen footage and am aware of its gameplay style. Aside from the sheer amount of gore and improvised action sequences, it pretty much neglects its source material (whoa...shock!). Rayne, a cross-breed of human and vampire, joins a society that hunts down vampires so that she can kill the Vampire King who raped and killed her mother. A simple revenge plot with supernatural aesthetics, except her vengeance was dull and the vampires were weaker than outdated holy water. I have to give some praise to Boll, who does stick to a gothic style of some sort that makes this film have an identity. Sure, it's generically medieval and you shan't remember anything the next day, but it does the job. That's about all the praise I can give it. Boll is unable to direct his A-list cast, and they are able to overpower him by doing the bare minimal. Madsen literally didn't give a toss. Kingsley was thinking \"hmmm what other bad film can I be in?\" (which turns out to be 'The Love Guru'). Rodriguez, Zane and Chaplin were all just pointless. Loken actually gave the acting a go, my advice would be to give up now. And Meat Loaf, well...that entire scene was all kinds of messed up. Boll actually hired prostitutes instead of extras, he was probably thinking \"I must release my inner Hitchcock! Meat Loaf, sign this contract stating that if you get a STD that it is not my fault!\". The screenplay had no characterisation. The plot was one-dimensional and unsurprisingly lost focus many times. No seriously, there's a complete ten minute scene where she activate a booby trap and all of a sudden a quest to find three body parts commences. Basically, it's another cheap-looking TV movie that once again has a decent budget gone to waste. Boll should just not be given any money to waste..."

There are the three objects of power to be obtained, monsters that drop keys to secret doors, bystanders apathetically disregarding the heavily armed heroes as they walk by, killing things in their way, stupid guards, campy villains, etc.\n\nOccasionally, you almost expect to hear a ding accompanied by the words \"Your quest log has been updated.\"\n\nThe cast includes plenty of excellent actors, and they're all turning in pretty bad performances. Although no exception, Michael Madsen effortlessly manage to match the tone of the film with the same low-key disposition as seen in Kill Bill, among other films.\n\nHowever, the actors should not be blamed for the shortcomings of the script and the director. Since the film doesn't follow the plot of the games, it seems unlikely that much of the dialogue could have been taken from there, so maybe its just intentionally written in the corny style of computer RPG conversation; the same goes for much of the plot.\n\nBut despite all these shortcomings, I rather enjoyed the film. Ignoring the more ludicrous details of the plot, it had an engaging and entertaining storyline, along with gripping cinematography. Oh, and the occasional mix of (pretty mild) sex and horror, bizarre enough that one has to laugh.\n\nFinally, the ending caught me completely off-guard. Completely setting aside Hollywood-standards and turning the expected RPG-style ending on its head, it was almost Hamlet-esquire, an odd turn after 90 minutes of campy RPG plot.\n\nNo, BloodRayne is not the best thing to happen to cinema since The Seven Samurai. Don't be ridiculous. But was seeing this film worth the 95 minutes I spent seeing it? Yeah, I think so."

Somebody should have told the director that a convincing 18th century accent does not involve articulating each word of dialogue in a slow and jerking manner. The actors sound retarded. The special effects and sets are quite good, and the storyline has some merit. The director must have worked hard to get the very worst out of Ben Kingsley, I bet he never works for this director again!! The fight scenes are really lame. It looks like they practised a couple of times and then went to film. You can almost hear the actors saying \"er... is it me now? do I swing the sword like this?\" Hilarious. Everything was there to make a decent vampire action film. The only thing missing was talent and vision in the director."

The writing was horrible, very basic and uninspiring. Most of the characters seemed to have far too much knowledge, leaving little mystery to those not already familiar with the story as well as raising questions: If they already knew this or that, why have they not at least tried to do something about it at an earlier date? The actors all seemed stiff, bored and unimpressed with their situation. I felt no passion from them while delivering their lines. Most of the fighting sequences were poorly choreographed and made the vampires seem like a bunch of wimps. Unfortunately, this film like so many others based on comics or video games came out on the big screen looking like some college students film project rather than a professionally produced, written and directed effort. This sadly was one of those films that I walked out of the theater thinking, \"Wow! I wish I could have that part of my life back.\""

As the saying goes \"There are only 7 types of stories and all writers are just copying from Shakespeare\", Bloodrayne copies Blade with average results. Uwe Boll is obviously taking the whole stuff very seriously, which results in somewhat laughable moments where Blade's \"making fun of himself\" helps release the pressure, but it wasn't a waste of time for me.\n\nDon't expect much jaw-dropping parts, although some scenes did make me say \"wow, never seen this before, that was cool!\" (introduction of BR, BR getting the first relic)."

        "review_detailed_main": "Uwe Bolle seems to be trying so hard to combine elements from the swords-and-sorcery and exploitation genres that he forgets all about making a vampire movie. The result is dismal.\n\nThis movie is initially reminiscent of fantasy schlock like Dungeons and Dragons, complete with that stilted dialogue that's meant to sound \"period\" but comes off more like as a 3rd-grade class play: \"I will go over there. You will follow me. We can not allow ourselves to be seen. I must not lose my lunch over this lame script.\"\n\nThere's really nothing good to say about the acting in this stinker - even Ben Kingsley looks embarrassed, as he should. Michael Madsen looks like an overweight has-been from a bad 80s hair band; or maybe he's just trying to upstage Meat Loaf. Even Kristanna has a little pooch, and the camera direction deftly calls attention to it several times throughout the movie.\n\nThe utterly gratuitous and over-the-top graphic depictions of dismemberment and mutilation are better suited to the exploitation/zombie genre than this this attempt at mainstream adventure. In one scene we see about four people hacking the limbs off a very dead and disemboweled foe - in the middle of a pitched battle, mind you. Geez, you'd think you'd have other priorities when there's live sword-wielding enemies all around than chopping a harmless corpse into progressively smaller pieces.\n\nUwe Bolle is evidently so proud of his gross-out scenes that he actually revisits them in a five-minute montage at the end of the movie. Get over yourself, Uwe; Tom Savini's effects in Dawn of the Dead were better, and that was almost 30 years ago."

I give credit to Uwe Boll for taking on the task of bringing in a video game to film but he should do more work on the casting of the film and the dialog. People acted as if they didn't really mean the lines they said and it felt like there were reading off a page behind the camera.\n\nI have no idea what sort of setting he his trying to get at. The characters voices and images did not match the setting of the film. They all had their own accent i.e. Michael Madsen (American), Michelle Rodriguez (Spanish/American), Kristanna Loken (American), Ben Kingsley (English/U.K.). It also seemed that the characters did not really fit their role. It was hard to connect with Kristanna Loken and her being Bloodrayne. I had the expectation that she was going to be more attractive and seductive like other female vampires have been portrayed in other movies.\n\nI compare this movie to some of the cheaper Hong Kong Films that are produced on an annual basis. The blood and gore in the movie was quite prevalent. There were two sex/nudity scenes in the movie that were really quite unnecessary and were not built up very well. It was nudity for the sake of nudity. Some of the camera angles could have been better. And for the final thing that was bad, the ending. If you are expecting something great don't get your hopes up.\n\nI hope Uwe Boll does better on his next film as this movie could of had more direction and attention to detail to make it better."

It's a lot of fun, it's over-the-top action.\"\n\nThis is a quote by Uwe Boll. While yes, he's talking about House of the Dead and not Bloodrayne (more on that later), it should be noted that I don't think he actually has played any of the video games he's directed. And who hasn't? Most video game-to-film movies are so far away from the actual plot that they often make no sense, B-to-Z movie film quality, and the question continues as to why this man hasn't been stopped. It's amazing to think that he's still making movies that hardly make back my own 35 cents.\n\nDon't see this movie. Go play the game, the real deal, and be the judge of it yourself.

        "review_detailed_main": "Oh, Uwe Boll.\n\nIt's honestly a shame that he announced he's retiring from directing. ...no, seriously. I mean that.\n\nYes, the man has essentially become the butt of many a joke online and is perhaps the most widely derided and ridiculed of minds in cinema in the last twenty years. And yes, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a part of that... indeed I was. I've written a number of cynical and dismissive reviews of his work. But I can't say that I don't admire the man to a certain extent. He's a passionate filmmaker and a man who loves his work- this much is evident. He wanted to be a director, and by god, he succeeded to at least some extent. And despite my negative comments, I think it's pretty evident that even when I didn't enjoy his work in its intended fashion, I still found great entertainment value in his catalog of films. I wouldn't be watching and discussing them still if I didn't. Granted, it was generally unintended comedic value, but still, I had great fun following his career. And I was always pleasantly surprised by the occasional flash of brilliance that would pop up here and there.\n\nSo yes, I do think that it is a shame we may never again get to see an Uwe Boll film.\n\n...but enough of that. Let's discuss \"BloodRayne\", shall we?\n\nOne of Boll's earlier stinkers, 2005's \"BloodRayne\" was his third major theatrical release- at least counting his streak of wide-releases that started with \"House of the Dead\", and ignoring his earlier lower- budget roots. And coincidentally, it was also his third video-game to film adaptation, taking loose inspiration from the popular hack-and-slash action-adventure franchise of the same name. And while it is perhaps the most competent of his first fistfull of video-game movies, it's also a prime example of vintage-Boll insanity. Rife with nonsensical inconsistencies, amusing miscasting and plot-holes aplenty, it's definitely a very fun watch for fans of trashy, low- brow B-movies, and would make for a good \"movie night\" with a group of friends and lots of beer!\n\nKristanna Loken stars as \"Rayne\", a half-human and half-vampire \"damphir\" who escapes from her life as a side-show freak and takes refuge with the Brimstone Society- a group of vampire hunters lead by Vladmir. (Michael Madsen) Together, they must stand up to a common enemy- Rayne's vile vampire lord father Kagen (Ben Kingsley), who seeks to take over the world using ancient artifacts that will grant him untold power.\n\nTo give some credit where it is due, the film has a few inspired moments and some fun sequences that are uncommonly well-done in comparison to Boll's early work. While half-baked and far too abbreviated, the early sequences revolving around Rayne's exploitation at the hands of a circus freakshow are well-conceived and give a nice bit of sympathy to the character. There's a fun little sub-plot with singer/actor Meat Loaf Aday that comes unexpectedly and will provide a few minor beats of suspense. And Kingsley is a lot of fun to watch with his weirdly monotone yet oddly threatening take on a devious vampire lord.\n\nHowever, the rest of the film tends to fall flat on his face. Stars Loken, Madsen and an inexplicable Michaelle Rodriguez are all ludicrously miscast and seem in over their heads, leading to many unintended laughs. In particular Madsen, who I'm pretty sure is either heavily intoxicated or deathly tired in most of his scenes. He takes \"phoning it in\" to a whole new level. The action set-pieces are cringe-worthy in all the best ways, with some of the worst gore- effects and fight choreography I've ever seen in a major release. (Be prepared to double-over in a fit of laughter every time a sword is unsheathed.) Camera-work alternates between bland and flat from one scene to overly intricate and over-stylized in the next, giving it an inconsistent tone. And the actual aesthetic quality on display is on-par with a bad 90's soap opera.\n\nOh, and did I mention nonsensical writing? Because the film is filled to burst with it. Story goes screenwriter Guinevere Turner, a talented artist in her own right, was sort-of bullied by Boll into turning in a crappy, first-pass rough-draft ahead of schedule. And instead of giving her time to fix it up with a second draft like most producer/directors do, he just took it as it was and ran with it, casually re-writing huge portions of dialog and story himself (despite not speaking English all that well) and tossing out pages left and right without discrimination. And good lord, does it show! The script as-is is just brilliant in its sheer incompetence.\n\nAll in all, if you're a Boll addict like I am and you somehow haven't seen \"BloodRayne\", you really owe it to yourself to check it out. It's just so much fun in all the wrong ways. It's poorly written. Atrociously acted. Mind-bogglingly directed. And it is most certainly great entertainment in that wonderful, campy \"so bad, it's good\" kinda way. As a film itself, it's a 3 out of 10. As a piece of unintentional entertainment, however? It's pure gold. And it's a prime example of what I'll miss now that Boll is supposedly gone forever. We'll miss you, Uwe. We might not have liked your films the way you wanted... but we got a kick out of them nonetheless!"

I can't disagree with criticisms that the acting was generally disappointing, especially Loken (who, overall really was quite awful), but I emphasise 'disappointing' rather than 'poor' because of two reasons. 1) the name actors may have been phoning in their performances and be poor by their own standards but for Rodriguez, Kingsly and Madsen even a phoned in performance is significantly better than many normal B-movie actors at their best and 2) given the script they had to work with no actor could have done much better! Yes, the script, the real villain of the piece ... (very bad) olde Englishe deliberately stilted phrasing and occasional modern-style one-liners are mashed together to produce some very poor dialogue, at times jarringly so, which really does not help us or the actors. I honestly think if the writing had been just a bit better the film would have benefited monumentally; much better and I think Uwe Boll might gain some converts to his cause! On to the rest of the film; the plot is not bad at all, if a little daft in places - some overlaps with the game (which I don't know) I could guess at as they were such 'gamey' concepts but at least that meant Mr Boll was trying a bit. The CGI and special effects are not ILM but are more than adequate, never really jarring and sometimes pretty good - though the (unexplained) montage at the end seem to suffer in that either they used 'longer cuts' of scenes from the film or the lack of score meant you looked more closely and were not 'caught up' because in the original sequences the make-up and prosthetics didn't look quite so obvious! The action is better than the average B-Movie with most fight scenes looking pretty good, the gore is very gory (I watched the Unrated version so don't know how much was cut for the R-Rated one), the naked women were very pretty and the ubiquitous sex scene (that admittedly seemed to appear from nowhere) was nicely done. So in conclusion, if you're looking at the cast and expecting top notch performances and associated high quality movie making, then you *will* be very disappointed. If you can get past some stilted dialogue and you're after a no-brainer B-movie with some fun, violent action and a few naked and topless women give it a try!"

The costumes are pretty interesting, the sets are not bad, and it mercifully ended after only 95 minutes.\n\nWhy was this movie made?

Out of the millions of movies I have seen in my life, this is, without a doubt, one of the bottom 5. I usually even like the ones that get bad revues, but this one did not lie. The story was ridiculous, and very badly written. The fighting was ridiculously boring. The blood and such was even fake and badly special-effected. The acting was boring and emotionless, even the popular people. Kingsly, Madsen, and Rodriguez were definitely novices in this movie. There was NO pre-explanations. We were left wondering what was going on. The ending was horridly thought out as simple. I would not recommend this to ANYONE. I am so glad I only rented it. I would have thrown it out if I had bought it. Awful! Not worth it to rent."

        "review_detailed_main": "Uwe Boll is regarded as being one of the worst film makers of all time. Having seen a few of his movies (Far Cry, Bloodrayne, Rampage, Final Storm) I can say that although he is a terrible director not all of his movies live up to the awful hype. One of the few movies of him that does though is Bloodrayne. Bloodrayne is sinfully dull, and any interest that could be put into the movie is squashed from it being painful to watch. The only way that you could ever actually see this movie and not fall asleep would be if you made a conscious effort not to fall asleep while watching it. The worst part about this movie is that Uwe Boll actually managed to tarnish the careers of otherwise respectable actors such as Ben Kingsley. Despite some criticisms I also like Michelle Rodriguez and thought she was wasted as well. The worst part about this movie is that it is fairly forgettable as well. So if you hope to watch it to find a unintentionally funny scene or to get any entertainment out of it then keep looking."

This movie is bad cinema and if you go into it thinking that you're going to be entertained in the way that you've been entertained by other better made summer blockbusters you're going to be disappointed. THis is no ordinary film, don't expect it to be. Now this one clearly isn't Boll's masterpiece, parts of it are sheer brilliance, but it falters here and there.

You have great actors and a horrible director. Some actors can stand on their own through a bad director.

I really wanted to give this movie a chance, but I gave up around the time they brought in Meat Loaf.\n\nI'm sure everyone's heard about this train-wreck of a movie already, so I won't go too deep into the critique other than to say that Uwe Boll wouldn't know a good movie if it ripped his nuts off and shoved them up his backside. Assuming, of course, he can take his head out of it long enough to make the room.\n\nHow anyone can take actors that are at worst, 'decent' and continuously ruin their careers with this...CRAP...is beyond me. Who the hell keeps giving this guy money? Have any of these actors ever ~seen~ a Uwe Boll movie? The actors in these films have lost any and all respect I have ever had for them; there is simply no excuse for it. Either you're kissing his butt, desperate for any kind of movie role, actually ~like~ this crap, or don't have a clue and have an ego so big that you feel you alone can save it based on just presence.\n\n*sigh* No amount of groaning or bad-mouthing will every justify the SUCK that is Uwe and anything he lays eyes on, let alone makes.

However when placed in comparison with there other 'bigger' movies, Bloodrayne does not seems that bad.\n\nFirst the cinematography is quite decent. Better than most movies. The action scenes are OK, nothing spectacular but better than most with plenty or blood and gore. The music is terrible. They have the same music for every scene, however different the mood is. If they had removed the music, the movie is 10x more enjoyable (which is why i think those watching in the cinemas will definitely hate it more than those watching at home, whom have the option of lowering down the volume) The acting are terrible, though i feel its not their fault. Feels like the director only had 1 take to save time and money and probably gave the actors the freedom to act as they wish (who would take directions from Uwe Boll). This probably explains why different actors act out in different styles (Billy Zane as though he is in a comedy, Kristanna Loken as though she is in a drama, Michael Madson as though he is in an drunken orgy and Michelle Rodriguez as though she is still in 'Lost'). Kristanna looks the part (so gorgeous and sexy that you are willing to be bitten by her) but she need help with her delivery of her lines. Give her some time and good help, she probably will turn out to be a decent actress.\n\nThe story have a few plot holes (but who really cares about the story). If Uwe Boll was not the director this movie probably would have received a better review. Better than AeonFlux (a MAJOR disappointment) but not as fun as Ultraviolet. Kristanna is sexier than both actress (it helps that she has quite an explicit sex scene although its a bit sad that she showed the most emotions in that scene).\n\n5/10 in comparison with other heroine movies out there."

It would prove more of a challenge to find something positive to say about Bloodrayne than taking a masters in quantum physics. I saw this nightmare on a Pc. (No one shall say I paid to watch the crap). House of the Dead and Alone in the Dark, two of Uwe Bolls other blunder ups had already left me with deep scars in my soul. So I guess I had it coming. It seem rather pointless to analyze this excuse for a movie because there isn't much to analyze. The part most people remember or feel worth talking about is the sex scene. Which explains a lot. Even that wasn't remotely decent. The breasts of Kristanna Loken just ain't gonna cut it as long Uwe Boll is lurking behind the camera. Nor will anything else. And I can't for the life of me phantom why Michael Madsen which I think of as an decent actor would diminish him self by accepting a part in this garbage. Is quick money the only reason, then buddy, this isn't going to help your career. Michelle Rodriguez was I felt, the only one who gave the impression of at least trying. But only A list actors can carry a movie by them selves. But no cosmic power could carry Bloodrayne anywhere.\n\nUwe Boll has threaten the world with upcoming game to movie project like Far Cry, Postal, and Dungeon Siege. At least he was tuned down brutal and hard by the people behind the master piece Metal Gear Solid. (There is a god). If one really want to waste money and time on crap movies I rather see an Ed Woods movie. At least he was in a bizarre way somewhat good at being bad."

        "review_detailed_main": "Movie wasn't as bad most people say it is. Yes, it's not the best movie (BY VERY FAR), but it is one of the better bad movies put there. Compared to his U.S. debut film, House Of The Dead, he's come around quite a bit. Sure, the gore scenes were odd and comical to watch at a point, but having played the BloodRayne games themselves, it actually matches up fairly well. The concept of the game battles are usually dismemberment and blood everywhere; in other words, over the top and tedious at some point. Same thing in the movie. Not a good point for the movie, but it's also something acceptable about it.\n\nHowever, the problem with the fight scenes is not the gore; it's the props. Yes, the props. The swords look bulky and dull. Another problem with fighting is that we've seen some of the shots in other movies. In the final fight, two men hit their swords together, with one breaking the conflict by punching his opponent. This shot previously appeared in the lava battle in Star Wars Episode 3. Yet another shot used is the 'Scorpion Kick' that Kingsly is hit by. This shot was in the two Matrix sequels. The end result are fight scenes which seem 'cheeseball'. The CGI effects blend and don't blend continuously throughout the film. A good example is the 'Entering the castle' shot. The exterior of the castle looks believable, but the gargoyle entrance doesn't look like it can exist.\n\nAnd yes, there are many inconsistencies between the games and the movie, but what video game movie HASN'T been inconsistent with it's game counterpart? I don't believe Lara Croft rode on a Jetski in a bikini in any game, nor did any Hunters or the Tyrant appear in either of the Resident Evil movies. (And don't go into Nemesis being a Tyrant.) No character by the name of 'Alice' exists in any RE games.\n\nOf course, a bad flaw in this movie was the acting. Ben Kingsly's dialog about sending his warriors after Rayne seems so incredibly dry and literally sounds like it was read off of a script because it sounds so flat. The 'sex scene' does seem out of place, not in the context of the movie, but in the context of the scene. It seems so random that it makes the viewer feel bored. There's no sense of sexual tension between the characters, and so it feels as though it could have been left out entirely, or at least put in after some new character tweaks. Madsen seems believable, but at the same time not. His looks and acting often offset his appearance, either one outweighing the other in many scenes. Meat Loaf's appearance was actually pretty cool, even though it was quite brief. Loken was another believable character, as was Rodriguez.\n\nFor those who found the ending to be odd, it was. Rayne seems to hate mankind, but throughout the movie she is aided by humans and seems to only hate vampires. Although one could say that she hates both, because of the story so far, the scene once again feels misplaced.\n\nMany people vote on this and other Boll movies based on what they have heard from others without actually seeing the film. People also vote on what they think it SHOULD be, not what it is. Obviously, if you're going to see BloodRayne, you should be expecting to see a bloody, gory movie, in which case it delivered. But what's the saddest is something that Mr. Boll has pointed out; this movie was down voted by hundreds of people before it's initial release. Limited advance screenings were shown worldwide, and I seriously doubt that most people who down voted it before it's initial release saw the movie, just the trailer (IF that). What I'm saying is that it's all well and good to dislike his work, just at least give it a chance before you start to critique in a negative or positive way. All in all though, this was a decent movie that will appeal to game fans and those looking for a large amount of gore."

I use the term effort lightly since both cast and crew obviously did not really try at all. I liked the underworld films, despite their sometimes thin story, and logical errors because they were well made graphically and that made them entertaining. In Bloodrayne the actors didn't even bother to phone it in, they have simply put smileys and emoticons on the script and faxed it through their agents. It is absolutely ridiculous the way they sometimes try to speak with an accent, and other times just give up mid sentence. Had the dielog had some kind of substance to it I might not have noticed. The fight scenes are also some of the least impressive i have seen, ever. They look like something you would see on the History channel, when they try to remake roman battles using overeager enthusiasts and shooting it on High 8. Now, all of this could have been tolerated had there been some dialog or a story that sometimes made sense in there somewhere, but there just isn't. They also put in one of the dumbest sex scenes i have ever seen in there. Although you get to see Lokens tits for a while, it's just embarrassing. What the hell are all those known actors doing in this movie? Did the production team spend 98% of the budget on the actors and left the rest to chance and good faith? It seems so!"

After watching it, I wonder how in the world did these great actors and actresses get sucked into making this movie as its an embarrassment to their talents. It certainly did no good to further their careers. I may sound harsh, but this movie was on the level or close to that of a very low budget amateur film. If you're looking to waste money on this movie, feel free to rent it. I strongly don't recommend buying it at all."

        "review_detailed_main": "As a movie made from a video game (that wasn't very good in the first place, BTW) BloodRayne delivers. It has a plot which actually makes a bit of sense, it has Kristanna Loken who has my respect for the role in Ring of the Nibelungs (and she looks so hot my eyes burn), but most of all it makes Michael Madsen look good, which is not so easy to do.\n\nThe cast is full of TV series and B movies actors: Michael Madsen, Billy Zane, Udo Kier, Michelle Rodriguez, Meat Loaf, even Michael Pare. But most amazingly, Ben Kingsley has the role of the ubervampire. I know he is old and all, but what did he expect to get from this movie? Long last acting recognition? I thought Will Sanderson made a good role, even if a small one, but after his 34 movies and TV appearances he should, anyway.\n\nOK, putting Kristanna Loken in action sequences with swords doesn't really pay off. She is an athletic woman, but can't really move heavy metal things. The fights are all a bit confusing and not very realistic, but at least they are not full of fake CGI, which is a plus. This is a bloody movie, but it doesn't really show more than red dye, there are no severed limbs or visible internal organs. Also, not all the good guys survive, which is a nice change from the routine.\n\nBottom line: it was way more than I expected and did a hell lot more from the tiny budget it had than a lot of high budget crappy monster movies. It is better than Doom (but what movie isn't?) and better than Aeon Flux or Ultraviolet or any other recent female-action-hero movie."

It plods along never reaching any kind of pitch above a yawn. Loken was so poorly cast its shocking, she looks 10 years to old to play rayne and clearly has NO sword skills. The montage of training clearly displays this. If thats how good she is at the end of her training they would have been better off sending a 10 year old who has watched too many episodes of power rangers in to do battle with the bad guys. The kid coulda ended this film a lot quicker! What were kingsley and Madsen thinking when they agreed to do this??? Money problems I'm thinking. You'd need to be in serious dept to lower yourself to this. I'd become a rent boy before being in a uwe boll movie.\n\nThe budget must have been so low. There is a scene where a small armada of boats head towards the brimstone headquarters, and you think \"here we go a good battle scene to lift this toss out of the mud\" alas no. The battle is never seen, instead a lone survivor clambers ashore and explains that there was a huge battle, but you missed it. The weapons also are as convincing as you'd get in a pound shop. Raynes weapons appear so pointless (literally) that they wouldn't cut butter. This was probably because all involved are so bad at sword fighting they would have hurt themselves otherwise.\n\nDo not see this film. It will anger you just how easy it would have been to make this film better.\n\nNote to all game license companies: DO NOT LET UWE BOLL MAKE YOUR GAME INTO A MOVIE!"

The script well, I don't know who thought that stinking pile was worthwhile needs to be fired. The lines were worse than the lines of any video game I've played. The special effects were awful and the blood in the film reminded me of something from Monty Python and the Holy Grail where blood just squirts from wounds. I don't know why the director is allowed to make a second film because the first one is just horrible. It's cheesy, poorly acted and again, the SE are some of the worst I've seen.

Bloodrayne, on the other hand, sees the director at his worst, the film proving virtually unwatchable despite an impressive supporting cast (Michael Madsen, Michelle Rodriguez, Billy Zane, Ben Kingsley, Udo Kier, Meat Loaf, Michael Par\u00e9), gore effects by German splatter-meister Olaf Ittenbach, and a gratuitous topless scene from its sexy star Kristanna Loken.\n\nLoken plays a half-vampire/half-human pair of breasts called Bloodrayne, who, with the help of a group of vampire slayers, seeks revenge on Kagan (Kingsley), the bloodsucking fiend who raped and killed her mother. This simplistic plot is told in such a convoluted manner that it soon becomes virtually incomprehensible. Boll commands wooden performances from all involved and employs a plethora of irritating, gimmicky film-making techniques, reducing Ittenbach's gore effects to blink-and-miss-it splashes of red (although the unrated director's cut shows much more of these in an end-of-movie montage), rendering the action dull and lifeless, and obscuring Loken's butt with a table during her sex scene.\n\nThis terrible film has since spawned two sequels (Loken wisely handing over her role to Natassia Malthe), both courtesy of Boll, and both of which have terrible ratings on IMDb. Can't say that I'm very surprised.\n\n2.5/10, very generously rounded up to 3 for the OTT splatter in the Unrated version."

        "review_detailed_main": "Uwe Boll haters need not apply.\n\nFor a horror movie, an exploited genre filled with too many unwatchable direct-to-video cash-in attempts to name, \"Bloodrayne\" isn't half bad and will amuse viewers, not expecting an Oscar nominee, for its 95 minute duration. With a star-driven cast like Kristanna Loken, Michelle Rodriguez, Matthew Davis, Ben Kingsley, Michael Madsen, Billy Zane, Meat Loaf, and Michael Par\u00e9, one would expect that Bloodrayne can't be all that bad because of its actor power, right? Wrong. Kristanna Loken (\"Terminator 3\") seems to be the only actor of the lifeless and one-dimensional cast who puts any enthusiasm and believability into her role. Michelle Rodriguez creatively stretches herself to new acting heights by playing a tough, streetwise Latina swashbuckler, somehow Michael Madsen manages to reprise a 17th century vampire hunter version of Budd from \"Kill Bill\" (but with a cue-card reading performance), and even the mighty Sir Ben Kingsley seems very uninspired and just going through the motions as the movie's villain, Kagan.\n\nThe plot is very simple and predictable. Rayne, a dhamphir (half-human/half vampire), was fathered by the evil Kegan, ruler of all vampires, only to watch her mother raped and killed before her eyes by him as a child. Rayne is now on a mission of revenge, but first must stop Kegan from obtaining the last two vampire relics of power that will plunge the world into eternal darkness.\n\nWhy Uwe Boll's script writers feel the need to totally change the story lines of video game to movie adaptations is totally beyond me and a key ingredient for box office failure because, after all, people go to see video game movies to see their beloved favorites expanded on, not totally rewritten. With as much excess blood and gore as there was in this movie, we all know how much more interesting and just plain cool it would have been to seen the original Bloodrayne versus World War II Nazis plot So, what saves this movie? Is it Kristanna's sexiness and exposed golden globes? No. For me, it is the technical superiority of this film over Boll's previous video game adaptations. It's not even so much the Dracula-like storyboard ambiance, but the very nice CGI and special effects. There is definitely no lack of spraying blood and flying limbs in this movie, and that equals fun in a Peter Jackson's \"Dead Alive\" way. It's not even gross-out entertainment as it is more \"that was a damn cool fatality\" enjoyment. The fight and swordplay choreography isn't even particularly impressive, but Bloodrayne still manages to be one slick-looking movie in which I never found myself bored! As far as extras, \"Bloodrayne\" offers movie commentary with Boll and Loken, a dinner interview with Uwe Boll, and the PC version of Bloodrayne 2. Now the dinner, that consisted of Thai carryout and wine with a male and female interviewer from the video game industry, did last a bit long (at least 45 minutes). In this portion, we learn of Boll's humble beginnings, his take on the current movie-video game industries, and his upcoming projects. To Boll's defense, even though he has gained a little more control with each film, he has written none of his movie scripts. Why all the video game movies? Boll is constantly being approached to direct new ones, and he seems very happy in the video game genre in spite of all the negative criticism. \"Dungeon Siege\" is his next upcoming movie (with some of the Bloodrayne cast returning), and his next projects are \"Farcy\", \"Postal\", and possibly \"Fear Effect\" and \"Hitman\". We also learn that Lion's Gate is sitting on an ultra-violent version of \"Alone on the Dark\" that reportedly did very well in Germany.\n\nSo, if the topic \"fifty new ways to hack vampires and slash human trash\" sounds interesting to you, \"Bloodrayne\" is definitely worth a rental. If you go into this movie close-minded, already expecting to hate it, you will hate it; so, don't waste your time. I, for one, don't regret buying the DVD and found the price of admission worth the fun.\n\n\"Nosferatu, I suggest a new strategy; let the Dhamphir win because they are known to rip vampires to shreds.\" - Me"

Nothing about this movie could mislead you into thinking it would be funny.\n\nAnyone who criticizes this movie for having half-naked women running around in the Dark Ages is insane. The whole point of fantasy is that women can run around half naked. Conan, Hercules, Xina, and many other sources prove that I am right. Not to mention that this is based on a video game. If this is based on the video game in any way, it is based on the fact that the main character will be scantily clad.\n\nSomeone said they saw this at the movie theater. I didn't even know it made it to the movie theater. I never heard of it until recently. That person also paid $5.75 to see it. That is a heck of a deal. Good luck paying less than $10 to go to the movie theater where I live.\n\nThis movie is getting much worse ratings than movies that I would find to be a waste of time such as Dungeons and Dragons (3.7/10), Dungeons and Dragons 2 (5/10), and Angel of Death (4/10)."

I was expecting this movie to be bad but the second half of the movie just fell apart. The things that I found terrible with this movie are ending, the beginning and the control the director is supposed have was not present when i watched this movie. I recommend that you do not waste your money watching this movie when there are better ones. I also watched another Uwe Boll movie and the same lack of using and control were also not present. I really think this movie deserves a one but since it was entertaining for about 5 minutes I'll give it a 3."

The only consolation was the attempt of Michelle Rodiguez.\n\nI know a little bit about the game, I did not spend a lot of time on it though. However, in the movie, story seems to be half, or it is so scrappy that it is impossible to put it together. Violence and the fighting is unnatural and sometimes looks ridiculous. Moreover, there is no real scenario to criticize, which makes the story and the explanations more confusing.\n\nAnd sex scene... I guess, producers and the director got together and decided that the only way that people would watch \"Bloodrayne\" is that sexy Kristianna would have sex. Although the sex scene was somehow fun to watch, they are so wrong that it would make the movie \"watchable\":)\n\nI only can say that if you wonder how sloppy and bad a movie can be, this is your movie."

In the vid game Rayne has the ability to seduce her targets--was the director trying to show that, or did his woman just not give him any that week so he decided to take it out on his poor actors? Watching that scene, I kept waiting for a hunky delivery guy to show up with a midget and a donkey and a bad jazz tune to start playing in the background. I think I've seen better sex scenes in Gang Bang B!tches 2. Hell, I wouldn't laud my talents to anybody but I think even **I've** done better a better sex scene! Don't even get me started on the ending. Anyone who can figure out what that was supposed to be all about is MENSA material.

It's not personal as Mr. Uwe Boll has been saying lately, there's no conspiracy against his movies: they are just awful. I've given Mr. Uwe Boll every chance in the book and saw 3 of his movies. Result: mediocrity in every single aspect of making movies. The fact that you use video game scripts to lure a bigger audience is just pathetic. That's why I say movie theaters should offer 100% refund in some cases. It's movies like this that promotes piracy: people feel so frustrated after spending 7,6 or 5 dls to see something that doesn't deserve even a penny. Even if it was downloaded it would be a waste of bandwidth. If you like movies and you wanna support the REAL artists, don't see this movie and if you do, ask for a refund at your rental store or movie theater."

The writers really should be shot. This looks like something that my little sister threw together in high school for a history class. I am certainly surprised that Sir Ben Kingsley would dare let his name be associated with something so dreadful. I suppose this goes to show that having big names is no substitution for a well written script. For example, Band of Brothers was fantastic and contained almost no big names. This could have been well done if they had stuck to the original storyline of the game, which was excellent, instead of writing a new and awkward plot. Nothing matched aside from names. Not even the setting or the timing matched. This was not Bloodrayne--just a movie with similar characters."

If only because at least he got a good-looking actress to play Rayne. However, Uwe, tits and gore do not a good movie make. Especially when we can tell the the dead bodies are rubber every time they're struck with a sword. Or course good movies like Saw, have been made in less time, so perhaps it is just the director.

        "review_detailed_main": "A half-vampire named Rayne (played by the lovely Kristanna Loken) joins forces with Vladimir (Michael Madsen) and Katarin (Michelle Rodriguez) to do battle against her evil father, the full vampire Kagan (Ben Kingsley). Udo Kier, Billy Zane and Meat Loaf also appear.\n\nI usually try to stay away from Uwe Boll films, which are notoriously awful. This one is no exception, considered by many to be one of the 100 worst films ever made (though somehow good enough to warrant a Boll-directed sequel in the Old West). But on the day I watched it I craved a horror film (and White Castle) and this was the only one available. Feel free to have pity on me (and send me White Castle).\n\nWhat bothers me is that this should have been a good movie. The cast is incredible (Ben Kingsley? Michael Madsen? Billy Zane? Udo Kier?) with the exception of Michelle Rodriguez, who I could speak epithets about for hours. The writing seems respectable, as there is plot development, character depth and an overall decent story to be found here with a rich mythology. But the train crashes on the way to the station.\n\nThe dialog is really bad. The conversations themselves are probably okay, but the way they are delivered is just too much like theater. Maybe talking like Shakespeare works for \"Hamlet\", but it doesn't work in a vampire film. It makes everyone look inexperienced, despite some of these people being seasoned, award-winning actors.\n\nThe directing and composition are also just plain bad. Flashbacks are put in at inappropriate times (you don't need to show us the attack on Rayne's mother every twenty minutes) and the actions was directed as a cross between an action film, a comedy and a martial arts exploitation film. I enjoy excessive blood, but there's a right way and a wrong way to do it. The way it's done here is reminiscent of \"Kill Bill\", and not in a good way. A sword slash on the chest will not release a geyser of crimson Kool-Aid. My bloodlust isn't satiated by such comical displays.\n\nMy bet is if you remake this film with a different director but the exact same script, you could get a film that is praised and admired by genre fans. As I've said, the plot was good. There's plenty of action, and a good spin on the classic vampire story (as well as the timeless revenge story). The only thing this film really had going for it was a decent sex scene, which is hardly enough to give it a positive review (though Loken is beautiful and will be missed in the sequel).\n\nDon't see this film, unless you want a really bad film to annoy you during a drinking expedition. I'm pleased that I had a tall whiskey to help me through this. Apart from the small role filled by Billy Zane (whose acting is cheesy, but in an endearing way) I have no love for this film. Expect it soon in the five dollar bin at Wal-Mart."

When I took a bathroom break, I was tempted to open the window and escape!\n\nI have a huge issue with this one thing: Uwe Boll should not be making movies! He should be restricted to making those eye-rolling fan videos on YouTube. Because when he makes a movie, it's destined to smell worse than month-old roadkill in a California desert!\n\nKristanna Loken is a very obnoxious actress. In fact, I think the only reason why she has ever been in anything is because of her looks (which I don't even appreciate). Ben Kingsley, one of the most respected thespians in the world, is actually worse than her, though, because you know he has talent. Meat Loaf is another nightmare, who spends all his time rubbing up against nude women.\n\nAnd since when is Billy Zane a \"special appearance\"?!\n\nTerrible music, gut-wrenchingly-bad cinematography, and (and I cannot stress this enough) ****lousy**** performances!!\n\nI will leave you with a quote from an episode of \"Futurama\" that is appropriate here. \"There's a suicide booth in the food court-- though there's a line....\" (from \"Xmas Story\")"

        "review_detailed_main": "Granted that this 2005 movie adaptation of a game with the same name, then take it for what it is: an Uwe Boll directed movie version of what I assume is a game that he enjoys. There is nothing more to it, and you get exactly what you would expect here.\n\nThe story in \"BloodRayne\" is about Rayne (played by Kristanna Loken), a dhampir (half human, half vampire) living in humiliation in a traveling carnival. When a blood-lust consumes her, she escapes at the cost of several carnival members. Now free from captivity, Rayne sets out to find and kill the vampire that killed her mother.\n\nRight, well, at least it is a storyline so simple that everyone can follow it. And the simplicity of the storyline also prevents the audience to be thrown any plot twists or surprises. Yes, this is as scripted and generic as it can be.\n\nWhat does work in favor of \"BloodRayne\" is the cast ensemble, as they did have some fairly familiar names and faces here. The cast included Kristanna Loken, Michael Madsen, Udo Kier, Billy Zane, Michelle Rodriguez and Ben Kingsley. So in that aspect they did have some big enough names to the cast list. How they managed to recruit them for a project such as this is just beyond my comprehension.\n\nAside from a very scripted storyline, then the action sequences in the movie were rigid and poorly executed. It was toe-curling to watch Kristanna Loken trying to pass as skilled with two blades. The only one whom did manage to put on a convincing performance in the fight sequences was Michelle Rodriguez.\n\n\"BloodRayne\" is essentially one of those movies that came from a computer game that should never have seen the light of day, as the transition to movie was just awful. This is the type of movie that you watch once, then bag and tag it, most likely never to watch it ever again."

        "review_detailed_main": "Where should I start!? Bloodrayne is one of my favorite games. Albeit, it is probably a lower quality, and has a fair share of glitches, I do indeed like the characters and the plot line.\n\nThis is an example of a terrible movie. Honestly, the director/writer (Boll)must just have known that there was a Vampire chick by the name of Rayne who doesn't like water - that seems to be where the similarities end.\n\nIn the game there where Werewolf/Liken creatures. It was set in the time of Automobiles and Nazis (30's /40's), while the movie was set in a Medieval... There was a plague in the game, which was not even mentioned in the movie! At the end of the game you face your main objective to defight some giant guy, again not mentioned in the movie, let alone based off the plot line of the movie, among with another leader/boss vampire guy (whos name also have forgotten)... You also fight lots of other 'bosses' like some slutty nurse lady that makes the plaugued people.\n\nRayne she is by herself the hole time, with no sidekicks, just some references of her clan thing! You also meet a person who betrays her, a vampire and named Myn'c who plays as a friend of Raynes till the end of the game.\n\nOne of the worst parts is that she doesn't have sex with the guy, let alone meet him. As far as the details go behind her history, I wasn't aware she came from a circus!\n\nUnderstand where I am headed. The game of alright. Maybe not many peoples cup of tea, but I enjoyed both it and the plot line. If you have watched this terrible series that Boll has created, play the games for yourself and compare. Very little similarities, enough where I wish what I was watching would not have been given remotely the same name!"

I tend to migrate to sub-par B-C movies because they don't have the hype and influence of the media if they are supported by a strong story line, excellent effects, or impressive moments. (for example, Hostel 2 wasn't as good as people had hope but I loved it because it was influence by 1970s Italian horror.) With me, there is usually some sort of element that saves the movie from utter failure. I regret to inform the cast and crew of Bloodrayne that that will not be the case here.\n\nThis movie leaves me to question the criteria and standards of movie producers and those that allow for a movie to be made. I'd like to know what kind of hallucinogen pushed whoever gave the go-ahead to this horrid movie. How am I to materialize a reality where those that put out \"Star Wars\" are classified under the same occupation title as those that put out \"Bloodrayne\"? Bloodrayne is most definitely the type of movie that wins bets. What I mean by that is this. \"I bet you that Bloodrayne is the worst movie ever.\" \"No way!\" \"Seriously...\" But seriously, there was no coherence and it could simply be described as an ADHD gamer's screenplay of his fantasy of the game.

        "review_detailed_main": "Both Bloodrayne and Bloodrayne 2 games are highly stylish and visually attractive, have interesting plot and thrilling action. Bloodrayne seemed to be destined to become a highly praised blockbuster. But Uwe Boll stood on its way and failed to execute any of its good features properly into a movie.\n\nFirst of all I should mention the main character of the franchise. In the video games Bloodrayne is a sexy dampire in really good physical shape. She is witty, impudent, sharp-tongued. I don't say Kristanna Loken is a bad actress, but she reveals none of these features in the movie. Why didn't she train to be in good shape in the movie? She was so sexy and slim in Terminator 3, but here all we see is a fat belly jutting out of the \"meant-to-be-sexy\" Bloodraye red and black costume and a flat shapeless bottom. Of course the way she fights being like this looks very clumsily and awkward. As for the nature of her character, she is shy and modest, nothing similar to the red-haired devil which produces sharp remarks while cutting enemies in halves. On the whole acting in the movie is good, way better than in the 2nd and the 3rd parts. Udo Kier fits the role of Kagan really good, he seems to be one of the few good features of the movie. Michelle Rodriguez is a hostile and mean strong woman, no wonder, almost all character she plays are the same. Bloodrayne's companions portrayed by Michael Madsen and Mattew Davis look natural and interesting enough for the viewers to empathize with them.\n\nThe plot is quite boring and the setting is very trite for a vampire movie (especially in comparison with the setting of the first Bloodrayne video-game). But at least the there is some plot here, it creates a complete story, in contrast with Bloodrayne 2 and 3. I really dislike the weapons used in the movie, all swords look as if they were borrowed from a poor puppet theatre. Kids' plastic swords look no less realistic sometimes.\n\nAnyway, today, when I have already seen Bloodrayne 2 and 3 I can say that the first part is not that awful as it seemed to be from the first sight, but as a movie about our beloved redhead vampire Bloodrayne it is an inexcusable fail."

The story is sometimes pushed upon the viewer rather than told. The story hasn't got too much in common with the game it's based on. While the cast is absolutely amazing, some of the acting is very wooden. Nevertheless, it's the best Boll movie yet (which ain't saying much) and compared to some of the recent movies coming out of Hollywood, this movie is above average (which admittedly also ain't saying much).\n\nThe important part is this: This movie is enjoyable and entertaining. The story is coherent and interesting. Some of the actors are great. The whole visual style of the movie is very well done. There are problems with this movie, but not more than in other recent Hollywood vampire movies - I actually prefer this to Blade 3, and it's not a whole lot worse than Underworld 2.\n\nIf you like Vampire movies, don't avoid this simply because it's from Boll. The movie ain't half bad, and I'm actually wondering whether most of the people commenting here have actually seen it, or whether they simply think that Boll bashing is fashionable."

The next part where she gains blood lust is a flashback of a poorly done fight scene while she whimpers and cries before a load of 80-s movie style vampires appear and attack a few travellers. She kills them in the most unspectacular way and spouts more crap lines.\n\nShortly after this, I lost my patience with this movie and stopped watching. I literally said \"No, no. Just...take it away. No. That's enough, I've had enough. No.\" The designs, fight choreography and script were shite beyond all hope of redemption. I personally don't hate Uwe Boll because he's only a director, and his main error is to make movies from video games, but what was he thinking?????!!!!!! All in all, leave this one alone - you'll never regret not seeing it.\n\nKristanna Loken wasn't great either, though I hear the sex scene would be worth watching if you want a quick fix - something I left the movie too early to watch.\n\nAt least it's better than still voices still lives."

I think some knew this was crap they were making so they didn't even bother to try, they just showed up for their scenes. The action isn't even good, it just tried to be what it is not. Rayne moves like she's wooden and I have seen movements that are more fluid in a Muppets movie.

So why always pick on uwe boll ? 1 many people react on him being a German, !!!!come on ,Americans\n\nare not always the superior ones !!! 2 German cinematic tradition has another kind of tension ( view Necromantic for ex.) 3 he tries too hard to give an American audience what they want\n\nand that is what they deserve but that doesn't make a good movie\n\nSo Bloodrayne is inferior to Underworld or Bam Stoker's Dracula FFC, but its easily outshines the likes of Cursed , Queen of the damned , Dracula 2000 etc.\n\nFor example the movie Romasanta is a European style horror movie and it works because American taste doesn't count at all !! Boll should rid himself of the question what do Americans want,and stick to European style works, but sells less."

It had some special effects, that were done properly. Is doing some elements that haven't been done for 25 years (raider's of the lost ark rip-off comment) really a rip-off. Good to see them again I say. What are you people expecting? It is a vampire killer movie! \"Oh it was as good as Cats!\" Please. Maybe there is a reason they took these roles... fun? I enjoyed this movie and people who are looking for a good medieval vampire slasher with a decent cast and decent budget... here you go. Don't expect Shindler's List or Ghandi because Kingsley has 10-20 lines in this. Kristanna Loken is gorgeous and does a decent, committed job. Enjoy. You won't have to listen to \"too cool for school\" Wesley Snipes give his moronic dialog for 2 hours. 6.8, 6.5, 5.7 BTW. Was Blade III 3.5 points better than this film, no.\n\nFor the people that have given this such a low rating that it has averaged out at 2.2, give me a break. This is based off a video game. It is a vampire slasher. It has sword-play and martial arts. Compare it to movies of the same genre and then be fair.\n\nReviews here are getting so picky (snobby) that it is hard to tell if a 5 rating is bad or not. Which it should be. I guess it is easier to pick something apart and sound like a \"true reviewer\" than to give a fair review. Too bad."

But not only was the actual production very poor, the casting was too, as well as the costume and makeup. Rayne is supposed to have ravishing looks, and Loken hardly does Rayne justice. But not all the blame can be on the casting, the makeup hardly improved her looks and her hair was dull rather than vibrant as it should be. I only give this movie a 2 out of 10 because it was nice to see a live actor on screen swinging those blades, although it didn't look like they let her practice with them much."

I am ashamed to say that I have seen this movie, as well as the other piece of crap he made 'Alone in the Dark'. All in all, that is approximately four hours of my life that I will never get back on those two stinkers. Uwe Boll isn't even in the same class of director as Ed Wood....he's worse. As for the actors, I have lost a lot of respect for both Ben Kingsley and Michelle Rodriguez, both are known for Academy Award nominated performances, both flopped in this piece of crap. Did they loose a bet, and have to pay-up by acting in this monstrosity? I will give Michelle credit at least for trying to salvage some of this endeavor of hers, she at least tried on the screen (which is more than I can say for Michael Madsen, Kristanna Loken, and Ben Kingsley). I would be reluctant to cast Kristanna in a play for an elementary school for fear of causing trauma to the children. The only thing of merit that she can claim in Bloodrayne, is her very perky breasts, and her ability to moan in a sex scene. And Michael Madsen is the equivalent of chewing on glass when he monotonously recites his lines (shoot me!). luckily I have short hair, otherwise I would have pulled it all out watching this gem from hell. We have idiots in the oval office, please don't keep idiots (Uwe Boll) in the production seat when it comes to our entertainment.....DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!"

The video game was pretty good, which is probably what makes the movie even worst.. if you played the game you'll be excited about the movie, but you'll probably turn the movie off half way if not earlier. I don't mean to be sarcastic.. I mean to say what my words literally mean \"This movie is really terrible!\" It must seriously take pathetic men to make such a movie. Movies like this one seriously insult your intelligence, and thus I am angry at the people who are responsible for this failure. Some time back such movies were made due to lack of experience.. but there is no such an excuse now-a-days. It really makes you wonder how can all the people involved in this product see how bad it's turning out to be, and still go on with it."

When Rayne would use her swords or whatever she had, the blood would just explode out of people, like Kill Bill but more extreme. It would be like geysers of blood shooting all over the place, quite silly for no apparent reason. The acting was awful, like the actors just got the script 10 minutes before coming on set, even for people like Michael Madasen. They just looked like they just woke up and didn't even care about the movie, just for the paycheck. I will give it this, it is better than House of the Dead and Alone in the Dark, but thats not saying much. I gave Dead and Dark a 1 each and I gave this a 3, mainly because of Loken, she was amazingly hot in this movie, from the sexy clothes to the sex scene that comes out of nowhere. She is the only plus about this movie. Shes not a good actress by any means but she did look great all through this movie."

Money? Trust me Ben, it's not worth it. Now I'll have to watch extra carefully the next time I grab one of his movies. As for the rest here's a piece of advice; take acting lessons.

But her flaws lies in her acting. One moment, she was feeble and weak and the next, she was Xena and then she become a damsel and then Buffy. How can Rayne looks tough and then weakens whenever someone empowers her?! She had her specialties and her skills but she truly doesn't know how to use her head. I'm disappointed, It gives bad name to one of my favourite game character.\n\nThere's also a few characters who had less use in the movie (and non-existence in the game) who only acts as a side characters who does nothing but complicating the storyline.\n\nThe script needs to rewrite since the character and the story lines are confusing and unrealistic.\n\nThe ONLY thing that was not flawed in the movie is the outfit and the sets. However, Rayne looks too out of the time in her outfit and her hair do. Its medieval right?\n\nTo director : Less out-of-the-story 'romance' and unrelated scenes and more gory and blood and character improvement. It seems the movie is trying to make do from the stunts than the story lines, its sadly disappointing. The budgets could be lessen in making the character grew than hiring stuntman. Its Rayne in the making, not Rayne ready in made.\n\nThis movie is preferably for extreme die-hard fans who are literally immune to the flaw of the acting.\n\nmovies : 3 by 10 actor/actress : 5 by 10 stunts : 7 by 10 story lines : 2 by 10 sounds : 6 by 10\n\nPersonally : I'm disappointed, terribly disappointed."

The dialog contains a delicate, artful balance of period and modern language, that takes the viewer back in time without making them feel that every resident of Romania was British.\n\nThe cinematography, lighting, sets, and costumes were all beautiful. Great attention was given to nearly every detail. Unlike films such as Doom and Wing Commander, I was drawn into the world created by the film. They all come together to create a dark, realistic environment, where you expect a vampire around every corner. The one shortcoming in this realm is that all of the bladed weapons in the film look to be stamped out of sheet metal rather than forged.\n\nThe acting, while not Oscar caliber, was convincing. Matthew Davis and Kristanna Loken did a particularly good job of bringing their characters to life. The biggest disappointment of the film was unfortunately that ,like the blades of the swords, the usually brilliant Michael Madsen's performance was completely flat.

I just wish he'd taken more time with this and taken it seriously! This guy only cares about the German tax breaks for pumping out movies, he cares nothing about art or entertainment.\n\nIn my opinion, something like this proves that his movies should be BANNED in American theaters and go direct to video until he make something other than the regular trash.\n\nYou took something great and ruined it, Herr Toilet, I just rejoice every day that Hideo didn't give you the rights to Metal Gear Solid.\n\nThank you Hideo!"

I think its even worst than Alone in the Dark, at least it has alien-creature things. The only best part in this movie is when Lokken show-off her gorgeous boobs&tits. I think she is suit to the Rayne character, but she didn't give a soul to the character, plus with a minor story which could strengthened the character. And what the **** Ben Kingsley doing in this movie. He is not cruel and cool enough to be Kagan. Perhaps he think it will be remarkable that he said \"so be it\" many times.

The actors give each other ample time to read their lines, standing perfectly still as if no one knew who had the next line. And when words do come out, they sound just as natural as when you're reading something for the first time, word for word.\n\nMuch of this may be attributed to the language, which by switching \"don't\" for \"do not\" and \"we have to\" for \"we must\", and giving some last minute instructions in British \"r\"s and \"a\"s, is meant to give it all a medieval sound. This may work for a stage drama, but not for a movie.\n\nKristanna Loken and Michelle Rodriguez made a few whole-hearted attempts at bringing some life and attitude to their characters, kudos to them! Unfortunately, the unnatural lines and the lack of atmosphere actually make them stand out for the worse. The more experienced actors, Ben Kingsley and Michael Madsen, seem to tackle this project with a more than understandable dejected ambivalence, which actually works to their characters' advantage. Meat Loaf and Billy Zane were lucky enough to have so short-lived characters that they could play them all out just to spice up the story a bit, without having to look back.\n\nNow I could go on with the rotten choreography, the minor flesh wounds that spurt blood like there's no tomorrow, the \"our invincible heroin fights an army, but gets knocked on the head and is rendered helpless\"- and \"our heroes were just killed, but return to save our heroin\"-clich\u00e9s, the hopeless camera angles and -effects, but I won't. And if you want to watch this one just to see Kristanna and/or Michelle; don't. What you see is surprisingly unimpressive, and by no means good enough to justify the disappointment of seeing them fail to save this hopeless movie.\n\nBottom line: The story is cool enough, and with a talented cast like this, it could have made for a great B movie. If it hadn't been for everything else."

        "review_detailed_main": "As someone who played and enjoyed Bloodrayne in the past, this was a disappointment and only proved that Uwe Boll is a lousy director with a special \"gift\" for creating shoddy video game adaptations.\n\nThe film takes place in the eighteenth century. A dhampir named Rayne (Kristanna Loken) is a kept as a circus freak before escaping to avenge her human mother who was raped by a Vampire named Kagan (Ben Kingsley). Along the way, she meets a trio of vampire hunters, (Michael Madsen, Michelle Rodriguez, Matt Davis) whom she convinces to help her take Kagan down.\n\nFirst of all, the story is almost completely different from the game. Instead of the 1930s, this story is in the 1700s. The plot muddy and progresses at a slow and weary pace that'll leave you confused as to what's happening, and the poorly written script and dialogue don't help. It doesn't feel like Bloodrayne at all.\n\nThe action scenes are too fast paced and blurry to enjoy or badly edited and unconvincing. Plus, the special effects, both practical and CGI, are painfully bad. Even the weapons, including Rayne's blades, looked like plastic props you'd buy at a costume shop, looking as ridiculously fake as the wigs worn by several characters. Worse still was the aesthetic which didn't match the game at all. The costumes aren't very impressive; even Rayne's outfit seemed mediocre.\n\nThe acting was the worst part of all, despite consisting of a good ensemble, somehow including Ben Kingsley. The cast completely phone in their performances. Loken is the only one who makes any kind of half-decent effort, but her acting still lacks the witty and sarcastic spirit that Raynes voice actress, Laura Bailley, delivered in the games. Bailey herself even said she hated this film.\n\nThe rest of the actors were largely apathetic and lazy in their roles. Ben Kingsley has a blank or uncomfortable expression as he spends most of his screentime sitting on a throne, probably thinking \"What the hell am I doing here?\". Michael Madsen is clearly drunk in all of his scenes. Michelle Rodriguez's fake British accent fools nobody. Meatloaf's wig looked fake. It's like they didn't care at all and just wanted to get paid and go home.\n\nSadly, this is only the first of three horrible Bloodryane flicks directed by Uwe Boll in his six-year campaign to eviscerate the franchise, which undoubtedly pissed off a few fans of the games."

I hope like crazy that someone else with the power to redo this film sees how terrible it was done and recreates it, but on a level that's worth paying money for. This is one of those movies that makes one hesitant to see a video game to the big screen conversion for fear of how it's going to destroy something great. Shudder."

I heard a bit about the movie during filming and when I saw it I figured it might be good. I was wrong. This movie had effects that were so low budget that there is not a comparable movie that has been made in several decades (I'm sure someone knows of a recent movie, but I don't). Once you combine that with a story that just drags on and on (like this review?) it's just not pleasant to watch. I have tried to watch it a second time to see if maybe I was just expecting more, but couldn't even make it half way before I was finding another DVD to watch (I think I made it 15-20 minutes). In my defense I've only bought one other movie without seeing it (equlibrium) which was fairly good, and I figured \"it has that chick from T3, cool\". Well I highly recommend running and screaming from this movie"

        "review_detailed_main": "This film will not win any Academy awards, or any Golden Globes, but it will be a diversion for about ninety-nine minutes. It's not the cream of the crop, but it still could become a guilty pleasure. You must leave all expectations for a vampire movie at the door, because it does not follow standard convention. It is based on a video game for starters, that means that anything goes. This is about Rayne and her quest for vengeance against her father, a head vampire, played very minimalistic by Ben Kingsley. There is a fair amount of blood and gore, especially in the unrated edition. There is some stilted dialog and some wooden acting. However, most of it comes from Michelle Rodriguez. And, Will Sanderson, is actually good as a lead henchman for Kingsley. It's not the most polished film, or best acted, but it definitely ISN'T the worst film of all time, as some hacks would lead you to believe. Most people want to bash Uwe Boll for his work, but I think he rather stays true to his vision. And besides, he funds his own films, so you can't beat him down for that. Still, there are a lot of people that write harsh reviews, some without even spelling actors names right. Those \"reviewers\" should realize they can spew all the unintelligent trash they want, but when it comes down to doing nothing or watching Bloodrayne, they'll have it in their DVD player faster than they can spell Kristanna Loken. So, if you like vampires, blood & gore & a sexy Kristanna Loken, you should check out Bloodrayne. It is by far Uwe Boll's best attempt to date, I know that's not saying much, but just give it a chance."

I wish Billy Zane had had more screen time , he was funny and sarcastic with what he got, Kingsley was chewing up the scenery, and Matthew Davis was good.\n\nStill we hardly watch these type of movies for the acting and only really notice it if it is real bad...it was not.\n\nThe action was very bloody (a good thing), the story fast paced and where it was coherent, very interesting if basic.The scenery and sets were very beautiful and drew you into the movie. The ending was my biggest complaint, it made no sense to me at all. If it had ended when she sat in the chair, that would have been abrupt, but OK, the tacked on 5 min review of the gore was cool but did not add or complete the story (see the movie, you will see what i am talking about.\n\nAll in all I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a above average gore/action/vamp movie."

Most comments on Bloodrayne here are so negative that it becomes ridiculous. How can you complain about the unrealistic settings when the movie what shot in Transylvania. It does NOT get any more realistic than that. Other complained about the bad acting: \"you could not sense the persons deep feelings and motivations\" and things like that... This is just plain stupid! BloodRayne is not a drama. It's a mix between a horror, action and fantasy-movie, based on a video game. Does anyone really go to the movies, or buy such a DVD to study the feelings of the heroes?? No, you see this kind of movies to get 95 minutes of fun and entertainment. And that's what you get here. Not more and certainly not less. OK, Bloodrayne has some small weaknesses. The Blades do not always look that sharp, the choreographies of the fights were not all top level (some were!), and some other details did not entirely satisfy me. But the cast was great, the photography impressive and the visual effect were so good that you mostly didn't even realize that it wasn't real. So if somebody writes that it's one of the worst movies (s)he has seen so far, that person must not have seen many movies. Has this person even seen BloodRayne?? I enjoyed this movie and give it 8/10!"

        "review_detailed_main": "BloodRayne does not deserve appraisal, but I do have to congratulate Uwe Boll on making a film where the plot actually makes a little bit of sense. The movie suffers from Boll's typical over-emphasis on action and sex rather than comprehensive transition, but at least the characterization was done fairly well.\n\nThe film is well worth the peak for vampire-enthusiasts, but most people will not find much else redeemable about the film. A few other points that I feel are worth mentioning...\n\nThe use of English accents was a nice touch as well as the occasionally sarcastic, anachronistic dialogue. Unfortunately the film still suffers from occasional nonsensical utterings that rather disrupt the flow of the film. Additionally Ben Kingsley's speaking-parts were incredible stiff, even if he managed to bust a few giggles out of me with his \"ungrateful bitch\" line.\n\nThough gracious titty-shots were abound I feel that the single most ridiculous use of them occurs during the ridiculous sex-scene between Sebastian and Rayne. Additionally Boll should get by now that adding gore doesn't make an action-scene credible.\n\nAlso, while I have not played the actual game I have to say that the plot did bring to mind Simon's Quest, though I hope the upcoming Castlevania-film will have more enthusiasm and talent behind it.\n\nIn the long-run it's actually difficult to say anything concrete about the film. Parts of it are clumsy, parts of it are okay. Dialogue and action scenes are stiff and awkward at times yet convincing at others. The film contains some unintentional hilarity, but the parts that were intended to be funny also 'are' funny. The ending is not memorable, but it's not unsatisfying.\n\nThe film is neither good or bad. It really depends on one's attitude towards vampires."

The actors had no chemistry, there acting was far below mediocre and the writing was garbage. I don't understand how Dr. Uwe Boll thinks he makes quality movies.

(To every person who blithely claims this is the worst film ever I recommend Raptor Island on the Sci-fi network as a primer on how bad genre films can actual be or perhaps a made for PAX disaster film such as the obviously titled Killer Flood: The Day the Dam Broke.) Yes Uwe's House of the Dead was a particularity stupid film. I hated it too. But Uwe knows how to point his camera in the general direction of the action and keep the action at a pace that holds ones interest.\n\nBloodRayne is a surprisingly enjoyable genre romp. Yes all the individual criticisms at the film from the bizarre choices in hair pieces and costumes to the silly dialogue are true. But c'mon it's a video game/vampire movie. Really how high are ones expectations going in? For a video game movie it isn't half bad. (Its tons better than say Doom, not as tightly put together as say Resident Evil) Uwe brings a refreshing European sensibility to sex and violence in the movie (In other words plenty of gratuitous nudity and violence). He also makes good use of the Romanian landscape bringing an almost Peter Jackson feel to the proceedings.\n\nAlso in campy side of things it's always fun watching Hollywood professionals ruin careers for the sake of a paycheck. (The way Madsen looks and acts in this movie I wouldn't hire him to do my lawn and Kingsley acts as if he is auditioning for the Mr. Burns role in an upcoming live action Simpson's movie) So Uwe Boll isn't the next Ed Wood more a talentless Paul Verhoeven. Hey at least his films are getting better and BloodRayne is a surprising fun film for those with a less discriminating taste."

If you're a fan of bloody-action movies, and in particular B grade action movies, then you should enjoy Bloodrayne for its' other qualities. The action sequences are well choreographed and pulled-off by the actors and stunt doubles. There is a ton of blood, and I mean literally \"a ton\". If you like cheesy action shots where someones head gets crushed with blood splattering everywhere, and brain pieces flying about, then you MUST watch this movie. To top it all off, there is a respectable amount of nudity. Some people have called it soft-porn, but while one scene shows some rather believable sex, I found all of the nudity to be in good taste, and it fit the film rather well. Simply put: if you have a single Troma movie in your collection, pick up Bloodrayne(Unrated version)."

Uwe boll has made some tripe ( see Alone in the dark for proof ) but this is definitely a lot better than that abortion, i just hope his next game to film project can build on this good movie and not revert to the sub standard levels of house of the dead. the cast of the film is superb ranging from the superb sir Ben Kingsle to the stunning Kristanna Loken and the ever dependable Micheal madsen, the music gives it a medieval and Gothic feel and the setting is quite fantastic, so all said and done a good film and you will not regret watching it.\n\np.s ignore the '' we hate uwe boll bandwagon jumpers'' who slag this film off, its very good and I'm glad i own it."

Much better than its god awful sequel House of The Dead 2: Dead Aim. Which in my opinion is a piece of $@#% on the side of the road! Alone in the Dark wasn't that bad either. Sure some parts were slow, but it was good action/horror movie. Bloodrayne I loved, it has to be my favorite of the three. I wanted to see it so bad when it came out in theaters last January, but it didn't last long here at all and I missed it. So I bought the DVD and enjoyed every minute of it. I thought it had a lot of action, some great CGI too. I don't know why people say it sucks. Bloodrayne was like a Medieval Blade movie except with a girl. Some of the coolest looking death scenes too. The lady at Blockbuster kept telling me not to buy the movie, but I didn't listen to her. I could care less what she thought; she couldn't even say the name of the movie right. That right there tells you she knew nothing about the movie and probably never even saw it! Go ahead bash me; I thought it was good action/horror movie. I waited months for the DVD, and I was not one bit disappointed. I wish I could have seen this in theaters, it would have been even better on the big screen. If you're a fan of the Bloodrayne video games, definitely check out the movie. It's great and full of blood! I for one liked the movie. I'm probably one of the few people in the world that did too. Looking forward to seeing Uwe Boll's next films."

But here's what I thought about the movie (and I am not commenting about Uwe Boll because I don't really know anything about him. I am just the average moviegoer ...\n\n1. The cinematography is actually quite good. The panoramas, the setting shots, and some of the set shots are actually raise your expectations of the movie.\n\n2. The dialogue is quite bad. It's not the worst I have ever witnessed, but some of the characters are horrible. Both the script and the actual dialogue (particularly Vladmir) is stilted, fake, and poor. Kristanna Loken's (Rayne's) dialogue is sub-par, but not the worst. Katarin's dialogue is actually well done and her acting is probably among the best in the movie. Kagan (Ben Kingsley) does a pretty good job of his role - it's a little forced, but decent.\n\n3. The violence (aka blood-sprays) STRONGLY detract from this movie. It would have been so easy to take out the super-fake blood spraying and make the movie much more watchable. Some of the wanton (and unexplainable) violence/killing could have been avoided and actually benefited the movie.\n\n4. The Choreography was actually decent in most cases. Some of it sucked (particularly when Rayne is trying to look powerful and fails miserably).\n\n5. I am a typical guy, and Kristanna Loken looked SUPER hot in this movie. Her first outfit ... (drool) ... but her later \"better\" outfit was actually worse and less believable. For skin-freaks out there, there is a lovely few moments of delicious Kristanna-breast-baring and a scene with Meatloaf and a naked harem of relatively tasty treats (among the thoroughly dessicated bodies).\n\n6. The plot is pretty good. It tries to maintain the storyline of the game (which I played and enjoyed), but it has some grievious flaws. The game is centered around modern time whereas the movie is set some time in medieval Europe. Not so good. But if you overlook this (and a few other points), the story is fairly engaging, particularly if you compare it to other B flicks.\n\nOverall, I did enjoy this movie. But only going into it expecting (and willing to overlook) some of it's obvious detractors. So if you want to see it, try to see past the crappy blood-spraying and try to enjoy the movie. It is NOT Underworld on any level.\n\n8/10 for a B movie; 2/10 for an A movie."
