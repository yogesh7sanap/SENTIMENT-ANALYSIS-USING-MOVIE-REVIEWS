Now I really liked the animation, the Easter Bunnys warehouse where they make candy for Easter is the most awesome thing since Willy Wonkas Chocolate Factory. Not to mention Hugh Laurie, Russell Brand, and Hank Azaria voice there characters perfectly, and provide much of the films humor.\n\nNow the live action was not as funny, at times James Marsden slips by with a funny line. but other than that it's all pretty stale. Even David Hasselhoff making fun of himself, hasn't he done enough of that already. I know what they are trying to do, a Santa Clause, but with Easter. And they did alright, but they could have done a little better."

        "review_detailed_main": "I know there's people that say Minions is worse, but I thought that film was just okay. In fact, at least I take that over this. Hop is by far, the weakest movie from Illumination. Yeah, it has some good ideas its going for, some good animation that brings Easter to life and actors that have a decent amount of effort. But considering this is from the creators that brought Alvin And The Chipmunks, the story is lazily predictable. The tone tries to be modern for the young crowd making it outdated. The humor is mostly weak. The characters feel they aren't something for an Easter movie. And the ending was highly childish. The one thing I can recommend this is for the children for Easter time. As for anyone else, I think it's best to stick with the Sonic The Hedgehog movie from 2020. It may have the same plot line as this, but at least a good version. The idea sounded great of something like one of those Christmas specials, but the movie itself is just easily mediocre. Maybe one day we'll get a good Easter movie, but this is not really it. Happy Easter."

        "review_title": "\"Hop\" is so sweet it will give you a cavity.",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Hop\" is another movie in a long line of big budget Easter Bunny films, just like...um... well ... er ... I guess there aren't many Easter movies that stick out in my mind. The team at Illumination Entertainment (who also brought you \"Despicable Me\") tried something new and approached a holiday that hasn't earned much attention from the film industry. Maybe they will set a standard for Easter films and this could be the beginning of Easter films. Or the end.\n\nThe movie starts off strong; we are introduced to the hero of the film E.B. (voiced by Russell Brand) (I can only assume E.B. stands for Easter Bunny) who is touring the candy factory with his dad on Easter Island (where else would an Easter Bunny live?). His father (voiced by Hugh Laurie) really wants E.B. to be the next Easter Bunny. Unlike Santa Claus, where there is only one of him that lives for a really long time; there is a long line of Easter Bunnies that have been keeping this Easter tradition alive for 4,000 years (for the Christians, do the math, does something seem fishy? For the Catholics, that fishy pun was intended for you in this Lenten season.) At the same time, we see Fred O'Hare (get it? O'Hare. I'm sure there's a joke in there somewhere) as a small child who catches a glimpse of E.B.'s dad delivering Easter eggs. Fred even sees the Easter sleigh (A sleigh? Yes, I must have missed that one as a kid. It's an Easter sleigh towed by hundreds of tiny yellow chicks.).\n\nFast forward 20 years, Fred (played by James Marsden) is now a grown man living at home with his parents with no job or even a real future. And, E.B. is now a teenager (for any of the viewers, do the math\u0085wait, don't do the math and just go with this one) who wants to drum in a band instead of inheriting the title of Easter Bunny. He runs away to Hollywood to follow his dreams. There Fred literally runs into E.B. with his car. I didn't realize how funny it can be to see a CGI bunny get hit by a car.\n\nFred and E.B. don't hit it off right away; Fred is pretty sure he is imagining the whole thing. E.B. annoys Fred with his antics and then Fred tries dumping E.B. in the wilderness. E.B. finally proves to Fred that he is the Easter Bunny by pooping out jelly beans. It's fun for the kids, I guess. Fred then remembers the time he saw the Easter Bunny which makes him ignore the fact that he despised this rabbit 10 minutes earlier. Here, as in most kiddie films, the two characters that had their differences and are now best of friends, must work together to fight a common enemy and therefore save Easter.\n\nShould you see this movie? Nope. The CGI and detail put into it was great but they didn't put half as much effort into the story. Sure it was cute and sure it had a few funny moments, but it's just not worth it to see this movie. The kids have probably seen the trailer and want to see the bunny that poops candy. If they are between ages 4 and 9 maybe put the DVD in their Easter basket next year but don't waste 90 minutes for a 15-second joke."

The visuals with CGI bunnies and the Easter Island Wonka factory is fun but it all continually falls short of amounting to anything. Clever casting with appealing James Marsden helps but his family scenes are uniformly weak, and play like bad 60s TV scenes we all groaned about in the original Bewitched. Overall HOP is a huge disappointment made irritating by boring Brand. A real missed opportunity, made infuriating by the sitcom style and the go nowhere script and hopeless character development. All that technical expertise and THIS is all they do with it. That is lazy and cynical film making as if bundling shiny ribbon together is all that is needed. I went with a 4 year old and she (like others in the cinema) just became bored."

        "review_detailed_main": "In the 2011 film Hop, the Easter Bunny is basically Santa Claus and its main character, EB, is just like Alvin (of Alvin and the Chipmunks). In fact, this movie is very similar to Alvin's movie. Alvin and Hop both feature live-action stars co-starring alongside computer-animated main characters. Both of these animated, central \"cute\" animals want/dream of becoming recording/rock star musicians (Alvin sings ... EB plays the drums). James Marsden (Enchanted, X-Men, 27 Dresses) steps into the role of Dave as the character Fred O'Hare (uh, get it ... hare!?!). And that is about it.\n\nAs for plot: EB has fled Easter Island (yes, THAT Easter Island; and yes, \"lame\"!) a couple of weeks before he is supposed to take on the title of THE Easter Bunny. He flees to Hollywood (\"where all dreams come true\") and meets up with the bumbling Marsden who doesn't know what he wants to do in life. Hint ... hint ... for future plot points!\n\nEB(voiced by Russell Brand - Get Him to the Greek, Arthur, Despicable Me) is chased by a fairly tough bunch of Pink Berets who's mission is to bring him back to the island. While in LA, EB gets to meet and audition for David Hasselhoff (uh, talk about random) and his televised talent competition. I mean really!\n\nThe movie is short (luckily!) BUT rambling and devoid of anything great or meaningful. The character is cute BUT annoying and irritating and kind of selfish ... which doesn't make him a character I wanted to root for (and that the role/job of the Easter Bunny that EB is fleeing from doesn't ever come across as something dreadfully dream-killing). His plight is rather \"ho-hum, poor you\" (!) as he would only have to work-work ONE day a year (which leaves plenty of time to still rock a set of drums) as it is revealed that most of his work would be done by a large population of yellow chicks -- think Santa's elves and (boo!!!) the rip-offed Minions of Despicable Me!\n\nIt is kind of odd that such a bright and pastel-colored film with such cute animated characters (one even poops jellybeans!) would leave one with such a feeling of apathy. And ... so ... uhm ... ? But this is exactly how Hop made me feel.\n\nI enjoyed the talking pig film Babe (LOVED it); but Hop lacks that genuine human feeling of OTHER talking animal movies ... it feels manufactured and painted like a brightly-colored (yet HOLLOW) Easter egg."

May be best to wait for this one to come out on DVD and keep it in mind for an Easter basket gift for next year. There are a shortage of good, original movie plots out there, short on story line and imagination.

        "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: Hop",
        "review_detailed_main": "Just as how Santa Claus stories work through their way through the Christmas period, Hop brings forward the Easter season some three weeks early with a kids film that combines the best of live action and animation in yet another talking animal story, which is something quite expected when you combine filmmakers who had worked on Alvin and the Chipmunks, and the producers of Despicable Me, who probably would have floated the idea that cute yellow things make for comedic villains since they're going against type.\n\nHop is a tale about sons being unable to live up to the ideals of their fathers, being told what is expected, being seen as soft and unable to exert any say in what they really want to do in life. When we first see EB (or short for Easter Bunny, voiced by Russell Brand), \"plush toy\" comes to mind for its incredibly cute design when the wide eyed bunny tours and allows the audience to see first hand what would be the equivalent of Santa's operations that the Easter Bunny adopts, with multitudes of chocolate and candy making machines all outsourced not to elves, but to chicks to operate and churn them out, before making deliveries in one single day to all the kids.\n\nBut as EB grows up, his propensity to take on the family business, or rather his calling in life, takes a hit and wanes because he aspires to dabble in music and play drums. Rather than take over from his father, he runs away to Hollywood to seek out his fortunes and thereby putting Easter potentially on hold, and bumps into Fred O'Hare (James Marsden), who is also kicked out of his family home because his father and family members find it a tad ridiculous that he mucks around home for the last one year doing nothing. So it's a chance meeting of two similar sons set to prove themselves in a whole new world, and bring about the usual kids theme of friendship, perseverance, and plenty of juvenile comedy. Look out for David Hasselhoff playing himself, and the requisite cute bunnies collectively known as the Pink Berets who would probably steal the show.\n\nI have to admit though that some of the jokes do work, since it's quite a wide spectrum from the usual toilet humour - EB poops delicious, multi-flavoured candy! - to a hilarious get up of the song I Love Candy with the duo continuing a ruse from earlier involving EB pretending to be a plush toy. This aspect of the film compensates for the lack of sophistication of the plot which for some weird reason has Fred not being satisfied with having validated that he's not crazy with his young time witnessing of the Easter Bunny going about his one day routine, but desiring to instead become a bunny himself.\n\nThat brought about what I thought was the most direct reference back to Despicable Me with the mindless bantering amongst the minions of the Easter Bunny's factory, where second in command Carlos (Hank Azaria), in the absence of EB and his dad getting old, secretly coverts a plot to usurp the festivity and run the entire show himself. While the minions have different designs and varying degrees of intelligence, the chicks here adopt a uniform look, and as expected there's always a smart alecky character to become cannon fodder for laughs.\n\nBesides priming itself for a respectable box office result when the Easter holiday rolls along, what this film would probably successfully do is to ramp up demand for rabbits and chicks amongst its targeted demographic, so parents, do spare a thought and taper those short term wants. Strictly for the kids. Do stay tuned until after the end credits for a scene to witness James Marsden's Mandarin diction."

Back to the Hispanic chick, he tries to make it clear to the daddy bunny that he is the only one that wants the job. And when it doesn't work, he takes over by force and feels deserved, because he deserves it more than the stubborn daddy bunny and his S#!% head son. I was cheering when EB was being beaten up by the Hispanic chick, because who wouldn't want him to have a bad death?

        "review_detailed_main": "The Easter Bunny is to Easter what Santa Claus is to Christmas. Legend has it that both the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus go around people's houses at night before their respective days bringing gifts- though in the case of the Easter Bunny, these tend to be more specific to coloured eggs, candy and chocolates. Despite their similarities, Hollywood seems to favour Santa Claus over the Easter Bunny, going by the number of Yuletide-themed films around the plump, jolly, white-bearded man in a red suit and the dearth of films about the latter.\n\nCinco Paul and Ken Daurio however attempt to change that with their part-live action, part-animated romp \"Hop\", a through and through family film centred around the Easter Bunny. Also the writers of last summer's surprising hit for Chris Meledandri's Illumination Entertainment's \"Despicable Me\", Paul and Daurio display much less of their ingenuity this time round. Indeed, their adaptation of the Easter Bunny legend borrows too heavily from Yuletide films like \"Elf\", \"Fred Claus\" and in particular \"The Santa Clause\" that it almost feels that they have merely switched elves for chicks, reindeers also for chicks and Santa for the Easter Bunny.\n\nThe references are apparent right from the start, when we are first introduced to the Easter factory where all the candy and chocolates for the kids are prepared. Production designer Richard Holland's vision of this is no more than \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" crossed with Santa's workshop in any of the films mentioned above, and despite the riot of colours, there's little wildly inventive that will make you go 'wow'. Same goes for the Easter Bunny's mode of transportation, which is really an egg-shaped sleigh pulled by hundreds of tiny chicks; or the source of its magical powers, derived from the Egg of Destiny or the equivalent of a Santa suit.\n\nPaul and Daurio's reliance on these Yuletide film tropes extends as well to the plot of the movie, which essentially is the story of the heir- apparent to the Easter Bunny throne, E. B. (voiced by Russell Brand, who also makes a live-action cameo later on) absconding his responsibilities to pursue his dreams of musical superstardom much to the chagrin of his father (Hugh Laurie). You can probably guess the narrative pretty much from here on end- just add in another out-of-work slacker, Fred (James Marsden), who is in the same real-life situation as E.B. with his father (Gary Cole).\n\nBesides sorting out their own father-son issues, E.B. and Fred will also spend time bickering with each other, before bonding through a fictional David Hasselhoff (playing himself) reality show \"Hoff Knows Talent\" (an all-too obvious riff on \"America's Got Talent\") and a sing-along at a school play where both take turns singing 'I Want Candy'. There's also a subplot which sees E.B's father's number two, a duplicitous Spanish chick Carlos (voiced by Hank Azaria), insinuating that he be crowned the next Easter Bunny in E.B's absence- but this is played for little more than to allow for an frenetic action-packed finale at the end.\n\nThough originality isn't one of its strong suits, director Tim Hill's (Alvin and the Chipmunks) film does take- pardon the pun- more than a few hops in the right direction. Most prominently, Hill's experience with such part-animation, part-live action fare is amply demonstrated in the seamless blend of E.B. and the rest of the computer-generated animals with their human counterparts- special mention goes to E.B, whose features and expressions are beautifully and vividly animated. Impressive too is Illumination Entertainment's ability to create 'oh-so- adorable' sidekick characters, the chicks including Carlos and the over- enthusiastic prone-to-dancing Phil reminiscent of the little yellow minions from \"Despicable Me\" and equally irresistible.\n\nHill has also assembled a lively voice cast led by the vivacious Russell Brand. Though there is none of the raunchiness usually associated with him (think \"Get Him to the Greek\"), Brand's distinctive laid-back charm is still intact and fits his character perfectly. Just as outstanding is Hank Azaria's voicing of both Carlos and Phil. Though the two characters couldn't be more different in nature, Azaria finds a unique voice for each, and is especially good at delivering Carlos' punchlines with aplomb- who can forget Carlos' line 'It's called a coup d'\u00e9tat which is a French for coup d'\u00e9tat!'\n\nAnd thanks to Brand and Azaria's voice talents, as well as the excellent blend of live-action and animation, \"Hop\" still proves to be more than agreeable family entertainment- even if laugh-out-loud moments are fewer and further-in-between than one would expect. Not to mention of course that the familiarity with Yuletide films of Santa Claus is unmistakable, which also makes \"Hop\" just as undemanding, if not unexceptional, fare as most of these movies. Still, it's colourful, it's buoyant, and it's cute, so that's definitely enough to keep the kids entertained."

However, E.B. has a different idea about what his future has in store. To avoid his destiny, E.B. leaves Easter Island two weeks before his coronation on Easter day through a rabbit hole to Hollywood. After a misunderstanding at the Playboy Mansion, E.B. meets disappointment Fred O'Hare (catchy name) who has failed to live up to his father's (Gary Cole, \"Talladega Night\") expectations. However, Fred's life is turned around after he meets E.B., allowing him to realize his life long dream of becoming the Easter Bunny. However, before this realization can be made a reality, Fred and E.B. must stop the evil plot of the head chick at the factory, Carlos (Hank Azaria, \"Love and Other Drugs\") that would change Easter forever.\n\nThe only thing that \"Hop\" is successful at is targeting children. It provides this audience exactly what they would want out of a family-safe Easter film. Everything about the film is harmless and clich\u00e9 within its kid friendly genre, ultimately pleasing parents, who do not have to worry about what their kids see. However, from a critical standpoint the only character that is somewhat worth following is E.B. Lets face it, you do not see many British bunnies that sound like Russel Brand every day.\n\nThe truth is that even though \"Hop\" may be the best film in theaters for kids to see, it has no excuse to totally disregard originality. Even though not many films about Easter are ever seen in theaters, \"Hop\" seems like just another Christmas film shot during the spring season. Every plot line and twist can be taken lightly because believe it or not it has all been done before. The jumbling of so many clich\u00e9 plot lines makes the story random and by the end none of the film was fully developed. Also, the acting in the film is horridly hokey except for various Russel Brand moments. Even so, Brand was a very awkward choice for his role because he is the only bunny with a British accent. The clumsiness of the casting does not stop there with the evil chick Carlos (Hank Azaria, \"Love and Other Drugs\") being the only Hispanic chick in the movie.\n\nThe story is very plain mixing \"The Santa Clause\" and \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" with an Easter shell. This makes \"Hop\" nothing more than a kid-pleasing flick that will make you wonder if Christmas came early this year."

        "review_detailed_main": "E.B.(voiced by Russell Brand) lives on Easter Island, haha, beneath one of the giant stone heads. His father (Hugh Laurie), you see, is THE Easter Bunny and has been training EB to take over the job when its time. That day is very near, making EB fret, for he is into drumming and longs to be a rock star. On the island, the candy-and-egg factory is run quite well by Carlos the Chicken (Hank Azaria). In fact, Carlos thinks that a rooster can BE the next Big Bunny, it shouldn't be a species thing. As the holiday approaches, EB bolts off the island, via a secret tunnel, to Hollywood. At that moment, Fred (James Marsden) is driving away quickly from his digs at his parents house. Mom (Elizabeth Perkins) and Dad (Gary Cole) have just held an \"intervention\" to explain that Fred must find another job and get his own place. SOON. Naturally, Fred's car bumps into EB but the bunny is okay. In fact, since Fred is going to house sit at a huge mansion in Beverly Hills, thanks to his well-connected sister, EB thinks it is the start of a beautiful friendship between slacker and rabbit. Although the bunny does stir up trouble, Fred manages to get him an audition with the Hoff (David Hasselhoff, as himself) and EB wins over the talent critic and scores a big gig. Meanwhile, Fred loses out on another job opportunity and tries to convince the rabbit that maybe HE, Freddie, could take over the Easter Bunny position. Back on Easter Island, Dad Rabbit is frantic to find his son while Carlos launches a stealth mission to take over the entire operation. How will things resolve? What a beautifully animated movie this is, colorful and so superb at combining computer generated images with live action. See it on the biggest screen you can find, even if it means seeking out the rich relatives' home theater and begging for access. Also, the cast is nice, although Marsden, despite being a charming performer, may be too old for the part of Fred, as other critics have notices. Azaria, Laurie and especially Brand add much to the film with their voices roles and the other actors are nice, too. The sets are likewise very beautiful, especially the elegant Beverly Hills Mansion where the two unlikely housesitters go. Therefore, its near-miss as a must-see belongs to the uneven script and the rather tame and slower direction. There are clever lines and situations to be found but, alas, there's also too much banality. Nevertheless, I do urge families to hop the hop and get a showing of Hop going. It is certainly will be quite a nice view for the crew."

        "review_detailed_main": "I feel bad rating this movie so low, because I suspect there was a lot of good intent. There was certainly good casting; the most amusing aspect of this movie is the sly cameo stunt-casting. Hugh Hefner does a voice cameo that's pretty funny, for instance.\n\nAnd then there's Hugh Laurie as EB's dad. While it may seem at odds with his nearly-amoral Dr. House, once upon a time Laurie provided the voice for Peter Rabbit in the animated Beatrix Potter stories. He reprises this voice here. It almost qualifies as an in-joke; I was certainly amused by it, but it didn't really do anything to advance the story.\n\nI also feel bad for the performers in general. They're good, and they're stuck in the most cynically-written movie I've seen in a long time. There's NOTHING original here. At all. James Marsden is likable enough, as is the near-ubiquitous Russell Brand's EB. The scenes are all pretty much lifted from old Disney movies and Christmas specials (even an incomprehensible nod to \"Back to the Future\"). We don't really learn a lot about the bunnies and their world, and we don't get anything but the sketchiest motivation for anyone. And while David Hasselhoff's cameo in the Spongebob movie was clever and self-deprecating, here it was just kind of sad.\n\nYes, I realize the response to this will be \"aw, give them a break... it's cute...\" The trouble is, there have been tons of genuinely GOOD family movies made in the past several years. Back in the bad old 80s this tired script might have been forgivable. Universal Pictures is making a lot of mileage out of \"Hop\" coming from Illumination Studios, the same people who did \"Despicable Me\", because THAT movie was genuinely GOOD. I'll grant that technically, \"Hop\" is pretty good. But all the technical brilliance in the world won't make up for a poor story.\n\nIn all fairness, I'll admit that my 7 year old enjoyed it. My 10 year old, though rates it at about a 3 on the 1-10 scale, so the bar's pretty low. Wait for video."

It tries to do for Easter what the Santa Clause movies did for Christmas, but misses the mark by light years. The main problem being that the iconography, the sights and sounds that characterise Christmas, just aren't there with Easter - and this leads to pretty much everything being forced, or coming across as a lame attempt to emulate the more expansive holiday period. None of the characters (inc EB) are very pleasant and attempt to have his story match that of the male lead is clumsy and obvious. On top of that, nothing interesting actually happens - characters don't develop, there is no sense of challenge or danger at any point and even the one possible exciting element (the Pink Beret's) are given nothing to do. OK, so both my kids said they enjoyed it, but I think I can put that down to the popcorn and chocolate they had. If they really like a movie it sticks with them, we'd barely got in the car before they'd moved onto another subject. 'Hop' is a lame rip off of a more successful movie franchise, don't be fooled by the fact that it's from a major animation studio. It is, quite simply, boring and unengaging for both kids and adults alike."

The animation is splendid and the jokes throughout the film are jokes that any kid would enjoy. Even as an adult I was laughing throughout the entire movie. I mean would the creators of the hit \"Despicable Me\" really lead you wrong? My answer is no. This movie will leave you hopping out of the theater with nothing but a look of satisfaction.

So when we saw the trailer for this we all made the decision that upon its release we would go and check it out. Well did that today and we all, even myself (the most criticising of these films) enjoyed it immensely. Now i can definitely make fun of the fact that James Marsden is doing a film of this type however i have to say i love him in these kid flicks as he does such a believable job in them. This places the easter bunny and his apprentice his very own son on their home turf of Easter Island of course and the senior Easter Bunny who is voiced by TV's Dr. House's Hugh Laurie is trying with everything he has got to persuade E. B. to get seriously ready to take over the family business. E.B. voiced by Russell Brand would rather make a living being a professional rock drummer then deliver the eggs all over the world making the children ever so happy. After a row between the two of them E.B. flees Easter Island in a bid to follow his drumming dreams to Hollywood California. There he meets up with a unemployed slacker who still lives at home Fred O'Hare ( James Marsden) who has his own dreams of being something that he will never be. Eb wreaks havoc in Fred's life till they ultimately come to the determination what both of their destinies will be. A great family film to ring in the upcoming Easter weekend!"

One of them being the use of toilet humor (mainly the scene where E.B. poops jellybeans to prove he is the son of the Easter Bunny, which is gross, even for a fictional animal like E.B.). However, the actors do a good job, some of the scenes are interesting (like Fred crashing a children's pageant to protect E.B), and the movie delivers a good message about being who you want to be.

The Easter Island scenes were fantastic and very well executed. They did an excellent job of creating an Easter Universe and workshop reminiscent of the South Pole and Santa's elves, but with bunnies instead of elves. The movie also boasts a great soundtrack. However, the storyline was just okay, fairly straightforward and predictable.

It has an incredible cast and that's probably why I'm disappointed it wasn't better.\n\nHowever, it's still a tradition and it still has a charm to it so it will still be a tradition of mine for the foreseeable future, but will always be laughed at rather than laughed with."

        "review_detailed_main": "HOP\n\nI had seen a couple of trailers about this movie... but in all of the ones I had seen it was just a bunny playing drums... I was not expecting this to be a mixture of live action and animation.\n\nThe movie is about the Easter Bunnys son and a guy who is too lazy to even get a job. E.B. is the Easter Bunnys son. He is next in line to take over when his Dad retires, but he doesn't want to be the Easter Bunny... he wants to be a famous drummer. So he runs away. Fred is a lazy bum who lives with his parents and does not want a job. Can they help each other out and improve each others lives before Carlos, the evil chick, takes over the chocolate egg factory and ruin Easter.\n\nI was fully expecting this movie to be an all animation movie. I was shocked to see live action in it. I like that though... it reminds me of Who Framed Roger Rabbit? I love that movie. This is not as good as that, but is still very entertaining.\n\nThe animation was very good and the interaction between the actors and the cartoons was great. You can't really tell that the actors are not really talking to anyone.\n\nThe character named Carlos was my favourite character. I thought he was very funny, i just wish he was in it slightly more.\n\nThe movie was very amusing and a lot of fun, but i didn't find it very laugh out loud funny. I did laugh a couple of times, but not a lot. But this does not take the fun away from the movie. The kids loved it.\n\nThe acting was good and the voice acting was also good. I liked the voices in this mainly because you can tell who did them. I can't see the point in famous people doing voice acting unless you can tell who they are. Russell Brand was the voice of E.B. You can't mistake Russell Brand\ufeff at all. He has a great voice and was perfect for this character. Hugh Laurie was the voice of the Easter Bunny. Again, you can tell his voice straight away... he was also a perfect choice. James Marsden was the main character in the live action parts of the movie. He did a good job, but he just has one of those faces that is good for comedy. Other cast members were Kaley Cuoco Sweeting\ufeff, Hank Azaria\ufeff, Gary Cole, Elizabeth Perkins and the legendary David Hasselhoff\ufeff.\n\nDavid Hasselhoff plays himself in the movie which is great. What I love about David is he does not take himself very seriously... and that just makes him all the more likable. I was a huge fan of his when I was a kid. Knight Rider was my favourite show and I even loved Baywatch when it was on. The Hoff was very cheesy in this film, but it was very well done. My favourite line in the movie was from him \"My best friend is a talking car\". :D\n\nOverall this movie is good and I enjoyed watching it... it just felt like a Christmas movie more than an Easter one. The sledge and the chicks pulling it around the world do the Bunny could deliver the eggs just seemed a rip off of Christmas which I thought was a bit lame.\n\nI will give this film 7 out of 10.\n\n\"She thinks Easter is cool. Talking rabbits freaks her out.\"\n\nFor more reviews, please like my Facebook page:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl"

I wanted to say that it was enjoyable but the truth is it reeked of the old lame Disney scripts that failed so miserably from the 60's and 70's. All too often the actors hammed it up and literally overacted to the point it detracted from enjoying this feebled film. Perhaps the kids will buy into the simple and corny plot but not the adults who expect a bit more than that. Again, it was the script and flimsy plot that let me down. Copycat of Christmas images like Santa Claus with the Easter Bunny was another sign of a weak story concept. Using a sleigh so similar to Santa's was just another example. 4 STARS"

        "review_detailed_main": "I decided to get an I-HOP tasting after seeing those very enticing trailers of this computer animated film called \"Hop\" about a rock star dreaming Easter Bunny. The aforementioned protagonist is called E.B. and is vocally branded by Mr. Katy Perry himself, Russell Brand. In the flick, E.B. is about to be crowned the next Easter Bunny in his hometown of Easter Island by the former Easter Bunny who happens to be E.B.'s dad (voiced by Hugh Laurie). However, E.B. does not roll with the beat of that drum and decides to hop away from his so-called destiny by fleeing to Hollywood to pursue his dream of being a star drummer. In Tinsletown, he meets Fred O' Hare; a California slacker who is housesitting the mansion of a millionaire employer of his sister. O'Hare is played by the other James Franco named James himself, James Marsden. Obviously, O'Hare is first startled of the sight of a talking bunny, and is wondering if he saw \"Donnie Darko\" yet one too many times. Eventually, E.B. and Fred buddy up; and with Fred's help, E.B. ends up in a David Hasselhoff talent show in order to pursue his famous musician aspirations. This is where the film gets very chipmunked (whatever that means) and follows the same formulaic route as the \"Alvin and The Chipmunk\" masterpieces (sarcastically coughing numerous times). Back at Easter Island, a petite chick villain (yes, you heard right) named Carlos decides to plan a coup so he can be the next Easter Bunny. Carlos is voiced by Hank Azaria. Russell Brand did nail voicing E.B. (I don't think no one could have done better), and Azaria was also quite a bad chick delight with his vocal efforts as Carlos. However, I do have to go egging on the rest of \"Hop\". Marsden was extremely annoying with his performance as Fred, and the rest of the human cast of \"Hop\" seemed as if they were doing the bare minimum to pick up their Easter movie paychecks. Director Tim Hill and Screenwriters Cinco Paul & Ken Daurio did find their way in developing the animated characters rightfully so, but they could not hunt their way at all in constructing an engaging plot line. For the most part, \"Hop\" is a basket full of ridiculousness, but Brand and Azaria saved it from being a.. (drum roll please) Holiday cinematic disaster. *** Average"

        "review_detailed_main": "What with Easter fast approaching, there was bound to be a movie that tried to exploit this market just as there is every Christmas with the swathe of below average Santa Claus movies. Hop gave me some hope that it might rise above the average though as it was made by the same people that brought us Despicable Me (but then again they also gave us Alvin and the Chipmunks, twice and soon to be thrice!)\n\nThis movie has obviously set it's target market at the kids and so there is no shortage of lovable furry characters and simple smirks to be had at their bumbling about. This means the movie isn't going to make you think all that hard. It follows two main characters- a rabbit E.B. (damn that's original although I'm embarrassed to say it took me longer than it should to make that connection) voiced by Russell Brand and Fred O'Hare, James Marsden, (spot the next connection), a human, in both the animated and real worlds. Both have overbearing fathers who want something for them that they themselves do not.\n\nDeciding that being the Easter bunny is not the life for him E.B. makes for the big lights of Hollywood to try and show off his skills as a drummer and prove his father wrong. There he runs into Fred and their relationship gets off to a slow start. E.B. is very much the protagonist causing problems all over the shop that Fred has to keep resolving which is where I think most of the laughs are expected to come from. Add to the mix the pink berets (a crack squad of ninja bunnies) and a couple of token celebrity experiences from the Hoff and Hefner and there is enough to keep the plot moving forward.\n\nThe animation holds up quite well and there are only a few times in the movie where you can sense that the animators just didn't quite make it work. I'm still not totally convinced by movies that put animated characters in the real world when the movie is not an action adventure or sci-fi but they are getting better at it with Paul being a good example of the tide starting to turn.\n\nIt was slightly disappointed that Hop leaned so heavily on the template that made Despicable Me a relative success. Despicable Me has the excitable yellow minions and Hop has just added feathers and in some cases another eye to give us the chick minions lead by Carlos (Hank Azaria). Although they provide some of the better comic moments they don't really have that same impact as the critters from Despicable Me.\n\nNow don't get me wrong this isn't a bad movie, it's just that anything aimed so one dimensionally at children with no real overlay for adult jokes or anything other than 'aww look at the cute fluffy bunny' is not really going to get me going. If you've got young kids then this will be an ideal way to spend an hour and a half otherwise wait for it to hit the TV screens.\n\nFor further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com"

Henry (Gary Cole) and Bonnie O'Hare (Elizabeth Perkins) have decided to kick out their unemployed picky son Fred. Even their daughters Sam (Kaley Cuoco) and Alex are in on it. Sam gets him an interview with a videogaming company and housesit her boss' big mansion. Very reluctantly, Fred lets E.B. stay with him as the Easter Bunny sends out the Pink Berets to go after E.B.\n\nI really don't like Marsden's character. He's almost 40 and looks like it. Yet he's playing a character more like a slacker twentysomething. Unless the character is actually suppose to be this bad, I would suggest somebody much more younger as a happy slacker. E.B. is only slightly better. The other problem is that the characters don't seem to be ready to be together. It's ridiculous that Fred can't get rid of E.B. He's a bloody rabbit. Their relationship ring false. The movie does get a little better later on as they go on their wacky adventure together. Only slightly better."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hop was a film that I saw advertised earlier this week, and was immediately interested in seeing it. And I am glad I did, as for Easter this is a treat for the whole family with a lot to like. As a family movie, Hop is cute and funny entertainment for both kids and adults.\n\nIs it quite perfect? Not quite. I personally would have liked Hop to have been longer by about three or four minutes, that way some of the human characters could have been developed a little more. Also, while the pace in general is fast and brisk, there is the odd occasion in the film where it could have slowed down a little to give the audience a little more room to breathe.\n\nHowever, Hop is a perfect example of a film that ticks most of the right boxes when it comes to a family movie. In my mind, when it comes to part-animated/live-action comedies, Hop is one of the better ones, much better than the Garfield and Alvin and the Chipmunks movies anyway. The animation is great, with vibrant colours and bright backgrounds and the bunnies and chicks look absolutely adorable, and the live-action sequences with its striking locations and crisp editing are equally lovingly rendered.\n\nHop also benefits from a bright and breezy soundtrack, and a jaunty score by Chris Lennertz that fit with the tone of the film very well. The writing is funny and smart, people might argue there aren't enough pop-culture references to satisfy adults, maybe so but as an 18 year old female the lack of emphasis on pop-culture references didn't bother me as I have seen some animated films and shows where it goes overboard with references that are either dated or distract from the film completely. If anything, to be light with that kind of humour was a strength as Hop wasn't really about that. Also the running gag about Hugh Hefner and the altogether different kind of bunny didn't bother me at all, but I can see why some may find it questionable. The script has some funny and witty lines too, with Carlos having the best and most memorable.\n\nI was also taken with the story. While not the most original story in the world, it is a polished and fun one that is fast-paced and entertaining throughout and because of its sophistication it appeals to adults as well as kids. The characters are all likable and engaging, more the animated characters than the live-action characters admittedly, EB is a zany and endearing protagonist especially. Tim Hill's direction is above serviceable, and the acting is well done. James Marsden manages to be likable without being bland, and Elizabeth Perkins is lovely to watch. Even seeing David Hasselhoff was fun. And there is also a lively vocal cast, headed by a very vivacious Russell Brand as EB and Hugh Laurie who is rock solid as always as his dad, while Hank Azaria is outstanding in a dual role particularly as Carlos.\n\nAll in all, cute and funny seasonal entertainment for the family. Recommended. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Hop\" is Illumination studio's sophomore film. They made a grand entrance with \"Despicable Me,\" but \"Hop\" only made a whimper. Maybe there's a reason you don't see Easter movies in the theater.\n\n\"Hop\" is about the magical world of the Easter Bunny. Little did anyone know that, like Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny goes home to home one day a year, but instead of bringing presents, he hides easter eggs all over the place. I'm laughing now because typing this premise is so absurd I had to laugh.\n\nThe bunnies as well as little chicks all live on Easter Island where they're busy manufacturing candies and bunny shaped chocolates to deliver. The deliveries fall on one bunny and one bunny only. Now that the reigning Easter Bunny (Hugh Laurie) is older he wants to pass down the rights to his son E. B. (Russell Brand), except E. B. doesn't want to be an Easter Bunny, he wants to play drums.\n\nE. B. Ran away from home to Hollywood where he hoped to make it as a rocking rabbit. He crossed paths with Fred O'Hare (James Marsden), a human, who also had dreams different than those of his father. The two became friends and decided to help each other accomplish their dreams: E. B. to be a rockstar and Fred to be a human Easter Bunny.\n\nIf you're shaking your head right now I don't blame you. Interestingly enough the movie was better than it sounds. It helps that the movie is quite silly. By not being serious at all it made for a lot easier watch."

Hop? I'm hoping that my favorite Dr. Seuss story next year by Illumination Entertainment keeps the Lorax and Mr. Onceler true to their characters and not adding LA lingo to a good story."

        "review_detailed_main": "I woke up this Saturday morning thinking \"let's put on a nice mediocre animation\". An easy and pleasant watch, that's all I wanted. Naturally, I didn't even get that! How difficult is it to produce a family fun flick about Easter? Getting children in the mood to feast on sweet sweet chocolate. Evidently, bloody difficult! Especially when the director of 'Alvin and the Chipmunks' is at the helm. Oh, and Illumination Studios. My hatred for them continues to grow! A bunny from Easter Island yearns to be a drummer, and so ventures to Hollywood where he encounters a worthless unemployed \"man child\" who must find his calling in life.\n\nMarsden. Why? Why do this to your career? You quite literally obliterated it, despite giving your best efforts. So, this animation utilises everything that I despise in mainstream family films. Firstly, animation alongside real actors. It worked in other bunny rabbit films like 'Peter Rabbit', but that's because the creatures were always in the backdrop of the real world. When Marsden is miraculously kidnapped and transported to the inner sanctum of Easter Island, it's an actor living and breathing in a green screen world. It's dumb. It's obvious. I hate it.\n\nSecondly, excessive pop songs. Drumming along to an auto tuned rendition of Taio Cruz' \"Dynamite\" in front of David frickin' Hasselhoff is not going to make me smile and dance. It's going to make me want to cut my ears off and place them over my eyes. I hate it.\n\nThirdly, terrible voice actors. Russell Brand is obnoxiously uncharismatic and cannot lead the film. His voice is more suited to an alcoholic skunk than a cute fluffy rabbit. I hate it.\n\nFourthly, no plot. The narrative is just a bunch of stupid sexually inferred jokes, like naively approaching Playboy Mansion (as if kids are going to know that!), stringed together to create a poor excuse of a story. The forced villain was forced. Supporting characters were non-existent. I hate it. Hop has no bounce. Hop has no fluffy bunny tail. Hop is hop(e)lessly inept, and I'd rather watch 'Minions'."

Clich\u00e9 2, the number two guy who has a diabolical scheme to get rid of the boss so he can take over. Put that together and then relate this whole thing to Easter and this is what Hop is. Okay I guess I shouldn't be too hard on it because I admit this did make me laugh, but I get the feeling that it's missing something. The two plots are as follows EB (Russell Brand) or Easter Bunny Jr. is next in line to take over the big Easter Bunny business as retiring time for the current Easter Bunny (Hugh Laurie). But EB doesn't want to be part of what his father wants and goes to Hollywood to become a singer. Meanwhile Fred O'Hare (James Marsden) is a human teenager who has to get a job. While driving he comes across EB and after settling their differences they become friends. Meanwhile Easter Bunny Sr. sends out a group of bunnies to find EB, and his assistant Carlos (Hank Azaria) an overgrown chick decides this is the perfect time to overthrow Bunny Sr. and become the Easter Bunny. But he's defeated and yeah that's about all this movie has. I guess it's not a bad film as it did make me laugh here and then but I just got the feeling that not much effort was put into it to make it original. I can recommend this over some of the other films I've seen but yeah. It's really just average."

You can easily fall in love with all the characters and it's hilarious.

Primarily consisting of fart jokes and slapstick, kids movies are presumably for kids and therefore somehow less than and not worth the effort. Why? With kids television and music growing more sophisticated and educational why do we continue to dumb-down their films? \"Hop\" is a perfect example of obtuse kids entertainment. James Marsden plays Fred O'Hare (yes there are more overly forced Easter jokes to come), a lethargic layabout with no ambition other than being a leech to his parents. Finally kicked out of the house, Fred's older, presumably more responsible sister (Kaley Cuoco) takes pity on him and sets him up not only with a job interview at a video game company but also a mansion in Beverly Hills guarded by two Belgian Malinois, entrusted to her by her boss. Fred's plans...whatever they might be, are scrambled with the arrival of E.B. (Russell Brand), heir of the Easter Bunny who shows up in front of his car. E.B. you see came to Hollywood because he rather be a drummer than a bunny-fied holiday icon.\n\n\"Hop\" is brought to you by the same production company that made \"Despicable Me\" a kids film that was intelligent, charming and dared to be a little risqu\u00e9 in its mean-spiritedness. Sadly \"Hop\" takes things two steps backwards with its cotton candy premise and its dull, uninspired execution. The film largely consists of Marsden hopping around the set trying to control a CGI rabbit which demonstrates we really haven't gotten that far since \"The Incredible Mr. Limpet.\" Marsden's energy is completely undermined and wasted by a lazy script, sloppy CGI/live action effects and a languid voice performance by Russell Brand who sounds like he just crawled out of bed. And when I mean lazy script I don't mean phoned in, I mean literally lazy. Once the two principle characters meet they do absolutely nothing of interest. At one point they sit at a diner asking each other what to do, onlookers paying no heed to the fact that a grown man is talking to a plaid wearing bunny who poops candy. I'd hate to know how licorice is made on Easter Island.\n\nHugh Laurie and Hank Azaria also lends their voices for \"Hop\" as the Easter Bunny and Carlos, a slightly offensive Latino stereotype involved in a subplot too stupid to mention. One can't help but think if Azaria and Brand were given the chance to ad lib a little this film would have been a bit more tolerable.\n\nAt its worst this film an egg-ravating movie that has absolutely nothing to offer even the youngest of children. It is a poached commercialization of yet another holiday that doesn't need it and an egg-travagant waste of talent and resources. At its best this egg-cruciating film is an uninspired string of stale jokes. How stale you ask? My puns are fresh and bunny-er by comparison.\n\nhttp://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/"

A few other characters including Hank Azaria as the voice for Carlos were pretty well done also, and one of the much more enjoyable scenes was when Fred O'Hare pretends to be a ventriloquist with E.B. while singing I Want Candy.\n\nUnfortunately, though, I thought the humour was slightly lacking overall, but if you have young kids and you enjoy movies like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Stuart Little and Alvin And The Chipmunks then I'm sure Hop will be a hit."

I did watch the whole movie though and I did rather enjoy the little evil chicken. Also the fact that no one seemed surprised to see a talking rabbit was a little weird too. It seems like it is just another chipmunk type movie, kids love it, some adults will like it and hardly anyone will watch it a second time. I would expect the creators of despicable me to do a little better.\n\nThere is the argument that this is a kids movie and yes that is true but why can't a kids movie be as equally enjoyable to adults like with Rango, Shrek, Despicable Me and so on?"

I didn't particularly like the Alvin movies, but they were bearable. Well, this movie blew Rango and Alvin out of the water. My five year old who asks, \"Is it almost over,\" five minutes into every movie didn't ask me one time. It was very entertaining, and the audience (mostly kids) seemed to love it.

        "review_detailed_main": "At times sweet and charming, but mostly relying on its eventually exhausting concept through and through, Hop delivers nothing more than an average Family film, and feels more like a Holiday cash grab than true entertainment. Although it doesn't exactly meet the standard of being a decent film, Hop is not as bad as it may seem. The jokes can be juvenile at times, but it's predictable plot, eye-roll-worthy situations, and simply hard to watch scenes make it far more annoying than need be. That being said, the film is surprisingly entertaining, and though I wasn't exactly pleased with the film throughout, I was never really bored. Hop has its moments of humor, provided mostly by Marsden and his interactions with other characters. His performance is a bit over the top, but the only thing that seems to fit in its right place throughout the films short run. The film doesn't have much of a plotline, and it seems to wrap itself quite messily towards the end as it seeks desperately towards a conclusion to concepts, character arcs, and ideas shown before. In the end, Hop is not a good film, but a decently entertaining one for kids. It has its moments, but is most problematic from its various structural issues. Marsden tries his best, but even his much appreciated goofy personality, isn't enough to save the Easter Bunny from making a mess of himself. My Rating: 5.5/10"

My only complaint about the movie was the ending; a little cheesy; but other than that, it was a great movie.\n\nThe story is about a bunny named E.B. who is suppose to become the next easter bunny. Growing up, he loved the idea but then fell in love with playing the drums (yes i know it sounds cheesy but it actually works in the movie). After running away, he runs into Fred O'hair (get the joke, O'hair. I thought it was funny) who is failing at finding a job. The two meet each other and E. B. ends up bunking with Fred. The adventure continues when E. B. meets David Hasselhoff, Freds sister, and escapes from the pink baraat.\n\nI TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE\n\nTOTALLY Recommend"

        "review_title": "I Want Candy",
        "review_detailed_main": "Hop used to be one of my favorite movies, and I'd watch it constantly when I was both 8 and 9 years old. It's not the most original movie in the world, but I still enjoy it regardless. I'd have to agree with what some of the other reviews say: it was high time there was a theatrical Easter movie with bunnies, eggs, and candy and isn't about Jesus. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against religion, but there were already a lot of theatrical movies about the resurrection of Jesus. There are also a lot of Santa Claus movies out there, but how many Easter Bunny movies can you think of? My favorite part is when EB and Fred upstage Fred's adopted sister Alex's Easter play and sing I Want Candy, and even the kids in the play and the audience sing along with some of the lyrics.\n\nI enjoy the animated portion more than the full live action one. There's lots of color on its visuals, and the characters look very realistic but slightly cartoonish or stuffed animal-like. Easter Factory looks like how I picture an Easter candy factory (or any candy factory) to look. Heck, there are closeups of Hershey Kisses being made and wrapped. At the beginning, it is shown that the main human character, Fred O'Hare, saw the Easter Bunny aka EB's dad when the former was a kid, and his family didn't believe him. Now that's something you don't see every day!\n\nThere are a few Christmas-like elements here and there: EB's dad (later EB and Fred) rides an egg-shaped sleigh pulled by chicks, the same chicks and a couple of other bunnies paint the eggs and make the candy like how the elves make toys, and they live and work on Easter Island like their North Pole. Now we know how the Easter Bunny's yearly basket deliveries work and what Easter chickens do. There are a few differences between Easter Island and the North Pole, like there's no naughty or nice list, and there has been a different Easter Bunny keeping the tradition alive from generation to generation.\n\nThere are positive messages here about being open-minded with their children and supporting their career choices. That's an unoriginal but important lesson for all, especially parents, and doing the opposite can lead to trouble. At first, EB's dad retires from being the Easter Bunny and forces his son to take over, but the latter wants to be a drummer in a band instead. EB runs away from home and meets Fred, and the two of them help each other fulfill their dreams. EB's dad starts to miss EB and regret his behavior, and when EB goes home, the former apologizes for the way he acted and lets EB become a drummer, but EB decides to become the Easter Bunny alongside Fred and still be a drummer too (it's true that Fred isn't a bunny, but he's a human Easter Bunny). Who said one can't have two jobs or both fulfill your own dreams and do what your parents want you to do (but if you don't want the kind of job your parents want you to have, then just follow your own dreams)? At the beginning, Fred says that when he was a kid, his dad told him that he (Fred) was going to grow up to do something great. I'd have to agree with Fred's family; he did grow up to do something great. Who knew humans could be the Easter Bunny?\n\nThere are a lot of funny moments present. One of the funniest moments in EB playing the drums on Guitar Hero (or a similar video game) and saying, \"You never had one more lesson. I'm the EXTREME ROCK MASTER!\" I used to randomly repeat that line all the time and say extreme master master in the same growly voice as EB, which my friends and family also found funny. EB playing the drums at end and making Phil dance, mess up guiding the sleigh while Carlos is driving, and cause the sleigh to crash is also funny, and that should teach Carlos a lesson for trying to ruin Easter. I got to admit that Phil has great dance moves!\n\nI'd have to disagree with most of the negative comments some people say about Hop, but it's not without its flaws. Like I said, the story isn't entirely original, and it has a few mean-spirited moments: at first EB's dad and Fred's parents were jerks to their sons and force them to get certain jobs (though this is likely intentional so they can learn the morals), Alex kicks Fred in the leg and steals his flowers after her play, and she tells Mr. And Mrs. O'Hare that sometimes she feels like they adopted her because Fred is a disappointment. Like Mr. O'Hare says, \"That's a very hurtful statement.\" Towards the end, EB's dad tells his second in command Carlos that the Egg of Destiny to too dangerous for chicks. He should've said so sooner because Carlos was thinking about being the Easter Bunny much earlier, and only the Easter Bunny can touch the Egg of Destiny. Overall, it's still a great movie for Easter or any other day."

Twenty years later, he is deliberately ignoring all his family's pleads to get a job. Meanwhile, it is E.B's turn to become the Easter Bunny. He doesn't want the job and runs away to Los Angeles with dreams of becoming a rock star drummer, and after several stops, Marsden literally runs into him. They both become distractions and helpers for each other.\n\nI think this film was funny, and I loved seeing Kaley Cuoco (Penny from The Big Bang Theory) in it in a great role as Marsden's sister, and David Hasselhoff in a hilarious cameo. Admittedly, it could have been better, but I still liked it. My favorite scene was the interview at the video game place. You might like it.\n\n** 1/2 out of ****"

In his role of Fred O'Hare he bounced brilliantly off the Easter Bunny heir apparent, E. B., skilfully voiced by Russell Brand, whom I also firmly believe has always given his best performances when he's scripted AND voicing a cartoon character.\n\nAs the two leading men, both avoiding their responsibilities they played great characters that worked well together. Finding themselves in a place where they needed to \"Grow up\", but in different ways that made the story great fun.\n\nIt had obvious similarities to 'Peter Rabbit' (2018) and small hints of 'Rise Of The Guardians' (2012) and all of the others films/stories ever made that have a son/daughter preparing for a role that they don't want or are struggling to find their place in the world, especially the seasonal ones.\n\nAnd another similar film, 'Sonic The Hedgehog' (2020) would pair James with another chaos causing rodent. Add that to his role with a Wolverine* and he's nearly got the whole zoo.\n\nWhile the gorgeous James (Cuter than the bunny) is always wonderful I also felt that the rest of the supporting cast were good too, although I have started to become a bit tired of Hugh Laurie voicing everything in exactly the same tone and way every time.\n\nHank Azaria deserves more recognition for his voice talents however, he was perfect as the plotting Carlos the chick.\n\nI liked the action film/villain moments of the film, which would have been quite simplistic without them otherwise. It added excitement and danger, in its 'Austin Powers' (1997-2002) like delivery, as it could only be.\n\nI also liked the idea of using the actual \"Easter Island\" (Rapa Nui) as the base of operations for the Easter Bunny. Not all of the kids watching will understand that it's a real place, but it will bring it to some as a new location to discover, so there was that educational element and aside from that it was clever touch.\n\nAnd I enjoyed how they mentioned the fact that E. B. was a talking rabbit, but didn't actually make it problematic so that the flow of the film could just happen without that being an overwhelming element of the film.\n\nThe animation was wonderfully colourful and paired with a fantastic soundtrack that made it cute for kids and a pleasure to watch for the adults too, so a win-win.\n\nSadly, I don't think that I've ever participated in an egg hunt. That is something that I must rectify.\n\nOverall I found this film joyful and entertaining and I will definitely add it to my list to watch more often.\n\n810.11/1000.\n\n*X-Men (2000)"
