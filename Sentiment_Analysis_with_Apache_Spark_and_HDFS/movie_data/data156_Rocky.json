        "review_detailed_main": "One of Stallone's first and finest feature film performances is as Rocky Balboa, a lonely, small-time boxer who gets by doing muscle work for a neighborhood loan shark. Everything about his life spells \"underdog\"-- he's even left-handed. He lives alone in a shabby apartment, and when he's not slowly being swept aside at the local gym, where even the trainer calls him a bum, he fauns over an introverted pet store clerk named Adrian.\n\nHe gets his first break when he's chosen at random by heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed, to take a shot at his title. No one thinks he can beat Creed-- not even Rocky. All Rocky wants is to be able to go all ten rounds with the champ, because no one else has. And in the final ten minutes of the film, Rocky finds out just how far he can go.\n\nWhat's terrific about this movie is that it's about Rocky. It's not about winning; it's not even about fighting. It's about Rocky and his desire to get by in the world without being a bum. The sequels to this widely popular film have focused more heavily on the upcoming fight, whereas this story focuses on Rocky's life. He doesn't want to win; he just wants to survive and feel good about himself. That's what most of us want, and that's why this film is a classic."

        "review_title": "A great Sylvester Stallone film",
        "review_detailed_main": "If you think Sylvester Stallone has made nothing but stinkers you just have to see 'Rocky'. This is a brilliant film, based on Stallone's own screenplay, where he plays a complex character in such a terrific way it is not strange people thought this was going to be a great actor. Compare it to another great film about a boxer, 'Raging Bull', and 'Rocky' will be better at some points. It goes without saying that it's quite an achievement.\n\nThe story is about Rocky Balboa (Stallone), a boxer who once had a glorious future, but now fights for little money in gyms. Then, out of the blue, he gets the chance to fight the heavyweight champ Apollo (Carl Weathers), a stunt from his side. Although Rocky seems to have no chance he starts his training to make the best of it, although at first he is too proud to accept any help. The scene where he finally accepts the help from his old trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) is one of the best scenes in the film. Rocky also starts dating the very shy girl Adrian (Talia Shire), sister of his friend Paulie (Burt Young).\n\n'Rocky' is a terrific film in every aspect. The acting is what amazed me the most. Stallone gives such an impressive performance it is very hard to believe he is also the star of films like 'Over the Top', 'Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot' and 'Judge Dredd', and from the other 'Rocky'-films for that matter. Not only Stallone is impressive, Shire, Young and Meredith find perfect notes for their characters as well. Every little thing that happens seems natural through their acting and of course Stallone's screenplay does a great job here. Director John G. Avildsen serves this material the way he should. Of course he is no Martin Scorsese, 'Raging Bull' stays the better directed film, but he knows how to tell this story.\n\nI do not like boxing very much, so a boxing-film is not something I would enjoy. But this is not a boxing-film, it is a film about a boxer. It tells about a character who happens to be a boxer running for a title. This is probably one of the points where the other four 'Rocky'-films fail and where films like this one and 'Raging Bull' and Clint Eastwood's 'Million Dollar Baby' succeed."

        "review_detailed_main": "For this review, I'd like to go through all the Rocky movies (including the most recent Creed) and talk about their good points and their bad points.\n\nRocky - The first one is obviously a classic and the best out of the series and made people like Sylvester Stallone a superstar. It takes a simple but touching story of the underdog boxer and rise to have a chance to be a champion.\n\nRocky II - I felt was kind of the same story and was a little cheesy but it still carried the spirit of the original.\n\nRocky III - Like the second one, was cheesy but it was entertaining. But I like how Rocky was doing more boxing and had more drama and Mr. T was a good villain even though he talked too much. Also it featured a great song, \"Eye of the Tiger\".\n\nRocky IV - Again like the two other sequels, cheesy but still entertaining and it had another great song \"No Easy Way Out\".\n\nRocky V - I know this one disappointed a lot of fans but I thought it was okay but I can understand why people didn't like it but I don't think it deserves to be hated.\n\nRocky Balboa - Was redeeming and I like how it has a lot of references to the first Rocky.\n\nCreed - Finally, this one was another great comeback for Stallone as Rocky and gave Michael B. Jordan his big break as well.\n\nBut you can't beat the original because it's the first and a classic, like I said before. But I'm still looking forward to the sequel to Creed next year."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's hard to explain what this movie means to me. Words could never. I remember when I was a kid, I never liked the first Rocky, was too obsessed with III and IV. It happened when I was 11 and I went to see V in the theater. I never been to a movie like that before. People were screaming and cheering. Shook the whole damn place. They were dancing in the isle's and celebrating. It was then I realized the true power of Stallone's vision. The realization that only the original would ever really matter.\n\nRocky to me is so many things. I had to beg my girlfriend to see it. She said she doesn't like boxing. I almost dumped her right there. If she wasn't so hot, I probably would have. I was crushed that someone could think that this movie is about boxing. To me it was never that. It's about a guy, much like you or me, who's down on his luck and everyday feels like Sunday. He's pushing 30, single and broke. I'm sad to say that at this moment it almost reminds me of myself. Every minute more another reason.\n\nIt's hard to pick my favorite scenes from the movie. I love the chemistry between Rocky and Adrian (Shire). When he's talking to door and she finally comes out and then stops to look in the mirror. It's a thing of beauty. Or when Mickey (Meredith) goes over to Stallones apartment. Rocky gets upset and punches his shitty wall, then goes to hide in the bathroom. The look on Stallone's face when he comes out to find Mickey still there is priceless. I heard it wasn't in the script or directed, just happened. But the one that does it for me is when he comes home in the opening scene after the chapel fight. He turns on his record player and goes for a beer, but it's empty, like everything else in his life. Talks to the turtles and his fish, why because the Rock is lonely. Goes to the mirror and practices a joke for his love. Looks at a picture of himself and realizes he's wasting his life. It's more than beautiful or real.\n\nIt's safe to say that I have seen the original more than 100 times. I still feel all the emotion. I love this movie more than any other film. I hope one day, with God's help, to show it to my kids and have them feel the same way. I think if I ever got the chance to meet Stallone, I'd want to thank him. Tell him how he changed my life. But in reality, he probably wouldn't care. Because, \"I'm at least half a bum.\""

It is my all time favorite movie series ever and I could watch every movies back to back time and time again. I have owned this movie series on Video, DVD, Blu-ray and owned just about every version going.\n\nThe main story is about one mans struggles to overcome the odds life has stacked against him but it is also a love story. There are real touches of greatness such as Burgess Meredith as Mickey as veteran boxer who does not want to train Rocky as he sees him as a washed out bum until he is offered a shot at the big time. Then seeing his relationship with Rocky grow. The acting is superb and the music still pumps my blood to this day. This may have been the movie to invent the training montage which is now a must in any movie about sports or fighting. Stallone's performance is phenomenal as the film celebrates the underdog battling to beat the odds and it is still amazing almost 40 years after release."

        "review_title": "NOT A BOXING MOVIE!",
        "review_detailed_main": "The first common misconception about Rocky, and something that's almost inevitable when you put a half-naked Stallone with boxing gloves on the cover is that it's a fighting movie. In that time it would fall into a category including Jean-Claude Van Damme and Jackie Chan. Now don't get me wrong, I like both of these actors a lot, they're among my favorites, but Rocky is not just another cheap movie about a man who like to win a fight or tournament because he deserves it (Bloodsport, Quest). Instead of a fighting movie we should say that it is a movie about a fighter. That changes the context altogether, it means that sure he has fighting on his mind but has other personal issues that are demonstrated throughout the movie. In fact in the whole movie there are two fight scenes (at the beginning and at the end) which together add up to about 15 minutes.\n\nThe rest is the portrayal of a man who has never had it easy in his life but nonetheless keeps his heart. That is to say that he keeps his moral and ethics, just keeps on trying no matter the hardships. A MAN WITH A DREAM... an un-realizable dream to be frank. But in the end, a lot, even most, of our dreams are un-realizable... but we try anyway. The difference here is that this man is given a shot at his dream, a \"one-in-a-million shot\". It's something that we all would like so we can relate and CAN'T HELP but cheer for him at the end of the movie.\n\nThe largest portion, in minutes, of the movie is actually devoted to the love theme between Rocky and Adrien. So that should maybe make this a \"love story\" movie instead of fighting movie. Adrien is another of his dreams, slightly more attainable which is why he devotes more of his time everyday to trying to attain it (her). She won't open up to anybody but in the end, with a certain amount of tenacity on the part of Stallone, she can't help but fall for the heart deep inside the rough exterior.\n\nAnother theme here is that of fraternity between Rocky and Mickey, his trainer/manager. In fact THE MOST TOUCHING SCENE in the whole movie in my opinion is one of about 15 to 20 seconds long and without any words. It's when Mickey goes to see Rocky at his home the first time to see if he can manage him. Rocky gets angry with him but keeps it to himself until Mickey leaves, at which point Rocky takes it out on the door jam and yells at Mickey who can still hear him outside. Rocky's life is being turned upside down by this whole \"fighting Creed\" business and although it is his dream, he doesn't know how to deal with it and is scared to get mangled in the ring, knowing he's not of the same caliber as the champ. The touching scene is when he realizes that he has yelled at an old man. His heart takes him out into the street after Mickey, he joins him and shakes his hand. The beginning of an enduring friendship which will ultimately lead to tears in a later film (Rocky 3 and 5).\n\nThis movie simply seeps with \"classic\", and by the end you know you have just seen a movie of courage, of the portrayal of \"the indominable spirit of man\" (Rocky 3). No matter the difficulties, Rocky's heart takes him through it all. It doesn't fit the mold of today's classics (like Private Ryan) with melodrama and grandiose scenery, just a simple movie, with simple qualities but very large meaning intricately woven into the fabric of the film itself by Stallone and the director John G. Avildson, with the musical overtones of Bill Conti. A classic from a different age, and the mold of a lot of movies to follow."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I was a kid there were only three major things in my life: food, wrestling and `Rocky'. My brother and I followed the numerous Rocky Balboa struggles religiously, and even today, there is no exception. Although the latest efforts of Stallone have been pitiful, the movie that made his career is the 1977 Academy Award Winner for Best Picture, `Rocky'. On top of that, `Rocky' also earned two more Academy Awards for Best Film-Editing and Best Director (John G. Avildsen).\n\nThis movie is unlike any other ever put on film. It's films like this that remind us of the beauty that is going to the cinema, and if only I was around during that year when such films as `Close Encounters of the Third Kind', `Jaws', `Saturday Night Fever' and `Network' were all playing in cinemas. The storyline takes place in Philadelphia, where Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) struggles to make a living as both a small-time boxer, and the brawn of a loan shark. Until one day, a sudden opportunity is handed to Rocky to compete for the World Heavy-Weight Title against the champion, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), a charismatic and flamboyant fighter labelled as `The King of Sting' and `The Master Of Disaster'. Attracted to Rocky's reputation as \"The Italian Stallion\", a match between Creed and the unknown boxer is set, which is subsequently advertised as a fight where a \"nobody\" can become a \"somebody\". Mickey (Burgess Meredith), is the owner of the gym where Rocky trains and later becomes Rocky's manager. Mickey is passionate about the world of boxing, and believes that Rocky has the potential to go the distance, instead of being `a cheap second rate loan-shark'. However, the central character in Rocky's life is Adrian (Talia Shire), a shy pet-store clerk, who acts awkwardly when Rocky even breathes in her direction. However, these almost completely distant outcasts are strangely drawn to each other. While one `didn't have much of a brain', the other `didn't have much of a body', so they worked on their opposites, only to end up together. The legend of this film when it was first released in the mid-70's was: `His whole life was a-million-to-one shot', but what Stallone did was prove to the world that `Rocky' is one-in-a-million.\n\nSeeing `Rocky' is both a cinematic experience and a religious experience. When first released, the film appealed to the widest audience, and all felt the emotion and intense passion which passed from the film, to them. The film's possession of realistic acting, superb dialogue and the most phenomenal music score by Bill Conti to date, indeed transformed the face of cinema. Stallone's wholesome performance of his own screenplay is electrifying as the film celebrates of the underdog battling to beat the odds. Fans of cinema aren't manipulated into thinking that the inevitable will happen as it does in every other tedious hero drama.\n\nOver 25 years on, `Rocky' still manages to let the audience's emotions explode; Rocky's blossoming relationship with Adrian, the seedy worlds of Mickey and Adrian's alcoholic brother, Paulie (Burt Young), and the affirmation of Rocky's inability to overcome Creed. And who could forget the excruciatingly compelling Balboa / Creed confrontation? Rocky's determination overturns the boxing fraternity, and supplies cinemaphiles with one of the greatest moments in cinematic history, as a body of spectators both on-screen and off applaud and chant for Rocky in unison. The following four Rocky sequels attempted to deliver the same magic as the original, however failed to convey it's message. `Rocky' illustrates how life itself is stifling and perplexing, but sometimes when you lose your way as well as your original intentions, you may just find something better.\n\nSimply put, if anyone has a free Friday / Saturday night, this is the film to go out and borrow from the local video store. It's unbelievable that this film was only voted in at #78 on the AFI Top 100 films of all time, and worse yet, was voted in at the SECOND best sports film of all time (the first went to `Hoosiers', starring Gene Hackman). C'mon people, be you black or white or brown or any other skin colour we have yet to discover, get out there and be inspired by Stallone's masterpiece, `Rocky'."

Stallone wrote it and fought to play Rocky. When they were low on resources, they changed the story all together and made it even better. The story is flawless and keeps you on the edge of your seat. 9/10\n\nMusic- The best thing about the movie itself. The music in this movie is guaranteed to give you goosebumps every time you watch it.

Burgess Merideth plays the boxing trainer Mickey. I have never seen a better performance. 9.5/10\n\nStallone fought for this triumphant movie that made me want to go the distance (sounds corny but its true). It made me strive to work harder and not give up. If you haven't seen this, buy it and watch it. I'll guarantee it will change you too. A classic.\n\nI give it a perfect 10/10"

Well, I recently bought the DVD box-set and after I watched the first movie again I knew that it was definitely the best in the series, and also one of the best movies ever made. Rocky is very much more than just a boxing movie. It's a movie about the unbreakable human spirit, determination, and the will to \"go the distance.\" Rocky(Sylvester Stallone) is a second rate club-fighter and a debt collector for a loan shark(Joe Spinnell). He becomes involved with a shy girl working in a petshop named Adrian(Talia Shire), and also becomes friends with her brother Paulie(Burt Young). Rocky's life really isn't anything of interest - until the World Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers) gives him an unexpected shot at the title. An old boxer-turned-trainer named Mick(Burgess Meredith) offers to be Rocky's manager. Although the whole film is outstanding, what follows are some of the greatest and most memorable movie moments of all time. Rocky striving to go the distance in the training scene, the final fight, and the closing moments of the film are so emotional and inspiring that they perfectly demonstrate the human spirit and can bring out the will to win in anybody. Add to this an excellent music score and you have a classic and unforgettable movie. Without a doubt deserved the Best Picture award in 1976. Exceptional performances by all the cast members, notably Burgess Meredith and Sylvester Stallone. **** out of ****"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Rocky\" is about a man. It is the story of a man who exceeds past all normal expectations and makes the most out of what he is doing. What is he doing? Boxing. Why? As Rocky says in the film, \"You have to be a moron to want to box.\"\n\nRocky is played by Sylvester Stallone, whose only other film before \"Rocky\" was \"Weekend at Kitty and Stud's,\" and, as you can probably guess by the title, it was an X-rated movie. But Stallone gives just about the best performance of his career here. Before he started getting into recycled action movies and unfunny comedies, the man had talent, as seen shining through in \"Rocky.\" Somewhere along the way he lost that talent, but it's pretty evident that he had it at one time.\n\nStallone wrote the script, which is about a down-on-his-luck Philadelphia man named Rocky Balboa. Rocky is your average tough-guy you see walking down the street, but this film takes a closer look INTO the guy walking past you, and not AT the guy walking past you.\n\nHe lives in a beat-up, old apartment, infested with roaches, and he barely makes enough money to support himself. His job? Rocky retrieves money for loan sharks. His real job, however, is to break the loaners' thumbs if they don't pay up. He's a muscle man.\n\nAfter he returns from his \"job\" every day, he takes time to do what he has been doing for the past six years, which is boxing. Then, after that, he takes a trip to the local pet store to see the love of his life, Adrian, who works there. He constantly tries to impress her and talk to her, but she is shy and literally does not talk much throughout the entire film.\n\nBut things change for Rocky after heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) decides that he wants to make a big performance on the 4th of July. He wants to appear nice by letting a regular Joe Schmoe fight him in the ring. All for show, of course. As he is looking through a book of local boxers, he points his finger at the letters THE Italian STALLION, a.k.a. Rocky. He says that fighting an Italian is perfect. \"An Italian found America,\" Creed says. If he fights an Italian-American on the 4th of July, it will be symbolic and will also make Creed look good.\n\nBut Rocky doesn't realize this is all for show. When he receives word that Apollo Creed wishes to fight him in the ring, Rocky begins to train long and hard with Burgess Meredith, which results in the famous scene where Rocky runs up an entry of stairs in Philly with the music \"Gonna Fly Now\" playing in the background. This scene is spoofed by films world-wide, and it's one of the cornerstones in film history. You will see it all the time. It's just one of those film moments that are marked down in history.\n\nThe most entertaining thing about \"Rocky\" is how innocent Sylvester Stallone comes across in his role as Rocky. You feel for him when he is trying to impress Adrian and she shrugs him off. The scene where her brother invites Rocky over, and Rocky keeps saying, \"Are you sure she knows I'm coming?\" is a sign of how the guy has been put down. And then when she comes over to his apartment, he acts nice and talks to her. He's not trying any moves on her. He just enjoys being with her. Rocky is a bit of an idiot, as he himself admits, but he's a sweet idiot.\n\nAnd the end, when Rocky fights Apollo Creed, is amazing. A nobody who actually stands a chance against the heavyweight champion of the world. Creed and Rocky are being battered by each other. Creed goes into the opposite corner as Rocky, and one of Creed's managers says, \"This guy thinks this thing is for real -- knock him out!\" You feel sorry for Rocky there, because he is giving the fight all he's got, when it was just a publicity stunt from the beginning, but he didn't even realize it.\n\nThings like that are what make \"Rocky\" what it has become over the years. It is a great film, and it has many classic moments that you will see spoofed in films all the time. You should probably see it just for that fact.\n\nBut the truth is, if you take away all the underlying intricacies, \"Rocky\" is just the story of a simple guy who gets a chance to do something amazing, and he gives it all he's got. I think we've all gone through something like that before, and if so, you will be able to identify with \"Rocky\" all the more."

        "review_detailed_main": "I hate to be one of those this-film-is-overrated people, but that is really the case for this film. Seeing this film for the first time (2014) I expected a lot more from it. I've heard so much about how amazing this film is and I just don't see it. It is a good film, but not great.\n\nThis is a fairly generic underdog story. The film is kinda boring until the last third and the chemistry between Rocky and Adrian doesn't really work. The way Rocky goes after her seems more like harassment than love. She doesn't show any interest in him. She feels really uncomfortable in Rocky's apartment and tries to escape but Rocky blocks her in. There's no way that two minutes later they're kissing. A big disappointment was Mickey, I thought he was going to be some awesome trainer like Mr. Miyagi but he's hardly in this film, and kind of a jerk. I'd heard of that one famous line of his \"You're gonna eat lightning and crap thunder,\" but I didn't realize that's basically the extent of the training he gives. The most iconic part of the film is probably the training montage (in which Mickey just watches him do push-ups and pull- ups) which is the best part of the film. I felt the words \"Trying hard now\" was actually referring to the filmmakers trying harder compared to the rest of the movie. Although without that song you have to admit all Rocky's really doing is running around and punching things. The final fight is alright, but fairly underwhelming. It doesn't feel like many of the punches are connecting, heck they don't even punch each other for a couple minutes. Fighting scenes can be a lot more intense than this, just look at the fighting in Warrior as an example.\n\nIt's not a bad film though. I think it was even quite good for its time, but it hasn't aged well. Maybe the film looks better in context with the other sequels, but standing alone this film just doesn't go the distance."

When heavyweight boxing champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) finds himself without an opponent for his upcoming match, he offers the unknown fighter a chance at the title as a gimmick, but doesn't count on Rocky's determination to go the distance.\n\nI watched Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull not that long ago, an excellent film, but something of a downer\u2014a gritty study of a not very nice character whose horrible personality and poor choices see him winding up losing everything. Rocky, on the other hand, is a real feel-good film about a guy on the skids who is given a once-in-a lifetime opportunity to make something of himself. It's an uplifting Cinderella story, a classic underdog tale that leaves the viewer with a big smile on their face, which is why I prefer it slightly over Scorsese's film.\n\nRocky also has a great story behind the making of the film which mirrors that of its main character: star Stallone went from an almost broke struggling actor to Hollywood mega-star by not only writing the script for Rocky, but also insisting that he play the title role. The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nThose only familiar with Stallone's later action hero work will be surprised at how good an actor he is in his breakthrough role, tackling the drama just as well as the boxing: Rocky's burgeoning romance with shy pet store clerk Adrian (Talia Shire), his friendship with her brother Paulie (Burt Young), and his strained relationship with trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) are all handled superbly.\n\nDirector John G. Avildsen also manages all aspects of his film with aplomb, with the final fight between Rocky and Apollo being the absolute showstopper, a gruelling battle of wills, both combatants pushed to their limits. Add a rousing score from Bill Conti and what you have is an unmissable, uplifting classic of the '70s.\n\n9.5 out of 10, rounded up to 10 for IMDb."

He's a nice guy from Philly who has a big heart. All he's ever wanted to do is fight, and go the distance. Apollo Creed gives Rocky the chance, and you're not given many chances like this. In Rocky's eyes, we see the fear and excitement mixing. He knows he won't win, he just wants to prove to the world, and to himself, that he's not a bum."

        "review_detailed_main": "I had the nickname \"Rocky Balboa\" throughout most of my life in middle and high school, so it would make sense that I watched this movie at least once, right? Well, no, I watched it for the first time five years after graduating from high school. I was never interested in boxing as a sport and similar entertainment platforms like WWE, but Rocky Balboa, the Italian Stallion, actually made the sport look interesting and his story is as motivating as it gets.\n\nThe idea of a local unknown getting a shot at the championship is the epiphany of an underdog story. Rocky Balboa gets that shot of a lifetime once the heavyweight champion Apollo Creed invites him to a boxing match after his scheduled opponent suffers a devastating injury. Creed expected an easy win and saw himself as the Goliath but somebody forgot to tell Rocky (the David in this scenario) that. The sheer determination, the training montages, and the love story that accompanied him on the journey to the big fight were as interesting as the fight but to be honest, the fight itself was the biggest part of the movie as it was building up for that moment almost from the very beginning and the fight definitely didn't disappoint.\n\nWhat did disappoint were some of the personalities we got to know in this movie. The vilest one of all would have to be Paulie, as he is selfish, takes advantage of his shy sister Adrian and belittles her every chance he gets, and doesn't waste any time spending his money on women after getting the cash from the fight. Rocky was portrayed as a thug too but you got to slowly love him. He refuses to break the thumb of broke construction workers who own money to the mob and does other little things that show he has a heart and some compassion. He might be dumb, as he describes himself, but he does show some glimpses that he actually has a heart. It was evident that he tried to cheer up Adrian when they hung out in the best way he knows, which was awkward and cute but what wasn't cute is what happened in his apartment. The way he came up to Adrian felt forceful and a bit uncomfortable, it made me channel my inner-Marie and say \"Hey Rocky! Screw you, creepo!\". At least it went well for both parties and they actually started dating. The following scenes between Adrian and Rocky were cute again but this one, in particular, was off-putting. Though I grew to like Rocky and his dumbed-down personality, I wish we got more than a sweet-heart persona from him, as he was just your typical meathead here with a lot of ambitions. Paulie, on the other hand, never grew on me.\n\nRocky Balboa, the Italian Stallion, did something that Rocky Balboa, the random kid in Lithuania, never did. He didn't give up. There was a moment in the movie where Rocky started to doubt himself. He said that he's not capable of beating Creed and was pessimistic about it. He justified it that he wants to go the distance instead, as nobody has outlasted 15 rounds with him before and he wants to do be the first one that does that. Meanwhile, I had the opportunity to land the job of a lifetime. I made it past the first two rounds of the application and had a similar talk with myself just a day before. Instead of facing my doubts and trying to go the distance with the last interview, I called less than an hour ago until the scheduled interview time to tell them I'm forfeiting my application. Why did I do that? Mostly because I'm weak and had a lot of doubts about my future there but I was also afraid, the commitment seemed too much for me there. Also, I haven't watched Rocky back then, and perhaps seeing this situation from a different perspective and seeing how it turns out could have given me that extra motivational boost to just go through with it. What I basically did was quit before I even allegedly got the job while Rocky went the distance.\n\nI liked Rocky. The movie was entertaining, though I did find myself being disinterested in the plot at some points. \"Rocky\" picked up the momentum as it went and kept getting better though, which lead to the final acts being worth every second of the build-up. I would say that this is a timeless motivational story that still works 45 years later, it's definitely worth a watch."

I hold this film close to my heart. Sylvester Stallone wrote the screenplay in 2 days, but you would never guess that judging by the depth of the film. It's an emotional roller-coaster that keeps you coming back for more. Rocky Balboa is up there as one of Hollywood's greatest ever creations.\n\nIt's a very basic movie, but that's what we all love about it. The best films are usually like that. Very rare a big-budget blockbuster will take home an Oscar. Not only is it a love story, but it's also a boxing tale as we go on an unforgettable journey with The Itallian Stallion.\n\nSylvester Stallone is my favorite actor, and for good reason. During the Creed movie he stole the show and should have won as Oscar for his latest portrayal as Balboa. Stallone is not only a great actor, but also a director and writer too. He can do it all. Some say Rambo is his greatest creation, but for my money nothing comes close to Rocky Balboa."

It sounds no different than a ton of old movies about the sport. But this film proves that it's not always how fresh or unique the story is but how well it's crafted. Rocky is a masterpiece of filmmaking with dynamite acting from Sylvester Stallone, Burgess Meredith, Talia Shire, Burt Young, and Carl Weathers. Many classic scenes, lines, characters. Bill Conti's score is one of the all-time greats. It was nominated for nine Oscars, winning three including Best Picture. It was director John G. Avildsen's best film and many would argue it is Stallone's best as well. Certainly his best screenplay. The fight choreography is terrific.

        "review_detailed_main": "Every once in awhile, a movie comes along that sort of breaks the mold. By almost all accounts, \"Rocky\" never should have even been made, much less developed into a cultural phenomenon. Fortunately, the stars aligned in just the right places to produce what is truly one of the most iconic, inspirational films of all time.\n\nFor a very basic overview, \"Rocky\" tells the story of titular character Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), a Philadelphia \"leg breaker\" who is a street enforcer for loan shark Gazzo (Joe Spinell) and does a little boxing on the side. Rocky eeks out a meager existence and tries to romance shy pet store worker Adrian (Talia Shire) in his spare time. When boxing champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) has a fighter cancel on him, however, the champ gives Rocky (\"The Italian Stallion\") a million-to-one shot on American's bi-centennial. With this tremendous opportunity staring him in the face, Rocky falls in with trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) and resolves to give it his best shot.\n\nThere is almost no question that \"Rocky\" is one of the most inspirational films ever made. Rocky represents everyone who \"never had a prime\" but is given a shot at one. Does he (and, by extension, we) take it, or let it slip away? That is the crux upon which the entire film is based. Much of this inspiration comes from Stallone, who drew upon many of his own experiences to craft such a true-to-life, yet engaging narrative. It is often tough to tell where \"Rocky ends and Sly begins\", so to speak, as their stories are so intertwined. Art imitating life in the best way imaginable.\n\nEvery time I watch \"Rocky\", I'm amazed by just how iconic many of its central tenets have become. For example:\n\n-Stallone's verbal and visual foibles produced a character that will live on long after I (or my children, or theirs) will. -Shire is the epitome of the unassuming, shy woman who gains her own strength--finally standing up to brother Paulie (Burt Young)--through Rocky but also provides him the same in return. -The archetype of the crusty old boxing trainer? Practically invented by Meredith's \"Mick\". -Bill Conti's simple piano melodies and bombastic brass fanfares compose one of the best original scores ever heard. -Even the location--Philly--seems like a character. Whereas Rocky gained strength from his roots, now that city draws much of its own identity from the character.\n\nUpon a recent re-watch, I was also struck by how little boxing actually resides within the film. The big Creed fight only takes about 10-15 minutes of screen time. No, \"Rocky\" is all about the character development and journey. Scenes of him ice skating with Adrian, punching the raw meat, jogging through Philly, or contemplating his big opportunity are what steal the show here.\n\nAll in all, everything just comes together in \"Rocky\" to create a movie that will last through the ages. Despite being a low-budget project that Stallone had to mortgage his future to get made, then threaten to pull out entirely if not cast in the lead role, the end product was legendary. It spawned five direct sequels and two more spinoff \"Creed\" films, all entertaining in their own rights, but there is simply something special about this 1976 original."

It was a small film, costing only about a million, and earned TONS of money and won the Best Picture Oscar!! No matter what you think of the later Rocky Films (as they got progressively worse) or the other films of Sylvester Stallone, you cannot take anything away from this tremendous achievement.

Now I understand why people scream \"yo, Adrian\", or why my friends burst into a run up the stairs at the Lincoln Memorial on our class trip to D.C. It took Oscar month for me to see the 1976 Best Picture Winner, starring Sylvester Stallone, directed by John G. Avildsen. I had some preconceived biases about this film. I am a huge fan of Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, a film also nominated for the Academy's top prize in 1976. I am also a fan of another film that was up for the top prize that year, Network. Since I enjoy these other films so much, I have shunned Rocky throughout the years believing my favorite (Taxi Driver) to have been brutally snubbed. Regardless of my feelings, it was time to see Rocky, and I'm glad I did.\n\nRocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is a simpleton, working for a loan shark and boxing part-time with a local gym. He is enamored with Adrian (Talia Shire), the equally simple-minded sister of Paulie (Burt Young), a friend of Rocky's from his neighborhood. As much as he wants to be, Rocky is not proving himself as a fighter. He is losing matches and performing so poorly that he has gotten the locker he has occupied for 6 years taken away by gym owner, Mickey (Burgess Meredith). With a brilliant stroke of luck, heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) visits Rocky's home state of Philadelphia. While he is there, his manager's set up an exhibition match between Creed and a struggling boxer, promoting the event as a way for \"a nobody to become a somebody\". They choose the most desperate opponent for Creed when they select Rocky. Dejected and seeing this fight as his one big chance to finally achieve his dream as a prize fighter, Rocky gets a manager in Mickey and starts intensive training in hopes of achieving a huge upset over Creed.\n\nRocky told a great story and was filmed in such a perfectly gritty way that related well to the titular character's plight. I wish there could have been a little more character development of the boxer, but based on the ending of this film, it seemed as though the director/producers already knew there was to be a sequel in the works. Perhaps Rocky II sheds a little more light on the intricacies of the boxer; I'll have to check that out. Chemistry was exactly what it should have been. Rocky kept an emotional distance from everyone, therefore, everyone maintained emotional distance from Rocky. The acting was true to character and believable. I can't say enough good things about the cinematography of this film. I truly miss the days where every movie was shot on film; I'm definitely not a fan of digital.\n\nI am happy to have seen Rocky. It is a cultural phenomenon, with another movie in the series being released just last year. Rocky also proved to be a very well-done film, regardless of my reservations over Sylvester Stallone's acting. As good as Rocky was, I have not wavered from my personal assessment that Taxi Driver should have bagged Scorsese his first statuette. Taxi Driver was a better, more developed film, but for a different audience. But hey, now I can say \"yo Adrian\" along with the masses now."

What distinguished this from all the other countless underdog-rises-to-the-challenge films is beyond me. It was a fine little movie (if not incredibly slo-o-o-o-w), but I honestly don't know what makes it a classic."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've probably seen this movie a hundred times. It almost defies review at this point. But I'll do it anyway.\n\nRocky is a small time fighter who gets a one in a million shot at the heavyweight title. On the way, he falls in love with the girl from the pet shop, and wins the heart of the city of Philadelphia as he seizes his one shot at proving that he is not just another bum from the neighborhood.\n\nRocky is a product of its time. Its series of events literally occur about 6 days after I was born. In many ways, one can point to the courtship of Rocky and Adrian as a quasi-creepy encounter, one that would not fly in 2016. One could look at Paulie and Mickey and wonder what the hell is wrong with them. And one could wonder why Rocky beat out Taxi Driver for Best Picture. But every time I watch this, I just love it. So many iconic scenes, so many moments that just make your heart race and make you love it so much more. It is inspiring, it is timeless, it is a film for anyone who ever needed to just hang in there and still be standing at the end. Rocky fights for anyone who has ever been down but not out, Rocky is anyone who ever made the most of a one in a million chance. And anyone who can say the last scene did not put a tear in his eye is either flat out lying, or not even human.\n\nRocky is so much a part of my childhood that I probably can never be completely objective about this movie, and maybe my 10 star review will not persuade anyone to watch this. But it is what it is. If it affects you the way it affects me, then maybe you have the power to hang in no matter what life throws at you."

So this review contains some English errors.\n\nI heard a lot about Rocky's legacy. But I didn't want to see the movies because I thought they're too old to be good. But then, Creed came out. My father watched the movie and told me, if i want to see the movie, I have to see the others. So i watched Rocky 1 with low expectations. And after 119 min, at the end of the movie, I was satisfied.\n\nThe movie didn't change my life. I think this movie is not even the best from the legacy. But, this movie is 40 years old, it's a very good movie, thumbs up!\n\nSure, the movie isn't perfect. The chemistry between Rocky and Adrian is very bad. The acting of Stallone isn't great at all. Yes, he is cool, i'd say very cool, great one-liners, very good training sequences. But in romantic scenes he sucks.\n\nThe antagonist, Apollo Creed, is awesome. I like him a lot, also in the following movies (especially in Rocky III).\n\nI didn't like Adrian. She is too shy, the acting isn't good at all, and the love story is a bit unrealistic. She changes her opinions and feelings in 20 seconds, first she doesn't want to enter in Rocky's apartment, and you'll see what happens 3 minutes later. I think you can imagine...\n\nA bit more about supporting roles: I liked Mickey very much. Pauline wasn't really good, with time he's a bit annoying. But he's much worser in Rocky 2,3,4 and 5.\n\nThe training sequences are perfect. Legendary music, a legendary Stallone, great pictures...\n\nI wasn't 100% satisfied about the box fight. Yeah, it's not bad, and the movie is very old, but in Rocky 2, only 3 years later, the fight is better.\n\nThe movie has some kitschy scenes.\n\nSo finally, this is a very good movie, and I think if I watched this movie in 1976, i would celebrate this movie as a masterpiece.\n\n7,5 points out of 10"

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie was a rather good drama starring Sylvester Stallone as the title character Rocky. It also is one of those movies that has a theme that sticks with a person because it is so memorable. The movie, too is memorable although kind of slow moving in places as well. They try a bit to hard making Rocky seem real, showing a bit to many details of his courtship of Adrien, though I have to say that these scenes while slow help with the ending making it a bit more emotional. The story, the heavy weight champion of the world Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) is about to fight a title bout. Well the person he is supposed to fight drops out so Apollo decides to fight an unknown guy and picks a local named Rocky. Rocky is a bit of a washed up fighter, he can win but he does so clumsily. The trainer who I think owns the gym, Mickey, decides to help Rocky train for this fight and these two opposing forces meet in the ring for more of a fight than Apollo was expecting. This fight is a bit more realistic than the fight in two in that Apollo was not taking this fight seriously at all and was not training hard. An underdog that he had never really seen before could have taken him by surprise the way Rocky did here. So a good fight sequence a some filler before then to pull at the heart strings and inspire one. Still good though for a sports movie."

I had never heard of Sylvester Stallone and had no expectations or preconceptions other than it was supposed to be a good depiction of boxing. I hated it when I walked out of the theater in 1976, and I hate it even more now. The film is one of sappiest pieces of melodramatic tripe I've ever seen. Every character is a stereotype, and every turn of its derivative, amateurish plot can be anticipated from 50 miles away. Now for the boxing -- a Popeye cartoon has more realistic action. It rivaled the most ludicrous exhibitions staged in professional wrestling matches, and any combatant who endured two minutes of the kind of pummeling depicted in the title fight would be brain dead. My contempt for this trash reached even greater depths when I watched it beat out three outstanding movies -- Network, Taxi Driver, and All the President's Men -- for the best picture Oscar (I've never seen Bound for Glory, but I have no doubt it was also a far better movie than this drivel). I can somewhat understand that a portion of the public would enjoy Rocky, but I can find no excuse for the voting of the Academy members. Shame on them for elevating this sorry excuse for a movie above such worthy contenders. It makes about as much sense as a punch-drunk bar-fighting buffoon landing a title fight with Muhammad Ali."

This film, even with the occasional technical issues and bad punches, is a wonderous underdog story that brings me joy every time I watch it. I wish this original story would have been made in this era with more attention on the little details as to keep those little pesky nuances from detracting from the story itself. This film is still very much a classic, especially with the need of an uplifting story during that time.\n\nI believe the writer, Stallone, and director, John G. Avildsen, did an immaculate job intertwining both the sport story and the love story between Rocky and Adrian, played by Talia Shire. The editing had moments where it felt a little like it was dragging on, even though it was purposeful, but the ability to effectively display the slow love in contrast to the fast-paced boxing was spot on. This film has a decent number of things that can be criticized which I believe has a lot to do with when it was produced, but overall this film, particularly the story, is a stand alone classic to my whole family."

        "review_detailed_main": "What most people don't realize is that Rocky isn't so much of a boxing movie as it is a love story. Well, that's what I got from it, anyway. The boxing is a big part of it, but we don't even get to the real meat of that story until about an hour in. And without even realizing it, we're getting a whole lot of character depth during the first half of the film.\n\nForget the creepy way that Rocky forces Adrian to give him that first kiss. The story as a whole is sweet. She's a true diamond in the rough. It's almost not even believable at first, but the two have so much chemistry that it works.\n\nBut like most of the movie, their relationship is without much conflict. Rocky doesn't overcome any crazy obstacles. He's a lazy boxer who hasn't made anything of his life, and when some freak opportunity presents itself, he finally works hard and gets what he wants. There isn't anything really standing in his way. Perhaps if they threw some conflict in there it may come off as contrived, but how it is now, it seems too easy. Maybe that's the point. I don't know.\n\nUndefeated heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) needs a new opponent for the title fight after his current one drops out. But he wants this new competitor to be a no name amateur, so that the public will get into the underdog story.\n\nAnd it's a good underdog story at that. You root for Rocky undeniably. But there could just be a little more in terms of a struggle. The biggest risk he takes is handed to him. And what does he have to lose, anyway?\n\nMuch of the film is dated with the fake punches and the already antiquated dialogue. There are points where the patter is so rhythmic that it sounds like it's from the '40s or '50s. It's a slow moving film, and some scenes just drag on for way too long. It helps add to the character development, but it does a number on our attention span.\n\nThen there's predictability. The end result is telegraphed from a mile away. We can guess what's going to happen for most of the film. And we are usually proved right--another side effect of there not being any unexpected drama.\n\nNowadays, we have a quixotical view of Rocky, the all-American hero. Even the Academy was lost in its gaze with this film winning Best Picture back in 1977. But sadly, it's not as good as we want it to be. But that's not to say it's not good. It's still a cool underdog story, albeit not paying off as well as its predictability wants it to. However, corniness aside, this film set the pace for countless stories that came after it. And most of all, it has a lot of heart. You can't knock it for that.\n\nTwizard Rating: 74"

Indeed this movies plot line is somewhat over-used nowadays, but you cannot argue that Rocky was a catalyst for the 'it's not the size of the dog in the fight that counts, its the size of the fight in the dog'. Sylvester Stallone portrays the wannabe fighter, and the character development is extremely touching on times especially as he forges a partnership with Adrian (Talia Shire) who throughout is tremendous. Sure the boxing sequences are a something of make believe, but that only goes to enhance the entertainment.\n\nAs Rocky begins to reach the big time he faces the ultimate task of trying to beat the American dream that is Apollo Creed and take his chance in the big time. Burgess Meredith is outstanding as the long suffering boxing trainer and his angry characteristics only served to give a deeper emotional side to the love and warmth he feels for Rocky. The direction could have been a little better and of course the story line is something out of make-believe, but it is undoubtedly one of those hallmark films that every generation should enjoy."

He's are largely popular figure in his community and desperate to date his friends sister Adrian. All this is very convincing. The streets look authentic, as do the buildings and the circumstances. There's a lovely innocence to his burgeoning relationship with Adrian and a credibility to the bums that inhabit his world. Giving a nobody a shot at the title is a bit of a stretch but a scene in Apollo Creeds office largely takes care of that. Later it sets an early bar for what became a ubiquitous montage and sucks you into really rooting for this underdog. The fight scenes are pretty darn good and again sets an early bar. The pacing is good as is the pathos. However, the characters are fairly one dimensional like walking plot devices and when a character gets heated, they tend to over egg the performance. At 2 hours it can feel at little sluggish early on but it kinds needs it to labour the mundanity of everyones lives. However, when it hits its stride it really rather zips along and the music is nothing short of inspiring. I really rather like the ending too barely acknowledging the result. SEVEN"

ROCKY, after all these years and a lot of sequels made after, including the recent CREED films, proves to be one of the very best films about sport, a sportsman and, most importantly, a personality - formerly 'nobody' rising to the top-notch fame and popularity.\n\nNot being a particular fan of boxing, I am not trying to review this film as an expert relating to some details about it.

Just see Rocky as a young man, seemingly 'nobody' an underdog with no perspectives, who lives in a poor district of Philadelphia, in an almost obscure flat (he says that 'his whole place stinks') and yet, is offered a chance of a lifetime - possibility to fight the big fight with the heavy weight champion, Apollo Creed. ROCKY is unique in that determination and the strength he finds within himself because...\n\nSylvester Stallone portrays a man with whom he somehow identifies (that was also the moment in his career - taking a chance that appears once in a lifetime). He has true, genuine motives. His personal motives are powerfully depicted in several scenes, particularly the unforgettable relation with Mickey (played by legendary Burgess Meredith). In the scene of Mick's first visit to Rocky's stinking place, the young boxer opens up his inner self and amidst the rage of his soul, the pain of his mind, he meets a true friend who does not turn his back to him but helps him out and motivates. Mickey understands because he was a boxer himself, he did have his prime and he knows what it is to 'eat lightin' and crap thunder.' Rocky and Mick's relationship is the essence of a tutor and a student, the essence of a good coach who knows the tough rules that are inspiring, astounding, demanding - yet never imposed. This is the power that Rocky finds in himself thanks to Mick who is there to fan the flame of the desire to face the challenge. And he does that truly effectively proving that he 'ain't no bum.' Sometimes, when you watch their scenes, you just seem to forget it is played. It seems so real. Both actors feel their roles tremendously.\n\nSylvester Stallone, apart from the tough world of boxing, apart from being the \"Italian Stallion\" he called himself, portrays a truly gentle guy. That is, in a way, something we like about Rocky most. It is not a typical 'macho' pretending to have no feelings. But where can you find this truth about the man if not when facing a woman. ROCKY combines this subtlety with timidness in the scenes with Adrian (played by Talia Shire already known at the time for her supporting role in GODFATHER). Thanks to Paulie (Burt Young) who supplies Rocky with the meat for the boxing sack and the woman for loving, they go for the first date. I loved the scene he takes her to the ice rink. Mind you that this scene somehow forgets about the tough world that is in the background and is a true depiction of some genuine, pure male-female fascination. The two alone on the ice rink resemble a couple alone in the world, just for themselves. Each of their movement, each of the word they say to each other (Rocky appears to be far more talkative) is here to stay in your memory. The moment he takes her glasses off and their first kiss (which was, for Stallone pretty challenging because Talia Shire was having a flu when she was playing the scene), her visit to his flat (at first so shy and hesitating, yet she made up her mind and entered the flat giving him the credit...as he later remembers in ROCKY BALBOA), these are the moments that you really feel as a viewer. As a matter of fact, her style, her clothes indicate this inexperience and that aspect of her personality is something that Rocky is taken with. Their love grows in the following parts, indeed, but it is here when their scenes are unforgettable. Two people outside of the world that imposes certain manners and conventions: \"But it's Thanksgiving. Yeah to you, but to me it's Thursday.\"\n\nSylvester Stallone, though he is not the director of this film, proves to know the psychological mechanisms that are behind the wings of the boxing rink. Imagine that Apollo Creed (played by Carl Weathers who, recently in an interview, still remembers this role as one of his key roles of the career) the master is to fight with some 'underdog' who trains on meat and dares say: \"I will fight the big fight\" This is the pride of a champion that is put to test, this is the situation when truly much is at stake. It is good to remember one scene here when Creed talks on TV and says to sportsmen seemingly discouraging simple people from sport: \"be a thinker not a stinker.\" This fear of losing wide acclaim is even more visible in ROCKY II but here, the idea behind it all is not merely a sort of 'rematch' but a guy - a 'nobody' daring fight with the widely acclaimed master that Apollo is. Very well played by Mr Weathers and their fight at the end of the movie is something that you can watch in slow motion even admiring every camera shot, every emotion evoked, dwelling in the spirit of competition, yes, but foremost courage.\n\nIt would be unfair to review ROCKY and not to mention a word about the very location of the story, the city of Philadelphia. It is no coincidence that Stallone chose this place as the setting of the story: those streets where he is running, those steps that he climbs while training early in the morning, the very background of rising from the bottom. The train that he hears in his small flat, the singing and street parties that he passes (Frank Stallone among the people), the character of Marie whom Rocky discourages from smoking and the kids that leave school and run with Rocky (yes, that is the second part but Philadelphia plays its role in all parts, in particular ROCKY BALBOA where sentiment is combined with the change and new reality).\n\nROCKY is a lovely film with lovely music. The soundtrack is something that can be listened to for hours all over again being a source of inspiration for training, a source of finding this 'power of spirit' from within yourself, it is relaxing and extremely memorable by itself but also fits best to the scenes. Bill Conti did a terrific job here. The theme song \"Gonna Fly Now\" and \"You Take My Heart Away\" simply have a tremendous impact on the emotions of viewers.\n\nROCKY is a rather simple story about a simple guy who trains in a simple way and falls in love with a simple woman. Yet, perhaps that is why it is so extraordinary that may prove to stand aside the masterpieces of cinema and dare equal them."

The story of his ups and downs,\n\nEven if boxing isn't your bag, or even sporting movies, Rocky offers so much more, yes it's a movie about a boxer, but it's his personal story, his triumph over adversity, his battle, his love.\n\nI watched this ahead of a job interview a few days back, simply to get my head in the right place, and get some much needed positive mental energy, it's quite staggering how this film can give you a bit of a boost.\n\nRocky is one of those movies that everyone has seen, and if not, they should. It is definitely a film that remains as popular now as ever, and for good reason.\n\nSylvester Stallone was born to play this role, he fitted the bill perfectly, for me it's still his best performance to date.\n\nSure some of it's a bit corny, some of the dialogue will make you chuckle all these years on, just remember it was made back in 1976, a different time.\n\nOne of the best things for me is the music, it's an incredible score, it really does hit the spot.\n\nIt's a great movie.\n\n9/10."

It's okay. It was needed to give us character studies of the main players: Rocky, his wife, his brother, his manager, etc., people we would see in subsequent films. Also, the fight scenes in those sequels went on too long, anyway. Frankly, I've enjoyed all the Rocky movies, beginning with this one.\n\nIn this film, the romance between \"Rocky Balboa\" (Sylvester Stallone) and \"Adrian\" (Talia Shire) was a major subplot to the boxing saga. It reminded me a bit of the '50s film with Paul Newman, \"Somebody Up There Likes Me.\" If you enjoyed this movie, check that classic film out.\n\nThe DVD transfer is excellent, especially considering the movie is 30 years old."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rocky is a high quality movie it won the best picture at the oscars and it deserve it. It is a sport cinema masterpiece and Sylvester Stallone and Rocky is the underdog of the underdog story's. Sly was always poor and almost homeless in the 70's, he didn't had anything to eat. This is the best sport boxing drama of all time, I have ever seen. I would say \"Rocky\" and \"First Blood\" are the best movies in the franchise that Stallone filmed them. They started all. I am a huge Stallone fan I love him to death and the first original Rocky movie is the best one in the franchise. I love this film to death and it is Sylvester Stallone's best, best, best acting performance of all time.\n\n\"His whole life was a million to one shot.\"\n\nRocky (Sylvester Stallone) is a down on his luck Philadephia southpaw fighting at local club. When the world heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) choooses him as an unlikely opponent in his championship bicetennial fight, he's given the chance of a liftime. What wa soriginally planned as a publicitystunt becomes a chance for Rocky to prove himself as a prizefighter. While training with his cantnkerous maneger (Burgess Meredith). He also struggles to win a heart of his best friend's shy sister Adrian (Talia Shire). With the love of Adrian on his side, Rocky tries to overcome the odds, fighting with all his heart in the glorious and brutal finale.\n\nRocky was writen by Sylvester Stallone himself, when he saw the boxing match against Chuck Wepner vs Muhammad Ali who went all 15 rounds to distance and he pretty much had no chance. The inspiration for Rocky was boxer Chuck Wepner and Sly wrote his own story based on that boxer. He knocked on all doors asking studios if they interested in a boxing drama most of the studios rejected Sly. Until United Artists was interested in to making the film with Sly in the lead. Directed was beautiful by John G. Avildsen who directed beautiful this masterpiece sports boxing movie. John G. Avildsen 8 years later directed The Karate Kid (1984) another competition's sports drama movie and actor Rob Garrison who played Tommy from Cobra Kai just died this friday and it is sad. John G. Avildsen also past away two years ago both director and actor from The Karate Kid (1984) rest in peace they are both missed.\n\nButkus Stallone was a real dog in this movie that Sly used to own a dog. In the early 1970's. Sly was poor and almost homeless. He had no money for him and his dog Butkus so he sold his dog for $40 so that he could buy a food. Just like his character Rocky. He does the best he can to get buy. He fights in the boxing club with Spider Rico (Pedro Lovell) wins the fight but get's paid only $40. He is a collector for Tony Gazzo (Joe Spinell). That's what Rocky did in this movie for the living to get buy, he was a good heart man. He grab a homeless poor men and he walked him in to the bar. After studio payed Sly for the script for Rocky movie, Sly tracked down the owner of that dog and he bought his Butkus dog back for $15,000. So Butkus the dog was in this movie Stallone's real dog.\n\nIt is a beautiful story, I love how they shot the mean streets of Philadephia how they showed people at night walking the streets. I love the beautiful shots. How people on the street were that time and not today. I love the training seqquence how Rocky was runing trough a junkyard towards Columbus Blvd) I love the song Gonna Fly Now by Bill Conti. I love the dialouges Mickey: OK, I'm gonna tell ya! You had the talent to become a good fighter, but instead of that, you become a legbreaker to some cheap, second rate loanshark! Rocky: It's a living. Mickey: IT'S A WASTE OF LIFE! The final fight on the finale between Rocky and Apollo was realistic it was real and the fight was for real. in 2014 when I was by my dentist for my tooth problems and I saw all that blood all that hurt I told my dentist this is like Rocky I bloody match and he smiled and he said you said that well see you next round. I love this movie to death, It is a beautiful sports drama.\n\nBurgess Meredith as Mickey, Rocky's tranior and menager did a great job he was the second heart of the film. The acting from everyone was realistic. Carl Weathers was great as Apollo Creed, he was excellent. Burt Young as Paulie was still great and funny in this movie. I don't like Creed (2015) spin off movie because it was remake of Rocky this movie and Adonis Creed was just a rich kid who had a daddy isuess and he quit his job to become a boxer for no reason. Rocky is the underdog, he is a poor and good heart. In my opinion Rocky is MILES way better movie than Creed movies nowdays and Raging Bull (1980) I never saw that film and I don't care.\n\nRocky is Sylvester Stallone's best movie her ever did, it is the underdog story in a sport cinema boxing masterpiece. Rocky IV, Rocky III, Rocky Balboa (2006) and Rocky II are my top four best Rocky movies of all time."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rocky tells the story of a man, Rocky Balboa, who is a major dork. It is the story of a 30-something man who finds meaning and purpose in life. Also there is some boxing.\n\nThe movie is somewhat muted and depressing for at least the first hour. Rocky is losing his boxing matches, the woman he courts does not engage with him and his job consists of being muscle for a loan-shark. The charm of the movie is it is very simple, very down-to-earth, very low-key. Except for maybe the third act when the great boxing match arrives, the movie is very quiet and almost intimate. If it were not for the big fight at the end, you could almost confuse this film for a French New Wave film.\n\nThe first half, where the many relationships are set up and where Rocky goes on a date with Adrian, is very sweet and very touching. It is very slow and there is a lot of dialog, but the love-story between these two misfits is endearing. It completely contrasts with the second half which culminates with the big fight, which of course Rocky loses. But the hidden moral of this story is that most if not all the characters are actually as socially awkward as Rocky (except for the overly confident Apollo, which almost bites him in the behind). The movie depicts the struggle for this young boxer to make something of himself, but it also shows how everyone has self-doubts and angst and fears of being rejected. Rocky goes through it, Adrian, Paulie, the coach: They all have to reconcile who they are and what is their stand in society throughout the course of the movie.\n\nThe biggest \"surprise\" is how far Rocky is from the mythological image it became. How distant it is from its own stereotype (similarly how the first Rambo movie is very different from the sequels). Rocky is not some overlooked athlete, he is just an introverted guy. However, it is one of the best aspects of the character. The whole movie is about this timid person coming out of his shell. At first, he is socially awkward, lacks self-confidence, an effective loser. Nevertheless, in the course of the film, in which the inciting incident is the Apollo Creed match, he summons the courage to deal with numerous social encounters. However, Rocky deals with these conflicts and tensions not by fighting them or make them submit but by resolving them and looking for compromise. By empathy not by confrontation.\n\nThe boxing only happens at the end of the movie, and it almost does not matter. The most important sequence is the famous jog at dawn in the streets of Philly with the triumphant climb of the steps at the end. That is what the movie is about: he starts the film with barely enough endurance, barely enough willpower to get to the stairs, and at the end he has made it through, he is able to reach the top."

        "review_detailed_main": "If there is a chance for you which can turn you from nobody to somebody, how would you treat it? Would you let it go pass because it is almost impossible to achieve or you want to use all you have to give it a great shot? This is what the movie about, how a struggling underdog became hero, legend or more. This is the one of my favorite movies. Because it has a simplest storyline but it successfully gave expression to it's theme-if you want to be on the top, you have to pay the price which means hardworking and determination A good movie must require an understandable storyline which clearly tells its theme. That is why I think rocky is a great movie. The movie is about the sudden life change of a struggling underdog boxer-Rocky, the world champion set up a fight between himself and Rocky, but he decided to give it the greatest shot just to prove that he is not a bum for a entertainment show. So basically, whole movie is about how Rocky trying so hard to achieve his goal: go the distance with the champion.\n\nThe acting of the film is another shinning point; it has many great actors in it. Especially the main actor Sylvester Stallone (Rocky) he made a great impression in my mind by his excellent pyrotechnic acting skill. In the famous fighting scene, Stallone performed an emotion of a boxer who is suffering from pain, frustration and exhaustion, but he is not giving up. The scene became so real because Stallone's incredible performance. Also, other actors like Burt Young (Pauline), Tailia Shire (Adrian) Burgess (Mickey) acted perfectly in the movie.\n\nIf there is anything else can highlight the movie that is the fantastic music used in the movie. Because the music played in the movie perfectly contributed to the atmosphere of each individual scene. E.g. when Rocky started his morning run, pumping up style music plays simultaneously while he is running, that generated a memorable scene. Also again in the fighting scene, a part of passionate and stirring background music played when rocky is trying so hard to stand on his feet, it has successfully reinforced the mood of the scene.\n\nThis movie is simple but well made. Fantastic music, excellent action sequences and incredible acting crew lined with a nice storyline to express its theme: a man can be anyone he wants to be but is requires great determination and stamina to achieve that. The movie is appealed to audiences who are 15 or above, and strongly recommended to every boxing fan! PG Rating: 8/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Rocky is the consummate boxing movie. But it's also the story of a man who had pretty much wasted his life. Sylvester Stallone's boxer has thick head and a good heart. He depends on other to kind of look out for him. Unfortunately, he has worked with crooks because it's the only living he knows. He does hard manual labor. He likes to box and because he is intense, he catches the eye of the world champion. He gets a gig as a sparring partner and eventually a fight with the champ, Apollo Creed. Of course, it's a circus. Because Rocky is not bright, Creed is able to abuse him emotionally. Rocky is a bruiser, taking as many hits as he gives. Not a good way to have a future. There are subplots, involving MIck (Burgess Meredith) and Pauley (who is disrespectful of his sister Adrian) and then there is the romance developing between Rocky and Adrian. What happens is that Creed thinks Rocky is a joke while Rocky begins to train seriously for the first time in his life. What eventually happens is one of the best choreographed fights in all of cinematic history. A masterful movie."

Although he certainly isn't the brightest person around he has a big heart and does the best that he can. Yet even then he realizes that he is going nowhere fast. Then one day he gets a call from a man who wants to schedule a fight between him and the undisputed Heavyweight Champion of the World who goes by the name \"Apollo Creed\" (Carl Weathers). At first Rocky refuses because he doesn't believe he is in the same class as the World Champion and doesn't deserve the honor. However, he eventually comes around and gets more serious about his training. But even then he has grave doubts about his chances. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a very good movie which really highlights the importance of never giving up and always trying to do your best in spite of the odds. Admittedly, the first hour or so is quite slow but during this time it provides the character development necessary for the intense action and drama in the second hour. This is especially true for Talia Shire (as Rocky's girlfriend \"Adrian\") and the aforementioned Sylvester Stallone. At any rate, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and recommend it to those who might be interested in a movie of this type."

        "review_detailed_main": "An extremely impressive screenwriting debut for Sylvester Stallone, not to mention a breakthrough acting performance, in this transcendent boxing saga that's more about the path to the ring and the tumultuous effects of both participants' personal lives than the outcome of the fight itself.\n\nStallone is raw and nuanced as Rocky Balboa, the punchy palooka who wears his heart on the sleeve of his leather jacket and tumbles through life in a barely-contained tailspin. He's awkward but approachable, blunt but genuine. When flanked by an equally flawed supporting cast, we catch Rocky's personality from a number of different angles. Finally granted the long-sought opportunity to date a friend's sister, he's clumsy and oafish. They both are. The climactic moment of their embrace isn't a Hollywood crescendo, met with a romantic orchestral swell, it's a quiet fumble on the cold floor of his ratty, single-bedroom apartment. That's real; that's personal. As a trusted corner man's alcoholism spirals into an incoherent fury, we don't find any easy resolutions. Just added color to an already-bright fabric, portraying life in an American downtown during the mid-'70s.\n\nThe film's simple, seat-of-pants production further reinforces that theme. There's no gloss here, no smoothed edges. It's heartfelt and meaningful, bare and earnest, from the quiet moments of self-doubt to the irrelevance of the judges' scorecards at the end of the big match. Great stuff."

        "review_detailed_main": "Although Rocky has been hailed as one of the greatest stories of underdog victory of all time, it is less about boxing and more about the love story that develops between Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) and Adrian (Talia Shire). In the 1976 film, written by Stallone, we follow Rocky in his journey of self-discovery and his influence over Adrian. His desire to woo her leads to her realization that she is worthy of love. Will Rocky discover his inner victor and be able to win Adrian's heart and defeat the current heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers)?\n\nIt makes sense that Rocky is the opening chapter to a love story saga, as we just get a glimpse of what is to become between Rocky and Adrian in this film. Although Rocky clearly cares for Adrian, his tactics to win her affections are questionable. The audience became uncomfortable when Rocky convinced Adrian to stay at his house when she clearly was feeling unsure she should be there. This seems more like coercion than love, and I felt the characters used each other more as support rather than forming an equal partnership. As a result, it left me feeling like the relationship was underdeveloped as the two had only established a dating relationship during the five weeks of training leading up to the fight. Because of this, I was left feeling unsatisfied that Rocky and Adrian could truly love each other but curious as to where the relationship would lead in future films.\n\nRegarding action, I must say I love a film that is more focused on the development of the protagonist over strong action sequences. It didn't bother me that the only action sequence in the entire fight film was the main event, which takes place in the last 20 minutes of the film. In fact, I enjoyed watching Rocky spend time developing himself, while Apollo Creed focused on his publicity. Watching this process was reminiscent of \"The Tortoise and the Hare,\" where the Hare was too conceited to take the Tortoise seriously. I look forward to watching how Rocky develops further in additional films, but as a stand-alone film, I felt the characters lacked development toward their full potentials, and quite frankly, the lack of closure left me confused and unsatisfied."

This might be a controversial statement, but it's my opinion. There might be movie that are more well made or that got better reviews, but considering what Rocky did on the budget that it had, it shoots past all of them. Rocky tells the story of a down and out boxer named Rocky Balboa, played by Sylvester Stallone. When the Heavyweight Champion of the world, Apollo Creed, , played by Carl Weathers, gives Rocky the chance to fight him in an exhibition fight, he must prove to the world that he isn't a bum, and win the love of Adrian, played by Talia Shire. This is an incredibly inspiring movie, and if you know what Stallone went through to get this made, it makes the movie even better. Watching this today, almost forty years later, it does look a little dated, But so does any old movie. That doesn't make it worse than movies made today. The acting in this film is extraordinary. Stallone gives an emotional and winning performance. Shire is great as an extremely introverted character. Burt Young is good in the movie, even though his character is unlikeable. Carl Weathers is charismatic. And Burgess Meredith gives an amazing performance as Rocky's grizzled trainer. The script is beautiful, one of the best of all time, and the direction is good, but not earth-shattering. Rocky is required viewing for anyone who loves movies, or really anyone."

He's been in the game for 10 years, but is essentially just a brawler with heart. He's kind and genuine and doesn't ask for much. Heck even the 12 year olds treat him like garbage.\n\nThen out of no where, the charismatic heavy weight champ, Apollo Creed gives him the chance of a lifetime solely because of how his name sounds. Rocky not only stuns the champ, but the world as he goes the distance serving as the beginning of his great legacy.\n\nThe acting all round is magnificent. More of a drama than a sports movie really. The music is incredible and really bolsters the overall underdog feeling in the second half.\n\nStallone's life practically mirrored Rocky's to this point. He was a nobody before this. He wrote the script, he acted, and was rewarded. Since then he has of course become one of the biggest hollywood action stars of all time. He truly has gone the distance.\n\nThe ending just feels a little rushed, and leaves me wanting an extra scene or two to give a little more closure. Nevertheless, a great film indeed that spawned a great franchise."

        "review_detailed_main": "By law in the UK its compulsory for the Rocky Movies to be shown once every 6 months and so we're all something approaching experts on the Italian Stallion and his best bouts. I therefore humbly offer you the benefit of my country's Balboa expertise. Rocky's one of those movies that's pleasure tends to defy logical scrutiny. On paper its a fairly familiar archetypal inspirational drama about a poor boxer who gets the chance to fight the heavyweight champion of the world in a one-off for America's bicentenary dreamt up as a gimmick by the champ himself, Apollo Creed, to celebrate the countries mantle as the land of opportunity. Fairytale stuff then, except instead of getting to wear pink slippers and marry a prince, Balboa gets to have his brains smashed out in front of a baying for blood crowd. Obviously Rocky, who already looks as though he has brain damage from too many head blows, isn't thought to stand a chance. Creed's the champ after all, he's got all the money, all the experience - it'd be like me picking a fight with Mohammed Ali (in his heyday not now naturally, I'm not a complete bastard) and as Creed puts his feet up and awaits the walkover, the sound of etching can be heard as the Stallion's marble memorial is prepared. Can you see where this going? Of course you can and that's the point. Rocky is old fashioned Hollywood - adversity and long odds conquered by raw guts, determination and heart. It's what America is supposed to be all about and released in 1976 it was barely a shock that the gutter to the stars tale was rewarded with a best picture Oscar. Stallone's titular meathead makes for a likable hero. He may be dumber than a box of rubber swords but the semi-audible lug is a suitably endearing contrast with the arrogant Creed who wins on points (stetching credibility would be left to the sequels) but loses the battle for hearts and minds. If it's supremely entertaining it's because we're all a sucker for this kind of inspirational bilge. Rocky woos the demure object of his affections, runs up steps, trains hard and all to the emotive strings of Bill Conti, who goes a long way to wringing the last shred of cynicism out of the audience. It's never going to feature in your top hundred but Rocky packs a punch and we all know he really won the fight anyway."

Yes, but the way ROCKY is told puts one of my all time favorites many Art Museum steps above the rest. Sylvester Stallone was actually an actor back in the seventies and quite a writer. His raw emotion and presence on-screen makes \"Rocky Balboa\" real and original. The film ironically parallels Stallone's now legendary struggle to get it made his way. Could you imagine Burt Reynolds as \"Rocky\"? Me neither. Stallone turned down a lot of money to just take a writing credit but he fought his way to the top and revolutionized the actor-screenwriter dimension of film-making.\n\nROCKY is as predictable as tic-tac-toe. Who cares? The music, the setting, the characters, and the fight make it the American classic it is. \"Philadelphia's favorite son\" goes through what no fighter in professional boxing could ever possibly imagine. (What world champ would pick a challenger out of a book because of his name?) Director John G. Avildsen puts the exclamation point on Sly's screenplay by isolating the characters and showing their depressingly small world on the dank streets of South Philly. Each performance, especially Burt Young's, is unique. Stallone's yelling match with \"Mickey\"(Burgess Meredith), his long-time, \"broken-down pug\" trainer is as powerful as anything Brando did in ON THE WATERFRONT. The movie draws from its cinematic ancestors well. The likes of BODY AND SOUL and SOMEBODY UP THERE LIKES ME are oh so present throughout.\n\nNotice the similarity between Carl Weathers as \"Apollo Creed\" and Muhammad Ali. Pretty close aren't they? This is not accidental. Stallone supposedly saw a fight between Ali and the latest great white hope of the 70's named Chuck Wepner. The two went the distance in 1974 and Stallone immediately had an idea. Several typewriters and notebooks later, he had a story no one wanted to produce. This is the essence of the parallel between art and reality. Stallone became a name and a superstar because of his spirit and fight. He reflects it all rather well in ROCKY.\n\nBoxing is a great sport to make a film about and the most important aspect may be the fight scenes. Of the 5 ROCKY films, the original has the most realistic fight. Stallone, who even choreographed the boxing scenes, has a great feel for the sport and its inner workings, all very essential. The training sequence provides enough motivation for any couch potato watching to get off his or her butt and get in shape. Turn your tube up and hold back the tears as ROCKY fights for his girl, his city, and his name.\n\nRATING: 10 OF 10"

        "review_detailed_main": "What makes a great film? Engaging characters, immersive story-line, brilliant editing, fantastic music, an experience you can revisit again and again. Rocky has all of this and more.\n\nWhen it comes to performance I honestly do not know where Rocky starts and Sylvester Stallone ends. Stallone did not just play this character he conceived, created and crafted it. This is not method acting this goes way beyond that.\n\nWhat is this film about? Loneliness, love, self-respect, poverty, heartache, shyness, chance, pride, friendship, boxing? It is about life!\n\nRocky is a downtrodden character, in the words of Mickey (Burgess Meredith) Rocky is a bum, a loser, he had talent but never applied it. Rocky does not see this, he lives his life, he has some boxing skills which he puts to use in the occasional low-key cash fights and working as a money collector for the local crime lord (Joe Spinell). Rocky has the physical attributes for the debt collecting job but deep down he has a soft heart. He is not the smartest guy but ultimately he is a good guy.\n\nRocky is friends with Paulie (Burt Young) who is a deeply flawed character. Unlike Rocky he has a chip on his shoulder at life and the cards he has been dealt. Paulie has a sister Adrian (Talia Shire) that has not had an easy life either. She is painfully shy and introverted. Adrian works at the local pet shop which Rocky visits often. Rocky tries to make conversation and get to know her. The courtship between Adrian and Rocky is awkward at times but has a reality and sweetness that is undeniable. Rocky and Adrian eventually date.\n\nRocky's life is on a nowhere trajectory until out the blue his name is selected by Apollo Creed (Carl weathers) the heavy weight champion of the world as a publicity stunt. Apollo Creed wants to stage a boxing event where a lowly ranked amateur boxer gets a chance to fight for the title, \"The American dream\". Initially stunned and unwilling to take on this challenge, Rocky does not feel he is worthy or capable of this. Mickey eventually persuades Rocky to take this once in a lifetime chance. And so begins the rest of the film. Cue training montage.\n\nRocky works on many levels, that is why it is such a fantastic film. The characters have a human naivety and poignancy that resonates. The editing and music are sublime in parts. It is a film I will watch again and again and appreciate more each time 10 out of 10."

I know it's been on TV recently and that's partly why I wanted to watch the full movie when I saw it on Netflix. I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was.\n\nI know since watching this movie that I had been missing at least one important 'cultural reference' that you wouldn't get until you've seen Rocky - that is, him yelling out \"AAaadriaaan!\" which is also a quote in the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie (which I also love ;) ).\n\nStallone's character was surprisingly interesting to me and I thought he was a real sweetie. I found the story compelling too. As other reviewers have mentioned, it's much more than just a boxing movie. I really enjoyed the fact that he went after a girl who was, let's face it, quite dowdy and not your typical love interest in any Hollywood movie. I thought their love story was really sweet, though I could relate to Adrian not wanting to watch him get beaten up in the fight!\n\nOne other thing to love about this movie is the classic theme song, too. And I finally got to see what that guy was talking about when I visited Philadelphia as a teenager - the steps Rocky ran up. That was back in 1997 that I saw those steps - I'm glad I finally know what that reference was about!\n\nI haven't seen any of the others as yet, but I know they're available on Netflix. I have a feeling they won't be quite as good as the first, just like I prefer the first Lethal Weapon movie to all the others I've seen."

        "review_detailed_main": "In my opinion, Stallone stars in the greatest boxing movie of all time. Raging Bull, arguably the 2nd, does not even touch it. Stallone is an Italian hack boxer, in the underbelly of Philadelphia's rough boxing scene, fighting over the hill has been's, never-will-be's, and never have been's until his name is almost drawn from a hat, so to speak, by Apollo Creed's (The current world heavy weight champion) management at a time when the boxing world lacks solid contenders and Apollo figures that it will make him more popular with the fans if he gives a nobody a shot, but his manager thinks he might be barking up the wrong tree by picking a south paw that he knows nothing about. Apollo, being a business man, selects Rocky based on his ring name \"The Italian Stallion.\" Rocky is in an inner city friend to the Italian Catholic community who stands behind him as he trains on the streets of the bicentennial city, in underground boxing gyms and in a meat locker, where he works for his future brother in law, by punching large slabs of meat into submission, in cold freezers. It's also a story about a simple man, in love with his city, culture, church and a simple girl, Adrien, who is the clerk at a pet shop below his apartment where he shops for turtle food, that he does not need, in order to have conversations with his future wife, who I might add, he never cheats on through 5 Rocky's (Refreshing). It's a blue collar story about the American dream. If you have not seen it, I insist. If you wonder how Sylvestor became a star. Stop wondering. Rent the movie and you will get the answers to your question."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sure, I get that the 1976 movie \"Rocky\" from writer Sylvester Stallone and director John G. Avildsen is a classic, but having just had the opportunity again here in 2022 to sit down and watch the movie once again, I have to say that this is actually not a masterpiece of a movie.\n\nThe story is adequate, I mean in the terms of an underdog going up against the undisputed champion and managing to go 15 rounds of physical pounding in the ring. And it is a story of perseverance and going after your goals and following your ambition. Sure, that is all good.\n\nBut the character Rocky is actually incredibly awkward to watch on the screen, as he is stumbling through some insanely toe-curling dialogue, and watching him being so very socially awkward as well. It is just hard to actually take the Rocky character all that serious in this first movie. Sure, it was good from a boxing point of view, but in terms of character gallery, then it was a bitter pill to swallow.\n\nI am not saying that Sylvester Stallone wasn't doing a good job, because he certainly does portray the character well enough. But the character itself is just a goof and difficult to really take serious if it wasn't for his boxing skills.\n\nAnd while we are on the character gallery, then Paulie (played by Burt Young) is just an obnoxious brother, friend and a mean person in general. And Apollo Creed (played by Carl Weathers) wasn't given the on-screen time he deserved, because he was essentially just the champion that Rocky had to fight, nothing else.\n\nThe music in the movie is good, and that definitely has become a defining score for a franchise.\n\nSure, \"Rocky\" is a watchable movie, but for me it just isn't all that great of a movie.\n\nMy rating of the 1976 movie \"Rocky\" lands on a six out of ten stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "A stunner of a movie, Rocky gives inspiration in making people realize you can do anything if you put your mind, body, and soul into it. You might think this is just another movie showing that your dreams can come true. Not this one. This is a gritty real-life story. Taking place in the city of Philadelphia, Rocky (Syvester Stallone) is an out of shape hoodlum who pretends to be a boxer and gets picked to fight the world's number one boxer in front of a worldwide audience. A true underdog story, based losely off a story of Chuck Webner facing Muhammad Ali, this movie, is sure to not disappoint.\n\nIn the movie Rocky, one of the most powerful messages includes not everything is about winning or losing. Sometimes it's about giving your best and living with whatever the outcome may be. Rocky is the underdog and no match for the world champ, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers). However, Rocky views this as his one opportunity to go big time in boxing. While being a huge task, he isn't going to back down from the challenge of fighting someone better. The grit within Rocky is hard to come across, and it is what can make one successful.\n\nThe acting portrayed by Sylvestor Stallone is phenomenal.. It's hard to not want to root for the guy in his journey because you see Rocky as a tough guy but he actually has a big soft side that is touching to see. Without Stallone's amazing acting, you most likely wouldn't be getting the same experience. Like many, Rocky does not have a lot of direction in his life. We can see ourselves through him. He is a bum and works as an enforcer for the local loan shark, while boxing on the side. When trying to give advice to a younger girl in the neighborhood, the girl does not listen to Rocky and calls him a \"creepo.\" Rocky was just trying to do the right thing and help this girl out, but questions himself after the fact and thinks to himself, \"yeah who are you to give advice anyway.\" You see the big heart that Rocky has and although he may not be the brightest, he is a good person. Like mentioned before, he has this persona of a tough guy but it's the moments like these that demonstrate the soft side of Rocky. The portrayal done by Stallone makes you can't help but root for Rocky.\n\nWhat works very well with this movie is the character dynamics. Mickey plays the role of Rocky's manager and trainer. It's almost like a harsh father son relationship. Mickey however isn't the father that damaged Rocky, he's the first to believe in him. Mickey (Burgess Meredith) had blown his shot in boxing and views Rocky as his opportunity back in. He wants to show Rocky all the mistakes made in his experience to ensure Rocky does not do the same. He is tough on Rocky and a hard character to like at first. Burgess Meredith kills the role with his angry sounding voice and funniness that makes Micky an endearing character. To balance Rocky, Adrian (Talia Shire), Rocky's girlfriend, gives him comfort and love he needs through the movie. This is a big burly man in Rocky and a shy and timid girl in Adrian. It's intriguing because they should not mix. Apollo Creed is also a fantastic character. Weathers does a great job portraying Apollo's cockiness in the sport and also his love of boxing. Apollo is the catalyst Rocky needs to bring his true self out.\n\nSo you might think that this is just a boxing underdog story but there is a much bigger message behind it. This movie is recommended to every young kid or even adult. That point is that in America a man can turn himself around from a bum up to a worthy challenger of the best fighter in the world in a short matter of time. All he had to do was believe in himself. This goes for anything in life and it does not have to be boxing. This is the land of the free and opportunity here in America. If you put your mind to what you want to achieve, anything is possible. Rocky lifted himself up from the ground and made himself into someone. In the end, if you persevere you will be standing after 15 rounds, just like Rocky Balboa."

The good thing about it is that Sylvester Stallone obviously has some kind of dream, motivation, determination, just like his on-screen persona.\n\nThe bad thing is, John G. Avildsen might as well be directing \"Rocky Watches Grass Grow,\" as nothing truly great happens until at least the last third of the movie. Burt Young and Talia Shire seem to live for their shouting matches, which are not that impressive when compared, say, to \"Reds\" or \"The Godfather\". Carl Weathers helps boost things, but it isn't until \"Rocky II\" that his character gets a fair shake.\n\nIt's a shame that for a movie this acclaimed, more couldn't have happened. But for many people, it is still the ultimate inspirational picture, that delivers a clever message with at least a couple ounces of ingenuity.\n\nIn other words, \"Rocky\" is a movie backed by a dream, but the dream is never quite fulfilled."

Stallone's \"acting\" is obnoxious. Adrian is a dead fish with zero personality or energy that he basically stalks. Carl Weathers is the best part of this movie and the only thing in it worth watching.\n\nI do give it credit for the ending. I knew it was coming, but considering when this came out I'm impressed they ended it like they did. Maybe that's part of the problem. This movie has been hyped up to me my whole life. Rocky is this great bit of pop culture history, something I had never seen and now, finally marking it off the list and frankly, I was bored. I wanted it to be over. I imagine if I had the nostalgia to back it up, maybe this would be a different story but without that, it was really an underwhelming flick."

It depicts not only an underdog in the ring, but an underdog in life.\n\nThe screenplay unites Rocky's dual identity forming a parallelism in the plot that rings true for so many, making a masterpiece of a movie. The only faltering point is the undoubtedly clich\u00e9d nature, which squeezes the originality of the movie dry. The acting is superb: Sylvester Stallone as the despairing, no-life Itallian Stallion, Talia Shire as the estranged, beautiful- on-the-inside Adrian, Burt Young as the desperate alcoholic Paulie, and Burgess Meredith as the wistful trainer Mickey. Each actor perfectly adopts the mindset of each desirous character searching for their own American dream. What can be said about the training montage and its filming, except describing its utter perfection. The soundtrack also works to inspire hope in the audience for the hopeless underdog.\n\nThe director worked against all odds to finish this film with class. A million dollar budget, 28 days to shoot, and Stallone's stubbornness to work against, but he pulled it off. He created an underdog movie that rose up and won Best Picture about an underdog.\n\nRocky is a perfection of the clich\u00e9d underdog that may never be achieved again.\n\n9/10"

The film still demands our attention, because it is a classic.\n\nI understand the whole, give-the-little-guy-the-break concept and I do see where he takes that energy. I totally understand the Philadelphia connection and the feel-good ending (I can't possibly be spoiling anything here), but I feel that this movie pulled off the same miracle that Crash (2004), did 30 years later. They managed to sell a simple story, seen many times before, that just happened to convince the Academy that it was the best thing seen in the theaters all that year.\n\nRocky was a slow boil, but never really delivered as much as you would like, even with the boxing finale. I do like him, but Stalone is tough to watch and hard to understand in this film The film really does not grab you and can be tedious at times, however the boxing match is as fun as all the others. The film is still a must-see, but be ready for less energy than a punch.\n\n7.6 (C+ MyGrade) = 7 IMDB"

        "review_detailed_main": "My dad showed this movie to me and my brothers when we were little and I remember them walking around saying \"hey yo Adrian!\" for days. My older brother even made me a birthday card with a stick figure wearing boxing gloves and ice skates that said \"Hey Yo Lydia, Happy Birthday\". It didn't have the same effet on me, however, I quickly forgot about it. I was just too young understand it. My brothers were too. They just liked it because they thought Rocky talked funny. Watching Rocky now that I'm older I see that it is so much more than a boxing movie about a guy who talks kind of funny. It is a movie with heart. It is a movie about determination and strength. Strength of spirt more than of body, although Rocky can really throw a punch (and take one as well) and that training montage will forever be awesome. Rocky is one of the most endearing characters ever in my opinion. He is someone who you just can't help but root for (just watch Rocky IV). But he isn't without his flaws either, he is a real person and that just adds to the likeabillity of the character. He seems like someone you would know. And the love story between him and Adrian will forever be one of my all time favorite love stories. It is just so sweet and it adds depth to Rocky's character.I honestly can't even fully express how much I love this movie and character.\n\nJust go watch it OK! you won't regret it!"

It's been almost a 40 years and it is still alive and kicking and all thanks to the amazing Sylvester Stallone who fought and bled to star in this movie for which he banged up the script in matter of days. Rocky is an amazing movie which kind of reflects on the life of Sylvester Stallone back in the days. Also for any younger generations as myself who didn't get the chance to watch it back in the 70s I would absolutely recommend it. It's a beginning of a franchise you don't really get to see today. This is 2 hours of your life you will never want back because it's worth every single second of watching it."

        "review_detailed_main": "What can be said about Rocky that hasn't already been said. It is uplifing, well made, well directed, well acted, well scored and well, it is \" well \" everything. This is the movie that started one of the greatest heroes and greatest careers in the history of Hollywood. And it proves that in life and on the screen if you want something bad enough, you have to go out and take it, because no one is going to give it to you. To tell you what this film is about and then give a small critique is rather pointless. We all know about Rocky. And my review is not going to do anything to enhance your like or dislike of the film. By now, you either like the character or you don't. You like Stallone or you don't. So judge for yourself if this film is good or not. I personally think it is great. But for me this was much more than a film. This is much more than a metaphor about life. To me, this is a Bible for anyone who has a dream.\n\nStallone put his life on the line to get this movie made. He believed in himself and he believed in what he had to say. He was offered a huge amount of money to sell the film and let someone else play Rocky. He held out and told them that he wanted the title role and even though at the time his wife was pregnant, they had very little money and he was hanging by a thread, he took that stand. And the rest is history. Could you imagine anyone else in that role now? Does anyone really fit the mold that Stallone made for us? No. And this film inspires me to be more than I am. It inspires the dreamer in all of us to go for what we want and damn the consequences. If I ever meet Stallone one day, I will personally thank him for making this film. It changed my life forever and gave me hope to make my dream come true. Rocky didn't stop until his dream came true and neither did Stallone. Why should I? Why should anyone?"

That moment when Rocky goes in Adrian's arms in the bed and accepts the fear for upcoming day, says he can't defeat Creed, but still promises to himself and her, to go the distance, I mean that's what courage is. If you have the conviction despite of what the world or even you for that matter think, then that's it. That's the only thing that matters, going the distance, no matter what the outcome is. We know that it's all about the journey. And if in those times you have somebody by your side, it's better. Somebody who could believe in you more than you do. Another thing worth emulating of Rocky is \"Getting up again\", be it from your bed or that boxing ring of the world around. Mickey, any less than that wouldn't have even been qualified for the job. \"women weaken your legs\", if that is to be believed then only one fierce like him can keep them away from you. 9/10 for #Rocky1976"

Even for a 1976 Best Picture Oscar, the film really isn't all THAT great, until you're caught by the outstanding wonders of Sylvester Stallone's personally talented writing and his impressive street bum character of \"The Italian Stallion\". There are no stellar production values as expected from an upper-class Hollywood, but it's an easy-going movie that you can sit all the way through. Other than the landmark finale that remains among the most memorable shots on film, not a whole lot can be said. This is, pure and simple, great entertainment thanks to a bright mind who overcame tough obstacles in hitting a big time movie career.\n\n***The mention of \"B-movie\" in this message can be exploited. Noteworthy in the film is Troma's founder and creator of THE TOXIC AVENGER Lloyd Kaufman, who took part in casting as a \"drunk\", and also serving as a pre-production supervisor. He also appeared (and presented) in John Avildsen's earliest directorial effort, CRY UNCLE. Long before ROCKY, Avildsen was known for making a couple of low budget films. It is assumed that he and Kaufman are true buddies in the movie-making business.\n\nDon't be shocked and stunned at the original ROCKY being the greatest B-movie to take home the greatest honors in the world, particularly the Oscars!"

According to most people, Rocky's story is simultaneously with Sly's life and this makes movie more special. That's why, reading the background of filming process is highly recommended before watching Rocky.\n\nAs most sport movies, the message of the movie is that you should do your best regardless the circumstances. When Rocky is watched now, it has some cliches. However, these cliches do not disturb audience's pleasure. Intercalarily, Rocky can be considered as a clicheless movie according to a film made in 1976. Despite its all filming inexperiences and its all shooting mistakes, Rocky is accepted as a cult for cinema community. Since, these inexperiences and mistakes contribute involuntarily to movie's effort to reflect Rocky's \"underdog\" life.\n\nWhen all features of the Rocky are considered as a whole, it can be seen that Rocky is not only a sport movie. It is a movie could change most people's world view. It gives people a way of thinking and teaches them life's dark and painful side. It shows them, the important thing is not to reach the top, but to fight on this way. While doing these all, it achieves to get audience into different feelings. Therefore, Rocky is more than a sport movie. It is a cult gains people a world view and deserves its score absolutely."

Pretty self-explanatory plot. Most sports underdog movies that have come along since have attempted to imitate the training montages and the utter hopelessness and humiliation that Rocky feels at certain low points in the plot. Imitated, but never mastered quite as well as the original, in my opinion. Talia Shire also does great in her role as Adrian.\n\nThis movie has it all. Sports fans will like it. Film buffs will like it. The general audience will like it. \"Rocky\" can be placed among some of the seminal classics like \"Star Wars\" and \"The Wizard of Oz\" as the type of movie that pretty much anybody can enjoy."

        "review_detailed_main": "American cinema in the 1970s was marked by the new generation of filmmakers' bombshell of originality, liveliness, sexuality and a fervor for the artistic importance of film itself, with a pervading emphasis on realism, subversive political themes and sexual candor. But what won Best Picture in the year of Taxi Driver, Network and All the President's Men---the legendary arguable masterpieces of three of contemporary cinema's finest directors---is this paint-by-numbers inspirational sports flick. Stallone's screenplay is the most wholesome 1930s Hollywood fantasy. It's the tale of Rocky and his girl Adrian, when he, because of conditions too irrational to go into, is given the chance to fight the world heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed, fashioned after Muhammad Ali so sketchily as to be a practically senseless misuse of character. It's not sufficient enough to even be defamation, but by making the Ali-like fighter such a garish fool, the film treads regions of undeveloped racism that might not be all that undeveloped.\n\nThere are intermittent twinklings that the film may be condescending to the subordinate end of the proletarian attitude, as much if not more than the characters who continue putting Rocky down, like Gazzo's bodyguard and the (black) boxer who taunts Rocky after usurping his locker. Then again, Avildsen is known for creating such indistinctness with films he made before such as Joe---which dealt with what mainstream film hadn't yet dared about the neutral depiction of overt racists, junkies and gritty urban living---and the great Save the Tiger, which punctured stereotypes and sought longingly and urgently for answers to the seeming moral predicaments of modern times. Rocky is a devolution of that thread.\n\nHowever, there are some extremely fine actors in other supporting parts. Burt Young is convincing as Rocky's best friend, a drunk jerk, as is a both deservedly Oscar-nominated and very underused Burgess Meredith as Rocky's antiquated trainer. It's actually Shire who comes off the best, Coppola's sister and Connie in his Godfather saga. She's a genuine actress, truly moving and also droll as a budding bachelorette who comes behind schedule to sexual life. She's so effective, actually, that she almost adds credence to Stallone's performance, which is frankly way too goofy. (I keep getting the impulse to mock him out loud in that mongoloid exaggeration of Italian-American brute brogue.) So Rocky, by day, is a petty debt collector for a neighborhood loan shark played by Joe Spinell. Rocky's the kind of character who evinces his genuine compassion by thinking twice about breaking a stakeholder's thumb. At night, as we all by now very well know, chases a substandard boxing career in rundown sporting rings. But consider when Shire sits, crying and furrowed, in a corner of her small bedroom. Her brother has wrecked the living room with a baseball bat. Rocky, the guy she has become smitten by, enters. She timidly asks him if he wants a roommate. \"Absolutely,\" he says, which is precisely what he should say, and how he should say it, and why Rocky is such an involving movie despite its otherwise ultimately stale framework."

That shot during the training montage where he's running along the harbour and overtakes the giant boat is one of those. The music would be another. So would Sylvester Stallone's natural charm, and the loveable character he portrayed.\n\nThere are things that could be done better. I think the sound mixing is rough and it's hard to understand a good deal of dialogue (maybe an intentional choice, but it sometimes frustrates). Things take a little while to get going, we don't get to see Apollo fight before the finale (meaning his much hyped fighting ability is told but now shown), and also... Mickey doesn't really do much at all? I think Burgess Meredith gives a good performance, but I don't know what Rocky needed him for, and almost get the sense he took him on board as a trainer out of pity.\n\nStill, it's a very good, very heartwarming movie, and a deserved classic. I may also be a tiny bit salty that it beat the much more intense, much more memorable (for me at least) Taxi Driver at the Oscars in 1976, but it's better than a fair few other Best Picture winners I suppose.\n\nHaven't seen any sequels except the first two Creed's (the first of which is especially good), and so am keen to watch the other entries in the series soon."

No matter how you look at it, the 70s was the greatest time for American cinema. Scorsese, Coppola, Lumet. Some of the fiercest battles were won in the Academy awards. And it was an exciting time for moviegoers.\n\nWhile Rocky may get a bad rap for beating out some of these American classics for the prize, the fact remains it still is a powerful, inspirational film about a man's dreams to be the best no matter what obstacles lie in is his way.\n\nThe question is does it still hold up after over 30 years? The character of Rocky is one of the most memorable film characters ever and has and established Stallone as a serious filmmaker. Many of the sequences have been engraved in film and popular culture namely the training sessions, meat boxing and the final battle and closing scenes. For fans, these scenes continue to cause great emotional instability no matter how hackneyed and clich\u00e9d they have become today. And this is one is one of \"the greatest underdog stories ever told.\"\n\nStallone carries the film for it's duration - no other actor probably could have played Rocky. The character is well developed by Stallone who wrote the screenplay and was Oscar nominated for both his acting and writing. Stallone's mannerisms, raw, dopey acting style fit the character like a glove. The writing was poetic, heartfelt and honest but I did feel that there were some pacing issues and where the film lagged a bit. You could argue that Stallone merely played himself but he did a good job overall.\n\nThe other strength of the film was the directing for which it won an Oscar. It sets up the Rocky's neighbourhood well, the missed opportunities, the darkness and lost hope. The shades of a dream wanting to be borne into light. The pacing was unusually sombre, quiet and patient for a orthodox story which ultimately worked in favour for the director.\n\nBut I just didn't connect with this film. I thought the story was too simple and clich\u00e9d (in light of watching this 30 years after it's release and in hindsight of more recent boxing films) and there were some dead moments. I would have liked to see more about the fight and less about Rocky's soap operatic antics with his girlfriend and family. In the end I felt it too melodramatic for me add to that the (I can't help it) overdone music and story.\n\nPlus it is impossible not to think about the other American films around this era that have been lasted longer and more potently as a comment on American life and the dream. All the President's Men, Taxi Driver, Network and Raging Bull. All these films have something to say have hopes, dreams, and ideals. While Rocky has captured the hearts of the viewers, it's contemporaries remain timeless and more perceptive in today's world."

His choices were right.\n\nBeginning from the script, to the actors he chose, to the music (I'm only going to say stairwell, because who ever saw the movie, can't deny the power of that scene ... and the music that played an integral part for it to work). Everything fits like a glove ... (no) pun intended.\n\nAnd while it seems so simple, it actually isn't. Ask \"Ali\" (the movie) or \"Cinderella Man\". Both with big star players, both \"Box movies\", but both didn't succeed (at least commercially).

        "review_title": "The Cinderella Film",
        "review_detailed_main": "Sylvester Stallone had a dream and it was to get this film made about an enduring character he created, one of the most enduring in the history of cinema. In true Cinderella Man style Rocky guaranteed him a career and screen immortality. A whole lot like the protagonist ROcky Balboa in the film.\n\nThere was an Irish equivalent of Rocky during the early Sixties in real life, a boxer named Tom McNeeley from South Boston, just as Rocky Balboa is from South Philadelphia. McNeeley was a barely ranked contender, ranked in fact at all just to give him some kind of credence as an opponent for Floyd Patterson. McNeeley fought Patterson in Boston for the local gate attraction. Needless to say his showing against Floyd wasn't quite as good as what Rocky did against Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed, showboating heavyweight champion in the style of Muhammed Ali.\n\nAnd that's what happens to Rocky. Stallone is a local club fighter who also works as a part time enforcer for the loan sharks, but his heart isn't really into it. His heart is torn actually between boxing and his love for Talia Shire, the plain Jane sister of his friend Burt Young.\n\nWhen opportunity comes you have to take it. For some reason a scheduled match between Weathers and another contender for the championship falls through. Several other name contenders aren't available, so it comes down to Rocky Balboa being given a once in lifetime chance in a bout to be held in his native Philadelphia like McNeeley's was in real life.\n\nRocky was the Cinderella story of the Oscars that year, it won for Best Picture, Best Director for John G. Avildsen, and Best Film Editing. Sly Stallone was nominated for Best Actor and Original Screenplay. He lost however to Peter Finch for Network. Burgess Meredith as Rocky's cornerman and gym owner and Carl Weathers were nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but both lost to Jason Robards, Jr. for All the President's Men.\n\nMy favorite in the film was Talia Shire, she is really touching as the Thirty something unmarried plain girl who grabs a last chance for love with Rocky. The role is so different from Connie Corleone in any of the three Godfather films. Sadly Talia lost to Beatrice Straight as William Holden's wife in Network.\n\nJohn Avildsen winning for Best Director is great though I think the film is so much Stallone's own creation, he should have won for Original Screenplay. Avildsen never directed anything as good as Rocky before or since. In fact he directed seven years later one of my all time favorite trash films, A Night In Heaven.\n\nRocky is the great Cinderella movie of all time, the creation of its leading character who put enough of his heart into this film and gained a career for himself. None of the succeeding Rocky films came anywhere near this one for quality. And the story itself was pure Cinderella. How paradoxical and how great."

        "review_detailed_main": "Stallone is just perfect as Rocky, a \"bum\" who gets a shot at the Heavyweight title in Boxing.\n\nWhat works perfectly here is the era in which this film was made. I seriously doubt that had this movie been made a decade later it would be half as charming. It's got that glorious 70's trashy style film-making and setting which made films like Midnight Cowboy or even Five Easy Pieces so appealing to begin with. The characters here feel real and authentic, and most of all, completely human. Nothing spectacular about them, more or less lowlifes who wouldn't arouse any interest in other people than social workers perhaps.\n\nThe script by Stallone is exceptionally good and completely deserved the Oscar. Rocky is a treasure of a character and Stallone plays him to perfection, really should have picked up an Oscar for that as well. This is basically a fairytale story in a different setting and almost feels very real."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Rocky\" is one of those quintessential \"right place/right time\" movies. Movie-going America, beleaguered by bleak and cynical tales of everything their country was doing wrong, were ready for this underdog success story, which illustrates that living in America ain't so bad after all.\n\nBut come on. If people were being honest, they would admit that \"Rocky\" just doesn't hold up very well now. Director John G. Avildsen's only notable film since this one was \"The Karate Kid\" in 1984, so that tells you something right there. There's nothing wrong with loving \"Rocky\" for the inspirational fairy tale that it is, but the fact that it looks gritty and real like all of the other serious socially-themed films from the same time period has allowed it to join them on the list of important cinematic achievements so abundant in the 1970s, and it's just not an important film.\n\nWith, of course, Sylvester Stallone in a star-making performance, one that he's been trying to recapture ever since, and Talia Shire, fresh off the \"Godfather\" movies and ready to have a leading part of her own. But the scene stealer in this film is Burgess Meredith, who plays Rocky's coach and agent like a cranky pirate.\n\nGrade: B"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is easily the best sport movie ever made but the movie is way more than a boxing movie. It's also one of the best drama-movies I have ever seen.\n\nReason why \"Rocky\" is a classic is of Sylvester Stallone. Believe it or not, he really deserved that Oscar nomination for best actor. Why? Because he simply IS Rocky. He plays the character so well with so much passion that he can be regarded as one of the best and most memorable movie characters in movie history. The movie is filled with strong solid character, I especially love how the unusual friendship between Rocky and Paulie is portrayed. Talia Shire is also very impressive as shy young woman. The love-story between her and Rocky is done very well and in a believable way.\n\nThe movie its main focus is on the drama and only the last 30 minutes of the movie really focuses on the boxing. So really, you don't have to be a boxing fan to like this movie, this movie should be enjoyable and unforgettable for everybody. The story is told in a good slow pace and it pays attention to the character's emotions and struggles. The story of 'underdog' has been much copied ever since in many movies and in many different variations but nothing has ever came close to \"Rocky\"'s level.\n\nThe music by Bill Conti is also of course unforgettable and is also something that brings the movie to the next level.\n\nEven though the movie is mainly a drama, the best scene's are still the boxing sequence's. They are filmed very well and are very spectacular to watch time after time. You'll simply never get tired of those scene's!\n\nIn my opinion a real classic!\n\n10/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

Stallone would base yet another of his ROCKY movies (III) on the shenanigans of Ali (against giant Japanese professional wrestler Antonio Inoki) and Wepner (versus Andre the Giant). Stallone's debt to both Ali and Wepner is something that the star only begrudgingly admits (though it's crystal clear to anyone with at least one working eye). (As far as the Apples and Oranges argument about Boxing versus Wrestling goes, one wonders why it's always a boxer trying to wrestle and never the other way around...)"

Some of it has aged quite a bit, though, and the final bout isn't necessarily one of the piece's highlights, even if it certainly works rather well. This isn't a big issue considering that the flick isn't really about the climactic match anyway, but the fact that some of the preceding film is a bit slow and that some of Stallone's dialogue is genuinely hard to decipher is more of a problem. Still, it works well as a grounded character study and, like its hero, it has a lot of heart. 7/10."

He fits Rocky Balboa character. Also he has made a good job as a writer too. He created a few great supporting characters like Creed and Adrian. Apollo Creed reminds me Muhammed Ali.

But he gets a supremely rare chance to fight the heavy-weight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers , real life boxer Ken Norton was offered the role , but because he was 230 pounds, it was felt he would dwarf Stallone too much, and a smaller man was sought) in a bout in which he strives to go the distance for his self-respect . Rocky attempts to prove himself and his girlfriend (Talia Shire , Carrie Snodgress was originally offered the role o but dropped out due to a disagreement about money , Susan Sarandon also auditioned) , friend (Burt Young , Stallone had originally wanted Harvey Keitel for the role) and trainer (Burguess Meredith who steals the show as an old coach , though the character was initially offered to Lee Strasberg) .\n\nThis enjoyable predictable entertainment displays splendidly various elements as drama , emotion and spectacular boxing . This soaper on the ring is developed in gentleness , dignity and feel-good style . Magnificent Stallone as a tough boxer , prior to shooting, Sylvester trained for six months with legendary fight-trainer Jimmy Gambina, who was also the film's technical adviser ; during this period, Stallone also studied every available piece of footage of boxers Rocky Marciano and Ezzard Charles. Great training montage and spectacular and climatic final bout . Writer-actor Stallone first entry is surprisingly entertaining and packs good feeling . Although Stallone famously wrote the first draft of the script in 3 days, it went through nine sizable rewrites before it was purchased by Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartof ; originally, Stallone's much darker script depicted Mickey/Burgess Meredith as a bitter old racist, and the film ended with Rocky throwing the fight after realizing he did not want to be part of the professional boxing world . Originally the filmmakers wanted several former heavyweight champions to appear at the beginning of the fight between Rocky and Apollo ; they put out a call for all former champions to show, but on the day of the shoot only Joe Frazier turned up ; the filmmakers thought it worked well however, because Frasier is a resident of Philadelphia, which was where the movie was shot and took place . Some immortal scenes include the iconic shot of Rocky running up the steps of Philadelphia Art Museum came about because of Steadicam inventor Garrett Brown was from Philadelphia . Most of the scenes of Rocky jogging through Philadelphia were shot guerrilla-style, with no permits, no equipment and no extras . Good production design , though for the championship fight, the filmmakers had trouble getting extras to fill the arena because it was a low-budget film that was not yet known to anyone . Stock footage of crowds was used to help this problem, but empty seats are still visible in some shots . Emotive as well as unforgettable musical score by Bill Conti and atmospheric cinematography by James Crabe . The motion picture was rightly financed by the producers of complete saga , Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler and compellingly directed by John G Avildsen , being shot in 28 days. The picture achieved big success as critical as public and in 2007, the American Film Institute ranked this as the #57 Greatest Movie of All Time and ranked #2 on the list of the 10 greatest films in the genre \"Sports\" in June 2008.\n\nFollowed by various sequels that work at usual manner, fitting appropriately to franchise , even though we know the plot the films work, continuing the 'formula Rocky'\u00a8, such as \u00a8Rocky II\u00a8 was co-starred by Carl Weathers , in which Balboa returns to take on Apollo Creed ; \u00a8Rocky III\u00a8 after being dethroned by obnoxious , corpulent Mr T from A Team ; \u00a8Rocky IV\u00a8 against a massive Russian boxer played by Dolph Lundgren ; \u00a8Rocky 5\u00a8with Tommy Morrison and Sage Stallone , real-life son plays Rocky Jr. and finally \u00a8Rocky Balboa\u00a8 proving his estranged young son Milo Ventiglimia who still can fight ."

The scenes with Adrian's brother are boring and unnecessary, and he's crazy. The first half of the movie is rocky trying to hook up with Adrian, then about 2/3 in he actually focuses on boxing.

To know that this production was not only in on film, but also in real life, a \"win or lose\" project for the then unknown Sylvester Stallone only makes this film more lovable. It tells the story of a unknown prize fighter who doesn't really have a life worth envying. Suddenly he gets his big chance when the world champion seeks a new challenger, as the challenger he had has to bail out, due to an injury. Rocky goes for it, but in the end he knows he's not in the same league as the champ. The true victory is Rocky's new gains self respect and love for his girlfriend Adrian. This film has a really cool 70's vibe and for me the locations use (Philadelphia) fit the film perfect. It was filmed during winter 1976 and that's something you can actually see. The true realism and great acting performances (plus the unforgettable soundtrack) makes this a film worthwhile. A must see definitely!! My favourite scene is still the one where Rocky goes out for his first morning run. He gets up at 4 A.M. and sets out into the cold, frozen streets of morning hour Philadelphia. The mood, music and the winterish landscape of a city frozen up are brought to the screen with such a transparant touch.. It still chi lls my skin everytime I watch it! If you haven't seen this one, shame, shame shame!!! Go out and rent or (even better) buy the DVD! One of the best American films of the 1970's (and that's something no one can deny)!"

Sadly, it always leaves me unmoved and a little bored.\n\nMy main problem with Rocky is that for a near 2-hour film about boxing, there is barely 15 minutes worth of actual fighting. The story crawls slowly and agonisingly towards the main event and then most of it is cut out and what we do see is unrealistic and completely devoid of strategy. The actual boxing choreography is a joke; there's no footwork, defence, feinting, blocking, jabbing, head or body movements. I am no boxing expert but based on the beatings he took, I'm pretty sure Rocky would have literally died had this fight been real.\n\nThe majority of the movie seems to involve Balboa engaging in rambled conversations, few of which help move the plot forward. Stallone is not strong enough as an actor and Balboa not interesting enough as a character to warrant this. Paulie is quite cliched and forgettable in this movie (although he does develop slowly through the series) and Mickey is a bit forced and melodramatic. Adrian is the only character with any real character development and Talia Shire's performance is comfortably the highlight of this movie.\n\nI understand why people love this film so much but for me it is definitely a case of style over substance."

He lives in the most bombed-out part of Philly, making a living by collecting money for loan sharks. In one scene, he breaks some eggs into a glass and drinks them (wouldn't that be unhealthy? salmonella and cholesterol?). His two main acquaintances are hubby Adrian (Talia Shire) and her loser brother Paulie (Burt Young). But the possibility of going up against a famous boxer gives him the strength that he has always sought. In what is probably the movie's most famous scene, Rocky triumphantly runs up to a monument while the theme song \"Gonna Fly Now\" is playing. Not only did \"Rocky\" fly into cinematic history, but won Best Picture and some other Oscars. It doesn't matter whether or not Rocky wins the fight; the point is how he now has the chance to make something of himself.\n\nAnd yes, my orthodontist has in his office an outline of Sylvester Stallone's body filled with pages from the \"Rocky\" script."

        "review_title": "A triumph of self-pitying losers",
        "review_detailed_main": "I'm well aware of the story behind the creation of Rocky, especially the fact that Stallone had a very hard time to draw the studios' attention to the screenplay which was his vision of a chance to get out of the obscurity his career and himself were in at that time. So if we were to look at Rocky as a defining moment for the Stallone's star then yeah, it's a pretty important film. However, i don't think that a film's merits should be defined by whose career it helped boost. And, as a separate cinematographic product, Rocky is not just undeserving to be among the best films of all times, it's plain average.\n\nThe whole fiber of the film oozes hopelessness and despair. And maybe Philadelphia of the 70's was indeed a grim place to live in. But the main reason for setting up a story in such a depressing environment is to allude the life of Rocky Balboa and those surrounding him to some kind of a Cinderella story and make us root for the underdog. And it might have even worked if Rocky was even slightly intriguing and charismatic.\n\nInstead, Stallone's script does its best to avert the audience from Rocky. The first half of the film is basically a showcase of what a bum (if not a true imbecile) Rocky is. Unable to talk like a human being, instead mumbling some deranged nonsense, Rocky is more like Frankenstein than Cinderella, roaming around the murky streets of the Philadelphia slums, devoid of any idea how to live his life today or what to do with it tomorrow. The only way to make him look less of a creep was to give him pet turtles and an affection for an equally socially and emotionally disabled woman working in a store nearby, which might be sentimental enough to work for some, but feels unbelievably forced and corny to me.\n\nBut for the Cinderella story to work, Rocky had to receive an invitation to a ball. A title boxing fight in his case. Which happens late enough to get bored by Balboa's constant downer's attitude (how's that for an example: \"You gotta be a moron to wanna be a fighter, you know what I mean? It's a racket where you're almost guaranteed to end up a bum.\"). But, luckily, still early enough to give the film some room to capitalize on that change. Because when Rocky finally shuts it and starts doing something useful, he becomes watchable at last. Even inspiring for some.\n\nThe end of this fairy tale is as predictable as it's gracious for the protagonist. It's by no means realistic, but i guess Stallone just didn't have enough star fever to write a better ending for his character. Still, the fact that the film ends rather abruptly is probably a sign that the author had no idea what to do next other than to call a woman to the rescue. Unfortunately, the impression that the whole film leaves is exactly the same: unaware of its goals, hardly knowing what to do, simply trying to go the distance because... well, because there's no much choice otherwise. Apparently, the audience loved that blind weary spirit back in the day, but now it looks like the success of Rocky and the career of Stallone itself were nothing but freak luck."

I don't have any interest in boxing, so the film's content or Rocky's struggle didn't really resonate with me, as well as it could have done. I didn't particularly like Stallone's portrayal of Rocky either. Between his mumbling and his shouting, I couldn't understand anything that he was saying. This didn't really help with me empathising with the character. Although all credit to the set-designers. Rocky's apartment did look like a horrible place to live with the peeling wallpaper.\n\nJust thank God, Burgess Meredith was in it.\n\nRead my full review for more: http://goo.gl/mM9IxQ"

        "review_detailed_main": "Rocky is a film telling the story of an amateur boxer Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) who worked as a debt collector for a loan shark in 1970s Philadelphia. This is a good depiction of the typical American rags to riches story. Rocky develops feelings and pursues a pet shop worker by the name of Adrian (Talia Shire) and we watch their relationship grow as the movie progresses. Rocky is given a shot at the title of world heavyweight champion when the reigning heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) challenges him to a fight. The purpose of the fight was to give an unknown boxer a shot against the champion. Rocky accepts the challenge and begins his famous training regime leading up to the legendary running up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The much anticipated boxing match takes place on New Year's Day in an arena full of spectators. The fight is long and very intense lasting the entire 15 rounds, and both boxers are pretty badly beaten up. Once the fight ends, everyone pretty much goes wild as this was one of the most entertaining fights in history. The winner is finally announced with Creed named the winner by virtue of a split decision.\n\nAs stated earlier, the theme for Rocky is the typical American Dream story of rags to riches or maybe even just a well told success story. Rocky also can be seen as a love story in a way. We get to watch the relationship between Rocky and Adrian blossom and grow throughout the movie. Rocky set the benchmark for similar movies later on that used the same theme and even plot. A good movie that comes to mind with a similar theme to Rocky is Cinderella Man (2005). Russell Crowe's character in that movie (James Braddock) is struggling to make ends meet and is eventually given a shot at the title in fight against Max Baer.\n\nThere are several film techniques that are used throughout Rocky that truly make the movie unforgettable. I was use the last few scenes of the boxing match against Apollo Creed as an example. The angles are very close to show the intensity of strength of the punches thrown between the two fighters. There are also very quick transitions between frames to capture the action of the fight and emotion. The sound effects were amazing as well. There is the visible sounds of the punches being thrown and the grunts and moans of the fighters. While at the same time, we also hear the invisible sounds of the crowd cheering and the bell ringing in the background. The great use of sound effects really made it seem as if you were actually at the boxing match.\n\nOverall I think this was a very good movie and was definitely worthy the Academy Award it received. This movie truly had me rooting for the main character (and also Adrian). I was disappointed when he didn't win the fight."

What people don't tell you is just how good this movie is at feeling as raw as the eggs Rocky downs in one go.\n\nLeisurely and deliberately unlovely as we drag ourselves through the quiet, cramped, noisome world of the underprivileged with the glimpse of glory dangled in front of us.\n\nIt's not really conventional storytelling with intrigue and an unexpected resolve; think of it more like a piece of fake history where the fascination is baring witness to the tiny episodes that the athlete has to go through as they struggle through the pain of awkward social life, poverty and keeping up an exorcise regime.\n\nSeriously, it is really awkward when Rocky tries to court the beautiful Adrien but that's the point. It's very to the point which is another thing about this movie; things just sort of happen without putting too fine a point on anything.\n\nOn that note, sometimes characters do just start yelling sitcom style but reconciliation is (mostly) imminent.\n\nI cannot not love the montage and the music and the fight choreography to satisfy my fixation of the underdog physically holding his own against the champion but as Stallone always reminds us: it's about the journey."

Rocky is the story of a million to one shot underdog given a chance of lifetime and a shot at something more, and an opportunity to find worth and respect.\n\nThe films beautifully unfolds the arc of a man who ultimately finds his worth and finds someone worthy to fight for, love for and live for. Rocky finds the balance between the brutality of boxing and the beauty of love and romance.\n\nFeaturing young actor/writer Sylvester Stallone in his first and perhaps signature role. Sylvester Stallone captures the heart of Rocky Balboa, a two bit club fighter just existing. Finding his only passion being that of his best friend Paulie's (Burt Young) shy sister, Adrian, who works at the corner pet store. The romance between Rocky and Adrian blossoms as the shy intellectual (Adrian) finds value and worth in the brash boxer (Rocky).\n\nWe find the current World Heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed played masterfully by first time actor (former NFL Linebacker) Carl Weathers. Creed is unable to locate a worthy opponent for his November championship fight. That is until Rocky is pulled from obscurity and given the change of a lifetime.The film also introduces us to Rocky's somewhat bitter, angry, and antagonistic manager played flawlessly by Academy Award Nominee, and veteran stage and screen actor, Burgess Meredith.\n\nRocky is more than just a simply film about boxing. It is a true love story. It is a movie about finding one's worth, going the distance, finding love and never giving up. This is as close to a perfect film as you will ever find."

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw this during it's initial theatrical release and I've seen it several times over the years as well as just recently for the first time in along time. It holds up well and is a remarkable film in many ways. It's creation and success is as improbable as it's story. An unknown struggling actor with tough guy looks writes a screenplay about a struggling boxing club fighter who is somehow given a chance to make the most improbable leap imaginable; a shot at the heavyweight championship of the world. Syvester Stallone wrote the story after seeing a fight between Muhammad Ali and Chuck Wepner. Wepner was a club boxer known as \"The Bayonne Bleeder\" who worked as a liquor salesman to make a living. In a boxing stunt to give an unknown a chance with a champion, a fight was arranged between he an Ali. The fight was expected to be a brief one with Ali hardly working up a sweat but Wepner went the full 15 round distance and even knocked Ali down once in the fight. In Rocky Stallone plays the title role of a club fighter who works as a collection enforcer for a loan shark to make a living. He's a sensitive guy behind his tough exterior and has a crush on the mousy pet shop sales girl Adrian played by Talia Shire. Burt Young is Paulie, her brother. Burgess Meredeth is Mickey, the owner of the gym where Rocky fights. Carl Weathers is Apollo Creed the Champ who wants to give an unknown from the streets a chance to fight him. Rocky gets selected for the chance and Mickey trains him for the match. Meredeth was the best known of the cast at the time of the film. Shire was known for her recent supporting roles in The Godfather I and II but only for those roles and here is an opportunity to break from the Godfather. Stallone, Young, Weathers and the rest of the cast were relative unknowns. Shot on a small budget and in a 30 day shoot schedule it would make 50 times what it cost to make it during it's initial North American theatrical release and go on to be nominated for an incredible 10 Academy Awards, winning two of the biggest in Best Picture and Best Director and a third for Best Film Editing. John Alvidson who had some critical success with Joe and Save the tiger get an Oscar for his direction. Scott Conrad and Richard Halsey early in their careers get an Oscar for their editing. James Crabbe is the cinematographer. Among the Academy Award nominations Rocky beat out a strong field that included Network, Taxi Driver and All the President's Men for Best Picutre. Stallone in his two nominations for Best Actor and Original Screenplay lost out to film veterans Peter Finch in Network and Paddy Chayefsky's Network screenplay. Young and Meredith may have canceled each other out with two of the five nominations for Best Supporting Actor and Jason Robards won the Oscar for All the President's Men in a strong field of nominees that also included Luarence Olivier and Ned Beatty. Meredith should have won the Oscar for his memorable performance. Shire lost out to Faye Dunaway in Network for Best Actress. This film of course went on to launch a franchise of Rocky films for Stallone but I would have preferred no sequels to this story. Just let it stand as it is as the little story that could. This is a very likable film filled with memorable scenes and duologue and shot on location in Philadelphia with a gritty look. It's worth a look if you've never seen it and worth a revisit if it's been awhile since you've seen it last. I would give it a 9.0 out of 10."

Then something unexpected happened. In the spring of 1975, Stallone watched the heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali fighting Chuck Wepner on TV. Of course, the challenger didn't stand a chance, but despite that, Wepner managed to stay on his feet right into the final round. Something that gave Sylvester Stallone a great idea.\n\nThree days later, Stallone had finished the first draft of what would become \"Rocky\". A story about a boxing journeyman who gets the chance of a lifetime. Unfortunately, getting the film produced proved to be much harder than writing its screenplay. And things got even trickier when Stallone insisted on playing the main part himself. After lengthy negotiations, however, United Artists agreed to his demands. Sylvester Stallone would work for a minuscule wage but was instead promised a percent of the film's (unlikely) net profit.\n\nUnited Artists decided to open \"Rocky\" in a few, select theaters for maximum reaction. The studio's management then decided to send the film's leading man on an extensive promotion tour. For weeks Sylvester Stallone travelled the country, telling the assembled press how he had refused to sell his script unless he himself got to play the lead. A rags-to-riches story the media simply loved.\n\nThe very idea that a low-budget production like \"Rocky\" would stand a chance at the Academy Awards seemed preposterous. Besides, future classics like \"All the President's Men\", \"Network\" and \"Taxi Driver\" were in the competition that year. But the incredible happened. As a true underdog, \"Rocky\" took home the Best Picture Oscar. The victory also meant that Sylvester Stallone, a former Tinseltown bit player, was on his way of becoming a bona-fide megastar."

His entire life is filled with interesting people that means a lot to him. Yet, when it comes to hard times, Rocky is the only person who can see it all. And right now, he is given a chance to fight at the 200th anniversary of the nation.\n\nIn the beginning of the movie, Rocky Balboa, (Sylvester Stallone), is a down and out boxer who is just finishing up his last fight. He's poor and his only other occupation that he has other than a boxer is a collector for a loan shark. Rocky also has friends that seem to challenge him in his everyday life. His friend, Paulie, (Burt Young), work for a meat processing place and even he has to deal with his problems. One of those problems is Adrian, (Talia Shire), a shy woman who can't stand living with him because of his drunkenness. Meanwhile, Apollo Creed, (Carl Weathers), is looking for a competitor to fight for the nation's biggest birthday. His ultimate choice is, of course, Rocky. Creed thinks that Balboa is the perfect fighter. In order for Rocky to fight against Creed, he seeks the help of his gym manager, Mickey, (Burgess Meredith), an angry and tough man who is willing to train Rocky for the big fight.\n\nThe movie is filled with a lot of great screen performances. The one aspect that strike me the most was Sylvester Stallone. This is a great performance from him and the first of many. One thing that I like about Stallone is the way that he writes Rocky and all of the other characters' dialogue. He tries to create a likable person out of himself and with that writing, we can actually see ourselves being with these people. Rocky Balboa is a wonderful character. He has a heart of gold. In addition, there is a very nice and sweet love story between Rocky and Adrian that adds flavor to the movie. Burt Young and Burgess Meredith also make the movie work because their characters to me, were one of the reasons why Rocky's world is so upset and angry. It's not the characters' fault. It's the way their world is affected by America's problems. These characters are not happy living in this competitive world of fighting over what they want or what they can get. Rocky isn't about the central character. It is more about people rather than the main character.\n\nThe famous scene in which Rocky runs up the stairs while \"Gonna Fly Now\" plays in the background is perhaps the most powerful and most inspirational scenes in movie history. In my opinion, whenever I see a sports movie, I think of them as being inspirational. I always find that the main character is always pushing his way through tough times. The final fight scene in the movie between Rocky and Apollo is the second best scene in the movie because by the end, you feel as though your emotions are drained. By that time, the audience who seen this movie in the movie theater were probably cheering with joy and crying with emotion. Inside, I was cheering and devastated with joy.\n\nIt's a shame that Rocky is the only great movie that Stallone has written and starred in. Because of that, Stallone fell into a losing streak with very bad films and sometimes embarrassing. This movie proves that Stallone is perfect for the role. He knows what comes out of Rocky Balboa. He knows that people will like this character and always stick to him because he is friendly and also, lonely. But above all, this is the movie that made Stallone a star in the first place. It's great to see him land a juicy role in a major motion picture. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 4 stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ah, Rocky. What else is there to talk about that hasn't already been said? The movie that put Sylvester Stallone on the map and won the Oscar for Best Picture back in '77. As a movie goer, I wanted to explore the Rocky films, as I got the Blu-ray collection of the original 6 movies. It was a truly great experience watching these films and made me a fan of the series. But with that being said, how does the original hold up compared to the sequels? Well, the answer may be obvious, but let's just start anyway, shall we?\n\nRocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is a broken boxer, who is looked upon as a \"bum\" because of his habits in the streets of Philadelphia. He is later seen being competed against Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), giving Rock a one to million shot on New Year's Eve 1975. He decides to accept the fight, as well as dealing with his relationship to his friend Paulie's (Burt Young) sister Adrian (Talia Shire), and having his old trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) come to help him prepare for the battle.\n\nOne strong aspect of this movie is how believable the characters are due to its solid casting. Take the title character himself for example; he may seem like some bad cause to the locals, but all he is is just a lonely guy who's hoping something good will happen to him. And even though Stallone may have been repeating words over in his sentences (\"You know\" being a prime example of this), it was in his early times, so it's understandable.\n\nAnother thing this movie has to offer is the score done by Bill Conti and the cinematography (most notably the training scene and the final fight between Balboa and Creed). The music just gets you invested and the camera shots are excellent, like the iconic \"running up the steps\" scene with the amazing \"Gonna Fly Now\" tune. It just makes you so excited it gives you goosebumps each time you see it.\n\nHowever, if there is one thing to criticize here is that it can get rather slow at times. The first act is just Rocky trying to live his normal life. This is even worse when sequels like Rocky III and IV would come along and make the series more enjoyable to watch because of their nonstop action sequences. But that's not to say it ruins the whole movie, in fact by doing so, it makes it feel a lot more subtle in addition to the grainy atmosphere that makes the movie feel so realistic and down-to-earth.\n\nTo many people, Rocky is a film that teaches us that it isn't necessarily winning that matters, but how much you try that counts. Thus, it doesn't feel like your typical sports drama, where the protagonist has to win the game to succeed their goal. Unfortunately, many of the sequels do rely on the goal of winning, which in a way, kills the original's meaning. But if you can get past that, this message is motivational enough to become a timeless piece of advice whenever you're feeling negative about yourself.\n\nWith believable acting, a fantastic soundtrack, memorable characters, well-structured plot, and a great message, the first Rocky movie is really a 1970's classic you wouldn't wanna miss out on. Chances are, though, you've already seen it, but if not, do give it a watch. It is essentially the film a lot of people should see for its realistic morals and how we tend to fail plenty in life and need to learn to get better. The best of the Rocky franchise, and probably Sly Stallone's best next to First Blood, I give this movie an 8.5 out of 10, closer to a 9."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was born in the late 80s and never gave much attention to the Rocky saga. The underdog rags-to-riches story had been used so many times in the 90s; Rocky simply didn't have much appeal. With all the hype about this sixth installment raging around the internet, I finally decided to give this original a shot. On my first viewing, however, it didn't impress me much. I got pretty bored and tired of the insipid lifestyles in a rundown neighborhood that I wasn't paying attention to some of the scenes.\n\nA few days later I came across an article saying that Sly Stallone got drunk for a scene because they could only do one take of it and he didn't want to mess it up. It was during the night before the fight, where Rocky was confiding his fears and ambitions to Adrian. I revisited that scene and watched all the way till the end. This is the time I use the words: It was a knockout. Rocky reminded us what life is all about; taking a shot, and giving it everything you have. I got so pumped up that I watched 2-5 over the next two days, but only the second could come close to rivaling this.\n\nThe low-life characters Stallone created in this depressed environment could relate to just about anyone who has been down and hopeless. There's the life-wasting bum in Rocky, the shy and unconfident Adrian, and Paulie, an outcast of society, among many others. When Rocky receives his shot at the title, its compelling to see the way that people around him change, even his aging trainer Micky. It gave them hope and something to believe in, but ultimately it is down to Rocko to complete the Cinderella act.\n\nIn the end, Rocky not only restores hope to a society where dreams seemed distant and impossible, but earned the ever elusive prize everyone toiled for from the moment they dreamed; self-respect. A wonderful tale for the underdog in all of us."

I got really rape vibes from it, and it is horrible. I am glad she loved him because if not this would have been a horrible rape scene.\n\nI think they are cute couple but the way they get together is so wrong on every level.\n\nBut the pacing is so good you get to feel the Loneliness and feeling of downtrottingness in the beginning of the movie and then in the later half it feels so fulfilling and so meaningful when the good stuff is happening. It is so well put together I understand the pacing and appreciated.\n\nThis is a classic and I now appreciated my self."

        "review_detailed_main": "A crowning achievement that, amongst other accolades, earned the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1976, \"Rocky\" tells the story of Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), a washed-up boxer who serves as a strong-arm for a loan shark by day and fights for cash in dingy clubs by night. When flashy heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) challenges him to fight, Rocky finally has a chance to prove to himself and the world that he is still worthy. With the aid of an aging trainer (Burgess Meredith), a hot-headed but loyal friend (Burt Young) and a mousy pet-store clerk, Adrian (Talia Shire) Rocky goes the distance in a bid at self-redemption.\n\nRocky Balboa's rags-to-riches story echoes that of Sylvester Stallone's professional career. A virtually unknown at the time, Stallone was propelled to superstardom following the film's success at the box office, and got his foot in the door not only as an iconic action hero, but also as a prolific writer/director (he would later go on to direct four out of five \"Rocky\" sequels while writing and starring in all of them). His portrayal of the titular character earned him an Oscar nod, and it's easy to see why. Charismatic and ultimately human as the underdog hero, this is the stuff screen legends are made of.\n\nThe script, written by Stallone himself, is focused more on the everyday life of Balboa and less on the sport itself. A boxing film with very little boxing, \"Rocky\" is more of a character piece where we spend the bulk of the film getting to know and sympathize with our lead so that when the third act kicks in with a rousing montage and a whopper of a fight, you're cheering him on every step of the way. The film is aided by a nostalgic soundtrack and a slight-of-hand by director John G. Avildsen. Avildsen could very well milk the sappiness at hand, but instead, keeps the film feeling raw and real, yet inspiring at the same time.\n\n\"Rocky\" is, in a nutshell, a classic for the ages. It's easily Stallone's finest film and certainly had an immense impact on pop culture. Even if you don't particularly appreciate boxing or any sport for that matter, you'll find it to be a worthy, involving and inspiring underdog tale. \"Rocky\" is a true knock-out, time and time again."

When an injury forces Heavyweight champion Apollo Creed's opponent to miss a much-hyped bicentennial bout, Creed settles on the gimmick of fighting the unknown \"Italian Stallion.\" Though it's often ranked as one of the all-time great sports movies, Rocky isn't really about boxing. It's a fascinating glimpse at people and how they are shaped by circumstance; and how disappointments and aspirations collide. Stallone hasn't delivered as convincing a performance in the three decades since Rocky KO'd the box office competition."

Rocky probably didn't deserve an Oscar over Taxi Driver but that aside Rocky is a rather uplifting drama that works because it concerns itself with the lives of an average joe. Sylvester Stallone is perfect as the average joe who is down to earth, likable even if not too bright. The fight sequence at the end is in particular well staged and it really does get the blood pumping although it's more about the pride of one man and his chance at accomplishment than it ever is about who is really winning. It really is a good movie that not only opened up a genre but also stands alone as one of the most essential boxing movies ever made.\n\n* * * * out of 4-(Excellent)"

What follows is a solid, engaging tale of grit and determination as the champion assumes it's all in the bag and together with his tight-knit team, the challenger is focussed and determined to, at least, go the distance. Sure, Stallone isn't an actor in any traditional sense - he is more of a character, he oozes the part rather then portrays it - and that is what makes this work. You are subsumed into his life, his love, his training and his ambition - almost as the then aspiring Stallone would have been whilst writing and making the film. The action scenes are first class, and the charisma offered by the star, and by trainer Meredith help this stand the test of time well. There are holes in the plot - but they are fairly easy to overlook if you allow the sentiment and strong performances to take and keep hold of your imagination. Great stuff."

Stallone is a terrible actor.\n\n3. Burgess Meredith is channelling a pirate rather than a boxing trainer.\n\n4. Adrian's transformation from absurdly shy pet shop worker to confident, elegant, intelligent girlfriend is ridiculous.\n\n5. There seems to have been a lot of improvisation, which causes most scenes to just ramble on or become unintelligible. The scenes involving Adrian's brother Paulie (Burt Young) are especially bad in this respect.\n\nThere are really only two positives:\n\n1. Carl Weathers plays the arrogant boxing champ perfectly.\n\n2. The final ring scene is gripping. Widely parodied, but still a fantastic piece of cinema.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is a low budget film from the 70s. It's not surprising that the script is poor, the performances are weak and the attitudes are outdated.\n\nBut it does not deserve to retain its status as a classic in 2022."

About an underdog who gets a chance and makes the most of it.\n\nBut as I watch it now, I've come to realize it's in fact a movie about the dangers of brain damage. Every single person in this movie is brain damaged, from the boxers and trainers down to the ice rink janitor, meat hauling half-wit...\n\nThere are a couple of different ways how this shows. The most obvious and most irritating one is the way people communicate. Talking to people is done almost entirely via screaming. Everything turns into a screaming match. It is not only tiresome, but also just plain obnoxious.\n\nMany parts of the movie are good, though. The premise is interesting, the setting dramatic just by itself. The boxing parts seem authentic enough, but there's not enough of it here to satisfy those of us who are only here for it.\n\nAll other things aside, first hour of the movie is skippable, and the rest pretty forgettable. If you took the screaming out, maybe it'd at least be tolerable, but as it is right now, it's not as good as you might remember. An iconic movie to be sure, but not a particularly good one."

Maybe it's because of the boxing scenes. The writing, the directing and the action is top notch. Rocky is fun has a heart and has cool fight scenes.

Barely any of us will truly understand what it is like to be a superhero or a millionaire. Most of us just live in a rat race full of others just like us; Blue collared laborers trying to make it to tommorow.\n\nRocky is just like a lot of us - he's a 30 year old high school dropout who lives on simple things, but his perk is that he likes fighting as a hobby. However, despite the fact he is good at it, He never pursues it into a profession, much to the disdain of his trainer, Mickey. However, one day, the World Heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed realizes all the contenders for his title are either injured, out of shape, or scared of him. However, he has put so much energy into promoting a fight for the american bicentennial birthday, he becomes desperate for a challenger, and hoping for a safe bet, reads Rocky's moniker, the Italian Stallion and wants him to fight, insuring himself an easy victory. However, Rocky sees this as his chance to prove that he's \"Not just another bum from the neighborhood.\"\n\nRocky has actually held up very well in the 40+ years since it's release. It's tough for a movie to age well but Rocky does just fine. The gritty, mean, dirty feel of downtown philadelphia still holds up today, as many of us have seen those types of gritty, broken down neighborhoods in our time.\n\nAs for the acting, Sylvester Stallone knew exactly what he wanted in the Rocky character and he was right to argue for the right to play the role. His co-stars Burt Young, who plays Paulie, Rocky's drunk, lazy, lethargic but loyal friend, is also very spot on in attitude and in looks. Talia Shire, who stars as Rocky's love interest Adrian, plays the fragile, shy virgin girl who over the next few movies, grows stronger, almost as if Rocky's positive attitude rubs off on her over time. Burgess Meredith plays Mickey, a bitter old trainer who feels that Rocky is a waste of time, but thinks he might change his attitude after being given a world title shot. And the World Champion Apollo Creed, played by Carl Weathers, is an almost exact duplicate of the legendary fighter, Muhammad Ali. To put it bluntly, EVERYONE in this film knows exactly who they're trying to be, and they do it flawlessly.\n\nBill Conti's score will forever be timeless in this film. Everyone at some point has to have heard the Rocky theme song, which will forever stand out as a masterpiece. Every song and musical piece conveys emotions extremely well, from the somber & unsure \"Philadelphia morning\" to the powerful, emotional, and motivational \"Going the Distance.\"\n\nIf you haven't seen this film before, you are truly missing out. There's a reason this movie is in the top 250 on the IMDb and odds are it's going to stay there for a very, very long time."

Sylvester Stallone has appeared in more bad movies than good, but Rocky is up there with his best. Rocky is a surprisingly endearing character, he's tough, not too well-spoken and a little dumb, but he's kind-hearted, loves animals and doesn't demand for much outside of not being seen as a bum. The other characters are excellent too: Adrian, Paulie, Mickey and Apollo Creed are blissfully cast and compliment Rocky well, they all have an important place in the story and the movie simply wouldn't work without them. Many think of Stallone as another generic action movie star, but to me, he's not John Rambo, Barney Ross, Judge Dredd or The Toymaker. He's the guy who inadvertently might've saved my life with this excellent film. He is Rocky."

        "review_detailed_main": "I never thought I could take Sylvester Stallone seriously, but I was wrong. Rocky seems to be his most sincere and dedicated role. It's also a role with much more depth than what Stallone usually subjects himself to, which isn't saying a whole lot considering the mindless tripe we see macho-man Stallone in, but I regained a lot of respect for the guy after seeing Rocky. It's one of the greatest underdog stories you'll ever see, following the story of Rocky Balboa, a small time boxer who is given the chance to make it big when all-star boxer Apollo Creed challenges him for a publicity stunt. Rocky takes this chance to become somebody and trains his heart out to beat Creed. It is a story of triumph and solid determination to overcome personal tribulations. It is an inspiring and well made film.\n\nNot only was I impressed with Stallone's ability to act but also write. Rocky has a fantastic script which drives the film and gives it its very natural flow. There is a specific cadence to the dialouge which flows in a very consistent manner and never gets tiresome or dull. On the surface there isn't a whole lot to the story, but the script carries it in a very unique and compelling manner. There are some very memorable lines as well as very memorable scenes that have been ripped off, given homage, and parodied so many times since 1976. Probably the most memorable aspect of the film would be its main theme. The robust trumpeting theme gives the film its powerful and inspiring edge. We've all heard it before, and in the context of the film it is even better to listen to, and has even more of an emotional influence on the listener. Because of this great theme, Rocky amazingly makes the montage work. Montage scenes can be a cheap and easy way out of actually developing characters, but Rocky utilizes its montage scene in the best way possible. It makes for probably the most memorable scene of the film.\n\nThe script in Rocky is magnificent, but it's the characters where the film falls a little short. The character of Rocky Balboa is a very fleshed out and fully realized character. He develops very well and is written with the most care. Unfortunately, the supporting cast can't hold a candle to our protagonist. They aren't nearly as well developed and don't seem to serve nearly as significant of a purpose as Rocky does. The actors themselves do a fine job, but the characters are left a little shallow and slightly two-dimensional. By the end of the film it was safe for me to say that Rocky was the only truly compelling character in the film. This would have been a much bigger issue of Rocky wasn't the main focus of the film. Obviously he is, seeing as the film itself is called Rocky. The characters weren't so underdeveloped that it took away from the film, it was just an unfortunate circumstance that they couldn't be as compelling as the protagonist. It's really not something to complain endlessly about.\n\nRocky is a great film. What it lacks in supporting characters it makes up for in its fantastically deep and compelling protagonist, Rocky Balboa. The script is great and it gives a lot to a story that is relatively simple. The whole film stays exciting and kept my attention from start to finish. It also has an abruptly appropriate ending. It was one of those films where I was surprised when the credits began to role, but in no way disappointed. This is a true gem of the 1970's."

The script of this movie is just beautiful. I liked the way the story becomes character-driven but in a non-boring way. This is not a boxing movie with full of actions and lots of cheesy romance stuff but with an emotional and the thoughts of struggling life.\n\nI was entertained with this movie, although it was predictable.\n\nA must-watch classic film."

I think that Sly was made to play Rocky and the whole movie was done very well. the fight scenes are great the music is great. If you have not seen this movie you should most definitely check this one out. I think that this is probably the best one out of the five that have been made but they are all pretty good. If you want to see a great movie that deals with sports then you should see this one. It is great. I really don't know what else to tell you. It is about an underground boxer who is given a chance to win the heavy weight tile. Burgess Merrideth plays the trainer and does a fantastic job. This movie is strongly recommended. 10 out of 10"

        "review_detailed_main": "What to say about this movie? This is one of the best pictures ever made. Stallone (who also wrote film's screenplay) stars as Rocky Balboa, small time boxer who is living in a small apartment infested with roaches and almost always doesn't have money for that same apartment. He doesn't like his job (working for loan sharks) and (like all of us) dreams of something better. He boxes every night because that is the only constant thing in his life. Also, every single day he tries to impress 'the girl' Adrian (played by Talia Shire), but all his attempts ends unsuccessfully. But, everything will change when heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (played by Carl Weathers) pick him for his next opponent. Apollo is doing that because he knows that Rocky does not have what it takes to beat him. He believes that will easily defend the champion's belt, but he doesn't know that Rocky isn't just some guy, some loser... Oh, no... He is a fighter, he never backs down. This is his only chance to do something with his life, to do something great... And, how many punches he must receive to do this, he will endure till the end. This movie is a 'must-watch' because it tells the story of an outsider who is nothing most of his life and who is never getting a chance to do anything right. But, when he does... Will he use it? Also, you must watch this movie because Stallone give's us one of the best performances in a lifetime, before he went to do some really, really bad action and comedy movies. All in all, this is a 'classic' with some memorable performances (including Burt Young and Burgess Meredith) and story that all generations can understand."

The movie has such a genuine feel - much like \"Good Will Hunting\", it gives a seemingly accurate glimpse into urban blue collar life. The music is also masterfully done... of course the main theme is immediately recognizable (and if it doesn't get your heart rate up, you must be comatose), but the supporting music creates a wonderful ambience... the music Rocky plays on his turntable, the lone french horn theme as he begins his training, the a capella group in the beginning - it's all classic."

Rocky isn't just about some guy getting the shot of a lifetime, it's about the conquering spirit which seems to be inside each and every person, whether they believe it or not. While Rocky engages in somewhat shady practices, he embodies a person that seems to be stuck in time, forever caught up in a moment he can't seem to shake off. While some may dispute this film as the best of 1976, one cannot deny the power and new ground it broke. Instead of being the typical sports-feel-good-movie, it was more about Rocky simply showing the world he can do something more than just be a manual laborer. An awesome film to say the least."

The most important one is that Rocky is prima facie a melodramatic film. And, maybe that I'm too harsh on him, maybe it is the fault of Stallone who did the same mistake on First Blood, but anyway, I don't like it.\n\nAnother problem, although less important than the precedent is that Stalonne isn't a good actor.

He struggles through the club circuit and carves out a living by debt collecting. He may be a bruiser but he's got a heart of gold - which he gives to the shy neigbourhood girl, Adrian.\n\nThrough a twist-of-fate he is given a shot to fight for the Heavy-Weight title of the world. This is Rocky's one chance to prove to himself, and the world, that he's `more than just a bum from the street'.\n\nRocky doesn't feature the machismo that marred the sequels. Stallone weighs in with a performance of weaving strength and sensitivity that will surprise anyone who has ignored his star making turn. The film is funny, exciting and romantic - yep, at its heart lies a love story. This is a heart-felt, inspiring story of a man who finds within himself the ability to go the distance.

There are scenes with contrast and continuity errors, but not enough to be considered bad.\n\nThere wasn't a lot of music in this movie, but when there was it was great, sometimes simple is better.\n\nRocky is the original great boxing movie.

I have nothing negative to say about Rocky as a movie,it's simplistically wonderful and the climax is unforgettable.\n\nI did some detective work online to see about a scene where Rocky talks to a priest before the fight and found that this occoured in Rocky 2, not this one.\n\nAnyhow, 10 stars for \"Rocky\" for the little film that won over the Academy and most of the nation (END)"

Rocky spends his life boxing, collecting bets, hanging around with his annoying best friend Paulie and the shy Adrianna (Paulie's sister). Until one day unexpectedly Rocky will have the opportunity of his life to fight against the champion of the world Apollo Creed.\n\nEach time I watch this movie I cheer for Rocky during the fight against Apollo, as if Rocky were a good friend of mine whom I have known all my life.\n\nHang on Rock."

It really gives us some life lessons too. I'm not just talking about this movie.. i'm talking about the whole hexalogy . This movie is so powerful that it actually make you want to go out there and fight!! for it..just like rocky did...\n\nAnyways , this is a MUST watch movie!! a MUST!! 10/10!!! P.S Great soundtrack!!"

Apollo Creed, the world champion boxer, decides to get an unknown to fight with him in the ring and chooses Rocky. Now Rocky has his chance at the top and he'll work harder than ever to be the champion.\n\nThe great thing about this movie is the fact that it works on so many levels. On the outside, it's a sports movie that will inspire even a king to become greater than he his. On the inside, it's a love story. Rocky and Adrian are one of the most memorable couples in film history and their love seems to be real. It's not just your average sports movie or love story though. This is the finest you'll ever see, even if you don't like boxing or romances.\n\nThe soundtrack probably has the most uplifting song you'll ever hear. \"Gonna Fly Now\" was exactly the kind of song that a movie like this needed. Today, everyone knows it and will hum the tune and even run up steps if they can find any. That's when you know you have a classic on your hands. It will stand the test of time perfectly and will live on as one of the greatest movies ever made.\n\nWith all of those combinations, audiences were amazed with the tale of Rocky Balboa's dream of becoming a champion and his friends who helped him along the way. There's something else that makes this movie work more than anything else before or after it. It was released around the same time when the United States was celebrating its 200th birthday. This is the kind of movie that helped promote the American Dream and showed that our country was still the best. It was quite a way to show patriotism and unity when we needed it.\n\nNowadays, it seems like Rocky is branded as another Stallone movie with so many sequels. Those sequels kind of ruined the reputation that Rocky should have, and we all learned how important a good rep is when we listened to Rocky's speech. So the next time you see this and think its just another excuse to make money, just take the film by itself and then you'll see how well made and well acted this film really is."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Rocky 1\", a film that even after 40 years still manages to express its purity on the highest sentimental scale. A simple movie that still charms the story of the fifth-rate boxer who has never achieved anything relevant in life and one day has the opportunity to prove his worth. Rocky is to be just one more in the millions, but he had the chance, and he grabbed it, it's easy to identify, it's easy to cheer, it's easy to fall completely in love with the movie, which his big top was supposed to be the final fight , which is nothing more than a fight, because its result is irrelevant, Rocky has never been about winning or losing, but about overcoming your limits and achieving your dreams, and this is for every anthology. \"Rocky 1\" has a powerful moral that stirs the American dream, it's not the movie that takes place in the bicentennial year of American independence and its location, the sad, cold and depressing Philadelphia masterfully recorded by director of photography James Crab that manages to incorporate these characteristics that are fundamental to the film. His screenplay is simple but well built, the rocky, heartbroken, silly rocker, Balboa, who can not say no to anyone and is full of lessons and annoyances, and at the same time excites the viewer, his characterization is great and Rocky , as all the characters in the film are trying to prove something, Paulie, Adrian and Mickey, everyone has something to say and everyone develops along with Rocky, his script carries a development and individualities of impeccable characters that gives a unique three-dimensionality to each character . The good direction also helps the great script and the excellent performances, with one of the most vibrant, iconic, unique and exciting soundtrack of the history of the cinema, composed by Bill Conti, it is impossible not to mention its exquisite fit the work, that later would come to being an anthem not only of the franchise, but practically everything that involves boxing, other highlights are the excellent montages and compositions of scenes, costumes and the wonderful makeup, mainly in the final fight that is ahead of its time in terms of makeup and effects . Rocky is pure feeling, Stallone shines in this film as nobody, with script written by him in three days and a beautiful performance, the brucuto that years later would be seen as bad movie signal shows his talent, or not, because Rocky is a mirror of Stallone's life, he does not act, he only lives the character he created himself in the truest way I've ever seen in the movies, \"Rocky I\" was an absolute success, such as Stallone, born along with the powerful franchise which would be created in the future. This film goes beyond many technical or aritic aspects, it is a lesson, a feeling, a more complete demonstration of clarity of ideas, with problems is true, especially in its rhythm and in the narrowing of the third act but even so Rocky enchants the world more than 40 years for its genuinely true and touching simplicity."

        "review_detailed_main": "The most memorable moment in Rocky is the love-scene between and Adrian, both steaming the otherwise fetid room with such clean passion that it surpasses all cardinal passions. Adrian first tries to resists; an act shy but with slow excitement, then acquiesces and lastly is enticed. Rocky slowly allures kisses and then makes love. Both connect emotionally, nullifying each other's weaknesses. The problem is that 'this' is the best scene in the movie, while the 'action' and the 'sport' which should succeed, sag. This kind of movies should be a little unpolished but not indecisive. Rocky made me feel like watching just a sweet romance rather than an action, an underdog story. It more seems like Boxing Practice 101. Rule 1: Gulp down six raw eggs Rule 2: Jog a mile or ten!\n\nI've simply adored Million Dollar Baby for its guts, but mainly its balance of action and drama. The second half is so emotionally straining, I couldn't bear it in the end and cried my eyes out. Rocky could've been such a film had it not stooped to maudlin and pretense. The movie feels and looks more like the 30s, with I don't know, the accent maybe. Or the caricature that the supporting cast is. The opening scene is a normal boxing match with the brawny Stallone facing another unknown face. A small-time boxer and a collector for a 'large-hearted' loan-shark named Gazzo; he lives an ordinary life, loving his pets, trying to woo a painfully shy girl and teaching an androgynous girl lessons to act more womanly. His preference can be known from the conversation as he explains to her how a foul-mouthed girl would be termed nothing but a \"w**re\" in future, and would rather want a lady to be his wife, which he notices in Adrian. This small-timer is suddenly placed on a pedestal when he is given an opportunity to face the flamboyant, insidious, conceited world-champion Apollo Creed, who does this all for a \"good show\".\n\nSylvester does have inkling about what he has to do, but I didn't see any vigor in his eyes. In short, his eyes were dead. In the scene where he vents out his frustration on his to-be trainer for not having faith in him before, he says the line but means them not much. Also, it is difficult to overlook the garbled voice that he speaks in. However, the script is a shade better, replete with humor and love. But it is heavy-handed, especially during the end. Sly is better a screenwriter here. The choreography of the boxing sequences is anything but memorable though, as it never gains steam. The climatic boxing scene seems rushed and irresolute. Sly could've sought professional help in these sequences than writing it himself.\n\nTalia is spot-on as the highly introverted, taciturn girl-friend who breaks down hysterically in one of the scenes. I could emphasize with her since I myself am a very introverted but caring person who have bouts of hysterics. The most captivating quality is that Talia doesn't speak much but remained composed in a way that radiates untold emotions. Her character is unfairly treated in the end where she seems more like the heroine from Grease who runs to her love in the end.\n\nOthers in the movie frankly don't matter much. Burt Young as the crass, resentful but attention-seeking, insecure brother of Adrian, to be honest, was plain forgettable. Burgess as the surly coach with a story of failure in the past is generic to the extreme. His \"come on, Rocky\" chants really don't work because such character is more suited for a college movie with unruly youngsters (i.e. Grease). Carl Weathers' character Apollo reminds me of Lady Gaga, and he is more of a friendly villain here, which is a contrast from other sports movies, but I prefer the old-fashioned ones, a figure to hate.\n\nThe story at times gets to verbose or drab, as one always expects a broken tooth or dislocated shoulder in the middle. Two fights won't do for a classic sports film. The direction is schmaltzy at multiple places, though noble at a few. The background score, even though had some potential hits, didn't have an enlivening effect to make you go \"YaY!\" in the end. Considering the tight budget, these slights errs can be forgiven. But even films with shoe-string budget can deliver better. And next time, please let Talia do the talking and Sly more action. May watch and review the sequel when I am free, though I am not too keen on it. 5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "People have often asked me, \"What's your favorite movie ever?\" Without any hesitation my answer is Rocky. The inspiration behind this film is an interesting one. In 1975, there was a boxing match world the World Heavyweight Championship between Muhammad Ali (champion) and New Jersey club fighter Chuck Wepner (challenger). Nobody gave Wepner a chance; everyone thought Ali would knock him in less than 3 rounds. However, Wepner fought hard and went through 14 hard rounds with Ali, until being knocked out in the 15th and final round. Wepner even managed to knock down Ali in 9th round. Now you're probably asking yourselves? What does this have to do with Rocky? Well, you see everyone is an underdog in some ways, just like Chuck Wepner and the title character, Rocky is no exception. This is film is a great underdog story.\n\nThe title character Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is a Philadelphia club fighter, who really isn't making much doing what he's doing. Everyone, including his own trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) sees him as being a bum fighter. Outside of boxing, Rocky makes a living by collecting money for the local loan shark, Gazzo (Joe Spinell). Meanwhile, Rocky has an interest for his best friend Paulie's (Burt Young) sister Adrian (Talia Shire), who works in a pet shop across the street from the boxing gym Rocky works out in. Every time Rocky tries to talk to her, she doesn't seem interested, that's when he turns to Paulie to help him out. Eventually, Rocky and Adrian go on date on Thanksgiving. The highlight of that date is a wonderful scene where Rocky and Adrian go ice skating, and make a connection with each other. Soon after, they are considered to be a couple.\n\nMeanwhile, the current World Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) has a title defense coming up. However, his opponent ends up getting an injury that ends up canceling that fight. Now Creed and fight promoter, Jergens (Thayer David) are franticly trying to find a replacement opponent for Creed. They eventually find Rocky. Jergens and Creed's trainer (Tony Burton) don't like the idea of Creed fighting an unknown fighter. However, Creed is insisting that Rocky would be the perfect opponent as he's an underdog and America loves underdogs. Also, Creed claims it will be an easy fight, as he believes that will \"Drop him in 3.\" When the offer is bought up to Rocky about the fight, he first declines. However, Jergens convinces Rocky to take the fight, and does.\n\nNow, all the sports writers and fight fans, are wondering why Creed would pick an unknown fighter, which they feel has \"no virtually chance at winning.\" However, Rocky believes in himself as does Adrian, who gives Rocky a huge amount of support. Rocky just wants to prove that he can go the distance. Can he do it? Rocky is a wonderful film. Stallone has done a great job at writing this underdog story. There are some excellent performances by Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, Burt Young, and Burgess Meredith. I'm not saying this, because it's my favorite film of all time, I'm saying it because it's true. There is even one particularly great scene that makes you want to jump up and cheers for Rocky. The fight scene is also very good; it plays out like a real boxing match, and doesn't go too over the top as a \"Hollywood fight.\" Everyone is in some ways an underdog. Rocky shows that if you work hard, you can accomplish anything and be able to \"go the distance.\" This is without question Sylvester Stallone's best film. This is a classic, and truly one of the greatest films of all time.\n\nBy: Chris E.\n\nRating: 4/4 stars"

        "review_detailed_main": "Despite horrid sequels, \"Rocky\" is one of the most influential films of all time and should be, without a doubt, on the top 50 greatest films list. Putting it below 200 is just ridiculous. It has superb acting, a great story, and a phenomenal iconic following. Also, it can relate to anybody because everybody has been the underdog at one point. Maybe not the greatest sports movie of all time (I'd give that one to \"Raging Bull\") but it is the film that everybody references and spoofs. Featuring so many classic moments (eating the raw eggs, pounding the meat, etc.), its the typical underdog story that was made before it was typical. Every other story or film made nowadays involving somebody being the underdog is just a child of this film and how powerful and moving it is. In my opinion, the silly sequels (mainly 3, 4 and 5) have given this film a bad name and a bad reputation. Definitely a pure cinematic masterpiece, Rocky also won 3 Oscars, including Best Picture, which many of the films that are ahead of it on this list haven't even came close to. One reason why this film is great is because it came from Sly's heart (he had a struggling life and this film was his million to one shot, quite possibly one of the reasons why this is one of the few films he acts well in). The rest of the films in this series are made for money, which is the only thing they have going for them."

To me the movie is pure poetry & one of the most beautiful love stories of all time. Filled with outstanding performances by a stellar cast Talia Shire,Burt Young,Carl Weathers & Burgess Meredith are all magnificent. As for Sylvester Stallone himself he produces a performance of such heart & soul it brings a tear to the eye..He is magnificent & in my opinion should have walked away with an academy award for best actor.The gritty urban streets of 1970s Philadelphia offer the perfect backdrop to the characters plights & the now iconic Mighty Micks gym & Rocky steps stand out in the midst of the drama.The music by Bill Conti is a classic score filled with sadness & triumph. The movie has everything....Heart,soul,pain,fear,love & laughter..A masterwork of cinema. Hats off to Sylvester Stallone & thanks for giving us Rocky."

        "review_title": "\"Rocky\" is one of the best films of the 20th century, it will certainly be remembered in the memory of many and it still works for several generations",
        "review_detailed_main": "When he sold his script (written in three and a half days, as a result of the emotion experienced after a Muhammad Ali fight seen on TV) to United Artists, dreaming to star in it, Stallone heard a lot of \"No!\" and \"You are not the right actor\" in the industry. Hollywood executives wanted names more famous than him as potential choices to live the Italian Stallion: the most highly rated were Robert Redford, Ryan O'Neal, Burt Reynolds and James Caan. But he stamped his foot: he would only sell the script if the role was his. It achieved its goal thanks to the support of producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff. The initial budget for filming the film would be $ 2 million, but they cut that amount in half to offset the risks of having a stranger as the protagonist. To make it all right, they thought of rising actresses like Carrie Snodgress and Susan Sarandon to live Adrian, but who led the character was Talia Rose Coppola Shire, sister of Francis Ford, known for The Godfather parts I (1972) and II (1974). For Apollo, boxer Ken Norton was thought of, but Carl Weathers was the winner of the shorts with the colors and stripes of the USA flag. Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), a mediocre boxer who works as a \"collector\" for a loan shark, has the chance to face Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), the heavyweight champion of the world, who had the idea to give opportunity to a stranger as a publicity stunt. But Rocky decides to train intensively, dreaming only of finishing the fight without being knocked out by the champion.\n\nWith the script signed by Sylvester Stallone himself, Rocky has in his text his greatest asset, showing the public the life of his protagonist, humanizing him as few times as seen, causing immediate identification with the audience. The boxer represents the ordinary citizen, who goes through difficulties, but who has an objective, an ideal, a dream and who with a lot of willpower, determination and determination combined with a natural talent, manages to reach them. Stallone's script needs to focus on its protagonist, showing various facets of his life, which makes it practically impossible not to root for him. Rocky Balboa is, as said in the film, the perfect representation of the American dream of ascending and gaining possibilities from the 1970s. The story led by John G. Avildsen started one of the most well-known franchises in history. This first film had the courage to address courageous themes such as machismo, violence against women, loneliness, unemployment and the tendency towards a criminal life, characteristics that serve even more to highlight the best quality of the film that is its script, although lacking technique and resources, the simple story of Rocky is one of the best ever told in cinema. Right from the start, we already know that Rocky is a fighter who takes part in amateur fights in exchange for a few dollars. Do that because it is what he likes to do, what he feels he was born to do. As he does not earn enough, he also works in parallel as a debt collector for a loan shark Guzzo (Joe Spinell). Despite being able to \"break the thumb\" of the debtor who does not have the money to pay, Rocky prefers not to use violent methods. He's there to earn extra money, not because he likes to use violence outside the ring. The \"Italian stallion\", nicknamed that Rocky gave himself years ago, still has a passion for Adrian (Talia Shire), an intelligent girl, a characteristic highlighted by the stereotype of \"bottle-bottom\" glasses and has a fragile physical structure, which he is the victim of aggression by his brother Paulie (Burt Young), who is also a friend of Rocky. Even being a brucutu, Rocky touches the viewer because of his sad and lonely life and his naivete, values that transmit to his love relationship with Adrian, from the way they communicate, until the first kiss given in a disruptive way, but it does not matter, what is interesting to note is that even in a situation of poverty in a cloudy, gloomy and sad scenario, there is room for love to flourish and for each one to find a partner.\n\nThe success of the film is supported by several factors, starting with the performance of Stallone who managed to emulate a performance in the best style people like us, making most people, at some point, see themselves as the character. The actor also knew how to calibrate his relationship well with the other supporting actors, starting with the chemistry he had with Talia Shire. The construction of the relationship between Rocky and Adrian, is a huge success in the script, after all both are two people who are complete opposites and who complete each other. While Rocky is expansive, but does not have much study, is unintelligent and has always been encouraged to use his muscles for not having a great intellect, Adrian is precisely the person that his mother said she did not have a beautiful body and, for that, she would have to use intelligence to her advantage, in addition to being shy, introspective. The chemistry between Rocky and Adrian is a tremendous hit and makes the audience buy what happens on the scene. The two love each other genuinely and discover that they can truly support each other. The sensitivity of all scenes of the couple is very well constructed throughout the film.\n\nOther supporting actors are marked, for example when the protagonist is with Mickey (Burgess Meredith), a grumpy trainer who does not hesitate to criticize Rocky most of the time in the ring, a relationship that is well portrayed in the following films. Young Marie (Jodi Letizia) is also an important character, who reinforces Rocky's good heart, who seeks to advise the girl not to hang out with bad company in the neighborhood. And, finally, the relationship of the tiny Rocky with the absolute Apollo. You can see how fragile Rocky is in essence, trying to be kind or funny and failing in this mission, in addition to being completely unaccustomed to all the trappings promoted by a big boxing event, such as press conferences, press sessions and traditional provocations. out of the ring. Carl Weathers proves to be the right choice to be Rocky's opponent. It must be recognized that seeing the actor dressed as Uncle Sam and with the US flag when the end of racial segregation had happened less than 12 years ago. And he was also the one offering the American dream to a white suburban fighter - and also a criminal. A very audacious move for that time that deserves respect today. It is possible to feel a bizarre sadism on the part of the Apollo interpreter in wanting to humiliate Rocky outside the ring, taking advantage of his social condition and his common intellect. As a matter of fact, when it comes to the life of the central character, we can perceive the sure and clear intention of the photograph to be more monochromatic, adding a certain decadent and depressing drama to the cold and humid Philadelphia suburb, being an analogy with the situation of the American working class in times of recession. The social analogy that the film prints continues in the emotional clash between Rocky, The Italian Stallion and Apollo, where Rocky clearly represents the suffering and diminished American people against the famous boxer, the idol who, in a way, represents the proud side of the United States. When the two boxers enter the ring, the merits of the fight in question are due to the reality employed by the director, the skill of the actors and the hyper-realistic makeup of the violent marks left on the faces of the fighters.\n\nFull of iconic moments, Rocky's training scenes for the big fight with Apollo, whether swallowing raw eggs, punching meat in a refrigerator or any other more rustic method, very different from the more modern methods and excellent infrastructure that his opponent Apollo possessed at your disposal, like the great world champion, are also in the mind of any self-respecting movie buff. Given these factors, it is still necessary to highlight one of the most emblematic scenes in the history of cinema. Accompanied by an emotionally charged track by the song Gonna Fly Now, written by Bill Conti and ending on the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, one of the most visited places in the world by film fans, the scene makes the viewer recognize himself in motivation of Rocky to also say \"I can, I can\", taking this situation as an example for any situation you may face in your life, which is in line with the discussion at the beginning, due to the parallel of the situation that the citizen was facing terrible economic situation in his country.\n\nFor this simplicity in the script and the narrative that the film is so memorable and incredible. Rocky is just a simple and humble citizen who gets a great chance at random and ends up accepting her, without having a goal to win, he really wanted to prove his love for his wife and show his strength of spirit. Our tough character has all his disabilities converted into a pure soul. The fight does not matter, since the hitherto messenger boy of a loan shark managed to overcome his limits, win over the woman he loves and prove to everyone that with a good dose of perseverance and a good heart, the sky is the limit.\n\n\"Rocky\" is one of the best films of the 20th century, it will certainly be remembered in the memory of many and it still works for several generations. The production is not a simple boxing film, but a drama that talks about overcoming and, mainly, about the opportunities that appear in people's lives and how much to embrace them, however difficult the moment may be. Just what the American people needed in 1976. Perhaps that will help explain their Oscar victory, defeating, for example, Taxi Driver (1976), whose disillusioned and crude view was diametrically opposed and indigestible for many people."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sylvester Stallone plays the main character, \"Rocky\". Rocky is a local boxer only known to neighborhood residents and boxers at the local gym. He is an amateur with strong determination. Rocky was given the opportunity to fight heavyweight champ Apollo Creed, played by Actor Carl Weathers, known to be the best of the best. In accepting the challenge the underdog became the champ. Rocky believed in himself and conquered his dream. He stayed the course, stayed focused and never gave up. Unrealized to Rocky, the reason that he was not moving forward in accomplishing his dream prior to the Apollo challenge, was that he had no strategy and no proper training. He was never properly managed, just a man with a passion and a dream. When the manager from the gym Rocky attended learned of his opportunity to fight Apollo he asked Rocky if he could manage him. He knew Rocky had the potential to be a great boxer. He also knew that Rocky did not understand how to improve on the talent he already had. This task was now Mickey's (Burgess Meredith) responsibility. Through the course of the movie Rocky falls in love with Adrian Pennino (Actress Talia Shire) after pursuing her for a very long time, she eventually became his roommate. Paulie Pennino, played by Burt Young is Rocky's best friend and Adrian's brother. Paulie was very adamant about Andrian getting out of the house and enjoying life before she \"dried up\". After successfully forcing Adrian to go out with Rocky, Paulie's actions caused the two to become roommates. Everything Paulie did to and for Adrian was out of love and concern. The music in the movie is the greatest technique used. Sylvester Stallone became Rocky in this 1976 movie. To this day, there are certain songs that can be played and the first thing that comes to my mind is \"Rocky\". Throughout the movie the music and sound placed strong emphasis on Rocky's emotions and where he was at that point in his career. The music drew me emotionally into the characters and the movie as a whole. The lighting and angles were very impactful and worked together throughout the movie.The lighting created a sense of poverty in Rocky's neighborhood and within his home. The angles contributed to the effects of the lighting even as we watched Adrian's body language as she was a lady of very few words. Rocky is definitely a movie that shows that love will conquer fear, determination will conquer adversities and dreams do come true."

        "review_detailed_main": "1976's best picture winner \"Rocky\" in my opinion is one of the better films ever made it touches your emotions in so many ways it's just not a boxing movie, it's simply a tale of a human spirit triumph. It's also a significant film for the way it was made. Sly Stallone virtually unknown and broke got the inspiration for this when real life and underdog boxer Chuck Wepner had went the distance with the \"Greatest\" Muhammad Ali. Stallone wrote the script on a shoestring budget and it's a real knockout winner and sentimental favorite for many reasons.\n\nRocky Balboa(Stallone)a fourth rate and tomato can Philadelphia club fighter is a man who's lonely and at 30 even resorts to earning a living as a collector for street thugs on the mean streets of the city of brotherly love. Yet still buried deep down he has the desire and the hunger and heart to be a good fighter.\n\nAlong the way the film is also somewhat an emotional journey of a love story as Rocky finally finds some companionship and love when he meets a shy and ordinary and lonely pet store clerk named Adrianna(Talia Shire). Plus very memorable and comical is the supporting performance of Adrianna's brother the funny and very rugged looking and rude Paulie(good performance by Burt Young). The best of the supporting cast and maybe one of the best in film history is from legendary Burgess Meredith as Mick the tough and rough but very wise and humble old man. Who after some friction and doubt sees the determination and fire that the Italian Stallion has, so Mick decides to train Rock for a title match against the champ Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers).\n\nFor a film that's very cherished and memorable the performances are great, the acting, story and even the musical score is touching the sounds are some of the best in film history. The movie seen by many so many times is a true classic for it's tale of an underdog who went the distance an unknown who became known a hero to the working class. The film is truly an inspiration and it proves with work and determination and hunger the human spirit can achieve anything. It's not always whether you win or lose, but how you fight and it's important to go the distance. Overall a classic one of the best films in history for it's inspirational message proving that with the desire to fight your spirit will go the distance!"

In Sylvester Stallones script, a Boxer, who \"running out of steam\", gets a shot to fight the champion, Apollo Creed. Then the fight of the century is on- Apollo Creed VS The Italion Stallion. Rocky trains very hard psychically and mentally for the fight. What makes the movie all the better is the use of Steadicam in the fight scenes. Beautiful Cinematography and an inspiring score make for the greatest boxing film of all time. Sylvester Stallone is brilliant as rocky(maybe his only brilliant performance of his life), and the supporting cast are excellent, and act out their characters truly and superbly.\n\nSome may say Taxi Driver should have won best picture 1976. I love Taxi Driver, but Rocky is the better all round film, which will appeal to most people. I know the sequels are rubbish, but that doesn't change the original.

Stallone's script is really good at capturing this dual quality. So much of this film is just easy naturalism. The central love story is the most ordinary love story in the whole world. Paulie and Micky are just a couple of guys who missed their shot and resent Rocky for it.\n\nAnd yet for all that easy naturalism the film has a grand quality to it. The fights are quite good, especially for the time. The film is filled with symbolism, some of it quite overtly religious. Creed riding in as Washington is a mythical image about American mythology. It is not surprising that this film spawned so many sequels. Americans love sagas too."

He was Mohamed Ali without real depth in this and the story could have used to develop him a little more in the first one.\n\nBut... we got it in the sequels.\n\nThe biggest selling point was the love story... I know mushy, right? ... but they did a great job of making it awkward and at times intimidating as well as absolutely sweet and charming and it was completely realistic and believable.\n\nYou could sit down and watch it and understand how they fell for one another. You got a sense of who they were and that carried over into Rocky II... but kind of ended in III and we only caught a glimpse of it here and there until Balboa.\n\nStill, it was the low budget movie that stole out hearts. And it was the inspiring story about the underdog, and Rocky movies are best when they inspire."

They're far from rich, not in the social elite, have been beaten down by life, don't fall into any real clique social category but deep down they're all good people. Yes even Paulie lol.\n\nYes Rocky gets a once in a million chance to battle for the heavyweight title but it's the character development that makes this movie still likeable/relevant for me. It was great the way Rocky and Adrienne drew strength from each other.\n\nImo, this movie and Rocky 2 were the best of the franchise. Rocky 6 was solid as well.\n\nGreat movie soundtrack as well. Going The Distance is my personal favorite off it"

        "review_detailed_main": "Rocky is still a movie that is enjoyable 40 years on. Released in 1976, the movie itself could be classed as an underdog story that came out of nowhere that was met with critical acclaim as well as a box office success. Rocky also netted 3 well deserved Academy Awards but unfortunately nothing for Sylvester Stallone who was not only the main star of the movie, but also wrote the screenplay. Rocky was also the movie that catapulted Sylvester Stallone into stardom.\n\nRocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is a small time boxer in Philadelphia struggling to make ends meet in the ring and outside the ring where he earns a meagre wage as a debt collector for local crime boss Gazzo (Joe Spinell). To make matters worse Rocky finds himself on the outer with his trainer Mick (Burgess Meredith), with Mick dismissing Rocky as someone that has needlessly wasted his talent as a boxer. Rocky's fortune changes when heavyweight champion boxer Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) seeks out an unknown after his scheduled opponent withdraws after injuring himself. Apollo Creed picks Rocky on the basis of his nickname \"The Italian Stallion\". Rocky also finds love after hooking up with the shy and timid Adrian (Talia Shire), sister of Rocky's good friend Paulie (Burt Young). Mick also mends fences with Rocky and agrees to train Rocky. Rocky trains harder for his million-to-one shot at the title to earn his own self-respect and vows that no matter if he wins or loses, he wants to go the distance with Apollo Creed.\n\nSylvester Stallone is a delight to see light up the screen as his now iconic character Rocky Balboa. After a successful shot at box office glory, Rocky spawned 5 sequels as well as the spin off movie Creed (2015).\n\nDirector John G. Avildsen nets himself a well deserved Academy Award for Best Director bringing the story of Rocky to life on screen but the main driving force is Sylvester Stallone who fought to have his screenplay made into a movie after being inspired by the Chuck Wepner-Muhammad Ali fight in 1975 which prompted Stallone to put pen to paper and the end result paid off with Stallone triumphantly earning himself a winner.\n\nThe now inspirational theme \"Gonna Fly Now\" is synonymous with Rocky which plays during the montage of Rocky training his heart out at the gym and running around Philadelphia which ends with one of the famous scenes of the movie as Rocky runs up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art and triumphantly makes it to the top of the now famous \"Rocky stairs\".\n\n40 years later, audiences still loves to cheer for Rocky as they watch the underdog Rocky Balboa earn himself a shot at the championship title.\n\n9/10."

It's not stylish, not cute, not even close of being extravagant.It's just one of those incredibly real films, based on the life of Rocky Balboa, a man who found the strenght to fight for a shot, any boxer will kill for, the heavyweight title of the world.\n\nThis film isn't all about boxing, in fact only last third really shows box, in the actual sense of the word. It's about the world we live in, a world in which today you are notorious and tomorrow nobody knows who you are. Well Rocky Balboa remained the same, a sincere, maybe not so clever, funny guy, who fought for acclamation and became the Philadelphia dream.\n\nWe are all looking, in a way or the other, for that one chance which may, or may not change our life, depending on how much, and how hard we can fight to keep it alive. Rocky did just that, he had nothing to lose and everything to gain. It may seem like an easy decision, but I guess there's no pleasure in meeting the heavyweight champion in a 15 round of boxing, match.\n\nI will always respect Sylvester Stallon for giving life to this amazing film. He was the first one to say: Hey what if we do this? and for that we deserves all the praise. I think he did a pretty good job as Rocky Balboa, actually the whole cast did a great job, nothing to criticize here.\n\nMoreover the sound was absolutely awesome, it gives you an unique sensation, can't leave you indifferent.It suggested to me the same passion, and desire the film brought up so successful.\n\nWith all being said, i repeat myself, I liked this title so much because it is exactly what I was looking for, a getaway from all those ordinary criminal films, a film which shows us the real value of self respect and desire, in a way which deserves all credits.That is why I rate this title a ****1/2 out of *****"

The theme music is rousing and the climatic fight is just fantastic. It's predictable as they come, but it's all so well-done you won't care. A HUGE hit in 1976.

Then I realized Rocky was the best movie in the world. Soon after, I checked about Rocky over the Internet and found out about other Rocky series. I bought them all in a DVD set. I began liking boxing and started to train to be a mid-weight boxer. Today I am a mid-weight boxer. The Rocky series touched my heart and inspired me to work harder if a lose any fight. My life has changed ever since I watched Rocky. All my friend are influenced by me and they are a Rocky fanatic just like me. I am looking forward for the making of Rocky 6 if anyone ever makes that movie. I sure hope there will be a Rocky 6. For anyone out there who wishes to be a good boxer or have lost will and spirit in any aspect, please watch ROCKY, it will change your life forever.

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not going to attempt to explain how much i love this film. I may honestly be the biggest Rocky fan there is. I don't have a room filled with posters and Rocky coffee mugs. I don't know Stallone's shoe size or any stuff like that. But that's not what a true fan is. A true fan is someone who appreciates the movie more than most do. Every time i watch this film i'm reminded of just how much it means to me. By far, it's my favorite movie.\n\nWhat people have to say about Rocky have become clich\u00e9d statements. Not because they are, but because when dealing with a movie like this, that's really the only way you can sound. And to me, that makes it all the more impressive. When all you can say about a movie is who inspirational it is. Or how it truly grasps the human spirit, that shows how great of a film it is.\n\nRocky is so much more than a fighting movie. It doesn't do justice to it to even call it that. It's a movie that so beautifully defines the human spirit, that it's overwhelming to watch. It does what so many B movies tried to do and it does it without being corny or over preachy. It's an unfathomable movie which really should be recognized as a statute in film history.\n\nA lot of people poke fun at Stallone's acting carrier, but in this movie it's unlike anything i've ever seen. And i've seen a lot. Stallone was nominated for best actor and best screenplay and there's no doubt in my mind he was cheated out of a much deserved Oscar. His performance is so real and indescribably touching that it's hard to imagine there's a camera in front of him. The rest of the cast is also great. More than great. Burt Young, Tila Shire, and Burgess Merideth were all nominated for Oscars and in my opinion they all clearly deserved to win. Well, between Merideth and Young, i'd have to give it to Merideth, but it's very close.\n\nI'm fully aware of how clich\u00e9 it sounds, but Rocky is a movie which captures the human spirit. It inspires you to keep moving ahead. Against all odds, in your darkest moments of despair you have to pull yourself together and keep going. We all have a chance in this life to do what we aspire to and no matter how large or small that chance may be, it exists. And it's worth fighting for.\n\nThat's what Rocky embodies, and it does so beyond all expectations."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rocky seems to be a movie that has suffered in reputation from the legacy of the series as a whole. It is fair to say the series went on to become unrealistic in the extreme and while I have a fondness for parts 2-4 (5 is not good)I honestly believe that the first Rocky movie would be far better thought of without the sequels and the career path that Stallone took.\n\nWhile the films that followed became event movies, sports action movies the first is a character portrait. Stallone will never better his first performance as Rocky Balboa (although his turn in Copland does come close). Rocky is bitter and has a real dark side. He is unable to relate or communicate with most people and he seems to lead a very insular life. He is at the bottom, a bone breaker for a loan shark with no future. As a boxer he is told early in the movie by Mickey that he had the tools but wasted them. He is a two-bit club fighter and a bum.\n\nLuck (or the American dream) knock on his door when the World heavyweight boxing champion picks him at random, because of his nickname (The Italian Stallion) for a shot at the world title. Unlike the films that follow the chance is dealt with in the most realistic fashion. Rocky is scared. He fears for his safety but most important is his pride. If he can go the distance with Apollo Creed he can finally hold his head high, he will have achieved something.\n\nOne of the very best things about this movie is the fantastic supporting cast. Carl Weather's portrayal of Apollo Creed is flawless. The Ali inspired champ is totally convincing not only in but out of the ring. Without this cocky, arrogant foil then Rocky's accomplishments would not mean as much.\n\nTalia Shire is excellent as the meek Adrian and the late Joe Spinel is as watchable as ever as Tony. But the special mentions should go to Burgess Meridith who plays the physically weak but emotionally tough Mickey with brilliant fragility and Burt Young who plays the unhinged Paulie with a disturbing ease. The scene in which Mickey goes to Rocky to offer his management for the fight after the way he has treated him with utter disdain is heartbreaking and brilliantly acted on both sides. Mickey realises it is his last chance and despite Rocky's anger he knows that he needs his help more than anything. The conclusion of the sequence, where Rocky runs onto the street after Mickey, having chastised him, and accepts his offer is one of my favorite movie moments ever, played in long shot with no dialogue.\n\nThe locations are superb, the streets of working class Philidephia, the city of brotherly love, are the perfect place for Rocky's grubby life to be played out. This is the factor that Rocky 5 tried to recapture but couldn't years later. The city is almost a character in the film, one of the many factors that holds back Balboa.\n\nThe crux of the matter, the element of the film that makes every other element work is the fact that Rocky doesn't win the fight. If he had the efforts at realism and character details would have been for nothing. Rocky's triumphs are personal not physical, he succeeds but doesn't win and that makes the film all the more impressive"

Stallone wrote and starred in the Lords of Flatbush it launched a lot of careers but failed at the box office.

He only had 120 dollars in the bank. Inspired he wrote Rocky in a fever pitch during the course of three days. Stallone sold it but stipulated that he and only he play Rocky. A gutsy move that paid off. Rocky had the makings of a hit. The Studio didn't want Stallone as Rocky they wanted Burt Reynolds or Jon voight. but Stallone stood his ground and won\n\nRocky is about a local club fighter Rocky balboa. rocky is broke and humble. he has a good heart loves people and tried to do his best.

As Rocky trains and tries to come to terms. he's scared that he's just a bum but he has one slim chance at proving that he isn't. nobody has ever gone the distance before with Creed.if he can then he can prove he's a good fighter. And has done something nobody before has ever done. Just the writing alone is incredible. the depths of personality that Stallone infused into his characters. they live they breath and they are full of passion. More then anything else that alone elevates the movie into Cinema immortality. Rocky might not be the greatest film ever made. but you'll be hard pressed to think of another one that's stood the test of time from 76. Rocky does. And it stays in your memory nicely."

Micky's character was great too and burgess Meredith was the best guy for the job. one thing is for sure that rocky isn't a boxing movie. it will touch your heart and will make you chase unfulfilled dreams. the climax of the movie is great and the closing moments will bring tears in your eyes.in all rocky rules. 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Rocky Balboa is a Philadelphia boxer whose career in the ring appears to be going nowhere. Apollo Creed is the heavyweight champion of world who is due to face his next challenger in a fight in Philadelphia but with a matter of weeks to go the challenger is forced to pull out. Not wanting to abandon the bout Creed decides to give a local boy a shot at the title... that local boy is Rocky. At this point Rocky is working as muscle for a local loan shark and trying to get his friend Paulie's sister, Adrian, to go out with him. He doesn't think he has any real chance in the fight but trains hard in the hope that when the day of the fight comes he can at least last the fifteen rounds.\n\n'Rocky' is always going to be considered one of the great boxing movies but it is so much more than that. It is a character study of a man whose life was never going to go anywhere till he gets that once in a lifetime chance. He grabs that chance and despite his doubts he sees it through to the end. Just as important as his boxing is the way his relationship with Adrian develops; it feels natural and avoids many of the expected clich\u00e9s. His other relationships are also believable as the characters feel real rather than the usual Hollywood types. Sylvester Stallone does an impressive job in the title role but impresses even more for writing the story and getting the film we see made. The rest of the cast is solid; most notably Talia Shire, who is a delight as Adrian; Carl Weathers, who plays Apollo; Burt Young, as Paulie; and Burgess Meredith as trainer/manager Mickey. While the fight scenes are only a small part of the film they are pretty well choreographed even if it is occasionally obvious that punches aren't really connecting... they are close enough. Overall I'd recommend this to all film fans even if you don't like boxing; it is about characters not the sport."

        "review_detailed_main": "I never for one second appreciated the first time i watched the first Rocky movie. Being about 8, i actually didn't even know who won the first fight between creed and balboa, i'd paid that little attention to it. being told of course over and over that \"the first is always the best\", \"huh, yeh right\" i thought. I'd expected it to be like rocky 3 or 4, but better. They were the films id grown up watching first off as a kid and loved them! The all action blow outs, with big hitting rounds of straight to the point boxing. At the time i felt it to be just too long, too boring and just so action less in comparison, and lets be honest, action as a kid is what we all wanted! I then eventually got to wait up late one evening and watch number 2, so basically i watched them all over the place in terms of order.\n\nHowever, much further down the line in my life, i watched Rocky for the first time in about 16 years, nothing els on, i had nothing to do, so i just sat and watched it. By the end of the film, having wiped a tear i might add too, being much older, and much more appreciative of life in general, of course having now gone through some of the difficult riggors of growing up and seeing first hand what life can throw at us, i was completely touched and blown away by the overall relevance of this film, i no longer found it boring, old school, too long or action less, but was actually taken in and enchanted by the whole story, not to mention you get the first true glimpse of that famous music and feel good factor that the whole rocky saga brought to us all. The fact i understood what was actually going on this time made an over riding contribution to me loving and really appreciating the story of the film.\n\nI guess one of the biggest regrets i have thus far was watching this saga half way through first off, missing the first films out and watching them all in stupid order. I look back now and so wish i'd never watched the 3rd and 4th instalments first, but i guess for one reason or another that cant be helped as a kid, i mean mum and dad do what ever it takes to keep us happy as kids right? haha! So Having carried the opinion that the first rocky wasn't all that good kinda makes me sad i thought that now.\n\nAll in all i rate this film as one of the all time greats, deserving of its classic status and subsequent Oscar nominations and actual winning of Oscar awards, along with many other awards down the years, and of course the citical acclaim it received. As an 8 year old, i never knew i was watching something that never actually set out to be \"all action blow-outs\" but in fact inspirational, something that changed millions of lives, a hope giving and eye opening movie, something that was about to set millions of people on a jurney through life to get what they always dreamed of, and in fact sending that message across the globe that if u do want something, if u want to achieve, grab that life changing dream with both hands and is do-able, of course you can do it. Of course, it is only a film, but what this film did was inspire. A way to sum it up? a story of the unknown bum given a 1 in a million shot at the WBC belt, living the life of a small time club fighter, to eventual 2 time and multi defending WBC heavyweight champion of the world, a dream nearly every little boy had, I know i did."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rocky is regarded as the ultimate rags to riches story. It mirrors Sylvester Stallone's real life story.\n\nHe was a struggling bit part actor looking for his big shot. Stallone wrote the screenplay for Rocky in a few days and shopped it around. The condition being he would star as Rocky Balboa, a bit part fighter from Philadelphia.\n\nThe story was inspired by real life boxer Chuck Wepner, a nobody who fought Muhammad Ali for the world heavyweight title.\n\nRocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is an ageing bum who fights nobodies and earns money collecting for a loan shark. Boxing trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) has no time for him and even takes his gym locker away.\n\nRocky might be a little dim but he has heart. He spends his time wooing plain and shy Adrian (Talia Shire) who works in a pet shop.\n\nOpportunity comes knocking when world heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) cannot find an opponent to fight him. As America is celebrating its Bicentennial anniversary.\n\nThe Italian Stallion is the nobody who gets a shot at the title.\n\nCreed might think Rocky might be a pushover. Rocky is not going to lose this chance of a lifetime. Mickey who has been contemptuous of Rocky also wants a piece of the action.\n\nIt is a simple screenplay but director John Avildsen sprinkled it with magic dust. It struck a chord with cinemagoers helped by the stirring theme from Rocky composed by Bill Conti.\n\nStallone gives a career best performance. He was nominated for best actor and best screenplay Oscar.\n\nRocky won the Best Picture Oscar and Avildsen won for Best Director. It was a year when the other contenders were Network, Taxi Driver and All The President's Men. One of the strongest years for Oscars.\n\nMaybe nowadays the other movies are viewed as better films and more deserving for the Best Picture Oscar. At the time, All The President's Men was regarded as clever but too dense. Network was clever but too controversial. Taxi Driver was just too controversial.\n\nIt was Rocky though that knocked out the other contenders."

        "review_detailed_main": "I cannot tell you how many people make fun of me for loving this movie. Never mind the fact that it was the top grossing film of 1976, and won a whole slew of industry awards, including the highly coveted Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director. Perhaps it is the eventual deterioration of Sylvester Stallone's career (I still sympathize with the mental anguish that anyone who saw 1995's JUDGE DREAD in it's entirety suffered), or maybe it's the endless series of glitzy sequels and imitations that the film inspired (which did become numbing), but, for whatever reason, the reputation of this film seemed to get permanently soiled along the way. This is a shame, because ROCKY remains possibly the best underdog romance ever.\n\nAfter years of glossy sequels, it's a bit amazing in retrospect how grim and downtrodden much of the film feels. There is a moving aura of sadness and desperation that hangs over the majority of the film's characters, as if they all realize that they have wasted much of lives and are running out of time. Though he has (perhaps deservedly) become the butt of hundreds of jokes over the years, Sylvester Stallone (who also penned the film's screenplay) has undeniable charisma and displays mega-watt star power in this picture. Many people may forget this now, but many respected film critics actually compared Stallone to a young Marlon Brando when the film originally opened, and that high form of praise is rarely dispensed if undeserved.\n\nThe remainder of the cast is similarly winning, particularly the quiet strength of Talia Shire, long before she became a punch-line on the sitcom \"Friends.\" So many film romances have used the tired plot device of the ugly ducking who becomes beautiful by the film's finale, but Shire truly does make the transition from a put-on wallflower to a beauty right in front of our very eyes. Her transformation is so truly convincing that it makes the clich\u00e9 seem fresh. The sister of director Francis Ford Coppola, Shire still acts today (most in bit and supporting parts) with considerable regularity, but I would love to see her tackle another lead role again in the future.\n\nInspired by Mohamad Ali, Carl Weather's Apollo Creed is appropriately energetic and arrogant, while Burt Young's despicable leach of a brother is so unsympathetic that you actually start to like him about halfway through the film. Best of all is Burgess Meredith, whose short-tempered trainer could have ventured into unbearable campiness, but Meredith's fiery hostility is interlaced with considerable nuance. All these individuals seem less like film characters and more like real people, a feeling that is enhanced by the pseudo-docudrama style in which John G. Avildsen directs. And that, in and of it's self, is a far cry from all the glossy sequels that followed."

After getting illegally butted by the Spider a mad and outraged Rocky pounds him into the ring and into defeat.\n\nPushing 30 and with his best fighting days behind him Rocky works on the Phillie docks as a collector for local mob boss Gazzo, Joe Spinelli, to make ends meet. Even as that, collecting mob debts, Rocky is too kind and good natured, a real softy, to break peoples arms legs and thumbs who are late in paying up. With his life set as a low level hood, thats just what Rocky is a mob enforcer, and washed up as a professional boxer he had nothing to look forward to in the future. Meanwhile the World Heavyweight Champ Appolo Creed, Carl Weathers, is out of opponents to defend his title against and needs a new act to attract a big crowd for his next payday in the ring. Appolo and the top promoter in the world of boxing Jergens, Thayer David, come up with this great idea that to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the United States, in 1976. Why not defend his championship against one of the descendent's of the man who discovered America Italian navigator Christopher Columbus.\n\nAll at once the bleak future that was staring wash-up broken down club fighter Rocco Balboa became the once in a lifetime chance for proud Italian-America Rocky Balboa to show the world that he's not the bum or has been. Which everybody in the local boxing circles in Philidelpia thinks of him With the exception of his trainer Micky, Burgess Meredith. Rocky goes on the prove in the movie that he's a champ today as the champ that he always was of days past but never knew it.\n\nStirring boxing film about the rags to riches story of a nobody, Rocky, who became a somebody in the ring against the heavyweight champ with nothing more then the guts and determination and those who stood behind him throughout the entire ordeal. Rocky trains and works himself into a championship caliber boxer to fight the fight of his life. Even in the end when he lost a close fifteen round decision to Appolo Creed he won not only the hearts but the respect of the whole boxing world as well as the world itself.\n\nSylvester Stallone has never been able to top himself since he stared in \"Rocky\" and I doubt that he ever will. \"Rocky\" is a truly once in a lifetime movie and Stallone had just one once in a lifetime movie and he already used up his \"Rocky\". As good as the fight scenes are the movie is even more heart lifting and touching with Rocky's actions out of the ring. Micky who at first humiliated Rocky in public when he threw him out of the locker room and later wanted to train and manage Rocky for the big fight with Appolo and get the chance, like Rocky, to be a champ. Rocky after telling the old sick man off and practically throwing him out of his apartment runs out to apologizes for what he did and then accepts his offer and lets bygones be bygones between him and Micky. This was so effectively done with no duologue at all but you'd have to be dead or blind not to see and understand it.\n\nRocky's feelings for Adrian, Talia Shire, was even more effective then any of Rocky's fight sequence in the movie. The shy Adrian who was considered by everyone including her drunk and bitter brother Paulie, Burt Young, a loser like Rocky. With Rocky's kind and sweet attention towards Adrian showed that she was as beautiful when she got over her insecurities as he was, when he got his confidence back, brave and courageous in the ring against the worlds undefeated Heavyweight Champ Appolo Creed.\n\nWorking himself into shape with a tremendous uplifting sequence, to the movies theme song \"Gonna Fly Now\", of Rocky hitting the speed and heavy bag doing one-handed push-ups and running his heart out along the docks crowded streets and railway yards of Phillie. Rocky finally at the end of his long run makes it to and climbed up the steps, two at a time, of the massive Philidelphia Museum of Art. Which earlier in the movie he after doing his morning roadwork almost collapsed on. Rocky was now ready for his place in movie history in his battle with World Heavyweight Champ Creed in the city of Philadelphia.\n\nEveryone involved in the film \"Rocky\", Stallone Weathers Shire Young Meridith Spinlli etc. etc., their lives and their worlds would never ever be the same again."

        "review_detailed_main": "Some people will rub this off as just another standard fighting film, but it's so much more.. This movie is about a standard club boxer, Rocky Balboa. He's been trained for six years by Mickey before Mickey decides he's wasting his time, and gives away Rocky's locker to someone with more potential.\n\nMeanwhile, the world Champ, Apollo Creed, is preparing for his title fight, when news arrives that his opponent has an injury. Desperate to find another challenger, he stumbles across the Italian Stallion, our hero, Rocky. World Champion against a complete unknown - on Thanksgiving he decides to give a doubting underdog a great opportunity.\n\nSo there's the story. I consider it very involving, for such a simple premise. For Stallone, who hadn't written or acted in anything before, this is a mind-blowing movie. The acting really is top rate, as the doubting hero trains himself up to world class. Mickey gives him back his locker and seeing his new potential, takes him under his wing once more and trains him harder than ever. Along the way, his friend Paulie convinces his sister Adrian to go out on a date with Rocky, and they fall in love along the way. Don't be misled - this is not a romance film, but some of the sweet moments between them both really make the movie shine.\n\nEven the casting is spot on - Mickey is played perfectly by Meredith, and I honestly don't believe a single character could be played by anybody else, especially Apollo and Mickey.\n\nThe soundtrack supplied by Bill Conti is worthy of your attention, and really adds to the emotional content of the film, as Rocky becomes a hero. The final fight is intense, but nothing really award winning in itself, except for the intensity. Be warned, you're certain to find yourself screaming at the TV to \"HIT THE SOB!\" If you've never seen a Rocky movie, and you're a fan of Sly, or of boxing, or of just a damn fine film, I highly recommend you buy this, and with the 5-DVD box set now available for an awesome price, there really is no excuse to go without the series that made Sly awesome."

But it's not really just him, almost everyone in this movie sounds and acts like they're mentally challenged or something. Weird.\n\nLike many old movies, things move really slow too, scenes are slow, lots of dead air, but I'm sure at the time this wasn't an issue.\n\nWhat makes this movie great for me - someone who first watched it in 2022 - is the cute relationship between Rocky and his girlfriend. You don't see people supporting each other like that anymore. So pure and innocent, even despite the fact that both characters are extremely weird, or perhaps because of it.\n\nAnd we all love a story about an underdog. And the ending was beautiful. Maybe a little rushed, especially since everything else was so slow.\n\nBut in any case, I can see why people love this movie. And you don't see movies about pure, realistic struggle like this no more."

        "review_detailed_main": "Continuing my plan to watch every Sly Stallone movie in order, I come to his most famous role.\n\nROCKY is a legend given form in the shape of the biggest most satisfying, inspiring! Or simply\u0085 THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE!\n\n\"Rocky\" is quite simply one of the best movies ever made. A good movie for me is one that does not end with the credits, and \"Rocky\" certainly stays with you long after the final credits have rolled.\n\nPlot In A Paragraph: Rocky Balboa, (Sylvester Stallone) a small-time boxer gets a chance to fight the heavy-weight champion of the world Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), in a contest in which he aims to go the distance.\n\nIf there is anything to complain about (and this really is nitpicking) it's all the empty seats during the fight, but that really is nitpicking of the highest order!! The story is filled with the standard elements, but the movie is anything but standard. It's a love story, but set in the run up to a boxing match. It's a movie that leads to a boxing match, but the outcome of the fight is secondary to the characters reactions to what just happened. It's got friendship, second chances, people who hate for no reason and the greatest underdog story ever told.\n\nI can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here. Sylvester Stallone, who has contributed some tough fisted, hard as nails characters over the years, is perfectly cast as the title character, he should be, it's well known he wrote the role for himself. Burgess Meredith is always reliable, but here he is truly awesome. Talia Shire is also awesome as the shy Adrian. Burt Young and Joe Spinell deserve praise for their performances too, as does Carl Weathers for his turn as Rocky's opponent Apollo Creed. Tony Burton does well with what he has too.\n\nFavourite scenes (outside of the training and the fight) for me are Rocky and Adrian's first date and the \"I should have broke your thumbs\" scene. I also like a scene were Rocky's boss gives him $500 for training expenses too.\n\nAll this and I've not even mentioned the music. Bill Conti's score is absolute perfection. If I can't go in the ocean without hearing John Williams score for \"Jaws\" going through my head, I can't go for a workout or jog without hearing Conti's \"Gonna Fly Now\" but it's not just the inspiration trainin music that is great, check out 'First Date' on the soundtrack. Superb.\n\nI was recently privileged enough to run the Rocky steps with my two kids and Philladelphia's number one Rocky impersonator Mike Kunda. You can't have any idea what it meant to me to do that!! He also took us on a tour of the movies filming sites. It was great going round seeing all the sights from this movie.\n\nThis is basically a fairytale story in a different setting and feels very real. and at the heart of the movie is the greatest love story in the history of motion picture. thats right better than Jack and Rose in Titanic and better than Ryan O Neil and Ali McGraw in Love Story. here are two people totally devoted to each other and stay that way through six movies\n\nThe script by Stallone is exceptionally good and completely deserved the Oscar. Rocky is a treasure of a character and Stallone plays him to perfection, he really should have picked up an Oscar for that as well.\n\nAll in All \"Rocky\" is a highly professional piece of work, with a good sense of heart and atmosphere it makes for perfect entertainment. Sly Stallone take a bow sir."

I mean, who doesn't want a feel good movie that is goal oriented and inspirational? In the middle of the 70's decade, American movies like \"Rocky\" became progressively more optimistic, less concerned with social tensions. The happy ending made a comeback, as did such traditional values as the success ethic. Despite Rocky not being the sharpest tool in the box, he was tough and goal oriented and had that hungry look for the title. To be an average Joe off the streets and turned into the heavy weight champion of the world is incredible. I think that was what was so appealing to \"Rocky\".\n\nThis is Sylvester's best work in my opinion, and that's actually a compliment. He did a terrific job as \"Rocky\". I loved the chemistry between him and Adrien, a shy girl who just needs a little push and encouragement to be someone magnificent. \"Rocky\" is just a great all around feel good movie that makes you want to go the distance. Push yourself to do things you'd never thought, running at the crack of dawn, eating raw eggs, or even cutting your eyes to release the pressure. OK, maybe you won't do that, but Rocky did. Watch Rocky, you'll wanna go for a run after wards. :D\n\n10/10"

He earns the once in a lifetime chance to become something more when the heavyweight champion of the world Apollo Creed decides to give a local underdog fighter a shot at the title and selects Rocky. Rocky accepts the challenge and with the help of Mickey, the owner of the local gym, he begins training his body and mind for the fight of his life. Rocky is a great character story that still holds up today.\n\nIf there's one thing that critics and audiences agree on, it's that an underdog story usually makes a good film. Well, this is truly the greatest underdog film ever made, and it deserved every bit of praise it received. Rocky Balboa was a nobody, and to him it wasn't about the title. It was about having his name up in lights next to Apollo Creed. It was about doing something with his life other than roughing people up for money. This isn't an action packed boxing movie. It's very character driven. This doesn't even necessarily have to be called a boxing or sport movie. It's more of a drama that just happens to involve a man who boxes. The movie is well paced and well directed. Sylvester Stallone wrote a pretty good script with some good dialogue.\n\nThe movie is very well acted. Whenever people think of Sylvester Stallone they think of Rocky's voice, but most people should know that that's just the character, and Sylvester Stallone plays it well. Talia Shire does a good job playing shy and making the transition to outspoken. Burt Young is good as Rocky's best friend Paulie and Carl Weathers is good as heavyweight champion of the world Apollo Creed.\n\nRocky is a great classic that still holds up as a good movie today, and I look forward to seeing the latest entry in the series to see how Stallone ends the franchise.\n\n8/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Rocky\" is a classic film that tells the story of an underdog boxer, Rocky Balboa, and his journey to the top. The film stars Sylvester Stallone as Rocky, who also wrote the screenplay, and is directed by John G. Avildsen.\n\nThe film follows Rocky, a small-time boxer and debt collector, who gets a shot at the heavyweight championship of the world. The film opens with Rocky in the working-class neighborhood of Philadelphia, going about his daily routine of collecting debts and training at the local gym. He's a rough around the edges kind of guy, but with a good heart, who just wants to make something of himself.\n\nWhen the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed, announces that he will give a \"nobody\" a chance at the title, Rocky sees it as an opportunity to prove himself. He starts to train hard, determined to be ready for the fight of his life. Along the way, he meets Adrian, a shy and introverted girl who works at a pet store. The two of them form a relationship, and Adrian becomes Rocky's biggest supporter.\n\nThe film is a masterclass in storytelling and character development. Stallone's portrayal of Rocky is raw and emotional, capturing the character's grit and determination perfectly. The film also features a fantastic supporting cast, including Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed and Talia Shire as Adrian.\n\nThe film's most iconic scene is the final fight between Rocky and Creed, which is an intense and thrilling sequence that will have audiences on the edge of their seats. The film's climax is not just about the fight, but it's also about Rocky's personal journey and the person he has become.\n\n\"Rocky\" is a film that has stood the test of time, and still resonates with audiences today. It's a story about perseverance, determination, and the power of the human spirit to overcome the odds. It's a film that will leave you feeling uplifted and inspired, and it's a must-watch for anyone who loves a good sports film.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Rocky\" is a sports film that transcends its genre, it's a story of an underdog, who fights against all odds to prove himself, it's a film that will leave you in awe, it's an emotional film that will make you cry, laugh, and feel inspired. It's a film that will always be remembered as a classic."

Sylvester Stallone wrote an inspiring tale and powered it with his own solid acting and dedication to bring a cumulative result as one hard-hitting film that evokes all low dreams fellas. A small-time boxer gets a supremely rare chance to fight a heavy-weight champion in a bout in which he strives to go the distance for his self-respect. At the end he reaches the distance but the hardwork he had done deserved a lot more actually. Rocky might be a predictable film but the climax is always like a pumping station to get your nerves. I would have expected a victory at the end but it isn't there or may be it there but needs different perspective to look at it. In 2 hours of runtime the last fight hardly takes 8-10 minutes and the rest period still doesn't fail to keep engagement and pace at all. Sylvester Stallone looks so cute i mean i expected a hard narrow minded rough fella but he looks innocent unexpectedly. The choice of actress too looks interesting as she had to look sober at the beginning and beautiful later. Talia Shire suits perfectly in that role. Rest of the cast is good too and doesn't look dull anywhere. John G. Avildsen begins the film on a slow note, gives it a push after the first half and then blows up the real fire at the climax. May be that smooth going factor is missing but anyways the content is rich enough to survive the loss. Overall, Rocky is worthy enough to carry all the legacy since 44 years and hopefully it will continue carrying it. Sylvester Stallone as Rocky will remain immortal.\n\nRATING - 8/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest"

The Itallian Stallion, the amateur boxer who has to face the heavyweight champ. 3. Rocky, the movie that was made with less than a million. 4.

        "review_detailed_main": "Once in a long while, there comes a film that has such tremendous gestalt that it rises above any negative criticism. \u0091Rocky' is such a film. It is more than just a story about an underdog boxer who makes the best of a title shot. It is a story about perseverance, heart and courage. Most of all it is a story about transcendence. All the major characters in the film, including Apollo Creed, transcended their previous limitations. If you reflect on it, Mick, Paulie, Adrian and Rocky were all changed people by the end of the film. Apollo was changed too, but we didn't realize it until the sequel.\n\nThe film was also a transcendent event for Stallone, and served as an allegory of his life. If there ever was an underdog in Hollywood, it was Sly Stallone. His trademark droopy eyes and slurred speech were the result of a severed nerve at birth, and this disability was not conducive landing roles as a leading man. As a child, he was teased for his slur, and coupled with his name endured a childhood of Tweety bird jokes. He knew a little about fighting. He was expelled from fourteen schools by the time he was fifteen. In the film, when Rocky was knocked down and his corner told him to stay down, it was symbolic of his own life when his acting teachers at University of Miami tried to dissuade him from acting. In both cases he got up and proved them wrong.\n\nThis film found its original inspiration in a boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Chuck Wepner (a.k.a. The Bayonne Bleeder), an astronomical underdog who lasted fifteen punishing rounds and emerged with his pride and a face that looked like ground beef. Anyone who saw that fight and this film would see the obvious similarities in Ali/Creed and Wepner/Balboa. After seeing this fight, Stallone wrote the screenplay in three days.\n\nStallone had several big money producers interested in the script, but they refused to produce it with him in the lead. So he turned them down and produced it on a shoestring, grossing over $225 million and winning Best Picture and Director Oscars and acting and writing nominations for Stallone. Stallone should have stopped after the first \u0091Rocky' as the sequels did not and could not compare. However, I can't blame him for riding the gravy train after the price he paid for admission.\n\nStallone is brilliant in the role, as the inspiration came from his own life. He simultaneously elicits pathos and respect from the viewer. Though Balboa is none too bright, Stallone gives him a pure heart, unswerving desire and through sheer simplicity makes him the wisest of all the characters in the film. By the end, everyone in the theater is pulling for Rocky because to do so is to cheer for their own lost dreams. I still get a lump in my throat when he screams out, `Adrian' at the end.\n\nThis film is in my top 50 of all time. I'm partial to underdog stories and this is the heavyweight champion of that category. I rated it a perfect 10. \u0091Rocky' may not have been great filmmaking but it was great art. Would that life could always imitate art as well as it did in this film."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Rocky\" (1976), as far as boxing films go, this one, along with the other five movies, top them all without question. I do have to admit something though before I get into my review. As a kid, I didn't like the \"Rocky\" films nearly as much as I do now. But, as I got older, I gradually understood them better and learned to appreciate them more. Plus, as I grew up, the storylines were much easier to understand. Nowadays, I can't get enough of the six \"Rocky\" films! Any way, let's just get back to my review. \"Rocky\" has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The story at first glance just sounds like your typical underdog story of an amateur boxer realizing his dreams. I can assure you, it is much more than that. Yes, it is a boxing film, but it is so much more than that. It has many great morals, a decent love story, and more! This is the underdog story done right, where you personally care about the main characters and want them to succeed in the end. The acting is some of the best in movie history, all of the actors and actresses give it their all and put on stellar performances. However, the biggest standout has to be Sylvester Stallone as Rocky himself. Had someone else been cast in the role, it would not have worked. Sylvester Stallone is Rocky, and he always will be. It is, by far, his all-time best performance. Now, he has acted well in other movies, but Rocky is his signature character. Talia Shire as Adrian is a brilliant love interest, Burt Young is fantastic as Paulie, Burgess Meredith is phenomenal as Mickey and Carl Weathers is great as Apollo. One thing I always say, your main characters are only as strong as your side characters. Every role is performed flawlessly, therefore, impeccable chemistry between the cast is brought to the screen. All of the sets/locations are perfect and give the film a fantastic atmosphere. One cool thing about this movie, along with the other five films, is that it is filmed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The reason why that makes it stronger is because it's not too far from my original home town of Milford, Delaware. Just about a two hour drive away. Statistically speaking, it hits close to home! All of the special effects are perfect and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Bill Conti is nothing short of stunning. Bill Conti is one of my top 10 all-time favorite film score composers, and this soundtrack is no exception. My personal favorite track has got to be, \"Gonna Fly Now\". That's one of my top 10 favorite pieces of music in any film. Whenever I think about it in my head, my spirits rise and I feel like I can accomplish anything! \"Rocky\" is a cinematic masterpiece and the start of an iconic movie series. I can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you're looking to watch a boxing film, look into this movie. I sincerely promise that you will not regret it. Take notes, Martin Scorsese, this is how you make a boxing film!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I think Frank Capra said it all when after having seen the film, he said \"Now there is a film I wish I had made\" Rocky manages to be wholly realistic, and utterly uplifting. Performances from the leads right down to the minor supporting players are beautifully realised. It is very easy to see why Stallone was touted as the next Brando after this movie. His acting ability, delivery, and physicality are all reminiscent of the great man himself. Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, and of course Burgess Meredith are all wonderful. They take an already great screenplay and make it better by adding nuance, layers, and idiosyncrasies to their characters without trying to hog the picture. Whenever any of these actors appear on screen, it is like they are the star, and the movie could be about them. But let us not forget Stallone. He is the lynch pin around which the movie revolves. An acting style so natural you'd swear that it was a documentary. A movie that makes what should be unlikeable characters lovable, because you understand them. It is no wonder Stallone continued to revisit these characters a further five times. A truly great movie, that stands shoulder to shoulder with any other movie ever made."

        "review_detailed_main": "Many are unaware that Stallone got the idea of a screenplay for Rocky from a professional fight between little-known Chuck Wepner and Muhammad Ali. A fight in which little-known Wepner went the fifteen round distance with the greatest Ali. It took Stallone only three days to write the story of an underdog boxer named Rocky Balboa. Shot on a shoestring budget in just under a month, Stallone had the sleeper hit of 1976, winning Best Picture and Director Oscars while Stallone received acting and writing nominations. Rocky is a beloved classic for many reasons the film has a certain theme to it the film has more to it than fighting for the heavyweight championship of the world. Most importantly Rocky gives a message of fighting and standing up for what you believe in. No matter how much of an underdog you are fight for what you believe and prove the doubters wrong. Balboa proves this by finding love with shy Adrian(Talia Shire) proving no matter how awkward a person may seem love is possible for anyone and they can live the American Dream together. Rocky is more than a movie about a fourth-rate boxer who gets a shot at the title. Aside from finding love the film is a study of finding one's self through hard work and determination though Rocky Balboa(Stallone) taste defeat at the hands of Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers) he felt that of a winner for going the distance proving it's not whether you win or lose or draw , but whether or not you fight hard. Remember(Balboa) his whole life was a million-to-one chance. Sure Rocky was what made Sly Stallone a movie superstar, and Rocky also came to be a film that helped start what we call sequels. The main message in Rocky is for anyone who's ever won or lost hope and happiness are always possible. Success is possible to any underdog who works hard. Rocky is a symbol of the American Dream. Finally Rocky is one of the best films of the century a must watch for anyone and you will want to review the sentimental theme of the film many times. A classic forever."

I don't know how many of you realized that many parts of the movie were like a documentary of the life of an average American and if we cut the whole sport thing, the movie would have been a documentary that make us think and realize how lucky we are. Rocky's life sucked and boxing for him was something more than just hobby or something he likes to do. It's the thing that destroyed the bad thoughts in his mind. He might have seemed stupid and careless about what is going to happen to him, but I don't think so. Haven't you ever met a person who doesn't show he cares about something with facials, actions or words, but he just feels it inside him and he doesn't feel the need to release it. That was Rocky's character and that is why I love that movie. Well one of the many reasons. The supporting characters are wonderful as well and the original Rocky is something not to be forgotten ever while the sequels are just entertaining. Once again - a wonderful motion picture I will always love, with great atmosphere, score. Well some bad editing and direction, but who cares. A movie with no flaws wouldn't be a movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Boxing Film has long been a favored genre of the Hollywood output. Dating back to the earliest days, there has been a fascination with the fictionalized accounts of the 'Sweet Science. Hence, we have been treated to the likes GENTLEMAN JIM (Errol Flynn), THE GOLDEN BOY(William Holden), THE CHAMP & its Remake(Wallace Beery/Jon Voigt). We have also seen the Darker Side of Life in CHAMPION (Kirk Douglas), THE HARDER THEY FALL (Humphrey Bogart,Rod Steiger, Jan Sterling) and REQUIAM FOR A HEAVYWEIGT (Anthony Quinn, Jackie Gleason & Mickey Rooney).\n\nBoxing has long been a metaphor for life itself and so this screenplay represented the status of Mr. Stallone's own life and Acting Career. At 30 years of age himself, he held out to giving an okay to Producers Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler to do the film. The producers wanted Robert Dinero for the role, but old Sly was banking on this project's being his own long shot,to put his own career into the Success column.\n\nThis is not supposed to be much of a film, this ROCKY, it is not a Blockbuster or any \"critically acclaimed\" High Brow slice of Cinematic Art. But, lo and behold, the story holds onto the audience like a Pit Bull! All can watch it together as a Family Unit.And though it contains some very graphic and violent scenes in the Prize Ring, all is acceptable. Great care was taken here (as it was in the following Rocky Movies) to present a long, drawn-out Championship Bout, which would be somewhat fanciful, yet remain faithful to the realism that was a hallmark of the film.\n\nThe film is shot mainly on location in Philly. The cityscapes selected gives the viewer a look of beauty.We all have those bumps in the road of our daily lives.\n\nSly was right, for he was the guy for his own Script*. He did not have to 'get into this character's head, because this character originated in the fertile Stallone imagination. In one sense, Rocky was Sly.\n\nSome in the Boxing Fraternity were critical of the film's portrayal of the physical training and the lack of emphasis on sparring. With this one criticism considered and dismissed as minor, we can fully appreciate the scenes of roadwork, resistance exercise, speed and heavy bag work. The running scene done on the waterfront is of particular note, as Stallone really went all-out, hitting high gear in sprinting, with the water and the docked ships providing a most picturesque back drop.**\n\nTallia Shire played Adrian, a shy girl, who has grown up in a very quiet manner. She has not had much, if any, social life. She yearns for fulfillment in a drab existence of caring for self and working in a pet store, as a sort of female roustabout/cage cleaner/animal keeper. She lives in the same old family house with her older brother, Paulie.\n\nPaulie (Burt Young) is a heavy set, apparently powerhouse of a guy, who is employed in a meat rendering plant. He is greatly dissatisfied with things as they are and constantly shows these feelings. For example, he wants to better himself by getting a job like Rocky's as a collector for the 'Juice Man', Gazzo, powerfully portrayed by the very talented, the Late Mr. Joe Spinnell.*** Carl Weathers brings the Heavyweight Champion of the World to life. His portrayal is as right on the mark as his muscular physique and obvious athleticism is obvious. (He was a College Footballer as well as having done a stint in the NFL with the Oakland Raiders. He was a linebacker.) Carl's \"Appolo Creed\" is at once cunning, serious, and flamboyant. He is at once a dedicated, Spartanesque athlete, but also a business man. He is the one who makes the Match, even insists on his opponent be Rocky Balboa,\"The Italian Stallion.\" Other cast members include: Thayer David appeared as, the splendidly dressed Promoter Miles Jergens. Tony Burton is Apollo's trainer. We also have a great number of other well traveled supporting players in the cast. Two of our personal favourites are,Billy Sands (veteran of TV's SGT. BILKO and McHALE's NAVY) is cast as a Ring Announcer and George O'Hanlon (for years he was Joe McDoakes in all of those Warner Brothers Comedy Shorts as well as the voice of Hanna-Barbara's George Jetson on THE JETSONS, both on TV as well as the Feature Film.) Sylvester Stallone is certainly a loyal guy, as he has several friends and family in the film . His brother Frank Stallone, Jr. has his vocal group in it as the street singers(\"You guys get better every year!\") and Frank Stallone, Sr., their father appears as a time keeper. Why even Rocky's Dog, Butkus was the real life pet of Mr.Sly's.\n\nROCKY has been called an old fashioned \"B\" Picture.**** Well, maybe so, but if it is true, let Hollywood give us more, and more and more and more..........................., en ad infinitum!\n\n* The right guy, indeed! The whole story would seem to be an allegory, a metaphor for Life Itself, and in this case, Sly's Life and Career.\n\n** The action of the scene appears to have been augmented by some certain camera movement, making the whole sequence even more spectacular!\n\n*** The late Mr.Joe Spinnell had such fine talent. Having been discovered at an open casting call for THE GODFATHER by Francis Ford Cappola.\n\n**** The story was inspired by real life incidents. Chuck Wepner, as Journeyman Heavyweight Boxer, got a chance to fight Mohammed Ali for the Title. It was March 24, 1975 in Cleveland."

Beginning from a masterpiece best picture winner to a popular 70's and 80's franchise, this film goes to no boundaries of greatness. It, along with its followers, are all brilliant. Definitely one of the best franchises ever!\n\nThe story centers on south paw boxer tough guy Rocky Balboa,(Sylvester Stallone) who although gets paid doing boxing matches here and there, along with collecting money for a collector, can't make anything out of his career, or his life. Then, he finally gets his chance at turning his life around when he is challenged by Heavy Weight Champion Apollo Creed, who gives him the one shot at the biggest title in history. Rocky then prepares himself for the fight of his life, with his trainer Mickey, (Burgess Meredith), and his girlfriend, Adrian, (Talia Shire).\n\nThe movie outdoes itself in almost every area. Its editing, directing, casting/acting, and just everything else in general. It gives itself an emotional feel, letting you feel comfortable with the movie, and feeling for the characters. Half the movie shows what Rocky's life is like everyday, showing his everyday activities. Then, the other half consists of being challenged, and getting prepared.\n\nThe characters are some of best, classic characters of all time. Stallone gives an amazing Oscar nominated performance, along with a top billing cast. Talia Shire, as Adrian, gives a great performance as Rocky's incredibly shy, but very supporting girlfriend. Burt Young as Paulie, (Adrian's sister) plays a very bitter character as a abusively angered brother who always likes to yell. Burgess Meredith, as Rocky's bitter and broken down mentor, Mickey, is one of the most classic and greatest performances of all time. Mickey is an icon of movies, and he just completes the drama in the Rocky movies.\n\nThe build up to the fight is also amazing, for you are rooting for Rocky all the way, and seeing him tense and nervous, just makes you wanna see him go all the way. Although the opponent, Apollo Creed, (Carl Weathers) isn't considered a bad guy, you still wanna see Rocky beat him down.\n\nThe film is the absolute classic underdog film that is brilliant to no end. It is and will always be considered one of the best films ever made, especially in my book. Its epic, its amazing, and it will have you on your feet to the very end."

Great how its about numerous things, hobbies, money to be owed, charming relationships, and smooth scenery throughout no matter what the conversation is about it is all worth it. Sylvester Stallone is and always will be icon at least should be. I want to go through all Rocky films and see the Creed films those are probably great too."

Featuring a legendary musical score and thrilling fight sequences this rousing crowd-pleaser scores a knockout. The first time i seen Rocky i didn't really enjoy it but once you get older and watch it, it definitely lives up to the 8.1 rating it received on this, when i was young and watched this the reason i didn't like it as much as i do know is probably because of the lack of action as this film shows Rocky how he was before he got the shot at the title!\n\nROCKY is a knockout\n\n****/***** Very good"

        "review_detailed_main": "...Which is ironic for me to say that because I'll admit the first time I saw the original 1976 \"Rocky,\" I wasn't all that impressed. Maybe it was because of Sylvester Stallone, his hammy Oscar-nominated role as the \"underdog\" boxer Rocky Balboa, or its lack of in-the-ring action (which is saved for the last 20 minutes) - I don't know, and I'm not sure I'll ever know. The point is, after a lot of soul-searching and realizing that \"Rocky\" is the real deal (plus a convenient chance at re-watching the film in its glory), I find that \"Rocky\" is very easily one of the best movies ever made. The story of strength, determination, and the desperate need of a new hero in the wake of political turmoil during the 1970s helped Rocky Balboa's eventual rise to fame at the box office in '76, and his subsequent entry into pop culture history. At the heart of the film, is the title character, a hard-luck Philadelphia loser played gloriously by Stallone. The muscle for a local loan shark, his only real source of pride is in the ring, besting other fighters who are way below his skill level. On the side, he also flirts with Adrian (Talia Shire), the sister of his best friend Paulie (Burt Young) who is also the chronically shy clerk of the pet store where he frequents. When the reigning world heavyweight champ Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) discovers he needs a challenger for the upcoming Bicentennial because all the rest of the competition has bowed out, he chooses the \"Italian Stallion\" out of other contenders. When Rocky gets the news, he sees it as a chance to prove his worth and \"go the distance\" and start training with a former champ, Mickey (Burgess Meredith). \"Rocky\" was a huge hit in 1976, as Stallone's script floated around Hollywood for several years before being picked up by United Artists and given to director John G. Avildsen. Sure, \"Rocky\" gets off to a slow start. But that's part of its magic: to let the audience really know who these people are, and the lives they are leading. The big day does come, but there's something about the conclusion of the picture that will always remain true to real life, and about that once-in-a-lifetime, million-to-one shot at glory.\n\n10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Down-on-his-luck, aspiring actor Sylvester Stallone watched Chuck Wepner, a \"ham and egger,\" go the distance with Muhammad Ali, going as far against him as many greats of that era. That 1974 fight inspired \"Rocky,\" the story of a Philadelphia fringe boxer/wiseguy who isn't really good at either, scraping together a living collecting debts for Mr. Gasso (a loan shark), boxing for minimum wage, and the generosity of butcher friend Paulie, who wants in with Gasso.\n\nI saw this film twenty-three times on HBO in February 1978, when I first got HBO, but didn't really appreciate it until I had lived in Philadelphia for several years after moving from New York. The movie captures the spirit of Philadelphia, from its shiftless characters who barely have a niche in life, to the spirit of its citizens, who are like poodles that think they can \"go the distance\" with a pitbull.\n\nHeavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) has a New Year's bout that is in danger of being cancelled when the challenger is injured during training. Faced with having to refund the tickets and eat the overhead for the fight, Creed decides to give a local, unknown fighter a shot at the title. Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is chosen because of his nickname: \"The Italian Stallion.\" Rocky is tough as nails, but lacks the boxing skills of Creed, and sets as his goal, to go the distance, to leave the ring proudly on his feet.\n\nMickey (Burgess Meredith, ex-Penguin from the \"Batman\" TV series) is a boxing gym owner and trainer who puts the \"old\" in \"old school.\" After kicking Rocky out of his locker for being a thug, he begs his way back into training Rocky for the fight. With only five weeks to train, he doesn't even try to teach Rocky how to box, but more how to beat the living crap out of Apollo. He teaches only the rudiments of boxing and how not to fear the heavyweight champion of the world. Mickey trains Rocky to win, making the most of his own chance of a lifetime.\n\nCreed does not take the fight seriously, training sporadically, figuring he'll put on a good show for the crowd before disposing of Rocky. His trainer is more concerned, especially when he catches film of Rocky's devastating left hand. Rocky, who gets $150,000 for the fight, trains mostly not to embarrass himself, but in doing so he does the one thing Creed does not, and that is preparing to deliver a peak effort. Rocky doesn't know what he has, but whatever he's got, none of it will be left on the table at the end of the fight.\n\nThe fight begins with Creed using Rocky as a punching bag, until a minor slip-up allows Rocky to deck him to the canvas with an uppercut, sending the local fans wild. After a few rounds, when Creed has hit Rocky with everything he has but Rocky is still standing, Rocky begins to lose respect for creed, his street instincts kick in, and for the rest of the fight he has no fear of his opponent. Creed can box, but Rocky can break bones, and even the heavyweight champion is not immune to that type of destruction. Once Creed went down (something no other fighter had ever done), Rocky had already won, and he did not try to safely go the distance, but to do so as an equal. The result is one of the best fights in the history of cinema.\n\nThe Best Picture Oscar was well deserved."

Living in a beat-up apartment, as any average tough guy and turning around 30 years, this man is constantly humiliated, especially by his boxing trainer Mickey(Burgess Meredith), who puts Rocky's stuff away from his gym. Rocky is in love with the shy Adrian(Talia Shire), a pet shop worker and sister of Paulie(Burt Young), who is his friend who tries to help them to get together.\n\nA day, Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers) a heavyweight boxing champion organized a great boxing event for 4th July with another boxing fighter, however, the opponent gave up and then, for avoiding the financial prejudice, he had an idea, to give a shot to a unknown and underdog dude for fighting with him as a gimmick, then, he chose the unknown Rocky balboa. Knowing about it, Rocky does not believe in it, but afterward he accepts and then kicks off training hard for the great shot of his life.\n\n\"Rocky\" is a masterpiece, its cast is brilliant, especially the performance of Talia Shire, Burt Young, Burgess Meredith and obviously Sylvester Stallone, get us involved along the story with remarkable scenes of drama, conflicts and overcomings, definitely, it is a timeless oeuvre movie.\n\nAll men need to watch this movie because it instills great values like being strong, doing not hold other people responsible for one's own actions, never giving up, being kind to others, obviously, these values are valuable to women but the Rocky's personality emits what is good for the masculine nature, his way of being tough, strong, eager to take risks and look for adventure, in addition to be gentleman with women. Men and boys need to watch movies like that for becoming better people, especially for little boys, they need a hero as rocky to inspire with, nobody needs to be politically correct and due to the lack of this thing at the movie \"Rocky\", it is and will be, forever, a timeless masterpiece that enchants all generations."

The first film, is original and does not lose focus, something that (most) its sequels lack. There is nothing much different to discover after part one.\n\nOne of the greatest films of all time?

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, I must say, I always liked Rocky myself, but only saw the original after the Balboa movie came out. What moved me most about it was not the fighting, not his \"ugliness\" that some people say makes it more realistic and easier to related to; my favorite aspect of Rocky was the transformation the girl Adrian makes throughout the movie, her character, her look, her whole self. This, I believe, was what Stallone truly wanted to point out, even if he didn't admit to the tabloids - I think he wanted to say to the world that it's not the beautiful, extroverted women who truly deserve attention at times, but women like Adrian who live quiet, but shaky, mistreated lives and don't allow themselves to be heard. Realizing this throughout the movie put tears in my eyes, I won't even hide it. The reason this movie deserves Best Picture I think is because it focuses on the more positive human traits - love, honor, respect, etc, unlike Taxi Driver. No matter what movie I see about crime in whatever shape, I'm never left with the heartwarming feel I got from Rocky. And I guess the media agrees with me: look at the movies that Hot Shots - the 'mother of all movies' - chose to allude to to show a true love memento - Rocky, Superman, and... Lolita, was it? Anyway, the part when she rushes over to him after the fight was a huge climax that summed everything up superbly. I even expected that it would be her doing that that would get him to win, because that would've increased the voltage of the scene many times over, I think."

This movie, however, still moves me. The musical score is well done and provides emotion to the film. I think the only character that may have been done better is Pauly. Other than that this movie is intense and for a film made in 1976 the fight scenes are done pretty good. If you watch them though, there are flaws chronologically. Example, in the later rounds Rocky has no sweat on him in or bruises on his face or you will see a lot of empty seats in the arena. Just things to pick out. When you do watch this and you get to the part where Apollo Creed is being introduced and he is dressed like George Washington throwing money, you can hear someone laugh as if they were laughing at him.

        "review_detailed_main": "Spoilers I assume you saw this movie. The movie Rocky is about a down and out boxer in Philadelphia that gets a shot at the heavyweight boxing championship of the world and goes the distance with the Champ Appollo Creed, who no one ever went the distance with. At the same time it has a romance story between Rocky and his friends sister Adreinne.\n\nThe movie Rocky was the first to display the formula that many other movies followed to success. It used stark realism and a \"not so Hollywood\" result of losing the final fight, combined with the irony of Rocky wining his first fight a being considered a bum, topped off with inspirational music to bring the audience a realistic feeling of triumph of the human spirit. The movie is more successful than the many movies that followed it including all of the 5 Rocky sequels. Why? Well many have wondered about that. I have often thought about writing a fight club for women. I came up with a movie and guess what, it is really a rehashing of part of this story, revolving around someone like Adriene. The super success and critical accaim of this masterpiece lies in the fact that we have a movie of two characters being transformed by love, Rocky and Adrienne. This transformation is choreographed to great music.\n\nStallone was a down and out actor pitching a movie about a wrestler called \"Paradise Alley\", which no one wanted to make, when he as a second thought, pitched this movie to Hollywood execs. Stallone had not been remembered for his role in the Lords of Flatbush and he did not have much of a reputation at all.\n\nHe broke through with Rocky because it had tremendous supporting performances from Talia Shire, and Burt Young, not to mention Burgess Meredith, who I always thought of as the Penquin from the Batman TV Show, until I saw his great performance in this movie.\n\nHe also got a tremendous effort from Bill Conti who wrote the music. I read Stallone's original script, and I believe, the Director Mr. Alvidsen also did a great job editing the movie to the music. He also cut a lot of less meaningful scenes out of the end of the movie, to enable the music to overwhelm the audience in the end. (If you listen to the movie, the music is almost non-existent in the beginning and the music is more complex orchestrated and in every scene by the end)\n\nTalia Shire played Adrian the shy sister of Pauley, Rocky's best friend. As such, she had to show us she was shy, which is very hard to do on screen. She shows through fleeting glances at Rocky that Adrian has an interest in Rocky that she can not bring herself to show outwardly. She also brings out an underlying intensity when arguing with her brother, showing that when shy little Adrian is passionate, she can really gets her point across.\n\nAfter the big fight with Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), Adrian also charges through thousands of people when Rocky calls her at the end of the movie, which in miniature, became the formula for romantic comedies after this movie. Two people separated by obstacles come closer and closer until they finally get past all of the obstacles and get together.\n\nThe music of Rocky was awesome and inspirational. I especially liked the song \"Going The Distance\", which played during the big ending fight from Round 3 to round 14, when Rocky is taking the beating and hanging in. It is the most inspirational song in the Rocky movies. I also liked the song \"You Take My Heart Away\", which plays during the romantic scene when Rocky takes Adrian's hat and glasses off of her and reveals the real Adrian for the beauty she is.\n\nIn all a very ground breaking movie and rightfully it has been copied numerous times but never equaled."

If they put Burt Reynolds as the lead actor as originally hoped for by producers, this would have been a flop! I have never seen an actor born to play a role like Sylvester Stallone did on this movie! The only thing better than Rocky was Rocky II! It started to slip on Rocky III and really fell on Rocky IV, but picked back up on Rocky V and my only regret about this series is that a part VI was never made! I have had a yearning to meet Sly Stallone ever since I saw this movie! It kicks butt!!!"

Maybe it's because I've always loved an underdog and this is the story of the ultimate underdog; a man whose whole life centers on a million to one shot.

It's striking how this really is one of those films that I've coloured in my view of it over the years by things that are little or nothing to do with the film itself - toxic masculinity, cheesy sequels, a childhood embarrassment seeing Rocky 4 in the cinema, the culture that grows up around the film ... and much else. And yet ... revisiting it now, its qualities are striking. How little happens in the first 30-45 minutes or so apart from character and establishing the scuzzy, grimy, down-at-heel, urban feel, the sweet growing relationship with Adrian, who little actual boxing there is in the film, even the result of the fight itself. Its status as an Oscar winner, and everything Stallone went on to become and much else besides that has shaped my perceived opinion are all really moot; it's really pretty good. Who knew?"

        "review_detailed_main": "Thirty-two years ago a character legend named Rocky Balboa was born. A man on his 29th birthday received $200 dollars if I can remember. He spent half on his birthday needs and wants, and he took the rest to see a fight between Wepner and Ali. That man was Sylvester Stallone. That night he went home and wrote the story of his own life, although some sites will tell you otherwise he really based it off his own life. He had taken his picture down to agencies and people turned him down. One time he even erupted throwing furniture around the room because he didn't get the fight. He had had previous movies but they were not successful. He said that if Rocky didn't make any money all hope was lost. Nobody wanted Sly to play Rocky. Stars were looked at such as James Caan and Ryan O'Neal. But Rocky said he would play the part or he wouldn't do it at all. What followed was a movie phenomenon. Sylvester never imagined it would go as well as it did. This movie is perfect if you want a good story. I has a story of gentle, sweet, and wonderful love between Rocky and the shy pet shop Adrian. It has the meaning of getting self-respect by competing for the title of the heavy weight champion of the world and lasting the 15 rounds, thereby going the distance. This is a great family film. Other than the hanky-panky between Rocky and Adrian and the bloody images of Rocky, this movie is great for the young ones. So what are you waiting for? It you haven't already seen this movie, rent it or wait to see it on t.v."

        "review_detailed_main": "Who could dislike the film?, because it is just impossible to hate! Sylvester Stallone is nothing short of perfect in this one, still most properly his best performance to date. It would be very easy to compare Rocky with that of Raging Bull, only that would be an injustice because both films have completely different motives.\n\nRocky, a down and out boxer from the streets of Philadelphia, surrounded by poverty finds himself in the fight of his life against the champion of the world. Seems like such a simple premise, yet so much is happening between all it's characters, that the film never gets dull. The supporting cast is one of a kind. Talia Shire, Burgress Meredith, Burt Young, along with many others, all play roles that can be found down most streets whilst Carl Weathers wonderfully paints a picture of the ego that goes with fame and fortune as the Champ determined to give Rocky a hard time.\n\nUnfortunately, this film has been overlooked in terms of great films because of it's lesser sequels. It's a shame, because when you watch the film on it's own merit, it truly is one of the best romantic sports dramas ever made. I dare anyone to find a more heartfelt climatic ending in a film than this one. It's climax; a battered and bloodied Rocky frantically calling out for his real true love...Adrian!\n\nThe memories that viewers take home with them however continue to be director John G. Alividsen's training montage sequences, and of course, the final climatic fight. All hallmarks from a hallmark movie."

        "review_title": "The Underdog of All Underdogs",
        "review_detailed_main": "Rocky is an action packed underdog story, which's incredible acting and astounding musical set only accents the great storyline to the masterful piece. Robert \"Rocky\" Balboa, the story's main protagonist, is played by newcomer at the time, Sylvester Stallone. Balboa is your average \"mean streets\" guy, who is a bookie for a living. On the side, Rocky fights in small boxing matches to make some money to get by. All the while, Balboa is trying to woo the ever timid sister of Paulie, Rock's, what seems to be, only friend. Adrian, played by Talia Shire, is the object of Balboa's attention throughout. As Rocky and Adrian's relationship develops, he gets the shot of a life time against the champion of the world, Apollo Creed. The struggle Balboa must partake in both physically and mentally as not only a fighter, but as a human being, strengthens him all the way to the title fight.\n\nThe movie carries many underlying tones to help emphasize this fighter's tale. One main conflict in the movie is the clash between black and white. The civil rights movement was just beginning to die down at the time that the movie was released, which was 1976. What makes this setup unique is the role reversal that takes place. Typically, you have the uneducated lower class black man trying to fight against the slings of the wealthy upper-class white man. Now the viewer witnesses the polar opposite. Balboa fights his way up through the social ladder to even get to the level to where he can step in the ring with such a noble figure. The reasoning behind this is not to create more tension between races, but to prove the point that in social interactions, in this case, a boxing match, people are people, regardless of race. Anyone has the capabilities to achieve whatever they work for regardless of social restrictions. A punch hurts no matter who it happens to. Both of these fighters bring each other full circle and show a mesh between the races. In the bout, they are no longer black and white, but fighter and fighter. This brings a unity to the human nature.\n\nAnother thing that stands out is the reasoning behind why would they place this plot into a boxing theme. A main theme of social evolution can be shown in almost any circumstance. The director chose to put this story into a boxing setting to show, not only a physical fight, but a social struggle. The boxing match symbolizes the hurdles that people of all races must overcome everyday and the fight they put up against it. They fight to achieve this unity among ethnicities and to come to the point of the \"championship\" of society.\n\nAs the film progresses, familiarities begin to surface between the characters, which gives rise to the idea that every character is another form and mold of Rocky. Starting with Adrian, they are like yin and yang. From their initial encounter, the viewer can tell that these two characters fill gaps in each other. They become puzzle pieces seemingly fit together to become this one object. This idea can be carried over throughout each others worries and concerns throughout the film. In the ice skating scene, Adrian tells Rocky that her mother told her that she didn't have much of a body, so she better start using your brain. Rocky then explains that his father told him the exact opposite, that he didn't have much of a brain, so he better start using your body. This shows that they were basically made for each other and the only way for them to truly evolve, they must come together.\n\nNext up is Apollo. He is the polar-opposite of Rocky. The name says it all. Apollo being god-like, high and mighty, while lowly Rocky lives on scraps and on the dirt poor level. See the coincidence? Rocky stands for hard times and not a smooth life style, while the god Apollo lives the easy life. Then in their climatic bash, they offset each other no longer being individuals, but are now a cause. They now have meaning. Without each other they have only this bland individuality. In their physical interaction, they lose all of this and become the basis of human nature.\n\nFinally you have Mickey, Balboa's senile and delusional trainer. His wisdom and guidance is what brings light and truth to Rocky's eyes. Mickey is the older version of Balboa. He is the aged fighter trying to live his dreams through a new prospect. Mickey is your typical FOIL character. He shows the audience everything Rocky is not and the potential he has to become something more advanced. He is the wise old man guiding a blind young man around showing him how to overcome the trials and tribulations that both have or are going to experience. Rocky must see the faults of a younger Mickey and stay on path to become something better, not only for himself, but to help Mickey come full circle.\n\nAll in all, Rocky is not your average underdog, but a beautiful display of innovative cinematography, deep character analysis, and meaningful dialogue. This is a must see for all members of the family. It is a story that many can relate to. It's that shot of a life time that everyone wishes for, but not always get. This will keep you on the edge of your seat cheering for more. I give this movie two thumbs up and is a must own for all ages."

Telling the tale of a boxer with no direction who through mere luck gets a chance to face the reigning champ, Sylvester Stallone writes a powerful, if not a tad simplistic, story that went on to inspire millions.\n\nAlmost as surprising as the finale of the film is the fact that this film was of such high quality. The director, John G. Avildsen, was a competent film maker if nothing less. Although 'Rocky' was well directed, even winning Avildsen the Oscar, it became the one shining star in Avildsen's long career(and no, I do not count 'Karate Kid' nor 'Rocky 5').\n\nWhat made this film stand out was the the unique and very personal performances of its main characters. Burt Young got an Oscar nod for his wonderful performance as Paulie, Rocky's alcoholic yet very lovable buddy. Talia Shire, also receiving an Oscar nod, plays Paulie's overly shy sister who is behind some of the worst glasses I have ever laid my eyes on.\n\nAlthough she is a seemingly two dimensional character when she makes her first appearance, it soon becomes apparent that she has many dimensions to her character, most of which is revealed during her date with Rocky, who has had feelings for her for what seems to be a very substantial part of their lives.\n\nBut it is the titular character of Rocky who truly pushes this film up to greatness. Everything from his affectionately dopey stare to his wonderful pronunciation of words like \"yo\" and \"Adrian!\".\n\nEven after the twentieth viewing, 'Rocky' and it's main character never fail to grab you by the heart and brighten up your day, and maybe even your whole way of living.\n\n10 / 10\n\n--Rob"

Now with a chance of a life time, Rocky needs help from former boxer and trainer Mickey and the support of his girlfriend Adrian to rise up to the challenge and take the guts and glory. The film is a masterpiece as it has a very realistic feel to it, the acting is great, and the music is legendary as it makes the famous scene of Rocky running the steps seem even more epic, the movie is a definite must watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I first saw this movie I was quickly bitten by the ROCKY bug. I would soon be hooked on Rocky movies forever. I had to see every one not just once but over 100+ times. I am not exaggerating, every time a ROCKY movie is on TV I just have to watch it. I just got the DVD box set and I watch each movie over and over again. I really like the bonus footage. I also bought \"ROCKY\" the game for X BOX! Hands down the best boxing game I have ever played and probably ever will play until maybe they release another one down the road. I am from Pennsylvania and Philadelphia is only a quick drive away. I always try to visit the Philadelphia art museum and every run a few times up and down the ROCKY stairs! On top of the stairs there is a mold of his sneakers, really cool to see! I have even gone to the Spectrum a few times to get some pictures of the ROCKY STATUE. Oh yea and you can play as the ROCKY STATUE in the video game! You can also play as Mickey! I always look like a nut hanging from the ROCKY STATUE but oh well I am just ROCKY's biggest fan. Oh and if you visit Philadelphia go to PATS STAKES home of the best cheese steaks in the world you will see that Sylvester Stallone was there and you will see ROCKY's name engraved in the front sidewalk! Check it out! In conclusion, even though this was a fictional character these movies defiantly pull you into a boxer's life that went from rags to riches. I also like these movies because of the great training scenes. If someone had to ask me what was my favorite ROCKY movie, I would have to say it is tied between ROCKY I and ROCKY IV, but for the best training and sound track I would have to pick ROCKY IV! SURVIVOR is the best! I hope Sylvester Stallone and MGM gets together and agrees on good budget for ROCKY VI! I know there are millions of fans out there, not only within the United States but in other countries waiting for ROCKY VI! I will leave you all by saying \"YO ADRIAN I DID IT!\"\n\nThanks for reading my review!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The New York Times critic Vincent Canby dismissed \"Rocky\" as being \"pure 30s make-believe\" and being the intelligent, knowing critic that he was, he had a solid point in his review. I don't think there's a single person who has seen \"Rocky\" whether or not they enjoy it who would disagree with him. I don't even think the movie's makers, including writer/star Sylvester Stallone would strongly argue against that. It is sort of an old-fashioned tale about the underdog trying to become somebody in a moment that is really a scandalous motive for publicity. But as much as I admire and will always admire Mr. Canby as a critic and thinking man, I cannot agree with his overall verdict of \"Rocky.\" Sure it isn't exactly fresh material in terms of its plot, but I think it is more than fresh (even today) in the way that it unfolds itself.\n\n\"Rocky,\" which has five sequels and countless wanna-bes, set the standards for the underdog story which even today is still being followed almost religiously. You can even see references in Clint Eastwood's daringly different boxing saga \"Million Dollar Baby\" a film which is only slightly better than this one. Sylvester Stallone plays the titular character of Rocky: a goodhearted and world-wary boxer who is down-on-his-luck. He's got a talent, but no opportunity. That is until the world champion (Carl Weathers) needs a brand new opponent for his upcoming match. If his contender can beat him, he gains instant fame as the new world champion.\n\nBut there's more depth and more character involved in this story. \"Rocky\" is described as a Cinderella story and not only is it about hope for change and eventual success, but it's a sweet little love story too. Rocky's freshly-written romance is to a shy petshop cashier played by Talia Shire. He's also got an on-and-off friendship with her persistent brother (Burt Young) and a cantankerous old pro (Burgess Meredith). The movie's themes about striving for success also unfold when the depths of these characters are explored. Some of them are almost like leeches; they want to suck off of Rocky's moments of fame, even if he is destined to lose the match.\n\nThe movie really rests on the performance, however, by Sylvester Stallone and he never makes a wrong gesture. It's one of his two or three best roles in his career and if you ignore some dicey movies in the 80s and 90s, that's quite a showcase. Mr. Stallone plays his character sort of like a Rodney Dangerfield impersonation. He goes for laughs, as the character is oftentimes trying to entertain other characters with cheap jokes. His antics often fall flat for Talia Shire, but draws a broad grin upon the faces of the audience. Roger Ebert compared Stallone's performance to the early works by Marlon Brando and I think it's a performance that is just as memorable as those, and even the immortalizing ones that Brando did later on films such as \"The Godfather\" and \"Apocalypse Now.\" In other words, yes, I agree with Mr. Ebert.\n\nBut it *is* a movie about boxing...right? Well, that's just the excuse. That's the setup. A friend of mine once said that when he first saw \"Rocky\" as a boy, he hated it because he wanted to see the fights and couldn't have cared less about the love story or the relationships between the characters. Of course now as an adult, his opinion has vastly changed, but let's address the boxing scenes. They do work. In fact, they are very well-choreographed. I really appreciate how director John G. Avildsen avoided clich\u00e9s such as slow-motion and rotating shots. He set up many angles, like a television match, and filmed the scenes like that. Mr. Avildsen's directing is especially effective here and is more than competently done throughout.\n\nMany have tried to be what \"Rocky\" has become and most have failed. But it's not a shocker to most that this film has become the subject of such praise and imitation. It does have a very unique charm in its otherwise familiar setup and plot that allows it to work wonders on the audience's emotions. \"Rocky\" is one of the two or three best sports dramas I've ever seen and one incredibly entertaining motion picture. I've seen it many times and look forward the many times I will watch it again in the future."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Rocky\" is perhaps the definitive boxing movie. Sure, \"Raging Bull\" seems like the most obvious candidate but the boxing aspect in that film ultimately seems secondary to the interpersonal drama. As far as boxing movies go (or sports movies in general, for that matter) \"Rocky\" is a legitimate contender for the top spot.\n\nThe film tells the story of Rocky Balboa, a small time boxer who gets a once in a lifetime opportunity to face the heavyweight champ. The odds are stacked against him but he's committed to do what it takes to go the distance.\n\n\"Rocky\" was Sylvester Stallone's brainchild. He wrote the screenplay and he also ended up playing the title character. In the end, he was rewarded with Oscar nominations in both capacities. But he didn't do it alone.\n\nThe cast is a strong one. As mentioned, Sly nabbed an Oscar nomination but so did castmates Burgess Meredith, Burt Young & Talia Shire. While none of them walked away with an Oscar their nominations were all well deserved. And let's not forget Carl Weathers as Rocky's opponent, the flamboyant champ Apollo Creed.\n\nI admit that I was genuinely surprised by the quality of Sly's writing. The characterization is solid and the storyline nicely balances sports and romance. Perhaps most importantly, the script has the feel of authenticity. Throw in John G. Avildsen's Oscar-winning direction & the iconic Oscar-nominated song \"Gonna Fly Now\" and you've got an impressive combination of elements. So impressive, it turns out, that the film landed the Best Picture Oscar among some heady competition.\n\nI haven't seen any of the film's sequels and I probably never will since the IMDb user ratings seem to suggest a steady decline in quality. Nevertheless, regardless of what has followed for Stallone, the original \"Rocky\" still stands as a classic."

This movie also got the great action junkie Sylvester Stallone from a name nobody heard off to a Grade A actor.\n\nThis is about a poor, average boxer who is told that a heavyweight champion wants to fight him. So Rocky trains very hard in order to get ready for the heavyweight match.\n\nThe acting is very good. Sylvester is an underrated actor and he's been going for years including with the Expendables that came out this year.\n\nThis is a true American classic that's not all about boxing. There are a few themes here. And the score by Bill Conti is a memorable one. I rate this movie 9/10."

Sylvester Stallone wrote it while his acting career had slowly started becoming a dead-end, and he realized a story that reflected his own with Rocky \"The Italian Stallion\" Balboa, a promising small-time boxer that threw it all away and wanders the streets serving the local loan-shark as collector. Boxing champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) decides to face off an unknown in his New Year bout and picks Rocky, which gives the Italian Stallion one last shot at glory. What Stallone truly understood while writing this film, is that to make such a fairy-tale work he had to capture it realistically, and it had to be captured emotionally. He and director John G. Avildson managed both; the dirty streets and corners of Philadelphia paints Rocky's character along his tender romance with Adrian (Talia Shire), his relationship with her brother Paulie (Burt Young) and his own grizzled coach Mickey (Burgess Meredith). ROCKY stands tall alongside Scorsese's RAGING BULL (1980) as the best boxing- film of all time."

After winning her heart, Rocky's life will change forever when the world heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed offers him an opportunity to fight him for the world heavyweight championship. Rocky accepts the challenge and starts training with his grumpy, but lovable manager named Mickey. The fight soon arrives and Rocky must realize that his whole life is now a million to one shot and that he must go the distance to become a winner.\n\nWhen Rocky was released on November 21st, 1976, the world fell in love with the characters of this movie and the heart-warming love story about an ordinary man who takes his shot and fights to the end. The movie won three Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Editing. I still think that it deserved more than three awards out of ten, including awards for Stallone, Shire and Meredith. Rocky also revamped the image of the boxing movie bi giving it a new look that is still imitated to this day and also made Sylvester Stallone a major movie star. There are three things in this movie to watch for: the extraordinary script written by Sylvester Stallone, the score elegantly orchestrated by Bill Conti and finally, the final fight between Rocky and Apollo, which is one of the best boxing fights filmed to this day. If you like love stories, classic underdog stories or a good boxing story, you will love Rocky and will forever cherish it.\n\n10/10 EXCELLENT"

In my view, Rocky isn't just about a bum getting a shot at the title, but a story of friendship and hope. It isn't much of a boxing movie like Raging Bull, but it's a love story. A chick flick that the guys will like, because it's so strong. You feel for Rock when he yells at Mickey in his apartment. You feel Rocky's pain when he can't even run up those famous steps in Philly. The most powerful scene in the film, is the Gonna Fly Now segment. You really feel like Rocky is finally doing something about the abuse and people laughing behind his back. Rocky is one of those movies that make you smile at the end. It has touched people for so long and years to come."

        "review_detailed_main": "What makes a great film? Engaging characters, immersive story line, brilliant editing, fantastic music, an experience you can revisit again and again. Rocky has all of this and more.\n\nWhen it comes to performance I honestly do not know where Rocky starts and Sylvester Stallone ends. Stallone did not just play this character he conceived, created and crafted it. This is not method acting this goes way beyond that.\n\nWhat is this film about? Loneliness, love, self-respect, poverty, heartache, shyness, chance, pride, friendship, boxing? It is about life!\n\nRocky is a downtrodden character, in the words of Mickey (Burgess Meredith) Rocky is a bum, a loser, he had talent but never applied it. Rocky does not see this, he lives his life, he has some boxing skills which he puts to use in the occasional low-key cash fights and working as a money collector for the local crime lord. Rocky has the physical attributes for the debt collecting job but deep down he has a soft heart. He is not the smartest guy but ultimately he is a good guy.\n\nRocky is friends with Paulie (Burt Young) who is a deeply flawed character. Unlike Rocky he has a chip on his shoulder at life and the cards he has been dealt. Paulie has a sister Adrian (Talia Shire) that has not had an easy life either. She is painfully shy and introverted. Adrian works at the local pet shop which Rocky visits often. Rocky tries to make conversation and get to know her. The courtship between Adrian and Rocky is awkward at times but has a reality and sweetness that is undeniable. Rocky and Adrian eventually date.\n\nRocky's life is on a nowhere trajectory until out the blue his name is selected by Apollo Creed (Carl weathers) the heavy weight champion of the world as a publicity stunt. Apollo Creed wants to stage a boxing event where a lowly ranked amateur boxer gets a chance to fight for the title, \"The American dream\". Initially stunned and unwilling to take on this challenge, Rocky does not feel he is worthy or capable of this. Mickey eventually persuades Rocky to take this once in a lifetime chance. And so begins the rest of the film. Cue training montage.\n\nRocky works on many levels, that is why bit is such a fantastic film. The characters have a human naivety and poignancy that resonates. The editing and music are sublime in parts. It is a film I will watch again and again and appreciate more each time."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've seen Rocky on television a few times as a kid and it was a great boxing movie filled with so much emotion that it's still popular nearly thirty one years later.\n\nI've seen a few Sylvester Stallone movies and he brought such depth and emotion to the role of a small time boxer who got a shot at the big time. Supporting actress Talia Shire was perfect as Rocky's shy girlfriend who suddenly blossomed and believed in him.\n\nWhen the movie begins Rocky Balboa, (Stallone) is a 30 year old Philadelphia small time club boxer who makes a living fighting and collecting debt money for Gazzo (Spinell). During that time Rocky has befriended and fallen for Adrian (Shire) a pet shop clerk and sister of his friend Paulie (Young) who works at a meat packaging plant. When heavy weight boxing champion Apollo Creed (Weathers) sets up a fight and chooses Rocky as his opponent it's the opportunity of a lifetime for him to have a shot at the big time and go the distance. His old trainer Mickey (Meredith) is his manager who encourages him to go for his dreams. But can Rocky win this fight and keep his self respect.\n\nMy favorite scene is when Rocky begins kissing Adrian and she falls into his arms and welcomes the feeling back with a kiss. It was the most romantic and tender moment in the movie, for fans of wrestling I suggest you see this great classic you will enjoy."

        "review_detailed_main": "Before Stallone diluted the brand with a series of increasingly ridiculous sequels before finally bringing the franchise back to respectability with \"Rocky Balboa\" there was this little film which is a fine example of the Hollywood formula executed to perfection. The classic underdog tale combines the gritty realism of the 1970's, with the uplifting story of a down on his luck boxer who gets the chance of a lifetime when he gets a shot at the World Championship. At its core \"Rocky\" is really a touching love story and working class drama featuring great performances by all the principles (Stallone has never been better) and great direction by John G. Avildsen who won an Oscar for his work. Stallone's screenplay hits all the right notes and it is impossible not to be fully invested in the story by the time the emotional climax hits. There are scenes in this film that left their mark in film history and the film became an inspiration to people around the world. The only downside was that Stallone decided to cash in his characters popularity and made 5 sequels that had varying levels quality. Rocky 2 was entertaining but unnecessary, while Rocky 4 was so utterly ridiculous that the movie has become nothing but an entertaining joke. It's best to forget the sequels because the original is truly a classic example of Hollywood cinema at its absolute best."

With Incredible Training montage .\n\nROCKY has inspired a lot of viewers to face obstacles against insurmountable odds and is definitely a worthy film . As is the whole Series , . ROCKY has an ending that can go one of two ways , but nonetheless results in appreciation for the efforts of the underdog and the American Dream . Those that have seen it will never forget the inspirational and motivational music and is one of the all time best soundtracks that hears it will ever be able to forget !\n\nI gave it 9 out of 10 stars ."
