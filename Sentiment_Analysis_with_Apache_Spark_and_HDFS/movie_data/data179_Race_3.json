        "review_detailed_main": "While films like Parmanu, Padmavati, Padman, Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety , 102 Not Out, Hichki or even Blackmail were treat to eyes in the first half of 2018 giving hope that Bollywood movies have matured but then there comes a crap like Race 3 that will spoil your mood and you will wonder that if the makers are taking the audience for granted.\n\nRace 3 tells the story of a dispute between a family when Shamsher Singh (Anil Kapoor) decides to give half of his wealth to the adopted son, Sikander Singh (Salman Khan) and the rest of it between his own kids, Suraj (Saqeeb Saleem) and Sanjana (Daisy Shah).\n\nDirected by Remo D'Souza, who has made a decent film ABCD and pathetic ones like A Flying Jatt and ABCD 2, Race 3 is one hell of a journey which you wish to forget once you leave the theater. Right from the opening scene of the film to the climax, forget about logic, even the story is full of potholes. There is some breath of air when Anil Kapoor tells about his plan but again the film goes back to the loop hole and sadly does not recover. The first film Race (2008) was brilliant with solid twist and turns followed by an average Race 2 (2016). Race 3 is a nightmare which you should get over immediately with as it will haunt you, the more you think about it.\n\nNone of songs are good (surprisingly music is composed by brilliant duo Salim - Sulaiman). Action scenes , though few scenes were fine, but again gone overboard. Race 3 is high on production values and less on content. Dialogues are horrible and funny especially - Our business is our business , none of your business. Even the Bhojpuri language used in between the scenes is irritating.\n\nComing to the performances, none of the actors have done justice to their role. I do not understand why Salman Khan is repeating himself, even though he is in Bollywood industry for more than 25 years. The actor, who was superb in films like Dabanng and Sultan, should start experimenting with roles. Anil Kapoor is fine but could have been better. Bobby Deol makes a decent comeback but sadly not enough to leave any impact. Lesser spoken about Saqeeb Salim, Daisy Shah and Jacqueline Fernandez, the better.\n\nOverall, Race 3 is an insult to Bollywood. Avoid it any cost."

You'll also have your forever-35 y.o. Salman, who is 50+ in real life but will probably never ever grow up and get old on screen. Salman will poorly perform in dancing episodes, as usual. Maybe even worse than usual. You will have that awkward moment when a woman puts on jumpsuit for skydiving while driving a truck, and then skydives right from the truck. You will be impressed by Bobby Deol's 6-pack.\n\nYou'll get lost in plot twists within plot twists. Seriously, Mr. Nolan is silently jealously crying with his 'Inception' - 'Race 3' outraces it easily. Everything changes every 10 minutes or so - loyalties, family relationships, loves and hates.\n\nBefore the end Salman will do his thing again. He will rip his t-shirt from his well-oiled body with just 2 fingers. I mean, have you ever tried to rip a perfectly good t-shirt with one hand? I bet you failed. Salman does that every time successfully.\n\nIn the very end Salman will explain everything to those who didn't understand what just happened. You will definitely need that explanation.\n\nAs I said, this movie is so bad it is even good. Because the level of badness is so high, it is piece of the Art of Bad Movies."

Salman Khan is known for his stardom, fanbase, court cases except acting. Even his flops Jai Ho and Tubelight have crossed 1.1 billion mark at the box office. Race 3 is a movie which has been trolled the most than any other film of Salman or any other actor. Remo D'Souza was a very bad choice for big budget, multi starrer, action franchise. He is better off with dance related movies, A Flying Jatt was perfect lesson for him. Salman's involvement in Race Franchise, Questionable. Without giving any spoilers, and keeping the fact in mind that Race 3 is big budget movie sold to Distributors at very high price is really half baked, slow, illogical, bumpy and jerky roller coaster ride with hight production values. Good Cinematography, but Ayananka Bose had done better work before. Poor VFX, Prime Focus is good VFX company (see Bang Bang). Budget provided for VFX seems marginal. Performance are average. Music is letdown. Dialogues are wasted. Runtime is 159min too long. Too many songs. Even Abbas Mustan couldn't have pulled off this task (read weak script). They should have kept Saif Ali Khan (loyal to Race Franchise)."

And now, when 10s decade is At it's last phase, I feel, Salman Decided to work in a movie which would be an action family movie, so THE LENGENDARY Race 3.\n\nMovie takes the elements of both Races (1 & 2) and HSSH and shows it in the most pathetic and cringeworthy possible.\n\nElements:\n\nRace: Step-siblings, faking death etc\n\nRace 2: Heist, shades of antagonist\n\nHSSH: Joint family, problems between the siblings\n\nYou can say while carving the movie Race, the remaining wastage which was assembled together to make race 2 and the wastage of race 2 was assembled and wastage of HSSH was added to make race 3.\n\nPATHETIC, BORING, MINDLESS, PREDICTABLE AND CRINGWORTHY. These are just few words to honour the movie. Movie had some very pathetic performances, pathetic dialogues, pathetic songs with pathetic lyrics (Heeriye is a good number though) & pathetic storyline. The movie was too slow to be called entertaining, I didn't understand half of the story, no not because it had a very complex and out of the world story, just like that of Nolan's movies, but because I had a good sleep during the movie. Plus songs were so frequent and long that you can't help but sleep, so if you have trouble in sleeping or are insomniac. Please go for Race 3. It was an all and all Salman Khan movie, so I don't need to say how mindless it would be (But movies like tere naam, Saajan and Bajrangi Bhaijaan were way awesome). Twists were too damn predictable, Race series is known for amazing thrills and out of the world twists, but this one had none, yeah the last twist was good, but not amazing as that was also kind of predictable. The dialogues, the songs, the lyrics, the acting, the action scenes... everything about this movie was criminally cringeworthy.\n\nThe best thing about the movie was Bobby Deol and Anil Kapoor. Saif Ali Khan is missed badly and so is Abbas-Mastan.\n\nI request Ramesh Taurani, that if he is in a mood to make Race 4, please continue the Race 2 story and bring back Saif. Let Bobby be there, we have no problem.\n\nI've only one suggestion for you guys. There is a plethora of good movies, Avengers Infinity wars is still running in the theatres. Jurassic World is running. And if nothing, than please save your cash for Sanju, rather than watching this masterpiece of mud.\n\nIn my honest opinion, movies like Ek tha tiger, PRDP, Khiladi 786 and even loha and Gunda are like citizen Kane, Titanic, Godfather and the Shawshank redemption in front of this movie\n\nCompletely avoidable"

For Race-3 franchise, you do not expect an idiotic nonsensical movie. After all this is not Welcome or Heraferi franchise. Worst thing in this movie is Dialogues. A smart movie has dialogues where actors say few words, but those are very well polished. Overall, I think Remo should stop trying to be an all rounder, and should to things which he can do well.

He still cantcact and dance and certainly can not write lyrics. Now, movie is directed by desouza, who gave Flying jatt. I have one suggestion to him, 'he should stick to his dancing movies'.

Every single time your looking at the screen your surprised to see because every scene exceeds your expectations. The entry to the climax keeps u holding on to your chair. And their is nooo way to predict the climax. No one could even think the climax would be that good. The race is known for twists and turns which race 3 provides through out the movie and does it sooo good that your just amazed. The action is off the top. Each action scene is shot with perfection and has beaten Tiger Zinda Hai by a huge margin. Not one car is missing in this movie. You get to see everycsr you could think of. They literally destroyed everything they bought. Let's forget everything and focus on Salman Khan. He is the soul of the movie. He makes the movie so much better that you won't take your eyes off of him. His action sequences and his dialogue deliveries give you goosebumps. Most importantly when he takes of his shirt you will want to fall to the ground. The whole cast has done an amazing job. Bobby dell has made and amazing comeback and I can assure this movie will boost his career to the top once again. Anil Kapoor is at his best. He makes the movie feel so much more races because he's the only familiar face from all the races. Jacqueline looks as good as ever. Her action sequences are just mind blowing. Daisy shah on the other hand does a decent job but isn't showcased much. Saqib Saleem looks like a joke in the movie and looks too weak infront of salman and bobby. The music is really good but it doenst best race2 songs. Lat Lag Gaye has to be the best song from all the races. With race 3 they tried heeriye which was and awesome song and probably the best song of the movie but didn't feel better than Lat Lag Gaye. Apart from that we know that the other races have had some vulgarity but Salman Khan has done an excellent job taking out as much as he could. This movies makes for a family watch and it's as fun as it could get. It's for all ages and it will surely take away ur breathe in ever scene"

The movie doesn't look other than the regular family drama of Saas Bahu. The only difference is of the action scene and some songs.\n\nIts not the acting its the story which I'm very disappointed with. Do whatever you want in the movie and in the last scene give an explanation why you did, like seriously ?? Watching the movie and parsing it is to make fool of yourself. Movie is not worth watching. Chhota Bheem or Tom & Jerry are better than this.\n\nI don't want to give 1 star but the story is such a waste that I had to. Damn man when Bollywood is going to make good story movies."

        "review_detailed_main": "Race 3, an in-name-only third installment of a wildly successful franchise, has me thinking: Who let the filmmakers attach the name to this steaming pile of crap? It's not quite sure what it wants to be. Like a cross between a heavy-handed soap opera, a heist movie, an over-the-top musical extravaganza and a mindless Michael Bay blockbuster, complete with illogical explosions. By the end of the first extended action sequence, I wanted to tap out but I knew I wasn't getting a refund due to the use of MoviePass so I was in it for the long haul.\n\nClocking in at 160 minutes (standard for an Indian film), we are treated to about a minute of thanks credits before being quickly thrown into the squabbles of this wealthy dysfunctional family, the Singhs. The film gives us a narrative, describing each living member of the family with great detail, as if these characters already existed. It's like watching someone narrate Dallas.\n\nSince almost everyone in the film has more negative qualities than positive, this makes it hard to find someone to relate to. There is one who stands out, Sikander (Salman Khan, who also produces), as a sort of black sheep. Decent performances are given but they're all hindered by the writing, which adds something new on so often one can lose track. I see it as a bizarre parallel to my own work.\n\nI don't have much experience in Indian cinema. Only a few have crossed my path (Dr. Cabbie, Padmaavat and Aiyaary) but this one makes me question the future of my seeking out more. I know there are way better ones out there, and I'll find those.\n\nVisually, the film has a rather blatant abuse of slow motion effects. Even to the smallest of details. This may be due to my lack of viewing but there was a lot of jumping between Hindi and English, and subtitles for both sides. As well as a number of inconsistencies in the translation (some words come out spelled differently, words being capitalized strangely).\n\nDon't get me wrong. I love musicals (I saw The Greatest Showman five times and I embrace all kinds of different selections) but here, the over-the-top flashy theatrical musical numbers felt so out of place and very overlong.\n\nI'll have to seek out some Indian films with repute, and perhaps not go gung ho next time. If there is a Race 4 after this (rumor has it, there will be), I'm afraid I may have to steer clear. 0.5/5."

There are some unnecessary fight scenes too. Story is bit incomplete but it has a story.

Other actor has done just justice with their role. Daisy Shah and Jacqueline Fernandez have done brilliant action sequence than dialogue delivery. **Bobby Deol** has good supporting role. Anil Kapoor was less utilized. Saqib's role was not written well. Freddy has small role like Cameo. **Script:** There was no script at all, only action sequence without any logic and plot. Sometime Action thriller turn into family drama like Prem Ratan Dhan Payo. So many flaws in the story telling. **Action:** Action Sequences and Chase sequences were really breath taking. Fight between Daisy Shah and Jacqueline Fernandez was good one. **Cinematography:** This one is another good thing about Race 3 apart from Action sequences. **Ayananka Bose** has done a terrific camera work. **Music:** Race 3 has worst music of last 10 years of Salman Khan. There are lots of experiment done on music as there are many singers and lyricist for each song. Even Salman Khan has written 2 songs where Lulia has sing those songs as well. **Box-office:** It is expected to earn 30-35 crores on opening day. As word of mouth is negative so it will take 3-4 days to complete 100 crores Box-office collection. It will be really tough to cross 200 crores mark in Indian Box office. **Last Words:** Prevention is better than cure."

The movie has no connection to the race universe and therefore is not a true sequel.\n\nIn addition, the direction is very poor, the movie has no build up, no layering, no character development and having seem the previous films of the director I can only concluded that he should quit direction as it is not his cup of tea."

All the other characters are one note except Anil Kapoor who seems to enjoy killing people on screen and having a gala time. As it turns out the most meme worthy moment of the film is not Daisy Shah going \" Our business is our business none of your business\" it's actually Saqib Saleem adding 'bro' at the end of every sentence. Being one of the young adults out there let me say it for the record that WE DON'T TALK LIKE THAT. The problem with Race 3 is that you cannot make a film just to show case the super-stardom of your lead actor I thought that we had stopped making such films."

By the way, the action scenes in this movie may indeed be the worst of any of Salman's \"magic masala\" action flicks. This movie seems more like a trailer than an actual cinematic piece. It's plot is virtually non-existent considering the incessant attempts to just thwart the reader's each and every prediction on what happens next. Remo D'Souza has gone out of control here. Anil Kapoor is a relief to see on screen, but other than that and the occasional eye-catcher, everything else is a blurry, poorly envisioned, excuse for a fusion of Hum Saath Saath Hain and The Fast and the Furious.

Also, the lead role dying and coming back needs to stop in the Race franchise, it's happened in every movie.\n\nThe movie doesn't have any good action sequence either to qualify for action genre, this movie is a family drama.\n\nThis movie is for kids who wishes to see some fancy cars and a tourism ad for the United Arab Emirates."

With a pathetically low score of only 2.1, it really is a film that few people have loved! Will I be yet another person who thinks this is an absolutely terrible film??\n\nYes. I thought the film was terrible as well and for two big reasons. First, the entire story is about a family of monsters. Don't get the wrong idea, they aren't literally monsters but rich folks who are arms merchants who will sell to ANYONE and who are all lethal killing machines. The father built up the company and apparently trained his twin son and daughter to be self-absorbed murder machines as well as his adopted son. During the course of the movie, they murder dozens and dozens--with an ease that would scare away the Terminator and they look as if they just walked off the cover of 'Vogue\" or \"GQ\"!! They are simply evil scum...and the movie seems to romanticize them and it's also really hard to care about anyone in the film. Second, the film is over-stylized to the point that it was ridiculous. The fights were downright silly--with too much slo-mo, mid-air spins, bullets having no effect on any of them and all while wearing the most stylish fashions. It seemed silly...really silly...especially when one of them literally jumped from thousands of feet to join in the fight while wearing a bat-like suit and then crashing into the warehouse. He and his sibs then wiped out a veritable army of well armed soldiers...and none of them broke a sweat nor got injured!! I really wish instead they had spent less time and money in making these ridiculous fight scenes and simply filmed them as if the leads were humans and not gods!! It was simply ludicrous...and seemed almost like watching the Kardashians starring in a super-over stylized Bond film!! Laughable to say the least.\n\nI lay all the blame for me hating this movie on the director and producers. They never showed ANY restraint and should have dialed back on the crazy super-human aspects of the movie as well as the constant blaring music and super-wealthy locations and costumes. None of them seemed to wonder if they were creating a film that was less an entertaining drama and more an unintentional but unlikable comedy. Oh, and I didn't even mention the song and dance numbers. They ARE common in Indian pictures...but the amount of auto-tuning they did make for some weird techno-sounding singing....though the dancing itself was pretty typical for Bollywood.\n\nRarely have I seen this much money spent to create a film this dumb.\n\n3 out of 7 found this helpful."

I am not a hater of Salman Khan, I am a hater of horrible movies. Tiger Zinda Hai was pretty good, but this one proved to be horrible.\n\nFor making a sensible and watchable movie we need a proper storyline (I doubt, whether Race 3 had any) a set of actors who can act (I need a microscope to find one out there) and songs which we could hum for a couple of days (Let's not talk anymore about the songs, because I cannot find a single thing to appreciate about them, I mean, none of them are worth hearing twice).\n\nHow can we forget the \"meme - worthy\" dialogues and the \"beautiful\" lyrics written by the megastar Salman Khan?!\n\n\"Our business is our business, none of your business\". \"Ik baar baby selfish hoke apne liye jiyo na.\"\n\nNow let's talk about the previous two movies of the Race series: -Race was absolutely brilliant, let's say it proves \"Old is Gold\". Race 2 was my favourite. Race is Saif Ali Khan's and it will only be his. Race without Saif, Dabangg without Salman and Dhoom without Hrithik is meaningless. Believe me, save your money. Please don't waste it on Race 3.\n\nInstead, watch Sanju on 29th June. Practically, there is nothing good about this movie except the beautiful cars shown flying. Salman here is a cluless stuntsman. Now, he should realise that stardom does not make a movie, a proper storyline and fine acting makes one.\n\nI would rate this movie 1 out of 10.\n\nRatings of the songs: -\n\n(1) Heeriye: 1.5 out of 5 (2) Selfish: 0.5 out of 5 (3) Allah Duhaai Hai: 2.5 out of 5 (4) Party Chale On: 0.5 out of 5\n\nOverall: Horrible (1 out of 5)\n\nRating: -\n\nDirection: 0.5/5 Dialogues: 0.5/5 Screenplay: 0.5/ 5 Music: 1.0 / 5 Action: 2.0 / 5 Visual appeal: 1.5 / 5\n\nOverall: Disaster (1.0 out of 5)\n\nBox office prediction: - (Lifetime) 200 to 220 crores in India because I know that even after saying this much, insensible Salman fans will go and watch this movie and make this crap a blockbuster.\n\nThat's my review for Race 3."

The Mastan bro's at least know how to make an action movie and if a twist is required how to place it. In this addition of Race there is more than one twist, every character is having a twist and in the end movie is complete disaster and nothing else. One of the villains, as there are so many, having two female body guards who are displayed everything else in the movie but body guards. Over use of cars for no reason at all, guns and heli's and fights are simply stupid. Lastly, as always topless fight of Salman Khan is there. Daisy shah highly unimpressive, Anil Kapoor Wasted and Remo D'Souza stick with dances please. This is not your thing. Jacqueline Fernandez, lara croft outfit in the end, STUPID."

        "review_detailed_main": "A successful franchise,huge star cast, holiday release and SALMAN KHAN. \"Race 3\" has all the ingredients to make a perfect blockbuster masala entertainer and hopes to be Salman Khan's 4th entrant into the coveted 300 cr club. So does the 3rd film in the \"Race\" series match up to its predessors and the hype generated?. Lets find out.\n\nStory: First of all, there is no story to review so this section should have been left blank. There is literally no plot, the characters are flat and one dimensional, there is no conflict, while watching the film I was wondering whether the person who wrote the film has any knowledge of basic storytelling or any sense of creativity. The dialouges are cring-worthy and it seems they were written by a 4th grader. The plot twists which are a trademark of the Race franchise are predictable and plain stupid.Even the most loyal of Salman Khan fans will find it hard to digest this joke of a screenplay which is lost in this 130 crore disaster of a film.\n\nDirection,Editing,Production: I think Remo D Souza should just stick to being a choreographer as Direction is clearly not his cup of tea. His take of the Race series is a huge downgrade from that of Abbas-Mustan who gave the Race series its own trademark feel. The intelligent story telling of Abbas Mustan is clearly missing.You know a disaster is bound to happen when you give a below average director, a weak script and thats exactly what happened. The production design and Cinematography is top notch and slick which gives the film a stylish look.\n\nActing: Even an AI Robot can offer more expressions and better dialouge delivery than Salman Khan in this film. Salman Khan's casting is a complete misfit and you will definitely miss the suave Ranveer Singh played by Saif Ali Khan. Salman Khan comes out as a sore thumb and its pretty evident that he just sleep walked through the film. Unfortunately, Bobby Deol has made a forgettable comeback and he has again proved that he simply cant act. Daisy Shah and Jacquline Fernandes have simply been cast to up the glamour quotient of the film. Even a talented actor like Saqib Saleem is wasted. Only Anil Kapoor's performance is the sole saving grace of the film and he has done a commendable job given the pathetic script he was given to act for.\n\nMusic: This has to be one of the most ridiculous soundtracks of all time. Each and every song is just plain bad with even worse lyrics. The Allah Duhai hai theme song is the only hummable track in this disaster of an album.\n\nUnderline: No style and No substance. The film has clearly lost the race against its predessors and even a stupid Race 2 looks like Inception in front of this film.The only race this film wins is for \"worst movie of the year\" and its just June."

The highlights of the film I would say is the never seen actions which are picturized at grand scale.\n\nSalman is top notch, Anil Kapoor is pitch perfect in the film and most importantly, #Remo D'Souza surprises you with his sharpe direction.\n\nBecause I liked it very much and enjoyed it a lot, I give it 10/10. Go and watch it even if you are not a traditional Bollywood movie goer or Salman Khan. It will entertain you a lot and you will have a great day a great weekend discussing every bit of the film.\n\nRace3 will be a blockbuster film. My business rating for the weekend in India is 125 crores becoming the highest grossing weekend and 330 to 350 crore lifetime in India and $25-30Million in overseas.\n\nI watched it in 3D and it was another experience altogether. It is a clean family film with no embarrassing moment."

Direction: Remo D'Souza is by far the worst director for the race series. He's just blown as many cars as he could and tried to show the lead actors ripped and thought it would make a great movie. Music: Awful, awful, awful!!!! No better words to describe. This is perhaps the worst compilation of songs in a film ever.

Right from the opening scene of the film to the climax, forget about logic, even the story is full of potholes. There is some breath of air when Anil Kapoor tells about his plan but again the film goes back to the loop hole and sadly does not recover. The first film Race (2008) was brilliant with solid twist and turns followed by an average Race 2 (2016). Race 3 is a nightmare which you should get over immediately with as it will haunt you, the more you think about it.\n\nNone of songs are good (surprisingly music is composed by brilliant duo Salim - Sulaiman). Action scenes , though few scenes were fine, but again gone overboard. Race 3 is high on production values and less on content. Dialogues are horrible and funny especially - Our business is our business , none of your business. Even the Bhojpuri language used in between the scenes is irritating.\n\nComing to the performances, none of the actors have done justice to their role. I do not understand why Salman Khan is repeating himself, even though he is in Bollywood industry for more than 25 years. The actor, who was superb in films like Dabanng and Sultan, should start experimenting with roles. Anil Kapoor is fine but could have been better. Bobby Deol makes a decent comeback but sadly not enough to leave any impact. Lesser spoken about Saqeeb Salim, Daisy Shah and Jacqueline Fernandez, the better.\n\nOverall, Race 3 is an insult to Bollywood. Avoid it any cost."

The significant job of any actor should be only Acting nothing beyond that and Salman Khan is one of those who actually doesn't know any kind of Acting. Public should be clever enough to judge which kind of movies to watch. This movie franchisee in any way is worst and don't resemble anything which adds value or form of entertainment to the society.

        "review_detailed_main": "Race 3 is an action thriller film directed by Remo D'Souza and produced under Salman Khan Films. The film stars Anil Kapoor, Salman Khan, and Bobby Deol in the prominent roles. It is the third installment of Race film series.\n\nAs per the story is considered the film has no connection to its previous installments. It is the standalone film which revolves around a 'Singh' family that deals in worldwide arms dealings and crimes. Shamsher Singh (Anil Kapoor), the head of the family, a ruthless boss, runs this business with his twin children Sanjana (Daisy Shah) and Suraj (Saqib Saleem), and his nephew Sikander (Salman Khan). Being older among these siblings, Sikander always gets all the work delegated to him and gets all the appreciation from Shamsher, which eventually makes Sanjana and Suraj feel envious and jealous against Sikander. Bobby Deol plays the role of Yash, a loyal and dangerous henchman of a 'Singh' family. And Jacqueline Fernandez plays the role of Jessica, a woman with secrets, and Sikander's love interest. What follows next in the film is a game of love, deception, greed, and revenge.\n\nFirst of all, the absence of Saif Ali Khan from the film totally takes away the feel of previous Race films. The film is the unwanted and unnecessary installment in the Race film series. The film is filled with a nonsensical storyline, a lot of plot holes, totally useless songs, some over the top action sequences, shirtless Salman Khan, and yes, shirtless Bobby Deol as well. Jacqueline and Daisy are just the eye candies in the film. There is nothing notable in the film, except the climax of the film and Anil Kapoor's performance. The film is a polished hyper-realistic dumb film. It's just like overpriced petrol where filmmakers are literally looting audience.\n\nVerdict : Does not even worth a single watch. Watch it at your own risk."

The highlights of the film I would say is the never seen actions which are picturized at grand scale.\n\nSalman is top notch, Anil Kapoor is pitch perfect in the film and most importantly, #Remo D'Souza surprises you with his sharpe direction.\n\nBecause I liked it very much and enjoyed it a lot, I give it 10/10. Go and watch it even if you are not a traditional Bollywood movie goer or Salman Khan. It will entertain you a lot and you will have a great day a great weekend discussing every bit of the film.\n\nRace3 will be a blockbuster film. My business rating for the weekend in India is 125 crores becoming the highest grossing weekend and 330 to 350 crore lifetime in India and $25-30Million in overseas.\n\nI watched it in 3D and it was another experience altogether. It is a clean family film with no embarrassing moment. Excellent movie RACE 3."

I somehow gathered all my strength and patience to watch this despite bad reviews, on Amazon prime videos, and thanks to them, I didn't have to waste money to suffer this cringe fest.\n\nRace 3 is 2 1/2 hours of human embarrassment. Basically a launch party, trying to introduce new faces(or more accurately, feces) in Bollywood under the banner of Salman Khan. It seriously makes me question the mentality of public, who went out in droves to watch this pile of crap.\n\nAction scenes are complete disgrace to the brand of action movies. Trying to copy some of the best scenes from other movies, and failing in each of them with flying colors. No one knows how to properly make green screen CGI. I mean even small youtubers are making movie quality CGI with way less resources.\n\nAll in all, if you are feeling a bit depressed, go watch this movie, you'll fell better knowing you can act better and write better stories. Oh wait, you might get more depressed knowing this movie made 280cr while you drag your ass to work everyday to make ends meet. Ciao!"

But this movie is totally unbearable, awful songs, cringey dialogues, too many plot holes, too much action that will gave you headache and acting is worse actors like Anil Kapoor couldn't save this movie and the supporting cast were also awful and Freddy Daruwala hasn't any thing to do in this film.

It was like they are changing their minds rather than making sure they know who's side they are on.\n\nThe action was the only thing that saved the movie but some it is was cheesy and the first wing suit stunt looked faker than a PS1 game.\n\nIt was good to see Bobby Deol back which is what I liked about it and you can tell that he was well prepared for the role after a long come back.\n\nThe songs were not only bad but was a huge misfit for this kind of movie, probably for any Bollywood movie as they were mostly romantic songs and this is supposed to be an action thriller. The songs were a total waste and appeared every 10 minutes.\n\nIf there is anything that I learned from this movie is that if anyone betrays you then you should sing a song to them, I talking about the Allah Duhai Hai song.\n\nOverall this is nothing more than a time-pass movie if your not a Salman Khan fan."

        "review_detailed_main": "I understand the humungous fan following Salman has so no wonder this movie will be a major Box office hit, raking in the moolah and breaking records as well, despite of that I will write my review here.\n\nSalman's acting (or lack thereof) is blatantly visible in this movie. I think earlier he used to try (at leats), now he doesn't even bother. An actor is supposed to be the character but here, his persona outshines and overshadows the character or even the story. Saqib Salim who is a decent actor made to say the word \"bro\" after each and every dialogue so much so that it becomes cringeworthy. Bobby Deol is average, Daisy, Jacquline are... like they are in their other movies - all glam no skill. Anil Kapoor is the only one who can hold his own.\n\nThe plot is contrived (which was true for earlier Race movies too) but this movie doesn't even put any effort. Be it pulling off a supposedly dangerous heist which is wrapped up in a song sequence with the actors just walking in slow motion to look cool. At least some effort should have been shown- some action scene, some nail-biting suspense but we get nothing. All the maker focussed on was getting Salman, getting the other actors to walk in slo-mo to look cool and blowing up expensive cars.\n\nThe songs... I don't even know where to begin. I was shocked that a big-budget movie couldn't even afford a decent lyricist till I saw that Salman has penned a couple of the songs himself. Just do a quick google search of Selfish and I found love - 2 \"gems\". Even the title track has been mashed and made bad.\n\nI thought Race 1 was okay, Race 2 was going downhill but still bearable but Race 3 just touches the bottom of it. Non-existent story-lines, bad acting, \"star\" kids etc is what Bollywood has been reduced to now."

        "review_detailed_main": "Race 3 is a film directed by Remo D'Souza. I am one of the few people who was impressed by the trailer and was hopeful that this film was going to be a sheer blockbuster. But then the promotions of the film started that reduced my interest in the film. After watching the film yesterday, I can say that I have watched the worst film anyone could make.\n\nPlot: Things suddenly begin to change for the Singh family when Jessica Gomes enters their lives.\n\nStory and direction: I remember in 2008 when the first instalment came out and me being quite excited when no one talked about the film. The film surprised everyone and subsequently a sequel came out in 2013 which was not as good as its predecessor. But still the film worked for its convincing plot and setting. Let me get one thing straight. This film had the makings of a blockbuster. The set pieces of the film looked quite awesome and set the screens to be blazing on film. But alas, that's where the excitement stops. The plot is so weak and paper thin that it couldn't invest me for a second. There were so many things that the makers packed into this film that it felt irritating after some time. Watching the film, I felt that given a director's job I could have done a better job. Remo D'Souza just spoils the whole film. He just tries every formula in the book without giving his own input that would make the film standout in comparison to others. Many scenes felt so impossible that I wondered how the writer thought of putting it in the script (if there was one). The dialogues were already trolled even before the film released but I can say there are plenty more. Not as a Salman Khan fan, I was disappointed more as an action film fan. The stunts looked so amateurish (considering a Hollywood action director was hired). There was a lot of green screen and stunts dumbed down for the Indian audiences. Even I could know the difference between the actors and their stunt doubles. Slow motion has been used a lot which negated the possible effect the scene should have.\n\nPerformances: Anil Kapoor was top notch and maybe the possible reason why this film was still bearable. Salman Khan was his usual. We know Jacqueline's acting skills and as to why she is taken in films. Bobby Deol basically does nothing in the film. Daisy Shah was horrible. Saqib Saleem and Rajesh Sharma were wasted. Sharat Saxena did good with what was given.\n\nMusic: Salman Khan, who is known for providing chartbusters, fails miserably in this department. None of the songs felt natural or good. It felt like they were compensating for the lack of story. If I had to pick out the worst song it would be the Salman Khan written and performed song 'I Found Love'. Salman Khan should stop writing songs after this experience and stop taking Iulia Vantur to sing songs. The BGM works in places but I have heard better.\n\nWorst Scene: It would be any scene where Anil Kapoor and any other character converse in Bhojpuri. It felt very forced and funny. The dialogues were full of trash.\n\nVerdict: Salman Khan should have thought even before investing a huge amount in a film like this. If that wasn't enough, he hired Remo as the director (we all know what happened with FLYING JATT). The makers have announced a sequel to this film. Hopefully they understand what they are doing. RACE 3 was more a comedy film than an action thriller. It is the worst film this franchise has to offer.\n\nI am going with a 2/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "PLOT: This film too, like its predecessors, has an ensemble cast. Characters involved - Rich, old illegal arms dealer (Anil Kapoor), his step son (Salman Khan), his twins (Daisy Shah and Saqib Saleem), the family's Man Friday (Bobby Deol) and the eye candy (Jacqueline Fernandez).\n\nIllegal arms dealer has been wrongly driven out of his country and his sole aim is to return to his native village with a clean chit and to do this he needs to indulge in more criminal activity such as stealing a 'hard disk' that has illegally recorded sleazy videos of politicians and then blackmailing these politicians. To help him with this task, he has his children who are all trained fighters and have each others' backs on the field. But all is not well at home. The twins want the step son out of the way as their father favours him over them. Step son has brief affair with eye candy and then they break up only to have her return back to his life after few days/months/years (we don't know). Man Friday oscillates in his loyalty towards step son and twins.\n\nWill illegal arms dealer return to his village? Will arm candy and step son have a 'happily ever after'? Whom does Man Friday finally stand up for? Who will survive- the twins or the step son?\n\nOh Salman, you've ruined this movie and turned into a big-budget Dabangg! The film begins with each character being introduced by a voice over and that is when things begin to go downhill. When you have someone do a voice over in the film, that person ought to have a great voice and not sound like a railway announcement.\n\nThe USP of the Race series has always been the action packed scenes, the larger than life stunt sequences and the twists in the plot. Race 3 has all of this but fails to impress due to poor acting, even worse direction, abysmal script and unrealistic scenes. I am fine with one person taking down an entire truckload of trained militia by himself but how in God's name does Salman manage to jump off a high rise building in a wingsuit, manoeuvre through buildings across town (while still flying) and land into the warehouse where his siblings are fighting? I have never been a big fan of Salman's movies but this one really annoyed me as I went to the theatre with high expectations.\n\nSalman looks like a stocky potato and lacks the panache that Saif Ali Khan had in the previous movies.\n\nI feel terrible saying this but Daisy Shah is really annoying. Despite her cool stunt moves and her brilliant aerial dance, she has failed at trying to pass off as an uber cool, 25 year old scheming daredevil.\n\nJacqueline is just being umm.... Jacqueline in the movie. (Chittiyan kalaiyan veh)\n\nHowever, feminists rejoice. For a change, this film has action scenes with women in them, that do not involve name calling and hair pulling. *eye roll*\n\nWould you believe this, I have nothing bad to say about Bobby Deol!\n\n(Oh, I forgot to mention the other twin. Yeah, he has some scenes too.)\n\nAnil Kapoor was definitely the saving grace and the good news is that the way the film ended, it would appear that Anil Kapoor shall make a comeback and thankfully not Salman Khan!\n\nI sometimes still croon the songs from Race 1. The songs in this movie are unremarkable and the lyrics are so lame (tried thinking of a more professional word than lame, but lame describes it the best) especially the song \"Selfish\" and what do you know! The lyrics to the song have been penned by Salman!\n\nDid I mention the script? LAME. Remo, please stick to being a choreographer. P.S: Remo D'Souza is the director of the movie."

Even if there are flop movies, the songs were good. But this film doesn't have any of the qualities mentioned above.in half of the film , I feel asleep. Why not fall asleep? Because the movie was boring with very dull acting. Didn't expect this Salman Khan. Although I am not a big fan of him, I enjoyed some of his old movies like hum aapke hain Kuan , sultan and so on. This is just crap! No climax, no emotions, no passion. Just the people came to do whatever they had to do and say GOOD NIGHT. Just one advice: don't watch this movie"

Anil Kapoor : Plays Shamsher Singh, the weapon manufacturer, who holds up the Singh empire. Anil as we all know, is like fine wine, turns better with time. Bobby Deol : He plays Yash, Sikander's right hand. Bobby Deol is back with a bang, and gives an impressive comeback. Saqib Salim, Daisy Shah and Jacqueline Fernandez were suitable in their respective roles.\n\nPLOT Being the 3rd installment of the Race series, Race 3 doesn't really impress. The storyline is basically about family rivalry, but choreographer turned Director Remo D'Souza doesn't execute it well. Abbas Mustan definitely did better direction in the first 2 movies.\n\nSOUNDTRACK Unlike Race & Race 2, the tracks of Race 3 are a mess. Only the theme song Allah Duhai Hai is impressive."

        "review_detailed_main": "Race 3 was released on 15th June 2018 and is a thriller film directed by Remo D'Souza and produced under Tips Films and Salman Khan films. It is distributed by Tips films, Salman Khan Films, and Yash Raj Films. This film is considered to be a reboot to the race franchise. Although it has a sparsely related plot to the previous film. This film stars Anil Kapoor and Jacqueline Fernandez who have previously performed in this franchise and Salman Khan Bobby Deol, Saqib Saleem, and Daisy Shah as the new entrants in the franchise. This is the presently last and the worst part in my view in the whole franchise and I primarily think that the failure of this film is due to Salman Khan because he interferes in every sphere of filmmaking whether it be the direction or it is a screenplay. The story has become a thing of past in Salman Khan films and as I say that story is the core of any movie and so I give this film a very negative rating. This film lags in the storyline as well as in the presentation too. individual performances of actors are fine and the music is also average. I don't advise my readers to watch this movie as it could lead to severe headaches."

        "review_detailed_main": "Race 3 Movie Review by #SaltedPopcorn\n\nIt's a general phenomena that Salman Khan fans love Salman Khan movies even when he literally craps in his movies. But Race 3 is a movie which, even Salman Khan fans would not be able to endure.\n\nRace franchise has suffered a lot after its first part. Race 2 was a bit worse than Race and Race 3 is an utter nonsense movie with king of Nonsense himself Salman Khan. Thanks to Salman Khan And Remo D Soua for spoiling and devastating this franchise completely. Race 3 is story of a family headed by Anil Kapoor and is involved in manufacturing of Arms. Salman, Daisy Shah, Saqeeb Salim and Bobby Deol are part of this family. Though all of them try to act smarter than each other, in reality, every one's character is even more stupid than others.\n\nRace 3 is a no script, no acting, no common sense movie. Which character is with whom and what does every character want, it's beyond understanding till end of the movie.\n\nDirector Remo D Souza should know that he has disastrous direction skills. He is better being a judge is some kids Dance show rather than giving headaches to people by making F.A.L.T.U movies like ABCD, ABCD 2 and many other failed immature films.\n\nRace 3 is an amateur attempt to put some glamour and action into a boring script. It's overridden by overacting. In every 10 minutes, songs keep breaking the script (whatsoever is there). This Race lasts so long that people start leaving theater on the first chance they get.\n\nOverall, this movie should be strictly avoided not only in theaters but at home also. It's not a race of being smarter, it's a race of being stupid. More than Race, it's Disgrace.\n\nSpend your time either at home or watch Jurassic Park again. There, Dinosaurs have acted better than this bunch of actors.\n\nSaif, I dint know you could also be missed so much in some movie. Race was outrightly yours and must be yours.\n\nStars- 1.5/5"

From poorly written dialogue to nonsensical plot twists, this movie is a prime example of how not to make a Bollywood action thriller. The performances are lackluster, with even the usually reliable Salman Khan failing to save this train wreck. The action sequences are over-the-top and cartoonish, and the attempts at humor fall flat. Overall, Race 3 is a forgettable film that should be avoided at all cost Review: \"Race 3 is a cinematic catastrophe that defies logic and coherence at every turn. With a plot thinner than tissue paper and characters shallower than puddles, this film fails to engage on any level. Salman Khan's charisma alone cannot salvage the train wreck of lazy writing, wooden acting, and cringe-worthy dialogue. The action sequences are so ludicrously staged that they border on parody, and the attempts at emotional depth are laughable. Race 3 is a cinematic black hole, sucking away two and a half hours of your life that you'll never get back.\""

A movie especially one that is in the race trilogy should have been meticulously thought out and instead salman khan has just tried to show the world he has all the cars and power he wants, and its a clear portrayal of him trying to emphasize his power in bollywood, and unfortunatley it has all backfired and these reviews are evidence of that. Its sad to see so much money wasted on a movie that should have been the third and lucky movie in the franchise of race, it should have overturned the most of all the movies and instead its truly shocking lol. too much money not enough brains."

The acting is so awkward including sallu bhai and this is being said by a die hard fan of salman khan. There are two integral characters in the film which were portrayed by Oscar deserving actors namely Daisy shah and I dont even know the name of that guy who potrayed the characters so bad it almost makes Laugh out Loud every time they start trying to act. Music is right up there on the horrific scale and the lyrics are such a pain to the brain, they literally make no sense. What surprised me more was the choreography. One of the topmost choreographers of the country is directing the film and the innovation or freshness you expect in the choreography is non existent. The direction was anyways even worse than the horrible choreography. The production values are ok and bad when you compare to the budget they had in hand. In one sentence this is a film which doesnt deserve anyone's time and if you still plan to watch it get ready for the guide to how not to direct a film."

Remo D'Souza did a very very bad job making this film. This film didn't even had a good story but in fact it was incredibly bad. At least Flying Jatt was a little bit better than this one but the direction stays the same for these films. Salman Khan's acting was so bad that you will not believe that he'll do this type of acting. Jacqueline was totally not needed in this movie and so is the other actors and actresses like Bobby Deol, Daisy Shah and Saqib Saleem. The only good thing about this movie was Anil Kapoor as how his character was more focused than anyone elses. Let's talk about the action in this movie. The action was very bad because it won't look as realistic as how Race 2's action sequences was. But then again it was also pointless. Also I think that this is one of the worst films of Salman Khan. And I also don't get why he would do these types of films.\n\nAnyways I would give this movie a 4/10 because I think that this movie showed that it is going to be bad from the trailer and the then movie itself was very bad compared to the trailer."

First of all the original directors should have never been replaced, they are what makes Race franchise a successful one, if you look at the previous works they own this genre of suspense and thrillers. Although Race 2 was a little behind the original Race in film making, it stills stands out minus the fashion show.\n\nThis Race 3 has the elements and potential but is made for all the wrong reasons namely Salman Khans showcase. He is an entertaining actor no doubt and I like his movies but this was a wrong move that killed the Race franchise. Race is all about the thrilling ride and the shocking twist of betrayal, however Race 3 falls flat in this department, its reveal and twist isnt shocking and everything was just messed up. The ideas were there but it couldnt be woven in its screenplay, the director seem not to know where he going with this movie. It gets too messy and the events during the film does not tie up fully at the end.\n\nThe rest of the cast are just there to add more confusion and bad acting. Anil Kapoor is decent and Salman is just average, seen better films of his. Jacqueline is just there for sake of having a beautiful actress in the film with no meaty parts, Daisy is average and Saqeeb is irritating. A good actor like Bobby Deol is wasted.\n\nMusic was below par compared to other 2 films but still enjoyable. For a big budget film better looking locations should have been used. Nevertheless it is still a movie that has good action scenes and maybe enjoy if you ignore all the flaws and potholes in the story and the below average script and actors."

        "review_detailed_main": "Race 3 can only be described as 'uggh'. The movie limped and wallowed from the very beginning and never really got off. It was an attempt at a masala movie with some poorly executed acting, direction and storyline. The storyline infact was altogether missing.\n\nRace has been a solid franchise delivering 2 thrilling fast paced action movies, backed by slick editing and well crafted action and dance sequence. This movie is unlike the others at best a disgrace to the franchise. The action sequences are a bore, cliched, trite scenes.\n\nThe star cast seems wasted and the impressive balance between the hero and goons which was the underpinning of the Race series, completely missing. Veteran actors with salt grey hair are being paired with absolute novices, making it seem fake and dubious. The dialogues and song sequences are absolutely shallow, a lazy concoction of english and hindi with little thought or consideration to meaning.\n\nBut more than anything the movie sinks because of poor and inattentive direction. Remo lives up to his talent of vomitting shoddy, half baked, cliched movies to audiences. Fast paced action sequences are immediately followed by absolutely slow listless songs, making it seem like bumpy edits with no continuation. Storyline was probably trashed long before the shoot and impulsive, knee-jerk shoots were knit together to create a semblance of a storyline.\n\nBut the true artistic talent is revealed in corporate sponsorships with Marriot, Dell and many other tobacco companies finding mention and feature.\n\nOverall, its sad to see A Grade actors concurring to work in such a movie. It is doled to audiences, in a brazen manner, ridiculing and deriding their intellect. Suggestive that audience only merit such movies and will wallow it up in favor of big star cast."

The doctor asked what I had been doing before my headaches started. I told him I was watching Salman's best film to date, Race 3. \"Go figures,\" he said. He handed me the results.

Peace can be made even among fatal enemies if we want to do it with Positive thinking and positive heart. Thats why in Climax of movie he made peace with the enemy. Thats why we call Salman Khan Being Human ( A man with Golden heart). His movies can be watched by little one, elders, youngsters. It does not contain vulgarity. I watched this movie again today and found this good point in the movie. This is the reason people in overseas markets who miss their family and dear ones a lot while living away from India, Pakistan and other Countries are liking this movie a lot. Lets try to make peace and remove grudges against the people with which we are not in good terms. Lets watch this move again and again. Make it a Block Buster movie of the year 2018. Weekend is coming lets share this message again and again. And lets watch this movie again and set new records for Race 3."

Audiences got confused whether they are watching race 3 or prem ratan dhan payo. Race 3 lacks of that race series feel . Though race 3 talks about so much of family. It fails to connect with family. Saif Ali Khan should be in place of Salman Khan. As Salman is not suitable for suspense thriller . As suspense thriller shows sometime protagonists as antagonist. So Saif Ali Khan should have been in place of Salman Khan. Bobby deol and saqib saleem role can be interchanged . I mean Bobby deol as anil Kapoor's son . I mean who wanna see this . And he doesn't look like his son . Overall acting are good of all actors .salman Khan did justice to the role.Jacqueline Fernandez also did justice to the role and people who say she can't act should see this movie .3 songs are good Heeriye,Allah duhai hai,I found love. background score was amazing loved it .direction was also good . Overall it's a 1 time watch movie .and you can watch this movie on lazy Sunday or when your getting bored ."

Cringy direction by remo d souza puthetic sequal. Salman khan made this movie to give work to unemployed people of industry. In short the movie is full of bad plot teist that will squize ur mind and this movie will make u realize why u invested ur time and money in this pogo cartoon or simply movie with also bad vfx."

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all for all those referring to Salman as being a wrong choice for this film need to remember what a big disappointment Race 2 was taking into consideration its predecessor Race both which had Saif Ali Khan. This movie was particularly anticipated and did not meet the expectations of the audience at all. Like every film this one had its flaws as well but what truly degraded the movie and its presentation as a whole was it's direction in my opinion. Remo D Souza who had previously directed the ABCD franchise was not a good option for this action thriller. Had it been Abbas Mustan it would've been a much engaging and crisp film with the same script and screenplay. 2 songs Heeriye and the Allah duhai hai revamped version were excellent rest was total crap and could have been edited out. Party chale on was good though. Acting was bizarre and out of place by everyone besides Salman, Anil and Jacqueline. Salman and Anil kapoor carried the film throughout on their shoulders. Costumes and locations were exquisite. Some dialogues and direction again was extremely poor. This film had potential but the repulsive execution is its weakness. Action was new, stylish and extremely watchable. Opportunity gone wasted. My rating is based on the fact if you just take this as a standalone film and not part of the race franchise. Race 3 while being a big miss, earned est 303 Cr at the box office which is just a reinforcement of the fact that Salman Khan is the Biggest Megastar Of India in this decade. Lets see how far he goes."

Anil Kapoor is the ultra stud who has done it with his bhabhi which is a dream for many middle class bois . Daisy Shah had no business in the movie. Jacqueline is so seductive that bhoi even took her to her farmhouse. Lord Bobby DJ is the master mind, he is the real son of Shamsher singh (sorry for spoilers). So overall it was a great suspense movie but wanted to see selmon bhois Driver's entry. Jis race se mujhe nikalne ki baat kar rahe ye bewakoof nahi jaante ki me us race ka sikandar hoon. SELMON we LoVEeeeee U <3."
