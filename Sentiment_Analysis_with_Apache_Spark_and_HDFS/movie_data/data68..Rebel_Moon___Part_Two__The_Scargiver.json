Even the most emotional scenes are laughable\n\nIt is just like an old western where a group of people band together to fight a common enemy except this movie tales place in space. The movie added nothing new just copy pasted the stale idea. I am not sure why Zack was so excited for this movie. The first part was watchable (it sucked) but the 2nd part made no sense.\n\nWatch it only if you have time and brain cells to kill."

The only reason I am giving this a 4 is for some of the special effects and action scenes- the acting is so wooden especially when they tell each other about their pasts. Part 1 is superior but I would stil only give it 5 as it at least attempts a Magnificent 7 in space type film. This was just a waste of space."

I don't know how this managed to be even more dull and boring than that one.\n\nThe script is so bad, the small amount of dialogue it has is insufferable, the pacing is so bad, it makes an already boring movie even worse. There's a part of the movie that is, montage, small bit of normal scene, more montage, another small bit of normal scene. It's hard to get through.\n\nThe relationship between the main team is almost nonexistent. You made a whole movie about them meeting, and in the second movie, they still barely talk with each other. In the final battle one of them tells another, \"If I must die\" and the other says \"together\" and it's genuinely the first time they spoke with each other.\n\nThe exposition is done so horribly. There's literally a scene where they go around a table and each of them does a summary of their origin story, as it's shown in flashbacks. And when most of them are done, one of them actually says \"What about you? You haven't told your story\".\n\nFinal battle has some nice sequences, but it's filled with just overdramatised moments of sacrifice and death, because these characters are basically cardboard.\n\nThere are some cool shots, some with the robot Jimmy, but that's all they are, shots that look cool. 0 significance, because we barely see him in the damn movie. And to finish the fight comes that Rebellion that was shown for like 5 minutes in the first movie? Yeah, the guy with the face paint. They just appear. No idea who called them, idk how they knew there was a fight, they just show up. Idk if I missed the part where they were called, because by then I was half asleep.\n\nThen obviously there's set up for the third movie. Yeah, I was committed to the 2 parts, I don't have another one of these in me."

Soldiers that cannot hit a target in a 1 by 2m passage, high tech ships that smoke like they are diesel powered, soldiers that behave like they were hired as extras on a F-grade scifi film (oh wait that's true) Fight scenes with energy weapons so close quarters that the fighters would rather hit their enemies with their rifle than shoot them. It's so insanely ridiculous I nearly chewed through my own foot out of frustration.\n\nThen the monologues. Lectures by warriors given to villagers they just met, minutes before. More lectures and 20 second \"tragic\" back stories that will make you wish the \"warriors\" telling them were rather killed on the spot by the evil empire, who apparently kill just for sport, and have no real motivation.\n\nActing so wooden and hollow, you'll feel like you're watching a play about hearding sheep, performed by the society of grave diggers, at your local town bowling alley on a Wednesday night during happy hour.\n\nIf you like this film, please, please, for the love of humanity, do not procreate."

The earlier versions of the show were disjointed with an ending that left me dissatisfied feeling as though I had just watched a half assed attempt to remake Star Wars, in fact it was so bad I actually fell asleep on the show. Snyder's personal kept me involved throughout the almost 6 hours of the 2 parter. If you watched this before I strongly suggest you give the new and improved versions a try."

These are not meant to be Academy Award nominated dialogues or scripts. They are meant to entertain you and I can't see how a sci-fi fan wouldn't find them fun.\n\nAs for the plot being just every big sci-fi blockbusters blended together, all I have to say is... if we can accept Avatar being \"Pocahontas in Space\" then we shouldn't have any problem accepting this as \"Magnificent Seven in Space\" or \"Seven Samurai in space\".\n\nI do believe that over time these will have a cult following and if people could just let themselves enjoy something fun maybe we could have a new cool cinematic universe here but with the reception they're getting it's doubtful."

        "review_detailed_main": "Alright, so I finally got around to watching Rebel Moon Part 2: The Scargiver, and let me tell you, it's a bit of a rollercoaster ride. On one hand, there's definitely been some improvement since the first film, particularly when it comes to the jaw-dropping action sequences. Seriously, they were inventive, eye-catching, and had me glued to the screen throughout.\n\nBut here's where things get a little complicated. While the action scenes were a major highlight, it felt like the filmmakers were more focused on laying the groundwork for a potential franchise rather than delivering a standalone, gripping story. This weakened the immediate stakes of the plot, leaving me feeling somewhat disconnected from the characters and their struggles.\n\nNow, let's talk about Zack Snyder. The guy's no stranger to controversy, and while I think he gets more flak than he deserves, I can't deny that there were some pacing issues in this film. Plus, some of the characters felt underdeveloped, which was a real missed opportunity considering the potential they had.\n\nOn the positive side, the visual spectacle of Rebel Moon Part 2 is undeniable. Snyder's signature style shines through, and there are moments of pure cinematic magic that left me in awe. But it's clear that the focus on franchise-building came at the expense of fully fleshing out the story and its characters.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Well, if you were a fan of the first Rebel Moon, you'll probably find Part 2 to be a more polished experience. The action is top-notch, and there's definitely a sense of progression in terms of the overall feel of the film. However, if you're looking for a completely satisfying conclusion with high stakes and deep character development, you might be left wanting more.\n\nIn the end, Rebel Moon Part 2: The Scargiver is a solid improvement over its predecessor, but there's still plenty of room for growth. Here's hoping that any future installments can strike a better balance between franchise-building and delivering a compelling, standalone story.\n\nThe hate for this film is not justified at all.\n\nPeople are treating zack Snyder like he killed a puppy."

It has become increasingly clear that his films, consistently lack meaningful plot progression and substantial character arcs.\n\nThe repetitive film sequences and copy and pasting, for me have become boring to watch. It sucks to watch his body of work, which fails to bring anything new to the table.\n\nThe persistent use of slow-motion effects seems more a stylistic crutch than a narrative necessity. The excessive reliance on CGI and these slow-motion scenes, which add nothing of value, is confusing.\n\nAdditionally, particularly the editing, was underwhelming. Glaring continuity errors in the scenes. I even saw the dull end of an axe slice a throat. These are not minor oversights; they significantly detract from the film's credibility.\n\nI had high hopes that 'Part Two' might redeem the cinematic tragedy of part one, but instead, it confirmed my reservations. This film feels more like a visual spectacle devoid of soul than a coherent narrative. Why make a story in 2 parts, 2 hours a piece, and prioritize flashy visuals over compelling storytelling?"

        "review_title": "Director's Cut Review Only",
        "review_detailed_main": "First, to be clear, I never watched the original releases. I read at the time Part 1 was released that there would be director's cuts of both parts, so I decided to wait til now. I have watched both parts of the director's cuts and submitting one review here for both. Both parts are essentially one long contiguous movie. My actually rating would be a 6.5 rounded down here for 6 stars. Also, I don't classify myself as a Snyder fan per se. His DC stuff was mediocre mostly though entertaining. I did like 300 and Watchmen a lot.\n\nRM is basically a hodge podge of ideas and concepts from past movies. Star Wars is obvious and mentioned as Snyder's inspiration. Other movies like Seven Samurai and even Chronicles of Riddick come to mind as well. To be clear though, that is not something that bothers me - I'm not mentioning it to be negative. Most movies are derivative these days. It's not a problem when it is done right and some originality is mixed in.\n\nThe effort of RM is admirable. However, IMO, what brings it down mostly is a weakish story and the connections between the characters. It is overstuffed and lacks cohesiveness. That is important stuff to any action scifi movie. Yet, on a positive note, the movie mostly looks good. Heavy CGI but good CGI. One thing of note though that I've noticed in other Snyder movies is a lot of unfocused views which are sometimes hard on the eyes. Still, the overall aesthetic is interesting and original. Lastly, at a high level, the movie is mostly entertaining with some good action. The director's cut is very graphically violent although the blood effects have a CGI quality to them. Some nudity/sex - mainly Sofia - which was fine.\n\nThe one point I'd really like to expand on is the connection between the characters. I felt this along with the mainline story let the movie down. A great example is the the opening act. A character survives through this nightmarish ordeal. He finds his way to our storied Moon, but while he is given a decent storyline it is mostly in the background. He barely interacts at all with the central character(s), and if I'm not mistaken, has a connection to the rebel leader.\n\nAnother example is Jimmy the Robot, played by Sir Hopkins. He also finds his way to the Moon, but spends much of the two movies waxing poetic about things we don't really know much about. He does perform one interesting act early in Part One, and then disappears for very long stretches before having quick scenes staring at stuff. He spends much of the movie hiding from the villagers as, I guess, he tries to \"find himself\". I felt Jimmy would have added a lot to this movie if his character was more central. IMO that was a big failure.\n\nNext you have Noble (Skrein) and Kora/Athe. Noble is clearly the baddie Vader type in this movie, which you know from the opening minutes. Kora and Noble have a enmity toward each other that is not really based on anything other than the current situation. Other characters would have much better reasons here. Noble needed a backstory. When you do get the backstories like Kora's there is no Noble in there. This would have added more depth to everything and satisfaction in the later stages.\n\nLastly, we are fed bits and pieces of backstory from Kora. I realize that this was fed to us slowly likely to build some mystery, even into Part II. I felt we needed more of this story early on to provide more context so that we could connect to the characters and events now. IMO a better prologue would have done wonders here.\n\nIn conclusion, RM DCs are very watchable movies but fall short of being truly good. But there is definitely something missing here. It could have been so much better. I do think RM would have worked better as a like an eight part first season."

I'm guessing the same will happen to this due to the dark tone of it) Then release the Snyder Cut, which is not only longer, but darker, more violent, with profanity and sexual scenes that wouldn't pass at PG-13. These cuts end up being the definitive versions of the film, and vastly superior to the one the studio put out initially.\n\nI don't know why the studios don't trust in Zack Snyder's original vision, as he's proved time and time again that his vision is the better movie.\n\nJustice League was infinitely better than the Joss Whedon debacle that was initially released, as it restored whole deleted sub-plots. Got rid of the cheesy(and sometimes sleazy) humour, and introduced a whole new big bad, which due to the poor reception of the studio butchered cinema release, has just been left hanging.\n\nBatman Vs Superman explored more of the story as a whole, went deeper into each characters psyche, and introduced more story threads that would be picked up in Zack Snyder's Justice League.\n\nWatchmen, the directors cut actually gave justice to it's original inspiration. The seminal comic book Watchmen. It was long thought to be unfilmable, but Zack Snyder pulled it off, and apart from one very uncomfortable sex scene, should be up thee with the best comic book adaptations ever made.\n\nI'm guessing you've got my point by now, and I know this time it was a marketing ploy by Netflix to have the two different version. One that's more family friendly and one that's a Hard R rated, adults only version. But please reserve judgement on this duology of movies until you've seen what is Zack Snyder's original vision. The man is a masterful filmmaker when he's let off a leash and encouraged to do what he wants to do. I for one can't wait to see a bloody, violent, sweary, and jet black version of both of these films, and they deserve to be seen before any judgement is passed on them."

Now the villagers have mere 5 days to prove their worth to fight while the warriors train them.

The flashback bit falls flat and a village full of farmers with handful of warriors to train them, fighting back not just a small army, needed a far more convincing narrative than just slow motion action set pieces. The predictable writing continues to pull down this film and it has the same issues as the first film. The action is shifted to Veldt only but even that proves to be not enough to salvage the mess."

There are a lot of references to Snyder's previous works, from 300 to Superman. Overall, it's all the Snyder we love. It's exactly the same level as his Justice League.\n\nBut Snyder really should have made a series, not a two-part film. Or an anime. Rebel Moon as an anime would have become a cult classic.

This sequel to \"Rebel Moon Part One: A Child of Fire\" is a bold and ambitious effort by Zack Snyder, which continues the epic space saga. While the first installment was met with mixed reviews, the sequel has managed to carve its niche by focusing on action, visual spectacle, and a streamlined narrative.\n\nTo fully appreciate \"Rebel Moon Part Two: The Scargiver,\" it is essential to view it in the context of its predecessor. The narrative in Part One lays a solid foundation for the characters and the world-building. However, the sequel significantly benefits from this groundwork, providing a more cohesive and engaging story. The first part's slower pace and character development lay the groundwork for the action-packed, thrilling ride that Part Two offers. The combination of both parts creates a more complete and satisfying experience, allowing the audience to connect deeper with the characters and their journey.\n\nOne of the most significant improvements in Part Two is the increased focus on action and visual spectacle. While Part One was criticized for its short fight scenes, Part Two delivers a more satisfying experience with its extensive, well-choreographed action sequences. The film's final act is a visual feast, featuring a spectacular battle sequence that showcases Zack Snyder's directorial prowess. The combination of stunning visuals, intense action, and a powerful score creates an immersive cinematic experience that is hard to forget.\n\nThere's rumors of a \"Director's Cut\" edition with more than four hours of the entire \"Rebel Moon\", I think this extended version is expected to offer a more comprehensive and detailed look at the story, characters, and world-building. With Snyder's reputation for delivering epic, visually stunning films, a \"Director's Cut\" could potentially receive a more positive reception. The additional runtime would allow for more in-depth exploration of the characters' motivations, relationships, and the overall narrative, which could address some of the criticisms leveled at the first two parts.\n\nI think \"Rebel Moon Part Two: The Scargiver\" is a significant improvement over its predecessor, offering a more engaging and action-packed experience. The combination of both parts creates a more cohesive and satisfying narrative, while the focus on action and visual spectacle in Part Two makes for a thrilling cinematic experience. The potential of a \"Director's Cut\" edition could further enhance the film, providing a more comprehensive and detailed look at the story, characters, and world-building.\n\nWhile the \"Rebel Moon\" saga may not be perfect, it is undoubtedly an ambitious and visually stunning effort that deserves recognition for its unique blend of action, adventure, and science fiction."

If people don't want him to keep producing things, best thing they can do is stop watching his material. I'm sure Netflix will get plenty of viewers of both installments of this flick. Will the ratings against the installments be enough for Netflix not to renew?\n\nGuess time will tell.\n\nI enjoyed both of these and would rate either better than Dune: Part One. Dune: Part Two might be slightly better, even though they veered from the book and I didn't really like the direction they took with Chani(also they left out a hell of a lot of background information, but was at least coherent this time).\n\nAnyway, this isn't a review about Dune. This segment of Rebel Moon was more fleshed out than the first. Also, while there was still slo-mo in the film, it wasn't as dominant as the first one. There was nothing groundbreaking in this film. It was just a good, action-packed Sci-fi. Most of the movie was action. You get more details about characters and what drives their anger/hatred.\n\nIf you are wanting a thinking mans Sci-fi or mystery or thriller, then this might not be for you. In general I prefer that genre of Sci-fi over this type. It was still fairly enjoyable and I hope they do continue to flesh out the story with continued development of the franchise."

Reports that should send shivers down the spine of anyone that appreciates feature films of quality if they have any validity.\n\nThe unwanted follow-on from last December's non-event that ended up being the much hyped and big budgeted Netflix original Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire, The Scargiver somehow manages to be much worse than its terrible forefather making one truly question if Snyder will ever be able to get back to the quality of films he use to deliver with the likes of Dawn of the Dead, Watchmen and 300.\n\nProclaimed to be Netflix's answer to the Star Wars cinematic universe, Rebel Moon has the bones of what might be an interesting and entertaining feature film world but as was the case with Part One, Scargiver is devoid of any spark or imagination to make it worth your time with one even beginning to wonder whether or not Snyder just wanted to showcase the joys of harvesting with most of Scargiver's first 30 - 40 minutes mostly made up of slow-motion crop work, making one beg for the end of the slow torture that if removed would have made this two hour \"event\" more like a 30 minute addition to the first outing.\n\nDoing very little that justifies the decision to cut the two Rebel Moon films into separate parts, Scargiver repeats all the same mistakes as Snyder's first offering as we once more follow Sofia Boutella's Kora and her merry band of freedom fighters protecting some grain from Ed Skrein's seemingly inept Atticus Noble, promising an epic Lord of the Rings like siege battle that instead becomes merely a procession of loud noises and pedestrian fight segments that are welcomed in by one of the years most cringe-worthy scenes that acts like an amateur hour Dungeons and Dragons night where Kora and her comrades tell each other their backstories.\n\nThere's not a single character here we can really get behind, perhaps other than Anthony Hopkins woods loving robot Jimmy, there's no performance that appears to be having any fun in the whole po-faced event and the action space that Synder once owned early in his career has here become a sad self-parody of his best works that would be at home in the bargain basement bin offerings of long gone Blockbuster Video stores.\n\nIn many ways The Scargiver is both the worst example of Netflix's big-budget failures and original IP's that every now and then strike gold but for the most part flop like this and also the sad state of Snyder's current career that looks like its destined to be stuck in the doldrums for the long-haul from here on out.\n\nWhile there's no doubt the Rebel Moon films were not supposed to re-write the rulebook and were designed with entertainment in mind, there's zero excuse for a film to be as bland and painful to endure as The Scargiver is making it an undeniable disaster and a new career low for a filmmaker who once promised to be one of the most enjoyable blockbuster voices in Hollywood.\n\nFinal Say -\n\nIf you thought Rebel Moon: Part One was bad you haven't seen anything yet! A slow-motion filled train wreck whose flying wheat is as interesting as its one-dimensional characters and yawn-inducing action scenes, Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver gives us very little to enjoyable no matter where you look.\n\n1/2 a backstory powwow out of 5.\n\nJordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"

I personally like the Warhammer esgue 40k scenes of the empire, there is a cute element of 7 samurai that's timeless and I loved the cheese of the A Team as a kid, and this feels very similar. Certainly not great, but not awful."

Yes it ripped off most other sci fi films, no there wasn't anything original about it and yes there was a bit too much slow mo but if you took it for a piece of entertainment and not much more then it was watchable and enjoyable from a certain perspective. Part two on the other hand... Holy crap.\n\nIt's like Zack Snyder just picked scenes and concepts that he liked from other films and threw them together with no regard as to how to make them flow. The \"character development\" is lazy and laughable to the extent that I've watched over 4 hours of these two films and I can remember the name of just one character. The amount of slow motion used is ludicrous, the premise of the situation (a village supplying an amount of grain so small that it wouldn't feed the crew collecting it for more than 3 days) is a joke and there are so many other irritatingly stupid and questionable details to annoy you that you'll be glad when it's over. Will the now obligatory Snyder cuts be better? Let's hope so."

It's nice to see a passion project in this genre in this day and age. Zack Snyder clearly cares about this subject matter. This isn't the first time he's compromised with a studio on a final product (I can see why Netflix would want to air the PG-13 version first; rake in the views before you give people what was originally advertised as an R-rated film on their second viewing if they feel like tuning back in several months of subscription fees later), to the point where it's not so much compromise as methodology. Few filmmakers would go through the effort to make something so personal only to say \"Yeah, go ahead, piss all over my movie, take final cut, I'll release my version later when everyone's already decided that yours sucks.\" Snyder is a fascinating visionary, a painter who likes to watch muscle-bound hulks punch robots in the face and spend 20 minutes on a harvest montage. What's really missing is the emotional punch that causes the audience to care about what happens on the screen; hopefully the R-rated cut will pack that punch. This is a failure with potential."

The action is definitely the highlight of the movie, but there are also standout performances to be noticed with some great work in front of the camera by the likes of Doona Bae and Djimon Hounsou. Boasting an adrenaline-fueled 3rd act and stakes that make your palms sweat, Rebel Moon Part Two: The Scargiver delivers much more than what part one had to offer, whilst managing to serve times of levity when needed and cheer-worthy moments pioneered by Sofia Boutella's convincing performance."

Then the huge orange-y cheap looking \"REBEL MOON\" titling appeared - and that unfortunately well-characterise the next two hours.\n\nIf Snyder was trying hard for \"style-over-substance\" - there was neither.\n\n'Dramatic' scenes ruined by bad plotting, tacky characterization, way over-bloated music and music-video-type scene setting.\n\nEg - the 'heroine' talking bout having murdered a child while naked in bed and then kiss kiss after? Really? Would be okay if it was a vile villain recalling it, but the heroine of your entire movie - just NO. And yes, throw in bad dialogue per the norm here to bring it down further.\n\nActing is uneven throughout - some actors were okay others were just not up to it, and throwing them in the same scenes just jars badly.\n\nThe plot if streamlined and skilfully trimmed could have worked fine, but not in its current frizz and hazy dazzle everywhere.\n\nAnd cut out rubbishy things like 'grains' being the prize to fight over - beings with technology to build giant spacecrafts can easily have means to produce 'grains' without having to steal it from 'farmers'. And why even 'grains'? Huh?\n\nDialogue is so so alarmingly amateurish - given that this project would have the budget to hire at least average writers, it's perplexing. Perhaps Snyder did the dreadful deed himself - if so, DON'T ever again!!\n\nA must watch for those interested in \"What an Expensive Bad Space Opera Looks and Sounds Like\"."

The utter stupidity of this idea is matched by dialogue that normally comes from the mouths of poorly drawn animation of the 1970s. This is not the worst film ever made because it doesn't deserve the name of \"a film.\" I beg you, if you cherish life, waste it not and do something, anything else than watch this garbage."

It is better, although it still has its problems.\n\nThe last half of the film is a spectacular battle, which certainly helps. Zack Snyder delivers destruction and pyrotechnics on an immense scale and we all know that he can manage stylish action with aplomb. So much so that you forgive the film for lapses in common sense and coherency.\n\nUnfortunately the first half of the film is less assured. An attempt is made to make us care for the village community our heroes are striving to protect. The most obvious example is an extended community harvest scene on which much care has been lavished, but it just doesn't work, perhaps because it does not \"fit\" within the overall narrative and so feels like it's forced in to the story.\n\nAlso, an effort is made to round out the characters of the band of heroes, but with a similar lack of success. Nevertheless Sofia Boutella, Djimon Housou and Bae Doona manage to bring their characters to some sort of life, without much help from the script or the director. The other heroes could almost disappear from the screen.\n\nSo the final battle is the key. Enjoy that and you forgive so much else. I did anyway."

There is nothing dramatic, nothing too fast, nothing that will actually require slow motion. Just a gimmick to double the time wasted on a scene.\n\nQuite a lot of flashbacks, presenting the history of the heroes. Of course, the flashbacks are full of slow motion.\n\nThen, the whole ideea, which is a continuation of Part One, nothing new, nothing interesting: one small village (+ 5-6 heroes) are up against a huge space ship, a Dreadnought, a warship.\n\nAnd the argument of the entire conflict?! Some bags of grain and one single enemy.\n\nBlast the entire village from orbit, plus 1000 square kilometers around it, call it a day."

The shots here is the best thing of the movie, it speak good visual storytelling and I feel that dramatic tense throughout the movie. My favorite is Jimmy's scene, the visual is just epic. The CGI is very cool too, salute to the team.\n\nThe choreography, sometimes I think they're cool, sometimes I feel like they're dumb.\n\nZack Snyder being Zack Snyder as usual, the slow motion effect is presence and I think this time is kind of satisfying. I even enjoyed the harvesting scene that many people complained, I see it like the character bonding to the everyday activity of the villagers.\n\nWhat I disappointed on this movie is the whole story, theme, and character's motives is not justified for the big fight and low reward. It's making the same mistake as the first part.\n\nThe main characters on the group still feels like a stranger meddling with someone else's business, even with all talk about their sad past. Talk big and all muscle and violence.\n\nFeel's like it's lazy writing, because they dump the exposition again and again. It makes me feel like I didn't care anymore about it.\n\nIt's either a bad writing and focusing on cool content or it's just a bad editing because I suspect there are many things that are edited out of the movie because it is left many things feel like rushed.\n\nWe know there going to be a continuation, maybe they prepared the unsaid story for the next movie. If it is, I think it's a bad decision. They introduced so many things at once and it's risking the movie to fail.\n\nI hope for the next movie, they going to give us a better story. I just take it the two first movie is for introduction and we get the main course in the next. I will wait for it."

Takes the brilliant concept of Spaceballs: The Breakfast Cereal and runs with it. The best film of its kind since the sci-fi yeast farming saga Gentlemen Broncos. Probably the best wheat-farming cinematography ever put to screen. The endless shots of scythes slashing through the air in slow motion evoke the mortality of man and the great circle of wheaty life. And they make a man hunger for a good hearty breakfast. Beautiful stalks of golden deliciousness swaying in the space-winds and lens flares. And the shots of the grains gracefully flying through the air are a breakfast cereal lover's dream come true. Casting Wil Wheaton (and cameos from the band Wheatus) as the wheat was a stroke of genius, and he should definitely be considered for the academy award. Truly life-changing and tasty. During this film I drank 8 tall cans of German Weissbeer in celebration of its wheaty glory. My only question is, how do the bad guys know what tasty wheat tastes like? Maybe what they think tasty wheat tastes like actually tastes like oatmeal or tuna fish? Either way we all need more whole grains in our diets, and this film advertises this health benefit to great effect. I've since bought 10 bulk cases of Shredded Wheat and now it and wheat beer is all I consume."

Your only problem is that it happens too quickly.

I think the real tragedy of them is that there might have been something better, or at least more interesting, lurking deep inside the production process. The way that the spaceships emerge from giant hyperspace vaginas, or that the dreadnaught is inexplicably powered by a gigantic head apparently fellating a bed of coal -- and heck, the fact that the dreadnaughts are coal-powered, sweaty coal-shovelers and all -- suggests some absolutely bonkers, Zardoz-level conceptual weirdness at the heart of these films' conception. I really wish they'd leaned into that, rather than focusing on slow-mo tableaus of falling wheat and lens flares, and cringey monologues from paper-thin characters. I don't know if that would have ever made it _good_, but at least it could have been more interesting."

        "review_detailed_main": "DON'T watch this.. just watch Part one.\n\nTo be clear, Part One was NOT great by any means, but it was much, much, MUCH better than the second film.\n\nThis is a lesson in how to build an entire multi-million dollar film with no forethought and just because you had an idea for a cliffhanger at the end of the first film. This isn't a 4 hr story broken into two films... it's a mediocre story told twice, under the guise of being two parts. Part Two is quite literally nothing more than a different way to tell Part One. (A la ChatGPT's second generation for the same prompts - ya get the same thing, just slightly different)\n\nPart two serves no purpose. It just retells part one for the most part... mixing in FAR too much harvesting, grain production and literally retelling character backstories which were told in Part One. (WTF???).\n\nJust like part one.. this is a mix of 7 Samurai (aka Magnificent 7) and Star Wars.. but oddly the two worlds never actually intertwine. Space ships faster than the speed of light.. but still need a sickle and scythe to harvest??? A sentient robot, or a hologram communication device, but no simple machines to sort and store grain.. m'kay. Looooooong slow motion flashbacks to re-establish characters that were already established in part one.\n\nI quite honestly don't understand anyone that would read this script and think it's worth millions. But it could possibly be Snyder getting one over on Netflix.. Netflix pays to have it made, Snyder ultimately delivers trash (Like most of his films).\n\nThis is bad... on par with Sy-Fy/Aslym film writing. \"Rebelgeddon!\" .. \"Rebel Moonado!\" --- Nonsensical, full of plot holes and pointless, poorly acted, wan-a-be-dramatic character building regarding cardboard cutout characters you've seen in any one a thousand films over the past 40 years. But at least Asylum knows they are making \"schlock\". Snyder thinks he's making gold apparently..... but it's pyrite in reality, looks shiny, but is worthless.\n\nApparently grain/wheat only grows on ONE planet in the entire universe..... And this huge high-tech multi-planetary army can't figure out how to feed itself unless they conquer a bunch of farmers with shovels and rakes???\n\nSo much more, but I'm avoiding actual spoilers.\n\nVERY typical Snyder... pointless, nonsensical plot holes, and focusing on CGI far, far, FAR more than any story.\n\n---- PASS -------"

Unlike many sequels that introduce entirely new elements, this one maintains continuity with both the storyline and the cast.\n\nIn terms of action, it surpasses the first edition, delivering a relentless barrage of excitement. If you're seeking non-stop action, you'll find plenty of it here.\n\nThe story remains consistent, but it's essential to watch the first part before delving into this one. Without that context, the movie won't make much sense. Therefore, it's crucial to maintain the sequence.\n\nAdditionally, Sofia Boutella's portrayal is notably improved in the second edition, featuring enhanced action choreography.\n\nOverall, Netflix has done a commendable job with this presentation, earning a solid 6.5/10 from me."

Seriously though, I feel the point of slow mo is to emphasis a point, create an emotion... if you do them every freaking time My Synder they loose any meaning and are just annoying!\n\nThe good stuff. I like the world. The design is cool, if very video gamey (40k, Star Craft, Ridick, Halo you name it!) But it works. I love the premise, the mercenaries vs ridiculous odds never tires with me. I like some of the actors. The effects are decent enough.\n\nThe rest... the dialogue makes George Lucas look like Shakespeare! The 'acting' is poor as there is little to work with. The script is all over the place. The beauty of 7 Samurai and Magnificent 7 is that the characters did not need the whole backstop thing. James Colburn, he was the hardened merc, cold blooded and good with knives. You got that the scene you met him. DONE! Steve McQueen, quick, cool, ladies man kind off. Again, established in the first scene. 2 movies in and I barely see these guys as characters, just bland with back stories which do NOTHING! The action is all slowed down to mostly a bore. The story makes no sense (please tell me how a ship can survive in deep space for so long, but a 100 bags full of grain cannot under and circumstances be blown up?) I wanted this to be good, a fresh franchise which could enjoy. Even some dumb fun. This is not fun, and times where you think it might redeem itself, it throws it away again in the next scene. Give me Roger Corman's 'Battle Beyond the Stars' any day over this, it may be cheese-tastic crap, but it knows how to have some fun!"

A true wordsmith. Nonchalant smile and a self asserting nod to himself and his level of humble supremacy in the smarts department.\n\nDialog is vapid and cringe. Snyder thinks his writing rivals Shakespeare. It does not.\n\nIt rivals, barely, a five year old child that has a faintest understanding that written words exist. Email spam is better written than this.\n\nAction is empty, not interesting and without stakes, in short - boring. Music is hilariously serious and without merit.\n\nPlot is embarasingly stupid. Acting is either bad or .. well, worse. Characters are wasted, villain is the same dude as in the first movie, but somehow... less. Oh, lord, oh no. I'm having flashbacks to the endless slo-mo harvesting scene.\n\nAlso, she cuts her hair to look like in the olden days of her glory. Dude shaves, looks like a goober, promptly exits the \"franchise\".\n\nVisually unimpressive, yet expensive.\n\nI thought \"telling and not showing\" is bad, but somehow Zack Snyder managed to make \"show and tell and narate it at the same time\", and it's worse.\n\nOnly thing that can challenge this netflix trash is, well, a first Rebel Moon movie.\n\nZack Snyder is truly and most probably the worst overpaid director at this moment. Everybody says he should do photography in a movie, not direct or write. Man, I wouldn't give him my phone to take a picture of me on a vacation in front of a monument, let alone a movie.\n\nAgain, don't support this. Watch paint dry, stare into a blank wall, do nothing, sleep, sit on a cactus, but don't watch this."

I wish Snyder would stop compromising to keep people happy. Why Netflix would want to pay Zack that money to make the films he did, only to make him cut and film different versions, for the worst, as there obviously were. To anyone not seen any of the 4 films, skip the original cuts and go straight to the directors cuts. Or, if you like film, and you can see how his version of the Justice League turned out, watch the originals, then the directors cuts, and see what a bit of different material, different cutting, more time, gives you almost a different film experience all together."

You can tell it is not the movie Snider wants you to see, but still worth a watch. The characters need to be developed more, but i think this will be solved with the real Snider vision for this film when it is released. I bet the directors cut will be excellent! I have seen both movies a few times and am looking forward to seeing if this universe continues. I can see why disney said no to these films,they are much darker then starwars, but honestly, I really like it. Don't listen to the negative reviews, this is a solid scifi."

The answer to that hope was a hard no!\n\nThere were so many terrible elements to the movie it's hard to focus. As I was watching all I could think was, did AI generate this script? It was so painfully predictable and cliche. Like the Wish (or Temu?) version of Star Wars mixed with every other SciFi movie of the past 30 years. There's literally a death star explosion scene with a character saying \"you may fire at will\" just as the ship explodes! Like WTF?\n\nThe acting is atrocious as well. The pauses between lines gives the audience time to correctly guess what's coming next, the emotion is wildly superficial (line delivery is comically dull), and 90% of the characters just have blank stares most of the movie.\n\nSeriously, I could rip on this trash heap all day but I can summarize by simply saying, avoid this one. There isn't even campy charm to it, it's just a waste of time and of course they leave it open for a third movie, ugh. I apologize for any typos in this review, I promise I dedicated more time to writing this than the writers of this movie spent on the script."

The acting was one dimensional. Yes all hell has broken loose but a good lead would smile, laugh, reminsence, get angry from time to time and not just show just one emotion all the time.\n\nThe movie leaves alot of areas that could be explored in other media for sure.\n\nThe special and visual effects are absolutely world class. Some of the scenes are true visual poetry or new renaissance.

        "review_detailed_main": "Oh boy.\n\nAfter part 1 I genuinely thought \"it can't be worse than this\". Well ladies and germs, it somehow got worse.\n\nI used to be a Snyder fan. I really enjoy 300 and Watchmen, and I think Man of Steel is a very underrated superhero movie. I even appreciate BvS in spite of its clear flaws, and I like The Snyder Cut well enough (though on a recent rewatch it didn't hold up as well as the first viewing). This, and part 1 before it, seriously make me question if I can get excited for a Snyder film again.\n\nSome positives to start with, there are some cool visuals (SOME, we'll come back to that), I like the design of the robot character and his entrance to the fight is pretty cool, and the space shots have a pretty sweet look to them. There are also a few cool fight moments scattered about amongst the chaos.\n\nNow, that aside, there really isn't much worth your time in this thing. To start with, and honestly kinda the most disappointing for a Snyder flick, I really don't care for the visuals. The CGI is fine, I wouldn't consider it glaringly bad really, but the film is unpleasant to look at most of the time. I respect using some old and dirty lenses, but Snyder's insistance on using them wide open the whole time (and in this case on a sensor way bigger than they were built for) just creates a muddy and mushy look with so much distortion. Beyond that the costumes and sets aren't terribly impressive either, they're perfectly fine, but not super impressive, and the bland color grade doesn't help either.\n\nThe action as well is pretty lackluster. Constant (like bordering on parody level) slow mo, and when it's not that it's just poorly choreographed and choppy. So many times that someone without a gun stands in front of multiple armed attackers and not a shot is fired at them.\n\nI won't talk much crap on the actors, cause they're doing their best with arguably the weakest aspect of the film, the script. The dialogue (little that there is) is bland at best, laughable at worst. About the time that the main characters all sat around a table giving their DnD character introductions for like 10 minutes straight I knew we were in for a world of hurt.\n\nI really could go on and on about all the nonsense (like this ship that can travel through portals being powered by coal in a Titanic like engine room), but really the simplest way I can describe this film is that it feels like a movie made by a 12 yr old boy who's trying to make it not feel like a movie made by a 12 yr old boy. It's 2 (or 4 as a whole) hours or Snyder trying so hard to be cool that it just ends up over the top and goofy as hell.\n\nMaybe the director's cuts will improve them, I don't really care and at this point I'm sick of him making us all watch marginally better director's cuts to make up for appalling theatrical (if this can be called that on a straight to streaming movie) releases."

This is shocking.\n\nEverything about this movie, and I mean everything, but especially the cast, was HORRIBLE. The lead actor, Sofia Boutella and villain, Ed Skrien was awful.

The heroes are heroes and the villains are villains, so don't expect any twists and turns. It's also a fairly boring story to be honest, and the harvest part seemed to drag on for far too long. That said, it's a decent action movie if there's nothing better to watch - 5/10 is a bit generous on my part but 4 would be too low.\n\nIn short, don't expect too much and you may find it to be an okay movie.\n\nEdit: I have now come to the conclusion that this movie is only a 5 and not a 6 as I wrote in my initial review."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver (2024)' is essentially that episode of 'Game Of Thrones (2011-2019)' season 8 where everyone sits around for an hour waiting for the Night King to arrive, followed by that episode where the Night King does arrive and there's that big battle at Winterfell, except none of the preamble is entertaining and the battle takes place in the day but is no more compelling just because we can actually see it. Following a brief recap by Jimmy the robot, the film picks up with the surviving members of the ragtag rebel crewn/ croon (see what I'm trying to do here?) arriving back on Veldt thinking they aren't in a sequel and won't have to defend the village that hired them after all. However, it soon becomes apparent that they are in a sequel and that the baddies are coming not only to take the grain they were promised but also to capture some high-value targets and likely kill everyone in the community as well. The team must prepare the farmers for the upcoming battle; the supposed 'training' mostly consists of slow-motion farming montages and one or two brief scenes that establish the farmers are somehow completely competent in the art of war despite the fact that most of them have never even held a gun (seriously, these sequences don't show anyone failing at any time, instead portraying them all as just instantly as gun-savvy as John Wick). The movie's first half culminates in a laborious scene in which the main warriors sit around a table and take turns trauma dumping their dreadfully generic backstories that are all essentially the same as each other. I don't think it's a spoiler to say that the film's second half is where its big battle finally kicks off (that's what one-and-a-half film's worth of buildup has been about, after all), and - to be fair - the skirmish itself is fairly entertaining in its own generally subpar way. That sounds like I'm hesitant to admit that it's good, but I just want to make sure I'm not making it sound better than it is. In a more competent film, it wouldn't be up to par; here, it's more enjoyable than you'd expect. Still, it struggles to balance its various elements and plays out like a string of loosely connected vignettes rather than a cohesive sequence. The characters feel like they freeze whenever they aren't on screen and there's no sense of stakes because the movie has never really done any character work (even when it thinks it's doing character work). We just don't know any of these people and the spectacle isn't spectacular enough to truly hold your attention based solely on its aesthetics alone. Like the first film, the experience is entirely inconsequential. It's empty fluff that somehow cost millions of dollars. Its incredibly limp and bizarrely vague sequel-tease ending (which, by the way, does the opposite of get you excited for a potential follow-up) feels entirely contractual and devoid of any real energy on the part of anyone involved. It's emblematic of the odd oxymoron at the feature's core: it's a passion project that seems to lack any real passion. Zack Snyder has butchered his own work here, and it's hard to see how his long-promised \"director's cut\" (which makes no sense considering he seems to have had full creative control from the moment Netflix got involved with him) will make any of this any better. The problems run too deep for that. This may be better than its predecessor, but it's still not good enough."

I guess there are some wide CGI shots that look passable even for a Netflix release. But even after a while, the action scenes get boring fast. Thank god this was only a two hour movie.\n\nThe dialogue is trying so hard to be serious and meaningful that it comes across as shallow and pretentious. Almost every line is some epic speech or flowery claptrap that wants to be cool or memorable that it just goes in one ear and out the other.\n\nThe robot (voiced by Anthony Hopkins) is the one likable character while the villain (a wildly over-the-top Ed Skrein) gives the most entertaining performance. Djimon Hounsou tries to add some resemblance of gravitas with his performance. But even he gets one-note after a while. This movie made Djimon Hounsou boring. Shame on Zack Snyder.\n\nSofia Boutella in supporting roles can be a captivating screen presence. But I'm afraid she is not yet leading lady material. Her romantic scenes with an embarrassed looking Michael Huisman are pretty dreadful. And even that turned out to be a waste of time.\n\nI don't fancy myself as someone that even dislikes Zack Snyder in general. I liked some of his work. I liked Dawn of the Dead, 300, and I actually really enjoyed Man of Steel.\n\nBut he needs to hire better writers and to stop taking himself so damn seriously. Just have some fun for once."

I was reluctant to watch the director's cut, but once you make the choice, you won't regret it. And yes, it is a Zack Snyder movie, and his cut is defintely more like him.\n\nThere are still a lot of questions that remain unanswered (the sisters that power the ships, the future of the kingdom and the robot to name a few, there are more), but that is either left open for your own imagination like a good sci fi should, or it leaves an opening for yet another sequel. Either way suits me just fine."

We already knew Zack would deliver in these areas. The protagonists story, that's is where Kora stands apart from her contemporaries.\n\nSnyder is doing stuff that no other director has the stones to do. Kora is the one.\n\nAs the battle wrapped up, I couldn't shake the feeling that this still feels incomplete.\n\nNot sure if it's a marketing trick or I if simply need more cowbell.\n\nIn summary, \"It gave what needed to be given\"\n\nThe next re-watch will be a 4 hour experience.\n\nBring on the Snydercut of these movies."

Unnecessary forced slow motion cuts. Dumbest script. Flat & long emotional scenes that nobody invest in. Cut & paste old action scenes with space weapons..low levels of creativity. Bad acting as the top icing. Literaly first hal of the movie was without any action, just main characters TALKING about how sad thier lives were and trying desperately to attache us to the characters but failing.\n\nI don't know maybe they made it so fast as a cash grab after the first one for NetFlix. What do I have to give to see another movie like 300???"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Rebel Moon\" is graphically impeccable, and the main antagonist is quite impressive, but that's where the positives end. The script is a disaster, feeling like it belongs in the era of \"Idiocracy\" with its complete lack of logic and incessant nonsense that seems to bother no one.\n\nFrom the get-go, with the lengthy scythe reaping of grain, I found myself wondering whether this was a film or an attempt to hypnotize the viewer. Worse still are the chaotic fight scenes where heroes waste ammunition shooting at each other from close range and missing, reminiscent of the worst clich\u00e9s from \"Star Wars\" - but without any charm. Really, continuously charging headlong into machine gun fire is true torture.\n\nAnother issue is the pacing of the narrative. \"Rebel Moon\" stubbornly turns every potentially exciting moment into a test of the viewer's patience. The action slows are so predictable and artificial that instead of building tension, they merely prompt yawns.\n\nIn summary, \"Rebel Moon\" could have been a cinematic hit if only someone had devoted more time to refining the script instead of allocating all resources to special effects. It's a production that, despite a dazzling facade, is internally empty and irritatingly absurd. For fans of special effects who can overlook the lack of any narrative coherence, it might be tolerable, but for the rest, it's nothing more than a frustrating waste of potential."

Credit where its due some of the scenes were cool looking but i was so uninterest I didn't really care.\n\nNo hate to the actors because they were all brilliant but the characters in this film were despicable. They were all diabolical. Literally all the development we get on the characters is a conversation where each character takes turns explaining their backstories. Can you get any lazier than that???? As a result whenever there was a character death I didn't really care because I'd literally no idea who the character was.\n\nOne of the worst 2 hours ever. The whole plot is an incoherent mess with stupid little cuts that don't make sense. NO ONE WANTS THE SNYDER CUT FOR REBEL MOON. As soon as the extended editions come out (if you're gonna release a film and be like it'll get good when the extended edition comes out ur either high or really stupid) I'm gonna trash them too. Literally the whole movie was preparation for a stupid battle scene. Might be the least progressive action movie to ever exist. 0.1/10."

It's a film of two halves as it spends the first half focusing on slow motion farming instead of character development which really hinders the stakes of the final battle. However, that second half is just an hour long battle so it's worth it overall.\n\nSofia Boutella is still able to give Kora a level of depth that exceeds what's on the page. Djimon Hounsou gets so much more to do and the added depth that he, Bae Doona and Staz Nair get is welcome even if it still isn't enough. Ed Skrein might be the best though with his thoroughly evil performance.\n\nZack Snyder's direction remains as visually stylish as ever. He's at his strongest in the second half when the focus is on making cool action scenes with his trademark slow motion but the use of that is really beginning to border on self parody. Flaws and all, it's still nice to see a Netflix blockbuster that feels like it was made by a human more than an algorithm.\n\nWhen it was first announced that both parts were made for around $160 million it sounded so impressive and it still is but this one being set almost exclusively on the one farm makes this universe feel real small. Tom Holkenborg's score has the required bombast and sincerity whilst coming dangerously close to copying his work on Batman V Superman."

Rebel Moon is better at star wars than Star Wars by every possible metric. This is just a fact. There's no grounds for debate, and it isn't close. Unhampered by a busted failure of a canon, space wizard incest shenanigans, manipulative muppetry, or trash hippie metaphysics, RM presents an extravagant and gloriously integrated audiovisual spectacle with delightful, delicate conceptual twists on genre conceits in abundance. The PG-13 version works well enough for what it is, but you're really gonna want to do yourself a favor here and pick up the clearly definitive and quite ultraviolent R-rated directors cut.\n\nWhile there may not be much left to say about tributary mode politics - which is what this is about, attempted Nazi gloss notwithstanding - what Rebel Moon does have to say it says directly, with sincerity, honesty, and conviction, it being a film that has somehow escaped the last half century of irony poisoning completely unscathed. And what, exactly, does it say?\n\nThat it is better to die on your feet than live on your knees. That freedom can only be realized together. That love and war aren't that far apart. That respecting your landbase and your fellow flora and fauna is cool and good actually. That small bands of militant guerillas can beat a high tech, high energy totalitarian empire - and even perhaps that they are the one of the only things that ever could.\n\nRarely have I seen such a singular synthetic totality realized this absolutely. Snyder has performed an act of gargantuan cojones here, a kind of almost unspeakably obscene conceptual terrorism (but I'll speak it anyways): he has liberated the concept of star wars from Star Wars without paying Lucas or Disney a dime.\n\nWhat a game. What a player.\n\nDear internet: your inability to appreciate this masterpiece is a you problem, a skill issue, and what this says about your maturity, values, intellect and character ain't great. You've been watching pablum for so long you've forgotten that a true film demands its own interpretive apparatus - and ya'll only have the one, don'cha?\n\nPathetic - but your failure to enjoy greatly enhances my enjoyment. It's a like 9.8 on its own merits, points knocked off for a dull and self-indulgent ending to pt. 2, but 11/10 for the scrub tears."

The story is better fleshed out than a fair amount of other sci-fi action flicks; the fight scenes are overall pretty good; the acting in the majority of the film was good; and the graphics quality is really strong. This movie got me emotionally invested in the story and the characters: I found myself rooting for the protagonists and some of the supporting characters, and hating the antagonists. If the movie elicits an emotional response in me, it's doing something right. This isn't gonna win any awards, but it's not nearly as bad as some reviews would lead you to believe.

If you're tired and feel like switching your brain off for a couple of hours, or if corny, ridiculous space operas are your guilty pleasure, you might enjoy this. I actually did :) Even though I don't think that's what the director thought he was creating.\n\nBut (speaking of the director) someone please tell Mr. Snyder to cut down on the slow motion scenes. I imagine he means them as deep or philosophical, but they just look so painfully pretentious."

It says something about a movie when already on 15th minute stops being watchable.. My honest opinion: The scene with the royal family assassination is a copy paste Ceasar movie scene, only very bad one, the 7 samurais in Star Wars movies, the read servants and Bene Gesserit Sisterhood cheap knockoff (Dune), the Vikings rip off in harvesting village- and somehow he managed to \"get inspired\" by the Witcher the origin story and Star Trek strange new worlds (there's probably much more but it was too painful to watch) There's this idea of The rebel moon being a new universe, but the reality is it is a very bad mashup of all old well known and respected universes (movies) Music is not corresponding, scenes are forced and very badly organised, dialogues seem written by kindergarten kids exercise, slow motion is exaggerated and unnecessary in 99%, the story is unrelatable and inconsistent (ST strange new worlds CAN have this jump from highly developed planet to one from Stone Age BECAUSE THEY ARE JUST DISCOVERING THEM, it doesn't work if they're the part of the same empire !) the acting is very sadly bad, surprisingly so for the quality actors. I still haven't finished the movie, cannot convince myself on torture. There are people dying from hunger and Netflix decided to spend millions on bad references to already existing good movies."

Additionally, the action sequences are thrilling, and the cinematography enhances the overall experience. The supporting cast also delivers solid performances, adding depth to the story.

The film's second half is an exhilarating rollercoaster ride of action, drama, and breathtaking special effects that make it a must-watch for fans of the genre.\n\nWhile the movie delivers an enthralling second act, the first hour might test the patience of some viewers, as it seems to drag on with a somewhat slow pace. However, once the story gains momentum, it becomes an unforgettable cinematic experience. The character development and world-building are commendable, but the initial sluggishness detracts from what could have been a consistently engaging narrative.\n\nNevertheless, Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver ultimately triumphs with its impressive visuals, compelling storyline, and thrilling action sequences. It's a worthy addition to the sci-fi genre, providing enough excitement and intrigue to satisfy even the most discerning fans."

Here's a Clue: He and Shymalan should never be allowed money ever again to make a movie. A galactic empire needs to loot a planet of grain? Really? That's right from the Seven Samurai where the bad guys are coming for the harvest. I can understand this in medieval Japan, but a GALACTIC EMPIRE? The dialogue in this mess is beyond corny. Beyond bad. Beyond beyond. Snyder doesn't have an original idea. I don't know how much Netflix sank into this trash, but this must be where their decision to move away from big budget came from. This is just a laughably bad movie. It almost makes Sucker Punch - I still want my money back for this - look good."

Instead of two separate films, Zack should have made a 3+ hours-long movie.\n\nDespite the predictable story, it still manages to captivate me. The characters' backstories are well-developed, giving them a strong motivation to fight for Veldt. However, the robot \"James\" lacks any meaningful arc explaining his peculiar attire. Nonetheless, his presence as a spectator over the village reminded me of Ephialtes from 300 and as a superhero during the battle.\n\nZack's slow-motion effects may be slightly overused and the cinematography is decent in comparison to his other works.\n\nIn my opinion, if Lucasfilm had allowed Zack to make these films under the Star Wars franchise, they would have been better spin-offs. There would have been no need to waste time creating worlds and cultures for this story to be made as films.\n\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it without hesitation. I'm eagerly anticipating seeing it become a franchise.\n\nRatings for this movie seems unfair."

The entire village would have been obliterated due to the slowness of cutting crops and running very slowly. On top of that the amount of sun glares, light flares... everything is flaring and hazy. How can you have both of them at the same time? Either the entire universe is polluted and hazy but crispy enough to provide immense amount of glare/flares. It doesn't make sense. When Lora and the general was talking the sun didn't even match their conversation, horrible attention to detail. Useless scenes. Call it what is is... Copy seven samurai and add space and star wars.

Viscerally, that's enjoyable... there's plenty of lasers and explosions and guns and tanks to go around.\n\nThis second part is much more straightforward than the first. The first was bogged down by the worldbuilding Snyder had to do, or felt he had to do, to get the characters involved... and ultimately we didn't necessarily need ALL those characters. This second part is a little preamble to the big battle and then, yeah, big battle.\n\nSo... having watched all manner of sci-fi \"epics\" over time, this certainly is a Zack Snyder sci-fi \"epic.\" I can feel the effort that went into it. I can also see the parallels to Star Wars, because Snyder couldn't DO Star Wars. I'll dare say... this is better than some current Star Wars, like The Acolyte. I don't hate The Acolyte, but for anyone who wanted more \"cool factor\" in Star Wars... here you go. This has some cool factor. A very comic-booky, pulpy movie from the guy who does a lot of those fairly faithfully to what makes something comic-booky.\n\nTry not to overthink this one. It's just a slightly better Michael Bay film about space totalitarians being showed up by plucky rebel fighters."

If you enjoyed the world Snyder created in the prequel, you'll likely appreciate this sequel to be a worthy follow-up.

Sure, the costumes and spaceships look cool, but it's missing that emotional punch that makes you care about what's happening on screen. Dull, repetitive, generic, uneventful.

But once you accept that, it is fun to watch. Too much slow-mo for my taste, but it's Snyder. The style is coherent and well designed - I enjoyed the overall looks. The acting had huge variations. Some great moments, some really bad ones. I liked the interpretation of the 7 Samurai theme but the characters did not get the development they would have needed. And I definitely would have chosen a different character to die in battle. But overall my inner scifi-geek had a good time in front of the screen. Hence a 6/10 instead of a 4/10 (which would be my movie critic vote - but with that metric I would have had to vote the last two Star Wars movies 3/10)."

No. Will you get great action and stunning old-school visuals with tons of bullet time? Hell yes. Tons of it.\n\nThe plot is not the greatest, far from it. It's not Dune. It doesn't have well thought out lore as Lucasfilm's Star Wars. And to be honest, I find it kind of refreshing. A movie you won't remember for anything but amazing CGI and great fight scenes. I'm not expecting anything else from Zack's movies.\n\nPeople may compare it to Star Wars, and to be quite honest, I was much less insulted by Rebel Moon 1 and 2 than new trilogy under Disney's all-seeing eye.\n\nRM is its own thing. A great, ridiculously high budget B-tier thing. Its plot is cohesive so far (at least that little bit of plot that's hiding there), even though a little bit too easy to digest for my taste.\n\nIn my opinion (for which you can downvote me all the way down), Rebel Moon franchise is now amongst my top 10 action focused scifi franchises. Because I simply like what it is, and it doesn't give me any space to dislike it for what it isn't. That's how simple this movie is.\n\nIf I should compare it to something from real life scenario, Rebel Moon is like an A-class hooker. It's beautiful, it's not the smartest and you won't find there the meaning of life or your next wife. You visit it just for visually stunning fun that you might regret visiting 2 days after you're done with it. And I find it beautiful."

It was the same with Justice League. It just never feels natural. Something about the way they monologued their stories all at once was just weird. I know we're trying to quickly establish a reason to care about these people and their backgrounds but it just didn't work for me. It's not a bad popcorn flick and I would probably watch it again in the future but I'm Just not sold on his execution of action films anymore. It would take a lot for me to spend money at the theaters to see anything Zac Snyder puts out anymore."

Instead of \"epic\" he gave us an inflated, color by numbers, slow motion boring fest.\n\nStealing every idea from every sci-fi movie he could, including obviously The Matrix ideas and palette, the whole Star Wars universe, and The Magnificent Seven and A Bug' s Life, Snyder fired up his video editing suite, lowered brightness until nothing could be seen, added HDR, lens flares and color, and then thought he had made a great movie. Sadly, his kindergarten-grade storytelling abilities betray him everytime he tries to direct.\n\nHe could be an amazing videogame cutscene designer, or an interesting director of photography. But writing and directing? They are so above and beyond his capabiities it's not funny."

The villain is a force who shows he can square up when need be(given he's not to busy taking out his anger on his own people). The battle scene was awesome, next level awesome. If you like sci fi then I don't see the need to complain about that (extra long) scene. I'd watch the movie just to see the battle. Can't do a review without mentioning how great Hopkins is as the jimmy! Feel like that's just a given at this point in his career. Ending is sufficient, not necessarily a cliff hanger but definitely open ended.\n\nI'd recommend to anyone to give it a watch with an open mind! Hope we get a few more."

So, either CGI or story, but not both.\n\nAnd it became CGI, trying to compensate for the thin story, which it does pretty well.

Anyway, we're talking about two movies that are basically one movie that has been split into two movies.\n\nWar enters the city in Rebel Moon Part 2: The Scargiver\n\nSuch a choice to split the film into two parts is really a stupid decision, and Snyder has easily and in the best possible way hit his film, and this issue has been very conscious. But the movie could have put this extra time on other parts. For example, a large part of the first half was devoted to the wheat harvest and its importance was mentioned many times by the characters, but at the end of the movie we realized how unnecessary and unimportant this whole time is and Snyder really doesn't care a bit about his script and writing. In fact, instead of spending more than half of its time on boring and completely redundant scenes, the film could have focused more on the story and characters rather than being on the side of completely one-dimensional stories and characters."

The music with the lyrics, well... I kinda felt they were very very juvenile. I personally feel like Zack Snyder enlisted his children to write the lyrics.

While some of his works showcase impressive visuals, others fall flat due to repetitive elements and weak narratives. For instance, \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\" received criticism for its convoluted plot and lackluster character development. The film's action sequences, while visually striking, often lacked coherence in choreography, leading to disjointed fight scenes that failed to engage viewers effectively.\n\nAnother example from Snyder's repertoire is \"Sucker Punch,\" which suffered from a disjointed storyline and overreliance on stylized visuals at the expense of coherent storytelling. The film's attempts at blending fantasy elements with real-world drama resulted in a muddled narrative that left audiences perplexed rather than immersed.\n\nMoving beyond Snyder's films, there are numerous instances in the realm of Netflix originals where budget constraints have led to subpar productions. One such example is the series \"Iron Fist,\" which faced criticism for its lackluster fight choreography and uninspired cinematography. The show's action sequences often felt staged and lacked the dynamic energy expected from a martial arts-based storyline.\n\nAdditionally, Netflix's \"Death Note\" adaptation received backlash for its departure from the original source material, resulting in a weak storyline that failed to capture the essence of the beloved manga and anime series. The film's pacing issues and underdeveloped characters further contributed to its overall negative reception.\n\nIn terms of cinematography, Netflix's \"The Ridiculous 6\" is another example of a poorly executed production. The film's visual style and editing choices were often jarring, detracting from the viewing experience and highlighting the limitations of its budget.\n\nOverall, while Zack Snyder has delivered visually impressive moments in some of his works, the lack of cohesive storytelling and effective choreography has been a recurring issue. Similarly, budget constraints have led to shortcomings in various Netflix originals, highlighting the challenges faced in balancing visual spectacle with narrative depth and technical execution."

Like there's no difference between this series and the entire Riddick franchise aesthetically (except maybe for the amount of slow motion lol, and more modern CGI too), whereas Villeneuve's Dune creates its own style with some \"Lawrence of Arabia\" polishing. There is almost no stake at all, thanks to the plot armor that amplifies the fighting prowess of the good guys (even though most of them are not built for that) while at the same time, dumbs down the supposedly well trained bad guys (tch, classic).

Its basically a terrible film on every conceivable level.\n\nThere is a scene mid way through where all the main heroes relay their individual back stories, and they sit around in a convenient semi circle, 2 of them placed awkwardly on 3 sides of a rectangular table, presumably to make it easy to film them together. Thats the level of film-making on offer here im afraid. I would say this is not worth 2 hours of anyones time to be perfectly honest. 1/10."

And I do, which I can also say the same about Part Two.\n\nIt's a direct continuation of Part One, picking up from where it ended. As a standalone film of course it won't make anyone go \"wow I just watched a really decently fun movie\". It's pretty much all action because that's what A Child of Fire led to. Hard to squeeze in some nice scenery shots on a battlefield, that's why it is lacking those compared to the prequel, understandably.\n\nAnother thing this lacks are further exploration of the Rebel Moon world and characters development. I thought we'd get those in sequel if not in the first part. Because of it the movie feels blank. A no-brainer, just science fiction fighting.\n\nI'm not even gonna bother watching the making of (Creating a Universe: The Making of Rebel Moon), because they haven't created anything out of ordinary (hopefully YET) to see a documentary about it.\n\nWhole movie (both parts) feels like it's too long and also too short to get a sense of development and depth in many parts of new Zack Snyder's world.\n\nGiving it a 3/5 but only as a continuation of Part One: A Child of Fire. Alone it's surely a lower ranking but still fun."

To kind of balance it out, the movie does have some great action sequences, but dangling some shiny keys in front of a pile of trash doesn't make it more appealing. Junkie is back at it again with trailer music score, sounds just like 3 of his other films. Do not listen to these reviews giving it 10/10, see it for yourself and judge."

The 300 meets Star Wars. The bad guys are truly bad and the good guys battle hard and struggle to triumph over evil.\n\nOne special effect that I really enjoyed from Part One, which continued into Part Two, the close up of the blasters as the director uses slowmo type of bullet-time, whereby you can see the lava laser bolt with the red glow of the round leaving the chamber and traveling away from the blaster. There is blowback sufficient to provide excellent suspended disbelief that blasters are actually being fired and exist.\n\nThe light swords appear to be lava for red lighted weapons and ice for blue lighted weapons and made of glass. It is like a lightsaber but different, ice/lava sabre, with the great illusion of actually penetrating bodies during combat.\n\n\"Green screen\" is well executed in this production. There is definitely no \"low budget\" feeling at all.\n\nI recommend this movie for its combat scenes, pyrotechnics, cinematography, and visual FX!\n\nPay attention during the slow scenes as you may lose the overall perspective."

It's a movie that has enjoyable aspects, cheesy aspects, cheap aspects and good/bad aspects. You might even call it a popcorn space opera film. I think there is progress after the first movie. The first movie was more messy. The fact that the movie takes place in a single location this time is also a factor in this.\n\nSeriously, the guy who made this movie loves slow motion, I understand a lot of people don't enjoy it that much.

However, I wonder how someone like Zack Snyder, who repeatedly makes such disastrous films that are publicly available to everyone, still gets multimillion-dollar projects and executes them to a terribly catastrophic quality. And what does Netflix do? They throw more millions at Zack with no expectations. The second thing is that so many people worked hard on this film, only to produce crap in the end because Zack had free rein. This is just mind-boggling to me."

Part Two is an improvement in that we learn more about our merry band of \"Seven Samurai\", as they share their formative background stories. The upshot is that these previously one-dimensional characters are now two-dimensional. In addition, I think Part Two is less blatantly derivative. This may sound like faint praise, but I honestly appreciated the improvement, and some credit is due. However, the characters in these films are merely there to provide sufficient story context for a bunch of CGI.\n\nThe visuals are good, just like in Part One, but with more explosions. The defensive prep of the village was well done. It's nice to see people use their brains and come up with a plausible strategy (kind of rare in movies). So more credit is due.\n\nI enjoyed this movie; I think it rates 6.5 stars on that basis. However, I'm deducting a half-star for semi-predictability. That makes six (6) stars total.\n\nPS The lack of powered (or automated) farming tools (aside from a stake-bed hover-platform) is puzzling. It's supposed to show some pseudo-Amish quality-of-primitive-life, but anyone who has actually done that kind of work will tell you (better) TOOLS give you quality of life. Granted, they had a mill, but carefully avoided showing the power source (hmm). Anyone who thinks subsistence farming is \"fun\" is delusional; mechanized agriculture is responsible and necessary for modern (middle-class) life; without it you have a neo-feudal society at best (which GRANTED is what they're depicting, but better tools would be in EVERYONE'S best interest, and are clearly feasible in a society that can make dreadnoughts, sentient/sapient robots, and hover-boards)."

This is the case for Rebel moon, the series of movies were announced, even before the first one came out. Now, Rebel Moon Part two: The Scar giver is out, it is directed by Zack Snyder, and stars Sofia Boutella from Kingsman: The Secret Service, Ed Skrein from Deadpool, and Michiel Huisman from Game of Thrones.\n\nKora (Sofia Boutella) goes back to her hometown; there she and the rest of the villagers prepare to fight against the mother world to keep their grain.\n\nBack in the day, Snyder wanted Rebel Moon to be a Star Wars movie for Disney. Luckily, Disney did not go along with the idea, especially since Rebel Moon is a bad movie. It is boring, and there was no reason to make Rebel Moon two or more parts.\n\nPart one of Rebel Moon was not particularly good ither, all Kora did was go to different planets, to get warriors to help fight along side the farmers. I was hoping part two would be a little better, since they would have to have a battle. Yes, towards the end there was fighting, but I do not care about any of the characters. The only two characters that had a little intrigue were the little boy and the robot. The boy, for some reason, has a connection with the girl that has a light saber looking like weapon. In part one Jimmy (Anthony Hopkins), also known as the robot, was on the wrong side of the fight. As the movie went on however, he changed sides, which was one of the only interesting things in a boring movie. In the first half of part two, I wanted to fall asleep. All they did was farm, which seems like a waste of time, especially in a movie.\n\nSnyder has made it clear that he wants to make an entire Rebel Moon universe, with six films. I find this very funny, since these two movies do not have anything in common with other good franchises, such as Star Wars or Lord of the Rings. These movies provide world building and take time to get to know the characters. Whereas Rebel Moon Part two: The Scar Giver will only give you boredom."

From that movie to 300 I've followed this directors evolution. The DC films I enjoyed. Suckerpunch wasn't the best but it really was unique. Once he made an open ended deal with Neflix though it was too much. Just like Shyamalan with Sixth Sense he was able to basically do pet projects. M Night came out with a few stinkers until he was humbled a bit by fans. Honestly even Nolan's Tenet was just too much to be enjoyable. Ridley Scott's Napoleon was equally horrible. Now it's gonna happen but I sense it happens more often when a director is completely unrestrained. I feel between Snyder's goofy ass Army of the Dead which was a horrible mess of comedy, no edge like Dawn of the Dead to his recent terribly written and poorly cast Rebel Moon films. So cliche sci-fi world building just so bad. It like a fabulous looking gourmet meal but tastes bad and has no flavor. I mean at least add some edge to the film, some extreme violence or nudity. I mean I would expect this from JJ Abrams (except with lens flare and not slow mo). Very disappointed again with Scargiver. Some directors should explore their roots again and realize they can't always create fabulous source material from pet projects. Like what Peter Jackson did with LotR or Villanueva is doing with Dune please Zack get some awesome screen writers and build off their material.

What was better, the sex scenes with Sophia, and not for dirty reasons, however it showed different sides to her as the first scene was more just sex, however the second time was love. The increased violence, so it was slightly over done, was ok for much of the battles, but was required to repeat showing it again and again, it felt like over kill, and some does improve it, this just felt more horror shock gore at times. That didn't improve on the story, the opposite it dumbed it down in my opinion.\n\n80% of extra story, was not giving much that improved the story, only some of short backstories of some characters was good additions. Then the over use of slow motion that just added more time was also over done, I mean showing blood splatter in slow motion numberous times is a waste, but slow motion on collecting wheat is truly a waste!\n\nI prefer the original 2 with possibly a couple of these little editions only, so maybe 10-15 minutes added to each to cover the good editions of these 2 would of been enough.\n\nI absolutely loved both part 1 & 2, they were brilliant! I am very confused on the bad ratings, I am wondering if these are obsessed Star Wars fans that can't accept or appreciate some similar but different type of story that they have to cut this one down to saying it is awful?! Really?! These movies were so good, story original, action excellent and heartfelt.

I have a fairly decent set up with a moderately high end TV and 5.1 surround, which I only use early evening as the sound carries and I don't think want to annoy the neighbours. I started watching too late one evening with just the TV speakers and it didn't hold my attention, so I waited until I could watch with the full home cinema, and then i was rapt."

It may have worked for \"Justice League\" but I don't find that any version can save these. The screenwriting was tough and lacked a lot of depth, and I found it so easy to not care for a single character. Zack Snyder attempts to bring heavy emotion into the story and characters but it never lands. The editing was painful especially with the use of slow-motion and how overused it is, I got to the point where I was ready to turn the film off multiple times.\n\nOverall, there is very little to say of this film that I enjoyed if anything at all. A lacklustre, poorly inspired, wannabe Star Wars that I never had the time to care for, was just a disappointment."

Saying \"this is what my personality is\" does not count as character development. Exposition through a daisy chain of flashbacks does not mean you're following the golden rule of \"show, don't tell\".\n\nIf farming in slow motion and vomit inducing \"cinematography\" is your thing, you're in for a blast.\n\nTo give credit where credits is due...some of the actors tried very hard to have fun with the material, but this is beyond salvation. For a quirky alternative to star wars watch Krull instead.\n\nIf this is a dream project for Snyder, call Freddy Krueger."

The coolest moment was the James the mech with his cloak in his One Punch Man moment.\n\nHalf the movie was the farmers harvesting wheat and after one day of combat training got a better kill-death ratio than any of the veterans.\n\nThe other half of the movie was a guy turning the little wheel to aim the Dreadnaught cannon.\n\nRemind me never to watch any more Synder movies on Netflix.

Sure, there's a lot of things that are tacky, and not that well thought through...\n\nI think this is the first time that a SciFi movie have spent 20 minutes on harvesting... Some of the choices for providing backstory is just cringe, like \"hey, let's go round the table and tell our life stories\".\n\nA lot of the added scenes to make it look \"cool\" are even more cringe, lite someone running head first into a shower of bullets (lasers really) and then tosses an enemy over his shoulder... Said tossing over the shoulder leaves all hundreds of charging enemies so stunned that they forget to fire any more...\n\nThe number of slow-mo scenes makes this movie about 40 minutes longer that it would have been without them.\n\nConveniently for our hero's fighting with swords, when the enemies show up, they too have forgotten all rifles and firearms and come bearing swords too...\n\nThere's a scene for several minutes about riding an elevator while looking fierce by wrapping a sword handle that must go to the history for being the most ridiculous time filler ever.\n\nI also question a lot of the logic, I mean if you are dressed as an enemy soldier to blend in but then you decide to ditch all of that advantage to be able to instead walk the hallways in a white top, really sticking out like a sore thumb to the enemies... It probably looks better to reveal some skin and shiny muscles, but come on!\n\nSo, yes, a lot of bad choices form the director and waaaay too much effort to try and spice the scenes up, and unnecessarily I might add.\n\nThe actors are doing a good job, but the script is too weak, too little plot and \"finess\" to be able to carry two plus hours.\n\nIt's like they had only like one hour twenty minutes of good movie, but Netflix had ordered at least 2 hours so they had to add a lot of extra (=cringe) scenes and a ton of slow-mo to boot to stretch it out.\n\nOver all it's a good and viewable story, and I am actually looking forward to the third movie (because there will be one, trust me!) but I really, really, hope that they come up with some better storytelling and some more character development as I now have a hard tie rooting for the good guys..."

Only one thing regarding the story line, the main characters are talking about their past and why they are against the main kingdom. So you can know the history of them which makes a sense of why they are fighting against the kingdom. It has some more behind the stories than protecting the moon village.\n\nAnyways as an overall I would give 7 out of 10 because part 1 has been leveraged by this and mostly this obe has better actions. Just to spend your lesuire time with an action movie this is quite a good one and also if your are into future galactic civilization things like \"Foundation\" by Isaac Asimov, then this movie is not that bad but start from part one."

The Scargiver takes all of the world building from the first, adds significantly more to the story and characters, and tops it off with an epic battle sequence.\n\nEverything great about the original is continued here. The beautiful visuals, amazing music and goosebump-inducing slow-motion shots. It's more Snyder being Snyder, and I'm nowhere close to being sick of it. For me, it's delicious.\n\nThe part that stands out the most is how ridiculously invested I was in the wellbeing of the characters and the outcome of the story. I was on the edge of my seat, legitimately nervous and worried. And to make it even more impactful, this movie is emotionally powerful. It gave me the feels more than once.\n\nIn conclusion, The Scargiver is highly entertaining, awesome, intense and fun.\n\nDirector's Cut: With the director's cut of part one, I didn't feel the extra 90 minutes. I enjoyed it all. But with this one I could feel the time much more, even though it's only 50 minutes longer. This could be because part one had action scattered throughout. With part two, the majority of the action is in the third act.\n\nI still think I'd go with the director's cut of part two for the unrestricted viewing. Slo-mo blood spatters are pretty, lol.\n\n(2 viewings, 4/19/2024, 8/3/2024)"

All the action you want, a great hissable baddie, heroes, heroines, even a robot with a conscience. Worth watching both parts, although hardly original, still, if action and battles are your thing then this is for you. Think Battle Beyond The Stars with a massive budget. Recommend you see part one before part two, even though they are stand alone movies, and if you can, give Battle beyond the Sars a look as well. The 6 score is overall for both films."

I'm not a great fan of Rebel Moon Part One, but it was acceptable. Part Two, however, is mostly just bad and boring. If Zack Snyder's intention was to produce a strong sedative, he accomplished the mission with excellence. I consistently had the impression that someone had a script with lots of checkpoints, and that's it. On top, just imagine for a moment that some skilled warriors and some peasants want to fight the forces of the USA or NATO... Anyway, the production is solid. If you don't mind a mind-numbing story and only watch the action sequences (especially the prolonged battle in the last act), you may find a little entertainment while saving some of your lifetime. In my opinion, Part Two is a new all-time low in the oeuvre of Mr. Snyder. Is this still the same director who made movies like the remake of Dawn of the Dead, 300, Watchmen, and Sucker Punch? If yes, what happened to his skills and taste? One last note: the most fun I had was discovering which scene or idea was borrowed from which other movie..."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm happy to have waited for a while to watch both movies, directors cut. After the fiasco of the Justice League, it made sense to watch it as the director saw it. Well, to sum it up, if was to define both movies, its a Frankenstein monster. It has taken parts from many movies, such as the magnificent seven, Star Wars etc, but the glue that suppose to flawlessly connect between these parts just isn't there.\n\nThe good.\n\nI generally like Snyder's movies and his slow-motion action effects. Loved the fights in these two movies. The gore and special effects add much to the experience.\n\nThe mediocre.\n\nSofia Boutella actually got the looks to be considered bad ass girl warrior. But in my opinion, it's just not enough to be considered the main lead. She just doesn't have that screen presence to be considered the lead. Quite often she disappeared from attention while the camera wasn't focused specifically on her. She can be a great fit to act as second to lead, but no lead herself.\n\nSex scenes are absolutely unnecessary. It's a space movie. Showing sex scenes within some Mormon/Hippie community just doesn't fit.\n\nThe bad.\n\nAs mentioned before, it's a Frankenstein. The story in general make little to none sense at all. They mixed up some delusional Mormon\\Hip[pie community, space wars (on the ground), profound robot/humanity realizations, pure evil that have sex with tentacles and more, into something that really can't connect. That is the main problem with both of these movies.\n\nSo to sum it up, I'd give these two movies a 5/10, just for the fights and the effects. Also, would really like to see more of Sofia Boutella, just not in the lead."

Intriguing worldbuilding helped keep my attention, it would have been nice to see more of the universe that serves as this movie's backdrop. It also has a great cast that did their best with what they were given. And there ends the positive things I have to say about Rebel Moon.\n\nThe dialogue was predictable, shallow, and just oh so weak. Speeches meant to be inspiring left me feeling slightly embarrassed, it really is as if they were written by a teenager, and not one of the talented ones. The plot was flimsy at best, the motivations of most characters took an extreme suspension of disbelief.\n\nAnd the terribly unimaginative clich\u00e9s! The Korean sword master from a fishing village? How could they proudly display such little creativity?\n\nOverall, I'm glad I watched this movie but I would never recommend it. It's good to watch on a lazy day, the action and visuals are pleasing, but please don't watch this movie expecting to feel something deeper than entertainment."

Because there is no way Netflix gave $160 M for this B rated movie with A list actors.\n\nScriptwise it's like torture, did a 10 year old wrote the script for this movie? Everything in the movie is just like a salad of hot mess. It looks as if director cherry picked from dozen of sci-fi movies and planted it all here withiut any direction, timeline etc. He just shoveled cut offs from stuff he'd seen and decided hey it will be ok here. Watching this mess for 2 hours was a torture on my eyes, ears and my brain had to emergency shutdown for the rest of the evening.\n\nStory +0.1 Script minus -10 Computer Animation +8 SlowMo minus -1000 like what???\n\nI want to stress about my rating, we love movies, we watch tons, we are movie buffs. I do not leave low reviews, like nothing ever lower than 5. Mostly I give 8,9 or 10. But those are movies not a salad with slowmo everything and zero story with horrific script.

        "review_detailed_main": "Yes, the plot is very basic, you've seen it before a bunch of times. The acting is pretty bad and some of the costume choices are questionable. But the visuals and the action scenes are very good. Watch on a good TV with a good Sound system. Keep your remote handy and fast forward through all the Various montages (you'll recognize them when you see them). That way you don't have to tolerate the ridiculous dialogue and can enjoy action and visuals that Marvel used to do.\n\nI'm not sure what Zack Snyder was trying to do with this movie. We've got western, sci-fi, steam punk etc. It's all a bit strange. He should definitely stick to his day job as a Director and give up on screenwriting. However, I found the fight scenes well choreographed and the CGI and visuals actually added to the movie. I will say that Ed Skrein stands out in this movie as the evil Admiral. He steals every scene that he's in. He knows he's in a cheesy sci-fi movie and plays it perfectly.\n\nSure, I would've liked a better story, better acting, etc, but it's a decent Saturday night popcorn movie. Just don't feel that you have to waste time on scenes that slow down the pacing (and there are more than a few). I think that's what most people are complaining about. Just skip them. I promise you will not lose the plot by doing this. It does culminate into a pretty decent finale.\n\nAnyway, that's my take. It's a two hour movie that I watched in less than an hour and a half. I would apply this same strategy to part I, though I spent less time fast forwarding through that movie. Obviously, it's been set up for a Part III. I'll have my remote handy. \ud83d\ude09"

        "review_detailed_main": "If Rebel Moon Part One felt like Zack Snyder trying to make a self-parody, Part Two just feels like a total squandering of the talents I know he possesses with all his worst trademarks as a director on full display. The film doesn't do anything to build upon the few things that intrigued me from the first part and it just makes this whole \"experience\" feel like a complete waste of time in retrospect.\n\nPart One felt like a complete exposition dump to set up for this film yet the first hour is still devoted to filling in the blanks of this totally uninteresting world and characters. The dialogue is at best forgettable and at worst completely self-serious without a hint of self-awareness that made a lot of the character interactions cringeworthy more than anything. That first half was excruciatingly boring without any kind of tension building, the actual plot essentially revolves around farming grain and it's about as interesting as it sounds. When the war both these films have been building towards finally comes to ahead it feels like a relief in all the wrong ways because I was just happy to see something meaningful finally happen.\n\nWhen I say the second half was an improvement that's not really saying much but at least I was moderately entertained. The last hour is essentially a non-stop battle and while it can devolve into visual noise after a while at least it feels like Snyder in his element. The pacing finally picks up and there's actually a few interesting visuals on display with some genuinely entertaining sequences. But after a combined 3-hour build up I think it all came a bit too late for me. Writing really isn't Snyder's strong suit and in future I'd prefer to see him either stick purely to directing or adapting material because that seems to be where all of his best work comes from.\n\nWhen all is said and done, Rebel Moon represents a colossal misfire for Zack Snyder as a director. I didn't think Part One was a good movie but I had a modicum of hope that The Scargiver would give us some good pay off that would make these movies feel worthwhile. The whole thing just ends up being a massive slog and it's not nearly entertaining enough to make up for how hugely derivative it is. Rather than feeling like a complete story, this movie ends with set up for yet another sequel that I don't know if I have the energy to endure, Snyder fan or not."

You begin to think maybe there is hope. And then right at the 40th minute mark (i.e. Almost the middle of the SECOND movie) a character stands up and asks that he wants to know the people he's about to fight side by side with. This in turn prompts a montage that is narrated by each character reading his or hers wiki page. That is of course in case the poor viewer has already forgotten the first movie and the fact that the same characters have already fought side by side with one another and have had the same introductions except the first time we didn't get a montage. I guess Zach Snyder knew that for part 2 WE ARE GONNA NEED A MONTAGE! Montage....\n\nAfter this action begins to ensue with all the tropes you can think off - from dumb evil guys being dumb and evil to the power of friendship that beats everything.\n\nOh, and slo mo, because where would we be without it."

Q. Is the Wheat Superpowered and gives you temporary Superpowers every time it's eaten, so that you can continue and make it even easier to conquer other planets? A. No it doesn't do that, it's just Regular Wheat. Q. What? That's it? Wait, Hold on a Minute....\n\n\ud83c\udf13 - Q. Can't this Intergalactic Empire Make other types of food? Can't they find other food sources somewhere else in the Galaxy? A. No, they can't, but there's something about that wheat though, I'm telling you.\n\n\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb - The Village has around 200 people. Q. Well that's good, should be an easy defeat if things go sour right? A. Well no, the Villagers have Better Battle Tactics, such as digging ditches underground, and making underground tunnels, so they can surprise attack the Empire. Q. What? I thought this Intergalactic Empire has Superior Weapons, Equipment, Armour, Land & Air Vehicles and Tactically Trained Soldiers? A. Yeah, but the Villagers have Pitchforks, a couple of Rocket Launchers, Some Musket Guns, Axes and Swords. Q. What? Are you joking? A. No.\n\nDo you get the Picture?\n\nMore Buffoonery -\n\n\ud83d\ude47 - The Final Battle was Ridiculous with the Numbers and lack of numbers on the other side, and it also turned into Star Wars Point Blank Misses by Storm Troopers Stuff.\n\n\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb - The Bridge Battle with Tarak, General Titus & The Villagers was an absolute Embarrassment of a Watch. Watch the Celebration Aftermath \ud83c\udf89of that battle, with the villagers holding damn Melee Weapons in their hands after beating Assault Rifled armed Soldiers. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\n\n\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb - Tarak is running around with 2 damn axes, whilst Red Laser Gunfire Beams are flying all around him and not a single bullet hits him? It reminded of how stupid the Storm troopers were in the Star Wars Films.\n\n\ud83d\ude02 - It got to a point where it became an absolute Laugh of a Watch. Atticus Noble decides to destroy the grain \ud83c\udf3e because Kora is there at the village? But what about all that fuss noble kicked up at the village in part 1?\n\nThings I actually liked about the film -\n\n\ud83c\udf0c - The Visual Effects During the Battles were Great, I really liked the shots and the choices of the framing and it looked Stunning at times, with Smoke, Dust, Lighting & Slow Motion. The Hallway Gunfire scene with kora was good and the Jump by Kora in Slow Motion with the Handgun was Great to see.\n\n\ud83d\udc4d - The Backstorys of some of the characters, I would like to see more of that because it's actually better than this current time line.\n\n\ud83d\udc58 - Again on the Backstorys, the Costume Designs were Eye Gazing, absolutely beautiful costumes, coupled with the gorgeous cinematography & Visual Effects.\n\n\ud83d\udc71- So Princess issa was the one to dismantle all War Operations of the Motherworld, but Balisarius was not happy with this New Direction at All. And made Drastic Plans with Many other Nobles within the Empire. This Plot Point is so good. Is Princess issa the Key to a New Motherworld? \"I Forgive You\" - Did issa say that to Kora, knowing of Koras Forced Betrayal, yet also knowing the true extent of her Powers, Knowing the Pull Through and that all is not Over?\n\n\ud83c\udf81 - I liked the Gifts scene when the young villager girl gives Kora & her companions gifts during the party \ud83c\udf89\n\nOverall, other than some of the Visual Effects and Close Shots(which I liked) in certain Scenes, the actual premise is so laughable that it turns into sheer Buffoonery. Get some drinks and some of your friends around. And there's that side of the entertainment factor."

Snyder at the outset never did himself any favors by espousing how 'original' his take on Kurasawa canon was when others like John Sturges & recently Antoine Fuqua managed to take his samurai epic & transplant it to the old West but even if you're argument leans on his melding samurai adventures w/a sci-fi aesthetic, sorry Roger Corman got there first w/1980's Battle Beyond the Stars."

This put me to mind of the other magnificent flop movie Heaven's Gate, which had musical and dance sequences way out of proportion to the main body of the film at hand. So many heroes and we must also sit and listen to their backstories which go on endlessly. I'm glad they didn't have a DOZEN heroes, or the movie might have been 4 hours long.\n\nThe final battle was capable, though. There hasn't been quite so much slow motion since 1999 (Matrix). The battle CGI was of higher quality than some of the other places where, like the resuscitation of Noble (which looked like a Residents video, incidentally), it seemed added as an afterthought. They don't scratch film any more, you know.\n\nThe plot is quite turgid and people formerly though killed keep reappearing healthy, including a princess (we learn at the end). Clearly a device to make a 3rd episode possible.\n\nIt's clearly worth a watch just for all the ultimate noise and commotion. My one disappointment is that Anthony Hopkin's robot doesn't get to do a whole lot in the 4 hour runtime of the franchise. I was hoping he'd turn out to have unexpected powers or hidden secrets, but he's just another cast member of a too large cast.\n\nI will watch the next one, if it shows up. Once."

There's a semi decent story in there some where, I'm sure, but it's lost and buried deep under too much exposition and fluff. Even Anthony Hopkins' voice over at the start was horrific. The guy hasn't got the right voice for it anymore. Sounded like he was reading. Over 2 hours of your life you won't get back. Wouldn't recommend."

The people were stupid. The strategies were stupid. The motivations were stupid. The technology was stupid. The economics were stupid. The politics were stupid. Everything in this story was stupid. I understand they wanted to remake Seven Samurai, but they basically took the samurai, removed their fighting skills, gave them a compulsion for overtalking and gave them stupid laser guns. And the ending was spectacularly stupid, as it was revealed that they risked everything to defend a village, when there were higher stakes involved.\n\nEven if you have no idea how to write, how difficult was it to set up a realistic battle with a military instructor. Just give the guy some money and he will tell you what they would do if they had a bunch of soldiers backed by a few tanks and several flying gunships or if they were besieged by the same and all they had were guerilla fighters. I can suspend my disbelief in the story if you show you actually gave a damn about the rest. Or you can set up really dumb scenes if you have a good story. But if you have none of those, why even try?!\n\nWhat is even worse, many of the events in the second part invalidated much of the first. The more I wrote in this review, the more stars I removed. I wanted to say that the naysayers were a bit harsh and it was a watchable movie, but then my brain switched back on. This wasn't even entertaining. It was boring, pretentions and overwhelmingly stupid. Agh!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Lately, Zack Snyder films come across as dubious, \"what-if\" case studies rather than entertaining popcorn blockbusters. The Rebel Moon sequel that no one except Snyder asked for, is currently streaming on Netflix. It quite seems like the next batch of bland, forgettable films that'll enter the same league as the dreadful Transformers sequels. Part Two begins with Sir Anthony Hopkins' voiceover summing up the events of the first flick in a few lines. Snyder then takes a long time detailing Admiral Noble's resurrection (yawn!) and the village of farmers going about their business of cinematically harvesting grain. Snyder (who also puts on the DOP's hat) shoots them like music videos, lens-flaring the hell out of everything. Unlike the first, the action here unfolds mostly during the day, so the dark industrial grey aesthetic is almost replaced with what looks like a dusty, twilight-hour palette.\n\nIt takes exceptionally bad writing for the screenplay to focus less on what was supposed to be a \"battle for grain\" and turn into a Star Wars knockoff. That was already an issue with the first film, and nothing really changes here. The warriors supporting Kora in her quest to defeat Noble each get five odd minutes of a music-video-backstory, and I couldn't wait for the (long-ish) first act to just get over and move on to the action. The story arcs are terrible, the character development is bleh, and none of the performances are rousing. The film stays emotionally flat from start to finish - the stakes feel next to none, the deaths of key characters leave no impact.\n\nAgain, with writing this derivative and barebones, there's nothing Junkie XL could've done to make the proceedings any better. While nothing to write home about, the set pieces in the sequel feel less choppy (a typical Netflix trait) and even the excessive slo-mo didn't bother me all that much. In 2024, the same year where Dune: Part Two exists, it'd take a beyond-superlative effort to mesmerize audiences with a colonial space-warfare story. I acknowledge that Snyder is purely a \"visual\" director, and his writing efforts have been atrocious for the most part, but can the man learn a thing or two from his earlier big-budget mistakes, maybe?"

I have rarely watched a movie stacked with so many action scenes while being totally bored.\n\nIf you are not a Zack Snyder fan and need more reasons to hate his work, I highly recommend that you watch Rebel Moon - Part 2.\n\nI gave the first movie a 6.5 because I was entertained.\n\nThis one is a 4.5 at best."

This is where she gets to understand why Balisarius spared her life when she was taken from her world when she was 9yrs old. My other favorite part is the scene is where Titus discussed the preparation of their defense and strategy. The other scenes I enjoyed was when Titus and the other warriors told their stories and their reasons why they are determined to fight for revenge for what they all lost. I believe Ed Skrein role as Admiral Atticus Noble as the villain, he performed it superbly with passion. He deserves an award for his well played role. And to add, it's so amazing how the director choose the casts who are qualified as actors, and well experienced in theater acting. And majority were born in the 80's just like me. \ud83d\ude1c"

The second one didn't even have that going for it.\n\nI literally found myself watching YouTube videos while it was playing in another tab, it was that boring.\n\nThe dialog was terrible. The pacing was terrible. There was character development, but that character development was so formulaic that it was almost comical. Yet, I think that what bothered me the most was the juxtaposition of sentient androids with WWII style naval guns on a SPACESHIP!\n\nI mean, what sort of civilization can build sentient androids and build faster than light spaceships and still can't build a decent targeting computer!? Who?!\n\nAnd the grain as a plot device!? Sure, sure, grain worked as a McGuffin in 7 Samurai, but that's because the film took place in an agrarian society! If a civilization can build robots and spaceships and has a power source capable of traversing lightyears of distance in mere days, then one would think that they'd be able to automate something as mundane as food production.\n\nI can't tell you how many articles I've read about lab grown 3D printed meat in the past few years. Not to mention the fact that you can buy Impossible Burger at the supermarket for the same price as real meat (of course, real meat would probably be twice the price without the corn subsidies...).\n\nMy willful suspension of disbelief has hereby been revoked.

        "review_detailed_main": "We've had some jarring cliffhangers over the years (Star Wars, Matrix series, that Hunger Game Catching Fire stunner), but two in a row? In bad movies, in a mess of a series of films? No thanks.\n\nIf you were hoping part 2 was going to redeem part 1...uh, no.\n\nZach Snyder's films look cool. No denying that. There's a following. That's indisputable.\n\nBut all of his films (with him writing in particular) have story, plot and dialogue issues. This film is no different.\n\nThere is so much exposition (indiscriminately dropped in) that the main story comes to a screeching halt every time. And that exposition? Stupid. Rehashed dull crap.\n\nIf you have never seen the several versions of Seven Samurai, watch any of them for a better play on the central plot in this film. George Lucas and others have already plundered great Japanese film epics and retreaded spaghetti westerns to develop science fiction films hundreds of times. The modern audience is wise to this, and there is so much content out there that they can smell lame junk from the back row.\n\nThere are too many coincidences, too many holes in the plot, too much lame dialogue (that some of the actors had HUGE difficulty delivering) and too many forced attempts at shock and awe.\n\nIt's a shame really. The small story idea around a rogue android gone wild is given scant service and little screen time. That story, expanded upon, could have been amazing. As it stands he shows up to save part of the day, and it's telegraphed from miles away. And the voice work for the Android is not right for his part. Feels like a strange homage to C-3PO.\n\nIf you finished Part I wondering why all these heroes were willing to risk their lives to rescue a backwater agricultural village on an unremarkable planet... and why an all powerful evil empire would waste resources on it... well, you're going to be seriously disappointed with the answer. Because it's a gigantic nothing burger.\n\nUsually folks stick around in an action movie to watch the bad guy get clobbered. Well, not here. The front and center space nazi (brought back from the dead twice?) gets an important part of his body cut off by the heroine. But because this is the PG-13 cut, all of that takes place off screen. So no visual confirmation that the bad guy died. Lame.\n\nAnd the big bad? The guy who has been giving all the orders, and brought nazi-Ned back from the dead? He never shows up. Ridiculous.\n\nOne of the biggest gripes I have with Snyder's films is that there is no comic relief. They all want to be taken so seriously that there is no joy when a hero succeeds, or a villain is defeated. It becomes more about reflecting on the loss and damage to arrive at the end result. Such a bummer.\n\nAnd the ending? Nope. Another cliff hanger. Will there be a part 3? Please no.\n\nSo cue it up, watch it, shake your head, and then go watch The Seven Samurai."

        "review_detailed_main": "As someone who's long admired Zack Snyder's work, diving into \"Rebel Moon\" was an experience I was eagerly anticipating. Yet, from the opening scenes to the closing credits, I found myself grappling with a profound sense of disappointment. The expectation of embarking on another epic journey, similar to Snyder's past triumphs, quickly faded, replaced by a realization that this was not the masterpiece I had hoped for.\n\nThe casting, usually a strength in Snyder's projects, felt off this time around. Despite the presence of some notable names, the performances were lackluster, failing to captivate or convey the emotional depth typically associated with his films. It was as though the actors were not fully invested in their roles, or perhaps the direction failed to extract the best from this ensemble.\n\nThe narrative itself was another point of contention. Where Snyder's storytelling has often been praised for its complexity and depth, \"Rebel Moon\" presented a plot that felt superficial and unengaging. The storyline seemed to meander without a clear direction, leaving me yearning for the layered narratives I've come to expect from his work.\n\nComparing this to watching a short film on Dust - an outlet I admire for its innovative and thought-provoking content - might seem like an odd juxtaposition. However, the expectation for a Netflix and Zack Snyder collaboration is naturally set at a much higher bar. Dust shorts, while entertaining and insightful, operate within the realm of independent filmmaking, often with limited resources. In contrast, a project like \"Rebel Moon,\" backed by Netflix's considerable resources and Snyder's visionary direction, should transcend these limitations.\n\nYet, the experience felt akin to watching one of those shorts, where the constraints are palpable, and the scope is inherently limited. This isn't to discredit Dust's contributions to the sci-fi genre but rather to highlight the disparity in expectations. From a powerhouse duo like Netflix and Zack Snyder, one anticipates a cinematic experience that pushes boundaries and sets new standards, not one that merely echoes the feel of an indie short film.\n\nIn sum, while \"Rebel Moon\" might have had the potential to be another jewel in Zack Snyder's crown, it ultimately fell short of the mark. It's a stark reminder that even the most successful filmmakers can sometimes miss the target, leaving fans like myself in a state of reflection on what could have been."

Life is now complete.\n\nOverall, while it had some pretty shots and VFX, it was a lacklustre experience with too many narrative and pacing problems to move it much past the 5* mark. These last two movies are why Zack Snyder is a director that needs someone to reign him in from time to time.\n\nSnyder once said he doesn't use slow-mo that much, but this movie alone has enough slow-mo that you could play four of five action movies by other directors, and they would still have less than this one does."

        "review_detailed_main": "This was more of a rant than anything, it's not like Snyder is going to read this and take it to heart. As a director, at what point do you actually sit back and reevaluate your filmmaking? I ask this, because Zack Snyder doesn't seem to care, or even try to learn and improve from missteps - such as an over reliance on slow-motion. I say this as a viewer that always hopes for a director to turn out a good product. But aside from a few okay extended cuts, his films have been largely misses.\n\nIf you are reading this, you might've already made up your mind as to whether or not you'll view this sequel. I'm just here to vent like almost everyone on the internet. The Scargiver is somehow worse than its predecessor, and also less exciting. There is a core concept that seems to be interesting despite multiple elements being lifted from properties such as Star Wars. Which makes it even worse knowing that it's squandered. Such as character development, and overall plot structure.\n\nNow, I know Zack Snyder trolls will say, \"Just wait for his extended cut. That's when it gets good\". Problem is, there's nothing about this \"franchise\" that would justify, or improve the movie to warrant an extended cut. Zack Snyder shouldn't make his name being a director that makes good extended cut - he hasn't earned it. It's just a marketing gimmick for himself and his followers. Even then, some of his extended cuts are simply 'fine'. If you can't make some sort of coherent product on the first initial cut, then you probably aren't cut out to be a director.\n\nI say this as someone who wants to see him succeed. By all accounts Zack Snyder seems like a nice man with a signature visual flare. What he needs is a good set of writers, and people to reel him in when he gets off the rails. I hope he moves on to different projects and gets his footing, but by all accounts, The Scargiver is part two in a franchise that's already exhausting."

As a long-time Snyder fan, I've admired his talent as a director with his distinct visual style, but unfortunately, Rebel Moon Part 2 falls victim to its dreadful script.\n\nThis movie is a disaster.\n\nThere are few good qualities in this chaotic mess of a film. The cast delivers reasonable performances given the material they're handed, and some action sequences showcase Snyder's prowess in that arena. Similar to Michael Bay, he knows how to handle action. However, any praise ends there.\n\nPart 2 is a tedious, uninspired, and ultimately futile mess. The first half retells what we've already endured in Part 1, with numerous scenes and flashbacks serving no purpose other than to elongate the runtime. The antagonist, whom I couldn't even summon the effort to look up, is forgettable at best, similar of Captain Phasma from the Star Wars sequel trilogy - appearing, delivering a few lines, then promptly getting beaten and bashed.\n\nThere's little else to say about this film. It's a lackluster science fiction flick devoid of imagination, burdened by lackluster world-building, forgettable characters, and a narrative so unengaging you'd find more entertainment watching paint dry. It's annoying because Snyder has proven himself capable of greatness in the past. If further installments are going to be made, then they need to improve the script, because I would say I've seen better writing in Twilight.\n\nRating: 3/10."

To those who doubt Snyder's genius, this film is a definitive answer - a masterpiece that demands to be seen. So, to the haters, as the saying goes, 'su*** it, Gunntars!' Get ready for a cinematic journey like no other, because Zack Snyder has once again raised the bar."

This was famously Zak Snyder's attempt at making a Star Wars movie but Disney was smart enough to turn him down, so he very thinly disguised the Star Wars elements and made it anyway. So it's just bad Star Wars. But beyond that his whole new idea to freshen up the Star Wars universe? A bad Seven Samurai remake. So something that's already been done mixed a something else that's already been done. Pointless.\n\nNow saying it was Underdeveloped is a soft criticism. Snyder has his own extended cuts of these films that may correct some of the TERRIBLE pacing, but I can't see that being enough. This felt like someone shot an entire 8 Episode series and condensed it into 2 movies. And frankly, Snyder is just not a good writer. In fact, he's quite bad. I think he is a great director, he can make things look good, but this was just embarrassing at times. The battle scenes felt like a bunch of 8 year old's playing war in their back yard. So much of this movie was stuff presented as being very important with nothing to make the audience feel that way. There are cinematic cues that imply a feeling, but no information. Like all of the stuff with the robot being presented all dramatically. Who was he again? Someone who was mentioned for 3 seconds in the first movie? You can cue the music and people can gasp, but I'm still confused.\n\nMaybe I'll give em another try when Snyder releases his versions, but as it stands these two movies are just bad."

With cringe worthy dialogue, an unbelievably annoying villain and yet again a predictable chain of events, this film flopped miserably.\n\nI am guessing both films were filmed simultaneously for there were no improvements whatsoever from the backlash of the first film. Most performances were weak and over dramatic, a lot of which in my opinion is due to the writing. I had numerous points in the film where I laughed uncontrollably while supposedly serious scenes were taking place.\n\nKora's narrative for this entire film was to earn herself redemption for her previous actions and by doing so maybe start a new, peaceful life. That's why in her moment of truth she completely abandons her moral plans and has a change of heart. Her character was written to be a selfless hero, but to me came out as a pretentious bore.\n\nMore of the same. Visually boring, bad writing and bad performances. Again, the ending is meant to set up more sequels that I believe won't happen. Not recommended."

Not only does the script not make sense, it contradicts itself in some sequences. There's no character development to speak of, not only do they behave oddly and against their characters, it's written objectively, they just serve as tools for the next big scene. And that I think is the biggest problem with this film, you have no one to identify with, it's impossible, Mr. Director has made a moving poster for how he would imagine a sci-fi soap opera. The dramaturgy is absolutely non-existent, there was no one there to not only watch over the characters, the dialogue, but also the setting and the complexity of the scenes. The music is dysfunctional, absolutely monumental in the banal scenes, and conversely, in the powerful scenes, either weak or completely unemotional. It's sad to see the director of such a seminal pop culture film as Watchmen get to direct Rebel Moon. I hope no one gives him money for a third sequel... I don't think I can bear to see another slow-motion scene of an early-dead princess walking through a wheat field, and Mr. Snyder will be in the category of directors: hands off."

        "review_detailed_main": "So I survived it. This isn't one of the worst movies, and the visuals recommend it, but that's about it. The story simply didn't make any sense: You have a ruthless military man after just enough flour to keep his troops fed for a few days until he finds out that the moon is hiding someone he's been looking for. She grabs some soldiers to help defend the moon, and then it's their forces in opposition.\n\nThere's a lot of filler in the movie. Everyone has to harvest the wheat BY HAND because the good guys need to be as anti-tech as possible (despite their weapons, their cybernetics, their spaceships, and some meds) and that slow-motion montage is followed by weapons training that takes up less time (because they're hunters, I guess, even though some of these people have no idea how to hold a rifle).\n\nThere's even a section where everyone tells their background while sitting around that could have been handled by a few lines of dialog. Even the bad guy does stuff just so you'll know he's a bad guy; he's leader just because he's scary not because he's good at it.\n\nThe acting is all over the place: It's usually pretty good but that's mostly because of the actors, not the direction; they take what they have and go for it. The heroine and villain, however, must have gained twenty pounds each from the amount of scenery they ate; she's sad and moody and he's just vile, but between them, they just don't take their roles above two dimensions.\n\nYou just don't believe the soldiers were chosen for their training because they're just video game targets. The defenders are even worse because you see a lot of solo action rather than anyone really supporting one another; if they had, then the fight would have been a lot shorter.\n\nThe visuals are awesome, however. Everything looks great, there are some iconic moments, and it's gorgeous. I love their glowy swords more than those in Star Wars, the costumes were beautiful, and the griffins against spaceships were great. I just wish the tech felt more futuristic; I love steampunk, but powering ships through coal just felt weird.\n\nIn essence, this is what happens if you mashed the stories of Star Wars and Seven Samurai together and threw in elements of Jupiter Ascending. Incredible visuals, but it's missing so much else."

It's gonna look great, be action packed, contain slow-mo, and veer towards style over substance. It delivers on all counts. These are the components he uses every time, it ain't gonna change. If you expect anything else you should know better, that's YOUR fail, not Snyder's (unless he came over to your gaff and made you watch the film at gun point). It's a solid, entertaining two hours and a decent way to relax your way through an evening. 7.5 outta 10 rounded up to 8 for IMDB\n\nNow let's discuss the one star reviewers and 'worst film of all time, burn him at the stake, cut off his manhood, ban him from ever using a camera again' clowns who need to get a grip. I'm no Snyder fanboy. I will say that visually I do think he's a cut above the pack, but also think in other aspects he's definitely lacking. What I am a fan of though, is entertainment. Not every piece of film or TV has to make complete logical sense, or be grounded in absolute realism. Breaking down and critiquing the logic in an ACTION sci-fi film makes no sense. We are not talking about hard sci-fi here. This is no 'Arrival' or 'Interstellar' and neither does it claim to be. Stop being a killjoy and remember what it was like to have fun watching a film again. If you can't do that, then at least remember that if you see Snyder's name attached to something that you should know what to expect and if you don't want that, to give it a miss.\n\nLastly, let's stop pretending like Star Wars has more than two great movies (one of these is a prequel, which I'll leave unnamed just to annoy the worst breed of fanboy), and two great seasons of TV. Everything else is literally the same quality as the two parts of Rebel Moon, or considerably worse. I would watch this over ANY of the sequel trilogy any day."

So good you want to set a special night aside to watch it, switch off your phone, cuddle with your significant other, and enjoy a special treat. But it's such a huge disappointment. I went in absolutely wanting and expecting to love this. The special affects and design are gorgeous, Snyder's distinct action style is fun, if not particularly surprising anymore. But the writing...whew. What a heck of a bottleneck.\n\nEvery character is unequivocally flat in the least fun way. The script could have used a massive punch-up, because the dialogue is almost entirely utilitarian. If you like one-liners or just any expression of individualistic personality from a large ensemble cast, look much farther than here. The story feels incredibly reductive. Every character looks good on a marketing poster, but what you see is entirely what you get. The movie offers absolutely nothing from its characters beyond that first impression, and it's not the actors' fault--they're just not given anything to do that provides an opportunity to show any emotional range, hero and villain alike.\n\nThe story is equally one-dimensional and predictable. If you're a fan of fantasy/sci fi, there's nothing here you won't feel like you've seen a hundred times before, and what's more, it doesn't even feel like they tried. And I'm not criticizing what I see as a failed attempt at trying something new, or flipping a tired trope--I could respect a good effort. There's no impression at all that the creative team even wanted to break ground with this film. It's like they sat down to plan and said to each other, \"Let's go back to basics, guys--let's write like our audience hasn't seen a science fiction film since 1960.\"\n\nAgain, I want to stress that I went into this film biased in its favor. I wanted to find something, anything, to love about it, but just couldn't."

And the story is just a bit too dumb, just a star war over a farm, ridiculous.\n\nI sometimes think that some filmmakers just use such lame plots to have a reason to throw in fights, explosions and visual fx. It's not like before anymore where fx were used for world-building and immersion of a great story.\n\nLike someone wrote in a review for the first part, this movie seems like a Star Wars fan fiction of a high school nerd. This time there even was kind of a lightsaber fight, though in bad .. and they had the colors wrong, good is blue and red is evil, not the other way around. XD\n\nIf they really do more of this, I will pass. I watched the first and wasn't impressed. Now I watched this hoping it'll get better, but it didn't."

It is a mish mash of ideas from previous films with hideous writing that is extremely canned/trite and just nonsense frequently. Every character is one dimensional with no flavor. And the setup/scenario is absurd. Very advanced military characters fighting farmers which are a mix of Vikings and simpletons with some using ancient hand held weapons. Finally about 70% of the movie is simply fighting and an overdose of SFX. Netflix failed when they decided to fund, and probably with some big bucks, such a lackluster mess."

With a plot as thin as space dust, viewers are left adrift in a sea of confusion and disappointment. The narrative jumps from one disjointed scene to another, leaving audiences wondering if they accidentally boarded the wrong spaceship.\n\nCinematography? More like slow-motion overload. Every action sequence drags on longer than a black hole devouring a star, making even the most epic space battles feel like watching paint dry in zero gravity.\n\nForced character romances feel as genuine as a malfunctioning droid, and the acting is so wooden you'd think the cast was made of recycled spacecraft parts. When characters meet their demise, it's hard to summon even a pixel of emotion - a testament to how little the audience cares about their fate.\n\nRebel Moon 2 shamelessly pilfers elements from iconic sci-fi and fantasy franchises like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, but instead of paying homage, it feels like a cheap knockoff sold at a spaceport gift shop. It's a failed attempt to blend epic storytelling with interstellar adventure, leaving viewers wishing they could warp-speed out of the theater before the credits roll."

Even when the stereotypical love story arises during the conflict, it feels detached and unbelievable.\n\nOverall, the story falls flat and the slow motion is very overused like a podcast stuck at half speed. At some point you're just hoping it finishes quickly like that little league game you attended where your kiddo's team got smoked, your bleachers were silent, and you happily started thinking about the traffic on your drive home if you left soon.\n\nDo I recommend it?

No idea why anyone would think a longer version, called a Director's Cut, somehow makes a bad movie better. It does not! It only makes a bad movie longer. Rebel Moon is a collective mess. It copies parts of Star Wars, Gladiator, uses names from the Roman Empire, has bad guys with uniforms and marching boots modeled after Nazis, and adds a C3PO-type robot named Jimmy who ends up being a hero. The dialog at best is juvenile and only magnifies the poor acting from the second-rate actors selected to make this embarrassment of a film. Add in odd-looking aliens using British phrases like \"Oi,\" Irish folk music and dance which obviously originated from the Irish immigrants, and more blood and gore than in you would see in a slaughterhouse, and you have a ridiculously bad movie. The movie ending indicates there could be a potential Part 3, but why? One and Two were bad enough. Why waste more money and effort to create another awful movie."

Until the end, again.\n\nClich\u00e9 characters all around but bearable I think. I mean a movie to recrute the heroes must lead to something really good after, right?\n\nWell absolutely not. Because before going to this part two we need to go back to the part one. The end of part one lead us to a resolution that is taken away immediately, not even waiting for part two.\n\nYou can skip the last act of the part one, adjusting a few things (or not) and then start this part two. Nothing of value is lost (lol).\n\nThis part two is all visual (even then...) and no substance.\n\nSlow mo? Y o u g o t i t. Useless filling shot? Right. Not using the heroes that we spend one movie to recrute? Of course. Meaningful characters growth or something? Nope. A very unmotivated death, dumb even? Yes (the last one I don't care tbh). Ex machina? Nor really but close.\n\nIt's close to a parody tbh, you don't need to change much to get it. Sad because I can see the potential of Rebel Moon."

This movie is a lesson on how to do an entertaining action/sci-fi feature.\n\nHaters may hate but this movie certainly deserves to be a trilogy.\n\nIt's amazing how everyone involved has put in their ultimate best and it shows, especially the lead actress Sophia Boutella. I've seen her in a couple of action roles in the past but nothing as intense or as incredible as this. She's solidify her place as an action star to be reckoned with.\n\nNow for the movie itself, although the story is a bit thin, but everything else from the acting to breathtaking visuals and the heart pumping action at the climax (which by the way is one whole hour) is a pleasure to behold.\n\nI sincerely implore Mr. Zack Snyder and Netflix to ignore the haters and please give us the third part of this sci-fi action fest."

The slow mo, sweet Jesus, ZS came out and said it is his style he loves it, fair enough, it's not for me, I personally believe some shots it can make it awesome but every action scene every few shots just slows the movie way too much, it loses the flow and becomes boring.\n\nActing is fine, no improvement, some REALLY cool shots in this, the sky, the aesthetic itself is cool.

If you sit through Rebel Moons parts one & two,go back in time & watch Battle Beyond The Stars. It does what it takes two Rebel Moon films to do,& far better with characterizations,effects,& story that also was inspired by The Seven Samurai. And it only takes one film.

Others are screamingly awful, badly shot, rotten dialogue and characters doing plain stupid things. And Snyders usual slo-motion shots are so overused that it just becomes annoying.\n\nThere are so many inconsistencies in Rebel Moon that it so often just becomes completely jarring.\n\nFor example have Space ships with powerful weapons, but those weapons are seemingly targeted (very slowly of course) by turning a pulley wheel and looking through a visor....no laser guidance or even fast motor-drives on these space ships. Oh no.\n\nThe characters are attempted to be given backgrounds and depth but they all still appear as cardboard cutouts and real stars are the special effects which as superb & spectacular of course.\n\nIt really is just The Magnificent 7 with space ships and lasers but is less involving, more shallow and just left me empty after watching it.\n\nShame."

Personally, the first part left me wanting more. The second part was action packed from the get-go. I was standing up from the anxiety of what these characters were going through, rooting for and crying for them to the end. I cannot wait to see what the third installment will bring, how the remaining heroes will fair, and how our hero will bring peace to this entire galaxy."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver, is a near-incoherent, groan-inducingly predictable, and overly pretentious mess of an uncompromisingly bad movie.\n\nTo what little credit I can offer it, the CGI is convincing enough that it doesn't become distractingly noticeable, some of the actors look like they're trying with the little direction they're given, and the action can sometimes 'feel like' it looks cool.\n\nWith that now out of the way, the characters are all generic planks of wood who are described through dialogue alone as charismatic or brooding or kind, yet the movie can't really convince you in any other way. There's a blatant overuse of slow-motion that just comes off as either excessive, pretentious, or both. The character development is barely present, with the few characters who aren't as static given rushed arcs that won't help you remember their names. The antagonist from the first movie being resurrected is laughable, as it feels like it would have costed less time and resources in hiring someone more capable. The writing is downright awful, with characters repeating others' sentences or unsubtly expositing who they are without covering up the fact that it's an exposition dump. The action leaves a lot to be desired, with the choreography being less than impressive. The score is unmemorable and overbearing, acting as if this film is a sci-fi epic when in actuality it's less-than-impressive. Character decisions range from confusing to contradictory and adds to the overall idiocy of the script. The importance of the grain is supposedly the main objective of the antagonists, yet its importance is never really explained aside from being described as \"important\", which lessens the stakes or the genuine threat the Imperium is supposed to impose.\n\nIn summary, a movie that furthers my disinterest in the eventual director's cuts of the duology, due to the simple fact that regardless of the amount of possible satisfactory context they can offer, the score will still be overreaching, the story will remain equally as formulaic and the characters will remain just as bland."

Dialogues and remarks are obviously crafted to be dangerous and witty; but they're as hollow as dried gourds. Scenes of large-scale armed conflicts are miserably trivialized and reduced to victorious shouts reminiscent of tribal chants. The deaths of a couple of heroes are made-up to meet moral standards, and precisely because of that, instead of leading to apotheosis, they push the heroes into absurdity.\n\nRebel Moon part I - 4 stars.\n\nRebel Moon part II - 3 stars.\n\nRebel Moon part III - I hope they never make it!"

It's not original either, as you can pick up on many familiar things you have seen in other movies. It's no Lord of the Rings, Dune, Star Wars, and Game of Thrones.\n\nThere is a scene where all our heroes sit around and share their backstories. After someone finishes their back story, they might as well say \"OK, your turn.\"\n\nAnd when characters do bite the dust, I didn't care. You couldn't pay me to care about these guys.\n\nThere is an R-rated cut for Part One and Two that Snyder is trying to drum up hype for, but I highly doubt there's a good movie somewhere on the cutting room floor. And why is there a director's cut when this is a streaming release and not a theatrical release? Why didn't they release the R-rated cuts to begin with? Because nobody is campaigning like they did for Justice League. So, people have to watch (in total) a six-hour-long movie. Why!? So stupid, lol. And bold of them to think that I am watching both films again.\n\nZack Snyder is just like George Lucas, not a talentless hack, but he needs to stop surrounding himself with 'yes men'."

The big bad of the first movie returns and is equally big and bad and so comically stereotypical it feels like a monkey has written the script.\n\nThere isn't a huge amount redeeming for the movie, in theory the cast is pretty heavy hitting, but hugely let down by writing, plotline and plotholes. The visuals, as you'd expect with Zach Snyder are great but visuals don't make a movie good if you're lacking substance.\n\nOverall, it's not utterly awful.

Zack Snyder shoud have stopped with Sucker Punch, the only really good and original film he's made.\n\nWhat makes no sense? This evil nazi empire coming to steal the grain from a vilage across the galaxy. Even if they're really coming for Kora, why 15 minutes of scenes and speaches for tje vilagers gathering the wheat??? Everyone knows the wheat is not the goal, the empire and the vilagers. And that amoint of wheat cannot be held as any type of leverage for an entire empire. They'd have to spend mch more worth of fuel than the wheats' worth.\n\nSo no, it is not a good movie, very likely worse than part 1, I am writing this watching minute 38.....and OMG the clich\u00e9d dialogue, I threw up a little bit in my mouth every 5 minutes or so and there's 80 minites left."

        "review_detailed_main": "I liked this cut of Part 2 more than Part 1. The novelization of Part 1 was great and it is based on the director\u00b4s cut. I hope that the final films won\u00b4t lose too much of the crazy after being pushed through the MPAA to secure an R. The most impressive aspect of this film is the Junkie XL 10/10 score. The least impressive aspect is the weird timeline of events and clearly missing information. The living god engines called Kali are only introduced in the full version of Part 1 for example but also play a role here. A scene only in Part 1\u00b4s director\u00b4s cut is for example presented to have happened during the 5 days of prep the village has in Part 2 making at all seem less credible. Because it actually isn\u00b4t! A main character will also die differently in the director's cut, something Snyder revealed in a post-screening Q&A so we are once again being dealt a VERY compromised vision on release. AotD too had timeline issues but that film rocked while Rebel Moon simply plays. Well, the second half more or less rocks. Admiral Noble was my favorite character in Part 1 but is outshone in Part 2 by General Titus. The dialogue flips between very strong and exposition.txt to name something split down the middle. Kurt Johnstad & Shay Hatten are no Chris Terrio or even David Goyer but their dialogue worked well through V. Castro\u00b4s filter in the novel. Some of the cheese is of course intentional. Both Snyder and Lucas (the PT specifically) pay homage to source material and styles that were already ancient before the scripting began.\n\nAnd the action and cinematography? Mostly first class and the Vfx are equally strong! The current version\u00b4s one proper action scene is 50 minutes long. 300 on spray paint and chrome! Known action scenes in flashbacks are cut to almost nothing outside of Kora\u00b4s tale. To think that the real film will have an even longer climax, other action bits with varied settings and more complex balls-to-the-wall choreography that will push the gore as hard as the MPAA will allow, with Euro comic sex scenes on top. That\u00b4s why Snyder will never be out of work. No one squeezes blood from a stone like him.\n\nI wonder how much these films truly cost. If Snyder indeed managed to make 2 three hour films with alternative material (!) for 2 two hour cuts on top for only 80-something million apiece then he needs to win a Producer\u00b4s Guild award. 2 Rebel 2 Moon: Bigger Longer Uncut drops both parts at once in late summer to fall 2024. If it\u00b4s as good as the book then we have an all-time cult classic on our hands and this second half is already good enough. Bring on the sequels and spin-offs but I will add that the Black Axe prequel comics didn\u00b4t grab me. Part 2 gets a B- for now. Part 1 gets a C but not for long, its novel is a B+."

I wont spoil the ending but I reckon you can guess what happens.\n\nThere is a lot of characterisation padding, it could have been cut down to 1 movie leave your brain in the fridge and watch it then its an okay two parter.

        "review_detailed_main": "Recently, my wife and I have begun shopping at a different grocery store. While it has typically been a pleasant experience, I decided to try their store-brand version of Little Debbie's Cosmic Brownies. To my dismay, I was dissatisfied with the generic alternative and found myself wishing I had spent my time getting Cosmic Brownies instead. Unfortunately, I find myself facing an ironically similar disappointment today.\n\nRebel Moon- Part Two: The Scargiver is director Zack Snyder's second installment in his Netflix Original space opera. Despite Part One: A Child of Fire premiering in December 2023 to unfavorable reviews, Snyder and Netflix were already well underway on Part Two. While originally intending to create a trilogy of films, Snyder found it difficult to fit his vision in a typical 2 \u00bd-3hr runtime (an issue he had previously suffered from while directing DC Comic's Justice League) and decided to split each film into two parts. Now, at the start of a 6-part saga, the Rebel Moon universe attempts to cement itself as a sci-fi epic for the ages.\n\nPicking up shortly after the ending of Part One, we see our ragtag team of heroes regroup on Kora's (Sofia Boutella) adopted home world, the moon of Veldt. The group warns the locals of an impending attack from the Imperium, an unfortunate aftermath of their previous encounter. With only 5 days to prepare for the invasion, the team must work alongside the villagers to protect their town or die trying.\n\nRebel Moon- Part Two is unforgivably boring. Suffering from the sins of its predecessor, Part Two cannot handle its 2-hour runtime. While Part One was entirely set-up, the sequel stretches a finale into a full 2-hour film. Unbearably tedious, scenes drag on to questionable lengths, feeling as if there was little trimming done in an attempt to fluff the films runtime as much as possible. When that failed, an egregious amount of slow-motion was unnecessarily shoehorned into every scene. Matching Part One, there are about 45 minutes worth of slow-motion, which, if they had been cut, could have easily made this film more enjoyable. Rebel Moon- Part One & Two are not strong enough to stand on their own and would have greatly benefitted from being edited down into one complete film.\n\nBasing his vision off the Star Wars universe, Zack Snyder had stripped the world of any iconic and recognizable traits but failed to replace those with any of his own original or interesting ideas. Though you can clearly see where the inspiration came from, the lack of creativity holds the series back from forming a connection with its audience. Rebel Moon introduces characters, planets, and concepts that are truly difficult to remember or distinguish, as the entire film feels as if it is just placeholder for actual fully fleshed out ideas. Boiling Star Wars down to its most generic aspects, Rebel Moon is left feeling like a movie you would see playing within another movie.\n\nWhile the actors do their best to salvage the situation, they are held back by elementary-level dialogue and a paper-thin script. Suffering from telling, not showing, the film continually insists upon stating exactly how the audience should perceive each character, although we have never seen any of them portrayed to have those qualities. After two films and 4 1/2 hours, none of the characters stand out, with nearly all of them being completely forgettable if they aren't present on screen.\n\nContrary to this example, Zack Snyder truly is a talented director, but he desperately needs the guidance of a gifted writer. While he has had many successes in the past (300, Watchmen, Man of Steel) he had always worked closely with the respective writers to achieve that success. On his own, Snyder hasn't quite mastered the balance and the result is films like Rebel Moon. I do sincerely hope he continues making movies, but I hope he sees these flaws and learns from them before attempting something similar to this project.\n\nThe world of Rebel Moon was hindered before it began. Clinging to the idea of creating a Star Wars film, Zack Snyder held himself back from standing out and truly creating something original. Akin to a store-brand alternative to your favorite snack, Rebel Moon- Part Two: The Scargiver delivers a bland and unappealing attempt at copying an icon."

The action sequences, whilst we've seen them many many times before in better films are well staged and bordering on exciting, supported by seemingly hours of slow motion and a highly portentous score. On the downside, Snyder seems so eager to create his own galaxy far far away with associated history and lore he fails to create characters that will fill it - all they do is fight, roar as they charge into battle, make speeches and burst into tears, all without a scintilla of humour.\n\nBottom line, I just don't think I truly understood all this. The cause of the vast empire of soldiers attacking this little village still seems geared around getting grain - really? And the politics is rattled out quickly in a short section at the start - again I wasn't clear on this - perhaps I'm just not bright enough. Anyway it does seem as if Snyder is ready to make 2 more of these plus extended R rated versions of the first 2 parts are on their way - I'm so excited!"

I can actually see James the robot becoming a cosplay character. He was genuinely the best thing about this movie. All I can say is thank you for fast forward.\n\nI will give ZS the benefit of the doubt, his version of Justice League albeit 4 hours was the movie we as the consumer should have gotten the first time. RM2 had so much backstory montages, it's like this was all cut from the first movie. Which in hindsight is probably what happened. Maybe there will a Rebel Moon: Zach Snyder edition that is the original cut of the movie that makes more sense than this patchwork of science fiction trash we got so far.\n\nWould I watch it again, no. Would I recommend it to a friend, no. Am I glad I watched it, no. But...I would recommend this movie for a long flight or car ride.\n\nI may come off too harsh, but I know Synder can make great films, Army of the Dead was superb, I just wonder how handicapped he is being by the producers, these two movies could have been one, and it would have a much better flow and feel. I am honestly disappointed in the quality of pictures being made now a days. With the few exceptions such as CODA, and The Batman, we haven't had very good movies in the last 3 years.\n\nAs viewers we come to movies for an escape, long format is okay, Endgame, Dune, maybe it's time the 2 hour movie format goes away and directors make the movies they want to make.\n\nThank you for your time in reading this."

        "review_detailed_main": "Zack Snyder and Netflix weren't kidding. There really is a world of difference between the Rebel Moon director's cuts and the \"neutered\" variants released back in December and April, respectively. We aren't just getting more blood, sex, and cybernetic boobies; entire characters and vital bits of context had been removed and are now restored, such as the titanic humanoid in Part Two that looks like something we might've seen if Jodorowsky's adaptation of Dune actually got made. (Release the Giger cut!!)\n\nI kept seeing accusations that Snyder and Netflix were trying to manufacture a second #ReleaseTheSnyderCut campaign and so \"market\" the movies that way -- which would have been weird because the release of the \"proper\" cuts was never in doubt (nor does Snyder's explanation, that Netflix stipulated that he could only release the R-rated cuts if he released PG-13 versions first, make a ton of sense for a company that usually doesn't hold artists back in this way). Is that what was attempted? Did Netflix genuinely not have faith in the lengthier, hyperviolent cuts? Did Snyder just want to give his fans more movies to watch (as seemed to be his tune when Part One dropped, as in the JoBlo interview where he speaks as if Netflix was always going to let him fire away multiple cuts; not that he HAD to make a PG-13 one first)? I'll leave that for the Twitter fanboys to fight over.\n\nIt's inevitable to concede that these \"director's cuts\" are an improvement upon the original releases (some haters argue that the new versions are worse because they exhibit more of Snyder's edgelord annoyances, but I would have to disagree).\n\nThe action scenes go harder (on account of several -- violent -- key shots being restored) and the slo-mo shots tend to have a bit more going on (read: blood and guts), especially in this second part. However, little can be done to salvage such an un-engaging story with such underdeveloped characters -- try as Snyder might to characterize them in ways that, this time, go beyond info dumps where they explain their characterization to us.\n\nThe world we see, on top of its visual dinginess, is still senselessly anachronistic and random, but as I said in my review of Part One, I almost find it kind of charming. It really is like watching a bunch of unrelated sci-fi and military toys strewn across the floor, then picked up by Sid from Toy Story to do with as he pleases."

Worst of all some of it is just plain dull- the 1st 15/20 minutes of part 2 is pathetic.\n\nSnyders's not made a decent movie since his debut Dawn of the Dead, which was a remake, when is this guy gonna give up?"

Even with all its supposed flaws, I was intrigued. So now I have to say, this is the worst fricken movie I have ever watched in my entire life. Given the world building the first movie sets up, I expected big plot points to be introduced in this one, maybe Kora meets her dad, maybe we get more development on the revolution, literally anything. The entire movie, TWO HOURS OF LIFE I WILL NEVER GET BACK is the group fighting against the general that should've died last movie. Frankly, his death back then was more satisfying instead of in this movie when he dies I just feel \"thank god it's over\". You can tell this movie was trying to pad out the run time too, the first half or so is just the village preparing for the battle and the preparation montage is in slow-mo every single chance it gets. No characters get any development in this movie, characters die and there is no pay off. There are no plot twists that incite any emotion except maybe in the first 5-10 minutes. I was planning on watching the third, but after this movie left me feeling genuinely upset about what I just spent my time on I don't think my curiosity can even motivate me to watch a 3rd. It's not even worth hate watching, this movie is plain boring with bad creative choices.\n\nTLDR: IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO ENJOY THE REBEL MOON SERIES, READ A SUMMARY OF THIS MOVIE AND SKIP STRAIGHT TO PART 3 (which I assume will be less horrendous when it comes out. I have hope) I'm begging you, I'm being serious. I've never wrote a movie review in my entire life and this will be my first and possibly last on IMDB. I have never had a singular movie be the reason to make me drop a series indefinitely. This is the first."

This second helping is packed with action, great fights, lots of booms and bangs, great character development and story. You really feel for these rag tag bunch of rebels as they attempt to take back their lost kingdom from the bad guys. Finished up the first episode nicely and set us up for what's coming next. Really enjoy the intricate plot and story as it builds. A few good twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. Sofia Boutella is an excellent actress and plays the main very well. She brings a lot of feeling and emotions into the story and we learn of how she became who she is as well as all the others in her close circle of warriors. If you want a good clean action sci-fi this is it. Can't wait for the next installment! No questionable content, nudity or a lot of foul language, no real gory parts but they are inferred. So safe for the kiddies. Enjoy."

I fast forwarded through some unnecessary portions.\n\nThis film had a simple plot: defense of a planet required for Logisitics / food for the \"bad guy\" armies. Still confused how a small village cultivates enough food to become a strategic location - wasting so much manpower and equipment in a universe so large where surely there is tech to produce food? Can bring a human back to life but can't mass produce food in a lab? I get it's science fiction but come on, have some reason or explanation.\n\nAnyways, the battle scenes are entertaining, setting aside some wild notions of combat. Too much slow motion - to include farming....guess it was meant to show the band of heroes bonding with the townspeople? Never seen slow motion farming in an action movie before, definite first.\n\nMaybe third time will be a charm?"

I never understood why studios did not let him have full control over his movies. Watchman directors cut and Snyder Cut of Justice League are 2 of my favorite movies. I was always rooting for him to direct a SW movie. Now I understand why studios does not let directors have full control over movies. I can't believe they almost spend $200 million for this movie. First one and this one are one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Zero creativity , horrible writing , unwatchable plot , acting is subpar and directing is unbearable ! Overuse of slowmo scenes for no reason is so cringe. I got second hand embarrassment from watching some of the scenes that tried to be emotional but felt extremely forced and poor. And shame on Netflix for green lighting this project and spending 300-400 million dollar for both movies but keep canceling fantastic shows because they don't have enough viewers or they cost too much !!! Please DO NOT make any of these movies and waste our subscription money for them. Just plain horrible."

Its length, two hours for each episode, feels due to lack of imagination, dialogue, and excess heavenly choruses instead nearly double, meaning for hours.

The villagers' grueling labor and desperation for example is a returning (copy pasta?) element that critics use, yet the slow-motion in these scenes is clearly for adding emotional weight to the story-line. (given you actually watched the movie)\n\nCritics have taken these, and much much more, aspects completely out of context to undermine the film and influence their readers before even watching it.\n\nI am therefor rating a 10/10 in contrast with all this unfounded and biased negativity imo."

The script was probably shredded first and then glued together because it just didn't make sense. Zack Snyder brought Cheesy to another level which I didn't know it was possible, the slow motion scenes lasted for almost half of the movie I found myself skipping movie forward. The technology, apparently movie is set in the future, yet they use analogue buttons and switches and the rocket engines leave trail of smoke like a Russian Volga car from the 80s, I have even seen an empire soldier contacting his superior over an analogue phone with a cable.

        "review_title": "REBEL MOON PART 2 THE SCARGIVER movie review",
        "review_detailed_main": "This part of the film improves on the earlier one. It is much more center-focused, with the battle of the village of Veldt, the planet from which our Rebels are willing to defend this town.\n\nThe film is filled with beautiful cinematography, especially in the most underrated and over-hated scene of the wheat being harvested. While mundane, this scene symbolizes the Rebels' commitment to their cause and connection to the land they are fighting for. Knowing they grew wheat and farmed it is impressive (in Real life), a testament to their resilience and determination.\n\nThe action set pieces of this part of the film are also impressive because there are many action scenes in this film, and now knowing these characters' backstories, some of which are explained in this film, made me understand their struggles and the sadness they have endured. The fighting choreography also has a ton of weight to it, especially when Atitus Noble (Ed Skrein) goes on a terminator killing spree and his fight later in the film with Kora (Sofia Boutella), which is a blast to see the flips and turns which reminded me a lot of Transformers the Last Knight of the ship tumbling in zero gravity.\n\nAnother subject I wanted to discuss was the fictionalized weapons I was unaware of, such as the shot Lava rounds. Laser swords also have a tremendous amount of density in their usage. Yes, the lightsaber swords in this film hit the homage to Star Wars Lightsabers. Still, they have one distinct difference, and the only way to use them is either metallic arms or heat-resistant clothing, which gives the weapons a bit of a dangerous usage for the user.\n\nThe characters they have improved on are General Titus, Milius, and Nemesis, as well as Tarak's background, which aids their reasoning of fighting due to the MOTHERWORLD'S corruption & greed that has caused so much pain to them. For example, General Titus disobeying an order from The MOTHERWORLD caused his entire crew's demise. You have Milius, who was one of these very people, a farmer but was enslaved by the MOTHERWORLD, and Nemesis, the death of her child that made her go on a revenge spree; as for Tarak, not only did he lose his father, his mother, and his world he too in many ways suffers from the aftermath of that event. These backstories add depth to the characters and make their actions more understandable.\n\nOne of the things I commend in both films is how the MOTHERWORLD is portrayed. It's not an Evil world, but it is a planet that at one time in its political career, and the King of the MOTHERWORLD isn't a 100% evil ruler; however, a ruler that sought war to expand their domain as a ruler would do in colonialism, but due to having a daughter. The Princess Issa (Stella Grace Fitzgerald) changed his perspective in which both parts briefly describe her divine power of what I can presume Rebel Moon's Depiction of the Force, which I am hoping the Directors cut explains more of because the world-building of both The MOTHERWORLD and Veldt as well the magical force implications of the Princess Issa and what she will affect the coming sequels.\n\nOne of the topics I did not discuss in both cuts of the film was Balisarius (Rupert Friend), who took over the monarchy by executing the king and queen in a coup d'\u00e9tat and forcing Kora to eliminate the princess. The actor who plays him is good. Unfortunately, in this film cut, he doesn't appear a lot, which impacts the film significantly because we don't see much of him. It does feel like it will lead up to the next movie.\n\nOne of my props for the film is its Music. The music in both parts was excellent and evoked much emotion while watching them. The score effectively enhances the emotional impact of key scenes, from the intense action sequences to the poignant character moments. It excites me to hear more of it in the director's cut.\n\nThat is, sadly, my complaint about this cut of the film. Many scenes feel intentionally set up for the next movie without fully explaining why said Princess is Alive or how the events will affect future releases. Not only that, but several scenes feel like they were cut between scenes, which I will await to see in the director's cut. I am eagerly expecting the director's cut, as I presume it will delve deeper into the characters' backstories and Lore, especially with the statue of the robot lady that appears in the trailer of the director's cut that had voice lines.\n\nWhile the film has fewer issues than the prior art, it does suffer at the cost of more action scenes and story, especially with the Rebellion shown in the earlier film and how they arrived at the battlefield. My minor issue is that killing off my favorite characters makes it emotionally damaging because you connect with them as characters.\n\nThis film is not the worst thing I have seen, but I can see its potential for this universe to succeed. I am hopeful for the future of this universe, and I eagerly await tomorrow's director's cut. In conclusion, I will give the standard Cut of REBEL MOON Part 2 THE SCARGIVER an 8/10."

Yes he can direct a camera but everything else is below what I would expect from a film student.\n\nYou have solid actors with zero to work with, a script that a 5 year old likely came up with the plot outline, dialogue so bad I couldn't even laugh, and his visual \"style\" they only thing he has got going on full display.\n\nI have no idea how he gets job, his movies are all rated average with a couple of exceptions.

I went to bathroom due to boredom i came back they were still aiming....i went in the kitchen to pour a glass of scotch to calm my mind....guess what ...still aiming.\n\nBeside these epic moments the movie is like this: half movie peasants gather around, shout something then un-gather or some people (more of them or just a single person) go outside and look very concerned at the sky a quarter of the movie some people keep motivational speeches so boring that even my dog started to howl ,which it never does... and the last quarter of the movie the leading actress moans with different intensities like in some bad simulated sex scenes.\n\nAs you see i didnt mention the fact stated by others that the so-called movie is a lame copy made of small pieces glued together from other creations.

        "review_title": "Zack Snyder Is the King of sci-fi films",
        "review_detailed_main": "Rebel Moon creator Zach Snyder praised Part One: A Child of Fire as an exciting new dawn for the sci-fi genre, featuring a two-part story involving a bustling galaxy ruled by a militaristic regime. However, after two hours and 15 minutes, Part One proved unsatisfactory and half-baked action movie cobbled together from parts of more inspired genre fare. Rebel Moon Part Two: The Scargiver offers only a slight improvement, thanks to its simpler story and more enticing climactic battle, but two more hours of the same shallow characters and plot. The plot of The Scargiver plays out like Seven Samurai/The Magnificent Seven meets Return of the Jedi, with the warrior crew returning to the moon of Veldt to protect the villagers from the Imperium army. With a ticking clock counting down until an Imperium dreadnought arrives, Snyder spends a gratuitous amount of time showing the villagers and warriors harvesting the land. The voiceover of Anthony Hopkins' mechanical knight, James, is confounding and provides little value to the story, except for a late tag-team entry into the fray. \"Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver\" is the second installment in Zack Snyder's sci-fi series, featuring a group of space-Amish farmers who face off against cartoon baddies with jackboots and glowing swords. The film's trademarks, such as extravagant lens flares and slow-motion shots, are used with abandon, and while Sofia Boutella delivers a balletic elegance in her fight sequences, it ultimately lacks a uniqueness. The film draws from various influences, including Star Wars, Mad Max, Caravaggio, John Ford, European art-house cinema, World War II propaganda flicks, steampunk Victoriana, cottagecore girlies on Instagram, and Wagner's \"G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung.\" The score features two types of choirs and a single frame might include a robot dressed like the Green Knight and a Conan the Barbarian clone. Despite its generic content, \"The Scargiver\" is a delirious, pulpy mishmash of knockoffs. The first \"Rebel Moon\" was released on Netflix in December and featured a farm boy named Gunnar and a secretive assassin named Kora. The story picks up five days before the squad must defeat a vicious army led by an admiral (Ed Skrein) with a bad haircut and worse attitude. The script by Snyder, Kurt Johnstad, and Shay Hatten is a mix of exposition and soliloquies, with no authentic conversations. The film features primal, pitiless, and agonizing carnage, with Snyder excelling in his ability to kill anyone, even nice people and grandmothers-turned-guerrilla warriors. The film has plenty of death, but little life, with Boutella, the lead, being listless until she can stabbing. Slow motion footage is used in scenes where actors seem to be ordered to ignore food. Snyder's ostentatiousness is unmatched, with his refusal to dial down any of his impulses, such as dramatic smooches and priestly hats. The film's moral debate is reminiscent of Kevin Smith's \"Clerks,\" where the moral debate revolves around the never-seen workers who died building the Death Star for Darth Vader. Snyder shows their faces and mows them down, making it a more realistic portrayal of the battle."

Almost not a single scene where I haven't seen something similar, almost not a piece of dialogue I haven't heard before. The story is sloppy, the characters underdeveloped with a weak attempt to make you understand them better (that table scene... ouch, painful). The cast is not given much to work with, some of the more veteran actors get away with it, but it's painfully obvious who doesn't.\n\nOnly watch it for the sweet visuals, the rest is a big waste of time."

Fine.\n\nBut now add all those cliches: light sabers, AI droids, human-cyborg villain, farmers fighting trained soldiers, all the \"honor\" speeches, etc., and you get 2 hours of unbelievable bad taste. If that is not bad enough, the overuse of slow-motion scenes is nauseating. Why do a slow-mo of folks harvesting????\n\nWith the exception of the main villain, the acting is ok, but nothing can save this script."

Majority of the movies are such that the actors are playing themselves rather than playing the characters.\n\nRebel moon also has many familiar faces, but they have solid script, characters have great chemistry, they show emotional maturity which died in the 90's or early 2000's I guess. These movies have wonderful CG scenes. The story is gripping, yes the progression is slow but not boring. The story is in parts so there will be some parts in the movie that is more talkative just build that momentum in the story and depth in the characters.\n\nI guess the audience have become too picky or they have lost interest in connecting with a good story. If these movies would have released in early 2000's, people would have gone crazy. I'm not saying that the movies look old, it's just that people don't like different things anymore."

Instead of building depth, they make the experience tiresome and monotonous.\n\nThe main villain is a disappointing stereotype, lacking originality and depth.

There are solid foundations for an interesting lore lying underneath the ridiculous shenanigans, you can see potential for a better story even if the movie doesn't live up to the expectations. Those are the only positives in Rebel Moon Part 2.\n\nThe main problem is Snyder spends a minimal amount of time on character development and as a result you don't care about whether or not the rebels will live to fight another day, making the battle feel insignificant in the process and actors acting like emotionless robots for 70% of the time certainly doesn't help the situation.\n\nIn the midst of the visual chaos there's something weirdly amusing about watching a director try his best to make something interesting, but failling every single time. There are many death scenes, dramatic moments, inspirational speeches, constant screaming and ridiculously ellaborate action sequences with excessive amounts of slow motion. These moments aren't supposed to be funny, but I couldn't stop laughing at the imcompetente storytelling. If you plan on watching this, make sure to stick around for the funniest cliffhanger in movie history.\n\nIf you're looking for a guilty pleasure to entertain you for two hours, you won't be dissapointed. It's entertaining for all the wrong reasons tho. Once the numbers for this sequel show a gradual decline in viewership and popularity compared to the original, The streaming giant will think twice before giving Zack Snyder full creative control over anything. A franchise with 6 movies? I doubt it."

The film's core narrative-outsiders uniting to protect the vulnerable-echoes the themes of camaraderie, sacrifice, and justice that made \"The Magnificent Seven\" a classic.\n\nThe ensemble cast delivers outstanding performances, each character bringing unique strengths and captivating backstories to the forefront. Their dynamic interactions and shared mission create an emotional resonance that elevates the film beyond mere spectacle. Fans of \"The Magnificent Seven\" will appreciate the homage paid to the original, while enjoying the fresh and imaginative setting of a distant galaxy.\n\n\"Rebel Moon\" also excels in its world-building, with stunning visual effects and intricate set designs that immerse viewers in a richly detailed cosmos. Snyder's direction ensures that the action sequences are both thrilling and beautifully choreographed, making every battle scene a visual feast.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Rebel Moon\" is a triumphant addition to Netflix's catalog, offering a perfect blend of nostalgia and innovation. It stands as a worthy successor to \"The Magnificent Seven,\" reimagined for a new generation in a faraway universe. Whether you're a sci-fi enthusiast or a fan of classic Westerns, \"Rebel Moon\" is a cinematic experience that shouldn't be missed."

I got to give it to Zack Snyder he is pretty consistent with these type of films, just not in the good kind of consistency. There are scenes in this film that seem to be ripped off straight from Star Wars. Also the multiple slow motion action shots get really tiresome after a while. This movie might have been a little bit more enjoyable if it was edited together better. Now before you start to think I'm a Zack Snyder hater I am not! I have enjoyed some of his previous work like The Watchmen or Dawn of the Dead. I feel like Netflix went all in with this movie franchise from Mr. Snyder and are now probably quickly regretting it. Rebel Moon Part Two is a sequel we did not need but got anyways. Rebel Moon Part Two gets a very low 2 stars out of 10."

I absolutely loved the slow motions, they allowed viewers to easily notice how bad the fighing coreography was.\n\nAnd the music, so good, full of emotion, I loved it! I was perfectly chosen in contrast with the poorly written dialogue and predictable plot.\n\nIn the end, the one that did it for me was Leonidas's spartan participating to the action. The abs, the cape, the axe... it was all there.

Forget about a larger sense of consistency across the film. I wish I could say that Snyder at least seems to understand how to create cool action. I think at one point in time he probably did - earlier films of his like Dawn of the Dead and 300 seem to suggest he had some clue about this. I don't know what happened, because even the main battle here was frightfully dull and full of nonsense like people rushing at each other with guns so that they could... hit each other with the guns. People look on as their friends get killed about 20 feet away, at which point they rush over to help them after it's too late. Protagonists have clear opportunities to kill their enemies but simply decide not to for no reason. We discover that the ships are powered by... coal. Yes, there are rooms on the ship where people are shoveling coal into the engines. But they also have scanning technology that rivals Star Trek.\n\nThese movies should have written themselves. It's a shame, because I really like Sofia Boutella but she deserves a much better franchise than this."

I know Star Wars Stormtroopers are hero blind, but this film takes it to a whole new level. In general I thought the cinematography was fine, although all the slow motion achieved was highlighting 'victims' being hit before the strike lands - honestly. The whole film has that pseudo amateur feel of a TV show. I think some ideas are well suited to a cartoon, and no, I don't mean animated film...I mean cartoon."

Serious psychedelic drug abuse can be the only explanation for these horrible details. The rest of the story is filled with characters you can't identify with or like, plot lines that make no sense and just agh, it goes on and on, one flaw after another. I hope Netflix does the right thing here and asks Mr. Snyder to empty his desk and follow the nice man in uniform out of the building.

Certain influential people that seem to have been tasked with spitting on everything Snyder does have set the tone, and the entourage is following. They don't want to seem uncool.\n\nIt's a good matinee movie, the way they were made once upon a time.\n\nThe first part was disappointing, too messy, but this second part makes up for it. Apart from some pacing problems, it's good. The fight scenes are amazing.\n\nThere were several films that failed at the cinemas, Waterworld, John Carter, but became cult classics. This one is a future classic.\n\nAnd I'd rather see an evolution of the Snyderverse than the commercial garbage that Star Wars has evolved into.\n\nGo, Zack, go."

Snyder has proven beyond a doubt he is gunning for Ed Woods crown for worst film maker.\n\nEven with huge budgets and decent actors... this director has created some turds in his time and Rebel Moon ranks up there with Sucker Punch.\n\nThe plot and writing and some of the performances in rebel moon feel like the start of a 70s porno... and that's something to behold.\n\nThe reason he continues to have a career is because of his rabid snyderverse fans who have never left their basements and support his mediocre skills.\n\nThis double feature is showcasing just how bad Snyder is in not just writing but directing.\n\nAll I can say in the positive note is thankgod Snyder has been relegated to streaming for the rest of his life.\n\nIt took me over 14 attempts to complete watching rebel moon parts one and two And I will definitely not try to watch his directors cut later as I believe I would suffer permanent brain rot and end up like his snyderverse fans."

I gave it 2 stars because the CGI and special effects were quite good. But the story... oh my.... where to start.... it just doesn't make any sense at all. The worst are the stupid dialogues, they just don't make any sense. And the backstories on the magnificent 7 were just laughable.\n\nWith such a budget it could have been so much better. Well at least we now know where Chappie went after his movie. He grew older and got the voice of Anthony Hopkins. Give us an army of 1000 chappies next movie, it'll be finished in 5 minutes. Seriously, James/Jimmy/Chappie was the only interesting character in the whole movie. Long live AI...."

The fact of the matter is, when I watched this, I wasn't looking for a heady sci di space opera. I was looking for a fun movie, and I got that. I admit the slo mo could be tedious, and the characters have minimal character work, but it's a fun time. Turn your brain off and enjoy the show. I think it is well worth it, and I would be more than happy to watch another few films in this universe if they keep building on what worked and keep improving.

Look at her fight scenes, her facial expressions, and her delivery... It's awful... And the plot is beyond nonsense, even when disbelief has been turned to zero, it's still a degree of nonsense somewhere bellow sh*t... A better use of this film has been by the voluminous YouTube channels who have created reviews articulating precisely how truly awful the film actually is... Boutella ruined Star Trek, The Mummy franchise, and now the Snider-verse..."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's like they were contractually obligated to fill in a 2 hour runtime but only had a 60 page script. Almost every scene was twice as long as it needed to be so the movie was just a slog to get through. So many scenes had slow motion every 10 seconds that made them even longer (seriously: 4 mins of watching people harvest grain wasn't bad enough so they added slow mo to make it even longer?)\n\nThe deaths were unearned and seemed to be just tossed in randomly to try to drum up some drama. Even an overly-long scene explaining everyone's backstory (with - you guessed it - slow mo!) wasn't enough to make me care if they died. They were predictable deaths, too - choreographed way ahead of time just based on where the character was or what was going on around them.\n\nHonestly can't say a single good thing about this. It was about an hour long than it needed to be (as was the first.) God I hope they don't release a director's cut because I can't imagine what kind of filler they are going to add in for another 30-40 mins. Just kidding - it's going to be extra slow-mo scenes!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I would say its a solid 7/10. Nicely relates to part one. Its not Snyder's best work. But its not so bad as some of the other reviewers are making it.\n\nI didn't have much expectation from a Netflix production. But its way better than an average Netflix movie. The movie could have been way better with a big studio and production house behind it. The story is solid but again could have been much better. I heard WB turned it down. I feel it could have been a great movie series with more investments, writers, producers, dialogues, a little more touching portrayal (the story is there but lacks representation). Maybe will get to see more in the extended cut.\n\nOverall, the movie is very good in my opinion. Watching the two movies together back-to-back is better. Don't suggest listening to those giving 1 or 2 rating. They just have some personal vendetta against Snyder. Without any bias, its a solid watch without any nonsense or stupid jokes."

The new movies might be bad but compared to whatever this is they deserve an Oscar.\n\nThe story, characters and universe makes no sense at all. The dialogues are extraordinarily cringe and often unnecessary.\n\nPlease read some other reviews but I urge you to not waste your time on this movie. You'll regret watching this.\n\nIf you are into Sci-fi check out John Carter, the movie flopped but it's actually entertaining."

Could see where it was heading, in it's hushed way. Part 2 is the oppose, in a bad way.\n\nWhile part 1 hurried along, trying to created several hooks, deal with several issues and unite a lot of people, without stopping in any point to explore the possibilities, part 2 drags... and drags... and drags.... Long scenes of people harvesting grains is just an example, and far from the worse of it.\n\nSure, this is not as bad as, say, Moonfall or Battlefield Earth. And that is the thing I can say about it."
