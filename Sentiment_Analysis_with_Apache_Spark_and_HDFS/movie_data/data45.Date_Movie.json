I'm not sure how a movie so god-awful can make it to screen, but my faith in the system has been shaken. The film isn't funny, I'm not sure if it tries to be or not, but it's not. It references other movies (Meet the Parents, When Harry met Sally etc.) but doesn't really spoof them. This was the biggest problem I believe, as it doesn't have any semblance of flow or sense. Random scenes pop up, trying to get a laugh by basically reenacting the scene, not exaggerating it or making fun of it. I managed to sit through House of the Dead, but this film actually made me angry it was so unfunny. Please skip it, have one of your friends go see it instead and then ask about it. If they don't knock your teeth out for setting them up to lose money and 90 minutes of their life, then you can go see it yourself."

I mean very high. I am a sucker for the parody genre. Ever since The Naked Gun films and Airplane!, Wrongfully Accused, Spy Hard, Scary Movie.. I've been a nut for these types of movies. So why was this one so bad? I can't really explain.. I saw all the movies they parodied, and still.. it just wasn't funny. I am absolutely in love with Alyson Hannigan. She's a very beautifal and very talented actress. Eddie Griffin is one of the funniest comedians to grace the silver screen in years. And please, Lil' Jon is in the movie! What's not to like? Well, the fact that basically, a lot of the parodies were just word for word retellings of some of the movies. The dinner scene was an ENTIRE ripoff of the Meet the Parents scene to a t. This movie tries too hard to be funny, and at sometimes its okay (the Pimp My Ride scene comes to mind), but honestly.. it just tries too hard and doesn't go anywhere. I can't say I was disappointed, it was beyond that. If there's a sequel to this atrocious comedy I'll eat my hat."

Well, she's in it, and she makes the most of a thoroughly unchallenging role, but unless you're a total completist, that shouldn't be enough of a reason to waste even 80 minutes of your life on this appalling waste of talent.\n\nWhat the writer/directors seem to have missed is that if you're going to parody or satirise a scene from a decent movie, you actually have to add something. It's not sufficient to just throw a bunch of stolen scenes together in the hope that the conjunction will generate humour by itself. I honestly could not see one - not ONE - original thought or idea or line in the script or direction. That in itself is something of an achievement. The whole thing plays like it was scripted by teenagers, and not teenagers from the top end of the grade curve.\n\nIn fact, I have to wonder if this films is deliberately aimed at the lowest common denominator. If so, it missed by several yards to the south."

        "review_title": "Just when you thought Hollywood has reached an all time low, you get \"Date Movie.\"",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Date Movie\" is a movie that spoofs romantic comedies. The movie follows Julia Jones (Alyson Hannigan) as she goes through all the events that take place in order to marry her prince Grant (Adam Campbell). This process involves meeting the parents, breaking up, meeting the ex-girlfriend, planning the wedding and everything else that the romantic comedy genre has thrown our way. Laughs are supposed to ensue\u0085\n\nJust when you thought Hollywood has reached an all time low comes \"Date Movie,\" a movie that proves that anything can be made into a film in Hollywood and no matter how bad something is people will dish out their hard earned money to see it. \"Date Movie\" is by far the worst pile of crap I have seen in several years and can possibly go down in the history of film as being one of the worst movies ever made.\n\nThis movie contained zero laughs, none of the spoofs were even remotely funny. It was an insult to anyone who dished out any kind of money to see this film. The saddest part about all of this is that I knew before seeing this movie that it was going to be bad but I didn't think it could ever be as bad as it actually was. All the jokes fell flat and half way through its groundbreaking 75 minute running time I wanted to find a way to end my life so I wouldn't have to sit through another second of this horrid movie.\n\nThere really isn't a positive thing I can say about this movie. The first question that comes to mind though is who the hell came up with the idea. Why spoof comedies? Comedies are already funny so why spoof them? This is a question I wondered when I first heard about the movie and now after seeing \"Date Movie\" I know it can't be done and shouldn't even be attempted. While \"Date Movie\" only runs 75 minutes they try to spoof everything they can including Bridget Jones's Diary, Kill Bill, Say Anything, My Best Friend's Wedding, Napoleon Dynamite, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Hitch, The Bachelor, Meet the Parents, Sleepless in Seattle, Rize, King Kong, Wedding Planner and so many more. You would think that one joke would work but in all honesty not a single one did. You just sit there staring at the screen, losing your brain cells, and wondering how on earth someone got money to produce this pile of garbage.\n\nI guess you should know that a movie is really bad when it's not screened for critics and the trailer tries to sell you a movie by saying \"from 2 of the 6 writers of Scary Movie\" but there is always that small part of me that says it can't be as bad as it looks but in this case it's worse than it looks. It's a train wreck and if anyone finds this movie funny I am sorry but there must be something seriously wrong with you or you are just so incredibly immature.\n\nThis movie took 2 people to write and two people to direct. If I ever meet Jason Friedberg or Aaron Seltzer the writers and directors behind this crap I will demand that they give me my $6.75 back for paying to see this movie. These guys have no right what so ever to make a movie when they put out a movie like \"Date Movie.\" There should be a law in Hollywood that if your movie is hated by both critics and audiences alike that you should be placed in a cell and beaten until you write everyone who watched your film a huge letter of apology. I really wonder what crap can come out of Hollywood next that can be worse than this film.\n\nSo to sum it up, \"Date Movie\" sucks, plain and simple. Even if you see it with little or no expectations you will be disappointed. I despise everyone who was involved with this movie from the entire cast who somehow read this script and said this is going to be good to the interns who didn't walk off the set after the first day of shooting. Why is it that we have to suffer through movies that are this bad? And Hollywood wonders why ticket sales are going down because when you pay $6-$10 to see a movie like \"Date Movie\" I can totally understand why people aren't going and would be leery of what Hollywood puts out. This is the worst film to come out of Hollywood in years even worse than \"Gigli,\" \"Batman and Robin\" and \"You Got Served.\"\n\nMovieManMenzel's final rating for \"Date Movie\" is a 0 out of ten. This movie doesn't even deserve a 1 because nothing worked at all and people shouldn't have to be tortured like this when they see a movie."

The story is about Julia Jones a lonely girl who just wants the perfect romance but her father wants hr to marry a Chinese-German Jew or something like that. She then meets the love of her life and all is well until his ex fianc\u00e9e comes into the picture. I recommend this film over Epic Movie and Meet The Spartans for it is funny and direct but they still can not get away from thinking that dancing from famous characters is really funny.

I admit, I laughed during the Napoleon Dynamite skit, but that was probably the only funny scene in the whole film.\n\nThis film is stupid, but not stupid in a funny way. It is stupid in an EXTREMELY boring way. The only (barely) entertaining parts of the movie were in the first 10 minutes. The rest of it was filler as the scriptwriter probably ran out of dumb ideas.\n\nI, along with probably most of the audience, felt like leaving on the spot.

It was full of disgusting jokes, and not just in a sexual way. I was surprised anyone even bothered making this movie. About 45 minutes in, I was disgusted and bored. My friends were, too. I'm not the type to walk out during a movie. I never have before, but this movie was a waste of my time, the 11 bucks I spent on the ticket, and the five bucks I spent on popcorn/ candy.

What might actually seem like a good couple of laughs, at least judging from the trailers, actually falls apart fairly quickly.

        "review_detailed_main": "People really need to realize that in order for a parody to be good, it has to be cheesy and in other words, bad. I know it's a paradox, but that is the only genre it is actually applied to. I was surprised to see the average rating of all newer parody stuff on IMDb: Date Movie, Meet the Spartans, Epic Movie, Vampires Suck, etc. They all have 2.something average rating and it's mostly because people are not well informed on the whole concept of this genre.\n\nFor a parody to be successful, it has to take elements from real life and/or movies/other media that are seemingly serious, but cheesy, little overrated, over the top, inaccurate, ignorant, full of prejudice... etc. So, the good mocking of this just HAS to go a bit further to make the vague inaccuracies more obvious and laughable. I think that this movie succeeded in that. Everything that is bad or over the top is INTENDED to be so, hence, planned and I like it.\n\nAlyson Hannigan and Adam Campbell have good chemistry and acting skills and I enjoyed their performances very much. Adam is an underrated actor and he needs more recognition overall. Also, the cast is full of talented parody performers, like Jennifer Coolidge, Eddie Griffin and Tony Cox.\n\nFor anyone who doesn't particularly find romantic comedies good, and considers them cheesy and overrated, this is the film. It's particular 'victims' are precisely romantic comedies, mostly My Best Friend's Wedding, Meet the Fockers, Wedding Planner, Hitch, Bridget Jones' Diary, My Big Fat Greek Wedding and most wedding films.\n\nAlyson Hanigan's character is named Julia Jones, parody of Bridget Jones and Julia Roberts, and Adam Campbell plays Grant Fockyourdaughter, parody of Hugh Grant and Fockers. Sophie Monk's character is parody of Julia Roberts in My Best Friend's Wedding and typical 'bitch' characters, Tony Cox is Hitch, Julia's family is mostly parody of My Big Fat Greek Wedding family with all national prejudice in it. All the characters are hilarious and deliver their puns on time. I was laughing all the time, it's so on spot about all romantic clich\u00e9s. The moment at the end, with all the most cheesy love declarations ever is my favorite, I can't restrain from laughing hard at that point.\n\nAlso the films contains Jinxters, the most disgusting cat you just have to LOVE! Let's just mention he doesn't restrain from gerentophilia and necrophilia. His scenes are so disgustingly nauseous, but one of the funniest ever! I will probably never get tired of watching this and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves good laughter and mocking romantic clich\u00e9s.\n\nIt's 9/10 in everything it was supposed to be no matter what critic say!"

But despite the fact I wanted to hate it, and despite the fact it really was awful, I still feel fairly entertained. And best of all, the film was really short (roughly 73 minutes).\n\nThe bad: The is film is nothing more than 50 other movies (mostly romances or chick flicks) strung together in a very exaggerated way. So if you are looking for something unique, this is the last place you want to check. The acting is also rather poor, and the soundtrack seems to be just Kelis and the Pussycat Dolls repeated over and over. I would not take a date to see this \"date movie\" unless she was 12, but then I'd have bigger problems than this movie.\n\nThe good: I sadly must admit I enjoyed the cat using the toilet. At first it was stupid, but they stretched the scene way beyond the time necessary. Sometimes when you repeat a bad joke long enough it becomes great. For me, this was that moment. Also, this film featured two of my three favorite Buffy actors. Alyson Hannigan was beautiful and fun, and less obscene than in the \"American Pie\" movies. And Tom Lenk shows up in a cameo appearance as Frodo Baggins, a scene that makes no sense with the rest of the movie but I found to be juxtapositionally hilarious. If only this film also had Michelle Trachtenberg.\n\nThe ugly: The disgusting parts were actually much less than in the Scary Movie series. Other than pimple joke, I think the only really gross thing was the way this film portrayed fat people. A fat joke here or there I can understand, but they stretched the jokes to the limit with this movie and it was rather nauseating.\n\nDon't rent this movie. Although if you like the stupidity that passes for humor these days, this might be up your alley. Heck, I deplore this film and still confess I laughed out loud at least twice. But don't tell anyone I said that, because this movie is not good."

They could have made this into like 2 or 3 different movies and expanded. making it more original. But every scene was taken from something else. The scenes just made no sense when you watch them all as one movie, they even had movie spoofs of films that came out literally like 6 months ago. Some of the actors did not even seem to have any life to them, they were just there to be fillers. They should have taken more time to make this.To sum up this movie: sad, just a sad poorly done film."

What I got was this piece of crap that was a complete waste of an hour and a half and my 6.50. What's the problem? Oh where to begin...first of all, the plot is stupid. It's simple enough, I guess, but there's so many random things that just don't make sense (the random weird flashbacks during the Kill Bill sequence, for one). I don't know if it's just that the parody genre is being stretched so thin that there isn't anything left anymore, or if this movie was just bad writing. The acting isn't terrible, though some is cringe worthy. I think they tried so hard for going over the top that the jokes turn out disgusting, offensive, gratuitous, and just plain not funny. Nearly every sequence with \"Jinxers\", the Jones family cat, are horrid and disgusting. Nearly 98% of the jokes I had to tell my sister I would explain to her when she was older. And to complete it all, I was in a theater full of teenage boys, and not one of them laughed once, which goes to show how much the film falls on its face. The only time the audience gave a half-hearted chuckle was during the Mr. and Mrs. Smith sequence. So save yourself the time and money. Skip this absolute zero."

Sophie Monk and Carmen Electra are very sexy and give the necessary eroticism of the plot.

Why Alyson Hannigan decided to star in this movie is beyond me. Sophie Monk was the only decent actor and put on the American accent well in her first movie role (despite being cast as eye candy for the male audience). The remainder of the cast whilst possibly talented had so little to work with they would fire their agents if they ever see this trash. I saw this movie because it was free (like the rest of the cinema goers at this particular session). No one was laughing and I am sure I could hear tumbleweeds rolling through the cinema at various times. In all I counted about 4 scenes which made me laugh, I won't spoil them for you so that if you do happen to get dragged to this flick you will have some comic relief. My advice is to stay clear, well clear. Scary Movie 2 was better than this."

It started out stupid, and we hoped that it would get funnier as it went along. Well, for the next 45 minutes or so we sat through a big mix of annoying toilet humor, stupid cracks at ethnicity and fat people and sexual orientation, and, obviously, spoofs of recent romantic comedies. After all of that time, my friend looked over at me. I looked at him and knew we were thinking the same thing. He was the first to say it: \"Dude, this movie sucks.\"\n\nWell, I can tell that the makers of this movie were really trying to get something funny out of spoofing movies that WERE ALREADY FUNNY. Instead, they throw together some scenes that spoof those movies, add some nasty toilet humor and fat jokes, some sexual innuendo, some hot chicks, and some almost complete recreations of the scenes from movies they were spoofing and try to sell it off as funny. Well, sorry, filmmakers, but this isn't how you handle a movie. first of all, there is absolutely no attempt to connect these scenes by story. They just spoof a scene, move on, spoof a scene, move on, spoof a scene, move on... It is so annoyingly brain numbing (and have I mentioned not funny?) that after wards you will literally want to forget you ever saw it from the great pain it left in your head.\n\nUnless you are a fan of ridiculously dragged-out jokes, scene after scene of disgusting bodily function humor, bad acting (even from good actors like Alyson Hannigan), and comedy movies that aren't funny, don't see Date Movie. There are plenty of other more productive and entertaining things that you can do with your eighty minutes. Like staring at a wall."

The plot was simple; some of the scenes were downright gross.\n\nSo many of the characters were stereotyped, others' characters were too far exaggerated, to the point of being caricatures. It might have worked once, maybe twice, but the writers tried this on a continuous basis, and it became gross-overload.\n\nWe gave it about half-an hour, then gave up on it.

        "review_detailed_main": "When \"Airplane!\" came out in late 1980, it set the standard for the spoof movie, a motion picture that parodies a whole genre of others. In \"Airplane's\" case, it was the disaster film. It made fun of the Airport pictures, as well as \"The Posidon Adventure,\" \"Earthquake,\" and \"The High and the Mighty,\" among others.\n\nThis comedy was followed in quick succession by \"Spaceballs,\" \"Amazon Women on the Moon\" (which satirized sci-fi movies), the \"Naked Gun\" films, \"Spy Hard,\" \"Mafia\" and \"Repossessed\" (all with Leslie Nielson), \"Dracula: Dead and Loving It,\" \"Robin Hood: Men in Tights,\" \"National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon I\", and the 'Scary Movie\" series.\n\nMany of these had their own special charm, although none has lived up to the dumb-but-hilarious high mark set by Airplane! (although Nielson's \"Naked Gun\" trio, based on the short-lived 1982 TV show, \"Police Squad!,\" probably came the closest).\n\nThe newest effort, however, \"Date Movie\" (a send-up of all of those romantic stories we love to hate), attempts to do to those tales what Dick Cheney did to Harry Whittington's face, pepper it with shotgun pellets without hitting anything vital.\n\nMaking fun of such modern work as \"King Kong,\" \"When Harry Met Sally,\" \"Wedding Crashers,\" \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith,\" \"Kill Bill,\" \"Meet The Parents,\" \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin,\" \"The Wedding Planner,\" \"Bridget Jones's Diary,\" \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding,\" \"Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith,\" \"Hitch,\" \"Napoleon Dynamite,\" and a whole slew of the hip black comedies seemingly being released every week. All much better movies than this one satirizing them.\n\nAnd while the scattergun approach has worked before, the multiple targets aimed at by \"Date Movie\" remain unscathed and the audience, for the most part, remains unmoved (by laughter, anyway).\n\nI tried my best just to smirk at some of the \"jokes\" here, but I could not even force myself. I've actually been to funnier executions. This movie makes France's Reign Of Terror seem like an episode of \"Rocky & Bullwinkle.\" I've gotten bigger laughs with MY jokes, and my jokes stink.\n\nI think you get my point.\n\nThe plot (what there is of it) has one of the most untalented individuals ever to appear before a camera (including Al Gore), Adam Campbell as Grant Fonckyerdodder (get it?!), a nebbish idiot who is wooing Julia Jones (Alyson Hannigan, \"American Wedding,\" as well as a host of bad TV shows) and the supposed comic misadventures they go through meeting his folks, Jennifer and Fred (Jennifer Coolidge and Fred Willard, both veterans of the much funnier films, \"Waiting For Guffman,\" \"Best Of Show\" and \"A Mighty Wind\").\n\nGrant's beautiful ex-girlfriend, Andy (Sophie Monk), however, wants him back.\n\nOther embarrassed clowns passing themselves off as celebrities appear in this travesty, wondering around like doomed souls on the deck of the HMS Lusitania just before a German torpedo smashed into her cargo of illegal armaments. These include the poor man's Wayne Brady, Eddie Griffin (he played the pimp in the \"Deuce Bigalow\" pictures, so you get an idea of what I'm talking about), Carmen Electra, Michael Brooks, Matt Austin and Michael Jackson impersonator, Edward Moss and, oh, who cares?\n\nIt really doesn't matter one iota, anyway, you know.\n\nWith Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (\"Scary Movie\") sharing writing and directing chores (much like Loeb and Leopold shared in the killing of Bobby Franks \u0096 in fact, even Clarence Darrow wouldn't defend these directors), this will go down as nothing but a dull series of parodies that fails to parodize anything and does not even remotely approach the town of Humor.\n\nIt just stops at Tedium, spends about 90 minutes (although it seems much longer) and ends. To be fair, I guess seeing a cat on the toilet, King Kong groping Electra or Griffin as a midget pimp (is that the only character this goof-ball can play?!) might make one laugh. Probably the same people who sneak into locker rooms to sniff gym socks or those who voted for Al Sharpton, but not anyone else."

People don't have to be that serious. Anyways me I had a really good times watching this movie and I like absurd humor. I think Alison Hannigan was really funny in this role.I had prefer scary movies but I had a couple of good laugh watching this one.

This film at least has a consistent plot and there are entertaining moments.\n\nThe comedy is still very silly, juvenile and does contain its typical gross toilet humor (the cat toilet gag went on a little too long).\n\nIt isn't like Epic movie or Disaster movie (their worst film) where it completely fails at being funny and tries too hard in throwing a gag every second.\n\nAt least Alyson Hannigan is likeable. The film's runtime is quite short. Nothing too funny (as expected) but it isn't nearly as bad as critics or some of these reviews claim."

        "review_detailed_main": "In the trailers and previews for this movie, they advertise \"From 2 of the 6 writers of Scary Movie\". They clearly could have used the other 4. Date Movie is a movie where once you get thinking about the concept, you realize there's no way it can actually work, mostly because it's trying to make fun of movies that were funny in the first place. The movie ended up being more clich\u00e9d than the movies was making fun of, recycling jokes like those of Lil Jon, Pimp My Ride, and the now-tired Napoleon Dynamite impressions. The movie references fall flat every time because they're presented so blatantly. While most parody movies may take a notable line and put a twist to it or in some cases copy the line, Date Movie's approach seems to be to rip out entire scenes from movies, add some lame punchline, and expect you to laugh like they thought of it all themselves and you haven't just seen a scene from a different film for the second time.\n\nWhen I saw/sat through the movie in the theater, sitting behind me were three girls who seemed to be talking the whole time. This was the first time I absolutely didn't care that people were talking through the movie, and what I also noticed was that they kept predicting what was going to happen, which usually turned out to be true. This speaks quite a bit for the film, which was so resiliently predictable.\n\nSo overall, this film was just really awful. No one over the age of 12 should find this very funny at all, and in the rare cases where they land a joke that's actually funny or clever, they keep pushing it until they've drawn every last bit of life from it. And of course, there is the glaring lack of any originality. To say only two people wrote this movie is giving an unfair share of credit. I think the writers for Meet the Parents/Fockers, Along Came Polly, etc. are owed some royalties."

        "review_detailed_main": "I heard of this movie several weeks before it came out, and I loved the idea. The writers of scary movie taking on another type of film. I personally liked the scary movies and other films like not another teen movie (even though it was downright bad is several spots). The weekend of the release i went around and read several reviews stating how awful this movie was. Still, my friends planned on going to see it, so i joined them. I walked into the movie theater thinking that this may be a piece of utter crap. Was it? Well, yes and no. Before i go on, let me say this. If you have any decently or wit, stop reading right now. I will tell you that not only will you absolutely hate this movie, but you will despise everyone whose in it and every person in the theater who even let a soft chuckle leave their mouth. But if you found the scary movies funny, or any other crude comedies, there might be a chance you will find a laugh or two in this not-so-witty comedy. Sitting in the theater, i noticed that most kids were about my age, and I am 16. And during the movie (myself included) i was laughing, believe it or not. There are no surprises, there is no wit, and there is no standards in this film. If seeing a cat hump a dead body then pull out a pack of condoms makes you want to puke, then by all means, stay away from this film. And yes, i too found this in bad taste, which may be why i was sitting in my chair squirming and giggling at the same time. My two friends who i were with were also laughing at this movie. Many of the jokes fall flat, and some are outright disturbing to the point where you might want to leave the theater just to save the few brain cells you might have left. If you like stupid comedy (such as two people on a date beating up a homeless man for no reason) this is a film you'll want to check into. If not, then take heed to the critic's advice and don't touch this movie with a ten-foot pole. Should you run out now and chuck out 8 hard earned bucks for it? No, absolutely not. This is the movie to go see on a lazy Saturday at the dollar theater if at all. So pick away at me if you want and call me an immature teenager, but i did laugh at this movie during several places.\n\nAnd on a side note, the movie can also be looked at as some sort of a game. The parodies come by so fast, that it is sometimes fun to lean over to the person you are sitting with and try and guess which scene came from what movie. Also, these scenes that the writer's parody are usually the famous and recognizable ones. So, wait until this movie hits a cheaper theater, and watch the much better scary movie series (exculding number 2)."

Much of which is highly politically incorrect. Making fun of fat people, beating a homeless person for a laugh, toilet humor.\n\nThe super smokin' bodies of SOPHIE MONK & CARMEN ELECTRA are the only redeeming highlights. ELECTRA'S bit lasts less than 2 minutes.\n\nLooks more like a 'straight to video' or a USA network original movie than a theatrical release. Dreary, stupid & unimaginative."

I'm gonna start by saying that I wish to God there was some way to prevent films like this from STEALING our money. OK OK, they found a cute recipe when they threw out Scary Movie(the first one), but unfortunately as the films dragged on...Scary Movie 2, Scary Movie 3, Not Another Teen Movie, and the soon to be released Scary Movie 4 the jokes became repetitive, stretched, and in some cases just stupid. Date movie doesn't try any harder by stealing from already funny movies. The jokes/gags are dry and dull, the editing is horrible, and the soundtrack is...well it sucks too, what little there is! I probably shouldn't say this, because it'll confuse the types that would go to see this kind of movie, but hell I'll give credit where credit is due. I did laugh at some of the gags, but what was funny is painfully dragged out to be dry and almost embarrassing.\n\nWatch the trailer, that's all the funny you're gonna get from this movie. If you have to see it, wait and rent it, or better still, borrow it from the sucker that buys it.\n\nThis movie should have been a straight to video dud and unfortunately it doesn't deserve the screen time it's getting. Theatres should be ashamed for taking our money for films like this.\n\nREPO OUT!"

Well a typical compilation of spoofs for movies and TV shows such as Meet the parents/fockers, The wedding planner, pimp my ride, the bachelor, hitch and many more. All brought together by a ridiculous clich\u00e9 love story not to be taken seriously.\n\nTake in mind that a person with the brain of a Nat can watch this and still have a meaningful movie experience. There is a flaw in the overall flick though as it sometimes tries too hard with it's humor and drags itself into a boring scene. I recommend this for anyone with some free time and a cheap laugh. 7/10"

Now of course, my only reason for seeing the movie was that Alyson Hannigan was in it. I won't lie. But talk about wanting 1 1/2 hours of your life back. The movie barely had a plot, so it was just a bunch of unrelated, unfunny parodies, if you can call them that. I can take some crude humor, but this movie was just unnecessary. They really missed the mark in some scenes...someone should explain to them that a parody doesn't mean filming the SAME SCENE with different actors. There were a few snide remarks that made me chuckle, but everything about this movie made me remember why I don't like seeing the so-called mainstream movies. And the lead guy...not good looking. At all. If I'm going to be staring at some guy for 90 minutes, at least make it worth my while. So all in all, the jokes fall flat, and the movie really missed a chance to create something quite funny, since a parody of date movies, had it been done well, could have been hilarious. But this movie is far from that. You let me down, Alyson Hannigan. *Sigh* And another thing, it shouldn't be called Date Movie if it mocks every genre. Random Star Wars references and jokes about how advanced technology is stopped being funny...what, 5 years ago? I was hoping for something as on-the-mark as Not Another Teen Movie, but all I got was a big waste of time. Thank god it was free."

I thought that it could be a bit crass, probably heavy on fat people / scato / sex / old people jokes. It was all that ... multiplied by a factor 100.\n\nAt the very least I thought I would have a few good laughs, which I did need like many other people after a tough week. On that I was disappointed. I cracked a smile on occasion, despite my better judgment. But not once did I openly laugh. Is that too much to ask for a comedy these days ?\n\nThe premisce of Date movie is not bad in and of itself, as making fun of the self-aware and sometime pretentious \"Romantic Comedies\" shouldn't be too difficult. So where did DM go wrong ? Pretty much everywhere.\n\nFirst, it seldom relies on the foundation of any movie, also known as a script. DM pushes the spoof concept so far that it does not have -any- decent narrative structure. It's like the script writers took their favorite moments in a dozen different comedies and patched them out together in one hell of a mess that some people might call \"a movie\".\n\nAmong the scenes copied, you will find Jinxer and the toilet flush from \"Meet the parents\", Jinxer and the Urn from \"Meet the parents\", The football match from \"Meet the Fockers\" (they did their best to remind people of famous Ben Stiller movies apparently) mixed with the basket ball scene from \"Along came Poly\" (in one of the few scenes that tore out a smile out of me), The Greek restaurant scene from \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\", The Diary from \"Bridget's Jones Diary\", The Black dad from \"Something about Mary\" (they indeed are big on Stiller), The scene about \"he lost his virginity with the Maid\" from \"Meet the Fockers\" but with a gay twist, The old lady from \"Not another teen movie\" (you know they are desperate when they try to spoof a movie that was already a spoof) etc ...\n\nIn that mess, they threw a bad copy of Napoleon Dynamite \"Gosh !\", a remake of the Paris Hilton Video, A scene from King Kong, a totally out of place jab at \"The Lord of the Rings\", and various other \"winks\" at the audience that make that mess feel even less coherent if it was at all possible.\n\nIt is not only bad that they try (pitifully) to make fun of actually funny comedies (like \"Wedding Crashers\") doing it so bad it becomes un-funny, on top of that they go as far as possible in Sleazy and disgusting to keep their PG-13, to be able to (or so they thought) please their male teenage audience.\n\nAt the end, we have a sorry mumbo jumbo of scenes, that I cannot in good conscience call a movie.\n\nActors are OK, with Mrs Hannigan being really good very often. Why she accepted to participate in this mess, we will probably never know ..."

The Michael Jackson thing was stupid. They already made fun of him in SM 3. I just think the whole movie was a rush job and the plot was put together in about three hours by a few high college kids who had no idea what they were doing. American Pie was much better, but still anybody who has anything to do with this movie has committed an unforgivable sin. The only reason I saw this movie was because there was nothing else except The Pink Panther, and god knows how that would have turned out.

The film's fault is that it tries too hard to be funny and can become irritating in its frantic bid to have laughs at any cost.\n\nThat bing said, I do not think this is a bad film as such. There are worse."

TERRIBLE.\n\nI have a wide range of tastes, including for the sophomoric. I liked parts of Scary Movie, and I loved Not Another Teen movie. Date Movie is NOT like either of those. It just fails on so many levels. Where NATM plays on the sappiness and idiocy of so many teen movies in sometimes dumb but usually successful ways, Date Movie just says \"Hey, remember this scene from that movie ten years ago? Isn't it cool that we're parodying it? Do you get the reference? DO YOU GET IT?\" and continues on with it. There's not one thing I can remember I liked about this movie, and I wasn't the only one. Honestly I didn't go in expecting much - I was just with my friends, and they thought it would be really funny and I didn't feel like seeing something else by myself. When we left, none of my friends wanted to admit that they saw it, and my friends are idiots who love stupid humor.\n\nI'm not going to go over any of the specific details of the movie, a lot of other reviews have done that. But I'm just letting you, the reader, know that there is not ONE redeeming quality of this film. It is probably much worse than you're thinking right now."

If that was what was intended, DATE MOVIE fails on all counts. There isn't a single laugh to be had, and the movie feels like a bad high school play. A nebbish (Campbell) is courting a sweet young gal (Hannigan, who should know better). But his best-est friend is a fem,ale and a knockout (Monk) who also happens to be a former girlfriend. She intends to spoil their marriage plans and win him back. A slew of familiar faces play various parents, other relatives and friends. Eddie Griffin is along for the ride, and he is singularly unfunny in this. Somehow, I don't think it was his fault. Let me give you one instance of how this film fails at every turn: When Hannigan first meets her beau's best-est buddy, Monk is shown diving into a pool, coming up on the other side, showering off, then washing a car in her too-tiny bikini and even pole-dancing with the shower. This is all done in slow-mo and seems to go on on forever. Hanigan even comments on it. Through it all, we keep cutting back to Campbell and Hanigan for reacti0n shots, but they are all too obviously staring at the camera and not at Monk, who clearly filmed her sultry scenes separately. If this is supposed to be funny, it isn't. And when the three of them finally sit down together next to the pool, Monk whips off her tiny swimsuit and sits down nekked, except it just isn't funny or arousing or anything. You just want the damned sequence to end. Please pass this stinker by."

While many of the jokes are carbon copies of previous jokes in slapstick movies (not the first time, perhaps the worst time), there are a few truly hilarious, timely, even satirical and keenly observed tid bits beneath the cheap muck. I think what alienates most people from this movie is the overt nature of it's teen demographic (perhaps moreso then the scary movies), and the fact that it seemingly just stretches out it's parodies in an uninspired, exploitive manner..That may be true, but for some reason moments when they are simply mocking other comedy scenes by grossly overplaying them usually work at articulating why those original scenes were not really funny in the first place..I guess for me, having thought the majority of the scenes parodied we're originally pretty lame, was delighted to see them shat upon...Besides the parodies there are some decent performances and a few hysterical moments of morbid laughs if your dark humor cap is on tight (sometimes they cross the line, but usually they do not)...So there are some hit's among at least as many misses in this cheaply put together, but more cohesive then I was led to believe movie...If you are young (or at heart), and are in need of a frying pan to the head laugh, hopefully you will catch a few good ones with this flick."

Some of the scenes referencing other movies last maybe a .5 second. It's like they tried to cram as many movies into this thing as they could. Rather than going for quality they went for quantity, and some of the attempted spoofs are just downright stupid, and not in a funny way. None of the group that I watched it with enjoyed it. You'll find yourself watching a \"spoofed\" scene waiting for them to do something different from the original, and then when it comes to that point you'll find yourself like \"that's it? that's all they're changing about it?\".

Some of the highlights are: Jennifer Coolidge does a very accurate and funny Barbara Streisand, Tony Cox shows that he is the big man on campus when it comes to comedy, Meera Simhan is beautiful and funny, and Eddie Griffin was a trooper trying to put his best foot forward through a difficult situation. I got the feeling throughout the movie that Mr. Griffin was on auto pilot; not really acting or using his considerable talent but just coasting as if he knew the effort would be wasted.\n\nWait until the movie comes out on DVD and then get drunk before watching it because that is the only way it will ever be funny. A thorough waste of 83 minutes of my life I can never get back."

This is definitely a teen guy's movie. This movie isn't even worth renting, let alone buying.\n\nIf the same producers hadn't used the same stupid lines for their other five bazillion movies, they might be somewhat funny.

This movie is so full of tired old setups with no laughs, and usually a gross out payoff. The 'hair gel' scene in \"Something About Mary\" is Shakespeare compared to the writers in \"Date Movie\", who are probably still in middle school. When lacking any other creative idea, the writers seem to fall back to the full-screen booty shot. There are a few laughs early on, but before half the movie is over, they are long gone. The writers seem to think we haven't seen this all before, and spend way too long setting up each punch line. HELLO, it's a parody of several other movies, we don't need long setups. The jokes should come fast and heavy, but the only thing heavy in this movie is Alyson's character in the beginning. Pathetic and very disappointing, this effort should be avoided at all costs, even in the Video store."

Why did you let the makers make such an awful movie? Date Movie has to be the worst movie of 2006, and I say that without having second thoughts. The jokes were either nasty or I already heard them somewhere else. Prolonged and hackneyed jokes filled the hour and a half. I, at some point, even felt like I was being punished for a crime I didn't commit. I also felt trapped in the middle of nowhere. That's how much I hated it.

        "review_detailed_main": "There's a lot of romantic movies out there, and the mindset of \"Date Movie\" seems to jam all those movies into an hour and a half of a film lacking a solid plot or even a grain of coherence. That's not the worst thing about the movie though. With this kind of film, you really have to go down to the lowest form of intelligence you can ever be and fervently wish that the filmmakers had at least given you a justification of spending your money by an honestly funny script. It's one heck of a chore.\n\nJulia Jones (Alysson Hannigan) is an obese waiter at a Greek restaurant who meets his Prince Charming in Grant Funkyerdoder (Adam Campbell). She consults date doctor Hitch (Tony Cox), who transforms her into a proverbial swan. But before they can officially tie the knot, they have to go through a series of unfunny jokes that supposedly parody different scenes from \"Meet the Parents\" to \"My Best Friend's Wedding.\"\n\nThe characters are totally impossible to identify with although it would be unfair to pin down the blame to any of the actors, as the script just doesn't really stand out with most jokes falling flat. Not one laugh comes across as funny because the jokes are so simplistic. Besides, writers and directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (yes, \"two of the six\" writers of \"Scary Movie\") don't seem to have any grasp of the importance of timing in creating a comedy nor do they pace the film in such a way that makes it an effective parody of the genre it spoofs.\n\nIn the end, watching this film feels like you're trapped in a restaurant with some annoying loser who talks all evening thinking s/he's funny, and you wish you were at home instead, doing something - anything - else."

You wanna know why? There is absolutely no continuity in plot. The writers just wanted to shove in as many random movies as humanly possible.

I found myself just plain not getting a lot of the \"jokes\" in the film because I hadn't seen the movie that they were making fun of.

I am a huge Buffy fan and a HUGE fan of Alyson's work.Sure I think they could have taken out that nasty hairball scene because I couldn't eat my popcorn after that. And maybe they should have spoofed only two movies instead of thirty.

When Mel Brooks made a spoof movie, he usually made a funny one (the prime exception being \"Dracula: Dead and Loving It\") in part because he didn't inundate his movies with endless amounts of pop culture references. Instead, he actually put humor into his movie, not to mention actually telling one story that begins one place and ends in another.\n\nThese guys who made Date Movie obviously didn't know where to start and where to begin. I guess the movie's funny if you find it hilarious to identify which movies they are spoofing, as they have many obvious references to \"Bridget Jones' Diary\", \"Jerry MacGuire\", \"Meet The Parents\", \"Meet The Fockers\", \"My Best Friend's Wedding\", \"Wedding Crashers\", \"The Wedding Planner\", and most other movies that have the word Wedding in it. My problem with the movie was not that it was offensive or in bad taste. \"South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut\" was offensive, but it was funny. \"Borat\" was in very bad taste, but it was funny. This film was not funny, and I hated it probably more than I've ever hated any movie in my life.\n\nAll I can say is that after watching this movie and the atrocities that are unoriginally titled *(fill in the blank)* Movie, I just want to call the filmmakers up and just say, \"STOP! STOP MAKING STUPID MEANINGLESS UNFUNNY FILMS!\" Somehow this movie made enough money to merit a Scary Movie 5 and an Epic Movie, but no one I know likes these movies.

The focus is on romantic comedy, and admittedly spotting the references to My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Meet the Parents and When Harry Met Sally is occasionally fun, the latter was one of the better gags as well as the stunt on the motorcycle, but the scenes where they featured in were in general very overplayed. Also there are some very cheap laughs, a scene involving a diarrhoea-afflicted cat hardly is going to spark any wit or imagination now is it? The plot line is on the lame and predictable side, and the direction is next to non-existent. The acting isn't as atrocious as it was in Disaster Movie, which was a perfect example of how NOT to act in a movie, but a majority of it was lifeless. I like Alyson Hannigan, I confess when I was 11 I was addicted to Buffy the Vampire Slayer and still am, and I think she was trying her best with superficial material. It is just that newcomer Adam Campbell is extremely unexciting as her new boyfriend, and Carmen Electra shows visibly here that she can't act. The remainder of the acting is unexceptional. All in all, it is not unbearably awful, but I doubt I would ever want to see this film again. 3/10 Bethany Cox"

Well, like all these rotten parody films (such as \"Disaster Movie\" and \"Epic Movie\"), it is designed to appeal to teenagers and I cannot imagine adults enjoying it in any way. In fact, I really think most teens wouldn't enjoy it...mostly just the stupid ones.\n\nThe film sends up films like \"When Harry Met Sally\", \"Hitch\", \"Meet the Parents\", \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" and a variety of other romantic films as well as the TV show \"The Bachelor\". A few of the jokes are funny...most are just gross and stupid. If you like fat jokes, folks beating up hobos and really, really crude jokes (such as about cats relieving themselves and anal sex references)...you'll like the movie.\n\nOverall, the film was about as bad as I expected....without any sort of redeeming value...unless you are REALLY drunk or extraordinarily stupid.

Maybe the 450-odd IMDb reviewers who gave this film a \"10\" are rabid Alyson Hannigan fans, but believe me people, you'd be better off watching \"American Pie\" or stick to \"Buffy: The Vampire Slayer\". The poor girl tries her best, but the material just lets her down. I don't know why she agreed to sign on the dotted line for this pile of tripe. Maybe she just needed the money for food that month. She is so much better than this. I bet she wishes she could wipe this film from her C.V. I just wish I could wipe this film from my memory. Believe the hype. This is just about the worst movie ever made, and will surely be riding high at next years \"razzie\" awards. Don't see it. Please."

I like some romantic comedies but most of them are just a bunch of annoying clich\u00e9s so I was glad to hear about Date Movie. Unfortunately, the spoofs aren't creative at all. The film just recreates popular movie scenes without really adding anything special to them. A few of the jokes were funny while most of them were just stupid.\n\nThe blame should got to the writers who weren't trying very hard. Scary Movie did contain some lame material and it seemed like Date Movie copied all that lame material and put into one film. They made the most obvious spoofs without much creativity. I was hoping the preview wouldn't be an indication of what was to come but it portrayed the film perfectly so I can't same the advertising fooled me.\n\nThe acting was okay and there were a few funny performances. Alyson Hannigan was pretty pale and dull. She had a few funny lines but for the most part, her performance was pretty un-notable. Adam Campbell was okay, nothing special. Jennifer Coolidge was hilarious as Roz. She was defiantly the film's strongest point. Eddie Griffin was sadly underused and he didn't seem to be having a lot of fun either. The rest of the performances were all forgettable and they aren't worth mentioning. While Date Movie is a bust, it's also pretty harmless and it wasn't a complete waste of time. I really hate using that line but it's the best compliment I can give the film. In the end, the movie doesn't even warrant a rental, just skip it. Rating 3/10"

I am also a buffy fan and Alysson Hannigan plays a completely opposite character and it was funny to see her outside of the genre even though i am familiar with all the American Pies. I really don't get why people are giving this film such bad scores. Lightenen up a little, it was meant to give you a few good laughs and it did. Date Movie is a movie that i can rent again and watch,and still laugh at some of the material. Holla at cha boy!"

I will say that Alyson Hannigan certainly carried the movie quite well with her performance. And with the likes of Fred Willard, Jennifer Coolidge, Eddie Griffin and Tony Cox on the cast list as well, there are some familiar faces.\n\nThere are some good laughs here and there throughout the course of the 83 minutes that the movie runs for. However, directors Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg ultimately delivered a movie that just have contents to sustain a single viewing. There is little replay value to this 2006 spoof comedy.\n\nMy rating of \"Date Movie\" lands on a five out of ten stars."

Not so with \"Date Movie\". It's main purpose is to set up scenarios from certain movies just for the purpose of \u0085I'm not quite sure because humor certainly isn't the reason.\n\nOne problem with the film is that its core demographic, those who would enjoy lame scatological humor, are teens and a number of the films spoofed are before their time. During one scene in which the orgasm scene from \"When Harry Met Sally\" was mimicked, the audience I attended the screening with had no idea what film they were doing a take of.\n\nThere is not one redeeming thing about this film. It is unfortunate that Alyson Hannigan chose this script as her first top-lining film.

But since that is the requirements of this fine community known as the internet movie database i will do this. I could have written a better movie using my anus to hold the pen for the script. It is too bad that a girl such as Alyson Hannigan participated in this vomit bucket. She doesn't really show it but she does have talent to act in quirky roles. She is not going to win an academy award but she can do far better than this heaped together junk. If a movie has Eddie Griffin it is probably a wise decision to stay a distance from it."

I knew going into this that it was going to be stupid, but stupid humor can be great if it's done well. Almost every single joke in this movie fell flat. I chuckled a couple times, but other than that, nothing was funny AT ALL. I guess that some of the writers from Scary Movie worked on this. Scary Movie is FAR SUPERIOR and is one of the funniest spoofs I've ever seen. This movie is garbage. I thought Alyson Hannigan was funny in previous movies, but she had nothing to work with here. All the jokes were tired. Most of the theater (about 3/4 full) were not laughing as well. If popping huge zits, cats taking a poop in a toilet, and loud obnoxious farting are your thing, than you may like this. I think possibly teenagers would enjoy this movie, but even they may think it's stupid. The scenes from the romantic comedies they spoof are not even the funny scenes from those movies. I don't understand how somebody would make this and think it is good.\n\nI found out right before going into the theater that this was a PG-13 movie, and my expectations fell right there. If you are going to do a good parody, in my opinion, an R rating is needed. I think the R rating helped make Scary Movie so good.\n\nI gave this movie 2/10 only because Jennifer Coolidge is in it, and it's sad because she's a riot in EVERY OTHER MOVIE I've seen her.

To call it sophomoric would be elevating it by an order of magnitude.\n\nAs for the writing, if this was written by two of the 6 writers of Scary movie as the tag line suggests, we mus assume the other 4 writers had all of the talent. There are porn movies that are better written. I mean the cheap ones they sell in quick marts.\n\nAfter seeing this movie I felt like suing the studio to get my money back. Short of that I'll have to use a power drill to get the memory of it out of my head. Thats how bad this movie is."

The Meet the Parents/Fockers spoof was the funniest part of the film, and it really was not very funny. It is one of the most repetitive films ever and has disgusting sex jokes including a cat pulling out condoms getting ready to have sex with a dead grandma or gross jokes like Julia popping her pimple or Frank (Julia's father) getting a man's stumoch hair in his mouth and throwing up a hairball. It's absolutely disgusting and it has no plot. It's a bunch of 3 minute gags all thrown together with the same characters. The gags that could be slightly amusing are pulled out too long, like the Kill Bill gag. And they somehow fit a King Kong parody in here, which had to be the stupidest part of the film. I was totally disgusted in this movie, but in all honsety I've seen worse.\n\nMy rating: F. 71 mins. PG-13 for disgusting sex and poopoo jokes."

They both looked rather lame, but I thought that \"Date Movie\" might at least be funny. And for the first time in my life I walked out of the movie theater before it was even over. I tried to sit through the entire movie, not wanting my money to go to waste, but about an hour in I realized that my money was already wasted, so I might as well not waste another 30 minutes of my life sitting here. The gags were unoriginal and unfunny. A character unknowingly hitting and knocking someone over was funny maybe the first few times it was ever used in a movie. But it's not anymore. Stop it. None of the humor was clever, it was basically just being as gross as possible within the boundaries of a PG-13 movie and passing it off as funny. Matt Stone and Trey Parker manage to effectively use gross out comedy, because there is a passiveness to it. When the characters have a more subtle reaction to the vulgarity of the action at hand it just works as funny. But when people use it, like the people in this movie, where the characters have huge reactions, it just comes off as trying way way to hard to be funny. I hated the movie, but at least my popcorn was nice and buttery. I give my popcorn 8.5 out of 10 and this movie 1 out of ten. I'd give the movie less if I could."

You can't really make a movie thats making fun of other movies and have a total strong plot line. It had great funny moments, but the lead actor didn't really pull off his part. The Willow girl did pretty good in this film though. This is just a straight up laugh your a** off movie.I'm not one to like comedies because I don't find most of them very funny, but I did like this one.

That's creativity right there. And speaking of shivers down my spine, what's with the huge gross-out factor in this movie? There are snuff movies less disgusting than this one. I guess gross-out can be funny somehow someway, but I really didn't need constant close-ups of moles, back hair, liposuction fat and Sophie Monk. Disturbing stuff. And I guess I should feel sad for everyone involved, but why must Alyson Hannigan do this to me? I guess it's a paycheck, but I would really hate to see the screenplays she rejects, if any.

This piece of garbage otherwise known as date movie IS BY FAR the worst movie i have ever seen in my life. I knew going in it would be bad, but i saw a glimmer of hope in a couple of parts. This movie was absolutely terrible. From the cat in the washroom to the basketball scene, this movie is the real deal(the WORst movie).

The scary movies use one movie for the basic plot, and then use a few other movies for basic jokes. The date movie has its own plot line, and uses too many movies to get jokes. It makes it seem as if they were desperate to make a funny movie, so they had to stick all these other movies to try and make it funny. I rate it a 3/10 because it was disgusting and not funny at all. The only fun I had watching it was naming the movie(s) it was referring to in EVERY scene. I recommend you don't watch this movie.

I went into the theater expecting something hilarious, and mind numbingly funny, I got something really disappointing. The acting was not at all at fault, the writing and half witted spoofing is. Like the run on series Scary Movies this just fails to make you want more. It's strikingly similar to Not Another Teen Movie, but cheesier jokes, dumber humor, and there was nothing clever about it.

This movie took funny jokes from good movies such as Meet the parents and turned them into awful jokes that were done in extremely bad taste.

It, like its successor films, \"Epic Movie\" and \"Meet the Spartans\", is not very deft at spoofing specific films, and some of the parodies fall flat. This movie does succeed because it has competent, enthusiastic actors, and a coherent plot that includes the basics of what a romantic movie should have: conflict, a plucky lovelorn heroine, and a happy resolution, with all loose ends tied up. Allison Hannigan, of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" fame, is absolutely endearing, charming, and hilarious as the embattled protagonist, Julia. Adam Campbell, Sophie Monk, Eddie Griffin, and Jennifer Coolidge do their utmost to make this farce a success. It is because of them that this movie stays afloat, whereas lesser comedians would have tanked this film. Their talents, as well as their understanding that this is a farce that requires to be over-the-top, make this the most watchable romantic \"comedy\" ever.\n\nIn spite of the superb acting in this movie, there are many gags that are awful. The \"Harry Met Sally\" gag is just too overlong and not funny in the least. Some of the \"Meet the Parent\" gags don't work. Ironically, it is the original story within the movie, rather than the parodies of any specific movie, that are the funniest parts of the movie. They balance out the poorly-written parody gags and somehow keep this comedy afloat. I recommend \"Date Movie\", especially to those who hate romantic movies or those who appreciate fine comedic acting in the same vein as a Mel Brooks or Zucker and Abrams film. \"Epic Movie\" and \"Meet the Spartans\" are improvement, but \"Date Movie\" is still funny enough not to pass up."

Yes its plot is extremely thin, yes it is nothing but a bunch of rather poorly done parodies of the more successful films over the last 20 years. But what I think you fail to understand is that is the point. It isn't supposed to be a cleverly made Oscar winning masterpiece, it is purely designed to give a few laughs. Now some of the scenes to be sure are more disgusting than funny (hairball), but many of the scenes do indeed have a lot of humour in them. The audience I attended the movie with laughed fairly constantly throughout and no wonder.\n\nI think it all comes down to a matter of taste in the end. Date Movie, like its predecessors of the Scary and Teen persona, follows the basic plot line of the genre it is spoofing very loosely, but with enough innovation to be enjoyable and the spoofs are in fact quite cleverly conceived. They aren't hilarious skits such as you would find in Flying High, but they are amusing enough and while it certainly helps to have seen the movies spoofed, most of the jokes are obvious enough to work on their own.\n\nIn short, the film is funny as long as you don't go into it with high expectations. Not as good as its predecessors, but it still works. I won't be buying the DVD, but I'll be sure to watch it on TV one day. After all, it is in the end a cheap laugh and a good way to wind down of the evening."

From there on out, it just got sick, twisted, and fully worthy of a -8 or -9 stars out of 10. The Scary movie serials weren't this bad, and they at least made some attempt to create an original plot. All that occurred here were some familiar scenes from well known movies acted out word for word. So be it, they were modified in execution to make them more crass and disgusting, but there was no significant variance on the originals. It was good in one way, FOR ME TO POOP ON!"

At least the Scary Movie franchise does have some laughs, but this didn't. The movie parodies several recent comedies, most notably Meet the Parents, The Wedding Planner. If I had to point out one thing that was not absolutely horrible, it would have to be Eddie Griffin; he's not really funny in this, but he does have the potential to be funny and have liked him in other films.\n\nAs for Allison Hannigan, is this really the only place she has to go after the American Pie movies. She wasn't bad in them. Too bad she can't get better parts.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: Pure trash."

But then, I only stayed for about 20 minutes because I couldn't stand it. It was just so disgusting, stupid, perverted and any other synonyms of those words.\n\nPLEASE do not waste your money on this film. It will just waste part of your life. There is nothing funny about this movies, unless you like watching sick things. I wish I had asked for my money back, but luckily another movie had just started in the theatre next door.\n\nI wish I could give this movie a negative number.

Campbell is actually a rather good actor, and he doesn't let on how bad he must know the film is. He puts in a lot of effort to something that is overall crap. The most telling scene of spastic stupidity comes from the Meet the Parents scene. It takes the jokes FROM that film and repeats them in exaggerated ways that suck out all of the humour."

I even enjoy chick flick comedies, like Mean Girls and Legally Blonde. You can keep your artsy, overly dramatic and elitist movies.\n\nOh, wait, this isn't about me, it's about the Date Movie. Well, the gags, even if semi-funny are drawn way out. The spoofs have no rhyme or reason to them, but the plot (what plot?) moves along. The acting is fair.\n\nI try not to over-analyze movies, just enjoy them. After watching Clerks the day before, Date Movie was a breath of fresh air. I just couldn't let the 2.7 stand, although I cannot muster any more than a 7 myself, and that's just in protest.\n\nSuggestion: Watch the deleted and extended scenes on the DVD and you will know that Date Movie could have been worse!"

She/he asks you to organise the first date. \"A meal and the cinema?\", you offer. \"Sure, what film?\", they reply. You look at the availability of films. Date Movie appears. \"What could possibly go wrong?\". Five minutes in, after eating your luxurious McChicken sandwich meal at McDonalds (because you're cheap), you vomit it back up after watching Hannigan in a fat suit shake water off her body like a beached whale. \"This, was a bad idea!\". Suffice to say, you did not obtain that elusive second date, and thankfully this parody-fuelled nightmare did not receive a sequel.\n\nSpoofs can be funny when intelligently incorporated into a story that do not rely on profanity and obtuse humour. The first 'Scary Movie' for example, took the genre it was parodying and intellectually flipped it to mock the traits it commonly utilises. Date Movie, well, isn't that. It's a game. A game of \"how many films can you shout out before your opponent?\". There's atleast thirty points up for grabs here. From romantic comedies ('Bridget Jones Diary', 'Shallow Hal' etc.) to random popular blockbusters ('King Kong', Kill Bill' etc.). The 'Meet The Parents' and 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' parodies act as the central narrative, with a plethora of random sketches embedded throughout. Problem is, they're aren't funny. At all.\n\nA cat licking the tongue of a corpse from an urn? Popping a gargantuan spot in front of a mirror? Undergoing a miraculous makeover, 'Pimp My Ride' style, involving waxing the hairiest back possible and clipping odorous toe nails? Stop it! Cheap sketches in a bid to make younger audiences laugh, but if anything, forces them to turn away and belch. Some scenes didn't even make any sense whatsoever! The 'Step Up' dance sequence with 'Hitch'? I...I don't get it.\n\nBoth applause and hisses must be given to the cast. Each of them, Hannigan in particular, hold no reservations and go full throttle. But why? Why subject yourselves to this monstrosity? Were your careers really that stale that you had to re-enact the 'When Harry Met Sally' orgasm scene? Jennifer Lopez is parodied in this, as is Michael Jackson. No idea why, they just are.\n\nAt this point in time, nothing makes sense. Hilarity is non-existent. Vulgarity is everything. And if you hadn't atleast exclaimed \"ewww!\" before that basketball scene with the homemade waxing method, then you certainly are a more ferocious warrior than myself. Date Movie is a stain on Hollywood that, unsurprisingly, made room for more pointless endeavours..."

Think of half-funny scenes from other movies, poorly re-enacted, all pieced together with ginger minger Alison Hannigan and the result is Date Movie.\n\nI rented this and watched it with my bro. From the very beginning I kept thinking \"this isn't funny... this isn't funny\", but wholeheartedly expected it to pick up. It didn't. And after about 40 minutes of lame jokes I just couldn't take anymore and switched it off.\n\nI met my friend the next day and said \"I just watched the worst movie ever\"... and he instantly asked if it was \"Date movie\"...\n\nSince then if I'm ever in a video store I always put other movies in front of the date movie box so other people don't make the same mistake and rent possibly the worst movie ever.\n\nInteresting side-note, my sister went to Epic Movie when it was released in the cinema and said it was the worst movie ever. I'd love to see which is actually the worst movie ever, but I just couldn't bring myself to watch Epic Movie knowing it was made by the same losers who made Date Movie."

Don't even mention the deader-than-dead character clich\u00e9s (like the \"filthy-mouthed dwarf\" routine). The whole premise of doing a parody of comedies is moronic to begin with. Make a comedy out of a comedy--that's what it amounts to, that these talentless hacks were doing, er, trying to do, that is. They failed. In every way imaginable. And just when you thought this tripe was over, they ran a montage of every unfunny attempt at humor from the whole movie all over again.\n\nThis is movie-making at its most pathetic.

Scary Movie 2, 3, and 4 got progressively got weaker. But \"Date Movie\" was the final nail in the coffin for \"spoof\" movies as far as I'm concerned. And Hollywood isn't through yet! Ooooooh no. Now there is \"Epic Movie\" to rob naive viewers of their money. I, for one, am not watching that one unless I don't have to pay money for it. And thats not all! We have Scary Movie 5 to look forward to in 2008! Wonderful! Hollywood is dead.\n\nDate Movie is very very clich\u00e9d, with your typical useless Hollywood references, disgusting humor (not the funny kind), drawn-out jokes beaten-to-death-thus-rendering-them-useless, and predictability comparable to the fact that the sun is going to rise tomorrow (in most parts of the world, at least). I sat through this whole thing, and got a few short bursts of laughter out of it. After about an hour, I kept checking the clock to see if it was over yet. This movie gets three stars simply because of the Napoleon Dynamite spoof. I hate that movie."

And of course the ultimate question: what is most boring, watching this movie or watching paint dry? Actually i guess pain might make some nice patterns or something while drying so...\n\nThe truth here is that there are so many talentless people involved in this project. The two directors (also script-writers) Friedberg/Seltzer are responsible for the scripts to some real crap so i didn't expect much. But still the Scary Movie-franchise, boring as it may be, is still a lot better than this crap. This movie displays a complete ignorance as to what makes comedy work. Inane spoofs are mixed with plump jokes about fat people, sex and feces. Comedy on a low level can work but it needs to be done with a lot more style than here.\n\nBad comedy is almost painful to watch, and this movie hurt.

It was so awful because it was poorly constructed and written, it took no talent to take parts from other movies and changed it ever so slightly to make it 'funny'. It would have been funny to the writers when they've gone out and gotten drunk, which is probably how they went about to get this piece of rubbish written.\n\nWe've all gotten drunk and discussed how to make something funny, however we wouldn't make a movie out of it.\n\nThe only thing that was good about the movie was it's cast. They chose the best actors to suit the job and that's the best they could do.\n\nGod help them if they chose a different cast that did a poor job on the movie.\n\nThe humour was very immature, admittedly I like immature humour but they did a ghastly job on that too.\n\nThis movie suits a person with a simple sense of humour such as a 12 year old or someone who prefers a different genre of movie who seeks out for a funny movie.\n\nIronically this movie is rated for over 15 years old and even people with simple tastes cannot bear this movie.\n\nSo I'll warn you now not to go and see this movie at the cinema, I suggest getting it at a very cheap cost such as rental or digging it out at your local video shops bargain bin."

Crude, ridiculous and so unfunny that you'll feel like walking out every 5 minutes until the film is finally over and you're put out of your misery.\n\nAfter the novelty of the fat suit is milked for everything its worth, the writers decide they need some eye candy to stop the boys tuning out, which is solved by a ludicrous \"pimp her out\" section where stereotypical black mechanics \"pimp\" Julia, and, voila! One rap song and a tool box later and Julia is a sizzling sexpot ready to embark on a journey of finding true love, on a game show where the bachelor is told to \"shoot the girls you don't want to bang\".\n\nThe bachelor, Grant, and Julia then soon fall in love after a date of beating up homeless people, and become engaged which is complicated by Grants best \"man\" Andie- a conniving blonde bimbo out to steal Grant back.\n\nWhilst films of a similar vein, such as Scary movie, are well observed and actually funny, Date Movie takes the concept too far. It is TOO gross, TOO unrealistic and tries far TOO hard. The writers of this drivel, who happen to be two of the writers of scary movie (apparently the worst ones) fail to realise that the genre of romantic comedy spoofs has been done. The under-rated \"not another teen movie\" is a witty film which exposes Date Movie as utter, un thought-out tripe.\n\nOne of the many bad bits of the film is a scene in which a constipated cat is sat on the toilet for two long minutes, with accompanying facial expressions and repulsive sound effects. This may fare well with people aged 11-13 with an immature sense of humour, but its likely most people will sit in stunned silence throughout this entire saga.\n\nIn fact, said cat is likely to become an icon for the younger, less intelligent teenagers in the audience. After his toilet troubles he also rapes a skeleton and has sex with an old lady. Think I'm lying? Unfortunately I'm not.\n\nRemotely intelligent viewers may also wonder why Caucasian Julia has an African American dad, an Indian mum and a Japanese sister. Well the answer is simple. It invites racist jokes and is used as a window for unimaginative character stereotyping.\n\nA parody of \"Hitch\" is also a low point. A midget love doctor named Hitch helps Julia with her dating techniques by flossing a chicken wing out of her teeth. I was expecting the writers to rename him \"Titch\" but perhaps that kind of joke was too sophisticated for them.\n\nA parody of The Wedding Planner starring a Latina named Jell-O, with a cushion shoved down her trousers, also misses the mark and is yet another cheap ploy for laughs. Cue the tumbleweed.\n\nThe acting in Date Movie is also well below par. Julia is far too whiny whilst Grant's accent starts to grind after the first few minutes. But does it really matter when the actors look the part? The casting directors seem to think not, yet evidently, yes, it does.\n\nOf course, tired Michael Jackson jokes where he moon dances and tries to seduce a young boy are featured too, which should please the youngsters who have read Michael Jackson's exploits in The Sun, but many will simply roll their eyes at something which is overdone and usually more effectively done.\n\nMale viewers may be momentarily entertained by the three minute scene where Andie- a Paris Hilton clone- dances around in a bikini, washes a car and eats a banana, simply to drum into the audience that she is Julia's love rival and is conventionally sexier, but Date Movie is generally not at all entertaining.\n\nOf course there will be exceptions. I'm sure young teenagers seeking non-intelligent films full of fart jokes will lap Date Movie up, but chances are everyone else will leave the cinemas bored, disgusted and wanting a refund.\n\nTo sum up, the best thing about Date Movie is that it only lasts 83 minutes, the worst thing is everything else.\n\nTo those of you considering going to see date Movie, one word of advice; DON'T."

After viewing this movie, myself and others walked out looking half dazed, half wanting to vomit in our wallets for ever taking the money out to invest in such a ticket. From the beginning to the end, this movie was shocking. I'll give it to the directors for being so spot on with the\n\nparodies, but after at least 50 references to movies of the past 5 years, it gets older then the stench of pure hate in the theatre. The first few minutes show a spoof of Napolean Dynamite. How dare they. That was when I realized that it was indeed a waste. The minutes that followed involved crude humour, revolting antics, and was very very unfunny. The funniest bit was Grant imitating Mr and Mrs Smith and talking about smothering Julia. The rest was complete and utter crap. The ending was not expected. Just kidding. The plot outline had nothing but gooey love crap behind it, and maybe some hair balls and penis references. Michael Jackson spoofs were quite funny, simply because he was in the background, whilst the nauseating \"actors\" were int he foreground. Sophie Monk, that hideous bucked tooth woman, took up about a good 40 minutes of this movie. Not only can she not act, but she also can't sing, dance, or look good. Her part in the movie didn't so much as make it better, it made it dreadful. Too much Sophie Monk makes any person want to be propelled into a brick wall. Fair enough she's Australian, but also fair enough she is scamming into any movie she can get her hands onto. If you like seeing movies, don't be swayed to see this one. This is not a movie. This is some retarded puzzle that no one quite can fit together. Not all it's cracked up to be. The ad's lie. Your friends lie. I don't."

I was rather disappointed when I sat in the theater and considered trying to get my money back. The movie is decent, however, it is not nearly worth the seven dollars to see it. I recommend watching this movie when it comes to television. Also, this movie is filled with adult sexual-related context and was surprising to see so many younger patrons there not understanding the sexual content. The actors were not too bad, however, the script really was just an attempt to gain cheap laughs and spoof classic movies. It was a disappointment to see this movie, in my opinion."

I was horrified from what they put on the screen in front of an audience filled with 14 year old kids. I think that this movie should get 2 thumbs down. And I mean WAY down.

I honestly believe that the best parts of the movie were for one, the previews, and two, the 10 second period of having my eyes closed out of sheer disgust. I highly suggest that anyone thinking of seeing this movie should first be warned that those few moments between scenes when nothing is going on will be the best parts. Yes, i did laugh, but the reason i laughed the few times i did was because some parts were mildly funny but they were so overpowered by the sheer badness of the movie that I believe that i actually cried, and thats not a joke. Movies like this just make me wonder how such HORRIBLE movies can make fun of some decent movies. Its actually funny, that i like almost every movie that i have ever seen, except this one. I walked away from the theater terrified and wondering if I will ever be back. I lost all respect for all actors in that movie, most of whom i liked before. It just goes to show that whenever you put Carmen Electra and Lil John in a movie, the result is pure trash. I highly suggest to anyone even thinking about going to see this, first boar out your eyes with a pencil to make the movie more enjoyable."

It's unheard of and useless. I guess, in this case, all you do is take material and scenes from those films and mash them into a loaf, making once entertaining sequences and quotes a bleak excuse to waste a few hundred million on placing a roll on a reel.\n\nHey...It's not the cast's fault. Alyson Hannigan, as cute as she is talented, does what she can with the script that was thrown at her. It is nice to see her back on the screen, because I kind of dislike CBS's boring sitcom, HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER (trust me, she's the light on that otherwise dark, dreary Monday night time slot). Tim Meadows, a fine comic actor, seems to be out of work these days. Sure, we all loved him in LADIES MAN, and I was taken by surprise when he showed up in MEAN GIRLS (shut up...I liked that one, too). Hee hee...TV legend Fred Willard shows up a bit. Sadly, it's a far cry from his amazing performance in ANCHOR MAN and ends up just being a pitiful desperation to star in more movies. All else...none of the other cast members are worth mentioning. In fact, the whole movie in general isn't worth mentioning. The only thing I enjoyed here was Carmen Electra's nice cameo (it was ruined, however, by a KING KONG parody and a sex-crazed 12 year old native boy snapping pictures with his cell phone camera. The nerve).\n\nI don't want to offend, but when I sat through what they claimed was a motion picture, I began to envy the seeing and hearing impaired, praying to God to have both placed upon me until the film's rolling credits were either starting or gone all together. Truly...I was that depressed by it.\n\nNot laughing a single time reminded me of watching episodes of WHO'S LINE IS IT ANYWAY? or THE NANNY...hell, especially GIRLFRIENDS.\n\nHollywood seems to let it all happen: Scientology, Hugh Grant's blowjob, gay cowboys, and DATE MOVIE. Nothing works anymore. It's as dry as a hillbilly's shower curtain. I used to want to fight for the return of Hollywood's Golden Age...but right now I ask: is it worth it?\n\nFace it folks, DATE MOVIE is proof that filmmakers will make anything and viewers will view anything. Which one is the dumber of the two is a decision I'll let you, the nice reader, figure out after the big summer blockbuster run. Enjoy what little you can."

OK, this demonstrates how low the level of funniness in this film was - I found Passion of the Christ a lot more amusing (when Jesus tells Mary that tables and chairs will take off one day!).\n\nSeriously, I cannot understand any Hollywood studio even considered to put their name to this trash. Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer should look to seek refuge in Libya or somewhere - especially when the Razzies come around - i'm sure they'll have a clean sweep.\n\nThere was a 'possibility' for this film to do well, as it had all the ingredients for a successful spoof - the ingredients being 'other films'. But Friedberg managed to make a total cock-up of something a kid in school could have done a better job with - he lacks that knowledge that the Wayans brothers (or anybody's brothers) have.\n\nPlease save your money, and reduce the amount of money this film brings in. I had no choice but to watch it as I had seen everything else which was showing; but if you can watch 'anything' else, please do so - otherwise, leave all sharp objects at home, and, jokes aside: certainly leave any semi-suicidal people at home, we don't want a bloodbath."

It's like they tried way too hard to get a laugh with some things (or didn't try hard enough). The acting was poor, and the writing was even worse. This is definitely the top runner in next year's Razzie's. I honestly believe the movie theater would have to pay me $10 to sit through this movie. But to anyone reading this, please please please don't waste your money on seeing this movie."

Very few people are afraid to talk about movies like this because if they say they like it their opinion is silenced with death threats. Stop being ignorant you guys. This movie is not hilarious by any means but it is funny in some parts.\n\nJulia Jones is a overweight Greek, Indian, Japanese Jew who works at her parent's Greek restaurant. She meets the perfect man and becomes beautiful later on. They plan to get married but will her farther approve of this and will another woman get in the way? The Casting for this film was the start of casting the same people in all of their movies. Tony Cox, Adam Campbell and Carmen Electra are most of the people who show up in these kinds of movies.\n\nFriedberg and Seltzer prove that you don't need good jokes to make a good movie. You can have good and bad jokes as well to make a good movie. I love slapstick in these type of movies because they work so well. For me that is, because my taste in comedy is different then everyone Else's. One of my favorite jokes is the beginning of the film where Julia dances on the street to get a man but fails and falls flat.\n\nBut the second half and third act of this film isn't quite that funny. Sure there is a laugh here and there but its not like there are so many at once. I guess they were being more serious with this movie then any of they're other parodies.\n\nDate Movie is not perfect by any means necessary. But it is funny for me. By the way, Im going to be reviewing all of their films. So you just stay tuned for the same stuff! 79/100 B"

Just about every moment with Tony Cox was absolute gold, especially the first scene we meet him as the Hitch wannabe.\n\nGranted, there were a few scenes in this movie that were absolutely horrible (the Meet the Fockers stuff and the Closer scene), but beyond that, I didn't fall asleep.

The humor lacks any and all subtlety, making it great for the viewer who doesn't want to have to think about a joke and just wants to laugh at how fat someone is or that a cat is taking a crap.

I'm ashamed to admit this, but unlike some of the more intelligent people on this site, I actually sat through the whole thing.Why?Well, for one thing, the movie did have one redeeming feature-a hot guy with a British accent.Also,I wasn't sure I would get a refund for the $8 I paid.\n\n2006 is still young and more bad movies are sure to come, but this one definitely deserves a Razzie!"

I bet even the march of the penguin was better than this movie. I'm telling ya don't waste your money or time on this movie. It didn't even make sense. Out of the whole movie I only laughed twice. I actually almost fell asleep in the movie theater. Instead of watching the movie I was talking through the whole movie. Please don't torture yourself with this movie. I actually called my boyfriend while watching the movie. The movie is not even funny its really over exaggerating. Go watch Family Reunion instead. That's my advice."

However I put people's views to one side and decided to go and see for myself. All I can say is this film is very funny and I really enjoyed it. If your like me and enjoy spoofs and films such as scary movie then this film is for. You have to be opened minded when watching this film and appreciate the efforts gone into the humour. The directors included many films that they mocked such as Meet the Fockers and Hitch which was very amusing. All I can say is that is this is a light hearted film with loads of humour that can make you laugh every time you watch it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Presumably from the people who brought you SCARY MOVIE, DATE MOVIE is a an amusing take-off on the genre of film-making most commonly referred to as the \"Chick Flick.\" This film follows the romance between a former fatty named Julia Jones (Alyson Hannigan)and a young man named Grant Funkyordoter (Adam Campbell). As expected, this film takes pretty accurate pot-shots at films like WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, PRETTY WOMAN, MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING, BRIDGET JONES' DIARY, MEET THE PARENTS, MEET THE FOCKERS, NOTTING HILL, and MY BIG FAT Greek WEDDING. Hannigan, a proved farceur thanks to her work in the American PIE movies and the CBS series HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER, plays Julia with sincerity and energy and Adam Campbell, who looks like David Spade and sounds like Hugh Grant, perfectly inhabits the role of Adam. There are also funny bits contributed along the way by Eddie Griffin, Fred Willard, Jennifer Collidge (in a dead-on spoof of Streisand in MEET THE FOCKERS), Sophie Monk, and Tony Cox. It's become fashionable to trash films of this ilk, but it held my attention and made me laugh and if you're looking for a film that will tickle the funny bone, laughs can be had here."

Just about anything would have been better than this, and in 'anything' I include listening to nails and chalk scratch across a blackboard while receiving Chinese water torture and being flogged--all at the same time. This movie has absolutely nothing to offer. If you happen to come into contact with the DVD or video tape of the film, the only appropriate thing to do with it would be to discard of it immediately and in a way that will remove it from the Earth forever."

This movie is absolute crap from beginning to end, with stupid parodies of movies that many people haven't seen. Here's a tip for whoever directed this, don't parody romantic comedies. EVER! Look at the success of the Scary Movie franchise, those movies are good because the people that make them know how to parody scary movies with hilarious results. This shouldn't've been made in the first place, and for a good reason. THIS MOVIE BLOWS! 1/10"

A lot of comments complain about the film's fat phobia, however the suit only features in the first 15 minutes of the film.\n\nHalf of the jokes fail miserably such as the hairball joke, but some work fine. It's quite quickfire, lowbrow humour and there's nothing very complex in here, but for a parody film from the mid 2000s you couldn't expect anything else.\n\nActing is decent for the genre, Eddie Murphy actually is quite funny as Julia Jones' father.\n\nCinematography and choreography are also decent and it looks professionally done and not cheap.\n\nMediocre comedy but not one of the worst ever made."

It really isn't *that* bad.\n\nMovies like this are generally made as super light comedies: a series of sketches rather than a movie with a plot. That is what you should expect, and if you want more you will just be disappointed.\n\nIf you are looking for something to stimulate your intellectuality, then perhaps you should try books instead?

I am rarely the person who says \"that was crap\". Usually, I'll like a thing even if it sucks. I'll say \"well. It had its moments\". But this movie. No way. It was so bad I was tempted to ask for my money back. I barely laughed once, mind you, the 12-year-olds in the row in front laughed plenty at the fart jokes, but frankly, I'd seen better. I have an older brother. If anyone reading this hasn't seen the movie, and are a bit like me - would be inclined to give it the benefit of the doubt - then well, see for yourself.

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie had some promise and after seeing the promos I definitely felt this would have been a funny movie, then I saw the UNRATED DVD and I couldn't resist borrowing it.\n\nFirstly the unrated DVD could well have a PG-13 rating this movie has nothing even bordering on nudity (a bikini clad girl is the max you will see), ignoring this however, this movie completely let my expectations down.\n\nA spoof that came to my mind before I watched this movie was Not Another Teen Movie which was hilarious in its approach how it took almost all popular teen movies and attacked the stereotypes in them. That movie had proper direction and some great jokes (and some hot exposure hehe) even though it specifically spoofed only Teen Movies.\n\nThis movie had the wider canvas of all romantic comedies and even though this gave the movie more potential this also proved to be the movies undoing. This movie had no direction it chose to spoof almost any movie (such as kill bill and went of track a fatal mistake in spoofs) and spoofed movies that were not necessarily legendary. The spoofs were repetitive, to slapstick and focused to much on my best friends wedding.\n\nThe acting was good (from the entire cast) given the limited premise of the movie but too much focus was given on Alyson who has no screen presence and is incapable of carrying a movie on her extra thin shoulders. She may have had some success in multi-star movies but she has neither the capabilities nor the charisma to be the star of a movie.\n\nThe movie started of on a high not with the take on Shallow Hal and the opening scene was brilliant setting my expectations very high and making the disaster that followed all the more unbearable.\n\nThe movie progressively got more and more stupid and after the 35th minute around where Sophie Monk manages to break up the marriage is where the movie becomes truly unbearable. The other half hour of the movie is hideous and you spend the entire time hoping this movie was over.\n\nThe movie has its moments though such the hilarious opening sequence and the scene where the gorgeous Sophie Monk is introduced.\n\nSophie Monk I daresay was the only saving grace in this movie with her spectacular looks and her hilarious take on Paris.\n\nThis movie has a host of scattered moments throughout the movie they are few and far between you are probably better of watching the teasers or the 6 min movie (called the quickie) on the DVD.\n\nThe songs in this movie were one thing that were well put to use and provided some relief when they were played.\n\nA few scenes such as the extended family dinner and the singing of say a prayer, the fake orgasm, and scenes involving the parents were absolutely unbearable.\n\nA movie that may have its moments provided you are able to leave all your senses aside but not even as funny as its teaser.\n\nWatch only if you are super lover of spoofs or if you want to torture yourself.\n\n+s short length, a few great scenes , good jokes but funnier in the teaser, Sophie monk\n\n-s no direction whatsoever, Alyson,s non-star abilities, misguiding unrated DVD, tooooo stupid in parts, TOTAL WASTE OF POTENTIAL.\n\ntotal 3.5/10"

Oh how Marlon and Shawn must be laughing, because this really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! On the way in to the cinema, I was queuing up for my ticket, when one of the employees, who I occasionally have a quick chat to, advised me not to go and see this movie, I thanked him but said that there have been other movies people have advised me against watching which I really enjoyed.(Pearl Harbor, I am ashamed to say), however, after the movie I saw him in the foyer and offered my apologies, it really was that bad. Alyson Hannigan is not a leading lady, she cant carry it off unlike other teen movie stars (eg, Gellar, Love Hewitt), let alone in a movie like this. Eddie Griffin tries his hardest, but with such a weak character being written for him, he doesn't get his chance to shine. Adam Campbell, the male lead, battles on heroically, but as a rookie in the business, you wonder whether this movie has set him back before he has even got started. Please avoid this movie at all costs, stick with the Scary Movies, because they know how to make fun of other movies, this is a shocking crash-and-burn attempt."

Scene's including an orgasmic food order and a cat defecating for several minutes in a toilet, are juvenile at best, yet deliver the chuckles! A scene involving a transvestite \"Pretty Women\" agreeing to engage in sodomy with another women proved to be especially amusing. I also found it hilarious when the princess of the story finds herself being pimped much like the cars on pimp my ride.\n\nThe failed attempts... A brief attempt at Parodying \"Napoleon Dynamite\" was made, unfortunately it failed to be as funny as the already comical original. The \"Meet the Fockers\" parody was exactly the same as the original film, and although amusing, was half-a**ed and not in the true spirit of parody.\n\nBottom Line- Could the film have been better?

In fact, I really enjoyed reading the bad reviews, i've never seen a movie so conclusively and consistently panned before.\n\nThe reviews were so uniform I almost didn't watch the movie. But what the hell, I just HAD to see for myself. Could it REALLY be THAT bad? Well... no. Actually, not only was it NOT as awful as people were saying, I really rather enjoyed it. It certainly wasn't an instant classic or a literary masterpiece, but what spoof is? This made me think... how come I enjoyed it when so many people seemed to hate it? It almost suggests that either I'm utterly weird (I don't really think I am), incredibly childish (um.. no... not that I know of) or the people who write reviews on IMDb are cut from similar cloth.\n\nIn fact, the movie really IS quite funny, as long as you enjoy this sort of comedy. The person who compared it to Kung Pow was on the mark, I think. If you liked Kung Pow's humour, you'll probably like this. But I don't agree that it was anywhere near as sick as most people painted it. Some of the American Pie stuff was as gross as this, and don't even get me started on \"Freddie Got Fingered\" or \"Something About Mary.\" This is no worse than the nasty bits in those, so if you can get behind this sort of humour you won't come out morally outraged.\n\nThe comments about it \"having no plot\" and the parodies seeming \"pointless and too sudden\" are, in my opinion, absolute nonsense. It's a very silly movie, don't get me wrong, but it WANTS to be a silly movie. It was made for people who like silly movies. It's the perfect counterbalance to the bloated full-of-their-own-importance movies of the moment.\n\nAs for the \"awful degradation\" of the homeless, the fat, midgets etc etc etc.... I can't help but think the people who write these reviews aren't anywhere near as smart as they like to think they are. This is a SPOOF. All the things that this movie takes shots at come from *other* movies, or TV shows, or whatever. This is just putting a light on things that are done elsewhere. That's what a parody DOES.\n\nLots of people complained that the movie Parodies good movies they enjoyed like \"Meet The Parents\". Sure, it does. But a parody isn't an insult. A parody is a poke of fun which carries with it some respect for the original, or at least an appreciation that the film is worth a parody. I can't understand the comments that \"it just repeats the scene and adds nothing\". That's completely wrong. Take the scene where the Vase is hit thats from Meet The Parents. That's not a copy. Something is definitely added, and I thought it was pretty clever and very funny. All the clips from other movies were well done and amusing.\n\nIf you are a fully-paid card-carrying member of the politically-correct brigade you will hate, hate, hate this movie. And you will try to run down anybody who doesn't agree with you.\n\nThe main problem with this movie is that its a little TOO clever and subtle to reach some of its audience, but its way too puerile to satisfy the intellectuals. Oh and the liberal crusaders are going to hate every second of it. So, whose gonna like it? Well... all those people in the middle, I guess. And me, for sure."

The crude jokes and potty humor weren't enough to save this movie from making it a big disaster. It was so bad I don't even want to write a summary about it.\n\nAll I'll say is that it spoofs off from many romantic comedies. King Kong, The Wedding Planner, Hitch, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, When Harry Met Sally, Kill Bill, Along Came Polly, Meet the Fockers, Meet the Parents, Bridget Jones' Diary, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, Sleepless in Seattle, Say Anything, My Best Friend's Wedding, and others. It also included a spoof on the hit TV show, The Bachelor and a spoof on Paris Hilton's burger commercial and Jessica Simpson's car wash scene in her video, 'These Boots Are Made For Walking'. Basically they put too many spoofs in one to make something that should have been funny into something awful. And these are the people who wrote 'Scary Movie'. Perhaps spoofs on scary movies are funnier to do then spoofs on romantic ones.\n\nThe one thing I'm thankful for is that I waited to see this movie at the $1.99 movie theater in my hometown. The ending was better though. the one scene I loved was the Britney Spears/ Kevin Federline scene, in which Britney says she made a mistake hooking up with a back up singer and Kevin saying, \"I got Britney Spears. I'm rich, I'm rich\". But regardless, don't go see this movie. Trust me you won't like it."

Instead you have a movie that was written by people who lack any sense of humor. A woman washing a car is sexy, but when you make her rub herself during that scene with hamburgers, it's not sexy. Nor is it hilarious, funny, or even mildly amusing. You end up wondering why someone would really think this is funny, or that they wasted a perfectly good hamburger to make this garbage pile of movie.\n\nIf your faced with a choice between this movie and swallowing 23,000 cyanide pills, suicide is your only option."

There wasn't a single original thought in the film. The point of a parody is to take a scene from another movie and add a satirical element to it that generates humor. This movie seems to be content in just shoving in scenes from other movies, without any humorous elements added. For example they were in the middle of a Kill Bill parody scene when they cut to a flashback sequence of alyson hannigan in bed getting hit by a character from dodgeball, then back to the kill bill parody which in itself ended up being pretty poor. In the end, all the parodies were less than funny. Nothing like the fun \"Not Another Teen Movie\" and the \"Scary Movie\" franchises. Alyson Hannigan did alright i guess, but everyone else involved, even the brilliant Fred Willard should try to forget they ever did this movie.\n\nSummation: I feel dumber after watching this film. One of the worst movies ever. Negative 1 stars out of 100"

And although I don't have problems with any of the actors cast in this film, I must say their chemistry is probably the worst I've ever seen, ever. Ironically the funniest scene in the movie was with Shaq and Dr. Phil...no wait that was Scary Movie 4, I guess Date Movie didn't have any funny scenes.\n\nI gave 5 points just out of pity for having a good comedic idea ruined by poor directing and horrid acting. I'm sure if this were remade properly with a different cast it could potentially be side-splitting hilarious. As it is, don't see this movie unless someone else is paying for it, and you really have nothing else to do."

It also abuses many favorites, including the Ring trilogy and Napolean Dynamite (both of which should be thoroughly mocked until speaking of them puts you in a Village) and the Focker films, which combines with Big Fat Greek Wedding to serve as the running gags (including the cat).\n\nIt is chaotic and sometimes seems to be going way off course, especially near the beginning, but it builds up to funnier scenes and everything ties in with the story, even if the continuity often fails.\n\nAs with the American Pie films that have made Alyson Hannigan's film career until now, this is gross-out comedy. Sometimes so gross-out that it's impossible to believe. But it's hard not to appreciate the mocking of mediocre pimp films and studio crap like Mr. & Mrs. Smith."

Alyson Hannigan lovely actress stick to good stuff, cant think of any you have done but try and steer away from the depths of hell your career is heading towards.

I actually liked the chemistry that the main couple in the movie had. I really liked them as single actors as well, The guy was cute and lovable and he was funny as well, and the girl was just really easy to like. Some of the gags were too crude and just kind of fell flat and it wasn't really a funny movie overall. I don't know I mean some scenes were actually kind of entertaining and a little bit amusing, but the scenes that weren't funny overpowered the scenes that were. I thought the comical orgasm scene from when Harry Met Sally was kind of clever, but other than that I mean the rest of the gags were just kind of worn. So that's why I'm giving this movie a five out of 10, I'm giving it a five for being better than other parody films I've seen, and because I liked the chemistry between the two main characters."

It's not as bad as people said it was. This is certainly not one of the worst films of the year. It's not as good as the Scary Movie series, but it is decent. There were some jokes that were laugh out loud and others that fell flat.\n\nYes, this is a stupid comedy. If you're one of those people who do not like stupid comedies, you will not like this movie. I'm one of the people who don't care if a comedy is stupid or not. I just watch comedies for the laughs and that's all. I'm very honest. This film is stupid but still, very sweet. Oh, when you look at Alyson Hannigan's face you'll feel in aw.\n\nThe acting was decent. Who cares? This film is not trying to win an Oscar, nor a Razzie. This film only tries to make the audience laugh and it does it. Some spoofs were funny, like Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Others were stupid, like Napoleon Dynamite. There is one joke to another. Some will make you laugh and some will make you think, \"Why did these people think this is funny?\" This film is good for many reasons. One is for Alyson Hannigan. She makes the film good. Another reason is that this is a new genre of spoofing. As to Airplane!, the characters don't act like they're funny, but in here, they try to act funny, which is kinda bad, if you ask me, but still, it's a new turn for spoof movies.\n\nIf you just like to watch a dumb comedy, go watch this movie. Shut off your brain and enjoy the movie. It might not be as bad as you thought it was. The jokes are funny and stupid. This is a decent film. Give this movie a chance."

I didn't make it all the way through the film, but I saw enough to know that there is nothing redeeming about it.\n\nA parody movie can be good if it has some originality and makes clever observations about the genre. Copying every scene from other films, with more exaggeration and grosser humour, does not make a good parody. Likewise, gross out humour in films can be funny (i.e American Pie, Bridesmaids, etc), but using it in every scene and overdoing it is not funny. It seemed that the writers were just trying to be as gross as possible, as that was the only was they could get a laugh. Overall, this movie took the movie references and grossness too far, and wasn't remotely clever or funny."

I went to see the movie on a hope that it was as good. I was extremely disappointed and the only reason I did not walk out of the theater is because Eddie Griffin was the only actor to bring a good comedic performance. Alyson Hannigan was just as good as she was in the American Pie series, which I'd consider annoying and not funny without funny actors supporting her scenes. It was also nice to see Fred Willard which proved his valuable comedic role as Ed Harkin in the movie Anchorman. There were a few known actors in this movie which were probably all overshadowed by the family pet. And my closing comment is this; Carmen Electra is still hot as ever."

The cast (whom i enjoy some, eddie griffin, alyson hannigan is alright, fred willard, josh meyers) were used so poorly, and the lead dude? Adam Campbell i think his name is was god awful.\n\nAnd whats with the 2 second dodgeball spoof? How was that spoofing a date movie? same with King Kong and Kill Bill. Sorry if that gave anything anyway, but it was in the trailer so i thought it was alright to mention.\n\nAt any rate, i don't really recommend this to anyway, the jokes are stale, and the ones that aren't stale are just plain awful, not funny in the least."

I did enjoy some of this movie, like the When Harry met Sally table scene but there is a lot going on in this movie that is so forced that you just cant bring yourself to laugh. I'm not saying this is a horrible movie, but it could have been better, I'm just not sure how. There are so many good spoof movies out there now that its hard to be original and Date Movie is far from original.

Still I cannot believe the amount of you criticize refusals towards the film, and is that according to IMDb: This catalogued like one for all time dates Movie from the 50 worse films. OK OK, is bad but not as much. Trying to copy many of popular romantic films not always brings a positive side, Dates Movie can make us laugh until the fatigue, but also it gets to feel to us disgusted by the exposed scenes. If, the script is of the worse thing, but this film is characterized in its good parts, by the corporal expression, Alyson Hannigan manages to establish a good balance in the terrible plot, doing to loosen to us one that another outburst of laughter. I go to him well the comedy to Aalyson, I like her performance like another one of the good scenes of the film when they do a scene to him to \"Meet The Fockers\" with the aid of Jennifer Coolidge. If single you want to happen pleasant awhile in the cinema, this is of the best options, I contradict to all those critical that squashed the film.

This movie has everything you could want in a spoof comedy, cheesy characters, mediocer dialogue and slapstick acting. From the My Big Fat Greek Wedding spoof to Pretty Woman, to My Best Friends Wedding, this movie had it all. The laughs just kept on coming and Alyson Hannigan was dead on in the title role. I recommend the Unrated edition if you are renting it. This movie certainly deserves a chance, was it better than Scary Movie? Well not the first one, but every subsequent after that."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie looked sort of intriguing in the commercials, kind of like a romantic \"Scary Movie\". However, it was nothing of the sort. Not only did it have no plot or character development, I got the feeling that this movie was created solely for the purpose of making fun of romantic comedies. There were countless parodies, but most of the time, they didn't fit the storyline (when there seemed to be one) and they just weren't funny. I almost left halfway through, but I thought it might be one of those movies that gets better after the first 20 or 30 minutes...unfortunately the movie was only about an hour long, and nothing got better. If you're in the mood for a romantic comedy, steer clear of this one."

        "review_detailed_main": "Apparently two of the writers from Scary Movie did the script. I can only guess their part in Scary Movie was checking the spelling on the end credits and typing lunch menus. This has to be the worst comedy released in years, zero out of ten would have been too generous. Part of me hopes that this film has lost something in it's journey over the Atlantic and that it may make someone laugh in North America. I'll give that continent some credit and I'm pretty sure that it won't.\n\nI don't remember laughing once throughout this (thankfully short) film. Date Movie is a new super-hybrid genre of comedy that must only amuse Hollywood Executives during their pitching meetings - like a dog whistle it's gags are totally inaudible to humans.\n\nIn short if you want to see something better than this, de-tune your TV and sit and watch static for 83 minutes."

The type of comedy being portrayed is one that being fat is unlovable, tell me more about you body hair is unsexy, and is ugly. I understand it's a comedy and it suppose to be satire or something but it just doesn't hit. The times have passed this movie like it was standing still. I love Alyson Hannigan, and she's the best part of this movie. I'm just so glad this isn't what comedy is in 2023 and we've moved past fatness being funny."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not sure if I should be writing this review now. After all, I didn't see all of Date Movie. After fifteen minutes, I was so bored, so disgusted, so annoyed, and so absolutely infuriated with this wretched piece of cat bile that I couldn't resist the urge to switch the DVD player off and go off to do something else.\n\nSome movies are dated immediately when they come out. For a while, I thought that this was only for decades past: the 50's, the 60's, 70', 80's, etc. This is one of the few movies I can safely say future generations will look upon and immediately shout \" 2006!\" Really! ' Milkshake', 'Pimp my Ride', 'Hitch', 'Napoleon Dynamite', 'The Bachelor', and so many more. ( So, so, so many more.....) This would be acceptable, if it managed to be funny. But this objective was apparently so alien to the writers, they seem to take great strides to avoid this goal.\n\nTake the beginning for incident: corpulent protagonist is in a park reciting nuptials to.....wait for it....Napoleon Dynamite. He cranes his head, scrunches his face, and utters, \" I won't marry you! Gosh!\" ( Something to that effect, it's been a while since I've seen the movie, and it sure didn't strike me as memorable.) I was sitting there, nodding my head. Indeed, I had seen Napoleon Dynamite, and that was sorta how he behaved. So what's funny about that? That's how Napoleon Dynamite behaves! There's no joke in there! I was waited for a little while for the punch line, but it never came! There are so many things 'parodied' in this mess that the plot seems to lose track over itself. In the Scary Movie series, it seems they would take several horror movies and focus on them primarily, ( In number 3 it was The Ring and Signs,) while all the others references were pretty much sidebars, nice little snippets that came and went. Not so in 'Date Movie'. I was assaulted with the darkest parts of modern pop culture in such a short span I got nauseous, fast.\n\nAll in all, avoid this catastrophe. Check out the 'Hot Shots!' series or 'Top Secret' to see what the parody genre is all about. Not in any way should this squalid fecal matter be associated with what is otherwise an extremely funny area of movies."

Humor many times is pretty stupid, and when you see someone reenacting a scene from a major movie, you even wonder about their creativity, but it's also a way to make fun of some blockbusters that everyone loves and no one dares to question. Therefore, Date Movie is for me a good comedy movie, of course is not getting an Oscar, maybe a Strawberry, but if you keep in your mind that you wanna forget stress and worries, and just let go, it's OK. However, if you can get someone else to pay the rent of the DVD, you will be saving a couple of dimes for sure."

I sat back into my chair preparing myself for complete boredom. The hopeless gags seemed to go on for eternity and I felt myself getting more and more p*ssed off. Thankfully about two thirds of the way through the film the screen projector broke so me and my friends took this as a perfect opportunity to leg it. I'm just glad that I didn't have to endure the rest of the film. There was nothing willing me to stay. I couldn't have cared LESS what happened at the end of this pathetic movie. I just feel sorry for the other thousands of people who had to sit through this torture and feel the need to tell others. There are already lots of comments saying how blatantly awful this film was.

Nobody's big-time, A-List famous here, but there are a number of familiar faces you'll recognize from other movies and TV shows (besides the lead, Alyson Hannigan).\n\nIt was genuinely painful to watch all these actors try so very hard to make this movie funny and involving when the writing and directing was just so bad, just so absolutely lame throughout, that there was nothing they could really do.\n\nYes, this film has about eight truly hilarious jokes in it -- but unfortunately, three of them come in the first fifteen minutes or so, and this movie is about ninety minutes long. The rest of the so-called jokes are just unbelievably weak, or simply not funny. Some of the jokes are actually pretty offensive -- but not in that South Park \"offensive but funny\" way.

This movie was hilarious in many different ways. I dunno, maybe people just didn't want to watch it because there was no violence. Yes the Scary Movie quadrilogy is very unique and amusing, but that doesn't mean you have to base your opinions of every other movie apon them. The style of this movie is very well done and smart for those of you who are interested in paying attention to the plot line, which isn't half bad for a romantic comedy. If you want to watch a good, funny movie then I suggest you watch this movie, it has a lot of parodies and is very enjoyable."

Turns out I had never actually watched it so I decided to boot it up, without knowing what the reviews were it for like. I was a fan of the Scary Movie films and must have bought this around the same time it was released but I have no memory of doing so. Either way, I thought this was decent fun. Nothing mind expanding obviously but the extremely high number of gags with one being uttered seemingly in every sentence means that plenty of them do hit. Was cool to see some well known actors in this and it has surprisingly high production values and looks the part.\n\nThe DVD itself contains its own anti-commentary, a neat feature I've never seen before. There's also some commentary tracks with the directors and the cast members. The extras ranged from pointless to entertaining, the 'romantic screensavers' just don't need to be there!\n\nYeah it's not that good but it's not horrible."

There are many of us who have sacrificed our time, brain cells, and a piece of our very souls to deliver this message. Please, stay away from this film. Let it be forgotten and never spoken of again.\n\nWith the success of Scary Movie comes this and Epic Movie... two more ideas which, given some time and attention, may have turned out OK. But this film seems like it was written by mentally challenged four-year-olds, using the wall and crayons instead of paper and pen.\n\nPlease, think of the children."

I really feel sorry for the actors in the movie though, because they all seemed to be trying to be good sports. There were so many things that just really ticked me off though, like a completely lame, completely pointless rip-off of a Blink -182 song (it was basically the same song, sans vocals and crappilly recorded). The main actress in particular seemed to be a really sweet woman with good taste, I don't know how she ended up in this movie though!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Be warned: this is just about the worst movie I have ever seen. Really. And I've seen thousands.\n\nHeather brought it home from the video store last night. I had grave misgivings, but I figured, \"Hey, Carmen Electra's in it, at least I can enjoy some quality T&A. And Alyson Hannigan is in the plus column, so... what the heck, maybe I'll even like it if I let go of my prejudice.\" I was so, horribly wrong.\n\nI consider spoof humor the lowest form of comedy; lower even than slapstick and fart jokes. And \"Date Movie\" is only spoof humor. Well, that's not true; there is some slapstick and a fart joke, too. But really, just because you recognize a scene as being lifted from another film, that does not automatically make it funny. You have to work a spoof a little more than that to get a laugh from me. Spoofing a genre is fine and can be funny; just recreating a scene from another film or quoting a line from a different, better movie is lazy.\n\nRarely (if ever) have I seen something so uninspired, so by the numbers. Back in the golden age of cinema, they used to call something a \"programmer\" if it was made to fit a particular genre and niche in the marketplace. At least most of those were made by professional, competent filmmakers. \"Date Movie\" isn't even that. It's just something to fill up the multiplexes between the last \"American Pie\" sequel and the next Tom Cruise picture.\n\n\"Date Movie\" is the worst thing any movie can be: boring. And at only an hour and thirteen minutes, that's no mean feat. Stay away from it. Please.\n\nOh, and Carmen Electra? She's in the final sixty seconds of the film getting fondled by King Kong. Har. Har. Har."

They tried to make parodies but it did not work, like \"The Lord Of The Rings\" parody they tried to pull off.\n\nThe actors and actresses were horrible. They had no acting talent.

Confusing itself with a spoof it's forced to string together its random and oh-so-apt gags with what is essentially a sincere romance storyline. So the essence of what this film is spoofing is exactly what it relies on to lifeboat the audience from one poorly executed reference to another.\n\nHow on Gods earth they thought they could spoof a comedy (Meet The Fockers) keeps me awake at night. I have actually witnessed better executed satire on \"The Amanda Show\" And even as a fellow Australian, if I'd seen Sophie Monk's leathery, malnourished form, greased up and clutching the worlds most unappetizing burger you would had to have pried the ready cocked gun from my mouth.\n\nOf course there are people who will think this movie is great and hilarious, however if you're over 14 my strong and forceful suggestion is; do not donate another cent toward this film. If you must, do so only so you can demand it back once the midget joke forces you from the theater."

I think a good rule of thumb to follow for future spoofs, aside from actually being funny, would be to not spoof comedies. Maybe it can work but it absolutely falls flat in this waste of film. The only good thing that came out of going to see this was when we walked out we snuck into Firewall which was just starting.
