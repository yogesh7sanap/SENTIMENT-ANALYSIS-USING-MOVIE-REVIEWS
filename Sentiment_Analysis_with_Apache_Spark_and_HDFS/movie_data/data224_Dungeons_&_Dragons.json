        "review_detailed_main": "RELEASED IN 2000 and directed by Courtney Solomon, \"Dungeons & Dragons\" chronicles events in the kingdom of Izmer where the idealistic Empress (Thora Birch) advocates equality between the mages and commoners while the power-mad Profion (Jeremy Irons) plots to overthrow the Empress with the help of his formidable henchman Damodar (Bruce Payne). A ragtag team is assembled to save Izmer by apprehending the Eye of the Dragon: Two thieves (Justin Whalin and Marlon Wayans), a beautiful mage apprentice (Zoe McLellan), a dwarf (Lee Arenberg) and an elf girl (Kristen Wilson).\n\nThe first shot with Irons hamming it up as the diabolical Profion made me bust out laughing. In other words, the movie telegraphs from the get-go that it's not to be taken seriously. If you can roll with the campiness, this is an amusing throwaway fantasy flick. Imagine the gaudiness of \"Star Wars\" (1977) if the story were transplanted to a Medieval-like kingdom where dragons & magic are reality and you'd have a good idea of what \"Dungeons & Dragons\" has to offer.\n\nThis was a theatrical release that cost a whopping $45 million, but totally bombed at the box office. The 2005 sequel \"Wrath of the Dragon God\" (with only Bruce Payne returning as Damodar) cost just $15 million and is slightly better because the creators took the material seriously, but it's decidedly TV fantasy fare.\n\nThe film scores pretty well on the female front with the winsome McLellan and cutie Birch. Whalin and Wayans are entertaining as the two main protagonists, if you can get past their goofiness. People love to hate Snails (Wayans), but I found him to be a likable, amusing character.\n\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 47 minutes and was shot in the Czech Republic (Kutn\u00e1 Hora and Prague). WRITERS: Topper Lilien and Carroll Cartwright.\n\nGRADE: C"

Even before I hit my teens I was writing better scripts for adventures then exist in this movie; there are so many plot holes the truck hasn't been built that's too big to drive through them, and despite having a cast of actors that aren't all that bad, the acting is in most cases similarly dreadful.\n\nSo, if you've ever played (A)D&D do yourself a favour and DON'T watch this movie, to avoid all the hair being ripped out of your skull whilst watching. If you've never played (A)D&D then STILL DON'T watch this movie - rent out Willow or Princess Bride or Ladyhawke or Lord of the Rings to get an idea about how good a campaign/adventure could be; watching this will just put you off ever playing the game."

It was litterally the most insulting, inane dialogue I have ever been treated to in a movie.\n\nProps arrive next in an extremely close second. The 35 Million dollars used to make this film must have been used on late night taco runs, because the quality of the props is abyssmal. The \"prized artifact\" of the movie looks like it fell out of a box of cracker jack, while some of the armor and backgrounds are straight out of the Bargain Bin at your local toy store. Better attempts at fantasy film making have been shot on camcorders across the globe in people's back yards.\n\nThe acting was terrible all around. The few, and I mean FEW, attempts at serious dialogue were crushed by the worst script ever. The only remotely cool character in the entire proceeding was Demadar, who was still pretty goofy. I guess if I was 8 or so, I might have thought he was creepy. The notably great actors in this film should have balked the moment they saw the script/quality of filming, and their presence on the screen only adds to the insult.\n\nTh producers of this movie should be ashamed of themselves. Hundreds of thousands of loyal D&D fans have been waiting for over 25 years for a great, inspiring movie from their hobby. D&D has a prodigious level of material written about it, and any one of it's 100+ books would have made a better movie if read aloud by Pee Wee Herman.\n\nThis horror show of a movie will no doubt ensure the demise of a great hobby in the public eye for at least the next 10 years. Any potential fan of the game will be unable to forget this awful movie experience. Consider yourself warned, and never, EVER see this movie."

Jeremy Irons was especially shocking, his performance was very pathetic and flat, as if this would be a bad movie for three year olds. That was not acting, that was a torment ! I cried every time he appeared on the screen.\n\nThora Birch was also far, far below her level in 'American Beauty', obviously unable to tell how one should put a little life into her bad dialogue and flat character, and somehow even thinking that that was her own fault.\n\nIf at all, the thief Snails (Marlon Wayans from Scary Movie) had quite some good moments in his slapstick scenes, the only good moments in the whole movie. Unfortunately they don't last long. Wayans seems to have a talent to shine even in the worst movies, however.\n\nThe performance of the main actor was also bad. His dull and cheap sunnyboy behavior really nerved me, and I saw absolutely no reason for his 'being special', but far more for 'being untalented'.\n\nThe effects where better than the story, but really not that exciting either.\n\nSome people say fantasy is about stereotypes, but that doesnt mean you can forget all rules how to make up a good story ! This story was not worth getting on the screen. This story was also not worth getting such good actors and effects. This story was nothing but crap !\n\nAnd I can't believe that Jeremy Irons and Thora Birch are such bad actors, they have proven they can do far, far better ! I can only guess it must have been the director who forced them to do such bad performances.\n\nDefinitely not recommended for anyone except maybe children below ten. Oh wait, they're not allowed ? No loss."

Now, I play D&D ( admit it, y'all do too ) so don't fault me for 'not understanding the genre'. The movie had too many characters, some of which disappear inexplicably during the course of the movie. The plot made no sense; the twists at the end came from nowhere.

The acting was especially shocking and horrific, Jeremy Irons's acting was very bad, from this film alone you'd think he was an amateur and had never made a good film in his life but the truth is, aside of this farce he's a great actor, which is why it was really shocking to see him camp it up as the way over the top villain. Anyone who praises this rubbish as a good film needs their head examined, and I personally thought even the plethora of cgi effects were pretty lame! The amount of other fantasy films it rips off is incredible, but The Lord of the Rings and Stars Wars seem particularly prevalent for the movie to plunder it's ideas from, and the resulting effect is merely a travesty of those classics."

I tried to keep watching in all honesty, but I kept on vomiting blood from its sheer awfulness.\n\nThe dwarf keeps disappearing, the orcs don't attack anyone, there is a big slow guy walking around wearing blue lipstick, Richard O'Brian is forced into a camp off with said blue lipstick wearing man, it was far too long (by too long, I mean it exists in our time and space), in one scene Jeremy Irons looks as though he is mounting the guy with the blue lipstick...why oh why oh why does this film exist?

I thought I had missed something but it turns out the makers of this movie missed a lot. They missed the D&D part, this movie only makes a mockery of the game and any plot imaginable. There is no acting, no plot. The very spirit of D&D is completely trashed. One of the worst parts is this Wayans guy who plays a Brooklyn rogue wannabe which is pointlessly killed in the middle of the movie. The characters are hardly believable (how stupid must the two rogues be) not to mention the entire action and party (\"Only you were meant to pass\"). A dwarf that barely has a role, a cute drow which also has no point in being there ... The movie barely adds up to 1 out of 10 and that's only because the dragon fight in the end is almost nice to watch."

Unfortunately, this is not only all the above, but also pretty tiresome & downright tedious as well.\n\nThe main unknown (to me anyway) leading threesome are all dreadful & from this showing awful actors as well. Justin Whalin is just laughable & one of the worst heroes in a long while. Probably since Val Kilmers appalling performance in The Saint. Zoe Mclellan is pretty enough (which probably explains away her deficiencies amongst other reviewers) but is still dreadful. The worse though is Marlon Wayons, whose performance is not only awful & completely unfunny, but also of a racist nature. The rest of the actors are also bad, but at least the likes of Jeremy Irons, Bruce Payne & Thora Birch, know they are only slumming it, & are at least decent actors if the material is there.\n\nThe plot is also weird & ridiculous, with no explanation of what is going on, & the upsetting thing was that the poor dragons couldn't have snacked on the lot of them, which would of at least made it a happy ending, for us & the dragons anyway. If you want to see a well acted & well made fantasy film watch Lord of the Rings instead."

The other performances ranged from the badly cast, Thora Birch whose other work has been superb, as the princess to the ridiculous, represented by the performance of Justin Whalin. The total lack of any character development (which for me was needed as the characters are different from the cartoon I used to love) and the shallow acting all meant that I couldn't have cared less what happened to the characters, let alone cling on to the paper thin plot. With all this though, I sat through the entire movie,waiting for the end and feeling sure that Rocky and Bullwinkle Must be better than this pile of toss, and that dude, is saying a LOT..."

This is a useless, clueless film from start to finish that has no idea of what it wants to be. It combines elements of a bad script, terrible acting, and average special effects to create a gloriously bad achievement. It's a would-be franchise that shot itself in the foot right out of the box. And if this is any indication of what future installments would have looked like, to that I say, \"Thank God.\"\n\nJeremy Irons plays the evil wizard Profion straight out of Overacting 101 - he's all sneers and shouts and waving hands. His lackey Damodar (Bruce Payne) is blue-lipped and black-armored (therefore evil) and exudes all the menace of an overripe eggplant. Thora Birch - wonderful in 'American Beauty' - looks like she was blackmailed into this role, as she's completely catatonic throughout the film, giving her Empress Savina (the wholesome representation of all things Good) zero energy and appeal.\n\nHow about those heroes? Marlon Wayans (Snails, the thief) is completely annoying, offering nothing to the proceedings; Justin Whalin (Ridley, another thief) - the nominal hero - is a goofball who'd be outclassed by the cast of Baywatch; and Zoe McLellan (Marina, the mage) is the only one who seems to even try to keep to a thematic element of fantasy, though she's in way over her head.\n\n'Dungeons & Dragons' is a complete mess and a complete waste of your time. If you want a fantasy film that draws upon the roleplaying game, try the one that D&D was based on in the first place: 'Lord of the Rings'. Keep this thing as far away from your television as possible."

But in this movie, most of the inherent magic of this fascinating world was simply let out for poor effects and cheap character stereotypes. The female mage has nothing to do but to look nice and to scream in moments of danger. She hardly ever uses her magic abilities, and therefore is a splendid example of the poor role play adaption this movie is. She is no mage - she is simply a damsel in distress.\n\nThe humor of the movie also is very simple and nothing to really laugh about. That is, if you leave out Jeremy Irons' incredibly bad acting - his bad mage routine should be added to acting books under the chapter \"how to overplay a character\". But, to be true, those were the most funny moments of the movie, so at least Irons was good for something here...\n\nAll in all a rather unspectacular start to the new wave of fantasy films which will accompany the giant blockbuster \"Lord of the Rings\" production. I pray to God that the Tolkien adaption will be far better than this mostly trashy b-movie."

It just seemed to be a bunch of movies that everyone was forced to like and if you didn't then there must be something wrong with you. Yes, they are much, much better made than the rather quaint D&D, but if you want a smaller, unassuming fantasy ride then don't completely rule this movie out.\n\nThe visual effects and production design of D&D are very similar to Paul Anderson's Mortal Kombat. Yes, it looks fake, but with just a little bit of suspension of disbelief you'll not even notice. I have a feeling that Courtney Solomon tried really hard to make it a good film but his talent doesn't extend as far as his enthusiasm.\n\nIn terms of character and story it is all pretty bland and generic. There's nothing in this movie that you haven't seen somewhere else. The actors do their best with the tepid dialogue and almost manage to not look embarrassed. The best thing about the film is it's surprisingly ferocious (maybe a bit too OTT) sound design. And the Dragon fight at the end was impressive for a medium budget film.\n\nI was actually surprised to find Joel Silver's name on the closing credits. I will assume that without him the film would have been a REAL stinker. And what's with that ending?\n\nEither way, I am still interested in the sequel."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sorry guys, I really didn't like this movie. I do think not only is it the worst fantasy movie I have ever seen, honestly Legend and Princess Bride were much better, but one of the worst movies ever made.\n\nThe dialogue was inane and vomit inducing. In one part of the movie Snails says something along the lines of \"That is the riddlyiest thing I have ever heard\". Not only was that unfunny, but entirely out of place. The direction was off too, and the scenery was okay, but the camera-work was so flat and unfocused, it was barely a redeeming quality. And the plot was poor too, likewise with the special effects and you could drive a big tube train in some of the holes in the action.\n\nAnd the acting was atrocious. Jeremy Irons is a great actor, participating in fantastic films like Lion King and Reversal of Fortune. But as the villain in possibly the worst performance of his career, not helped by the terrible dialogue he was given, he chews the scenery to pieces, honestly the dreadful overacting puts someone like Tim Curry to shame. Marlon Wayans was cringe worthy, his humour was lame and in some cases unnecessary, and Justin Whalin; bland beyond bland. Unbearably wooden at times, and as the hero? Tom Cruise did better in Legend and he was the main flaw of that movie. Just for the record, I do think Legend has its flaws, but it is gorgeous to look at, and Tim Curry's Darkness was phenomenal, and should've got an award. Thora Birch acquits herself better, but her dialogue was poor, and I was thinking, is she a little too young for the part?\n\nOverall, terrible. You may like it, and I have no problem if you do, but as a die hard fantasy fan, I hated it. Watch Legend, Princess Bride or NeverEnding Story instead. 1/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "Hard to say, was this movie aimed toward children? Anyway this is a rather disjointed and also disappointing adventure movie. The \"Dungeons & Dragons\" game serials showed some good potential for a full length movie but somehow they basically messed everything up.\n\nIt takes too long into the movie before it really starts to take pace and something really interesting occurs. On top of that the story feels messy. It introduces some plot lines in the beginning of the movie, that potentially seemed like good and interesting ones but then suddenly decided to abandon these plot lines for such a long time and starts to concentrate on the extremely formulaic and weak 'adventerous' story-line of the young and totally uninteresting characters. Only after more than halve way through the movie it decides to pick up the first introduced plot-line again, featuring the Thora Birch and Jeremy Irons character. It feels like two totally different and disconnected parts, so when the two of them start to mix it just doesn't work out.\n\nThe acting is just plain bad. You know, the sort of bad acting that becomes irritating after a while. This is especially the case with Zoe McLellan and Thora Birch. But of course also the weak and silly dialog doesn't help much. Perhaps it also has to do with the fact that director Courtney Solomon was still completely inexperienced at the time. And who's bright idea was it to cast Marlon Wayans? He feels totally out of place as the comical relief of the movie. And what a waste of the Jeremy Irons role. He perhaps has never played a more stereotypical generic evil movie villain but the movie he does it in is one of his worst. Bruce Payne also acts as if he thinks he is the new Darth Vader. Quite laughable.\n\nAmazing and surprising to see how much this movie tried to be like the Star Wars movies. Many of the characters show similarities, story elements are the same, some sequences are directly copied and really the list goes on and on but these are the three most obvious elements. It's so obvious that it becomes distracting and makes the movie terribly unoriginal to watch. Why did they do this? Wasn't the concept of \"Dungeons & Dragons\" already original enough on its own? By the way, the Star Wars movies weren't the only movies this movie uses its 'inspiration' from.\n\nThe movie really isn't bad looking with its sets and such, though some of the costumes were quite silly looking. It obviously wasn't a cheap movie to make. The special effects are just reasonable for its time but unfortunately the movie relies too hard on it and overuses it in parts, of course mostly notable in the final battle.\n\nThe movie has some extremely bad and silly sound effects. I also really hated the music. It seemed to be alway present and I just wanted it to stop! It was the formulaic type of music you would expect from a genre movie like this, only composed by a composer who will obviously never make it big time.\n\nYou're better off not watching it.\n\n3/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "Oh my. This movie was so phenomenally bad that I can't even think of an adjective negative enough to describe it. This is the kind of thing that \"straight to video\" couldn't have salvaged; that it actually had a theatrical release is staggering. I was expecting this \"film\" to be bad, but the true scope of its horribleness is beyond comprehension or anticipation. It is truly and magnificently wretched. Dungeons & Dragons makes _Conan the Destroyer_ seem like Hamlet in comparison.\n\nThe acting generally falls into two categories: mediocre actors who probably did the best they could with the material and normally good actors (Thora Birch, Jeremy Irons) who should be ashamed of themselves. Birch's dialogue is delivered woodenly as if she just wants the shoot to be over. As for Irons ((are those his real teeth?!? well, he is British)), his lines are spat out with such over-the-top absurdity it seemed he was exacting some sort of revenge on the producers. His snarling, rasping, phlegm-soaked performance left me thinking maybe he was blackmailed into doing this project. The only bright spots were the performance of Zoe McLellan as Marina and a very distinguished cameo by former Doctor Who maestro Tom Baker as Halvarth the Elf. Don't even get me started on the Marlon Wayans character -- I believe he single-handedly destroyed several generations' worth of progress defeating racial stereotyping in Hollywood. I hope he got a nasty letter from the NAACP.\n\nHammy dialogue atop a ridiculous storyline made for an unwatchable mess. The classic Dungeons & Dragons theme is the \"dungeon crawl\" hack-and-slay and a movie with this brand name to live up to should have capitalized on that. Instead we are treated to some convoluted plot about empresses and mage-councils and an oppressed population we never see.\n\nUnlike some of the other reviewers here, I found the sets, props, costuming, and effects to be adequate for a B-movie, and even good at times considering this is really a C- or D-movie. All those thematic elements are lost behind the atrocious script and acting, however.\n\nD'ya know how sometimes you want to experience something for yourself so you can decide on your own if it's as awful as people say? Don't do that with this movie. I promise that you'll spend the rest of your life trying to get those two hours back. It's not even worth downloading a pirated copy. If you must punish yourself somehow, try smashing your face into the wall a few times; ultimately that will be less painful."

I think it was meant to be a fun role-playing-inspired film. Nothing less, nothing more.\n\nI love the fact that everything that happens is classic and that every character is so un-original that it almost hurts.\n\nSomeone wrote in their comment something about that the elf and the dwarf had nothing to do in the movie, and they're WRONG! How could you ever try to gather a party to save the world without the dwarf and the elf, I just ask. Everyone knows that they MUST be in the group.\n\nAnother person wrote that he can't help but laugh at people who like this movie, and thats so darn sad.

I still have a soft spot for Justin Whalin after New Adventures of Superman.\n\nSpecial effects are pretty risible in comparison with the Lord of the Rings movies.\n\nScript and dialogue are poor and the plotting is loose at best.

        "review_detailed_main": "I can only think of two times when I ever walked out on a movie because they were so bad: Hobgoblins (1987) and the sickening Dungeons & Dragons. I was horrified not only as an unfortunate viewer of this movie, but also as a seasoned gamer of Dungeons & Dragons myself.\n\nThe special effects were so blatantly fake it was sad. Some of the special effects looked like they were borrowed from a Playstation. I would have laughed had they not been so bad. Half of the beginning was needlessly panning around those sad excuses of computer animated buildings. Was there any apparent reason for that besides \"computer animation is nifty\"?\n\nThe acting was terrible from all fronts. I was most disappointed with Jeremy Irons who has done much better in movies such as The Mission (1986). However, as Profion he seemed more like the Phantom of Krankor, the villain from Prince Of Space (1959). The only reason he came off as a bad guy was because he snarled and had shifty eyes. And why is it that neither of the two main villains can talk right? Profion speaks with that annoying lisp and shouts out every other word. That prevents any sort of coherence at all. Bruce Payne (as Profion's bald, lipstick-wearing, transexual sidekick Damodar) talks like a sad Shatner wannabe. He appears to be evil because he speaks haltingly throughout the movie. Let me also say that Justin Whalin (Ridley Freeborn) and Marlon Wayans (Snails) make the two worst heroes I have ever seen. You can tell Snails is a good guy because he acts like a naive, smiley ferret with a sugar high.\n\nThe writing was awful as well. The dialogue seemed so forced and unnatural. Especially the game-related humor, which was much too blatant. It seemed like the writers were thinking, \"Okay how can we put in as many cheesy, pointless jokes as possible?\" It seemed that their vision of the game-related humor was just to mention some of the terms. Here is an example of what they might consider funny dialogue: \"I'm going to cast HOLD PERSON on you!\" \"You can't cast HOLD PERSON on me! You're a mere LEVEL ONE mage!\" \"I'm casting HOLD PERSON now!\" casts the spell \"You cast HOLD PERSON! Oh no! Well at least you didn't cast MAGIC MISSILE!\" I'm not even gonna go into the over used amounts of exposition, the extreme number of unpronounceable fantasy names, and the repetitiveness of it all.\n\nThe saddest part was that it took ten years to make this movie. TEN YEARS and it ended up as this rotting pile of filth. You could get a higher quality story by taking a group of teenage Dungeons & Dragons nerds and watch them beat the snot out of goblins and ogres for 3 hours. In summary, this movie was amazingly disappointing. One out of ten because IMDB doesn't have any numbers between zero and one for voting."

People said this movie was at least \"fun\" but I hardly even found it to be that. I can enjoy a bad movie as long as it's entertaining, but D&D managed to be bad and unentertaining. The FX were mediocre, and the ending (having much potential for a cool Mage Vs. Dragons scene) was wasted. I thought Jeremy Irons was at least a little fun to watch, only because he looked like he realized what kind of movie he was in, and decided \"act along\" as to mock the rest of the movie. Scenes of spinning scenery kept appearing reminding me very much of the Mortal Kombat movies (but probably had more than both of those combined). This movie had very much potential to bring back the medieval fantasy genre, but it looks like we have to wait for Lord of the Rings. MST3000 material. 2/10"

To do this, he needs either the royal scepter or Rod of Savrill. It has the ability to control dragons. Unfortunately for him, the empress of Istar holds the former. Therefore, he sends his chief warrior, Damodar, after the Rod of Savrill while lying to the Council of mages, of which he is a member, about how the teenage empress is too young, and therefore, too inexperienced to be empress. The empress is aware of this, and sends her best tracker, the elf Norda after the Rod. Meanwhile, the empress' status is in jeopardy due to the Council believing the lies of Profion. And on top of that, two thieves, Ridley and Snails, a young mage, Marina, and a dwarf fighter, Elwood, are unwittingly involved in this.\n\nWhen you think about it, this storyline is actually pretty good. There's political intrigue to be found, something we don't see that often on the big screen. And although I didn't mention it earlier, we have a plot point that is the non-mages not getting many rights. This is definitely a better plot than I would've expected.\n\nAll is not well in the plot, however. Too much is clearly stolen from other movies. The \"Star Wars\" knock-offs are too numerous to mention. Also, the series of traps we see Ridley go through at one point clearly rip off the \"Indiana Jones\" series. I can live with this somewhat, but it does detract from the movie nonetheless.\n\nThe character development is fairly good. Ridley begins the movie as a typical thief. However, we later find that he has an apparently cynical past due to his hatred of the mages. Although he loses points due to how hard it is to not compare him to Luke Skywalker from \"Star Wars\" fame. Profion is pretty much how we would all expect an evil wizard to be. Hungry for power, hungry for land, hungry for slaves, and unwilling to stop at anything to get them. Most of the other characters don't get much room to breath, but when they do, we see a lot of personality from them. Except for Elwood. He doesn't get much to do. Although with the long cast, that's expected. We also see something of a psudo-romance between Snails and Norda. Snails is trying to put the moves on Norda. Whether she is returning or spitting on his advances is open to debate.\n\nThe One bad thing about the movie is that the last 20 or 30 minutes seem rushed. Ridley is transported to Profion's castle via a magic portal used by Damodar, gold dragons are suddenly attacking Profion, and Ridley's friends are joining the battle, even though we would have assumed they were a few states away 8 minutes ago. And after Profion is killed, we find that the empress has given mages and normals equal rights. Huh? That's the sign that they were running out of money/time to make the movie.\n\nDespite this crippling flaw, \"Dungeons and Dragons\" is well worth watching. I know I enjoy it. Especially on my DVD copy. And for those of you who felt a need to give this movie a 1, let me present you with two fantasy movies: \"Conan the Barbarian\" and \"Hercules in New York.\" If D&D is a 1, what the hell are those two stinkers?"

Maybe it made sense to those who are familiar with the RPG, but to the uninitiated, it is never explained why any of the people do what they do. But on to the real horror.\n\nIt has been quite a while that I have been so severely shocked by acting this bad. It's not even an individual achievement, oh no, it is a collective effort of the entire cast (except the dragons, maybe). On the face of Thora Birch, whom I admire for her work in American Beauty, I registered a total of two different expressions throughout the film. Her impact was such that she might just as well not have been there.\n\nJustin Whalin earned himself the number one position in my list of Worst Actors of All Times, beating even Chris O'Donnell to that position, and it should be said that this is the first time I ever saw him. Talk about a first impression. I cannot even put an adjective to his acting, as most of the time I found myself staring at the guy in shock. His presence must have rubbed off on Jeremy Irons, who really has no excuse for his participation in this disaster.\n\nWas he trying to have his last name changed to \"Irony\"? Unless he was being so ridiculously over the top on purpose, I cannot imagine what must have possessed him to act the way he did. Even the villains in the 60's Batman show were more subtle in their facial expression!\n\nThe film gets one point for its dragons, though. Nice fire-breathing, fine acting ability despite the horrible script (they really had no lines, did they), and charming demonstrations of athletic prowess.\n\nBy the way, if anyone would care to enlighten me as to what happened to the \"heroes\" in the graveyard in the end (things like this always end on graveyards), feel free. I really didn't get it. Which, of course, only deepens my resentment at having squandered two hours of my life on this abomination."

I couldn't look at literally anything else. At first I thought it was just a weird reflection but no he had someone put metallic blue lipstick on him. No one even mentions it. Not once. There is no indication something is slightly different about him, so I'm guessing he has always put on metallic blue lipstick.\n\nIt confounds me. I am utterly transfixed and bewilered as to why this decision was made. Everyday they sat in hair and makeup and thought let's put on a metallic blue lipstick on this bald guy. And no one objected?\n\nI'm telling you I looked at his blue lips only. All I thought was about them. When he's being cursed or whatever and those weird things are coming out of his ears, I literally was still looking at his lips. What brand did they even find a shade like that in? It didn't smudge or nothing with him battling.\n\nLike you're telling me this was a decision they made, like it came into thier heads and they never reconsidered. It was never explained in the script, like was it because he had evil powers? Like his lips are poison???? What?\n\nIn the battle scene, there is tons of CGI so I guess because of shading his lips look a little less blue but the lipstick was clearly not CGI they physically applied it on his lips. Everyday they made that choice.\n\nI honestly was just wondering about this the whole movie. It's the only reason to watch this film."

I saw it because I'm trying to see the worst films ever made and want to add it to my ever-growing list of terrible cinema I've reviewed. But is it really Bottom 100 terrible?\n\nProfion (Jeremy Irons...who is doing some amazing over-acting here) is a baddie and likes doing bad things. I'm not sure why. Anyway, he's out to topple the Empress and make himself the Emperor...and with all his powers and snarling badness, he seems likely to do it. To stop him is an inexperienced Mage and two idiots. I say 'idiots' because they are there only for comic relief and seem as if they stepped onto the set from another film. In other words, they and their 'antics' just don't seem to make much sense and they are anachronistic to say the least. They are so annoying that I found myself rooting for Profion...just so he'd kill them!\n\nThe film's biggest deficit is the writing...which is very poor. A few other problmes are unlikable characters and some very dated CGI. A few of the CGI effects are good for 2000, but many times you can't help but think they should have used practical effects because the CGI just looks so fake. Another HUGE problem is that the script doesn't seem to know if it's supposed to be a serious drama or a comedy. Making it just one or the other would have been a big improvement. As it is, it just comes off as annoying.\n\nOverall, the film is bad...but I must say that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of worse films. I really don't think it should be on the Bottom 100. Bottom 500 (if they had one), definitely."

This comes from the same studio who would ironically produce the greatest fantasy trilogy of all time and the contrast is baffling. The performances range from dull to over the top bad. There is also an abrupt shift to the climax and from that point, it's like the writers just didn't care anymore and, from an entertainment stand point, it was glorious. In fact, this whole movie is fascinating in its own way. This is a huge guilty pleasure and what would have made it even more so would be some more screen time from Jeremy Irons.

I saw it during its theatrical run and laughed so hard that I literally started crying at one point; so when it ended up on DVD, I had to own it.

Well, for one thing, I don't have any emotional stock in \"D&D.\" It's a terrible movie with two-dimensional characters, bad writing, horrible direction, and so many cliches that if you tried making it into a drinking game you'd surely die of alcohol poisoning. It's never more than it appears to be: a potato chip movie. Sure, it'll rot the brain--but only if you take it seriously (which, I'm afraid, the creative forces behind it did, much to their undoing).\n\n\"Star Wars,\" however, DOES mean something to me...So when I see one of THOSE films and find it's riddled with two-dimensional characters, bad writing, horrible direction and a multitude of cliches, I have to wonder whether or not we even need \"Spaceballs\" anymore. Anyway, I expect more of Mr. Lucas...but NOT of Courtney Solomon.\n\nSolomon and his screenwriters sought to create a trilogy here to cash in on the \"Star Wars\" phenomenon, and because the anticipation for the first installment of LOTR was growing, a fantasy setting seemed an obvious choice. However, the allusions to LOTR are slight (probably because it had yet to roll off the block); but it's a near-perfect copy of Episode I with a few OT moments thrown in. Obviously, after the success of \"Phantom Menace,\" it seemed an easy tomb to rob. The only thing that surprises me is how few critics (or fanboys) have mentioned it.\n\n**************************************************\n\n1)THE OPENING TEXT CRAWL\n\nAnytime a fantasy/sci-fi movie opens with either a text or voice reading that \"sets the stage,\" we're reminded of \"Star Wars,\" which did it perfectly and without the pretentiousness that its imitators embraced. In \"D&D,\" Bruce Payne supplies the narrative. It's \"Star Wars\" in every way, right down to the way the last sentence trails off (\"But the evil mage Profion has other plans....).\n\n2)THE YOUNG QUEEN\n\nNow, I don't understand why I was the only one with a problem with the concept of Queen Amidala. First of all, in a monarchy, you don't ELECT a queen; and secondly, if you do, you vote for the candidate who ISN\"T thirteen years old. Seriously, how do you LOSE an election like that...?\n\n\"D&D\" aped this completely. She's young. She's idealistic. She's wooden. She wears god-awful dresses and gaudy head-pieces. Hell, if you want to get REALLY nit-picky about it, you could say that Solomon cast Thora Birch because of the strategically-placed moles on her face that suggest Amidala's \"red dot\" thing.\n\n3)THE OLDER, TRUSTED ADVISOR WHO'S GONE BAD\n\nInstead of Palpatine, we're treated to Profion, the worst role Jeremy Irons ever took (and his equally worst performance). Behind the scenes, Profion is plotting to overthrow the queen (referred to as \"the empress\" so as not to seem too blatant a rip-off), and is sowing seeds of discord within the council (senate) in order to overthrow her rule. His dirty work, however, is saved for his chief lieutenant...\n\n4)THE DARK WARRIOR\n\nBruce Payne's character, Damodar, is equal parts Darth Vader and Darth Maul. He's a towering, sadistic, black-clad, slow-moving and unbelievably strong armour-clad warrior (Vader) who also happens to be bald-headed and painted with stupid-ass make-up (Maul, who didn't look stupid-ass at all). If this wasn't enough, listen for the thinly disguised echo of \"The Imperial March\" when he first appears at the magic school.\n\n5)LUKE/HAN\n\nIn Ridley, we have a combination of the Luke and Han characters. He's a scoundrel who cares nothing for the \"greater good,\" but in the end, is willing to turn aside from his love of money (he rejects a pile of easily obtainable gold) in favour of saving the kingdom from the evil Profion. Also we learn that he has latent magical abilities, stemming from his father (this was to be expanded upon in the sequels, when Damodar tells Ridley, \"No--I am your father!\").\n\n6)JAR-JAR REDUX\n\nMarlon Wayans. Good God, could the allusion be any more transparent. Let's see: he's a tall, gangly African-American stereotype spouting catch-phrases, bungling his way in and out of trouble, and generally getting on our *beep* nerves with his not-so-fun humour. Hell, he even has a hat that resembles a pair of goofy, Gungan-like ears. The only satisfaction is that he dies painfully.\n\n7)THE SCOUNDREL AND THE GOOD GIRL\n\nLike Leia and Han before them, Ridley and Marina come from two different worlds: he's an opportunistic creep and she's a member of the aristocrisy. At first they bitch at each other to work out the sexual tension; but in the end, fall in love, much to our great surprise.\n\n8)THE MIND RAPE\n\nRemember when Vader interrogated Leia, using the mind probe to extract the necessary information? In this movie, he uses a pair of penises that live in his ears.\n\n9)LET'S SAVE THE GIRL FROM THE IMPENETRABLE FORTRESS!\n\nHey--it's the only way to steal back the much-sought-after \"plans,\" right? And while we're there, let's have a main character die, allowing for our hero to scream \"NOOOOO!\" (while Milking A Giant Cow, no less).\n\n10)CITIES IN TREES\n\nAt least the elf cities in LOTR looked elegant. The one here looks shockingly similar to the Ewok village.\n\n11)THE SWORDFIGHT\n\nWhen Ridley and Damodar have their duel, the clash of their blades creates a lightning effect, rendering the bad guy's sabre red and the good guy's sabre blue. Damodar is finally defeated after Ridley does a leap, sucker-slashes his foe in the midsection, who then falls over a steep drop. It all seemed vaguely familiar...\n\n12)RESISTING THE DARK SIDE\n\nRidley is momentarily seduced by dark magic during the climax; but only by turning aside and embracing the light can he persevere. \"No! I won't become...YOU!\"\n\n13)BORING POLITICS AND BAD CGI.\n\nCome on: you know it's true.\n\n14)SPLIT-SECOND ESCAPE CHOICES\n\nWhen reaching a dead-end while pursued by baddies, our heroes take the smelliest possible escape route: through the sewers. To reach this destination, they must dive head-first down a chute where they land in a pool of cr@p (not unlike the Death Star trash compactor, or all of \"Attack of the Clones\").\n\n15)OTHER BLATANT RIP-OFFS\n\nNeed I mention how Ridley keeps grinning and saying, \"Trust me?\" Or how he goes through the Thieves' Maze, a series of \"riddles\" straight out of all three \"Indiana Jones\" movies? Or about the scene where Marina, belly-down on the floor, is grasping for the scroll, which during the fight, is getting kicked around like a certain diamond in \"The Temple of Doom?\" Or how Ridley is stabbed in the shoulder and can be healed only by the King of the Elves? Or that scene where.....\n\nYou get the point. Watch this movie. Watch it RIGHT NOW. It might be a hodgepodge of rehashed ideas, but it's ten times more entertaining than these new \"Star Wars\" movies.\n\nBy the way: a sequel has been officially greenlit."

The whole thing centres around his megalomaniacal desire to depose the Empress (a shockingly wooden Thora Birch) and seize her sceptre that controls the white dragons. She's having none of that, so he must now seek out the red \"Rod of Savina\" via his menacing henchman \"Damodar\" (Bruce Payne) for that controls the red ones. Meantime petty thieves \"Ridley\" (Justin Whalin) and his pal \"Snails\" (Marlon Wayans) manage to get embroiled in the plot after a visit to the House of Magic goes a bit awry. The scene is now set for some silly, set-piece escapades with some basic special effects, a daft cameo from Richard O'Brien (reappraising his \"Adventure Game\" performance) and, well you get the drift. It's poor, this - but I didn't hate it. There is a bit of fun being had, Whalin is easy enough on the eye and the whole thing has it's tongue so firmly planted in it's cheek that it is hard to actually dislike it - especially at the end when Iron hits super-ham mode and the dragons all take flight. Sure, the dialogue is daft but somehow that just didn't matter. Despite myself, I quite enjoyed this...."

        "review_detailed_main": "The D&D universe is one of epic battles, great heroes and very nasty villains. Did this movie deliver any of this, well apart from the last 10-15 mins....NO...not in any way. I knew it was not going to live up to my expectations or even mildy amuse me, when they introduced the \"Comedy Sidekick\" Snails. If you ask me Ridley should have run him through when he didn't want to go along with his plan in the first 5 mins of the film, but you can't have everything. Why does almost every film with great potential need to be ruined by the inclusion of some muppet, who is used to make the weakly cast and developed main characters look good.\n\nOverall, I was very very disappointed with this film, they had the potential to produce something great, and they fluffed it BIG TIME. I wasn't asking for a film so painfully accurate to the D&D universe that you could see people rolling dice during battles, but I was expecting something epic and engaging...and it seems that they didn't even try to achieve that in this film. All I found myself wishing for, was a grisly end for all of the main characters, be they good or evil.\n\nHowever, IF you've never played D&D or ever read any of the books, AND you like comedy sidekicks then you'll probably think this is an excellent film. However if you are a D&Dphile, my advice would be to aviod this film like the plague."

(Probably because it was all action and no acting, which was diabolical) You can almost hear him shout 'I can see the Crystal!'. It was worth 100 minutes of tripe for that.\n\nThe effects are very good, and the locations are excellent, but it is really let down by the script and chronic overacting. However, as you can't really escape from the former except by muting the film, accept it and just sit back and laugh at the overacting instead. In fact, turn the sound off and dub it yourself, your script could be no worse.\n\nGet some beers in, phone all your friends who like Conan the Barbarian or Hawk the Slayer and don't expect too much. You'll have a great night.\n\nHowever, if you want a really good fantasy movie, rent Lord of the Rings, Labyrinth or The Wizard of Oz."

In fact, his character, I thought, is what held my interest in the film. He did seem to over act in a few scenes but it did not seem to detract from the film. The hero of the film seemed to lack depth and did not seem to inspire much. This film could have been better if they had casted a different person to play the hero. I have to admit, for anyone who likes the game of \"D & D\", you will mostly likely like this one. I felt this film has many good traits and scenes, it just needed a better presentation to make it come together. If you like \"D & D\", or mysticism that surrounded the medieval times, you will like this one. If you don't, you will hate this one.\n\nOverall, okay but nothing special (5 out of 10)."

It\u00b4s pretty much the same as with Episode 1, I was really happy to see a lightsaber being used as a cutting tool instead of a weapon, because we used to do just that often when playing the Star Wars RPG. Episode 1 was bad, though, having so many ugly flaws like the speeder race or this supposed-to-be-funny character whose name I don\u00b4t wanna write down.

Besides, it's not very close to D&D rules.. eg. the mage needed some kind of powder to cast magic, and she's mostly wimpy and useless.. in \"reality\" :) the mage would have kicked some butt, but no, being a girl she's weak and needs a lousy thief to rescue her.

I also liked the troll guy. He was cool. The skeleton guy kind of creeped me out the first time I saw this, but after he was talking for a while, I got used to it. I am really used to it now. If you liked this film, I suggest you see Harry Potter and the Socerer's Stone and Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring."

        "review_detailed_main": "This should not have been a difficult movie to make based on the budget had for the talent they were able to put together; the production quality of the props, costume, and makeup; and even the flimsy CGI. All they had to do was put together a simple, typical adventuring quest consisting of a fighter, cleric, wizard, rogue, and barbarian of varying races and have them complete a fun dungeon crawl... maybe sink some of the big budget dollars into a quality CGI dragon or BBG at the very end. Everything else would just have to be practical.\n\nInstead, we got some big political story arch involving a council of mages versus a princess/mage(?) which uses a pair of young thieves and a young wizard traipsing through a uninteresting world on an directionless quest to obtain a McGuffin. Yeah, some other characters show up but they are absolutely pointless to the plot. I knew the story was terrible the minute they made it about the inequality of mages and commoners or some nonsense. Just uninspiring and boring.\n\nIt's sad that Jeremey Irons starred in this after such big hits in the 90's. He makes an utter fool of himself in this though. In fact, all of the actors look like buffoons throughout, especially Marlon Wayans playing the dopey sidekick. Bruce Payne really gives it all he has too in delivering some Grade-A garbage dialogue throughout most of the film. The CGI dragons are so bad that it made some of the monsters in the Kevin Sorbo television series, which came out prior to this, look like Lord of the Rings in comparison.\n\nAll in all, whoever is as responsible for this fairly big budget disaster should be thrown in the dungeon and fed to the gelatinous cube for an eternity."

However, this movie does not do it justice.\n\nFirst, I've seen better acting in most high school drama pieces.\n\nSecond, there were a handful of supporting cast characters that added absolutely no value to the movie.\n\nFinally, relationships between the characters were so poorly defined that the viewer really did not care less about any of them."

In short, the music saves this movie.\n\nAs for it's plot elements being compared to George Lucas's Star Wars, George Lucas stole most of his stock characters and plot elements from Westerns and Arthurian legends long ago, and he doesn't own them just because his franchise is so famous."

        "review_detailed_main": "Did you see the size of that Dwarf? This much anticipated movie of 2000, titled as the very popular role-playing game, should do much to further the question of \"What were they thinking?\" A great deal of the movie is spend in grandiose costume and CG sets with the actors, primarily one Jeremy Irons, as Profion an evil wizard, over acting in the most laughable manner. Which is odd because Jeremy Irons has never really done anything remotely laughable.\n\nIrons had company in the theatre of the absurd acting style and that was with back up villain played by Bruce Payne as, Damodar in blue lipstick and shaved pate, delivering lines like a macho Tim-Frankenfurter-Curry.\n\nAnd that is what is at odds with some of the primary components of this movie. I'm sure they did not want the villains to be completely laughable because they would have wanted them to generate enough fear or dread from the audience so they would be concerned for the welfare of the goods guys.\n\nThen you have the good guys, Justin Whalin as Ridley and Marlon Wayans as Snails, who are suppose to have the kind of lighted hearted swashbuckling, devil-may-care, attitude which has been a foregone clich\u00e9' in the forms of Han Solo and Indiana Jones. However in D&D the lead character, Ridley, was more like a generic Starbuck from the TV series Battlestar Galactica. Marlon Wayans as the reluctant Snails had lines that were suppose to be comic relief but were flat and lackluster.\n\nI do want to say that I am a huge fan of the Sword and Sorcery genre. I have read many of the great books from Robert Jordan, \"The Wheel of Time\" series, Terry Brooks the \"Shannara\" series, and as well as the first three Dragon Lance novels by Margaret Weiss and Tracy Hickman. I really enjoyed those books. So don't get me wrong I do love the genre and I know what it takes to make a good Sword and Sorcery story, yet I was expecting more out of this movie.\n\nThe character of the Empress Savina, played by Thora Birch was so visually reminiscent of Queen Amidala from the Phantom Menace that I could not help but be reminded of Amidala every time Birch was on the screen in those over the top costumes.\n\nThe story to D&D is real predictable. You know the standard, \"OH my God the Princess, Empress-whatever- is in trouble and the evil mean guy is going to ruin everything for her and that will be terrible because she is so nice and concerned about her people-and she's a hot looking unit to boot- so we have to get some reluctant swashbucklers to go through a whole bunch of cool exciting stuff and find a magical thing that will make everything better just in the nick of time before evil mean guy can make the Princess or I mean the Empress lose everything and cry her pretty Hollywood mascara saturated eyes out.\n\nThere is a scene in this movie where the character Ridley has to navigate a maze to obtain an important component in finding the magical \"thing\" to help the Princess err I mean the Empress. This was like a cross from \"Return of the Jedi\" and all The \"Indiana Jones\" flicks combined. I couldn't believe there wasn't one original pitfall in the whole thing.\n\nYou know I always thought Dragons were supposed to be formidable and intelligent. At least in all the books I read they were. Remember George Lucas's early eighties production of \"Dragon Slayer\"? That dragon for its time was awesome and fearsome. The Dragons in this movie were so blatantly computer generated that there wasn't anything remotely sentient or frightening about them. I don't know if they want people to think that in the world of Dungeons and Dragons the Dragons look cool as unapologetically CG creations? The grand finale battle scenes were disturbing in that I kept thinking, \"What are those X-wing fighters flying around out there?\" You see there were so many dragons flying around and spraying fire out causing other dragons to go crashing to earth like jets or X-wing fighters in a dogfight. It was very distracting, as it had no look of realism. It just didn't feel like a movie that took place in the time of Dungeons and Dragons.\n\nBy the way did you see the size of that Dwarf?"

Although I never played the RPG, I used to be - and still am - an avid fan of the adventure gamebooks that you play with a couple of dice. So this is just the sort of film that should appeal.\n\nUnfortunately it turns out to be an absolutely appalling travesty of a movie and one of the worst ever made. Gone is any attempt to make a movie on a serious level. Instead, we have a semi-comic fantasy that contains a few recognisable elements from the genre - including a badly-animated CGI dragon - but feels like a student play in all other respects.\n\nEverything is bad about this film, and I mean EVERYTHING: the writing is horrible, the direction sub-par, the characterisation is nil, the costumes are eye-wateringly ridiculous and the special effects are anything but. Literally the only enjoyment I got from the whole thing were the cameos from Tom Baker and Richard O'Brien, two British cult favourites.\n\nActually, I lie; I did get some fun from trying to figure out who the worst actor was on-screen. It's not Bruce Payne, whose B-movie villain duties come in handy, nor is it Jeremy Irons, who delivers a pantomime performance reminiscent of Alan Rickman's in ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES. It's not Marlon Wayans in another lame comedy relief part, nor is it Justin Whalin, as wooden as he is. No, it's a toss-up between Kristen Wilson, who's really bad as the elf, and Thora Birch as some kind of princess. In the end, Birch wins out; her acting really is that terrible. It's cringeworthy and embarrassing every time a sentence comes out of her mouth.\n\nThankfully, I'd seen the even cheaper DUNGEONS & DRAGONS: WRATH OF THE DRAGON GOD, so I had some idea of the level of sheer awfulness I was about to witness. But forget going in to this and having a good time; it's not even so-bad-it's-good, it's just so-bad-it's-bad."

The dragons looked like characters from a Disney cartoon. Judging from the ongoing comic relief and the clich\u00e9 lines (I was able to recite many of them before the actors spoke them) it became evident that this was a movie made for a 7-year olds birthday party. The props which were supposed to carry earth-shattering importance looked plastic. The enunciation of dramatic lines was enough to make you cry or laugh out loud. I wanted to turn this off at so many points...let's just say that this is a movie that will insult the intelligence and the artistic sensibilities of anyone over 10 years old. Why did I rent this?

I almost feel as if the producers/writers had no consideration for what is appealing about the role-playing game. As a person who played the game (if... 25 years ago), I have a good sense of why it was (and is) successful. None of this comes through in the movie. From the perspective of a player, I have to say that this is a slap in the face.\n\nThird: I tried to imagine how a non-player might approach this movie. I even considered seeing it as a campy, B-movie sort of experience (and, mind you, I have a weird affection for decent B-movies). But there's something sickly and ill-informed about this production; all of the sets appear to have been constructed from styrofoam blocks, and the digital \"effects\" evaporate before you can touch them. At one point, it seems to want to be Queen's \"Flash Gordon\" but can't even pull this off. You can spot a moment when Jeremy Irons has given up, and tries to pretend that it's all a joke. Too late, buddy.\n\nFourth: Oh, don't let us even start to discuss the gender/racial stereotyping in this movie. It's another slap in the face of... all of us.\n\nIn summary: Listen, I'm a real fantasy/sci-fi nerd, okay? So I'm always looking for some good material, and when I heard about \"Legend of the Seeker\" coming to TV, I was SO, so excited. Alas, that show is all crap and makes me want to shed my nerdy credentials! That said, \"Dungeons and Dragons\" makes that show look like genius. Please don't see this picture. It takes a big, fat dump on a whole genre."

The movie captured d&d (and this is from a past player and someone who enjoyed the game) so well, the dorkiness, nerdiness and geekyness the absolute feeling of a gaming session and brought it straight to the big screen, anyone who disagrees takes the game way to seriously. Now that being said it should be noted that if the movie had had any other title it would have been the most horrible fantasy movie ever made, and if you watch the genre then you know that this is a terrible, very terrible thing to be said of any movie.

The acting is laughable (even the otherwise talented Thora Birch manages to take a plunge), the special effects are pathetic, the story is a mess, the directing is abominable... I stated above that there are only two redeeming features here. And they are Jeremy Irons and Bruce Payne. I like Jeremy Irons, at his best he is an excellent actor. And say what you will, but he always TRIES to lift even crap like this to decent levels. All his effort was for naught though, but still he tried and that is worth something. Bruce Payne on the other hand is his usual over-acting self, and offers the only laughs available.\n\nThis movie clocks in at 107 minutes, but it feels like five hours. This is a crap-marathon that offers virtually nothing in the way of entertainment. How this movie could be made is beyond me. And i actually remember some HYPE about it before it came out.

        "review_detailed_main": "Before watching \"Dungeons & Dragons\", I didn't have high expectations. So I figured maybe it would be better if I didn't expect much. It turns out that \"Dungeons\" was worse than I had originally anticipated. I can't believe that any film studio would pay money to have this piece of crap made, even if it's a $35 million budget.\n\nI'll start out with the mentally retarded characters: We have the two hero characters, Ridley Freeborn (Justin Whalin) and his sidekick Snails (Marlon Wayans), the villain Profion (Jeremy Irons) and his aide, Damodar (Bruce Payne), whose attire seems little more than a Halloween costume bought at Kmart (I'd bet this was Kmart's last sale), and simple makeup consisting of blue lipstick that has virtually no difference to the stuff kids wear at school these days -- some of the characters' costumes resemble trench coats, as well. In addition, we have Thora Birch as the Empress, who is a complete cliche of \"Star Wars\"'s Queen Amidala. There's also a slothy dwarf, whose fake beard looks almost as cheap as boxer shorts from the Goodwill. And I feel sorry for the people who actually think these actors are actually any good.\n\nAnother thing wrong with the picture is the watery script and cheap direction. Is it too much to ask to deliver a decent script, even when you're on a $35 million budget? I got bored early on in the film. Nothing is exciting about the film, and watching Justin Whalin and Marlon Wayans \"act\" is enough for me to throw up my popcorn. The casting was overall poor, as they simply hired a little (or a lot) too many unexperienced actors. And it's a shame to see a talented actor such as Jeremy Irons be wasted. It's also a shame to see characters make references to a modern or earthlike culture, which is why the script is so horrid.\n\nLastly, and unfortunately, what really kills the film, is the overuse of crappy CG effects, even on a tight budget. I can't understand why the filmmakers couldn't go a little overbudget -- like some of the most successful films have -- and better tweak the obvious computer-generated dragons at an experienced visual effects house, such as Industrial Light & Magic, Sony Imageworks, or Digital Domain. It would have greatly improved the storytelling, though not the story itself, and we wouldn't get distracted from the overall experience. To me, good fx are why people go to see a movie. I know this because almost all of the top highest grossing films of all time relied heavily on fx. So what if the storytelling is ill and the characters are bland? Why do you think \"The Phantom Menace\" made so much money?"

The CGI effects are technically okay but artistically downright amateurish. Buildings are like those on the game boxes from afar but seem to be condemned warehouses close up. Sound bad? I haven't even begun to comment on the story. Why? It's simply not there. In the heydays of RPG the story was less important when good gameplay could make up for it. Those days are gone and the game producers are beginning to get to grips with that but apparently the producers of this movie have missed that. And even so, the gameplay here is an obvious lack unless you watch it on video in which case you could start fiddling with the remote control to add some action."

Next the dragons flying around above the city was about the worst visualization i've seen (I couldn't tell what was a building and what was a dragon.)\n\nFinally the story. When a movie is based off a game, 99% of the time its going to be terrible. I played the original game and it pretty much had no resemblance to this thing. Four people just running around and finding themselves in forests and caverns which don't go along with the story is(if there ever really was one.)\n\nDungeons and Dragons. 1/2 out of 5 Stars."

I might not have noticed the most infantile dialogue to profane the screen in years, the props and set design not worthy of a middle-school play, the \"follow-the-trail-of-cliches\" plot and simply atrocious acting. Most of the main heroes (although really, the audience should claim that title for surviving this piece of trash) are unknowns, and deservedly so. Wayans was irritating beyond all known human comprehension as a thief who, were he to exist in the real world, would stand less chance of stealing the proverbial candy from the baby than a leper with no hands or feet. And then there's poor Thora Birch in what looks to be a role ripped straight from Amidala in Phantom Menace (and written with even less charm, if that's possible), almost as thrilling to watch as petrifying wood, and Jeremy Irons, who skips chewing and goes right to inhaling great gobs of scenery.\n\nComplete and utter garbage. What this says about Hollywood's impression of fantasy fans is thoroughly disheartening. Thank god Peter Jackson did a good job with LOTR, or otherwise this stinker would've put the genre on ice for at least a good ten years."

At that time, this movie was a masterpiece, the likes of Willow and Wolfman... and with a similar budget to boot.\n\nI found the movie to be a fair representation of the average Dungeons and Dragons adventure, and I have had a lot of those.\n\nAlthough there were some things that I didn't agree with, I saw those for what they were, limitations of the technology of the time and of the budget. I knew going into it, that it would be a one-man production from a 19-year-old that had spent 10 years gathering the money for it. Considering the powerhouse names we see in the movie, the quality of the production and the stunning visuals, I think that was pretty well done.\n\nThis movie is skillfully made, has a solid plot worthy of the source material and the acting is on par with most AAA titles out there, despite this being a budget title and the debut of the writer/director."

But this movie not only let me down on the D&D aspect (there was a superficial resemblance, but please, a thief taking out a high-level fighter in plate?), but was also very bad as a movie.\n\nThe worst actor in the whole movie (Whalin) got the most screen time. Actually they were all pretty bad actors. Well the bad guys did a decent job with the slop they were given for lines and characters. Oh and Thora Birch's empress is basically exactly the same as the empress in Star Wars:Phantom Menace. Except she doesn't have an alter ego that allows her to move her face when she acts.\n\nAlso why does the movie have to get all preachy? The dragons are the source of magic. Killing the dragons will cause the death of the world. The elves don't manipulate magic, they are magic. Blah blah blah. Next time let greenpeace write the stupid script.\n\nBasically the story is that two common thieves decide to break into the Mage's tower to grab some cool stuff only to stumble upon a plot to over throw the empress. So they run away with the map and the girl, oh and a dwarf starts following them around for comic relief. Although he isn't that funny, and neither is Marlon Wayans (also comic relief) although he approaches funny at times.\n\nOh did I mention the nifty computer dragons? They were pretty good. And they had some other computer generated baddies from the game. So I would suggest they make a short of this. Take out all the parts where someone tries to act, except when Jeremy Irons is doing the crazy mage thing (because crazy mages are cool) and save only the scenes where there is cool CGI stuff.\n\n2/10, one point for Jeremy Irons (he came close to getting two points) and one for the dragons and other CGI stuff, plus one because one is the lowest possible score and minus one for Whalin (boy was he terrible!)."

        "review_detailed_main": "Yes, I am totally serious in my summary, but only because this rather low-rent adaptation of Dungeons & Dragons does not take itself so seriously. But therein lies the biggest problem. Dungeons & Dragons is not just a novel or a video game, it is a canon unto itself with a wealth of material that gives the likes of Superman a good contest. And because of the nature of the game, every story in Dugeons & Dragons, even if it is not necessarily entertaining or compelling, has a certain depth that is absent from this film. A good example would be the Eye Of The Beholder games. Even at their worst, the story that drove the adventures was replete with twists and turns that would have made a great motion picture. Not having played the actual game myself, even though I own one of the handbooks, I did not have any specific expectations when going into this film adaptation. Other than a decent story and some passable acting, that is. So when the first five minutes of the film passed, I was dumbfounded. Utterly dumbfounded.\n\nAside from the overly dramatic score music and poorly-written narration, the first thing you will gawk at in Dungeons & Dragons is Bruce Payne's bright blue lips. Believe me when I tell you that they are the least of the film's problems. No, the real problem becomes evident when Jeremy Irons, one of the best actors working today, walks in and overacts like he is trying to perform in the midst of a violent hypoglycaemic fit. Having had plenty of those, I am speaking from experience when I say that it is a more plausible explanation than any other offered for Irons' performance, save for director Courtney Solomon actually asking him to act this way. But it gets even worse from there. About seven minutes into the film, we get our first earful of Marlon Wayans as Snails, a Human Thief who sounds like he has been too enthusiastic with the anal probe and the helium. By the time he utters his tenth squeal, you will literally be wondering how a canon with creatures colloquially known as landsharks by the residents can suffer this kind of fool.\n\nAbout the only redeeming scene in the entire film comes when the aforementioned Payne throws Wayans off a high platform and thus kills Snails stone dead. This has given rise to a convention in all role-playing games where, at the death of a character one is meant to give a rat's bottom about but does not, one yells out \"Snails!\" in their highest, whiniest voice. It is for a good reason. There has never been a character in a film we have wanted to see die so badly. Even Jar Jar Binks had a redeeming moment when he helped give birth to the Empire. Unfortunately, Zoe McLellan and Justin Whalin soon follow this up with a political debate that looks more like a pair of whining children arguing about who is more entitled to the last chocolate bar. Unfortunately, this is not exactly a unique moment in the film, with Thora Birch presenting the heroic side of an argument about whether an absolute monarchy should be set aside in favour of democratic rule in a manner that really leaves her opposition without need to say a thing.\n\nThere are a few reasons why I prefer this mess of a film to The Lord Of The Rings. Primary among them is that where I can draw unintentional comedy value from Dungeons & Dragons, Return Of The King so seriously believes it is high art that even its failure to notice that it reads like the result of only reading every tenth page of the novel is excruciating. I laughed at D&D. By the time LOTR finally rolled out its credits for the last time, I was crying. But comparisons to one of the worst film adaptations of a novel in history cannot save D&D from the fact that it is a stunning example that one should be careful what they wish for. For years, vocal fans of the game made it clear they wanted a film made by someone who was a fan of the game, as opposed to \"the suits\", the accountants who really run Hollywood. Well, they got what they wanted, with director Courtney Solomon being a fan so determined to make the film according to the idea of D&D that he had in his head that even his own lack of ability as a director could not stop him.\n\nAnd that, in a nutshell, is what killed Dungeons & Dragons at the box office. It is one thing to take a film so seriously that no fun can be discerned from the story when it is needed. It is another entirely to treat the thing as a complete joke. Because nobody in the story is taking their part seriously, the entire deal fails to connect with the viewer on any level, which is a fatal error where fantasy stories are concerned. The traditional market for these kinds of stories has been dominated by intellects, or the kind of people who would be reading Heinlein if they were not reading these stories, so treating the genre in such a cheap fashion is not the way to engage your audience. Especially not when the material you are making a mess of has so much potential. A power struggle between the mages and everyone else in the realm is not an easy story idea to waste so utterly. One reviewer once wrote that making a film or game this bad out of nothing is an everyday event, but making a film or game so bad out of source material like this takes a special effort.\n\nHence, Dungeons & Dragons gets a one out of ten from me. It is so bad one can watch it just to see how terrible films really get."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am surprised this film has received so much negative comment here - it is clearly intended to be exactly the type of film it is, that is to say a film with strongly typecast characters, lots of effects, predictable plot (and plenty of plot-holes) ... and when viewed in that light it is a whole lot of fun.\n\nMy wife and I found it a highly entertaining Saturday night's viewing. I should add that before seeing this film she did not know what Dungeons & Dragons was, while I used to play it a fair bit (ahem) in my misspent adolescent years. The film managed the great feat of creating a world which was at the same time completely understandable to someone who was uninitiated and entirely familiar to someone acquainted with the principles of the game.\n\nI cannot understand the zero ratings this film has received from some reviewers. I have fairly mainstream tastes, and in terms of plot, dialogue, lack of characterisation and so on, it is certainly no worse a film than Star Wars The Phantom Menace or one of the Die Hard films - again, not exactly high-brow films but thoroughly enjoyable nevertheless, and certainly the kind of film I like to watch to relax.\n\nIndeed, some elements in this film are outstanding: the costumes, the gothic imagery, the real-life locations in Prague (dig that library!).\n\nAmong the actors, we were particularly impressed by Justin Whalin, who made a fine and believable young hero, without any of the brattish qualities that a lot of actors in similar roles have had (think Mark Hamill), also by Kristen Wilson who is simply a delight for the eyes. We had not heard of her before, (we have not seen Dr Doolittle) ... but it seemed to us absolutely right to cast a lithe and graceful former ballerina in the role of an elf. Or should that be a half-elf, perhaps? It was not clear why Norda and Halvath looked significantly different from the other elves unless they were half-elves.\n\nIn terms of accurate portrayal of D&D the game, I very much liked: the fact that all the characters had a clearly defined class; the rivalry between different character classes; the clear alignment of characters (chaotic good, lawful evil etc); the fact that magic users needed ingredients (e.g. magic dust used by Marina Pretensa) for their spells; all the traps; the 'game balance' that is to say that there were few monsters and that most 'opponents' were humans/humanoids; the fact that Profion had a familiar. I did not think it was accurate that a thief (Snails) should be clumsy, nor that characters who were supposed to be of low levels of experience (Pretensa, Snails and Ridley) had so many high level abilities - Ridley's excellent fighting skills, Pretensa's powerful spells. Also I found the presence of what were apparently orcs in the tavern to be a trifle bizarre.\n\nHaving watched this on DVD, one thing stands out, though, and that is that some inexplicable and, can I say, inept cuts were made in producing the final print. Several key scenes which are absolutely necessary to understand the plot have been cut - one where Elwood Gutworthy (the dwarf) introduces himself to the rest of the party, one where Ridley and Pretensa are actually inside the scroll and given a map of how to find the Rod, one where the romantic interest between Norda and Snails is developed. There is no apparent reason for these cuts - certainly the quality of the deleted scenes on the DVD is just as good as the rest (although of course they have not received post-production processes - you can actually see the sudden transition from polished to less-polished in the Norda/Snails scene). If other reviewers have given the film low ratings because of these cuts, I can perhaps understand it ...\n\nAnd to any director/editor/studio thinking of cutting scenes as a result of test audience feedback, I have a piece of advice for you: Don't. (For a good example of why this is not a good idea, see the 'Making of' feature on Twelve Monkeys.)"

Evil mage Profion (Jeremy Irons) is plotting to depose Empress Savina (Thora Birch) who is trying to institute some equality. He's trying control the dragons. Thieves Ridley (Justin Whalin) and Snails (Marlon Wayans) try to steal from the Magic School. They are caught by inexperienced mage Marina (Zoe McLellan). They find Profion's henchman Damodar (Bruce Payne) killing the master mage while trying to find the Rod of Savrille which controls Red Dragons. Marina manages to escape with the scroll followed closely by the thieves. They encounter dwarf Elwood and elf Norda. Together they battle Damodar in the search for the Rod.\n\nThis is a bad movie. It starts bad but it gets even worst. Jeremy Irons is horribly overacting. It gets worst in the climax because he is such a big part of it. Thora Birch seems lost trying act opposite his crazy performance. The clunky dialog doesn't help in the least. The climax also has a lot of CGI. The problem with that is the bad CGI. Dragons should be cool but these look cheesy.\n\nThe meat of the movie is bad but not horrible. The group's quest is a series of adventures that feels manufactured like the game itself. Justin Whalin is a second rate actor doing his best. Zoe McLellan is pretty good. Marlon Wayans sometimes go overboard trying to joke around. The costumes look like Hollywood leftovers. The quest is not that bad for a B-movie, but the climatic battle is simply too horrible to watch. The blame has to be laid at director Courtney Solomon's feet. He should have told Irons to dial back a couple of levels. And somebody needs to take a course in writing."

With that said it was pretty much inevitable that I would find my way to the theatre to watch this flick in spite of the less than favourable reviews. The good news is that I stayed until the closing credits (mainly to see who the director was so I could avoid his future work at all costs). The bad news is that this is the worst movie I've seen since Highlander 2. Why is it that the characters in every fantasy movie have to speak with bad British accents? And why are elves always represented as being emotionless and coldly intellectual. I have yet to see a fantasy movie where the elf character is more than a Vulcan with a longsword. And talk about terrible acting. Go watch Thora Birch in American Beauty and then catch her in this disaster. It's like they've got her doped up on cold medication. She enunciates each syllable in slow motion as if even she can't believe how bad her dialogue is. I won't even begin to talk about Jeremy Irons but I will say it's really hard to take his main henchman (kind of a Darth Vader without the helmet) seriously when the guy wears blue lipstick. What's up with that? I kept expecting his backup singers to show up.\n\nStory wise, the struggling Empress routine is far too similar to Phantom Menace. There's really nothing new here at all. Pick any detail of this movie and it's been done somewhere before. Any D&D nerd will tell you that the potential storylines for this genre could fill a +5 bag of holding. But in spite of that, the filmmakers settled on what amounts to a yard sale of recycled gags and cheap thrills. Even the effects, which are few and far between, are pretty weak. The dragon in Dragonheart was a lot more realistic and that movie was made like a million years ago!\n\nAll in all, I've gotta respect that this is Courtney Solomon's first crack at being a director and he went to the Nine Hells and back to have it made. Unfortunately, I think this is going to set first time directors back for many years to come. Make your saving throw and avoid this movie at all costs. Spend your ten bucks on a new set of dice."

I choose to view the movie in one of two ways, either as a cheesy movie to laugh at with friends, or to view it as the minds eye of a bunch of people around a table playing dungeons and dragons.\n\nYes it's by no means a good film, but for me it falls in the \"So bad it's good\" category with the above relations to an average d&d game as a pleasant side note."

Nothing in this movie is original by any means, and it has all been done much, MUCH better.

However, in this film these things are done in a despicable way. When they try to do comedy it gets bad, when they try to do an adventure it gets even worse and when they risk drama you give up on the movie. All the performances are terrible and that hurts even more. If the movie was a little shorter it would be less worse, but in the third act they stretch too much and it makes everything worse.

I must admit that i thought the same way at the time but recently i watched the movie once again and it's not that bad, considering that it tries to create a whole new story, not just reproducing probably the best fantasy world ever conceived. Although the main elements (dragons, mages, elves etc.) are \"borrowed\" from Tolkien's universe there is some potential for a good sequel or something... Anyway, what i really meant to say is that i think this deserves a better vote average than 3.8 (at the time i wrote this comment). Of course i am a great fan of Dungeons and Dragons universe and my vote might be a bit exaggerated.

There are decent images and scenes, but this is an inexpensive movie that is worth seeing at the matinee or second-run. It's been a while since a decent fantasy film has been released, and this one is decent.\n\nThe acting was over-the-top and the plot was redux from many other films, but that did not matter. You should go into this movie expecting standard fantasy. Nobody has been claiming this movie is a great dramatical work. It's fun, entertaining, and sometimes goes out of its way to make fun of itself.\n\nThe cast has several strong names, but you get the idea they are making fun of themselves and the movie they are in with their performances. Though Marlon Wayans does turn in a good performance as Snails the bumbling thief. However, most of the cast seems to be just learning to act, which adds to the over-acting.\n\nI gave this movie a 6 out of 10 because it was worth my time and in a genre devoid of current movies, it was above average. Is it as good as Highlander (1986), The Princess Bride (1987), Willow (1988), Excalibur (1981), or Conan the Barbarian (1982)? No, but then it is not as bad as Highlander II: The Quickening (1991), Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn (1983), or Leonard Part (1987) ...some of the worst movies of all time. To compare to a recent movie, Dungeons and Dragons (2000) was more enjoyable than Red Planet (2000)."

That may not sound like a lot but they weren't spending 100-200 million on films back when this was made. I knew people who worked on it and heard it was a train wreck and that Courtney Solomon had no idea how to make a movie, especially when it came to effects, and was pissing money into the wind, which is why you don't see any of the money in the film. In fact all you can gather from watching this film is that Courtney embezzled the money he was given or he is the biggest idiot on the planet who tried to act like a big shot and like he did know what he was doing and squandered it all on his mistakes. The only reason he got to make a movie is because he owned the rights to the name \"Dungeons & Dragons\" and someone was stupid enough to give someone with no experience a decent budget. It says the movie cost 45 million but I remember reading it in the papers and he was given 35. Either 45 is incorrect or they had to spend an extra 10 million to finish the film. Everything about this film was awful. It wasn't even like a story. It was liking watching a D&D game being played in real life, which maybe D&D gamers would enjoy that...maybe, but no one else would. Justin Whalin is the worst casting for this role and this movie pretty much killed his career. He was pretty big and well known in the '90s and you never heard a peep out of him after this awful film. He is too small and just does not look like a heroic action guy at all. The effects in this film are terrible. They look like really bad video game effects. And you can tell they are short on money because they use this same shot twice where the camera sweeps and circles around a computer generated tower. It was probably the most expensive shot in the film so they felt compelled to use it twice. They have a scene where you know they ran out of money because the actors talk about the creature that is in the distance, that looks like a speck on screen. The actors are describing it, rather than showing it, because it's clear Courtney had blown all his money at this point. Only a total idiot makes an animation company show completed animation BEFORE he gives approval. That's what pre-viz and the design team is for. It's no wonder the only thing he's worked on since then are cruddy, low budget B-movies."

The other worthy two seconds of special effects were seen in the trailer where the mages put up a magic shield and launch fireballs at the dragons. Other than that - the special effects, costumes, CGI, etc were beneath the production quality of Hercules, Xena, etc.\n\nDo yourself a favor... don't waste your time.

The story is simplistic at best, and downright silly at worst. The characters are one dimensional, and I regret that this is the first movie in a while that featured Wil Wheaton. He deserved much, much better than this. And don't get me started on the funny sidekick.\n\nIf you can get hold of the second movie - the Wrath of the Dragon God - then watch that instead of this regurgitated mess. Please. Seriously, I'm on my knees over here.\n\nOh yeah, and even I can make better CG than that. OK, maybe not, but I do know someone who does. So watch the 'sequel' instead of this one. Except if you get a warm and fuzzy feeling from watching Jeremy Irons. Then go watch The Man In The Iron Mask or something."

Birch is also emotionless throughout the film. However, it is the main character that delivers the worst performance. Never have I seen a character that annoys me so much. It is sad when one has to say that the best performance of the film came from one of the Wayan brothers...in a relatively serious role. And what is with the dwarf? What was his purpose in the film? However, as much as the acting in the film was dreadful, the script was even more so. UGH!!! The script sounded like a fantasy story I wrote when I was in elementary school. HMM...I wonder if I could make a movie off of those stories? It seems like anyone can make a bad movie these days and get away with it. Last and Foremost though, this movie turns my stomach because I am a player of the Dungeons and Dragons game. Odiously, this film falsely establishes the game as a shallow romp, when in fact it is a medium with the depth and range of cinema. Ultimately, this film is a travesty to the genre of fantasy. This film could have truly been great...given a different script, director, and actors. P.S. What was the purpose of the ending?"

        "review_detailed_main": "Lets face it: most people doing movies, especially fantasy movies are morons. Conan The Barbarian is one of the few good pre 'Lord Of The Rings' fantasy films, yet most pre-LOTR fantasy films tried to ape up CtB inferior sequel 'Conan The Destroyer' and 'Red Sonja'. This is also the case with 'Dungeons And Dragons', a movie based on the famous RPG.\n\nA couple of months ago I might have gone as far as claimed, that DnD was the worst movie I've ever had pleasure to witness, but that was before I had introduced myself to the \"movies\" made by Dr. Boll. That is the level DnD manages to stay out of, yet I am not claiming this to be a good movie, quite the opposite really. It just is as bad, that it is actually quite hilarious. In every aspect, expect when it tries to be funny.\n\nThe badness of the film ranges from the notable actors to the feeble script. Jeremy Irons, one of the greatest actors of our time, is hamming up the role of eeevil mage Profion just from the heck of it. His overacting is so dramatic that it is drop dead funny. Funniest character of the film is Mr. Blue Lips (Bruce Payne ), vastly overacting henchman of Profit, er, Profion.\n\nThe plot is quite simple: the empress Savina (Thora Birch) is like the guide book to American Democracy, trying to give equal right to commoners and mages. Profion is of course the baddie, who wants the power. So Jimmy Olsen, sorry, Ridley (Justin Whalin, who hasn't changed since 'Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman') and totally unfunny lines throwing Snails (Marlon Wayans), who is just a bit above Jar Jar Binks, need to get Eye of The Dragon in order to get Staff Of The Dragon, that can control dragons. Oh and they have this dwarf sidekick, who has the most laughable false beard of the movie history.\n\nThe writing is simply put amateurish from the pro democracy speeches of the empress (isn't that a bit of an oxymoron really), to the badly done death scenes and hilariously bad lines thrown by Irons.\n\nCGI effect scenes would be good, if they would be sticked on a computer game, though lately more than few games have shown better graphics than DnD does.\n\nTo put this all in perspective, DnD is not the worst film I've seen, it's just a bad movie. It's bad in a way it is hilarious.\n\nReal movie score: 2 out of 10. I kind of liked a couple of scenes in the film.\n\nCamp movie score: 8 out of 10. If this isn't a future camp classic I don't know what is. Mr. Blue lips alone is enough to rise this movie in the same league with Ed Wood's 'Plan Nine from Outer Space'."

I've tried to focus on the good parts.\n\nJeremy Irons seem to like playing bad mage and he does it with some style. Marlon Wayans character is not too good though, he lost a lot of the respect he earned with me from the excellent \"Requiem for a dream\". Mr. \"Saving the world\" himself is unstable, there are times that he reminds me of what I thought the hero in D&D would look and act like, but in some scenes he seems more like a boy scout than a hero.\n\nThe visual part of the movie is ok. There are some good animating (and some less good) and moody settings. A few times I actually felt that the scenes matched quite a lot with my impression of the game. The people in charge of the costumes also need a pat on the shoulder, especially Irons \"good guy\" costume was nice.\n\nFor the action freaks there might be some good moments...for me there was one fighting scene that was worth watching over again, but not more than that either.\n\nTo sum things up a bit: It's bad, sort of really bad, but with a few glimpses of potential for the observant ones. In other words this is not a movie you need to see. I'm sure there are other movies that will please you a lot more.\n\nRating: 3/10\n\n\u00d8yvind Holen"

Whether you love fantasy, or believe it to be the realm of spotty-faced young men with no social life, the franchise itself is so huge (and has such an enormous fan base) and has such scope for development that the film-makers should've been frothing at the mouth with excitement. Unfortunately, the end result appears to be frothing at the mouth with no more then rabies. Firstly, it looks terrible. Half the battle with a fantasy film is convincing your audience that such a world could exist, and using cheap CGI effects are not the way to do this. Not only that, the 'Dragon Mace of Wobbly Destructiveness' (or something) worryingly resembled a plastic 'He-Man' toy. Hmmmm. The acting gets no better. Whalin and McLellan look great without achieving much, yet even a bad script cannot forgive Jeremy Irons, one of the strongest actors from these Isles, for committing such crimes against humanity. The plot, as you may have guessed, was almost non-existent in its simplicity.\n\nOnly Richard O'Brien walks away with any credit, stealing the show with a gleefully malicious cameo halfway through. Yet this just isn't even to atone for the film's many sins. Die-hard fantasy maniacs may get some perverse satisfaction from the film, but the rest of us will just carry on waiting for 'Lord of the Rings'.\n\n2/10"

This movie is the very definition of \"so bad that it's actually pretty good\". Let the cliches fly! This movie is definitely not a Great Art Experience, and everyone who is looking for a good, serious, well made fantasy movie should stay FAR away from it... and let us who like to torture ourselves with bad movies to see it.

It's about 80% watchable, 10% teeth-grating PC platitudes and 10% mildly interesting. The interesting: Jeremy Irons is a delight to watch. I hope he didn't break his teeth on the scenery. The carpet trap is good, and the fate of the odious comic relief is certainly a relief. The feel of the film somehow manages an undefinable sense of the game. I'm not sure how, but it does. Perhaps a badly-played game with a very poor DM, but the game nevertheless. The Teeth-gritting: Elves spouting envirospeak about dragons being precious things; An Empress who rules by the power of a rod of dragon control declares everyone equal,as if that was some sort of legal definition. I can only assume she means \"Equal under my absolute rule.\" Some of the more obviously stolen scenes, and there are many, from George Lucas films. The Primary Villain's Henchmen's makeup choices. The rest of the movie is an assemblage of scenes edited together, often in senseless ways, which one just watches with no particular feeling except to note inconsistencies. Gamers will note that these characters are pretty low-level and obviously useless, and there's no way they could roll well enough to make it through this game alive. The acting, with a few exceptions, is merely adequate, but the characters portrayed are so stereotypical that it's difficult to see how they could have been better. The special effects are of the quality of a modern video game, and are poorly used. There's very little magic in evidence in the script, so we don't get to see cool spells. The dragons, well...they have the interest of the droid soldiers from Phantom Menace and less personality. They're just monsters, not characters, so the relative quality of their animation is rather moot. They really don't add anything. You don't care if one dies, and there are far too many in evidence to focus on any one. So, sorry--while this film is watchable, I can't see any reason to see it in theatres. Rent the video when it comes off the new release section.\n\nI rate it a 5."

The majority of the leads are talentless hacks; I have no problems with unknowns, but unknowns who can't act are clear indication that a film is already off the rails and heading into a ditch. The \"name\" performers in the film turn in strangely sub-par performances, as well -- Thora Birch does a fine impression of a wooden plank, while Jeremy Irons chews the scenery so thoroughly one wonders if he's getting enough fiber in his diet from other sources. And the less said about Marlon Wayans' \"Stepin Fetchit\" character the better.\n\nIt's worse if you know the game, because the production team certainly *didn't*. It wouldn't have been hard or expensive to get all the details right, no more so than it was to get them *wrong* -- and doing them right would at least have gotten the crew points for *trying*. But it's clear that this was not a labor of love, no matter what the director has claimed, simply a fast hack job. Perhaps it was cranked out quick and sloppy because the rights were about to expire, like the 1994 \"Fantastic Four\" movie.\n\nMy final take: this film isn't even worth renting -- save your money for something more worthwhile, like \"Plan Nine From Outer Space\"."

At times I felt like leaping from my seat and running from the theater. The only redeeming qualities of the whole movie were the locations and sets. The acting was bad, the stereotyping was nearly unbearable, the costumes were ala Power Rangers, and the dragons themselves lacked scales and any sense of power. The special effects budget would have been better spent on one excellent dragon, instead of scores of poor ones. Worst of all, they tried to extricate themselves from the situation with misplaced humor.\n\nWant to introduce someone to the D&D genre? Try these movies: Legend (with Tom Cruise) Classic artifact retrieval plot\n\nLadyHawke (Rutger Hauer, Michelle Pfeiffer, Matthew Broderick) Curse plot\n\nConan The Barbarian (Arnold Schwarzenegger) Classic Revenge plot\n\nDragonslayer (Can you guess the plot from the title?) :)\n\nExcalibur (Patrick Stewart and many others) crusade/quest plot\n\nHawk The Slayer (Jack Palance) Haven't seen this one in a while, but remember it as being solid for its era, even though it's shabby by today's standards.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, there's an axiom in show business that runs something like this: Don't give your audience what they want until you're ready for them to leave. Unfortunately D&D the movie is replete with dragons, and all the while spend their time in the service of humans. This is !!!NOT!!! what D&D is about... in fact, this movie is a perfect example of the worst of the worst 'Monty Haul' campaigns as outlined in the first edition Dungeon Master's Guide. I should go back and change my summary from 'They killed it with one mighty blow...' to 'Absolute power corrupts absolutely'. This movie sorely needed some technical advisors and a more humble sense of purpose to steer it out of it's meteoric nosedive.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJon R Colchagoff jr (Dungeons & Dragons player and DM since 1981)"

I've often heard people say that if it's only entertaining for children, it's not a good movie/book. Well I apply the same rule here. If it's only entertaining for D&D game players, it's not a good movie."

I give mega props to the animators. Jeremy played the best Lawful Evil character I'd ever seen. I'd put him in the same class as Emporer Palpatine. The only thing I felt was wanting in this movie was the Elf and the Dwarf. The Dwarf was way too tall, but he made up for it with his hatred/fear of horses, insatiable appetite and his willingness to drain the tavern of every drop of ale. The Elf..well, she was NOT an Elf by any stretch of the imagination. Short black hair, dark skin, horrible costume, and her overacting wasn't much better. I felt she looked and acted more like a Vulcan than anything else. Marlon and Justin worked extremely well together. The chemistry between them made the characters totally believable. If you are into D&D, this is a must see."

For the first time in a while, I was in a movie not sure if or when a protagonist was going to bite it.\n\nThere were times when I felt teased - like 'The Maze' - I expected there would be just one more trap, another challenge, something truly sinister. I wanted to see more of a dragon, not more dragons.\n\nBut all in all - it is a light and campy film. Sometimes the dialogue seems a bit too slow - but I believe this is just so that kids (who are as much of a target as anyone) don't get lost in it.\n\nIronically, the overacting of it all TRULY fits if you consider what it is - Dungeons and Dragons. Camped around a Dungeon Master on a late Friday night... I've seen just about every aspect that they had. The snobbish elf, the drunken (grumpy) dwarf. The Ambitious Mage and the Newfie Mage. The Swashbuckler and the greedy thief that rarely stops to think about just how much noise all that stuff they steal is going to make...\n\nI guess a compliment for this movie would be my desire to see this turned into a live version of the old 80's Dungeons and Dragons Cartoon - available on the Sci-Fi network or something.\n\nEither way, hopefully this movie fares well enough to pique the interests of one of the larger movie houses to continue this into a fairly decent franchise... otherwise, like the game, we'll just have to keep playing and enjoying it on our own.\n\n--Micah"

Yes, it's a dumb, dumb movie with a worthless script that must be blamed for the fact that Irons, an Oscar-winner for 'Reversal of Fortune', is outclassed by a Wayans brother. Granted, the guy has made dumb career moves in the past. Luckily he boasts very little screen time and is surrounded by a full complement of equally insipid performances (including Thora Birch in full 'Monkey Trouble' mode apparently reading cue cards).\n\nIndeed, roughly by the midway point of this thing - when Bruce Payne's blue-Slurpee-lipped henchman Damodar catches thief Ridley (Justin Whalin) in the act of stealing a map and snickers \"just like a thief, always taking things that don't belong to you\" - you pretty much know what you've paid for...FX.\n\nAnd plenty of them.\n\n'D&D' is so mired in fantastical visions of gravity-defying CG structures and backdrops, I was surprised to find that the movie was primarily filmed in England and the Czech Republic(!). The snippets of the film not created on an iMac appeared to be pure Hollywood backlot material. And while many will and have realized, 'D&D' borrows - heavily - from other movies, notably some outrageously recognizable scenes straight out of both 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'.\n\nUgh.

The only reason I actually found myself in a theater to watch this bomb was the insistence of my friend Michael, who somehow convinced me and, believe it or not, four of our other friends that this movie would probably be hilarious. I can't say he was wrong.\n\nWe had hoped the theater would be empty so that we could openly deride the film, and it basically was...but another group of four or five other people walked in just before the beginning of the film. I was expecting this would leave our cynical hopes dashed, but, to my great delight, as the film started, they proved to have the same intentions as us. I tell you with no less then ten people mocking every second of lameness in this movie, it made for many a hearty laugh.\n\nAnd there are quite a few lame moments in Dungeons and Dragons. Even the tagline is lame: \"Adventure hinges on more than just a throw of the dice.\" Sounds like an advertisement for the game.\n\nWhat business does anyone have basing a movie on a game without plot anyway? I will admit to having played the game before (but only with great shame, as if I were admitting to clubbing baby seals), and it's nothing more than a set of rules from which the players are supposed to create a story. Not much meat for a film, eh?\n\nBut what really astonishes me is the presence of actors I recognize in this thing. I mean, Jeremy Irons is in this movie. What's going on with that? It's also got Marlon Wayans and American Beauty's Thora Birch. I suppose that's a little less weird, but still: huh? Irons and Birch give the worst performances in a movie filled with bad performances, too. Irons shakes his fists and grits his teeth continuously while uttering lines that our sometimes impossible to understand; it's as if he's having a seizure or something. Birch oozes so much artificial sweetness, one expects the ending may reveal her to be a gigantic PEZ dispenser.\n\nMaybe this isn't all Birch's fault though. I mean, all she ever does in the movie is run around yapping about how the mages and commoners should be equal (class structure is apparently based on magic). She might start by not calling them \"commoners.\"\n\nOf course, the entire plot makes no sense, anyway. Something to do with Irons's character wanting a magical rod that controls dragons, but only if they're red...and depicted with B-rate special effects.\n\nLike I said, watching this movie was funny because of the specific circumstances I found myself in. Otherwise, though, I think I would have been shaking my fist at the scene with all the anger of the Irons character. Avoid. 1/10"

Thora Birch, while giving Queen Amidala a run for her money in the costuming department, is certainly out of her depth in this as well. Every line that falls from her mouth rings totally hollow. Marlon Wayans as Snails the thief is equally out of place, the supposed humor he provides falling flat. Zoe McLellan is intermittently watchable, but her wide-eyed intensity becomes tiresome. Perhaps we can blame the editor and director for her performance, since they are already to blame for so many of the problems with this film. Much of what happens in the plot is referred to in dialogue or transpires off camera. This sort of thing points to script problems and production troubles and is symptomatic of heavy-handed editing for running-time considerations. Perhaps scenes were shot and did not work out. Maybe money or time constraints forced dialogue to stand in for cut sequences. But more likely, this was just a poorly-conceived and executed waste of time with passable but by-now overly familiar swooping computer animation of fantasy cityscapes and dragons in flight."

Justin Whalin was a revelation, displaying some leading man qualities found in Mad Max (Mel Gibson), Conan the Barbarian (Arnie), even The Mummy (Brendan Fraser).

(She was great in the Star Trek Voyager and Sliders episodes I remember spotting her in) And she's gorgeous, to boot! Richard O'Brian was as weasly and grimy as he always seems to be. (Keep it up!)

The movie didn't have the story it needed to be called D&D (unfortunely, many great stories have been slaughtered by movie attempts i.e. Final Fantasy). There was a good amount of action, but that was it. There was little from the game that I saw in the movie.\n\nPerhaps a REAL D&D movie will be made, written by experienced DM's, and it will have LOTR-ish special effects to bring out the fantasy of the world. We can all hope for that movie, which would be more successful, esp. for gamers like me and my friends.\n\nThis movie was made bad, not really by the acting (yes, in some cases the acting sucked), but by the lack of story and character development. With such a poorly developed movie, its no wonder the D&D name was tarnished in some ways by it.\n\nHowever, I did enjoy the movie, and even though I laughed during it, I did enjoy it enough to watch it a couple of times. I would only recommend that you forget the title of the movie when you're watching, because D&D really isn't that bad."

At first I thought it was about as bad as afternoon television. Then I realized that it was worse than that. I've zapped into about 15 secs of \"Power Rangers\" on TV once - that's about how bad the acting was.\n\nThe storyline was flimsy, with lots of logical errors in it.\n\nThe visuals were cheap, and you could see it. the computer graphics didn't blend into the set very well where it was blended into a real scene. Where there were computer-only shots, they looked horrible. The equipment shown was cheap - I've seen better stuff in life-action roleplay.\n\nStill, I had a good laugh. In fact, one scene - by far not the worst, I guess it was just one overdone scene too many - sent me into fits of uncontrolled laughter. I tried to stop myself from laughing out loud - but I couldn't. It was just too bad.\n\nSo, the resume: It's good to know that B-movies are still being produced, that hollywood it a place where, as an actor, you can get a chance, even if you don't deserve it."

I mean don't get me wrong, it was in the cinemas way before it came out, but I'm just saying that because the director Courtney Solomon was seriously terrible by making this movie, if the whole crew nee what Dungeons & Dragons was all about.\n\nDungeons & Dragons is one of those rare movies that simply gets everything wrong. For example: The story is wrong, the writing is wrong, and the casting and characters is wrong, and especially the funny looking FX is wrong!\n\nAnd none of this didn't make any sense from D&D, they just like to mess some things up when you try to come up with an idea of your own.

I got what I expected, plus a little more. I found it pretty engaging, with some great special effects, and some pretty good action scenes. Of course there were flaws, and even though I haven't played the game in about 10 years, I still noticed a few things out of place, such as the thief being able to fight as well as he did, and not doing thiefly things, such as using his backstab ability. Plus the dragons didn't talk, they seemed kind of mindless. But the good parts outweighed the bad. For example, as is required by the screenwriters guild since last year, every fantasy/sci-fi movie must have a Jar-Jar like character, but in D&D, they kill him. Which of course rocks, especially when this Jar-Jar happens to be the most popular actor in the film. I also dug the hell out of the Dwarf, he had the best lines of course.\n\nOver all, I gave the film an 8, and perusing through reviews, I see that a lot of people claimed this to be the worst movie of the year. Obviously they didn't see Battlefield Earth. At least D&D had action, and somewhat of a plot."

The amount of detail that went into the costumes, the weaponry, the backdrops and CGI dragons was phenomenal, pulling me into this world the way I've never been before. Unfortunately, that's where it ends.\n\nThe script of this movie is debilitating. I couldn't believe a grown-up wrote some of the supposedly derisive barbs traded between Ridley, Snails and Damodar that were right off the schoolyard. I felt bad for Bruce Payne, a wonderfully wicked actor, who had to suffer through bad line after bad line. Jeremy Irons suffers the same fate, another brilliant actor plagued by extremely poor writing.\n\nWe D&D fans have waited a long time for a movie in our beloved genre and I personally thank Wizards of the Coast for having the vision to bring TSR's world to the big screen. However, it fell way short, despite the wonderful actors and deep, rich underworlds of D&D.\n\nI fear this may be the last decent effort of a movie in the D&D universe, as I look ahead to the Lord of the Rings trilogy for redemption in the medieval fantasy realm."

        "review_detailed_main": "As many others, I stepped into the theatre, expecting very little.. in hopes of being rewarded with more than expected. (which has worked for me several times in the past i.e. Starship Troopers) The only thing i was rewarded with was several \"Oh my God\"s I spewed out as I shook my head in dismay, scene after scene. I was actually embarrassed I had suggested seeing this movie, and apologised to my two friends for having to endure this film with me. Fantasy based movies are few and very far between, and it just hurt to see such an cinematic opportunity passed by in a world that has been so fleshed out.\n\nThinking back to the old D&D days, I had alot of fun in the Borderlands and the Isle of Dread, and was hoping this movie would bring back some of those lost memories. I was hoping this movie would do to 'Dungeons and Dragons' what Kevin Smiths direction has done to 'comics'... pull away some of the geekiness society has attached to it. If anything, it has marred those still playing the game even further! :P\n\nThe movie is pieced together seemingly missing several scenes. The characters are way too melodramatic. (and I love Jeremy Irons.. but i cringe everytime the camera pans to him in this movie) Justin Whalin has good potential as Ridly, as does Zoe McLellan as Marina.. but characters can only do so much with such a spotty script. Direction? Watchable scenes tended (for me) to be the comical ones. I dreaded Wayan's character, but it ended up being my favourite, even with his urban accent. I'd of never figured a fantasy movie would need comedy to stay afloat. CGI was watchable. Nothing great, but atleast its topic was fantasy and something not seen often.\n\nWell, atleast us fantasy fans still have LoTR's to look forward too still. I have a much stronger feeling for that, but it looks like they shelled out a few more dollars for acting in it as well. Hopefully the direction and script is better. Anyway, if you can wait, watch D&D in the dollar theatre in about three weeks, which is when it should shift there (unless it misses that completely and goes straight to video). I gave it three stars, because they did have a budget, and still failed so horridly."

Looking for a film that will show what fantasy is all about? Go watch Time Bandits. If, however, you are looking for a shameless, plot-hole-ridden, Jeremy-Irons-powered big ol' greasy CGI-fest of a movie, you've got it right here. Yes friends, D&D is just as bad as you think it is, but at least it's quite entertaining.\n\nUm...isn't Jeremy Irons a good actor? What is he smoking here? Your guess is as good as mine, but he hams up most every scene he has with hilarious efficiency. John Steiner (of Sinbad fame) should be proud for the homage, though I think Irons was in on the joke. Thora Birch (the teen-angst chick from American Beauty) doesn't fare near as well, with her amazing cross-pollination of William Shatner with Queen Amidalia. She manages to get the worst aspects of both, while still giving a completely straight delivery-I'd venture to say she's worse than Irons. Oh, the others need some work for sure, but those two are standouts.\n\nThe hero guy is passable but imminently forgettable, Marlon Wayans is...surprise, Marlon Wayans, the dwarf is there for the sole reason that he is a dwarf-a tall one at that, and the elf-lady knows entirely too much about the plot. I guess the best actors are really the mage girl, who does a decent job with what she has, and the blue lipstick guy, who would be more credible if not for his makeup job. It's hard to be cowering in fear from a man who looks like he just had his Mary Kay makeover...I'm guessing he's a winter.\n\nBut I'm going into too much detail. It's fun, gosh darn it! It has big CGI dragons fighting each other! It has overacting out the gazombus! It has an incomprehensible ending! It's hardly like the paper game or the books! Get your MST3K gang together, and go to town. Now that's entertainment."

One character is just \"good\" end of story, and the other is also \"bad\" again, end of story which in my opinion is better left for the story books as people are not just \"good\" or \"bad\" and also the bit when the main character dies.... I had to stuff my mouth full of popcorn just TO STOP LAUGHING!\n\nThis movie isn't something that is incredible bad, it does have its moments like the end dragon fights and to be honest, thats around it!

The story was simple, but enough. The effects were passable for the small budget. The weakest points are the acting and the directing. Most of the time the \"movie\" feels like a high school play on the big screen. Birch and Irons (who are usually very good) are terrible in this movie; Irons over acts and Birch under acts. Whalin, Wayans and McLellan are just B-grade TV actors and it shows. Bruce Payne as Damodar was probably the most interesting character and gave a Darth Maul-like passable performance.\n\nThe directing never brought me into the movie. Solomon never created a believable world; everything was too clean and looked like a movie set. He certainly never tried to get a good performance out of his actors.\n\nI watched this movie on DVD for $1, and I do feel that I got my money's worth, but not by much. The DVD does feature lots of deleted scenes and an alternate ending (the non-sequel ending). The most telling scene included here is an outtake which shows just how much Jeremy Irons did NOT want to be part of this movie. He gives his line, and then walks off the set in total disgust.\n\nIf you want to see this movie, I recommend Long's Drugs on Wednesday nights when they have their 99 cent movie night."

The editing is extremely rough and amateur, a plot is only vaguely implied, and the characters have about as much charisma as extras pulled onto the set at the last minute. The film flows so poorly as to almost seem like several different films edited together.\n\nI expected that this film was aimed at someone like myself: a fan both of the game and of the fantasy genre, and a big Irons fan to boot. None of the characters (and their obscure motivations) were like anything one would encounter in the D&D game or in fantasy fiction (and should probably go back to whatever MTV show they were discovered on). There was very little swordplay, very little magic, and whilst there were a few dragons, we never find out what their role is in the film. They just sort of appear as required props. A very odd, hypnotically unpleasant film that wears one out like an endless trip to the grocer's, where when you finally get to the checkout, you find your cart is empty.\n\nHigh marks however for Zoe McLellan, who acts with grace and beauty and deserves much better roles. And as for Jeremy Irons, once one of the greats...Die Hard and now this? Perhaps commercials would be kinder to him...I would rather hear him talk about the new Mazda then see him end his career in travesty."

It is utterly horrible and a waste of anyone's money.The reason, though, that I gave this \"movie\" a 4 is because, for some reason, whenever it is on T.V, it is one of the best movies ever. If it weren't so bad it could be considered a cult classic.\n\nFirst off, the acting is horrible. Jeremy Irons, a terrific actor, is at his worst. He probably didn't give it his all as he could've thought that it would be a \"campy hoot\" to be in this flick. Thora Birch (yes, FRESH off of American Beauty) makes it seem like this is her first movie. Bruce Payne is constantly over-acting and never tones it down; it really might've helped the movie. Justin Whalin delivers the worst \"NOOOO!\" ever and really can't show emotions very well. Just think of him as the poor-man's Keanu Reeves. The non-human characters must think there cooler than us, and therefore think that they don't have to act, at all. Zoe McLellan is... OK, she actually fits the part. The only good acting in this movie is by Richard O'Brien (where if you streched his performance as long as others, it would probably be bad). He's only on screen for 5 minutes, but he can do no wrong. The real problem with the acting is Marlon Wayans. If you've ever played D&D you would know that no Rogue (the class closest to thief) would be that bumbling and stupid, as any Rogue that was would die really fast. If you haven't played D&D, you would know that know human as stupid as him would survive for very long. He really drags the movie down as much as he can as some pretty bad comedic sidekick.\n\nThe Script is horrible and includes so many bad things. The dialouge is some of the worst you've ever heard. The plot is explained off screen and the characters suddenly know what to do. The plot is pretty bad considering a lot of the story ideas one could find on-line.\n\nThe sets are pretty lame and look like a high school stage crew put them together. The SFX are descent, for a home computer.\n\nJoel Silver really should've picked someone with experience to direct, rather that a first timer. There are several directors that have some background in fantasy, or even horror, that could've given us something descent from the script.\n\nWith all of its faults, whenever it's on T.V, you know you're going to watch it, if only to wonder why it ever drained 6 bucks from your wallet."

This film proves that Hollywood has no respect for fantasy lovers.\n\nNor does it seem to have any respect for actors. Jeremy Irons could have been a bright spot in an otherwise rotten film, but he was poorly directed, alternating between wooden and melodramatic overacting. Narrative flow is lacking in this film, and scenes meant to be \"powerful\" or \"moving\" come across as dead and plodding. One scene which I gather was supposed to be an intimate moment between two lead characters simply lead to guffaws of laughter from the audience who had come to see this film.\n\nThis film struck me as something that has no respect for its audience, and no respect for its source material. I felt, at times, like I was watching a satire of a typical Dungeons and Dragons game. I think most of the problems lie in incompetent directing, because I know that some of the actors, like Jeremy Irons and Marlon Wayans, can actually act decently, when given good material and a good director.\n\nThere is little that is good about this movie. I had low expectations of this film, but I hadn't set them low enough.\n\nI did enjoy some of the special effects, though, particularly towards the end. But that wasn't enough to justify this film."

The plot was believable, the characters were likeable. There was even great depth of character, an element missing in many action films. I thought there was too much emphasis on the main characters and too little on the interesting supporting characters. I wouldn't call it a classic tale of good verses evil but it had a good plot and interesting characters with good interaction between them. I'm giving it a 9 out of 10 just because every one else gave it such a low rating. It would otherwise have been an 8. It wasn't perfect but it was a pleasing film (and I'm hard to please). For my fellow ex-pats looking for a VCD, the one I bought was in the jewel box inside the cardboard box claiming to be a DVD rip.

The characters were poorly crafted with little or no depth.\n\nThe plot was even thinner than the character definitions and relied on us believing that a large group of intelligent and educated people (ie the Mage's council) would be so gullible as to simply take the main bad guy at his word without any supporting evidence. And it goes down hill from that point. And as for the music building tension in a cave just as the hero discovers.....a tree. I actually laughed out loud at that point.\n\nThe special effects weren't bad but the costuming was terrible. The axe that the dwarf uses is the low point of the costumes and looks like its made out of styrofoam. There are a lot more examples of poor costuming, but I won't go into those.\n\nThe second category is as movie based on the game Dungeons and Dragons. Now I'm not a fan of the game, but I do know that they barely even paid lip service to the rules of the game.\n\nThe third category is as a movie based on role playing games in general. Its a more broad based category. One of the key elements of role playing is the social, where the characters work as a team to achieve their goals. In the movie, this never actually happened. Every time there was a challenge it was always the same character facing it on his own.\n\nAll in all, a very poor movie."

To bring a game spanning such a wide spectrum as \"Dungeons & Dragons\" to the big screen was no doubt like slaying a dragon, but this time the dragon won.\n\nThe plot centers around a sinister wizard (Irons) who seeks to control the dragons, an empress (Birch) who represents the forces of good (although her facial expression remains entirely neutral throughout) and a thief (Whalen) who gets caught in the middle. Irons and Birch are absolute polar opposites in acting styles in this film. Irons is over-the-top with mindless shouting and overacting, while Birch is nearly catatonic in every scene. It's a shame that these two fine actors couldn't breathe enough life into this shameful flick. On a side note, Irons sports a neatly trimmed 20th century hairstyle which appears ridiculously out of place on a medievil sorcerer.\n\nThis film, intended to be the first of a series, had the simple job of developing the characters in preparation for this would-be mega-franchise. Unfortunately, it didn't work, as I simply didn't care about any of them. They did make a fair attempt to play upon actual recognizable elements of the game, hoping to keep the interest of the D&D players as least, but even the somewhat impressive eye candy was less than captivating.\n\nAny number of films of this genre that followed the inception and ensuing popularity of the role-playing game could bear the name \"Dungeons & Dragons\" with considerable merit, including \"Dragonslayer\" and \"Ladyhawke\". And, of course, since the game derived much of its content from the works of Tolkien, the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" movie pales in comparison to \"The Fellowship of the Ring\"."

Dungeon masters - who should be master storytellers - usually exhibit the imagination of bricks, and run to their guide books every two seconds to check for a figure that comes from Table H in Appendix Y of the Compendium from Hell.\n\nJust thought I'd vent about that.\n\nSo, isn't it fitting that this movie adaptation is also about as imaginative as the average brick? It serves up cliches aplenty, including the Likable Thief Heroes (like in \"Conan\"), the Big Bad Wizard (why is the smart guy always the villain?), the Greedy Rapacious Dwarf (I hate friggin' dwarves) and the elegant, sagely Elves (why didn't the estate of Tolkien sue?).\n\nBest part? The old hams! Richard O'Brien is great as the Chief Thief, and Tom \"The Bomb\" Baker puts in a surprisingly dignified performance as the elven healer Halvarth. Truth be told, I only saw this movie for Tom, since he's the best Doctor from \"Doctor Who\" (a show that proves you can do good fantasy on a low budget), but alas he's only on screen for a few moments. Still, he out-acts the young cast without having to break a sweat.\n\nAmusingly, Tom is fond of complaining that Jeremy Irons is the Most Boring Actor in the Universe, so it's strange to actually see them in a movie together. Irons, who perhaps took Tom's criticisms to heart, here tries to cast off his stoic reputation but chewing up the scenery so rabidly that you expect torrents of foam to spring from his mouth. It is, quite simply, the worst performance that I've ever seen a \"classical\" actor give in a genre film; talk about miscasting! Maybe Tom is right about him after all..."

Justin Whalin (best known as Jimmy Olsen on \"Lois & Clark\") stars as a young thief who has to find some somethingorother and do somethingorother and fight some nasty baddies and rescue the cute young magic girl etc. None of this makes any sense so it's best when watching this film to simply ignore the storyline altogether and concentrate on enjoying the somewhat light and breezy action sequences. The fx are decent for this sort of thing and the end fight with all the dragons is fun to watch. GRADE: D+"

I thought to myself \"Boy, a lot of people really hated this movie. But I'm a cool guy, and I'm sure that with my ironic sense of detachment I can have fun with D&D.\" Big mistake.\n\nAlmost all of the lines had a used feel, like they were copied from other films. The only original line was the most cringe-worthy, uttered by poor Jeremy Irons \"Not so talented now, eh, Mr. Ridley?\"\n\nEditing was also poorly done, and instead of simple placement shots of building exteriors, they choose to use fancy CGI sweeps around the buildings. This was done for at least four buildings, but each sweep was so fast there was no chance to identify which building was being shown. In the fight scenes, I couldn't tell what was going on half the time because most of the shots were too tight.\n\nPlot? Bad as well. As the adventure starts, two of the main characters get sucked into a map, only to return in about five minutes of audience time. Where were they? What did they see/do? Apparently, they got some information, but that is all we ever learn.\n\nThe only parts of the movie I found enjoyable were seeing Tom Baker (the fourth Doctor) as the Elf guy (king? doctor? who knows?) and Richard O'Brien (Riff Raff) as the leader of the thieves guild.\n\nIn short, avoid this movie. It is not good, bad in a good way, or good in a bad way. It is simply bad, or bad in a bad way. 1 out of 10. Avoid!"

I'm very much paraphrasing (it was a long time ago) but the sentiment was very much to the affect of, 'We wanted to create an experience like the real D&D where you can see a girl at a bar, then just decide to go up and talk to her.'\n\nI'm not entirely sure what point he was trying to make. Perhaps that, in this magical fantasy land, you have characters that dare to interact with females? Notwithstanding this tragic and depressing notion, D&D is less than spectacular.\n\nI enjoy bad films - making those little witty asides or ad libbing banter so the people sat around you (who probably haven't yet decided they dislike the film) can laugh indulgently - but this movie is heavily sullied by the fact people probably got paid handsomely to be part of it. If the poor dialogue and woefully predictable narrative flow was the result of underfunding then it might be acceptable. But, like so many franchises with an established fanbase of desperately sex-starved movie-goers, shove in an elf with tits and it'll at least make its money back.\n\nPainful."

(How many times did we have to see the same sweep of the way cool castle) But, I thought this movie could not be worse then ZARDOS so what the heck. Boy ooh boy was I wrong. I have never seen more bad over acting, boring lead you by the nose plot, and terrible costumes in my life. With the success of Shows like XENA, I figured costumes would be worth seeing. Wrong again!! Who here thinks evil bad-ass butt kicking sword dudes should wear lipstick, raise your hand. I was glad to see very little LEATHER as thats a common trait in Hollywood. But over all it was one disappointment after another. The only redeeming quality in the film was it put many D&D rule elements into the story. BUT if you are not a gamer than you wont care about that. Could the director of this film rip off STAR WARS and Raiders of the Lost Arc more? Hell even SNAILS was JAR JAR BINKS. To everyone who hated that character, which I am not one of, watch D&D and dream of a big stupid CG effect GUNGAN. You will be happy. I stayed through the film to see the Dragons at the end. Even this was somewhat of a disappointment. There are hundreds of Dragons in the, (ho hum) epic fight, but only GOLD and RED colors? What about all the other colors in the game? Who the hell would let that worthless princess AMIDAL.. I mean what ever her name was, fly around by herself and wave a magic wand at stuff. SHEESH I know we have to suspend our disbelief but they asking too much. They tried real hard to cram as much into this movie as possible but left out one important thing, the audience.

The lurid 'special' effects are largely unconvincing and provide occasional unintentional laughs, while the script assembles every adventure movie clich\u00e9 character it can scrape up - the cowardly thief who is actually heroic under duress, the sorcerer's apprentice who wants to use magic on her own, the orphaned kid looking for revenge against the evil lord - and dishes them out amidst some of the worst dialog in movie history. The leading actors can't give useful performances thanks to incompetent direction and star Jeremy Irons doesn't even bother to try. His turn as the evil lord basically comes down to strutting about arrogantly and yelling a lot, then picking up his paycheck. The action sequences are poorly staged and come off flat, the comedy relief doesn't provide relief from anything, and the whole affair stumbles along predictably to its obvious set piece showdown and then mercifully ends. The only part of the movie that even hints that it's supposed to be a big budget spectacular is the set design work, which is actually reasonably convincing for the desired period and only makes the viewers wish they could use the sets and shoot their own better version.\n\nIt actually amazes me that with twenty years of background material and hundreds of D & D novels and game scenarios written over the years that THIS was what the producers decided to shoot. Any random writer of D & D novels, indeed any random fantasy writer at all, could have put together a more interesting story and assembled more literate dialog and more interesting characters. This was not just disappointing, it was shockingly bad. The whole project should have been aborted at the screenplay stage until a better script, better director and better cast were available."

No one appears to have mentioned it yet in these reviews, so I'll throw it out here....The Dungeons and Dragons cartoon series.\n\nYes, this is what we feared we'd be in for with this movie, and guess what? We were very disappointed. This is much, much worse than the cartoon could ever hope to be.\n\nTo a roleplayer this movie is just about as retarded as it can get. No plot, no consistency, nothing. Considering the D&D game has generated something in the region of 90,000 pages of material you'd think it would just be a case of picking a suitable scenario from the hundreds available and reworking it into a script.\n\nBut, with a writing team who've done nothing of any note and a director who apparently named his production company after Elvis Presley's mother's dog I suppose we should be grateful it wasn't much worse (although how it could possibly be any worse, escapes me).\n\nThe acting is dire to the point of being painful. Even the Kings of overacting, Richard O'Brien, Tom Baker and Bruce Payne look sad in this, though it was good to see Tom is still with us. As for Bruce Payne, he always, always, always plays the bad guy, and usually to good effect. But here, with his colourful lipstick, I couldn't help but laugh every time he was on screen, which kind of destroyed his supposed menace. I kept hoping one of the other actors would say \"Dude, what's wrong with your lips?\"\n\nOnly Jeremy Irons seemed to be having fun. His terrible overacting was on a par with (but not nearly so good as) Alan Rickman's in Robin Hood.\n\nI note from the credits also that Dave Arneson, one of the founders of the game this trash is supposed to be based on, had a cameo role in the film which was deleted. I don't know whether to cheer or cry. On the one hand it would have been nice to see him, even for just a fleeting glimpse of the man that helped create D&D. On the other, he's probably better off out of it! And why was it deleted? His acting couldn't stink any worse than the rest of the cast.\n\nThe non-human characters in the story are shamefully dealt with here, with the elves looking ridiculous and dwarfs being relegated to novelty value only. And what the hell was that three-eyed blue-headed mostrosity meant to be? Looked like it'd be more at home on Star Trek. And if I hear another pseudo-Scottish accent coming out of a dwarf....\n\nAnd then there's the big finale with lots of CGI dragons. Well, they look good....in the distance. But up close the big red dragon was about as convincing as the snake in Anaconda. I mean, it looked like it was lifted out of a bad video game.\n\nSadly, another opportunity to promote D&D has slipped by. And people who have never played the game will watch this and snigger when they think of those that do, assuming that this movie defines \"what it's all about\"\n\nThe only bright spot comes with the demise of the Wayans character, Snails. It really is a merciful release to no longer be subjected to his awful stereotypical blackman routine. On the other hand, any real spark of energy the movie has goes down with him at the same time.\n\nWhat an insult this film is to all roleplayers. And if you're not a roleplayer, it's still an insult. Avoid it."

My, my, my was I completely wrong. I sat down to watch this movie with low expectations. Usually, when I do this the movie turns out to be not so bad. This was one of those rare times when the movie winds up being worse than my already low expectations. The dialogue and the story are very poor. The acting is especially bad. Marlon Wayans and Justin Whalin had this \"cool dude, urban vibe\" that made me wonder if they hadn't just stepped out of a Teen Comedy. Jeremy Irons is a fantastic actor but he overacted this part. The only redeeming performance and character is the dwarf. You must believe me when I say that I will always sit through a movie no matter how bad. However, I wanted to stop this movie many times after about the first 30 minutes. It's really difficult to put into words what a terrible movie this was. It's a shame that this money and opportunity was wasted on bad directing, writing, and acting. If you're gonna make a fantasy movie, at least read the cream of the fantasy novel crop. I think the writers simply thumbed through the D&D Players Handbook to do their research. What a shame and what a waste of 2 hours from my life."

I noticed it a great deal right before the guy and girl kiss. Again when the main mage guy talks like he always has to bear his teeth. Another thing i can agree with is the way the movie says dungeons and dragons but really only incorporates it with dragon IN a dungeon in the beginning(and it gets killed to, poor thing!!) and in the end when we see them flying all over the place but from such a distance that they seem more like dragon flies. One thing I can say is good though is the armor. I have read that someone thinks that they think that the costumes were bought at a Wally World. I for one work at a Wal-mart while going to college and i could only wish that the costumes in the movie were sold there. The dude with lipstick's arm gauntlet alone if recreated and sold at most armor places would probably cost you over a thousand dollars which would be around the right kind of cash his type of character in the movie could afford. I know I've looked(I'm kind of an armor collector). Even the GOOD leather ones will cost you a hefty amount of cash. And with the other armors such as the girl elves breast-plate, well that in itself is what armor is, anything more would be too fancy for the movie. Not everyone in the medevil times ran around with etched breast-plates with intricate designs. So a recreation of an elf wearing this type of armor seems somewhat accurate(come on, not even a beginner on a GAME starts out with the best armor). The plot-line seems fairly good and I for one am looking forward to a sequel if they improve on the minor mistakes of the first and keep the SAME actors (Sequels always suck if you change the actors,ALWAYS!!). Because if right type directing is given to these actors they could be awesome. So dont be such downers and hope for a new and improved sequel.\n\nI give this movie a 7 out of 10.\n\nLORD OF THE RINGS ROCKS!!!"

I do not know how close that is to the original series so I can only say that I found the ideas unique and creative broken are on Playstation 1 level but still bearable most sets look cheap and the drama is reminiscent of school theater but nothing else really is terrible Marlon Wayans can be quite annoying but luckily not so long in this movie at least not until the end Jeremy Irons is super entertaining and during the movie he is almost on the level of Nicolas Cage and now and then the music is too actually pretty much what point would also be as said if it focuses only on our three main characters say the sorceress and the two thieves is actually a good trip."

On the contrary, I've done my bit of role-playing games through the years - and like most others with that interest, I've enjoyed D&D/AD&D. But not even for an established closet-nerd like me is there anything to come after here. The story SUCKS, and the acting is, if possible, even worse; it's absolutely horrible to behold the performance of otherwise solid Jeremy Irons who is overacting to an absurd degree. But hey, he got his fat pay-check, and now he's probably trying to forget this movie, as do I.\n\nThe dragons in the very end are pretty cool, but that's that. And considering the general standard of sweet-to-the eye CG effects in almost every new adventure movie these days, there isn't any logical reason to invest money in this fantasy edition of an American family sit-com.\n\nNo, if you're looking for fantasy releases, go watch \"Willow\" again, wait for the DVD special edition of \"Legend\" (out 21st May 2002), and of course run around in little circles in excitement about when the \"LOTR:FOTR\" special edition comes out!"

Somehow the film looks stagy as hell and TV drama quality level whatever talent was thrown in, did not Gel into a cohesive whole. I suggest that the majority of the problems must flow from the plot and the dialogue which is all to cheesy and clich\u00e9, the props look plastic the scene setting looks too - for cheap - television, you can almost feel the Styrofoam in it, the dwarf almost seems a sidekick for the sake of it, your not sure why he even bothered turning up, his character seems so inconsequential, the elven tracker tries to act elven serious aloof, but just comes across as wooden, in fact I better stop there as lets be honest none of the acting was compelling. Moments in which your supposed to feel something or have emotion - fall really flat, The plot and the script really must be major culprits in this film. The Elven sword givers, I couldn't even work out what was supposed to be going on there really. Waylans is alive at least, but sadly he just makes you feel he's in frat-house comedy mode, in the wrong time period. The whole thing is just plain awkward, very American takes on medieval alehouses abound etc, clich\u00e9s, but films that don't work have to be made, so that we can get a few good films at the end of the day, people have to practice to get better."

        "review_detailed_main": "I originally caught this film at the cinema during the height of my enthusiasm for the tabletop game called Dungeons & Dragons that this film shares its title with. The trailers looked interesting and, of course, the marketing made sense since this was probably Newline's build up to Lord of the Rings the following year. Maybe that left no money or creative juice for this film - what ever the reason for the sheer badness of Dungeons & Dragons, I'm profoundly grateful that Newline did not take the same approach to making Lord of the Rings.\n\nWhere to start?! The characters are really not characters at all but just archetypes and clich\u00e9s thrown together. It's a little like the laziest ever roleplaying session: here's a thief, here's a mage, here's a dwarf. What's your thief like? He's black and he steals stuff. What's the mage like? He's evil. They are like cardboard cutouts with no life or chemistry.\n\nThe plot is infantile and generic at the same time. Evil wizard wants to rule the world because of his lust for power and the characters (for lack of another word) join forces because they are there and need stuff to do. Again, this reminds me of a lazy roleplaying session. They have no motivation beyond the fact that it says so in the script. So, I was not invested in any of them and could not have cared less if they lived or died.\n\nThe acting was awful: Stiff in most cases but, as for Jeremy Irons, completely over the top. I suspect he worked with what he had in terms of script. Still, my award for cringe-worthiness goes to Bruce Payne for playing Damodar as both stiff AND over-the-top.\n\nConsidering the breath-taking visuals of Lord of the Rings only a year later, the visual effects of this film are disappointing to say the least. It has dragons even right there in its title but the ones you get to see look more like hand puppets than anything else! Costume and set designs are like cheap Xena-rip offs. Some weapons literally look like plastic toys.\n\nFinally, I was especially unhappy with how the film turned out because I had been looking forward to seeing one of my favourite games come to life. In this film (like in many game adaptations) I see no appreciation of the source material. I'll admit there are dragons and also a few dungeons in a generic high fantasy setting with elves, dwarfs and orcs. That's where any similarity ends. It was at its worst a quick cash grab with the name of a big franchise and at best an attempt to show that Newline could also do fantasy. I assume it left both fans of the game and fans of fantasy films in general dissatisfied. Recently, I found it again on Netflix but after watching some five minutes I remembered how bad it was and stopped. No need to waste another 107 minutes of my life."

        "review_detailed_main": "As a film student and avid Dungeons & Dragons (Role-playing) player I, for the most part, enjoyed this film. From a film standpoint the cinematography and editing were relatively good. The textbook shot composition worked well for this film. The film didn't require crazy camera angles or other visual eye-candy to keep the interest of the regular movie go'er. The final battle scene in the palace tower was cool with the CG dragons engaged in battle in the background. The hand to hand combat action scenes were edited with a textbook beat and rhythm to them. I also liked the point of view camera movement on each location's establishing shot. The camera would fly and pan around the CG structure, I.E. the palace, to give the viewer this location eye-candy effect. This was cool because most directors would choose to use a still stagnate shot of the exterior of the building to show each location change. Things I didn't care for much. The movie lacked in costume design and had a bit to be desired in story. One of the main antagonist characters (Damodar played by Bruce Payne) had the worst make-up design I have ever seen. The character had this blue lipstick thing going on during the entire movie. I couldn't take this character seriously with this lipstick theme going on. Not to mention the make-up was inconsistent on a few characters during the length of the entire film. I did expect the movie to be based on more of the \"Magic\" motif of the D&D role playing game. For example the female lower level mage (Marina played by Zoe McLellan) had this kickin magical power thing going for her at the beginning of the story, this made me think that she was going to be a more powerful wizard in the story and be more of a protagonist. Again her character had all this magical power at the beginning of the story but later lost it when she could have been supporting her comrades during the hand to hand combat sequences. I half expected her to jump into a battle with a fireball or some type of other useful spell. As a veteran player of the game for almost fifteen years (But yes I do admit I'm no expert) I was wondering why the wizards didn't follow the rules that Gary Gygax had written for the role playing game. For example Marina casted this spell at the beginning of the film to capture two thieves. The spell consisted of a magical rope-like force that wrapped around the two thieves. This is where I have a problem. First she is a low-level mage. So she wouldn't contain the knowledge and power to cast such a spell. Second, as far as I remember the closest lower level wizard spell that even come close to this spell she casted would maybe be \"Bind\" or \"Rope Trick\" or even \"Hold Person\". This spell she casted was nothing like any of those spells. Yes, I know I'm going to extremes here, but if your going to call your movie Dungeon and Dragons you should at least keep to the rules of the role playing game and use the spells listed in the book effectively. I'm not saying that they have totally strayed from the rules of the game. There were a few things that only veteran players would have noticed about the story. For example dwarves don't care for horses they prefer ponies. And elves are slender angelic creatures. Again I know as a filmmaker and screenwriter you have the power to change and create you own themes and spells or rules. I do want to thank the writers of this film for not making it some type of reality story where a group of real-life teens get sucked into some type of \"game porthole\" to find they are playing their game characters. That would have made for a BAD film. So as a movie viewer and D&D player I would suggest to others to view this film for themselves because I liked it."

But it wasn't really a bad movie after all. The acting was rather impressive, the storyline was good and the effects not too bad. There was a few minor things I thought were a little odd, like the dragons and beholders who seemed to have the intelligence of beasts, while normally they should be even more intelligent than humans. Also the magic seemed very powerful, with Marina being only an apprentice and casting powerful spells like portal and chain lightning. Another thing I might mention is the rip-off scenes. There's a lot of scenes you might recognize if you've seen Star Wars. Scenes like when the dragon scene in the beginning vs the rancor scene in Jabba's palace. And in the end the good guy and the bad guy fights with a blue and a red sword which flashes every time they clash together. Hmmm where have I seen that before?"

One exception is Tom Baker in a nice cameo, he knows how to play this stuff like it's for real. Otherwise, it's the 60's Batman TV show all over again."

        "review_detailed_main": "With truly horrid formations of attempts at acting, with special effects, costuming and makeup that ranged from TV-Movie to I-Can-Do-That and with a plot that is the only true Dungeon involved in the film, this was a tremendous let down both to those familiar and those unfamiliar with \"D&D\". As a familiar one, I can tell you that our 4th Grade gaming sessions displayed better improvised lines that those that came down the Hollywood gristle-mill this time. If you're unfamiliar, you could possibly just sit back and enjoy the ridiculous contortions of Jeremy Irons and Bruce Payne, who seem to be intent on screwing enormous amount of absurdity out of every hackneyed line (50% prediction rate, I guarantee you, try it). Also easily identifiable are scenes stolen from Lucas movies, of which I could identify about 7 or so. Justin Whalin does about as well as any Backstreet Boy in his attempts at heroism and thespianism. Zoe McLellan and Thora Birch are easy on the eyes, hard on the film sensibilities, and have a penchant for acquiring Renaissance Fair-yet-GAP-like outfits for inappropriate settings. What wonderful stereotypes to include in a medieval setting! Kristen Wilson, geared for battle in a push-up bra that could put an eye out, has the duty, along with every other \"elf\" character in the film, of making contradictory, ridiculous, off-hand remarks about what was \"meant-to-be\". The fight scenes are mildly fun, and so, interestingly enough, is the work of Marlan Wayans. Episode I and this movie both sucked, but this one was so terrible you stopped trying and watched some of the offered clowning, which was, indeed, much better than Jar-Jar offered. In fact, Wayans' character could be the only one you could accuse of having a \"personality\". Even the old rule about bad-guy being good in bad action movies is violated here; Payne and Irons seem to have trouble separating who is the \"smart guy\" and who is the \"tough guy\". Unless, of course, the rule applies to Richard O'Brien, who pimps out a nice Thief Guildmaster into yet another film-not-as-good-as-Rocky-Horror. All-in-all, don't go unless you can enjoy being disgusted, and have a theatre full of like-minded highbrows who won't care when you shout \"Snails...He's My Father!\" during the Ewok-City ripoff scene...."

They weren't so spectacular that they directed the course of the movie; they did, however, leave something to the imagination, and encouraged the suspension of disbelief (which I personally think is a quality lacking in cinema these days). The cameo appearances were fantastic; Richard O'Brien was spectacular as Xilas, Guildmaster of Thieves. This role had some similarity to his part as Cosmo Nation in the film \"Shock Treatment,\" with the maze, and... well, I won't spoil it.

There is no way that any sane mind could consider this nearly as good as the Princess Bride, Highlander, or Excalibur. This movie had no plot worth speaking of, no acting skills demonstrated (even from Jeremy Irons!), and no real entertainment value. What made me really mad was the complete lack of relevance to the game on which it was based! I remember only two references to the classic game, which seems to be in contrast to the desires of the target audience.\n\nThere are not many quality sword and sorcery movie made these days, so see it to fill your need for the genre. However, for this type of movie there was almost no swordplay to speak of. The only worthwhile part was the CGI dragons, and there wasn't enough of that.\n\nI honestly came out of this movie wondering if it placed in my top 10 worst movies I have ever seen. I'm not sure, but its in the running. I rate it a 2.5 or so out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Promising trailer, bad film. You can tell that first time director Courtney Solomon blew most of his budget on the odd bit of special effects and as such had to cut a lot of important scenes from the film. As a result what is left looks like a rather pointless adventure of one man who is accompanied by a group of rather pathetic hangers on that do nothing throughout. One character, a dwarven warrior has almost all his scenes cut leaving you wondering why they bothered with him in the first place.\n\nSome nice scenes of dragons and a passing beholder (who does nothing but float past) doesn't make up for the rest of the film. The acting is pretty terrible even from Jeremy Irons, who you would generally expect a lot better from. Instead he seemed quite uncomfortable in his role, and constantly over acted. The only people that seemed at all comfortable in their roles were Justin Whalin (Most would know from the Superman TV series) and Richard O'Brien (playing himself pretty much). A better choice for the evil mage would have been David Warner (who did the voice of Irenicus in Baldurs Gate 2, and has always been a superb bad guy in this genre of film). Also choosing an experienced fantasy film director rather then a novice would have helped. They could still have people on hand to make sure the film stayed accurate to the D&D world.\n\nI hope that in the future another better film will be produced set in the D&D universe as there is so much potential in there. Perhaps after the Lord of the rings film has been released interest will be ripe again for this genre. We can only hope. You never know, someone may even make a Baldurs Gate film!\n\nThe extra material on the DVD explains a lot of what you miss (and is quite laughable for the cardboard cut out wraith, and the inflatable baby dragon...but you need to see it really to understand).\n\nIn summary, if you love d&d don't bother with this film, instead buy the new 3rd edition rules and get playing instead!"

I am a long time fan of D&D and things related, and seeing the previews, was actually quite expectant.\n\nWow was I disappointed.\n\nThis movie was bad, bad, bad. Where can one begin?\n\nThe plot? About as substantial as a sheet of toilet paper, and not quite as entertaining. There was no backstory for any of the characters or events... though this might have spared viewers more of the horrible acting.\n\nThe special effects? Well, they were adequate for the budget. Considering everything else, however, they got old fast.\n\nThe writing? This was written by a group of guys who thought \"gee this would be neat\" and since they had investors and signed the paychecks everyone else agreed. Bad move. There was more garbage dialogue here than in a John Madden telethon.\n\nThe acting? Ahhh... we come to the acting. What can one say when Marlan Wayans is the best actor in the film? He's not that good, don't fool yourself... rather everyone else is just that bad. The acting was on a line with poorly put together community theater. Someone paid these people for this when they could have saved more money for better special effects raiding a local high school or SCA event. Aweful, bad, naughty, evil acting.\n\nTo sum it up... this movie I think even negated itself from having potential. It was kind of like Twister, except without Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt to carry the acting (yes... that bad). Save your money and let a delusional friend rent it before you watch."

It wasn't a great tale at all.. and in actual fact, the story sucked a whole bunch. Well, not so much the story because I found that to be quite interesting. The script is what sucked. Bad lines with some equally bad acting. That doesn't go for all the characters though. Justin Whalin (Ridley) did a great job in his lead role and with the fight scenes. I really enjoyed The Wayans Brother (It doesn't really matter which one does it?... okay, okay... Marlon) as Snails because he added some great comic relief to an already cheezy film. I also liked Kristen Wilson as the Elf.. but only because she really looked like an Elf.\n\nOn the other hand, I didn't think that Thora Birch (Empress Savina) suited the role (and I personally can't believe she went from American Beauty to this... goodness) and Jeremy Irons (Profion) overacted the whole time. I also think that one of the mages were from Brooklyn. If you watch it, listen to his accent.\n\nThe special effects were OBVIOUS computer animations and the script was bad. Let alone that, half the actors sucked emensly. When you get through all of that.. you have an enjoyable movie... but only if you know anything about D & D."

The average drunken, tabacco-fueled gaming sessionof my youth and early adult life, usually filled with lewd comments about female characters and the occasional pointless suicide of a freinds character were filled with better story points and acting than this.\n\nFor anyone that had anything ggood to say about this movie, all i can say is that i would never trust you to pick a movie for me to watch. Or what food to eat for that matter (cmon, it tastes just like chicken. ill just wipe it off......)\n\nIt almost completely killed all hope for any RPG based movies in the future. Sure. Vidoe-game movies typically suck, but tomraider did well (it wasnt very good, but it sold tickets), and Resident Evil was a good movie, even without its great ancestry.\n\nBut even video games are more \"mainstream\" than roleplaying games.\n\nThe support for this kind of movie to be made is very low, and when one is made this bad, the support for more will probably be nonexistant. I blame it for the fact that many good movies will most likely go unmade because it set a terrible standard for it's genre."

Considering the script he had to work with he did a decent performance, even though he sometimes looked like he had to keep himself from laughing.\n\nWhy I laugh to hate this movie is the same reason why I hate many comic and comic-like movies: They are always much dumber than the original. This means that many who don't know otherwise and see this kind of movie will think that the comics, or in this case the roleplaying gamers, are infantile children who don't grasp the concept of logic and use stupid language.\n\nSo, I don't think I completely wasted my time watching this, but only because didn't expect much to begin with."

The 'general public' will be totally mixed - the FX lovers will enjoy it, the 'drama-lovers' and cutesy Meg Ryan Tom Hanks comedy romance might as well not go.\n\nSo how was the movie? If you have been waiting for a movie with a good deal of magic and an effects budget to support it, then D&D is your flick. If you don't mind straying from the D&D paradigm where every type of player is restricted to a strict set of rules (theives can't use swords, etc) and take this movie as \"fantasy with great FX\" - you'll very likely enjoy it.\n\nIf the movie looked too slapstick to be fantasy (via the Waylon brother), don't be too hasty. Yes, Marlon was the comic relief portion, but it comes off VERY well; never overdone. Marlon did a very good job. If you thought of him as Jar Jar Binks, relax; he's not. You may be surprised.\n\nIf you are looking to compare the movie to other movies (like others here seem to want to) leave that at home. There isn't anything original in film anymore, so get over it. Is the Emporess like Queen Amadala? Let's see .. they are both young and in power... sheeze, give me a break. If anything, the Emporess does a better job in her position of power than Amadala does. Oh, yes, there will be other comparisons - Indiana Jones, Star Wars, etc. Seems funny that people fall back on the \"it imitates too many other movies\" excuse when they want to complain and can't do it intelligently.\n\nIn short, if you are remotely interested in this film, MAKE YOUR OWN OPINION. If you are looking to compare it to the D&D game, other movies, etc. - don't go - you won't like it."

It steals from a bunch of other movies without even doing it well, I really had a hard time with the dialogue and the heavy handed message about democracy. It even has a weird reference to the talented Mr Ripley which makes no sense. Shorty from Scary Movie also appears to have been randomly inserted into the story. So many moments in fact are laugh out loud hilarious."

        "review_detailed_main": "When this movie opened at the cinema, it got some truly awful reviews. As an avid D&D player and fan, I took great offence. I thought it was the typical case of highbrow, arty-farty movie reviewers who hate everything that isn't a foreign art film not being able to appreciate a fantasy movie. And then I saw it. Every poor review had been correct - in fact, they had been downright generous. This film was destined to be an underground cult movie for D&D fans, but instead of writing it as such, it was written to have a \"broader\" appeal. It fails on all counts. The storyline was pathetic (an episode of Hercules or Xena would have more twists and nuances), all of the characters are just plain awful - with no personality or depth whatsoever, and even the special effects are terrible. The performance of Justin Whalin as Ridley Freeborn is especially painful. Even Thora Birch (whom I adore) delivers a poor performance; but then again, she isn't given much to work with. On a more geeky level, this movie didn't even resemble D&D (the role-playing game), it was just a generic fantasy film. Nothing which makes the game unique was faithfully represented in this movie. The scenes at the tavern and the thieves guild looked more like the Cantina scene from Star Wars than a glimpse into the established fantasy realms of D&D. If it didn't bear the name Dungeons & Dragons, and was released back in the same era that spawned such campy classics as Beastmaster, Sword and the Sorceror, and Hawk the Slayer, then I might have enjoyed it as a bit of harmless fluff. But to be the end result of the long awaited movie adaptation of the role-playing game, it failed miserably. The team that inflicted this monstrosity upon us should look to movies like Willow, Dragonslayer and Lord of the Rings, and then hang their heads in shame. I can't recommend this film on any level, except possibly as a kids movie, and even then I could think of about 100 better movies to recommend for children."

Ok, the plot is more than weak and when it comes to the dwarfs axe, well... On the other hand, the acting is not bad, in many cases even good. As a long time RPG player, I have to admit that D&D wise the movie didnt care too much about the rules, but if it had (as another reviewer said before) the movie had to be rated 18+. Plus, the movie obviously was meant to be fast paced. If the mages had to rest every 5 minutes to memorize some spells, I fear that would have slowed down the whole thing too much. Lets face it, its a movie and as such simply can not include all that makes a rpg-session so much fun. Thats the same as with movies based on books. The CGIs are above average and very well used. Its not really a D&D movie, \"just\" a fantasy movie. But still, has there been anything since Conan that was anything near RPG? So although its not really great, I am happy with the movie and even it has its flaws, I can recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy movies. And, hell, like it or not, its a whole lot better than SW Episode 1 ;-) (which I hate, hate, hate! shame on you, George!)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Dungeons & Dragons seems to be a film beyond its means. The effects are too heavy handed, the landscape and setting underused. A few more countryside shots and a few less zooming up the building shots would have saved expense and added greatly to the sense of 'being there'. Combined with the television-inspired over-the-shoulder shots and the fact that it was shot entirely too close to portray the proper 'expansiveness' required for a fantasy epic leaves it feeling more like an episode of Hercules or Xena. If a lighter hand had been taken with the fantasy elements, it would have been a much more engrossing film. Oh, and what's with that blue lipstick? God in heaven...\n\nThe film isn't without its good points. The thieves are played well, but the supporting roles don't quite rise above the over-the-top dialog they're given. The storyline is reasonable, but there are undoubtedly scenes that were cut that would have made the movie make much more sense.\n\nI have a feeling that Lord of the Rings is going to come out next year and revitalize the fantasy genre. Once that happens D&D will just be one of the movies 'before Lord of the Rings'.\n\nIt's a pity that they didn't try and make a story-driven film instead of an effects driven film. The lower budget wouldn't have hurt a film that didn't rely so much on its effects shots to please. I just fear that this movie will bomb and other studios will take it as a sign that fantasy films, and indeed D&D related productions aren't worth making.\n\nThe bottom line? Not a bad movie to watch if there's nothing else on, but if you're really looking for a great fantasy epic, look elsewhere."

The big things about this movie are its special effects and its cast of fine actors and actresses, at least that's what they want us to believe. The special effects are downright terrible. I have seen video games with better graphics. The acting is worse. Did Thora Birch and Jeremy Irons sell their soul to the devil and this is what he made them do? I was actually astounded by the acting and I laughed for hours while I was in the theatre and when I left. Could a movie that has bad special effects, bad acting, and a bad script still be good? Well, probably no. The other things about this are the poor directing skill of Solomon in this movie. Whenever the band of heroes go somewhere we are treated to a cheesy cg flyby of the location. Where is the adventure? I remember some of the shots from other fantasy movies where they actually made us believe we were in a distant world, in Dungeons and Dragons we have none of this. Not for one second was I inspired by the special effects and photography as in other fantasy films. Courtney Solomon, the director, said in an article that he wants this to be a fun movie for people to enjoy, well, Solomon, the movie has to be good and believable to be fun. Fans of the games will be greatly disappointed with this. I guess I will have to put my money with Peter Jackson and Lord of the Rings. * out of **** Stars for this shameful movie."

Further, the magic was unimaginative and played no role in the film except to escape trouble. But the greatest disappointment is the dragons which are nothing more than props.

The plot doesn't make much sense -- it's as if the cast is really deciding at the moment what they are going to do next (which is one of the charms of the game, but it doesn't make for a good movie). Also, the acting is sadly on a par with that of your friends gathered in someone's living room on a Saturday night; the dialogue sounds perfunctorily expository rather than being remotely natural (even on the scale of a Star Wars movie). And what was Jeremy Irons doing in this movie? I bet he fired his agent immediately afterward.\n\nThe movie might have been far better if the director were experienced and the people involved hadn't been enthusiasts of the game.

Someone needs to inform Bruce Payne that he is not, nor will he ever be, Ray Park. Someone needs to inform Zoe McClellan that she ain't Madonna, and should leave the anatomically correct breastplates somewhere else.

Someone needs to point Danny Braet (head of visual effects) and the rest of the special effects department towards little-known films like \"Dragonheart\" and \"Jurassic Park\" to see how reptiles are well-represented by special effects. Someone -really- needs to get a clue as to script consistency (as in, differing effects from the same causing spell... why does the spell-passage stay open on the receiving end in one case, yet close in between arrivals in another?) and relative plausibility (if the bloody antagonist can control beholders, what the hell is he doing bothering with dragons?!?). Finally, someone needs to track down the director, shoot him dead, dismember him, and bury the parts in widely scattered unmarked graves.\n\nOn the other hand, Lee Arenberg did a solid job with the material he was given.

At Wizards of the Coast work many many people and I am sure that 99% of those people (even the receptionist or janitor) could provide a better script than this. The writers and director leave some major gaps in the story line, which follows largely the line of a large Xena-episode. What happens when Ridley disappears in the map? Why does the Elven-race help the humans while they are responsible for destroying the magic force of which the Elven are a part? These are some small things which could have easily been solved. And a lot of scenes looked like Star Wars?? The acting of Jeremy Irons was a little bit overdone, while this man is one of the greatest actors (\"He can sound a menu-card like Shakespeare\"). The young actors were good, and they show some hope for the future. The effects were also good, compared to the budget.

        "review_detailed_main": "I am a fan of D&D. Been playing since 1980. Looked forward for decades to the movie promised. And then we got this trash.\n\nJeremy Irons, normally a good actor, was terrible. He overacted like he was channeling William Shatner.\n\nThe Wayans brother was even worse. He was so bad the audience cheered in the theater when he died. Actually cheered.\n\nThe blue people don't match anything that was in the game at that time, and the monsters were misrepresented or just wrong. People will say, \"Well, it's a movie\" but lets be honest- this was supposed to be for the fans, and hopefully attract their friends and family, too.\n\nJustin Whalen is the noisiest thief to still be alive, but he was good in the role.\n\nThe one highlight was the cameo of Tom Baker! The second attempt was much better. Skip this one and go to the second. Unrelated, for the most part."

        "review_detailed_main": "No one is saying that this film is perfect, and by any measure the 2023 D&D film is technically better on multiple fronts, but there is one front upon which this film is superior.\n\nIf you want to watch a fantasy film that is based in the world of D&D, 2023 is superior but if you want to watch a film that feels like it is someone's D&D game broadcast on the big screen? This is the film for you.\n\nWe've got everything you want in a Lets Play, an unbalanced party that doesn't make sense, where the story ties in to one characters background, you've got a plot that hinges on the party succeeding so the bad guy can progress.\n\nThis film is not a fantasy film, it is a film based on someone's game played out by big actors.\n\nAnd though I know I am biased when I say it is a 10 to me, it deserves way more than the 3.6 it currently has."

        "review_detailed_main": "Yes, it's true. \"Dungeons and Dragons\" was a movie that was overhyped for what it was. What was it? A huge spectacle attempting to shed illumination on the mystery known as Dungeons and Dragons.\n\nEven at that it failed. The opening sequence was amazing, and had set me up for a great movie. I distinctly remember hearing myself say \"wow!\" at the detail of the city. The wow!'s ended there however.\n\nThe choice of actors was very poor and the setting was more of an amateur D&D campaign then a campaign we would've all loved to have read about. Being a fan of the books, I much rather would have had Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman write the script and have us follow the characters we all know and love, rather than follow these characters that I loathe.\n\nThe plot development is very poor. Right from beginning you know what the antagonists want. Through the movie the characters develop poorly and make changes that are way out of their class. ie: A thief wielding a long sword. Granted this is possible in instances, but throughout the movie he refers to himself as a thief and we get no insight into his past that would show any training as anything more.\n\nThe name Dungeons and Dragons, the 3d imaging at the beginning of the movie, and the music score are the only things that brought this movie up from its rating of a 3 to a 6. I reserve 1's and 2's only for the most craptacular (Long live PCXL!) movies."
