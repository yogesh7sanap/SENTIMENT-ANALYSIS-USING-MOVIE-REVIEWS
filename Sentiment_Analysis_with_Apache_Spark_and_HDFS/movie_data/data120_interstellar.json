I was struck by it. Totally got me. And it stil does, 7 years later. This is the best movie ever made for me. Because of the feeling it gives me, no other movie can. So hard to get all of this emotion in only one movie. Brilliant."

I kind of would have loved to have watched this on an IMAX screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It's just amazing, what Nolan has put on screen here. It's not only the visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way), it's the story/ride you take with it. It might be clear to some earlier than to others, where it's heading (no pun intended), but it doesn't change the fact that it's beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time.\n\nGoing out and saying this will be considered a classic, might not be too far stretched, but you still can never predict those things. The deserved love the movie gets on IMDb and other places would be an indicator that this will ring true though. The acting is really good, but I can understand if some people have issues with the ending. But the movie had to end in one way or another. It's the best possible way this could go, even if it's not in our grasps just yet ..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Interstellar is a movie like no other. Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us.\n\nNot everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earth\u2014crops and humans.\n\nFarming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous. Cooper (McConaughey) remains one of the few survivors who still appreciates the need for engineering. He feels like a man lost in time, until he stumbles into the headquarters of NASA (which had been operating in secret due to public disapproval). Here he meets others who realize that a return to our old ways is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to our demise. We need technology to save us. As Michael Caine, playing the brilliant (duh!) Professor Brand, eloquently tells Cooper, \"we were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it.\" For a movie that won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects (and deservedly so) the sound stole the show. Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy) unleashed a performance that was, quite appropriately, out of this world. Never have I seen a movie elevated so much by its score. The sound literally took my breath away. Forgive me for the next paragraph. I will gush irresponsibly about the magic that is this movie's sound. Skip it if you please. You have your warning.\n\nThe music fueled every important scene. In every meaningful moment Zimmer's harmonies captivated watchers' attention in the way of a coach commanding a locker room with a pregame speech. The music elucidated those emotional scenes, particularly ones featuring Cooper and his daughter, in a way that no words or visual ques possibly could. I sat frozen, jaw agape, with tears pouring down my cheeks as the music completely overwhelmed my emotions. The sound penetrated my soul and reverberated through my body, flowing to my appendages, supplying me with life like a heartbeat pumping blood through my veins. The music was truly the life force of movie.\n\nYes, we all witnessed a visual triumph, a daring creative wonder the likes of which we haven't encountered since Inception. Yes, nearly every actor's performance proved worthy of commendation. McConaughey is on fire. Chastain is blossoming into a star. At this point Michael Cain exudes such knowledge and wisdom by merely appearing on screen that if he were cast as Albert Einstein, people would wonder if the role were beneath him. All this considered, and the sound still towered over everything.\n\nI walked out of the theater believing that I had experienced something unique, something truly special. Interstellar inspires, it awes, and above all it entertains. I cannot ask for more than that."

The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. Not like Einstein stuff though. I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a Nolan fan or not. I give this movie a rating of 97 out of 100."

Being old enough, and lucky enough to have watched the premiere of 2001 A Space Odyssey - and viewed it several times since - of course I made comparisons, and there were a few, but this movie tells an excellent stand alone story that is both riveting and believable. I'm not going to give away any secrets but anyone who watches the last five minutes or so without a lump in their throat and a tear in their eye, well you're a critic, you're not enjoying the movie because you're too busy looking for bloopers and faults.

        "review_detailed_main": "I will keep this short for the sake of not spoiling anything.\n\nRight off i should say I love Nolan. I adore most of his movies, and Interstellar is no exception. It is a marvelous piece of work whose visuals will be hard to forget. His shots of space and the way he played with colors is rather masterful. Maybe i expected it to be greater than what i saw, but even though i was moved by the movie i did not quite feel like he created something great with 'Interstellar.' This could be attributed maybe to his overuse of sentimentalism in the father-daughter relationship he creates. Nolan really tries to make you cry with this one. I have never seen him use such powerful emotions in his movies; however that is not necessarily a good thing for this movie, given that he uses his time trying to develop a family relationship at the expense of flow and congruency. Again, the Visuals are completely off the charts. The visual imagery is truly beautiful and something that Nolan has always excelled at. Given that the most visually stunning movie in recent years, Gravity, recently came out, Interstellar does not lag behind and shows you a spectacle of Visual effects.He will most likely win Visual effects at the Oscars. The Hans's score is marvelous and will most likely earn an Oscar nomination. Matthew Mcconaughey's acting is good, but nothing stellar, especially coming off the best acting role of his career. He plays the character like it should be played, but Nolan's characters never being truly drawn out or rounded does not help him any.The same can be said for the rest of the cast. The little girl was marvelous though. I do not want to reveal any piece of the story whatsoever, but i have to say, it is one of the most original scripts i've ever seen.\n\nUltimately this movie is entertaining. There is no way Nolan can miss that. Another great thing that Nolan excels at is INSPIRING. By the time the credits rolled and people walked out, I sat there still in awe at the strong sense of human will the movie conveys. Personally, I don't think this is Nolan's best. I believe Memento stands as his masterpiece. But with Nolan, everyone has their own favorite movie. Maybe for some, Interstellar will be their favorite movie, for it is really Nolan's most ambitious and visually-striking work.\n\nBy the way, Anyone else who even tries to compare Interstellar to \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" is out of their mind. Kubrick's mission was to create art. Nolan in \"Interstellar\" sets to awe and inspire its audiences. It is truly a great piece of work."

In a time where trailers are omnipresent and going to the movies without having seen one seems unreasonable, outright stupid to some i had the magical chance to find myself in front of the IMAX on a cold November night with 2 tickets to Interstellar. My only knowledge was that Nolan directed it and McConaughey stars in it.\n\nThe images were brilliant the acting was top notch and everything was blended together by Hans Zimmer and his Music. 169 minutes flew by me with my eyes fixed on the screen and my heart racing. And there it was.. The ending. I couldn't believe it . I was reliving, rethinking the movie while the credit scenes rolled enjoying the moment, the smell of popcorn, my comfortable seat and what do i see next to me? Ninety percent of the people in the cinema rushing outside after the first second of the credit scenes.\n\n..\n\n.\n\nWell apparently people enjoy movies different than i do.

        "review_detailed_main": "It's difficult to put into words how powerful this film is. In fact, I'd go as far to say as this is so much more than just a film. After watching this, you somehow feel as if you've experienced a whole lifetime in a mere 3 hours. There isn't a single moment that goes unwasted; everything is purposeful.\n\nThis is a sci-fi film in which the 'fi' part enables the film to convery so many powerful messages. It puts just the right amout of focus on science without trying too hard to explain or prove itself. To me, one of the most powerful effects this film has left me with is the concept of impermanence. Our time on this world is finite and we should cherish and embrace it as much as we can. The film also fiddles with the concept of time and uses it as an integral part of the plot. But perhaps the most powerful message of this film is of the human condition. Yes, as humans we have our shortcomings. But we can also show remarkable empathy, dedication and ingenuity.\n\nI would be lying if I said I wasn't highly emotional while watching this film. In fact, I found myself breaking into tears several times throughout the film. I know this review wasn't very analytical - I will say the following though: this film is so immersive and well done that you forget you're watching a film. The acting is simply superb and believable at all times. Reviewing this without talking about the audio and the music would be a great disservice. The film is accompanied by one of the most brilliant soundtracks. From a composition perspective, it might seem that there isn't a lot going on in the music. But the power of the soundtrack is in its simplicity and the emotions it manages to evoke.\n\nI will end this review by saying that I truly think this film has made me a better person in some sense. It reminded me of how powerful humans can be, and how we should use our finite time on this planet to care and be empathic towards each other and our planet."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have been a cinema lover for years, read a lot of reviews on IMDb and everywhere, and never found the right movie to write my first review. I always thought I would wait for THE movie.\n\nAnd this is IT!\n\nWhen I first heard that Nolan was preparing a sci-fi movie, I felt like a kid again, waiting for his Christmas gift under the tree. I knew it would become a classic. And I'm sure it will.\n\nFirst of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of 2001 A Space Odyssey (actually many things will probably remind you of this movie). We can feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way.\n\nThe sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are.\n\nThese two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning atmosphere. You will forget you are in a movie theater, and you will be lost in space, sucked into the adventures of this new Space Odyssey, begging for more. It is a truly unique experience. I can say that I have never felt something like that in a movie theater (at least not for the past ten years).\n\nThen, of course, the cast. First of all, Matthew McConaughey. I discovered this actor in Tropic Thunder, but he didn't really convince me, though he was quite funny. Then I saw Dallas Buyers Club. Since that movie, I love him. In this movie... Well, he is the movie. I exaggerate a bit, since there are other great actors (some even unexpected with a special guest) who play extremely well. But he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest, I will call him \"X\". His role, which could be seen as a minor role, is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see.\n\nAnd finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. From what I heard, he worked with a physicist (in gravitational physics and astrophysics) to help him with that movie. And we can feel and see it. During the fifties, Asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction. Lucas and Kubrick did the same in cinema. Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet).\n\nWhy? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us.\n\nBecause, in spite of all the sci-fi aspect, it is a story about humanity. McConaughey, Hathaway, and mainly \"X\", will managed to convince you about that.\n\nMy rating for this movie can only be a 10, because in itself, it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. It IS a classic. Those who say \"we can't compare this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey, nor can we compare Nolan to Kubrick\" are wrong. We can, and we should. Talented people don't live only in the past, some genius live today, among us. And Nolan is one of them. Many say that he is overrated. I truly don't think so. Only time will answer that.\n\nThis is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made. Just go for it, without a second thought."

        "review_title": "Interstellar : An open-hearted & mastered Human Odyssey",
        "review_detailed_main": "The film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions: men overexploited land resources, which is why the only goal they have left is to survive. This life is not enough for Cooper, brilliantly played by McConaughey who gave body and soul to this character. But all of this wouldn't hold without the total control of Christopher Nolan, based on the languishing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, the luminous and impenetrable photography of Hoyte Van Hoytema, and the sincerity of Nolan's directing. He manages to film the characters and to find the right cut at the right time, always in harmony with Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, to give the film an aspiring and inspiring dimension that went missing for many many years. Thus we are transported into the same cockpit that Cooper, we feel the same remorse that he can already feel, we feel the same gravity, and we feel the same fear of the unknown melted with the force of his will. All of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice, which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film: to directly jump from when Cooper leaves in his truck, leaving his family behind him, to Endurance taking off. This simple editing decision allows Nolan to give an original movement to his film, and the musical crescendo makes us physically feel the sentimental break between two parts of the film.\n\nYou don't necessarily have to understand it immediately : The film will raise questions in you, such as : what is it to be a human being, is there some physical limitations to our humanity, how far could we be willing to go to determine knowledge, is there other dimensions that we can not access to, and above all: what is the nature of this intact and immutable bond that unites us to others wherever we are in the universe ? Is this bond only intelligible, or is it also tangible ? All these questions resonate in harmony in Nolan's Interstellar.\n\nInterstellar is itself a crescendo, increasing sensitivity and creativity. I use the term deliberately because it goes crescendo with the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, which is one of the most beautiful music ever scored for a sci-fi movie. We are witnessing a perfect musical arrangement, a total symbiosis, a bit like the music of Gravity which had understood very well how to match the image and the rhythm of a sequence to its own musicality. Zimmer's crescendos are giving a new powerful breath to every new scene, whether it is in visually powerful & intense moments or in more intimate moments; it intrudes into our momentary feelings and sensations, and manages to extend them, sometimes almost to choking, before resting on the balance of the film frame along with our mind spell-bounded.\n\nI have seen all the talent of the director that I knew he was outside the norm, but whom I did not know his capacity to reinvent itself. Because this is it: Interstellar is not an action movie, not really a blockbuster, and it goes not entirely but mostly again the expectations of common people. It's much more than that. This is much more than just a sci-fi movie. It is unlike any of his previous films. Some hoped to see Interstellar as Christopher Nolan's best film, and they were disappointed that this was not the case. And indeed, THIS IS NOT THE BEST FILM of Christopher Nolan. Because in a way, IT IS HIS FIRST FILM. I'm not saying that Interstellar is not as good as his other films, it goes beyond all of them. But to me Interstellar is the first film of a new stage in Nolan's filmography ; it is a masterpiece as it the beginning of a work ahead. Interstellar is the proof that Nolan has finally managed, despite all the expectations that were placed on him after the success of The Dark Knight, to move away from his own reputation to create a personal work, original, humble, sincere and deeply, meticulously, measured.\n\nNow, in this third act of the film, it all comes to life with unparalleled strength. Nolan poses and answers questions that raise others. But he focuses his attention on the great mystery of love, that emotional bond that can unite men and sometimes separate them. But Nolan is the only one that can successfully speak of love from a being to another in a film that mainly takes place in a another galaxy. From my point of view, only Solaris by Steven Soderbergh (2002), unfortunately neglected by the audience, was able to accomplish that. Interstellar is based on a premise which is the following : from terrestrial dust to the depths of space and time, we can never be separated from who we are as individuals and as a species, as we always leave a part of ourselves \"behind\" us. In other words, I could say that this is a human story, and even if we go as far as we want to, if we travel through the universe believing that we can be detached of the one we are fond of, we will only get closer to them. Because the separation, and thus the distance and time, can only ultimately reinforce the relationship between the people who really love each other. Because it is going to the end of the world, when we reach the end of ourselves, that we reach the singularity of the \"black hole beyond the horizon\" * : it is our humanity. No, I wasn't been able to find any bad flaws in the film. Not one, and I'm still looking. After all, Interstellar is like gravity, \"all it takes is a little push ! \"\n\n*you'll have to see the movie to figure that one out.\n\nF\u00e9lix Tardieu, November 1st, 2014"

There were allegedly issues with he sound in theaters, and any number of other issues. Then, when we get to the Oscars, the film gets nominations in the technical fields but not in the top honors.\n\nThis was wrong. Maybe this is not the best role from Matthew McConaughey or Anne Hathaway. Though, the fact that a \"Hathaway hater\" like myself enjoyed it should say something.

        "review_detailed_main": "(This is both a review of the film, and an assertion of Christopher Nolan's filmmaking style)\n\nThere have been many reviewers and critics alike that have high praise for the film (the visual effects, the acting, the music), but say how it's not Christopher Nolan's best directed film. This is where i personally would have to disagree. Before i get into it, though, i'll talk about Interstellar a bit.\n\nInterstellar is truly a sci-fi epic like no other. To compare said film to '2001: A Space Odyssey' isn't just a disservice, but unnecessary. The films are almost nothing alike, simply sharing small plot elements. Also, Stanley Kubrick's vision of Arthur C. Clarke's sci-fi epic wasn't to ponder the philosophical questions that accompanied the story, but to make art, and art is was, and is. With Interstellar, Mr. Nolan set out to make his most personal and emotional film to date about love and time (time being a recurring theme throughout all of Nolan's films). But it's so much more than that too. There are no words to express the epic journey Nolan takes us on in the film, but needless to say, it's tear-jerking and emotional throughout. The acting is top-notch, especially McConaughey, who gives (I would say) his most emotional performance yet. But the actor who stole the show in a few scenes (one in particular, when they're on an alien planet) was David Gyasi as Romilly, one of the astronauts aboard the Endurance, their spacecraft. The musical score from Hans Zimmer is, without a doubt, his best and most influential work to date, helping drive the film's bold and breath-taking vision (the church organ helped significantly). The visual effects are easily the best to date as well, and of the year. To see a black hole created through visual effects in such a way, with pages theoretical equations provided by Kip Thorne (theoretical physicist, of whom's work inspired the film's genesis); what you see in the film is the most realistic depiction of a black hole, and even offered new insight to accretion discs surrounding the anomalies. But even everything else, from the alien planets to the Endurance, the visuals always look real. Then, there's the writing. I would definitely have to say this has some of the best dialogue i've ever heard in a sci-fi movie, and the script continually pours or oozes emotion, keeping the audience tethered to the film.\n\nNow, about Mr. Nolan. Don't just look at Nolan, but look at his films. Some say Inception would be his masterpiece, while others would say it's The Dark Knight, or Memento. But honestly, every single film Christopher Nolan has directed is a masterpiece not of its genre, but of Nolan. Following is his quiet masterpiece, not the film that put Mr. Nolan on the map as a phenomenal director, but one people visited or revisited after becoming accustomed to Nolan, after seeing Memento, what could be called his breakout masterpiece. Then, right after, he directed the remake of the Norwegian thriller, Insomnia. This, too, could be considered a masterpiece, even if a remake. Then, we were given his take on the Batman universe, starting with Batman Begins, the origin masterpiece. Then, there's The Prestige, adapted from the novel of the same name, which can be called his dark masterpiece. The Dark Knight, his bold masterpiece; Inception, his complex masterpiece, and The Dark Knight Rises, his flawed masterpiece. Now, we have Interstellar, his emotional or personal masterpiece.\n\nThis is just my looking at Nolan and his films, but whatever your thoughts are, you can't deny Interstellar is one hell of a journey. He certainly is one of the best filmmakers of our time, and of all time. I can't wait to see what he does next, but i'm not sure it will be as emotionally powerful as Interstellar."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Interstellar' was incredible. The visuals, the score, the acting, were all amazing. The plot is definitely one of the most original I've seen in a while. Most of the critic reviews have said that some bits are a little too unbelievable, but I have to disagree. Yes, there were some parts that were definitely in the \"fi\" part of sci-fi. But the thing is, 'Interstellar' deals with concepts that we know very little about. We have no idea what the 4th or 5th dimension is like, or what it would be like to go through a wormhole or a black hole. I don't think it's fair to call something unbelievable, when we have absolutely no idea what WOULD be believable in those circumstances. Either way, excellent writing from the Nolan brothers. The visuals were outstanding, and will no doubt be nominated for an Oscar. The performances were excellent, though nothing Oscar worthy, as is the case with most of Nolan's films ('The Dark Knight' being the obvious exception). Hans Zimmer's score was amazing and blended perfectly with the film. All in all, 'Interstellar' is an excellent movie, which I personally think is Nolan's most beautiful film to date."

Great performances, incredible visual effects, an interesting story, and tons of really cool concepts, which make for a few genuinely powerful scenes, However, that doesn't make it the flawless masterpiece of cinematic genius everybody is labeling it as. There are tons of people giving this movie 10/10 ratings, leading to a user rating of 8.7, and it is now #29 on the IMDb top 250. WOW! That is a lot of praise! On the top 250, \"Interstellar\" is above \"Casablanca\", \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", \"Psycho\", \"Apocalypse Now\", and \"CITIZEN KANE\"! According to the users on IMDb, this movie's better than \"Citizen Kane\", which has been known as possibly the greatest film of all time!\n\nIs is better than \"Citizen Kane\"? No, not even close. The film is full of flaws, the biggest being the runtime. I may never see this movie again because of how long it felt! It feels like a lot of scenes are unneeded, and were made just so the movie could be longer, because Christopher Nolan wanted to make it seem really epic. I'm sure if Nolan cut a huge chunk of the movie out, it would've been better. A film by Nolan that is better than this one is \"The Dark Knight\", which has a somewhat long runtime, but it feels way shorter than it's runtime, and is extremely entertaining throughout. \"Interstellar\" is so long that it starts to really drag on and, at times, I began to just zone out.\n\nThe film is also a bit too dramatic. The dialogue about how \"love conquers all\" seemed very unnecessarily corny, as well as a few other select scenes in the movie. However, some sequences were quite powerful, especially the ending, which, actually, was kind of creepy. The concept of time was very prominent throughout the film, and it lead to some pretty creative and powerful sequences.\n\nOverall, the film is recommended, but you should be warned that this movie was LOOOOOOOONG!!!!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "OK, I'll keep this brief, but I'll also nail my credentials to the mast first. I know science, cosmology, sci-fi and film-making pretty well. I have, in the past taught film studies at degree level, and worked on the production of more than one major Hollywood sci-fi film. I read Stephen Baxter and I like space stuff a lot. More than a lot. And why am I telling you this? Because I should have loved \"Interstellar\", but I didn't for one simple reason: It is a truly dreadful piece of film-making.\n\nI won't even bother with dissecting the \"science\" in the film, because that isn't really the issue (it is wrong on pretty much every level). I'm not even going to bother complaining about the absurd audio balance in the sound mix. And I'll ignore the sub-standard special effects - because FX don't a great movie make.\n\nThe issues I have with Interstellar are essentially these: The film is an arse-numbing three hours long, and feels far longer. The pace is stunningly poorly judged - the first hour in particular could have been cut to ten minutes and far more would have been gained than lost.\n\nThe characters are paper-thin, and I didn't care about any of them. The plot is entirely derivative (mostly of the vastly superior \"Contact\"). The special effects aren't special at all and the editing (or lack of) is so self-indulgent it is a text book example of a director so enamoured with his project that he loses objectivity. The result is a plodding, flabby, and desperately dull movie devoid of any real excitement or emotional impact.\n\nI won't go on, but special mention must be made of the planets - Paddling World and Coldworld. You see virtually nothing of either, and so utterly uninteresting are they that what should have been a moment of genuine cinematic wonderment was squandered with a bit of poor CGI painfully inferior to \"A Perfect Storm\" and a location less dramatic than your own back garden.\n\nI've probably not been a brief as I intended, but as I write this I feel the disappointment and actual anger I felt on leaving the cinema bubbling to the surface again. It was a total let-down and a waste of more than three hours of my life. The gushing reviews on here are ridiculous and absurd, and I am forced to conclude that reviewers either watched a different film to me, or saw something so brilliant it completely passed me by. I am fairly confident I didn't doze off, although I desperately wanted to.\n\nSo in conclusion, \"Contact\" did all of this far, far better, fifteen years ago. In Contact the characters are human, believable, beautifully realised and you care what happens to them. The relationship between Father and Daughter is deeply moving and inspiring. But then the plot is far more sophisticated anyway, dealing with the social tensions and impact of the discovery of extra-terrestrial life, the science is accurate and entirely plausible (it was written by Carl Sagan after all), the movie is genuinely thrilling and full of spectacle, and it has something very profound to say.\n\nContact is everything Interstellar is not, and it has a considerably shorter running time. Contact brought tears to my eyes, Interstellar bored me to tears."

        "review_detailed_main": "Love is the one thing that transcends time and space...\n\nNew creation of Christopher Nolan's genius, whose name is now known to everyone. His films are waiting with a special look, because it offers something that every day, unfortunately, less and less can be found in the world of mass cinema - an interesting spectacle, filled with meaning, ideas and emotions. At this time, Christopher decided to send us not to the world of dreams, and even not on the dark streets of Gotham City. No, now he send us to the journey to, and perhaps beyond the boundaries of the possible and impossible, through the curvature of space and time, in other worlds. And you won't forget this trip, this can be assured.\n\nI was madly waiting for Interstellar's release. And then, finally, I was able to see this Beauty - at the premiere in my coutry on October, 29. It was incredibly exciting. It was a delight. It was unforgettable. It was gorgeous. Nolan once again amazes the viewer's imagination by his painting. Journey to the brink of infinity, the line where humanity has never set, acts as either the first-born purpose and a background of emotional history about the father and the daughter. A loving father who mankind need to help, but that he should leave his children, and a loving daughter who doesn't want to let her dad in the infinity darkness.\n\nStarting from the very first frame and ending with the closing credits, a new picture of Nolan will absorb you completely, forcing stare at the screen during the whole action, because it's all so exciting and interesting that escape becomes physically impossible. No, this three hours won't fly quickly for you. You'll feel every emotion, every event, every character. You will not look how the main characters travel through the universe, because the movie experience in this film is so excellent that you will be on board of \"Endurance\" starship and travel between the worlds with the main characters by yourself.\n\nThe emotional core of this story is the relationship of Matthew McConaughey's character and his daughter - Mackenzie Foy' and Jessica Chastain' character. And the acting work of these three artists in \"Interstellar\" impress the most. McConaughey was acting really great, and this is one of the most emotional, if not the most emotional role of his life. All the drama and tragedy of the relationship of father and daughter in this film will not leave anyone indifferent. Anne Hathaway, Wes Bentley, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck, Ellen Burstyn and other actors also coped with their roles and presented the film's supporting characters very realistic. I would particularly like to note a small but important in this story role of Matt Damon, a character who has received quite memorable. If we talk about the characters, it should be noted also two robots that accompanied our heroes in this difficult journey. One of them adds a touch of humor in the film, which mitigates constantly depressing, dramatic, and sometimes really dark atmosphere.\n\nThe script of the film is very well combined the history of space exploration and the relationship between Cooper and Murph. The story is complex and complicated, is based on real scientific theories by Kip Thorne, and indeed contains a reference to the \"Space Odyssey\" and other sci-fi pictures. This story about true love, about loyalty, forgiveness, fraud, hard decisions, and much more. And it is designed so that leaves a lot of room for the imagination of the viewer. It's also possible to notice some structure allusion to another Nolan's work - Inception. The story and visuals are combined just perfectly in Interstellar.\n\nHans Zimmer's score, written by him on the basis of only one letter from Nolan, hold the key: \"Once we become parents, we can't help but look at ourselves through the eyes of our children\", deserves a special praise. On this basis, Hans managed to write just incredible soundtrack that perfectly harmonizes with the history and the visual side of the picture. And this work of the composer is really different from the previous ones. It is executed in a different style from another subject in its base. Very impressive work, which will be pleasantly listened again and separate from the film itself.\n\nVisual range of the picture is incredibly beautiful and circuses. The \"Endurance\" itself, new worlds, insanely beautiful and mysterious space, wormholes, black holes, and travel through them, folds of time and space are arranged so that is simply breathtaking. I would like to thank all those who contributed to the creation of a visual of this film. It must be seen. That mastery with which this is done, not just words. In the visual pattern also has some references to the Kubrick's \"Odyssey\", and they are pleasing to the eye.\n\nMany thanks to Christopher Nolan for having given us such an incredible movie, which once again proved to us that the cinema is Nolan's life.\n\n\"Interstellar\" is a film that wins the hearts of the audience not only with its sci-fi splendor, but also an emotional story that lies at its very heart. This film is not only about the discoveries, space exploration and the final frontier of mankind, but also about the relationship of father and daughter, who were in a difficult situation in life when one has to leave the other in the name of a goal that can not be underestimated. So, with what Nolan's genius unfolds before us this action is beyond praise. Combining the story, filled with not only real science fiction, but the true human values and emotions, outstanding and very emotional performances, breathtaking visuals, epic and dramatic soundtrack, Christopher Nolan breathed the life into this film by his directing to create something truly masterpiece again.\n\n\"Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night... Rage, Rage Against The Dying Of The Light.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "The key of this movie may feel like you're watching only a Science-Fiction movie. Most of the times Sci-Fi movies are not great at telling an effective, emotional drama stories. You can't find this type of movie easily, unless you are watching a Sci-Fi movie directed by Christopher Nolan and written by Jonathan Nolan.\n\nMixing those two genres is unique and dangerous. All the Nolan's projects are a bit dangerous and special.\n\nNot only the storyline is so great but also nearly all other technical details are great!\n\nBrilliant scores that composed by Hans Zimmer.\n\nThe film editing is just beyond perfect. One of the best film editings of all time.\n\nThe Cinematography by Wally Pfister is quite realistic and charming.\n\nThe VFX are just stunning. Even the scientist are amazed by how great it is.\n\nSome of the people thinks this movie is based on wrong theories, so that makes it a bad movie. As you may know, all the movies are based on wrong things. You are watching a Sci-Fi movie. In being realistic, Sci-Fi movies are just one step ahead of Fantasy. Why would you look for reality in this movies? It's not a crime movie. If people would demand realistic movies, there would be a bigger Documentary sector.\n\nThe main reason why people think like that is this movie is not only based on wrong theories. It's mixed. Some of the theories are proven, some of them has potential to be true, some of them are not likely true.\n\nBut you can't make a movie that reflects so effective storyline with only the truth. Even \"Based on A True Story\" movies are so changed to make it more effective. You can't name any Sci-Fi movie that based on all true theories. Other Sci-Fi movies are not explaining the questions at all. And somehow when this movie tries to explain, this movie becames faulty. So better not trying to explain what's going on? In this movie there is no major flaw that you can't ignore. The main story is just so effective and perfect."

        "review_detailed_main": "So last night I got the chance to see the early screening of Christopher Nolan's Interstellar. The film I've been waiting so much from the early days of the shooting. How did it fare? Here's my take:\n\nTo avoid any tl;dr risk, let me get this straight from the very beginning, Interstellar is one goddamnedly good film, it gets you to the edge of your seat, it soars, it warps, it rips your brain senseless. It's that good.\n\nInterstellar is a story about the earth dying, with its soil no longer able to sustain crops other than corn, and of course, it will lead to the extinction of humanity. Our hero is an ex-NASA test pilot named Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a typical ordinary-guy-in-an-extraordinary- situation everyman who's also a dedicated family man, especially toward his daughter Murphy (named after the Murphy's Law). In an all-too-Armageddon style our hero gets invited by the (publicly) defunct NASA to become humanity's last hope in finding a new home, for they have found a wormhole near Saturn (2001, anyone?) which will warp the astronauts to another galaxy in quest of a habitable planet. Solid and compact premise, although it's been used before.\n\nFor seasoned filmgoers, there are many similar elements (although it's understandable) with Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Robert Zemeckis' Contact (1997). In a sense that this is not a bang-bang-shoot-shoot-blow-em-up sci-fi, but more of a slow-burning, metaphysical sci-fi which gets you to think about your place in the universe and your exact place in time.\n\nSimilarity with 2001 and Contact is never a bad thing, but it becomes a wee bit too predictable, although Nolan is a smart enough director in providing the final (a very sentimental one, I should say) twist in the story. The visuals in this film is majestic, everything is shot to a meticulously calculated level, Nolan-style. The space scenes are serenely suspenseful just like Cuaron's Gravity, but unlike the documentary feel of Gravity, there's a real gusto and pace to these scenes. You should also be prepared for the (for some, maybe) unexpected third act, it is Nolan's most sentimental and humane moment to date. And this is why Interstellar is more than just a science-fiction, it is a human drama intertwined in space and time loop.\n\nOne thing that Nolan gets a bit wrong is the narrative. Nolan was never a 'warm' director, his films are filled with brilliant ideas and flair but it feels cold, it maybe suits Memento and The Dark Knight but in Interstellar he seems to have been lost in determining which of the interpersonal drama or the sci-fi that will be Interstellar's forte. The result is a rather incongruous script, intermittently cutting off the excitement of the previous scene and so on. But it is a forgivable sin, for the good is a lot more than the bad in this monumental film. At the end of the day, all I can say is that Interstellar is a grand film. It is monolithic, thoughtful, sentimental, sophisticated, visceral but also with its flaws. I wouldn't say it's Nolan's best work to date, but I daresay that this is one of the best science fiction ever released.\n\nAfter watching Interstellar, do yourself a favor and get lost in space and time and go back in time to see Contact (1997) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) to further wonder and wander into the realms of the unknown.\n\nBecause sometimes it is the unknown that fascinates us, frightens us and brings out the best in us."

It is slow, dark as a black hole, loud as an old Barton Theater Organ playing Fugue in D Minor interesting as a litter box.\n\nThe story is thin.....I can't blame the actors, the entire plot is pretty simple. Can't inhabit earth, find somewhere else to live. Interstellar is a repeat of time continuum stories you have heard or seen before, I wont spoil it, but it's all been told before.\n\nDialog is dreary, slow, ponderous. The comparison to 2001 is preposterous. The wonder and awe of 2001 and other movies before it was it had never been done it was the first. 2001 was all done without the advanced technology we have in computer imagery we have today. 2001 was a pioneering effort. This is not at all pioneering, inventive or surprising if you read science fiction at all.\n\nThe imagery is not all that unique or impressive. The constant thumping and droning of background music was mind numbing. Most of the show I was trying to nod off, but for the LOUD THEATER ORGAN playing in the background I probably would have.\n\nI have to agree with some of the reviewers who thought the whole show was ridiculous and in some ways they are right. Somehow science has advanced enough to create interstellar space travel but not far enough to build power cells, clean power, they are still burning fossil fuels. The robots are Lego like, silly looking clunks of stainless steel....it is all so ridiculous.\n\nI would not call this HORRIBLE or AWFUL I have seen some real stinkers over the years. Interstellar is not so ridiculous it is a parody of a good movie it is just not a great movie some had hoped it to be."

Like his earlier movies, Christopher Nolan once again proved, how big a movie can be! There were some shots,which made audience go crazy..Some scenes were as epic as 2001: A Space Odyssey. Do not go into the theatre expecting an action packed cerebral thriller. This one is not for action fans. At times, movie go highly sentimental( Matthew McConaughey does what he is best in and supposed to). I recommend this movie to all the Sci-Fi fans out there, make sure you go in group of sci-fi nuts!! Do not go with the hype..Go, sit back and enjoy. Just like Inception, this movie will be known as great after few months(I know people who said Inception was a crap when it released, and after few months rating it 10/10 in IMDb :D). I don't wanna spoil anything(If you want PM me). Also, make sure you go to the best theatre close to you. (If you loved Donnie Darko, 2001: A Space Odyssey, this is the one for you, Get ready to get mind blown!!) Interstellar Movie is EPIC in all sense!!"

That isn't what killed the movie however, it was the acting! Maybe the director wanted the actors to act that way, but every time they did something amazing, they barely acted surprised. It was as if it was all in a days work. This is the sole reason why I can't get myself to re- watch this movie. The visuals were amazing, but I'm more interested in plot lines and character development than pretty effects (call me old school, even though I'm in my 20's). The movie tries to be like 2001: A Space Odyssey, but falls short. 2 months after watching Interstellar, not much is retained in my memory (I had to re-read the ridiculous plot and re-watch a trailer to bring my memory back). Whereas 2001 I watched 6 or so months ago and remember most of it.\n\nIt may seem like I'm calling this movie terrible, it's not. It's just highly overrated and I need to point out the flaws that keep this from being a masterpiece. Maybe I've seen too many programs about space (Cosmos, The Universe, 2001, etc) that keep this movie from stunning me with the visuals, but if you're a person that has not seen too many space programs, you'd probably like it.\n\nAnd just an FYI, this is coming from a guy that hated Gravity and Inception. If you like those, you may like this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Wowser! This Christopher Nolan film was presaged with such marketing hype that I went in with pretty low and cynical expectations. But I was frankly blown away with it.\n\nJust about everyone raves about Christopher Nolan's work, and you look back at his Filmography and it makes for a pretty impressive resume: from Memento via the (rather over-hyped imho) Dark Knight Batman series-reboot through to Inception, one of my favourite films of all time. For me, Interstellar is right up there with Inception for thought-provoking, visually spectacular and truly epic cinema.\n\nWe start in familiar 'Day after Tomorrow\" territory, with mankind having in some way \u2013 not entirely explained \u2013 messed up the planet. As I understood it (and the film probably does require multiple watches with \u2013 see comments below \u2013 subtitles=on) the rather clever premise is that the world's food supplies are being progressively destroyed by a vindictive 'blight'. This delivers the double whammy of destroying mankind's provisions but also, by massive reproduction of the organism, progressively depleting the Earth's oxygen. For some reason \u2013 again, which I didn't get on first viewing \u2013 this is accompanied by massive dust storms. It is a morbid bet as to what is going to get the mid-West population first: starvation, lung disease or suffocation. Matthew McConnaughey plays the widowed Cooper, an ex-NASA drop out turned farmer given the opportunity by mission-leader Professor Brand (an excellent Michael Caine) to pilot a NASA mission. The goal is to punch through a mysterious wormhole in space where they suspect, through previous work, that a new home for mankind could be found.\n\nThe first part of the film is set on and around Cooper's farm, setting in place one of the emotional wrenches at the heart of the film: that Cooper in volunteering for the mission and having to leave behind his elderly father (John Lithgow, again superb) and young children Murph (aged 10) and Tom (aged 15) whilst recognising that danger for him comes not just from the inherent risks involved but from the theory of relativity that could change everything, time-wise, for when he returns.\n\nCooper is supported on the mission by a team of scientists including Brand's daughter played by a love-struck Anne Hathaway, who again shows she can act.\n\nTo say any more would spoil what is a voyage of visual and mental discovery. (However, I would add that it is good to see that the character that plays my namesake Dr Mann (in a surprise cameo) is equally good looking! LOL).\n\nIn terms of plus points, where do I start? The visuals are utterly stunning. Whilst reminiscent in places of Kubrick's \"stargate\" from 2001, the similarity is only passing. The film adds a majesty and scale to space that surpasses wonder. Elsewhere there are some interesting visual effects: this might have just been me of course, but after the dramatic launch there was something about the camera moves during the first scenes of weightlessness that made me feel genuinely nauseous.\n\nEqually stunning is Hans Zimmer's score which is epic and (in places) very VERY loud. The film certainly doesn't \"go quietly into the night\"! When matching the noise of the score/choir to the sound effects in the launch sequence the combination is ear-bleedingly effective. This must be a strong contender for the soundtrack Oscar for 2014. One quibble, again 2001 related, is that Zimmer uses the last chord of Also Sprach Zarathustra in the score sufficiently often that one hopes Richard Strauss's estate receives some royalties! The acting is top notch: I've already mentioned Caine and Lithgow, but McConnaughey, Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are all great. A particular shout-out should go to Mackenzie Foy as the young Murph, who is magnetically charismatic and just brilliant in the role.\n\nAbove all, Nolan's direction is exquisite. The film has a slow build on earth (which adds to the lengthy running time) but defines the characters and primes the plot perfectly. And some of the editing cuts \u2013 again, Cooper's farm departure/launch sequence overlay is a great example \u2013 are superb in building the mood and the tension.\n\nI've decided that I am an extremely tough reviewer and for me a 10 star film is a rarity indeed. Where I could have knocked off a star was in some of the dialogue on the soundtrack, which was pretty inaudible in places: McConnaughey in particular with his general mumbling and strong southern accent is indecipherable in places. I look forward to the DVD subtitles. And one of the character's dying words \u2013 delivering a key plot point in the film \u2013 was completely lost to me (but thankfully later restated). Whilst the expansive plot is highly ambitious, the end of the film, playing fast and loose with physics I fear, requires a gravity-defying suspension of belief (although I guess the same could equally be said of 2001: A Space Odyssey).\n\nHowever, the film has stayed so firmly lodged in my mind for 24 hours I will make a rare exception to my rating 'rule'. Overall, this is a top-notch Sci-Fi film. And a final word: PEOPLE\u0085 THIS IS A MUST SEE ON THE BIG SCREEN!

Believe it or not. It's the simple and the complicated, It's the usual and the different, It's the mind and the heart, It's an emotional and psychological journey through the unknown which has its own stunning visuals. It's an original story and thought-provoking masterpiece.\n\nEvery single time with him, you just got crazy about his ideas, astonished by his mind games and inspired when he talks to the heart.\n\nBack then, he was an ambitious young director. And with his capabilities made his own way straight through the world. Now, he is an icon and a legend of directing. He is Christopher Nolan...\n\nReally guys, what's wrong with this guy ?!! what's going on inside his head ?!!\n\nIt's our job to honor the honorable. Please, Just keep the rating UP, why ? Because Chris. and Interstellar deserve it."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Interstellar\" pretends to be more intelligent than Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's audio-visual roller coaster, \"Gravity\", but ironically its best moments are those which, like Gravity, rely purely on thrill and spectacle.\n\nFor the rest of the film we are crammed into a tiny shuttle with McConaughey and his crew, or back on earth with the desperate remnants of human civilization as they attempt to solve the problem of starvation. Most of the dialogue consists of reams and reams of contrived quantum-physics babble, which, if you're like me, will whoosh straight over your head like those exposition sequences in CSI, with brief moments of levity provided by the two -weirdly cubic looking- robots TARS and CASE.\n\nTheir journey to find another habitable planet is marred by a sequence of seemingly insurmountable problems that become progressively so ludicrous, it ends up impossible to take them seriously, albeit exciting to watch.\n\nWe already have to stretch our disbelief past the opening premise that the world is dying because of crop blight, yet they've managed to build robots that have human intelligence and can adapt a variety of shapes to achieve a wide range of tasks. One wonders why humans at this level of technological advancement couldn't have found a solution to curbing this unexplained blight other than blasting off into a foreign galaxy to try and populate a mysterious planet neighboring a black hole.\n\nGlaring plot issues aside (and there are many), the film is at its best when in full space simulator mode and the audience is being catapulted into the roaring white light of a black hole, accompanied by Hans Zimmer's electrifying score (props to Zimmer for once NOT composing something that sounded exactly like Pirates of The Caribbean), making full use of the IMAX experience.\n\nPerformances are fairly solid, in particular Jessica Chastain as the grown up Murph, and there is enough raw emotion on show to push some of the more logically questionable moments past your cynic meter and give a sense of weight and importance to what is happening, even if you can't quite understand it.\n\nDefinitely worth watching on the big screen, but would I give it a 9/10? No way. This is a film that you will enjoy on face value, but once you leave the cinema you will start picking it to shreds. There are just too many inconsistencies, contrivances and blatant stupidity in the plot to call this a masterpiece, but I'd give it a solid 7 for blockbuster entertainment value."

It shows that in 1968 they were able to make a masterpiece and in 2014 they can't even copy it decently. The fact that on IMDb it has an higher rating than the Kubrick masterpiece makes me lose all faith in the progress of humanity and in our current generation. I will watch 2001: A space odyssey again to forget about it and restore faith in human kind again."

It's not a bad movie but it's not a great one either (which a 9 should be). It's creative in terms of story but it is drawn out. It goes for the Gravity look and feel, being slow, filmed in space and with dialog often replaced with music, but it does not have the suspense of Gravity. It's doesn't draw you in. It just doesn't have enough substance to carry it off. It has plenty of promise but lets you down in the end, especially once you pull all the pieces together to formulate what's going on. It's still worth watching, at 7/10, just don't expect a 9/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have to begin this review by acknowledging that I saw this movie under less than optimal conditions - on the screen on the back of a Jet Blue seat. Whatever visual magic might have impressed me was grainy and small, and the sound was murky. There's a good chance I would have liked this film better if seen properly.\n\nThat being said, I probably wouldn't have liked it a *lot* better, because the things I didn't like would have been the same.\n\nFirst off, I thought the movie was off to a real slow start. It was basically a dust bowl family saga, and while I'll admit you needed some context for what happens later, it felt like it went on much too long.\n\nThe early space experience also didn't engage me that much. Part of the problem might just be my expectations for a Christopher Nolan movie. I knew almost nothing about this film going in, but I think of Nolan as the director of Inception and Memento, and Interstellar was just so darn straightforward (at least at first).\n\nEventually (the movie is almost three hours, so it really takes its time) the film's more intriguing ideas appear, such as the trickiness of relative time. The movie also becomes more eventful. Yet still there were things I found offputting; the first death in the movie makes no sense; it shouldn't have happened, and realistically wouldn't have. (Later I read a critique that pointed out that the whole scene wouldn't have happened that way unless everyone involved was an idiot.)\n\nThe movie did, become more engrossing as it got more involved, playing with its time concept and tossed in some interesting twists and suspenseful moments.\n\nAlas, whatever gains the movie had made in my heart were squandered in the end. Apparently the movie had a scientist to make sure the science was good, and perhaps it was, yet to me the final part seemed incredibly silly, with way too much leaning on non-science things like intuition. And the last scenes were just .... huh? (Although someone in the IMDb board came up with a very Christopher Nolan interpretation of the end that I found more appealing.)\n\nAs I say, if I'd seen it on the big screen I might have been more forgiving of its flaws, and it's very possible things like the reportedly hardcore seriousness with which it approached getting the look of a black hole just right would have made its length and plot weaknesses more palatable. But even saying that, I cannot see any way this movie would ever impress me as much as it has others."

It has Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway going to space and seeking possible livable planets for places to move the earth people when that planet becomes uninhabitable. Christopher Nolan directs quite a long but mostly intriguing tale of how long this journey lasts and the effect on McConaughey's offspring when they grow up without having him around during those times. I have to admit that part of me was ready to sleep during some scenes but something exciting does always come up and it gets a little better as the narrative keeps on going. So on that note, Interstellar is very much worth seeing if you're patient enough to watch quite a long movie requiring you to think."

Its plot is up there with \"armaggeddon\" in pure stupidity and forced US-cowboy-patriot-macho-ism, its special effects are underwhelming, its plot twists are obvious, its setting makes no sense, its characters are flat and forgettable, and its constant citations of \"2001\" just serve to make you remember how much better Kubrick did all of this with a tiny fraction of the money almost 50 years back.\n\nDisappointing."

It's not a simple movie, maybe that was already clear, is a Nolan's film.\n\nMatthew McConaughey does a great job by portraying Cooper. The most touching scenes are those between his character and Mackenzie Foy, who plays the younger version of Murph, Jessica Chastain character. Either it seems to be an \"Outer Space Film\" is more about human relations and how important is for us to be linked with others.\n\nEven it's a long movie, 169 minutes, I didn't felt it that long or tedious. The director managed to keep us engaged through the whole film.\n\nThe experience on IMAX in 70mm film. The image quality perceived was superb, now I get why Christopher Nolan and other directors are fighting to keep film alive.\n\nI had the opportunity to watch it at the Chinese theatre and was a great experience, my first time in that theatre. The staff from the theatre even told us that Nolan himself watched several scenes of the movie in that theatre to \"calibrate\" the experience. Which is very cool.\n\nWell, I encourage you to go and watch Interstellar to see of you love or hate it."

I'm trying to find the right words to express the thrilling journey that is this film.\n\nFirst I'd like to advice you to try and pay attention to every single line - nothing is said without purpose and everything is somehow connected. It slowly builds up with the beginning to this phenomenal emotional ride and it will not let go until the very end. It will keep you on the edge of your sit - literally -, it will make you cry, it will make you jump, it will completely absorb you. Throughout the course of it I forgot I was in a cinema. I was living every single moment with the characters, feeling what they're feeling. At times, I found myself staring blankly trying to comprehend its complexity - How can this be? Is this really happening? Can it be so epic?\n\nThe second time I saw it I understood the importance of every single scene and line, I saw more connection, more intricacy and (even) more genius in it. The first time it was grand and overwhelming, it just hit me hard and I couldn't really pay attention to details.\n\nThe emotional journey part was very important to me; but of course, there are the stunning visuals which contribute immensely and transcend you there, into the action. They were fantastic, superb, simply put, film-making at its finest.\n\nThis is all, of course, from my point of view - a super sci-fi, fantasy, adventure and all associated genres enthusiast. Although I cannot imagine how one, regardless of their movie preferences, can dislike \"Interstellar\" - it's that good.\n\nWhat I'm obviously saying is GO SEE THIS MOVIE. Expect epicness. It will not disappoint."

I found it absolutely amazing, rarely do I use a word like 'spellbinding' to describe a movie but I really do feel like Interstellar is well worthy of it. Matthew McConaughey was excellent as well. He really shows the great emotional range he has as an actor.\n\nThe story is about a group of explorers, led by former pilot and engineer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), who embark on a journey through a newly discovered wormhole near the planet Saturn. Their main mission is to save humanity from extinction by an environmentally devastated Earth.\n\nThe film was not only beautiful to look at, but it was very well written too. However, like with Inception, you REALLY need to pay attention to pretty much everything that happens to fully understand what is going on. It's difficult for me to go into too much detail without giving away important plot points so you'll just have to see for yourself.\n\nI rate it a very high 9.5/10 and I highly recommend it to any fan of Christopher Nolan and anyone who enjoys intelligent science fiction. I personally consider it one of the best and most thought provoking science fiction films I've ever seen."

The duration is just to long, especially the first part, which brings nothing extra to the story. It's just to stretched out trying to bring I don't know what. A feel of 2001 maybe, but 2001 is in another galaxy for this one. I didn't like Inception either, so maybe it has got to be something with Nolan. I'm a sci-fi fan, but today everyone's trying to make sci-fi, but they don't succeed. They are doing it wrong! District 9 was the last good sci-fi I watched.

Steady and unique in its nature, I did feel that this movie might end up like last years blockbuster 'Gravity' starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. With every minute that passed, I could feel the importance of time, which let my prejudice drain away. With twists and turns, but not brain-spraining at all, it did make emotions come at par with adventure.\n\nGreat acting by Matthew McConaughey did overshadow Anne Hathaway. With an epic storyline and Nolan's direction Space, Galaxy and the Universe did reach a whole new level.\n\nI would love to rate this movie 10 stars without a second thought because it reached the depth of my heart and left me speechless. This movie is not a movie which is meant to be wasted by watching it at your laptop or TV. It's buck worthy and a must watch for all the people who wait for some new serious, touching, heartwarming, adventurous, Science Fiction and Oscar deserving movies of all time. Hat's off to both the Nolans!"

The story was very well written even though sometimes too complicated to understand but then again who are we to understand anything about the unknown dimensions, black holes or wormholes. You have got to stay concentrated during the whole movie to understand the story but like I said before with Interstellar it is certainly not a problem at all. I was completely absorbed by the story and was actually surprised that time flew by so easily. One of the better movies I watched this year and certainly the best sci-fi in years."

        "review_detailed_main": "Every generation of movie goers sees one film, maybe two, that changes the game for them. It becomes a signature moment that they remember years to come. They remember where they saw it, who they saw it with, even where they were sitting. Christopher Nolan has proved to be a film maker who works best with a big canvas, and he has never been given a canvas bigger than the one he used for his latest film, \"Interstellar\". I feel I can't even call going to see a Nolan piece a movie but more like an \"event\". For the average movie goer, they most likely aren't familiar with the directors of the films they're seeing but most know Nolan. Most know of Nolan because he has made some of the biggest, thrilling, and thought provoking films of the past decade from the Dark Knight trilogy to Inception.\n\nIt's almost not worth trying to do a plot synopsis of \"Interstellar\" because it is difficult to try to condense the happenings in a film this huge because I know that I will leave out something big. Anyway, the film takes place in a potentially not-too-distant future where the earth has become unable to produce all but a few crops and it will get to a point where none will be able to grow and man will die out. In comes an engineer/pilot/father Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) who is entrusted to be part of a space expedition to venture beyond a newly discovered wormhole to try and find a new planet capable of inhabiting the human race. Astronauts from previous missions have supposedly landed and have been sending signals for them to come.\n\nMcConaughey has always had that \"movie star\" potential and I think this is the film that puts him in that title. This was a truly star making role due to the size of the film and I honestly believe he is the only man who could have done it. \"Interstellar\" was originally supposed to be done by Steven Spielberg before he dropped out and Nolan stepped in. Nolan, clearly influenced by past Spielberg films like \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" and \"Jaws\", puts McConaughey in a role in the same vein as Richard Dreyfuss in \"Close Encounters\" or Roy Schneider in \"Jaws\". They needed an actor who could be looked at as an everyday guy who is experiencing incredible circumstances and McConaughey is able to display the emotion required for a man who has to drop everything, including his family whom he knows he may not see again, and try to save the human race. You can see it in his eyes and hear it in his voice and your heart breaks and lifts with his simultaneously. This isn't necessarily a role that wins Oscars but it should be.\n\nThe effects are obviously amazing. This, much like \"Gravity\" last year, is a film that needs to be seen on the big screen, especially in IMAX. This, along with the haunting score of frequent Nolan collaborator Hans Zimmer, almost transports you to that necessary place that makes the events happening on screen seem possible. Kind of piggy backing off of that point, there will be those who will trash the film for \"the science isn't accurate\". Those comments are nonsense because no matter what \"science\" tells us, there is just no way for us to actually comprehend what is beyond a wormhole or what would happen if we attempted to go through one. Could we really transcend time and space? Would we discover new worlds and new civilizations? Impossible for us to say at this point, but what makes this film so great is that we are able to see the ideas of \"what can be\". It's the mystery of the unknown that both frightens and enthralls man and few films have been able to capture those feelings like \"Interstellar\" In a time where there are no more explorers, we're fortunate to be put in a position where we can feel what is like to discover and explore new worlds.\n\nPeople will remember \"Interstellar\" for either being a truly great film experience or \"not as good as 2001: A Space Odyssey\". This is one of most popular slights against the film so far as it is the closest thing to \"2001\" and defenders of the Kubrick classic will argue to the death that it doesn't live up to it. This is an argument that no one will win because it is a generational issue. People see these landmark films during their youth and they leave such an impression on them, that it almost becomes blasphemy to hear of another film made years later, rivaling the one they saw. People want to believe that the film from their time was the best and that no film will be able to capture those emotions they first felt and the memories that it created for them. I respect and detest this because I will most likely feel the same way when future space adventures in the same vein as \"Interstellar\" come out and I fear it is something that is out of my control. Much of the film circles around the idea that love is the one true thing that travels purely through time and space because it is that connection we feel with one another that makes us human and that can be applied with our love for certain films. The connection we feel with our favorite films is almost unshakable and those who think they can make us waver from those feelings are exercising in futility.\n\nIn the end, \"Interstellar\" is one of those landmark films. It's a chance for us to escape reality and feel sense of adventure, hope, and amazement that rarely comes around. Don't miss it."

There are moments during \"Interstellar\" which may be compared to \"Prometheus\" (also, a better movie). There are even moments and storytelling techniques within \"Interstellar\" that are completely ripped off from \"Inception\" (a much better movie, from Christopher Nolan himself). That said, \"Interstellar\" should still be touted as the most ambitious film of the year so far, and in the same breath, should ultimately go down as one of director Christopher Nolan's worst films to date.\n\nThis highly anticipated Nolan project depicts a future riddled with dust storms, where the world's food supply is nearly depleted (or at least 40 to 60 years out from being depleted, but that doesn't sound nearly as dire) where astronauts are working as farmers and children are taught that the Apollo space missions were faked. During this time, an underground government institution called NASA commissions a group of astronauts (including Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway) for a top secret space mission. This mission will have them traveling through a newly discovered wormhole, with the promise of finding another inhabitable world.\n\nOK, let's get right to it. Any praise I heap upon this movie will be directed at the final 90 minutes of this two hour and 49 minute long film, since the first 80 or so minutes of \"Interstellar\" (while absolutely gorgeous at times to behold) is drenched in sequences of McConaughey seemingly reenacting moments from those pretentious Lincoln car ads, caught in a continuous and almost finger wagging diatribe about how the human race was never meant to die on earth, which nearly put me to sleep. In other words, the first half of this is as slow and lifeless as watching a dead astronaut drift through space. Anyway, this is Intersellar's fatal flaw, since the latter half is ripe with big budget yet very symbolic action sequences, stunning cinematography and fascinating talking points dealing with the nature of human survival in the face of an unsympathetic universe, due to some really insightful slabs of dialogue from a script written by Nolan and his brother, Jonathan. Even the literal rocket science lingo becomes more and more palatable as the \"gravity\" of this plot begins to set in, near the midpoint of Act 2.\n\nFinal Thought/The Ending: Allow me to take a quick spoiler free moment to discuss this ending. During the final act of \"Interstellar\", for most film nerds, Nolan's story will be encroaching on the hallowed grounds of Kubrick's \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". Some will admire the sheer ballsyness of what he does in this pivotal moment and others will find it in bad taste. Though this is not a huge issue, since I don't believe this niche group will have much effect on ticket sales, the problem is that for the millions who didn't see \"Interstellar\" for any film school aesthetic reason, Nolan's ending will simply come off as so strange and obnoxiously far-fetched, that many may leave the theater angry that the punch-line wasn't worth the nearly three hour set up."

It had a few good moments, but in general the whole first half of the movie was... a tiny bit boring. If it hadn't been a Nolan movie, I would probably have left in the break. I'm glad I didn't. But the first half makes me not want to see this movie again. - There are really too many plot holes. Or moments that are not well-explained enough for them to be plausible. Things like characters experiencing revelations based on... well, pretty much nothing. Especially near the end. Which doesn't take away from the awesomeness of the second half. But one has to overlook these things to enjoy the story. - Besides the main theme, most of the score seem misplaced. Too loud. Too bombastic. Or not adding to the emotions on screen. And I'm speaking as a huge Hans Zimmer fan here.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend seeing it. Definitely. But with an expectation that it's not as special as we've come to expect from Nolan."

We've seen rescue mission space movies before, but never with an execution like this one. For as far as acting, writing and cinematography goes, this has got it all. From beautiful visuals of space we've never seen on screen before, to heartfelt moments that has stuck with me ever since I watched it for the first time.\n\nHowever, this movie is not for everyone. The movie can get complicated and if you don't find space interesting at all this may not be it for you. Even so, would still recommend it to everyone who has not seen it. This is a must watch. You definitely don't need to know anything about space to appreciate this cinematic marvel.\n\nInterstellar will have the title as the best space movie ever made, reserved for many decades to come."

It is a visual and sound journey, because yes, the soundtrack is one of the best we can see from Hans Zimmer (and I think that says a lot).\n\nThe level that Nolan reaches to get to this point is incredible, how everything is there, the scientific, it is plausible, it is credible. Although sometimes he may be arrogant and intellectual, I do not consider that he is making fun of the fans, it is all there, all the time.\n\nIt convinces me from beginning to end and despite its length I would watch it a thousand times."

There are a plethora of continuity issues as well as plot holes. It seems like Chris Nolan watched \"Gravity\" and decided he could make a really terrible film into something worth watching. He added the \"Contact\" premise and inserted some Physics theories and some expanded back story to create a mediocre film. I was hopeful that I would be impressed by the obviously inflated reviews but I wasn't. The guy next to me actually fell asleep during the first hour which was very grueling.

Not so, the premise is exactly the same as his last move 'inception', time moves slower the deeper you go or in this case nearer the event horizon of a black-hole. Don't need to be a genius to understand that.\n\nSecondly a lot has been made of his revolutionary mixing of 'dazzling' science fiction and an intimate human story. As for the human story, it's clunky and at times cringe-worthy. It's dull and not particularly well handled with amateurish dialogue characteristic of the Nolan films. If you want to see a movie where the relationship between father and daughter is far better handled watch 'Contact'. As for the science fiction I'd have to say I was disappointed. Parts were very spectacular but I was not impressed by the planet scenes. Iceland yet again and a water planet with shallow seas and massive waves? I was somehow expecting more than this.\n\nOverall grossly over-rated by the critics yet go and see it all the same."

Matthew deserves an Oscar for his role (no joke) and Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is a masterpiece in it's own right (completely new and different from his previous work, check the dark knight trilogy and inception). The FX are brilliant and their are no complaints from me. The acting is just great and it really asks questions on who we are and our purpose. So overall to conclude this film is just MINDBLOWING!"

Literally there is no words to explain the ingenuity of Chris. The way he crafted the characters and effectively using technical expertise and screen writing definitely make us to taste 'Transcendence'. once again he proved that he is not a contemporary director but a director who evolved from unrealistic future.\n\nMatt did a splendid job by portraying 'cooper' and express his emotions as a destitute and grief-stricken father was incomparable. Hans zimmer, he is at his best. Anne and Jess made justice to their roles. Matt Damon and Michael Caine played a pivotal role as well. Chris also made 'India' as part of his film because of 'M.O.M' i think, even though it is little about India i think. overall film is astoundingly superb with intense screenplay unless you detest physics or you lack keenness but its better to study a Lil'bit before 'bon appetite'. Remember \"do not go gentle into that good movie\".\n\n#INTERSTELLAR and #INCEPTION are the best sci-fi masterpieces i've ever seen in this decade.

It fits the movie so well that it was like the movie was made to fit the OST and not the other way around.

Moments after I was at the theater's exit heading out for the bus. I saw it coming just right on time with me, but I didn't get on. I was compelled to walk and think. Think of what I saw... My head was aching, my ears too and my eyes were closing only to call back images from the movie. I got home and found myself undressed and dressed with my casual home clothes.

        "review_detailed_main": "Interstellar marks a critical moment in the career of Christopher Nolan; he has come a long way from being the indie noir director of Memento and Insomnia, to striking gold in the enormously popular Dark Knight franchise. Inception was proof Nolan could successfully tackle a big- budget, original idea outside of the Batman series, but with comic book films behind him, Interstellar has to sell on the promise that Nolan is not a one-hit wonder of big-budget original ideas.\n\nThe movie's plot focuses on Cooper, a Southerner and family man who doesn't quite understand why man is turning away from flight. \"We used to look up at the stars and wonder about our place in the stars,\" he says, \"\u0085now we just look at the ground and see dirt.\" Matthew McCoughaney shines in the role of Cooper, delivering one of his career-best. Cooper is an everyman, and nothing in this world (or any other) is more important to him than his kids; in particular, his daughter Murphy, played spectacularly by Mackenzie Foy.\n\nDespite great performances from a huge ensemble, beautiful visuals and setting, shot by first- time Nolan cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema (Let The Right One In), Interstellar features a typical problem in every Nolan movie: too much expository dialogue. It is very obvious in numerous moments that Nolan is trying to feed us information and backstory. My other issue with the opening of the film is pacing. Thought the movie establishes the world and doesn't rush to do so, the movie rushes off into space the moment the idea of interstellar travel is introduced. From the first act, it is unclear whether Interstellar can deliver.\n\nIt's in the second act where the movie really begins to blossom. Much of the film from this point on is set in space, and boasts mind-bending special effects as timeless as 2001: A Space Odyssey. The movie features some strikingly similar shots, clearly paying homage to the classic space opera. A lot of the shots are wonderful, and Interstellar features the best cinematography in any of his films (sorry Wally Pfister), but a few times, I found myself wondering the purpose of some of these shots of the ship \"Endurance\". Interstellar reaches for the stars, but in act two still seems unsure of where it may land.\n\nIn addition to great visuals, the sound design and score are top-notch. Hans Zimmer does some of his best work, bringing in a score that is both celestial and organic; it perfectly balances tones we normally associate with outer space, while hitting all the right emotional notes. And the movie knows when to be quiet in space; not just outside the ship, but inside. I loved the moments where things were so silent you could hear the background whirring of computers, the slight creaking of the ship, the breath of the characters. The attention to detail in both sight and sound made the movie feel real.\n\nWhen the plot does finally introduce a \"villain\" in it's second act, the movie starts to feel it may have overstayed it's welcome. Interstellar runs at 169 minutes, and it's a long one admittedly. Cooper and Amelia, played by a well-cast Anne Hathaway, are finally forced into unforeseeable circumstances, and Christopher Nolan does not hold back. This makes for some heartstring- tugging sequences, and Interstellar may have benefited from stepping on the brakes with some of the emotionally heavy content, but the acting is so good, that it doesn't matter if it's slightly overdone, and it all builds it to a marvelous climax.\n\nInterstellar's third act is as stunning as anything I've ever seen in film. For critics who thought Inception was proof that Christopher Nolan was not very imaginative visually with free reign, Interstellar proves them wrong. Thematically and scientifically, the movie dares to challenge, it dares its audience to follow into the unknown, beyond the horizon. I am still trying to wrap my head around it all.\n\nNolan's blockbuster epic is not perfect, and it's not for the common audience. If you're looking for big action sequences, or looking to turn your brain off for awhile, you're in the wrong movie. It's got some bumps along the way, but Interstellar is visionary for our time, and so bold in its execution, that it is not bogged down by its few flaws. I was thrilled to take the ride. Interstellar is thought-provoking, emotional, cinematic, and a wonder to behold, which in time, should earn its title in the league of great science fiction.\n\nGrade: A+"

The special effects in this film are awesome, and are used in a way which I was literally at the edge of my seat, in shear anticipation, suspense and a slight sense of nervousness. Its very tense in many parts, and it certainly keeps you thinking. I don't know how people in the right state of mind can give this film a 1 star, or say 'disappointing', 'rubbish' 'stick to batman, Nolan'! These people don't know what they are talking about and are just trying to be picky and find a way to make the film look bad! Its a brilliant film, something suitable for all the family!

The movie attempts to mix jumbled pseudo-scientific dialogue with a melodramatic subplot involving a father and daughter, producing a muddled story with little dramatic power. The movie contains elements from 2001: A Space Odyssey and the Matrix, with its bombastic musical flourishes and the special effects meant to depict extra-dimensionality, all pure Hollywood. Matthew McConaughey is the principal actor; his character, Cooper, is the central figure of the story; the rest of the cast are supporting characters (their placement in the credits notwithstanding). McConaughey gives an interesting performance, which includes several scenes in which he weeps, which for a leading man is remarkable. The depiction of earth as a doomed planet is unconvincing and the plan to colonize other planets half-baked and one that tests the limits of plausibility. Being a science-fiction movie, stretching the boundaries of science for literary purposes is to be expected, but this movie asks the audience to accept certain premises that just do not make sense (e.g, acceleration of time; relationship of time to gravity; time as a material object). This movie is proof that when Hollywood attempts to deal with time warps, time holes, multi-dimensionality, relativity, and other complex scientific theories, the results can be less than optimum."

Excellent casting, descent visuals, and a good sound score. There were times I felt the music was overkill and would drown out certain scenes but overall well done. Story meshed real well too and threw in a few curve balls.\n\nI would have liked to see some better visuals from space. Especially when they arrived in the new solar system. Been cool to have seen unique planets of different colors orbiting each other for instance. Something unique to stamp the distance and uniqueness from our system. Trivial but it's those small things :)"

For a film with such a big scale, it does a great job establishing the world and characters, it can be a lot to take in bit there is just so much emotional payoff that it makes it worth sitting through 3 Hours of film. I won't spoil anything, but the ending is just perfect. It makes you want more from the film but in a way that doesn't make it unsatisfying.\n\nI really have no complaints, it does everything it sets out to do, it is a real shame this didn't win any Oscars."

        "review_title": "Thought-provoking adventure,",
        "review_detailed_main": "This movie felt like it tried to accomplish two simultaneous and somewhat incompatible endeavors.\n\nFirst, it was thought-provoking. Many questions were raised. What would life on earth be like if our climate runs amok? What happens to government when we all have to live hand-to-mouth? Are \"they\" out there communicating with us? Is it the essence of humanity to survive, or is it to pioneer, and, by extension, evolve? Second, it was also an adventure. I watched this in a full IMAX theater, with eighty bajillion watts of Super Thunder-Round Sound, or whatever the kids call it now. The visual effects definitely shine on the IMAX screen. The format switches occasionally, and usually imperceptibly, between 70mm for the scenes with dialogue, to IMAX format for that full-on dose of retina-overload spectacle. This movie is a wonderfully fun ride through a strangely familiar extra-galactic world. There are also plenty of tense moments, after which you realize you've been holding your breath.\n\nI'm glad I went to watch this. That said, I think the film suffers a little from trying to be both an adventure thrill about the dangers of space travel, let alone an actual confrontation with a nemesis, and also a multi-layered allegory involving the dimensional tangle of time, gravity, love, and what it means to survive.\n\nIt asks more questions than it explores. While it fills in for the missing answers with white-knuckled brushes with death, it wasn't as intellectually satisfying as I hoped. I spent an hour discussing the thoughtful components with a friend. In the end, we were grasping to find symbolism, metaphors, or other messages about humanity. We never coalesced \"the message\" of the movie.\n\nBut did we need to? It was, as I said, also a thrill ride. The adventurous climax was a little less than terrifyingly dramatic; I can't say I had the same post-climactic cathartic experience as I've had for other movies. But it was a definite end, closing most of the open plot points. I certainly felt moved by the characters' resolutions.\n\nI was suspicious that Matthew McConaughey could convince me that he was a space-ready engineer; it turns out that he didn't need to, because he did convince me that he was a dad that loved his children as much as any dad could. I think all the leads delivered solidly: Caine, Lithgow, Hathaway, Damon, Chastain, Affleck... I connected with the characters and felt their pain and happiness.\n\nHans Zimmer played up the drama in the music a little heavily, I thought, and unnecessarily. It wound up creating the opposite of the effect I think he intended. Many of the scenes could have used a lighter touch, musically. Some of them worked brilliantly.\n\nAlthough I had my quibbles, the final analysis is that I would definitely choose to watch the movie a second time, but I'm not making plans to, for now."

This film never fails to have an impact on me, it is truly breathtaking work. In fact, it is one of my favourite pictures of all time. 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I went into this movie knowing little about it, no plot details, or even whether christopher nolan was director or just a producer. I have enjoyed nolans previous movies, but i don't care who is behind the camera aslong as the film is serving it's purpose which is to entertain.\n\nSo half an hour goes by, the tone is set. There is a crisis with the crops,earth is running out of food, a lot of dust, no explanation for any of it, just accept it. the film is pretty humourless and lot of mumbling about nothing interesting in particular from the lead..he's an ex nasa pilot who has a farm...sits on the porch drinking a beer and gets philosophical with john lythgow ...more mumbling. Struggling to stay awake.\n\nOkay so the next act things pick up, we have loud launch into space, I'm awake again. Then silence, after all that's whats space is like y'know. Can now hear people munching popcorn. Too quiet. Oh look huge water planet, vast and empty much like this film so far. Huge wave comes.Ah some entertainment at last, clunky robot runs around... then Matt damon ! the last act, blackholes and then there is an semi interesting twist to earlier events.\n\nThis was a frustrating film, had a lot of potential with the story but on an entertaining and thought provoking level it doesn't get there. It starts and stalls. Did anyone really care about the characters? i certainly didn't invest. Obviously some people love it with the scores on here but i cannot agree.\n\nThis is not a masterpiece in sci-fi by any means. There are comparisons to 2001 but don't even go there.I actually looked at my watch towards the end of the film to see how long I'd been trapped in this cinematic black hole."

Maybe someone without any scientific background believes in the pseudo science of this movie but advertising this movie for realism is a very long shot. I was reading many reviews and had high expectations, but left the cinema rather disappointed. The movie is full of inaccuracies and I rather watch a fantasy movie like StarWars or StarTreck but not this pseudo scientific nonsense story."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've had a strange relationship with this movie over the years.\n\nI didn't have the chance to see it in movie theaters when it came out, but caught up with it on streaming release & immediately liked it except for some sections of jarring dialogue & unnecessary exposition - which admittedly took up only about 2% of the movie, but had an outsized effect on me because - well - I expected and desperately wanted perfection.\n\nWhen I viewed it the second time, I was even more angry with the Nolan team for the few mistakes of the film. After all, this was the movie I'd been waiting for someone to make for years. Why couldn't it have been perfect?\n\nI saw it a third time. Why, you may ask? Because despite the errors the story haunted me. And I had to admit to myself that it was beautifully executed & acted, with possibly the best soundtrack in movie history. It was on this viewing that I managed to just let go & relax into the film.\n\nI was stunned.\n\nHow could I have missed this masterpiece? A complex, tightly knit, scientifically accurate story (Kip Thorne won the Nobel prize in physics later in 2017) that seemed to have been plucked right out of some fictional ether, instead of painstakingly worked out around a table in a story room. Some stories are like that; they feel more real than real, like they've always existed and were waiting for a hand to snatch them and gift them to us.\n\nIt occurred to me too that some works of art, like this film, can have a sort of 'emergence' - that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and that it may well take time for a culture to come to recognize its true greatness. I see now that the flaws of this film are very small and actually don't matter at all. The movie's greatness transcends its own mistakes.\n\nI don't know if any movie will ever be made to match Interstellar. As sad as that makes me, I'm happy enough to just keep watching and re-watching. If you haven't seen it yet - I envy you."

Even though some of the sequences in the movie are open to scientific debate, they are simply beautiful - visually and emotionally. As far as the story goes, I could care less as the stunning visuals and great background score more than makes up for it.\n\nFor those who are not fully satisfied with the story, I can understand, could be because of a very high bar set by Christopher Nolan himself. However, Don't let it hold you back if you like Nolan's movies.\n\nIf you're gonna watch it, watch it in IMAX."

I truly believe this to be the movie's best quality and a true feat for the people in charge of visual effects. Having said this, I believe that many viewers were divisive over the plot's complexities. In fact, this is the most emotion driven movie I've seen from Nolan, something that he isn't ultimately known for. Nolan's strenght as a director lies in his ability to present us with a vision. He is meticulous and works the technical aspect of a film like no other director today. Once again, this is proved in every frame shot for Interstellar. So leaving behind my long praise, I now redirect this review to the story.\n\nThe earth is dying, as the effects of our abuse of the natural resources is taking out the crops of food we need to survive. Upon this dark scenario, former NASA engineer Cooper (McConaughey) is asked to pilot a spaceship with the purpose of crossing a wormhole that will lead to another galaxy. This, of course, in hopes of reaching three possible habitable planets explored by scientists sent there in previous missions. Given the unpredictable nature of an unknown environment such as a different galaxy, Cooper will have to decide whether he is willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of humanity or if the urge to reunite with his daughter again is stronger. Personally I liked the story Nolan told us with this film, as it left you thinking about it after the movie was over, something Nolan does very well with his projects. Compared with his previous work, there are still movies that I love more than this. Still Interstellar is a brilliant film in it's own right and yet another great addition to this great director's Filmograhpy.\n\nIn the end all I can say is, if you're a Sci-Fi fan, you surely must not miss this one. It will offer an unique visual experience and leave you wondering what the hell you just watched, even if you didn't feel completely satisfied.\n\nRating: 8/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Earth in the near future is a shell of what it used to be. The plant life is dying. The very soil that used to sustain it is destroying it. There are some underground efforts headed by Prof. Brand (Michael Caine) called Lazarus to find an alternative world to settle in somewhere out there in the vast reaches of space. Three such potential worlds have been found beyond a black hole near Saturn.\n\nCooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a retired NASA engineer who had been chosen to pilot this effort to seek out and investigate these alternative planets. Despite the stiff objections of his 10-year old daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy), he accepts the mission and lifted off together with his crew of three scientists, Amelia (Anne Hathaway), Doyle (Wes Bentley) and Romilly (David Gyasi).\n\nFrom there, we are brought on an unparalleled adventure of space, time and humanity by a master who is probably the most mentally-challenging writer and director in the film industry today, Christopher Nolan. Front and center in this spectacular sci-fi film is the timeless bond between a father and his daughter. The poetic story he has written is multi- layered and emotional, despite its scientific jargon and bleak settings.\n\nAs with his other projects, Nolan works with some of the best technical talents, many of whom are award-winners in their fields. Everyone on this team are guaranteed at least Oscar nominations for their work in this film, and they may in fact all actually win.\n\nFilm editor Lee Smith, sound engineers Gregg Landaker and Gary Rizzo and musical scorer Hans Zimmer together effectively create excitement and drama. The cinematography of Hoyte van Hoytema is breathtaking especially in those wide landscape shots, both on earth and on those other planets. The visual effects are innovative as ever, particularly in the third act where a whole new dimension was created. Production designer Nathan Crowley had some nifty ideas for his futuristic props. The circular design of the mother ship Endurance was beautiful in its symmetry. The designs of the robotic sidekicks TARS and CASE are in no way similar those in Star Wars.\n\nMatthew McConaughey continues his streak of acting excellence which was just capped by an Oscar earlier this year. Michael Caine was as good as he could be expected to be. However, I found his final speech too garbled to be understood well, and it contained an important plot point. Anne Hathaway's role is a bit of a puzzle for me. While she was actually managed to be credible as a scientist, she had a rather cheesy monologue that seemed out of place when it was delivered.\n\nThree talented actresses portray the character of Murphy Cooper at different ages: Mackenzie Foy, Jessica Chastain and Ellen Burstyn. Foy goes way beyond what she was required to do in her two previous hit films the \"Breaking Dawn\" films and \"The Conjuring\". Chastain is such a riveting presence as ever, and it was good to see her again after her long break after \"Zero Dark Thirty\" and \"Mama.\". Oscar winner Burstyn's singular big scene made me tear up.\n\nIn the second hour, I was surprised to see a special, heretofore uncredited, big name guest star portray one of the pioneer Lazarus astronauts, Dr. Mann. This was more than a mere cameo appearance, as his character had a critical role to play in one of the many twisting episodes of this story.\n\nFrom \"Memento\", then \"The Prestige\" to \"Inception\", Nolan had gone for the extremes in terms of plot development. His work is not always easily comprehended on first watch. They are thought-provoking and demanding in terms of a viewer's patience and concentration. \"Interstellar\" joins this stellar list, and we are brought to yet another dimension of time and space. 10/10."

It is a mystery to me, why some filmmakers love to mix so much \"science\" into their movies, when most of it is so horrendously unrealistic, misleading, incomprehensible and incorrect. Kubrick avoided most of the science talk, and created an artistic expression of the space-and-time mystery. That's why \"2001\" will remain a masterpiece and why \"Interstellar\" will be soon forgotten. And the movie is also painfully slow, 168 mins, most of which are spent on closeups of McConaugh and Hathaway, with or without space helmet as well as worn and rusty space equipment, as if that would make it look more real..."

        "review_detailed_main": "How this travesty of a \"sci-fi\" movie has garnered so many gilded reviews is proof that either A) I am way out of step with the great, unwashed movie-going masses or B) the aforesaid masses have never seen a truly great \"sci-fi\" flick. This movie was interminable; I almost walked out 38 minutes into the run, when Mathew was still just a former test pilot trapped in the body of a corn-huskin' farmer.\n\nWhich leads me to my first problem with Interstellar: would you \"hire\" a corn-huskin' farmer and devoted Dad of 2 to be the pilot of an intergalactic space mission? Aside from 1 or 2 very brief allusions, there is ZERO explanation / justification for Matt to be selected for this mission. And strangely enough, Michael Caine ages not 1 day in the 23 years since Matt blasts off for \"strange new worlds\".\n\nHe is still in the same pants and shirt as he was when Matt blasted off (23 years before); the directors did give Mike a wheelchair for good measure. Before I proceed, there were 2 or 3 somewhat interesting plot twists, and the CGI / special FX were very good (just like \"Gravity\", another recent \"sci-fi\" disappointment); although the robot was utterly ridiculous; more like a walkin', talking' 21st century soda machine or a \"Gen 12\" Robbie the Robot.\n\nOf course, CGI and special FX alone do not a classic \"sci-fi\" film make. I cannot disclose 2 major plot disappointments due to the \"spoiler\" clause but suffice it to say the powers behind this film have tried to fuse an entry level class in quantum physics with an action film; and it just didn't work.\n\nI have now accepted, grudgingly, that for enough money you can get the finest actors to play in the most ludicrous films. Read the cast list; scratch your heads in disbelief, along with me. And if you want a classic \"sci-fi\" movie? Try 2001, Blade Runner, and Alien."

        "review_title": "A Cosmic Odyssey of Love and Sacrifice",
        "review_detailed_main": "Christopher Nolan's \"Interstellar\" is a cinematic masterpiece that delves deep into the realms of space exploration, human survival, and the unbreakable bonds of love. With its breathtaking visuals and a hauntingly beautiful score by Hans Zimmer, the film takes audiences on a journey that is as much about the vastness of the universe as it is about the intimate connections between a father and his daughter.\n\nSet in a dystopian future where Earth is dying, the narrative follows a group of astronauts, led by the former pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), as they embark on a perilous mission through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for humanity. The film beautifully juxtaposes the vast, cold expanse of space with the warmth of human emotions, making it a deeply moving experience.\n\nThe scientific concepts, including black holes, time dilation, and the theory of relativity, are intricately woven into the plot, making \"Interstellar\" not just a visual spectacle but also a thought-provoking exploration of the mysteries of the universe. While some may argue that the film takes certain liberties with scientific accuracy, it's essential to remember that at its core, \"Interstellar\" is a work of fiction meant to entertain, inspire, and provoke thought.\n\nThe performances are top-notch, with McConaughey delivering one of his career-best roles. Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine also shine in their respective roles, bringing depth and authenticity to their characters.\n\nHowever, what truly sets \"Interstellar\" apart is its emotional depth. The film's exploration of love, sacrifice, and the passage of time resonates deeply, making it a tear-jerker for many. The relationship between Cooper and his daughter Murph (played by Mackenzie Foy and later by Jessica Chastain) is the beating heart of the story, and their emotional reunion is one of the most touching moments in cinematic history.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Interstellar\" is a grand, ambitious, and emotionally charged film that pushes the boundaries of storytelling and filmmaking. It's a testament to Nolan's genius that he can craft a narrative that is both epic in scale and deeply personal in emotion. A must-watch for anyone who appreciates cinema that challenges, entertains, and moves the soul."

The soundtrack is timeless, how Nolan has the vision to create something like this, which resonates on so many levels I will never understand.he simply is a genius, and Hans zimmers score matches his genius to perfection.\n\nI look forward to the day when my second child is old enough to watch this film with me, the reason being they will finally learn what they mean to me.

But, Christopher Nolan sees the art of film making from a totally different perspective, this film being a vehicle for his masterful imagination.\n\nI finally get it. This film makes me feel so small, yet connected to everything. The cinematography, the score, the acting is incredible. I will rewatch again and again, when I feel I the need to ground myself and realise how incredible and fragile life is."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Interstellar\" is one of Christopher Nolan's best-known films, praised by many for its compelling story and visual style. At the same time, although the film starts out really spectacular and interesting, it struggles with many flaws. Let me break it down.\n\nNolan's direction is great, one of his most atmospheric ones besides \"Inception\". The film is visually outstanding, both the cinematography and the effects look beautiful. The performances are fantastic, especially from Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway. The film's score is brilliant, Hans Zimmer's music is incredibly well composed and without a doubt, it adds to the atmosphere. However, although the story of the film begins interestingly and engagingly, it gets too confusing at the end. The ending feels way too much and completely out of place. Unfortunately, this is the low point of \"Interstellar\", and even considering its strengths, it remained a mediocre experience for me.\n\nSo, all in all, although \"Interstellar\" starts really well, the ending unfortunately detracts from the overall viewing experience, and at the end of the day, it's nothing extraordinary."

        "review_title": "A Dumbing Down Experience",
        "review_detailed_main": "A lot of mistaken pop science and poor attention to details makes this film a dumbing experience. Films based in history, biography and science need both the writers and viewers to do the hard work of reading the appropriate research so that we are bettered by the film experience. Director's/producers need to pay attention to detail for excellence. As follows: 1. Blight is usually strain or variety specific and is easily constrained by climate variability and solved easily with cross or genetic breeding. Source and type of blights was never explained probably because it just can't happen the way depicted. 2. Dust storms would be limited to a few limited environs and would soon hit bedrock. Besides, crop rotation and contouring should have solved that problem. 3. Drone was suppose to have been aloft for years using solar panels, but no solar panels visible. Propulsion was? 4. The pulp fiction fable of no Apollo/non-moon landing event is not taken seriously by anyone who is a middle school graduate. 5. McConaughey did his famous finger rubbing thinking prior to kicking a tire but what makes no sense is how kicking a tire makes a vehicle functional. 6. Movie relied on an excessive amount of loud tonal sound effects to create drama when writing and acting just not up to the task. 7. Communicating in barcode or Morse is not how any intelligent future beings would rely on. And, later the gravity\u2013quantum equations coming from the future in Morse which doesn't have Calc encodings. Certainly not through watch hand movement. 8. Female role model in Hathaway was cast for smile/looks not for contributing anything believably intelligent. 9. Dad, Dr. Brand, also poorly cast only for accent and stereotyped science look. 10. Dropping bombs on starving people was presented as a solution \u2013 that sounded really ridiculous. 11. Looking for new Earth in another Galaxy when your own offers millions of possibilities is like looking for new home on the other side of the planet when one just like it is next door. 12. The energy required to open or even enter a wormhole would be equivalent to the total of our Sun's output for a thousand years. Also, if you can place it next to Saturn then why not closer like next to Mars to make transporting humanity easier. 13. The wormhole as well as the blackhole would shed matter to subatomic particle size. Communicating through a wormhole. Whoever wrote that has no idea of the scale of problems. 14. Speaking of Mars it can be terraformed with a few H-bombs to release CO2 to warm the planet thus melting subsurface ice to give H20 thus oxygen. 15. Turning on and off hibernation is not like opening the fridge; too many opportunities to damage cells. 16. Underground centrifuge space station was constructed of massive concrete which has only compressive strength not tensile strength. 17. Centrifuge center had a Saturn type rocket (100m high) which when blasts off should destroy that whole complex. In reality a complex that large and built underground would bankrupt half the world. 18. Those quantum gravity equations would not fit on that small blackboard. And, why are they using a blackboard in a tech world capable of traveling easily through space? Surely they must have at least an iPad! 19. So, not explained was how love brought Cooper through multiple dimensions (possibly Universes) to the exact correct time & space that Murph happened to occupy. Probably because the writer couldn't. 20. TARS sounded military dumb and those legs are not designed for surviving uneven surfaces without damage, let alone running. 21. The film's ending of throwing papers, the Eureka and the anonymous kiss was typical Hollywoodish. 22. Ranger view of Earth did not show a devastated planet but normal cloud cover; normal water and land color. 23. Five dimensional space-time is decades old-hat. Seven, nine and for the past dozen years; eleven dimensions is now the most likely mathematical construct. Remember that's all this is - a construct. 24. The effort to push books off a shelf would either be equally the same in all dimensions or not possible so that extra effort shown was just dramatic invention. 25. The interweaving of 1990s cars and other old tech, such as lap tops, all simultaneous with space vehicles & stations not yet achievable for several more decades, didn't make sense - incongruous. 26. The alternate Earth being made habitable by altering some made-up chemistry between chlorine and ammonia and their relation to N2 didn't make planetary chemistry sense, especially since such a planet would be hundred thousand times more rare than the more abundant habitable planets; also most likely more than a -100 degrees below zero. Conclusion: So many holes in this film that only a worm would love."

In all the infinity and unknown of space, there is no limit to the imagination and frankly, there hasn't been much.\n\nMovie was a little long at times, and the end, you kinda could see it coming. Theories about gravity were often weird.\n\nThe rebellious father who doesn't care about the teachers' opinions when it comes to his son irritated me a little. I found him immature.\n\nI found that people didn't care a bit when other people of team died. ''Ah he's dead, dammit! Oh well, let's continue... It seems like we had more empathy for robots. The robots were still cool though.\n\nI found that there were a few easy jokes and a light atmosphere in difficult moments and it was a bit unrealistic. As much as the film was long, the beginning was very fast, almost too fast, with the random father who overnight becomes a potential hero to save the planet.\n\nAt the end, it felt a bit like I was watching a weird Outer Limit scenario. It becomes a little cheesy, sometimes a little tryhard without really providing anything credible.\n\nI see \"best movies ever\" everywhere, I find it exaggerated. It was a good film, which entertained me. A good 7/10 for me, I recommend."

        "review_title": "A Critical Analysis of \"Interstellar\"",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Interstellar,\" directed by the renowned Christopher Nolan, is an epic science fiction film that deals with the themes of environmental collapse and interstellar travel. The story follows a future Earth facing ecological disaster, with Cooper (NASA pilot) leading a team of scientists on a cosmic odyssey through a wormhole. Their mission is to discover a new home for humanity, leading to encounters with time dilation, relativity, and the strangeness/puzzling way of the cosmos. Below, I have listed what I think are the film's key strengths:\n\n1. Performances: The cast, led by Matthew McConaughey's portrayal of Cooper, delivers performances that resonate on an emotional level. McConaughey's acting, along with Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and other cast members, infuses the characters with depth and authenticity.\n\n2. Narrative: The film ventures into the realm of complex scientific concepts and seamlessly melds them with a profoundly human story. It interweaves themes of love, sacrifice, and the survival of humanity.\n\n3. Visuals: Christopher Nolan's directorial prowess, in conjunction with cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, created a visual spectacle. The film's depiction of the cosmos, the intricate wormhole, and alien planets leaves an indelible impression. Notably, the reliance on practical effects over CGI amplifies the sense of immersion and makes it seem even more realistic.\n\n4. Brain Stimulation: \"Interstellar\" engages the audience with its exploration of advanced scientific concepts, including time dilation and the craziness that are black holes. It offers a unique and stimulating experience for those intrigued by science. This is great for someone like me that doesn't really like to sit and watch movies.\n\n5. Emotional Simulation: The film excels in evoking a spectrum of emotions, from heart wrenching separations to a profound sense of hope and human connection. The central father/daughter relationship adds a deeply personal layer to the grand cosmic story. To add to this, Hans Zimmer's musical score plays an instrumental role in intensifying the emotional impact of the film. The use of sound and silence within the vacuum of space amplifies the realism and tension in pivotal scenes.\n\nIn summary, \"Interstellar\" is an amazing movie that breaks the rules of traditional sci-fi. It has great acting, creative direction, and explores important themes that will stick with you. The film blends science and storytelling well and makes you feel deep emotions, making it a true masterpiece. If you love sci-fi and movies that make you think and feel, you should definitely watch \"Interstellar.\""

Stellar is so complex and confusing you are at the mercy of tying together so many scientific issues you get bogged down in the constant slow dialog and the dragging delivery of the twists and turns of what has got to be the most complex multi-plotted movie I've seen in years. I sensed \"overkill\" of some scenes that seemed constantly drawn out that if I had a remote I would have fast forwarded through many parts.\n\nI am a big Sci-Fi movie lover and as such I will bring huge praise to the writers and producers of well made movies of this kind. Before going to see this much anticipated film that was given spectacular and high praise from several cites such as IMDb, I was dumbfounded by what appeared to be a movie almost impossible to find fault with in those reviews. Whats more this film was much too long (2 hrs 55 minutes) including previews of trailers. No human bladder should be put to such an ungodly test. Lastly I want to again point out that many reviews are suspect in this world of questionable truths of opinion."

        "review_title": "Ambitious but pretentious and plodding, Christopher Nolan's sci-fi epic strains for greatness, poignancy and monumentality, but falls thuddingly short",
        "review_detailed_main": "How do we begin to describe 'Interstellar', Christopher Nolan's most ambitious film to date? There will probably be no doubt, once you've seen it, that it reaches for the stars; whether it manages to get there is quite something else altogether. Whereas 'Inception' showed the filmmaker's refusal to be restrained by physical dimension, his latest sees him attempt to take an even bigger leap across space and time, envisioning our three-dimensional reality as part of a larger five-dimensional whole, and employing some of the very best technical wizards to create such wondrously dazzling visuals that you cannot help but be mesmerised.\n\nBy imagery alone, it is flawless. A dying dust-choked planet Earth in the near future is depicted in a somewhat familiar yet eerily unsettling landscape of agrarian society. A single spacecraft is seen as a gleaming spark against Saturn's giant gaseous rings. Bright flashes alternate with pitch darkness as the same spacecraft enters a wormhole to emerge in a different galaxy. Each planet we explore in this brand new world is a sight to marvel in itself - one an endless expanse of water where waves rise higher than the eye can see; another is pure ice, where even the clouds are snow chunks. And amidst such surreal beauty, the one scene that will probably stay in your head for a while is that of different moments in time as a binary puzzle, meant to illustrate a key relationship in the film about gravity and time.\n\nSince his breakthrough hit 'Memento', Christopher has displayed a fascination with twisting time, and 'Interstellar' is no different. It may unfold in a largely linear fashion, but it plays with time more than you realise. On one hand, time is relative, such that one hour on a foreign planet counts for seven Earth years passed - so much so that while Matthew McConaughey's NASA test pilot named Cooper looks the same throughout the film, Timothee Chalamet and Mackenzie Foy as his 15- year son Tom and 10-year old daughter Murphy are replaced midway by Casey Affleck and Jessica Chastain respectively. That is the easier part - and then there is the scientific mumbo-jumbo that sees time in the context of black holes, gravitational singularities and the possibility of extra-dimensional space.\n\nAnother hallmark of Christopher's films has been their cerebral aspirations, but 'Interstellar' surpasses all his previous works by (over)reaching into an unnecessarily convoluted labyrinth of hokey quantum physics. To be sure, it is very serious about being serious, throwing about plenty of technical dialogue and making no apologies for assuming that its audience for smart intelligent beings. A lot of that will undoubtedly whiz by on the first viewing, but by trying to engage on such an intellectual level, it ultimately becomes the cause of its undoing with a logic-defying second half that cross- cuts furiously between Cooper in a race-against-time up in space and Murphy in a similar position back on Earth. Even without thinking too much into it, one already gets the nagging sense that it violates its very own relativity principle of one hour versus seven years.\n\nYet ironically, that is also the most entertaining segment of the film, which otherwise spends too much time (in Earth years, we may add) on melodramatic partings and monotonous stretches in space. With his brother, Johnathan, Christopher wraps the heady interstellar voyage around the bond between parent and child, or more specifically, that between Cooper and Murphy, who takes the parting especially badly; but these supposedly heart-rending scenes at the start are overwrought, and no thanks to Hans Zimmer's incessantly intrusive score, terribly manipulative. In contrast, a simple scene where the camera is simply trained on Cooper as he cries his eyes out watching years and years of backlogged video messages left by his son back on Earth is much more poignant - and without a soundtrack that instructs you how to feel.\n\nMuch as Christopher tries to ground the movie in the humanity between Cooper and Murphy, 'Interstellar' is better appreciated as an exposition on big ideas - and there are many bandied about here. Mankind's place in space is encapsulated in McConaughey's lament that \"we used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars; now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt\". Much later on, Matt Damon pops up to make an emphatic point about survival as the primal instinct, and by that, we mean survivial of the individual, not the human race. That is nicely contrasted against the motivation behind Cooper's mission itself, which his mentor Professor Brand (Michael Caine) reveals on his deathbed to be much more selfless - or selfish, depending on your perspective - than what he had initially told Cooper.\n\nSimilarly, 'Interstellar' is a film of many contradictions. It wants so desperately to be intellectual, so it grounds its science in the theories of renowned CalTech physicist Kip Thorne, but it violates these principles in favour of building a more thrilling (and complex) narrative. It wants to be moving, but it under-develops the relationships between its characters and then tries to wring emotion out of every intimate scene. And at the heart of it is an unblinking motivation to be important, to be significant, to be monumental, to matter like Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece did, and to be both science and fiction at the same time. Indeed, there is no doubt it reaches for the stars, but 'Interstellar' remains right where we are - gazing up at these constellations, and never quite getting any closer to them."

Really? With that AI robot thingie we can't automate the docking? And what oh what does docking add to the story?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo right there we could cut the movie down to about an hour, and we will only have about 40 minutes left to go. Leaving maybe 10 minutes or so that were visually interesting... moderately. There were no visual breakthroughs of any kind in this movie - zip.\n\nAnd listen, I am a lifetime sci-fi fan. So the movie had a wormhole, and some time distortion. Please, is that in itself enough to satisfy anybody who cares about this stuff or do you maybe have to elaborate and get creative?\n\nThere was simply nothing of unusual intelligence or quality in this movie. Not the writing, not the acting, not the directing, not the visuals.\n\nIn the large theatre where I saw this with hundreds of people, one person starting clapping at the end. And the crowd laughed.\n\nIf you're a Christopher Nolan fanboy, then by all means go and enjoy yourself and give it a ten. If that's not you, spend the time doing your taxes or something, you will thank me."

        "review_detailed_main": "A simply breathtaking film, Interstellar completely blew my expectations out of the water. The Nolan brothers took a huge risk in making a film about space travel, but they succeeded.\n\nThe movie was one of the most visually stimulating movies I've ever watched. Be prepared to stare in awe. Hans Zimmer didn't disappoint with his original scores for the movie as well. Just wave after wave of amazing CGI and music throughout the film is enjoyable just by itself.\n\nBut what I enjoyed most was the fact that the movie sticks to the main theme of human survival and curiosity. Everything that happens always links back to those themes.\n\nNot everyone will like the movie; some of the plot twists and more bizarre explanations the Nolan brothers came up with will leave some laughing, confused, mad, and/or skeptical. After all, it is a movie on the unknown. But, the Nolan brothers outdid themselves. You have to understand that there is so much in space physics and astronautics that humans cannot even fathom. You have to understand that what the Nolan brothers came up with could be true or not be true; there's no way to know because they came up the best interpretation for the movie based on incomplete data.\n\nTL;DR, one of the best movies made ever so go watch it. go in with an open mind and accept that humans do not know everything about space."

        "review_detailed_main": "Not so much film as much as strange milestone for Hollywood.\n\nWith A-List stars and a final running length of about 3 hours.\n\nThis in an age where Hollywood is so desperate for profit and fast turnover that even TV shows have more commercials and less content.\n\nHow is this possible? Easy answer: Nolan Brothers. Look in a mirror, say those names 7 times quickly, the Hollywood Rule Book disappears.\n\nThe bizarre length effectively gives the viewer not one but three entirely separate movies joined only by the title.\n\nThis reviewer in particular was gob-smacked by the first movie, effectively from the beginning until the space flight, and wanted to jump to an alternate universe where the whole movie took place in that small town, post-apocalyptic setting. With the dust. And stray drones. And the school teachers who taught that the trip to the moon was just propaganda.\n\nI cannot over-emphasize how strange this is. Even though that was not the point of the film, I suggest the production company unintentionally created (in that first hour) the best sci-fi future-world ambiance in the history of film; and, unaware of what they had accidentally done, they just moved on.\n\nBTW, a number of futurists have said that in the early part of the 21st century the odds favor at least one major volcano going \"super,\" or blowing for extended days or weeks. This will place ash/dust in the air will will cover the planet. Until this film, I never saw the image of what this might look like. Now I know. Wow.)\n\nThe second film is like every Star Trek film you have ever seen, but by way of Stanley Kubrick. Not bad, but nowhere near as much fun as the first portion, Another really really cool thing is the robot that resembles one of those ladder kits you buy at Home Depot, that can form a variety of shapes. Ultra cool.\n\nUntil you finally get to the third and final movie (or Act) which is meant to have profound spiritual implications but in reality only works if you have been paying careful attention for the first two and a half hours\u0085. Which is itself a strange contradiction.\n\nBut the whole film is full of contradictions. There is an Epilogue too (following the unstated theme of three Acts and an Epilogue). It is fun, it is moving, it connects with the viewer, and it makes no sense at all. There are plot holes in the Epilogue that you could lose a Black Hole in. Joke intended.\n\nSo, there you go, one of the oddest and most contradictory films of all time.\n\nOh, don't even bother trying to figure out how a society that can develop AI to a degree beyond anything ever seen in film before (the Costco ladder people) still has teachers that dispute the Moon Landing and doctors who can't deal with a cough.\n\nAs I keep saying, a very strange movie.\n\nBut a very powerful one\n\n*** REVIEW UPDATED OCT 2016****\n\nGreetings from the year 2016. For those reading this from the far future when everyone who wishes it has instant access to the IMDb database, probably beamed right into the cortex, I am updating my review with this addenda: I confess I missed the point of the film on first viewing. After all, this is a Nolan Bros 3 hr opus which, sadly, never really achieved a proper audience and now is more or less lost to time, much like the characters in the story. On second viewing, I \"got\" that this is basically a love story set against a sci-fi backdrop. The love of a father for his daughter, the growth of Man to a new dimensional experience where love itself is quantifiable - these are amazing concepts and this is an amazing movie."

But apart from most of the movies, 'Interstellar' is more than that. It is not a movie. You never realize that you spent 2 hrs 40 mins in the theater. It blends with you. It makes you a third person in the lives of the character watching then to go through all the experiences they have.\n\nThis is not a movie, this is an absolute experience that everyone should experience. It educates you, It questions you wit to the maximum level possible (How many of you understand quantum physics and Wave theory?) It raises an in-numerous questions even to the researchers who are the top in this domain, Is that possible? The answer is yes and no at the same time. For believers, it is possible as explains the paradoxes and decodes how it is possible and for non-believers, there are always questions that cant be answered.\n\nApart for science, the human connections are stupendous. It makes you to connect emotional not just to a character but to the future of the earth.\n\nAnd the best part in the movie is subtlety in the picturing it. There is enormous possibility of making it more of a scifi journey showing colorful planets etc etc. But Nolan used what is required without going for too much unnecessary visual elevations.\n\nThe science, emotions, story & the screenplay are the best in the movie.\n\nIt is an experience that everyone should experience. Question your wits !?"

While I went in expecting a Nolan movie , I was sadly disappointed. I got used to his style of movies which hold my attention throughout, and can even make me watch the movie a few times.\n\nThis movie is OK with its sci fi story. It does however drag many many times and goes very slow. A lot of drama, and less science fiction. A lot of talking and less adrenaline pumping scenes. The family drama just doesn't ever stop. The movie is too long.\n\nMaybe if the movie was condensed from 169 minutes to just 90, it would have been great !"

The Morse code, Wormholes, Spacetime can wait. you don't need to know physics at all. You just go to watch it and see the beauty of IMAX. Great performance from all those brilliant actors and actresses. And then the score by none other but the great Hans Zimmer ! But last, The Nolan brothers. Christopher Nolan delivers again. An epic voyage with lot of emotions. The astonishing cinematography is a pleasure to our eyes. Mankind is saved from destruction but it needs a great deal of courage and conviction. you get this here. Entering wormhole without violating physics is yet another milestone in the genre of science fiction. A monumental film with every aspects of life and science is depicted by Nolan."

Basically a cheap tearjerker for USA audience, cashing in on dwindling patriotism.\n\nProtip: if you want good Sci-Fi films try either Sunshine or Pandorum. They are infinitely more entertaining and closer to reality without making paradoxes left and right. Or heck even Solaris if you're really that into melodrama.\n\nI'm really disappointed in Nolan, after confused and often mind-twisting films like Inception and The Prestige, Nolan seems to be transforming into another side of Michael Bay where all Those millions are more important than integrity."

That was because the storyline was peculiar enough for me to say - I need to see how the film is going to (hopefully) tie-together. Thus that positive brought my rating up to a 4. On the negative-side:\n\n1) this movie is 2.5 hr of tedious lack-of-action. 2) most dialogue is mumbled - sounding like a new foreign language, or low in volume. 3) Those dialogue issues thus made it near impossible to follow the complex plot \"reveals\". 4) The special effects were not 2014-quality. The spaceship shots reminded me of circa-1980's Battlestar Galactica. 5) Plot problem: the pilot (MM) is enlisted to fly the spaceship because he was a great pilot many years ago. The next thing you know he's at the controls of a very complex spaceship that he has never seen. I guess if the writer suggested that the pilot went thru months of training', would have just dulled this movie further. It would be like Rocky fighting Apollo Creed, without showing the side-of-beef being hit, and running the City Hall steps.\n\nAnyway this is not a great movie in any sense. A story that tries to play on the themes of : 1) Love overcomes all, and 2) a father's love for his family can overcome the physics of the universe, are just predictable emotional-appeals (of the writer/producer) - trying to salvage something at the box-office, from the audience being left with a \"feel-good\".\n\nA great story + being well executed + an emotional-appeal = an 8 to 10 rating. This movie is just a lifeless, jumbled bore."

Interstellar is a film to completely surrender yourself to - and let the sheer grandiosity and emotionality move you. Forget logic, forget science. This is art in its most fantastical and overwhelming form. A father's heart breaks as he realizes he's broken his daughter's heart - He has left her and does not know when he'll return. Nolan pulls every string in our heart with the emotion of the father- daughter relationship set against the backdrop of interstellar travel to save the human race. Interstellar will, I feel, become more appreciated as time passes, and will, I hope, one day be regarded as one of the greatest films ever made."

Besides movie is very long, but it can not bore, rhythm grows up to the end. The photography is breakthaking, scenes are spectacular and do you not fell the long-duration! screenplay is fantastic, music is fundamental for the movie ( Hans Zimmer composed a fabulous soundtrack ). The special effects are perfect, worthy of an Oscar! Unfortunately, in my opinion, Interstellar has not had the attentions it deserves it's a film you have to see! 9/10 absolutely! not to be missed!"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Interstellar\" was and is a masterpiece. Rather than watching a film, the movie simply feels like an experience that not only requires thinking and thought process, yet also creates an experience of a variety of emotions. The film is perfectly crafted with an extremely talented cast, a deeply interesting plot and idea, a score of music that ties the whole film together with a perfect bow, and stunning and incredibly realistic visuals that make you seriously wonder if you are in the movie with McConaughey. Speaking of McConaughey, he and Hathaway simply shine, yet the rest of the cast does a phenomenal job, making the movie a powerful piece acting wise. I suggest this movie to anyone and everyone, and it is perhaps the best Nolan film out there."

        "review_detailed_main": "I initially saw the trailer for Interstellar a few months ago and immediately decided that, as the trailer painted it as a dull, rather uninspiring sci-fi epic that I was not going to part with my cash or time by going to see it.\n\nOver the last few weeks, as the promotional machine has turned it's wheels and, following many positive reviews both in the media and by trusted friends of mine, I took the day off work purely to go and see Interstellar. I have to say, partly because so many reviews and friends had said \"you've really go to see it in the cinema\". So I didn't want to miss out.\n\nI started the film, full of anticipation, that I was truly going to see a masterpiece of cinema with a great cast, engaging dialogue, a thought provoking plot and stunning visuals and, well, it had stunning visuals (apart from the external spacecraft shots looking like something from \"Star Fleet\") and, not much else. To be fair there was a LOT of dialogue. And several of the lines delivered by the robots approached humour.\n\nHad it have been around an hour shorter I could possibly have brought myself towards saying it was enjoyable but, in the main I REALLY had to try hard to enjoy this film. It's a strange one as it wasn't bad enough to be terrible but was nowhere near good enough to be enjoyable.\n\nAt one point I was truly fighting the urge to get up and walk out but didn't as I assumed we were near the end (we weren't, there was still an hour and a half to go)\n\nI love Christopher Nolan's films but this smacks of a director being given far too much praise and far too large a budget to play with.\n\nMaybe I should have taken more notice of the trailer."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not a Nolan fan but I always want to give his movies a try because mostly I do like the general ideas for the stories that are told. I really tried to watch this one without prejudice. And after it was done, I sat there with the same feeling that I had after Inception: it's interesting but there is so much unnecessary \"action\" and plot holes that it loses so much of its potential. And that's sad!\n\nThe first 40 minutes or so are really slow. After that the tempo goes up but so many details are overlooked that it becomes a bit hard to watch. This makes me very cynical and looking at the clock to see when the movie will be over. Also, playing with time is such an interesting idea but it has to be done right and you can't just be sloppy with details like I've seen more than a few times in this film.\n\nI wasn't crazy about McConaughey's performance, I kinda liked Hathaway. The visuals are good but I put on 2001: A Space Odyssey right after I finished Interstellar and to me these graphics are just as good, even though they're almost 50 years old. And the mood and eerie atmosphere are loads better! Besides, Interstellar seemed like a bit of a remake of 2001, and as is usually the case with remakes, not better than the original.\n\nI gave Interstellar a 5 star rating because of the concept and the effects."

No boring and predictable Hollywood romance! Just straight up brilliant story telling. You don't watch something for 2 hours+ and think, \"gosh, where did the time go\", if the movie wasn't that awesome!\n\nReally cringe moment with Dr Man... but we see this is in real life all the time.

        "review_detailed_main": "Yup Nolan did it again and this time he has taken his movie to another dimension.!!\n\n'Interstellar' is the story of a man trying to save his family and then saving humanity from extinction. Its full of space adventure and breath-taking actions on some of the most beautiful and unrealistic locations around the UNIVERSE.\n\nTo realize Nolan's master-piece it Is better if polish our ideas about space-time theory. We know space is defined in 3 dimensions and Einstein in his theory of relativity uses Time as the 4th dimension. But Scientists in the movie realize that Gravity has the tendency to flow across all these 4 dimensions and thus Gravity is designated to be the Fifth Dimension. It is believed that whoever holds to understand and master the knowledge of this 5 dimensions will be able to move anywhere in Time and Space. In this movie a certain species referred as \"THEY\" has the knowledge of this five dimensions and it is THEM who wants Humans to save themselves.\n\nIn the film various Scientific and Astronomical theories are used, and it will help if viewers have a brief idea about them too.\n\nMurphy's law- It is an adage or epigram that is typically stated as: Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. A statement relating possibilities with Certainty.\n\nWorm hole- It is a bridge, a hypothetical topological feature of space-time that would fundamentally be a shortcut through space-time. A wormhole is much like a tunnel with two ends, each in separate points in space-time. Though undiscovered, Some believe that wormhole could be used to travel through galaxies.\n\nBlack hole- It is a region of space-time from which gravity prevents anything, including light, from escaping. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Inside the hole what happens is still a mystery, and that's where Nolan's creativity brings about.\n\nThe movie is filled with unproved theories and unrealistic scenarios. But the way Nolan has directed it, you wont want to blink you eyes even for a moment. The graphics are, no doubt, marvelous. The cast did a stupendous job and . Though laws has been broken to keep the ending sweet, it is well deserved as LOVE has no rules and no dimensions.\n\nConclusion: Watch it again and again.. and it gets better and better.!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Similar to at least one of my fellow reviewers, this is my first review. If it happens to be my last as well, I wouldn't mind. This movie warrants a review.\n\nThe night before seeing \"Interstellar\", I had watched Stanley Kubrick's \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" which may have been the best movie of its decade/century as well. I was blown away by the beauty and grandeur of Kubrick's masterpiece, and I was worried that seeing it so soon before \"Interstellar\" would lead me to great disappointment in Nolan's film. Fortunately, this is NOT the case. \"Interstellar\" lived up to Kubrick's \"Odyssey\" and will be one of my favorite movies of all time. Nolan's movie certainly didn't surpass \"Odyssey\"; the two occupy a very different space (no pun intended) in my mind and in the annals of cinema. I can say with confidence that the two of these movies have illustrated the glory of what can be achieved in a sci-fi film, and they cause all others to pale in comparison. Even the recently- released and acclaimed \"Gravity\" has no such weight compared to these two masterpieces (another great pun).\n\nWithout spoiling any of the film, I would like to discuss some details that impressed me. The score is phenomenal, the acting is powerful, and the special effects are superb. But perhaps my favorite aspect of the movie are the apparent nods to Kubrick's \"Odyssey\" which made the dual-experience even more significant. Certain elements of the film reminded me of Kubrick's \"Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite\" sequence, the mysterious monoliths, even the legendary HAL-9000. Even with these slight similarities, so much of the movie was different, and in enough ways bolder, such that \"Interstellar\" feels incredibly fresh and original.\n\nChristopher Nolan co-wrote AND directed this film, which only further solidifies his status as one of the greatest directors of our generation. Even with his hard-to-match lineup of prior successes, this movie is a phenomenal standout. The run-time felt very appropriate, and just like \"Odyssey,\" I was pleased with how many things were addressed after what seemed like logical stopping points.\n\nPlease treat yourself to a theater experience of \"Interstellar.\" If you love sci-fi, if you love the realities of space and astronomy, even if you only love great film making, you will love this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I had a special interest in science since my childhood. I tried to read all the sci-fi related books. During the shutdown, I watched a lot of movies as well as a lot of documentaries on science. When I heard that my favorite director Christopher Nolan directed a movie in astrophysics, I was shocked. I watched it as soon as possible. Honestly, I will not skimp on rating 10/10 in each of Direction-Acting-Score-Cinematography. Moreover, it is only possible for Nolan to get impossible details in the necessary places, accuracy as well as not to drag complex science in unnecessary places or take the help of fiction in the interest of the movie. I missed some key points without seeing the problem of sound mixing and without subtitles for which I see it again in print the next day, seeing it properly, I realized that Nolan has created a masterpiece!\n\nIt will be more enjoyable to watch the movie as a drama without trying to understand it as sci-fi. Because human emotion has been given priority in many cases here. Even in some cases Nolan has ignored science in the interests of the drummer. So in the end Interstellar is more of a drama than a sci-fi, which conveys a more beautiful message about love than many romantic movies. Of all the powerful dialogues in the whole movie, this one seems to me to be the best.\n\nNot to mention the soundtrack of the movie. Some music plays with people's emotions, at the same time can bring different kinds of feelings, can put pressure on the nerves. One such score is Interstellar music by Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer, who has previously worked with Nolan on Inception, The Dark Knight, and you must remember what a terribly beautiful creation the music track was.\n\nInterstellar's cast made me even more excited about it. While immersed in the true character of True Detective, Matthew appeared in the role of Cooper, along with one of my favorites, Anne Hathaway and Mackenzie Foy, but even if you haven't seen Mackenzie Foy before, you can imagine that this box of cuteness will grow into another Jessica Chastain!\n\nIt also seems wrong to expect Nolan's movie to be simple linear. Interstellar seems to me parallel non-linear (although I doubt if there is anything with this name). Something happens before, and some happens at the same time. An attempt was made to describe the incident linearly.\n\nPeople reach a stage where they have to be developed from 4 dimensional being to 5 dimensional being. 5D sees time as a dimension so they can navigate at any time. These 5 dimensional human beings are THEY!\n\nBut time is also a physical dimension for 5D. It's like you can see all the events laid out in front of you, you can see your birth, your school life, your marriage, your death ...\n\nAs long as humans are 5D, the earth is destroyed, so they are located in another galaxy. But if they come to this other galaxy, it will take a way that was not discovered until the earth was destroyed.\n\nWormholes are a type of quantum anomaly. At the quantum level, it is seen that electrons can move from one place to another without passing any time. This concept is called wormhole. If the wormhole could be created in the form of a mass, it would be possible to pass two light-years apart almost any time apart.\n\nIt is not possible to create wormholes naturally due to the huge amount of energy and dark energy required to keep them warm and stable. But 5D people have found a way to stabilize wormholes. This time they created a wormhole and placed one end of the wormhole near Saturn in our solar system, the other end in the galaxy where future humans will be.\n\nSo this time we need to transfer the people of the world to a new place. For this they choose Murph K. Murphy's father, Cooper, is a NASA engineer and pilot, and Murphy is exceptionally intelligent.\n\nFrom Morph's bookshelf comes the Morse code signal 'STAY' which is sent by Murphy's father Cooper, a 5D Tesseract created by Future 5D Human. Because the first time Cooper enters Tesseract, he thinks he's stuck here forever, and nothing would have happened if Past Cooper hadn't been on this mission. Then Cooper realizes the power of Tessaract. Tessaradact is a 5D model, so he can navigate at any time. Grace received the necessary information about the singularity for the Gravity Equation Solve from Tarsus Black Hole, which he was converting to Cooper for Morse and sending to Cooper Murph controlling the second hand of the clock.\n\nIf space-time is continuous multiverse we can never see another universe but gravitational pull. That's why Cooper uses Gravity for contact.\n\nData from Singularity from Murph Cooper and data from Romley's Black Hole all solve the Gravity Equation, which was started by Professor Brand. It is through the gravity equation that the massive Cooper station and the people of the world begin their journey from the earth to the human new home to use gravity.\n\nMeanwhile, as soon as Cooper Murphy finishes sending all the info needed for gravity equation, the purpose of the Tesseract is fulfilled, and the 5D closes the Tesseract and sends Cooper and Tarsus back to Saturn with a wormhole. ('The first handshake as Cooper crosses the wormhole)\n\nThe Rangers found and rescued Cooper as he passed Saturn at Marfra Cooper Station.\n\nSuffice it to say, wormholes are so far only possible at the quantum level. Although the black hole was discovered, no information was found inside its event horizon. The tesseract part of the ending is completely fiction, even if it doesn't say May be 5 dimensions so far only in theory. String theory also speaks of 9 dimensions. But so far nothing has been scientifically proven. Maybe 'they' will answer these questions."

So on an afternoon in December I say all by myself in the theater to see it in the middle of the day with almost nobody around me. Probably for the best, considering how badly I bawled my eyes out in various parts of it.\n\nFirstly, the characters, both principal and ancillary, are all played with great effectivity by all the people involved. You care about these people. Not just because the represent hope for the species but because of how vested they are in mission success and in each other. You even care about TARS as well for goodness sakes, and he's a robot (but I cared about Data and Bishop too, so there's that.) The story was paced as well as it could be, considering how much story there was to tell in only 2 hours 40 minutes.\n\nSecond, if you watch it the first time it's a science fiction movie about survival, humanity, time, space, family, etc. When you watch it from the vantage point about it being a father-daughter movie, it completely changes the tenor of things and makes it all that more emotional of an experience, in addition to being a visually compelling one. Once I relayed this to my own experience as a father to a daughter of my own, my empathy level for Cooper went off the charts and catapulted this film into one of my favorites of all time.\n\nLastly and I think most importantly - THE SCORE. Oh good great goodness, Hans Zimmer has been a favorite of mine since I bought the Broken Arrow soundtrack in my high school years. But this is probably his masterpiece. The breath of the billowing organ, thrust against the ambient, dissonant and sometimes harmonious synthesizer work brings this sense of our organic essence in relief to the machinery that is thrusting us into space and enabling us to achieve greatness as our earth is failing us. This score is only more captivating with further listening and you will remember everything you felt in those moments without a single image in front of you.\n\nA great movie, delivered by an epic score. It's everything I want in the film experience."

Nolan regular Michael Caine , Jessica Chastain , Timothee Chalamet and Anne Hathaway round out the main cast. The surprise packet is young Mackenzie Foy who's daughter /father relationship drives the emotional side of the film. The robot TARS was my favourite character in the film. He was the humour and he shows human quality when all seems lost. Hans Zimmer's score maybe the best he's EVER done! Pulsating and driving and plays on the heart strings like no other score I can remember. Through the nearly 3 hours I was on the edge of my seat following the crews every move and all the while following the seemingly doomed mankind on earth. It's hard to go into specific parts of the film without spoilers. I laughed , Cried and cheered with jubilation throughout. An instant 10/10 that gets better on viewing.

A film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family, 'Interstellar' is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the Nolan brothers. Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Apollo 13', 'Interstellar' is unique in its own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen. A sheer brilliant feat of cinema.\n\nNolan's masterpiece, one of the best sci-fi movie"

It has some interesting science wrapped around a meager plot.\n\nIt may well have sky high ambitions, very good production value, actors and cgi but the underlying script is just very weak. It lacks even the most basic logic. How this can be considered as intelligent and philosophical is beyond me.\n\nThe science is heavily dumbed-down and simplified, presumably to appeal to a wide audience. The overall script is extremely simplistic. The philosophical aspect shallow and empty. The whole is wrapped into a fantastic presentation but ultimately a hollow experience.\n\nMatt Damon gives his worst performance to date (blame the script). Anne Hathaway looks lost the entire time and completely out of place. Matthew Mcconaughey flies the spacecraft like hes doing arcade games, the only thing missing is the occasional 'yeahaaaa!' like a cowboy.\n\nI applaud the ambition but overall it's a mess.

My one concern was that I've found Nolan's recent work (particularly Inception) to contain some excellent ideas and cinematography but to be overlong and rambling in places. I found Interstellar to suffer from the same faults. Very interesting ideas, great cinematography, solid cast (although I wish Matthew McConaughey would deliver his dialogue more clearly and not mumble so much. He doesn't seem to have fully recovered from his role in True Detective and I couldn't understand what he was saying much of the time and I was not alone in this. A number of reviewers have used the word 'epic' to describe this movie. I'd be more blunt and say it could have done with some more effective editing. A friend of mind made the comment that it may take several years to get from Earth to Saturn and when you see Interstellar, it feels like you're making the same trip! An exaggeration maybe but the movie is very long and lacks pace at some points. Not all bad news however - some sections are very impressive and visually spectacular, although some ideas have been borrowed from other sources - obviously 2001/ 2010 and Arthur C Clarkes story 'Rendezvous with Rama'. Definitely worth seeing but I don't share the 'masterpiece' line of some reviewers. Good but not great."

Even the heralded special effects are so clich\u00e9 at this point that they hardly add anything to this abyssal cavity of broken ideas.\n\nHere is what happened. Nolan saw some discovery channel show, or perhaps PBS, about the cosmos. He said to himself, \"I could make an adventure movie about that.\" Unfortunately for those of us who recognize good cinema from average and just slop, he couldn't.\n\nI watch zero budget movies with more thoughtfulness than this two hundred million dollar nightmare. Trade me all of the special effects in the world for one moment of realistic human emotion.\n\nAs cynical as it sounds, after seeing the 9 of 10 rating for this garbage, I question whether or not humanity would even deserve to be saved from the cataclysm."

However, the acting and casting are almost embarrassing at times and poor. The narrative and script suffers greatly from a lack of focus and pointless plot tricks. There's a sequence toward the end that while engaging, is some of the most over the top dramatic, just-for-effects senseless filmmaking you will ever see. It worked in Inception, but not in Interstellar. Overall, it is a \"pretty good\" film, but it falls short in so many categories. The visuals are worth the ride, and the best part is the presentation of the new planets. If only they would have spent more time on the water planet (that was the best part of the movie), but then if they did, every hour was worth 7 years on earth, so the story had to go elsewhere. The other graphics were good too. But there are some senseless plot turns that will frustrate you and it will lose points immediately from its' current 8.7 rating. For example, was Matt Damon's space crazy Dr. Mann even necessary? The answer when you think about it is no. It had no point in the overall story except to add more drama and intensity to an audience who already had plenty to begin with. What a waste of top level talent."

The end is completely ridiculous. I had a flashback to \"The Fifth Element\" where it was declared that love was the 5th element. Too much time spent on irrelevant side stories that added nothing. The ending is difficult to find realistic or plausible.

        "review_detailed_main": "Interstellar is the most powerful movie I have ever watched before. This experience is what should define the blockbuster entirely. A brand new idea that challenges the viewer to think, performances that can drive you to tears, editing that feels out of this world, and above all else, a music score that is endlessly watchable that perfectly captures every moment. The drama of this film does not come from a central antagonist, per se (although Matt Damon makes a brilliant villain while he is on screen), but instead, from the simple concept of time.\n\nThe writing of this whole film pairs with the beautiful graphics to seem extremely scientific, and I would not be surprised if these events could actually happen. So many of the scenes are masterfully laid out, and can be so dramatic. One of the best scenes is when Cooper is leaving, and Murph runs to her father, crying, only to find that he's not staying for her, even after she told him to go. This film is even more powerful later on, when we find out that the person knocking the books off of the shelf, telling him to \"stay\", was actually Cooper, in the future. As the music builds, Cooper is shouting and crying because he knows that this moment could have been prevented, and he would have seen his daughter grow up, but now he will never be able to do that.\n\nThis is a story about a man who sacrifices everything in his life, for everybody else's life. Learning that the mission was never supposed to succeed is a genuinely fascinating twist, and watching the betrayal on Murph's face as she finds this out is yet another brilliant scene. Matthew McConaughey is so unbelievably perfect in this film, and he seems so genuine of a person that it's hard not to feel bad for him. Every other performance in this music is so unbelievably good, even down to the minor characters. The twists in this movie are beautifully done, and make the movie shine as bright as it possibly could.\n\nWhat absolutely sells the experience is the beautiful sound track by Hans Zimmer. Every piece of music is intense, tear-jerking, and unequivocally beautiful. This movie is an absolute gem and deserves many rewatches. How on earth this film was not even nominated at the academy awards is absolutely beyond me. This is the greatest science fiction movie I have ever seen in my life, and this is certainly Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus."

This film gave me the same feeling of humility, curiosity and fascination that I had the first time I saw a film of the same genre, which was the one starring Jodie Foster and the same Matthew McConaughey, a bow and tribute to my old favourite film in the sci-fi genre \"Contact\", more than justly replaced in 1st place by Interstellar."

My friend was really angry, He was joking, that we should ask our money back. I don't felt so wrong, but: The movie was way too long, very, very loud (maybe it was only a local issue, but sometimes music was so loud, that I couldn't understand what actors told). Story was more or less OK (less...) quite predictable. Science part was below my expectations. We saw lot of similarities with 2001: Space Odyssey, but that movie is a timeless classic. This one I think I'll forget soon"

Well, not really much. But it's a fun trip getting there.\n\nI liked many of the characters. And I was invested in their problems and tragedies. But the final \"explanation\" of the film's phenomena has a \"Sixth Sense\" feeling to it.\n\nI say see this film for its good points, but don't expect the groundbreaking impact of Kubrick's \"2001\" or the atmospherics of \"Blade Runner\" or the thrilling ride of \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\"."

Sure if you watch it deeply you can never get out of the concept unless you are fully aware of the story before you see. The screenplay was really outstanding and provided the best visual. Sound - nothing to mention, it was really awesome. And about the cast, they were excellent and blend nicely into the character. Lets hope there is a sequel to this movie which suggest how she solved the equation with her fathers help and it may help me to get the story to full end.

The early sequence when Cooper hacks into the drone and controls it seems a bit awkward to me if it was meant to characterize him. And although it is a clever idea to watch Cooper observe the past (and not simply time travelling) I was a bit disappointed because the story is not consequent in the aspect of manipulating the past. On the other hand, I was intrigued by the aspect of ageing as a consequence of gravitation and acceleration and how this is incorporated in the script. What I further like about this movie is the visualization of higher dimensions. And the fact that the are no aliens, only human beings. The size and desolation of the universe that we see emphasizes the message that humanity itself is responsible for our planet."

The F/X and the cinematography are absolutely first-rate. It's too bad they're in service to a convoluted and emotionally stunted story. The cast do what they can, but there's just nothing here for them to gain purchase, and as a result I experienced a total emotional detachment throughout."

        "review_detailed_main": "Interstallar (2014)\n\nThis is a Christopher Nolan movie. So when it does what he does best\u2014shake you out of your seat with cinematic brilliance\u2014it's terrific. I mean terrific. There are effects, like the black hole, or the various spacecraft maneuvers, and even a few wild dashes through cornfields, that work so well you don't need to think about why they are happening. You are immersed, and impressed, and wowed.\n\nBut Nolan is more clever than deep it seems. A movie like \"Memento\" takes the slimmest of terrific ideas (a reordering of time in the brain) and make it amazing to watch. Movies like his Batman trilogy avoid even cleverness and work with pure energy and mythology. But in all of these there is no sense of what you would call \"meaning.\" They are entertainments.\n\n\"Interstellar\" is purely horrible science\u2014it's the butt of endless jokes on the web. But behind all the liberties and mistakes there, the movie is trying to say something \"deep\" about being human in an inhuman universe. About the special qualities humans have to be innovative, to procreate, and most of all to love. This is a bowing down to the power of love. Love conquers all, that kind of thing.\n\nMaybe it's the brother, Jonathan Nolan, who is responsible here as the co-writer. The grandiose ideas the two of them present in \"Batman Rises\" are wonderfully impossible and almost laughable if you take them out of context. (In context they're part of the whole great success of the movie.) But \"Interstallar\" takes itself seriously. Way too seriously for this kind of material and with no grip on the science, not even a hint of it. As a fantasy, it could have gone so much farther, as a piece of art based on reality, well, go see \"Gravity\" for an alternative that makes a better (imperfect) attempt to follow the rules of nature.\n\nThere is of course the plot here, saving the world, saving the species, saving your family. You have to just go with the flow here, as well, since it's all a bit romanticized in a Spielberg/Cameron kind of plasticky gloss. It frankly made me sick\u2014and yet it was so well filmed I liked it. That's the kicker\u2014Nolan is terrific with the camera, and with the vision of making things vivid and big.\n\nSee this movie for all of those best things. I saw it on a celluloid (non-digital) IMAX screen and in those portions of the movie shot in full 70mm large format, the effects were memorable. (The movie alternates between standard widescreen 35mm film and full, academy ratio 70mm, which is taller and has far more detail. The normal theater presentations approximate the effects, but in a more normal scale and resolution.)\n\nObviously this movie has won a lot of people over. I'm not sure who they are, but it's reasonable to be blown away. Nolan has openly defended himself against all the complaints\u2014as if everyone is wrong and we just don't get it. Fine. If you want a hilarious rundown of some of the many logical problems of the movie, see http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/11/08/interstellar-plot-holes/ or type interstallar plot holes entertainment weekly in google.\n\nBut what until you see it first and just enjoy it on its own terms."

        "review_detailed_main": "A good friend of mine, the writer Mark Shulman, once pointed out that our standards are being gradually eroded, so that sadly, we are left with less and less in lieu of a threshold of acceptability, finding ourselves not unlike frogs in a pan being brought to a slow, imperceptible boil.\n\nChristopher Nolan and some of his cast are telling the press that Interstellar is a love story. I will take them at their word and assume that whatever else I picked up on was left there unwittingly, for the rest of us to parse through.\n\nConsidering how much pain is involved in traveling to and from a crowded movie theater on a Saturday night, I feel like it's my prerogative, when I have paid good money, to take a film apart if I am still hungry for substance at the end of it; and I WILL get my nourishment from something or other, if not from the movie's plot itself.\n\nThe first thing that strikes me, when I think back to the experience of Interstellar, is that it leaves me with nothing, emotionally - no takeaway. I did not care about any of its characters, or believe they were real, and I did not really worry about the fate of humanity (any more than the film itself actually does, beyond paying it casual lip-service).\n\nI wasn't awed like I may have been by other wondrous space movies that Interstellar measures itself against (or steals from), and I am not compelled to go back and see any part of it ever again. (I suspect most viewers won't either, once the collective neophile contact high has passed.)\n\nFor starters, I do not like the moral core of the story: Interstellar is a film about \"saving humanity\" but it is unclear who will pay for humanity's failures. The film offers a great debate over where to repopulate, but none about what we have learned from having to leave our home in the first place. There is no therapy, no penance, no sacrifice. In a way, this represents a subconscious confession about our culture's moral failures: when we run out of spaces to consume, and out of fertile ground to slash an burn, we will have to look for new worlds to expand out into, since we cannot show self control and learn to care for what we have...\n\nBut enough psychobabble. A dysfunctional moral compass is not the worst thing about Interstellar.\n\nThe worst thing about the film is that, to quote my girlfriend, \"It's OK to for characters to talk in pseudo-scientific gobbledygook when the show is Star Trek, because in Star Trek, they all have pointy ears.\"\n\nInterstellar may be worth a glance, certainly for the photography and exciting visuals, but it is a buffet of messy ideas that fire in all directions. Clearly the script is not written by career screenwriters, but by a director who has freed himself from gravity and has achieved his own artificial self-sufficiency amid the vast nothingness.\n\nThe result is an often far-fetched and unintelligible, outlandish tale which takes an awfully long time to suspend the viewer's disbelief (and cringing), to finally arrive at a tepid plot after about an hour or so.\n\nIn hindsight, it makes perfect sense that Nolan's 'tightest' film is Memento, a dis-cognitive story told from the point of view of a man who is unable to string two events together, or to remember where he started.\n\nInterstellar is not an intelligent picture, but a pseudo-intelligent one. It seems designed to appeal to the sort of audience who loves to be flattered with cheap shots - a sort of space odyssey version of \"who wants to be a millionaire?\" Its success resting entirely on the fact that every member of the audience gets to feel superior. To whom? No one knows. This technique seems to be trending within the Nolan's filmography.\n\nFor the rest, the picture is a narrative mess that trivializes space travel on a galactic scale, (black hole, wormhole, same difference,) and is often plagued by ridiculous star-studded cameos that shatter the viewer's concentration by landing in the middle of tense emotional scenes like a cockroach in your soup.\n\nThe film is oddly timed with elliptical cuts that compress the action into some often confusing edits, and only leave in lieu of dialog some awful scenes of trite, contrived exposition, filled with emetic pseudo physics, sure to give an immature modern audience raised on Batman a sense that they are building their cultural ego by agreeing with this farce. Worst of all, it feels long and never ending.\n\nSadly, good science fiction is hard to come by, harder than a good ordinary film even, and although this picture is somewhat entertaining, it fades away from the heart and mind, like the flickering green of the traffic light we just passed, as we head home from the cinema, once more."

This Sci-fi movie had everything I want and more in a movie.... action, love, intelligence, A-Class acting and space exploration. I adore every part of this film and the AI robots that follow the characters about in the film add a wonderful touch.\n\nThis movie blew my mind back then and it still does now."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not going to review the movie, but I will review the flawed/easily manipulated Rating system this site has become. As I write this, the movie supposedly has over 12000 independent movie-going-public votes - even though the general release of the movie in the U.S. is not until tomorrow and the international release is occurring now. And, apparently, well over 11000 of those votes gave this movie a 10 out of 10 rating because the overall rating is 9.3 - that would mean that not only is Interstellar the best movie ever made in the history of cinema, but it is far and away the best movie ever made and movies such as The Godfather, Gone with the Wind, etc. are only average by comparison. There are two other possibilities. The first is these 12000 voters have seen only a few movies and they were so bad that this one seemed perfect by comparison. Or the entire voting process is manipulated by filmmakers to produce artificially high ratings to dupe potential ticket buyers. Spoiler Alert: It's not the best movie ever made."

        "review_detailed_main": "Interstellar marks Christopher Nolan's return to the silver screen since ending his Dark Knight trilogy. While Interstellar seems like classic Nolan, it also feels as if he wanted to focus on making the most realistic space film even if the story fell casualty. And it most certainly seems this way. Interstellar has the best effects that I've ever seen in a film. Each shot detailing the vacancy of space, and the planets that orbit gently is so well crafted that it almost makes you forget about the story flaws in the film. While that does remain as a huge advantage that this film has, it also doesn't delude the fact that there are some pretty glaring issues regarding Nolan's story and its characters. The story behind the film starts off as the unlikely hero is tasked with saving the planet...then it starts talking about space and the relation of time and space. While spoon feeding the audience isn't exactly Nolan's forte, it does begin to start sounding like a physics class in some scenes as characters spout off information as if it is supposed to be common knowledge. But, as Nolan intended, this is most definitely not your typical popcorn blockbuster. Interstellar demands multiple viewings and echoes early Stanley Kubrick in style and in pacing but one thing that has kept me from giving this film a higher rating is most definitely the characters. Christopher Nolan can certainly deliver us a GREAT film, his filmography speaks for itself, but Interstellar is one of his few films that features very little in the way of good characters. Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway certainly delivered the goods here in regards to their performances, but their characters themselves were very flawed and not well rounded in the least. Their characters are there, strictly to progress the story when it begins to slow down and with a running time of nearly three hours, it certainly does drag in certain scenes. However, despite it feeling long and bloated, the imagery here is more than enough to captivate you. The technical aspects of this film are EXTRAORDINARY. Everything from the beautiful, flawless cinematography to the robust sound design, everything here is utterly flawless on a technical level. It makes for a truly engrossing theater experience, if nothing else. Overall, Interstellar feels like a film that is bound to divide audiences and while I didn't love the film outright, there's a lot to this film to admire and appreciate."

The second half of the movie was somewhat better but felt like a very cheap rip-off of Space 2001. The movie just didn't do it for me at all and the acting was average. I'm totally flabbergasted that the average rating stands at 9 out of 10. Maybe audiences have lost the notion of quality, story-line, plot, acting, and uniqueness - as this movie doesn't have any of it. Ah well, I guess I'll just have to wait for the next SF movie and hope it will be somewhat better, because I am deeply disappointed by Interstellar as I expected so much more from a movie with an estimated budget of $165 million."

But, now I'm 2023, I decided to give it a rewatch solely because I constantly listen to the score. So, what did I think?\n\nI am pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed the film. The film has so much heart for a SCFI movie that it took me off guard. At its core, it's about a Father wanting to reunite/protect his Child. The story was interesting, the ending might've been a bit too optimistic and rushed but it felt satisfying to me as a viewer.\n\nThe cinematography, music, acting, sound design, set dressing, everything was amazing. Yes, there were points where I was thankful I had subtitles on. Seeing Topher Grace was also a bit odd since only associating him with That 70's Show and Venom. The visuals for the space scenes were astonishing. Truly a feat of CGI and Technological advances.\n\nOverall, there are more positives than negatives for the film. It was a great watch, the emotional beats landed for me, the betrayals were impactful, and it left me thinking more about this potential scenario."

Christopher Nolan seems to feel the need to explain to us every single thing that happens, every step of the way so we don't get lost. It becomes a little annoying as the movie progresses. Another thing that makes this movie lose a couple of points is that hippie conversation around the half way point, where Anne Hathaway says something along the lines of \"nothing is more powerful than love\". Please! Get serious! On the positive side, the last few minutes of the movie are quite spectacular visually. Probably better than Gravity.\n\nAll in all, considering the type of movies that get done these days, Interstellar is definitely one to watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "Christopher Nolen rides again with this massive scale sci-if journey story that braids cutting edge special effects, amazing performances and a supremely inventive story together to make what is sure to be one of the year's landmark films. The movie stars Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, a NASA astronaut forced to become a farmer in a world where earth's natural resources have dwindled down to nearly nil. As Cooper struggles to raise his children during what seems to be humanity's final throws, a team of scientists, headed by Nolen favorites Michael Caine, Anne Hathaway and David Gyasi, put together a daring plan to save humanity by searching for new inhabitable world's beyond our galaxy and require Cooper's skill to get them there.\n\nI really dug the hell out of this movie. As a fan of space travel myself, I really have to say that they did a great job at capturing a lot of the real math and science theory behind space travel, relativity theory and even some of the more edgy ideas about the characteristics of black holes. It's clear that the Nolen brothers Christopher and Jonathen did their homework while writing this script. The performances are also quite good here and Jessica Chastaine, who plays Cooper's grownup daughter, is especially impressive. These things married with the IMAX scope and the bigger than life special effects make this movie an absolute joy to watch. Everything is not all aces here as the film is not without its faults. Perhaps the thing I had the most problem with was the film's third act. The movie spends a long time setting up a very real and for the most part, a scientifically sound universe that is on par with 2001: A Space Odyssey and even to some degree it makes fun of a tropish, nonsensical and dumb way that the story could end as if to say, \"we're smarter than that, c'mon, what do you take us for?\" only to give in and end it that way anyway. At first I was OK with it but the more that I look at the film, the less the ending makes sense and the more the film starts to eat itself which was needless to say, really disappointing.\n\nOverall, I still liked the movie and despite my issues with the third act, I recommend it, and if you can, spring for the IMAX because the scope and scale of the visuals are ridiculous! No television could ever do it justice. This film is for sure to be in talks to win an award of some kind for special effects in the coming months and it's well deserved. If you love liked Gravity or 2001: A Space Odyssey or Apollo 13, you are sure to like this too. Interstellar gets a 3.5...out of 5."

        "review_detailed_main": "To explain my daring title - I'd like this review to be a counterbalance to many over-enthusiast appraisals.\n\nYes, it is a good action/drama. Yes, it is a spectacular science-fiction film. Every genre fan's dream: travelling among different worlds (though, try to watch Europa report!), bending the laws of \"common sense\" newtonian physics and playing with blackholes and wormholes (the space-bending explanation is just a shameless \"borrowing\" from much older Event Horizon).\n\nThough, this movie betrays the \"common sense\" in yet another way. its plot. \"We have destroyed this Earth, let's find another one.\" Irresponsibility, anyone? while we may argue - if this is not a premise of every beloved pot-apocalyptic distopia, if \"space travel\" is not what we want from science-fiction at the end of the day ... this movie dared to start with really hot topic, so boldly that it should be judged by its own \"higher standards\".\n\nSo we have an ecosystem collapse in the beginning - It is quite obvious that the reason of it are monocultures stretching towards the horizon - a direct consequence of machist, industrial, technocratic approach to science, progress, planet, life, agriculture, thinking... The root cause is so clearly visible in every picture frame of the down-on-Earth part of the movie - but the only \"solution\" offered by the writer(s) is again the technocratic one: \"Let's build super complex machines to transport us zillion light years away\" ... instead of simple (!) cheap (!!) responsible (!!!) fixing of the darned monoculture issue down on our original planet.\n\nWhile many claim that this movie is sophisticated if not even intellectual - it is not - it is actually offensive to the intellect. There might be many of the-good-old space travel operas, whom I would forgive this and spare them the \"common sense\" critique. But not Interstellar - because it pretends that it is \"aware\", \"eco-conscious\", it pretends that it urges us to think about our relationship towards the planet, but it fails exactly in this point. Thinking.\n\nWatch Avatar and Home instead."

For me it is more like feeling the movie rather than just watching it.Matthew McCaughey nailed it this time. The only thing disappointing in this movie is the way they ended it.The plot has so many holes that you can't help but notice.Anne Hathaway's one dialogue ruin its ending.'Love is the one thing that transcends time and space'.Seriously? I mean if you want to take liberty in Black hole's quantum data scene you could have shown anything but scientific.Anyway, overall its a fantastic movie ,after all its a Nolan movie. So overall I have to say this is a must watch movie in fact one of the best movies of the decade."

        "review_title": "Peak sci-fi",
        "review_detailed_main": "I will start of this by saying the negatives, which their are few of. The story can at times be a bit off-putting, or even confusing if your not giving full attention. Especially the end which I personally liked alot, but It is a bit odd what happened, and I can see it not making alot of sense for people. The acting is mostly solid but there's a couple actors in here which aren't the best, mainly John Lithgow which he does fine but not good, a few of the side characters, and child actors (though ofc it's not their fault). The shots can occasionally be odd, in how some shots feel too far away to how I think it should be, even though mostly the cinematography is solid.\n\nOnly the positives. The music in this film is not only brilliant on its own, it is so well put into the film to fit however it's supposed to be used; much more elegant ways then most films. The music is probably my favorite movie soundtrack at the moment too. The cinematography is great at almost all times, the shots on the sides of the ship I think are really cool, alot of shots spin with them, there was a shot that was intentionally blurry in here to fit the mood, and the camera shakes when it's appropriate and is usually still when not. As well I feel the more intense shots are done wonderfully, following very well if needed. Acting performance from Matthew McConaughey I think might be his best performance, which says alot, as well the performance from Anne Hathaway is really great here, and some of her best work. And this is definitely Jessica Chastains best work I've seen. Matt Damon as usual does excellent. And Michael Caine also does pretty alright, even though he feels pretty emotionless for alot of the movie, but also kinda mysterious, which can fit that character. John Lithgow does fine, good for him though, and I like how he did, just not too great. And I could name all the actors but really for the most part they are all good.\n\nThe sets on this film and effects are top notch. I've heard a lot of the space scenes; namely the one coming out of the wormhole took up to 100 hours to render each frame which definitely shows. The space shots are beautifully detailed, and the sets on earth are great because they actually grew a cornfield.\n\nThe story of this film is also great, and is executed very well. It's told like alot of Nolan movies though (memento, Dunkirk) where mysteries are introduced throughout, and explained later, and the story is kinda told in reverse to traditional stories. But the story makes perfect sense, up until the very end which I think does, but is debatable. And feels really smart, and scientific. Using actual science to explain alot of this stuff, and properly doing so.\n\nI love all the little details they added here too, like every tick on millers planet was one day, that kinda stuff is really cool, doesn't make it much better but just interesting. Which this movie has tons of!\n\nOver all I feel it's a 9.2\n\nSpoiler portion real quick for this end\n\nPeople don't like the end but it feels very right to me, it makes sense in the plot, and is explained fine, but definitely seems a bit unlikely. But feels like a good ending, everything is wrapped up nicely with a bow, and not in a all good way, but just a very nice ending. Not all is made up for at the end either. He's still missed atleast 80 years on earth. While it failed. But my only problem with it is how did they colonize so fast? Still a good ending, and I also like where they imply goes with brands story but never shown."

        "review_detailed_main": "mediocre acting overuse of dialog to explain the back-story and fake/contrived science.\n\nIt's like whoever wrote the script is some \"enlightened meta-philosopher\" (RE: psychedelic substance user)with an overgeneralized and topical understanding of astrophysics. Most people that have enjoyment studying astrophysics will be horribly annoyed watching a bunch of actors blabbering and playing \"experts\"...if you know a little about astrophysics you will find it cringe-worthy.\n\nMatthew McConaughey was mis-cast; he doesn't have a believable character in this one...same with Hathaway. They both come across as if they don't even believe the sincerity of their own lines - the dialog is very weird and almost forced at times, especially with bizarre out-of-place technical and/or scientific jargon that would never be brought up among expert colleagues (i.e. Nolan overusing dialog to inform the \"dumb\" audience about the background \"science\")\n\nIt's less of a story, and more of a writer trying to force-feed their own gnarly philosophies to whom they must deem a dull and uninformed audience. It could have been a lot more, but Nolan chose to sit on the fence as far as what type of sci-fi it would be, whether fantastical or \"realistic\".\n\nSo where's all the hype from? The liberal media that can't help but interject politics into everything...the idea of an Earth uninhabitable conforms with their world-views about climate change, so they completely overlook the actual film itself.\n\nOverall very boring...\n\nIf you're looking for Star Wars, Star Trek, Serenity, etc...look elsewhere...If you're looking for a recent watchable sci-fi; I'm usually not a fan of Tom Cruise's movies, but his last sci-fi, \"Edge of Tomorrow\" wasn't half bad...at least better than Oblivion."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm never too fussed with realism or realistic special effects in movies \u2013 after all, similar to millions of other people I only watched a two-dimensional series of images under Persistence Of Vision on a flat screen telly in a corner of my front room tonight. I wasn't actually \"there\" or wanted to be either and I have no intention of reading Einstein or praising or dissing him afterwards either. I wouldn't even bother to create a loop by promising not to denigrate with a So What that this apparently was a film produced and finished on film too.\n\nIt's a 21st century cgi cartoon update on When Worlds Collide which was a much artier and worthier film than 2001, with a nod to Close Encounters and its breathtaking nonsense taken for sage symbolism again. Convoluted plans coalesce to populate foreign countries, sorry, galaxies as the Earth or at least the American Midwest is slowly dying. It involves going through a Saturnian wormhole in much the same style as a Cosmic Pinball Wizard picking from a list of possible habitations given to \"Us\" by \"Them\", whoever that lot were. Oodles of human schmaltz is ladled on the concoction for good measure as a counterpoint to inter-dimensional gobbledygook to ensure some people's eyes don't glaze over. A few points: Playing Love Is All Around instead may save a lot of time for impatient people; director Christopher Nolan used grizzled Michael Caine yet again, he must be a really big pal; Robbie the Robot from Forbidden Planet seemed incredibly dexterous and more anthropomorphic in comparison to the clunky TARS & Co. on display as AI in here; on that bloody icy planet cool customer Matt Damon certainly had his plans well laid for saying he didn't expect to be ever opened up again; I ask again why is it so fashionable to growl and grunt colloquial dialogue in guttural whispers \u2013 I don't expect everyone, or anyone for that matter to be up to Laurence Olivier's standard of diction but we're not all Kings Of Leon fans; somewhat flat when it finally came the long expected but still creepy farewell between father and daughter! The money shots for me were the emotional and fraught Lander craft re-docking with the Endurance scenes, however it was taken so slowly I thought for a while Anne Hathaway had fainted. The cartoonery is routinely spectacular, at eye-cutting edge.\n\nBasically: as with Inception this involves a huge leap of faith from the er well-grounded but unwary viewer; get over it and it's entertaining hokum to be watched with a tesseract of salt \u2013 I switched on, switched off and enjoyed it. Way too long though, it seemed to last decades."

        "review_detailed_main": "I really wanted to like this movie, I really did. I'm a huge science fiction fan, and if Nolan had kept the \"realism\" and tone that the first hour or so promised, I would've been more than happy with this film.\n\nNolan's imagination is impressive, an expansive force that drives many of his movies. However, it is also his downfall in \"Interstellar,\" a film in which he doesn't have the satisfying answers to reconcile the realistic fiction he wants to portray. The plot is littered with points that exist because, well...science. For instance, the characters refer frequently to an equation Michael Cain's character is investigating to solve a \"gravity\" problem. But not much explanation is put for into how this would solve anything about bringing a colony of people into space.\n\nFinally, this opinion will probably cause many people to ignore me: I feel Nolan is still a very good filmmaker, but this movie glimpses him falling into the same \"black hole\" (see what I did there?) which ensnared M. Night Shyamalan. Because \"Inception\" and his Dark Knight trilogy were such a massive, profound success, he feels the need to make every ounce of dialogue ooze from the actors' mouths as if it's the most important, mind-altering thing you've ever heard. The movie becomes bogged down with long, dragging sequences of people staring as if in wonder, coming to realizations that are meant to inspire awe in us. However, these do little more than bloat an already over-long running time that felt like 7 years, but amounted to one Earth hour. The end serves up a slew of maddeningly predictable \"twists\" that were pretty obvious an hour before the big reveal.\n\nI will say the acting is done incredibly well by the cast, even if their script is not always on par with their talents. As always, Nolan is exceptional with visuals, and most of the tremendously dramatic middle portion was effective, albeit borderline overdone with sap. I could've managed without as many repetitions of Dylan Thomas' \"Do not go gentle into that good night.\" A beautiful poem that is awkwardly spouted throughout the film. A couple times was effective, five times was pretentious.\n\nThis will not deter me from seeing future Nolan feature presentations, however, it in no way deserves the IMDb \"9\" rating that it has simply because it is Nolan. I can see why people would be impressed enough by the visuals to forgo the convoluted, flawed story, but not enough to land the film in any top 250. If this exact film were released under any other filmmaker's name (besides perhaps Spielberg or the like), I can guarantee you it would be far less lauded by audiences."

A film of this scope and ambition is sure to have some narrative flaws here and there but it is beyond my ability to judge a film like this and find flaws in first viewing. May be i need to see it again to find any flaws, hell why should i find flaws while enjoyed it immensely.\n\nPerformances were great. Hans Zimmer music was terrific and loud at times. Endurance docking and ghost subplot gave me chills. Some of the stuff is hard to understand like the Gravitational singularity, Relativity and 5 Dimensional space. But Nolan connected the dots between them very efficiently and mixed them with love and humanity. If you are a sucker for these things, the film will transcend you into it or else it feels overly sentimental.\n\nDon't miss it. I recommend you to watch it in IMAX if possible."

This is by no means 2001: A Space Odyssey just as Nolan is no Kubrick, but the movie is ambitious and does have strong points. There are a lot of things that make no sense however, first, the nature of the Apocalypse on Earth is completely nonsensical, but on the other side, the oft criticized ending by the scientifically illi terate, makes much more sense than a lot of otherwise blindly accepted parts, especially if you take into account that once you go speculative, you cannot be that wrong. There is some sound strong sci-fi along the way, but a lot of nonsense points have to be given too, though many are saved by the (almost) brilliantly consistent ending, and a lot of sci-fi themes are nicely incorporated and shown, to stimulate imagination in some capable kids.\n\nThere is also a strong extra point given for respect of the father, as single fatherhood is vastly underappreciated in the wok esick culture of nowaday. The daughter \"scientist\" is celebrated despite of the fact that she entirely plagiarizes work of future generations transmitted by her daddy, which is taken as her modest denial in a culture desperate but unable to obtain wok ef reindly heroines of disciplines for which for many centuries including decades of ins ane positive dis krimination they are proven to be a bit too soft in the head for, a touche, if subtle punch that irritated the \"critics\". Extra point for Matt Damon playing a nas ty man he always seemed to me to be.\n\nOverall, a flawed but inspiring piece that can stimulate imagination and scientific curiosity in those who have it, and some emotional roller coaster for the dimw it majority."

        "review_detailed_main": "With Earth running out of resources, astronauts make a last-ditch attempt at locating other habitable planets within reach. This is possible via a wormhole, of unknown origin. And it *has* to work.\n\nAt its core, this is about the love between a father, Coop(McConaughey, an everyday man with vital experience and a good team leader), and his daughter, Murph(Chastain, independent and as stubborn as he is). This is simultaneously its greatest strength and weakness. Everything we are excited about rides, to some extent, on us, and them, caring about both of them, and what they share. Thus, we never stop caring, and it enhances all the thrilling space adventures(almost exclusively grounded in reality, and the best theories), where the mastery of movement(or relative stillness) of the camera and the volume of the soundtrack(and sometimes deafening silence) builds tension to its breaking point, and, crucially, never beyond it. And unfortunately, this emotional grounding does eventually lead to some sappy sentimentalism.\n\nThe ending will divide audiences. This owes a great, and openly acknowledged, debt to Kubrick's 2001, but it isn't a mere tribute to that, and to exploration of the stars and what that can bring, the latter of which it seeks to encourage a return to. It goes different places, and the third act will be long debated, as it deserves. The humor is well-integrated, not distracting and it eases us out of what would otherwise be relentless and unbearable heaviness. All of the effects are amazing, and the technology compelling. Watch this in the theater, it is made very much for that, as far as the visual and audible experience. The 2 hour and 45 minute running time, and that's not counting the closing credits, will scare some off, and it is perhaps too long.\n\nThere is some disturbing content and a little moderate language in this. I recommend it to everyone who doesn't outright hate Nolan\u0085 it is very much one of his films, for better as well as worse, however, even with the hokey aspects, this is one you shouldn't miss. 8/10"

I went to see this movie anyways since I didn't want to wait until it came out on blueray. I'm glad I did! There is only one thing to say to describe this movie: Mind blowing! Truly mind blowing! I had high hopes for this movie, and usually when you go in there with high expectations you almost always come out disappointed. That's not the case with this movie! It was actually far better than I had dared to dreamed about! I couldn't stop thinking about it for days afterwards.\n\nThis movie addresses some important questions. Are humanity going to stay on the earth? Is it safe here? This is a movie about the struggle to survive. But it's so much more! It's action, love, hate and even some comedy. This movie has it all! It lasts for 2 hours and 40 minutes, but not for one moment does it get boring. There are lots of plot twists that really get your imagination going. The movie makes you do some hard thinking.\n\nNot only is the movie exiting and entertaining, it's also estethicly pleasing! Breathtaking is the word of choise for some of the sceenes. Not to mention the music which complement the visuals so well. I haven't seen a movie so estethlicly well done since 2001 a space odessy. And that movie was famos for just that.\n\nIf you haven't seen this movie yet, do it now! This is the best movie I've seen in a very long time!"

But this movie is too long and dragging it seems like waste of film to make a movie this long. Why input lots of useless dialogue or scenes? The only part I like is actually the part they're not in space, as the effect on space is not really good and gets a little boring overtime. If I want to watch a movie with space, I prefer and suggest to watch Cosmos: A Space TimeOdyssey (2014), it have more awesome visual stunning effects than this movie and also more clever approach for your brain because it teaches you REAL science.\n\nMaybe Nolan is not ready to make a Space Movie. If you think this is the best space movie of all time, I suggest you watch the Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986), Star Wars and Star Trek franchises, and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). I prefer Hal 9000 over Tars for an AI."

        "review_detailed_main": "This year is not very good for the sci-fi cinematography. Besides multiple unintentional parodies of the genre (like X-Men: Days of Future Past), there was actually only one big-budget movie worth watching: On the Edge of Tomorrow. It seems like Tom Cruise is one of the few Hollywood stars able to wisely pick roles. His recent achievements leave little to desire: Valkyrie, or Knight and Day are good at worst, with the high pitch of Oblivion. Are we able to say the same about Matthew McConaughey?\n\nUnfortunately, not. Although his recent movies are above average (True Detective or Dallas Buyers Club), the latest picture he plays in, Interstellar (directed by Christopher Nolan and written by him and his brother), is a huge letdown and misunderstanding. I don't think anyone being fond of \"hard\" science-fiction stories will like it. Here is why.\n\nFirstly, the story. It is in general similar to Mission to Mars or The Red Planet, where the handful of daredevils are put in the spaceship to venture on a mission, which result will impact the whole human race. Unfortunately, which is the usual problem in this case, the whole plot is neither engaging, nor entertaining. We have a bunch of uninteresting people making uninteresting things in space. Maybe because of the long time span of the picture, the viewer quickly gets bored and does not care about the main characters. Besides, the space adventure is mixed with the very personal story of the father trying to save his children (which is also a time-consuming thread here). Anyway, the main conclusion of Interstellar is the banal statement that \"love is the most important thing in the world\". Do we really need to sit for almost three hours in the cinema to get this?\n\nBy coincidence, the second problem is the length of the movie. Currently, when the the picture is recorded not on the tape, but in the digital medium, every director tries to surpass his rivals by creating as long movie as possible. Maybe it is supposed to be the emblem of his might, skills or wisdom? I have no idea, but the fact is that the contemporary blockbusters are difficult to watch especially because they last for three or more hours, having the plot for only half of this time. This is exactly the case with Interstellar. The presented story is far from complex, and could easily fit in two hours. In fact, the first forty minutes of the movie have nothing to do with the rest of the story and could be recapitulated by the narrator in two sentences...\n\nThis film tries to treat the topic of interstellar travel seriously. Unfortunately, some ideas are presented according to our current knowledge of physics and astronomy, while others are just stupid. This mixture makes the suspension of disbelief, necessary to enjoy such movie, impossible to attain. On one side we have wormholes, black holes, higher dimensions of space and the silence of the void. On the other hand, there is totally unconvincing reality of the XXI century, where farmers are more valuable than engineers (guys, really?) and tomography is (mysteriously) gone. In one scene the physicist explains convincingly the work regime of the wormhole (by the way, this scene is IDENTICAL to the one from the far better Event Horizon). In another, we see the mission robot TARS, being the member of the crew. I know that humanoid machines from fifties seem ridiculous today (like the one from The Day The Earth Stood Still), but they are really the top quality idea compared to the robots depicted in Interstellar. It is difficult to believe someone created such a model and the whole crew agreed to put it the picture! It's almost like the the wooden planet from the initial script of Alien 3...\n\nThe number of errors and non-logical events is just amazing. Anyone complaining about the lack of consistency in Prometheus (which was also much better than this one) will have the real hunting ground here. In fact, the more time passes after seeing the movie, the more nonsenses are detected. Don't think about this too much, anyway, its not worthy...\n\nThe Nolan brothers used their imagination a little bit too much in the final part of the story, where the word \"magic\" (interchangeable with \"nonsense\") comes to mind. As the result, the viewer is left at the end indifferent to what is presented on the screen and does not care about the fate of the characters... Please recall the infamous Black Hole, and You will have the impression of what is going on here...\n\nThe music is of course the extremely important part of every picture. If the composer knows his craft, the soundtrack complements the images, creating the flawless combo (as was in Terminator, Starship Troopers, Aliens, etc.). Here we have the attempt to create the epic atmosphere, but the events shown on screen are rather uninteresting, therefore the resulting impression is just the overwhelming noise, making the viewer angry instead of touching or moving him.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems like making a good movie about the interstellar travel is extremely difficult. People like to go to the movies and see a good story. There are multiple requirements for the entertaining movie: the mystery, the convincing scenery, the real characters we could care about, finally, the emotional strain, often related to the dangers our protagonists are exposed to. Interstellar does not offer anything of these. It is a long and boring sermon about the future of Mankind in the universe, pretending to be the science-fiction movie. With this picture Christopher Nolan proved his only memorable work was Prestige and the Batman trilogy was not the accident, but the clear sign that his main achievements in Hollywood will be too long, boring and utterly disappointing pictures, initially rising hopes for a good time spent in the cinema, but leaving in a complete, sad disillusion after all."

        "review_detailed_main": "Interstellar- An inter galactic space travel to other galaxies through worm holes by other dimension of time using gravitational physics mixed up with time warping and relativity concepts. yeah yeah.... by now you can understand the depth of the movie which Nolan wanted to show the world in his latest offering. I went to the film with maximum expectations and it exceeded in every aspect. The plot is quite simple. but the way of execution is complex. The film starts off on a smooth note and the excitement increases as the movie goes. I liked every bit of the movie. Matthew McConaughey is awesome throughout the film as his expression in some particular scenes leave u in an awe. Marvellous job by him to carry the film. All the lead cast played exceptionally well.\n\nPeople are asking me whether it is of Gravity range??? I simply asked them back why do u want to compare this with that?? I seriously don't like to compare two movies even if they are of the same genre. I don't want to play a spoilsport here so I'm not revealing or jotting any plot lines here. The screenplay, as usually by JONATHAN NOLAN, is very gripping and he surely does a remarkable job with the script too. Another big gem for the film is its BGM. What can i say about Hans Zimmer which u already don't know? The BGM gelled so well with the movie that u almost think the BGM is a representation of on screen presentation. Some scenes got much elevated by the impeccable work of Hans. His use of instruments and strings require a special mention. Especially during the final 5-10 minutes of the movie, the BGM is so good that it almost left me speechless and haunted me the rest of the day. A huge respect to Zimmer.\n\nComing to my movie God CHRISTOPHER NOLAN....... There was a time when i thought what if a directer directs only Gentlemen Class movies and not the silly stuff to hang around the industry. Then i came to know about Nolan and his works. At first i was thrilled by his taking and got attached to his movies so much i cant think of not expecting a better output from him in his next.... He is a master in movie making and a true gentlemen movie maker. The reason i used the word Gentlemen Moviemaker is that his works needs to be understood but not only watched for time-pass. Every dialog in his movie has a meaning and every frame in the movie has to do something with the plot. In Interstellar, he once again showed us why he is such a remarkable movie maker and a splendid director by delivering the most spectacular experience of a space travel. The depth of the plot is so well handled. Every frame counts and every dialog has a reason. He never even wastes a single second of the film with unwanted stuff. As always, the story is to the point and goes on increasing the intensity exponentially. If i say more about the plot, i may spoil the experience for some who didn't watch it yet. So all i can say is that this movie is masterclass in every aspect.\n\nFinally, dedicating his own dialog from The Dark Knight to him, i would like to say..... He is a silent guardian of movie making..... A watchful protector of the script...... A DARK KNIGHT of the industry....... I salute him with all of me and expect many more top notch directional ventures from him.\n\nP.S.: I pity IMDb accepts only 10 stars(It may be my exaggeration, but this is what i feel). Like"

Outside, people were busy discussing the movie that they have just seen\u0085it is a rare sight! I was trying to analyse and understand what I just saw.\n\nI need to see it another two times at least to understand this amazing movie better! I need to understand the science the movie has spoken about before I can try to understand it! Nolan has gone a step beyond what we have expected out of him with this movie. I am amazed at how he can reinvent himself every time! Unlike other Nolan movies, this one is strong on emotions as well..at the core it is father - daughter relationship. We had seen only a glimpse of father -son relationship in 'Inception'\u0085this one could bring tears to your eyes seeing the performance of the actors. I don't like to give away much\u0085 Some pointers by me..\n\nYou need to brush up science and know at least the basics like time, black holes, relativity, gravity, etc to understand the science part of this movie.\n\nDo not spread spoilers on this movie\u0085let everyone go into the theater with no knowledge of this movie to be amazed like me! Watch it 3 times or more times to understand it better!"

They fly off to find some previous scientists, who have entered a black hole and settled on several worlds possible for human habitation. Matt Damon plays one of the scientists.\n\nYou have to like black holes, relativity, and the fifth dimension (not the pop group) to appreciate this. I didn't know a thing about this film beforehand, so it was a nice surprise to see Michael Caine pop up. And when William Devane showed up, I instinctively blurted out \"What's in your safe?\"\n\nThe special effects are fine, but the characters are more interesting, and you do want to see how the situations get resolved. McConaughey is good, but he mumbles on occasion, which drives me nuts. I liked the music score, but at times it drowned out the actors."

And that was the reason I wanted to see this film, to see what plot hole he had this time and yes they are a plenty.\n\nI will still give credit to where it's due. He really wanted to make a head scratcher and this time with the laws of general relativity which the film does closely follow. Basically the emotional device here is that Matthew Mahogany traveling at a fraction of the speed of light through space makes him age slower than his kids and basically its a race against time.\n\nHowever the Nolan-isms come full circle with not-so-subtle foreshadowing, overly pretentious unnatural dialogue, heavy-handed symbolism, a really ear-ringing Hans Zimmer score which make the Inception horns sound like and an unnecessarily long run time.\n\nI can see that this is a script he didn't really have time to think through but you can see he tried and its still pretty entertaining. However it's no 2001 A Space Odyssey. He should stick to thrillers. Sorry."

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched this movie a week ago as of this writing and purposefully have waited to write this review and not be biased.\n\nFirst of all the first thing that crossed my mind when I left the session was how much tense Interstellar was. It mesmerized me especially after the crew went to space and it never stopped until the film had ended. I was genuinely curious through the whole film of what was going to happen next. The action scenes were memorable. At times the silence, the pure silence, in some scenes was creepy and I felt that I was genuinely with the crew in the space.\n\nThere have been a lot of criticism by people to this film because the answers that it gives are \"simple\" and \"cheesy\". When watching the trailers of Interstellar one of my greatest fears was that it was to dramatic in a negative way by some dialogues like \"I'm coming back. When?\". But after seeing the film I was satisfied with the answers that it gave me. In a way you have to be open minded to watch this after all the answers, although simple, are not conventional in anyway and this is, I think, the main reason why so much criticism. But I'm truly opened to accept that when we, as humans, don't know what happens at the first time we do something, the sentiment of fear dominates us.\n\nI truly recommend people to watch this movie called \"Interstellar\". For me it was a complete experience which I had not experienced before in the cinema. Maybe you will be troubled by some, or a lot, of the answers that the movie gives, but I think that the visuals on its own are a sufficient argument to see this. I recommend you to relax and not get worried trying to understand everything. It's difficult and maybe you'll get frustrated of how hard, at times, it gets. At the same time it is paradoxical how simple the end is.\n\nThere are some things that people tend to agree both critics and lovers of Interstellar. For example, that the film is really ambitious. Personally I love when people try so much for something different and outside of the commonplace that we watch everyday and I liked very much those aspects of the films. There are some flaws of the film ? Probably, almost every film has it. Moreover, we, as humans, make a lot of mistakes most of the time. I also think that the aspect of error is being under-appreciated by some viewers. Even in the end you notice how hard and lost you are. But the brilliance, something that really captivated me, was the fact that for this complex problem a \"simple\" solution was given. How beautiful it is when you take a shortcut and resolve a problem in a way which ever be made before.\n\nDon't miss this. Love it or hate it, worth the time of watching in a big screen with the sound loud and tense. For me it was a true experience and I hope that you feel the same as me. Cheers."

After some 80 years of being addicted to movies and being a fan of Science Fiction from the days of Astounding and Galaxy, very few films have lived up to expectations. \"2001\"\" the best of the lot. The mix of sugared family relations and hand-on-the wheels spaceship driving like a racing car plus some probably very expensive gadgetry was too boring for me, sorry, I did not last the fulll length and had to find my own wormhole like fast forward to the finish."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's exceedingly rare for a film to make me forget it's a film - but Interstellar managed to knock me out of my senses in a way I had never imagined.\n\nHere's the thing about films like Interstellar: the experience of these films starts way before their release, and lingers on in your bodies as a wonderful sensation way after they are over. Christopher Nolan, god bless that genius, announced Interstellar a week after the release of TDKR, and since then, we his fans have driven ourselves mad trying to figure out what Nolan would do with Black Holes and Time Travel and such alike - and what he does is not only brilliant, but beautiful in unthinkable ways.\n\nI really need a second viewing to fully be able to appreciate the technical elements of the film, because after a point, really, I was too immersed in the whole experience of it to bother paying attention. But the cinematography, editing, visual effects, set design, the score (Oh, Hans Zimmer!), Nolan's direction, the performances, all combined into a powerful 3 hours that transports you to another universe for the whole time. They did their jobs perfectly so honestly I wouldn't be able to find a flaw.\n\nSome have criticized the sound design but I disagree: it was all just so beautiful. So perfect.\n\nNolan raises so many questions in our minds and answers them so beautifully as time goes. I loved this. I absolutely loved this and I implore you to go and watch it and experience and understand what cinema is really, really about.\n\nFor those who have not seen it, please do not read on. Just go watch it.\n\nA solid 12/10 - because yes, it dares to go beyond.\n\n***SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT***\n\nLet me shrug off the criticism against it: the emotional quotient - 'Love'. \"Love is the one thing that transcends time and space.\" It's been said by many that the emotional quotient of this film takes away from the 'other' parts of it, however, the 'many' may not have fully understood what Nolan was trying to say. Think of love as a physical being - an actual something that literally 'transcends' time and space - think of love itself as the fifth dimension beyond time! This whole wonderful journey is the process of understanding this truth, told through the stranded relationship of a daughter and father. Being a student of philosophy myself, this whole concept visualized with scientific rationality is a kind of dream-come-true for me. It is not a film for the pleasure of viewing the film - it raises and answers in its own logic the questions that humankind is yet to find answers to in real life. This film is a realization in the purest sense - this film goes beyond itself, beyond the concept of being just a film. Nolan does the unthinkable: in the never-ending debate between religion and science about the ultimate source of energy for the world, Nolan finds a middle ground.\n\nThis film is Revelation. Wow. Just wow."

The acting is incredible and the score just superb.\n\nThe level of depth this film has really has an affect on you for a long time afterwards.\n\nIt will take an emotional toll on you so be prepared to have a good cry.\n\nThis is a movie you definitely need to sit down, and pay attention to while watching and I guarantee you will be so rewarded for your efforts.\n\nIn my top 5 favorite movies of all time."

The music in this movie was almost perfect to the story. I don't think there is anything majorly wrong with this movie. The docking scene in this movie was I think the best docking scene out of any movie. This movie will go down in history for being in the top 3 best sci fi movies ever. Good job. :) This is in my top 4 for best movies i have ever scene."

But the truth is this movie was not only a masterpiece in sci-fi cinema, but it was a masterpiece as a movie in it's own right. I am writing this review in November 2021 having just finished Interstellar again. I believe this is my 3rd watch. I am one who likes to savor movies and take my time to dissect every angle; and even now, this movie still stands the test of time and will for many years to come. The combination of Zimmer's score and Christopher Nolan's direction/story telling was just a match made in heaven. Everything was beautiful crafted, well paced and we'll delivered. The score will haunt you long after you're done watching this. Masterpiece as a word doesn't do this movie Justice. Death we know is inevitable for everyone but while you are here, watch this movie. You will be glad you did. As a word of advice try to avoid spoilers. A perfect 10/10 for me."

        "review_detailed_main": "Honestly, I was expecting more from Christopher Nolan. The man is capable of unique vision, of scope that comes across only every once in a while. Such as seen in Inception and The Dark Knight. But this? This is still a good movie, but that's all. It's not great, mainly because of limitations in storytelling, dialogue and style.\n\nThe biggest problem is that Nolan's faults shine through more than usual. His over-reliance on exposition dialogue, his longwindedness and tendency to linger too long in certain scenes. In most of his movies you get the sense that he had one idea too many. Well, in this he had easily two or three ideas too many. This could have been a two hour movie, without a doubt, and it would have been better for it.\n\nIt also seems to have problems deciding what it's trying to be. Is it a hard scifi epic along the lines of 2001: A Space Odyssey, or something more leaning towards drama and so called space opera. Certain scenes lean more towards the former, some towards latter, and they don't mesh at all.\n\nThat being said, it's a fine movie. First of all, it's absolutely gorgeous. I have slight problems with the designs of the actual planets, but every single shot of space is jaw-dropping. I also like that they went and paid actual scientists to figure out what a black hole might look like, among other things. That shows dedication and certainly makes for a very memorable visual.\n\nThe cast is also superb. The problems with the characters stem from the script, not the actors, and all of them have great chemistry together. One of the underlying themes in this movie is the relationship between father and daughter. Both Matthew McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy, as well as Michael Caine and Anne Hathaway make for a great pair and I have no complaints about their performances.\n\nAlas, I just cannot call Interstellar a great film. The ending alone would ruin it for me, but the whole journey is so needlessly long and slow that I never got into it. The movie has a lot of good ideas - the dying Earth, the robots, the black hole's affect on space-time - but those ideas are poorly realized and the whole just isn't as good as Nolan's previous work. It's worth watching, certainly, and it's not a bad film, not at all. Just a deeply flawed one."

The acting is OK but not Oscar winning - in fact some of Matthew McConaughey and his Texan drawl does get a bit tiresome by the end. The story itself inspires much thought, but not in the same way as Inception - that is quite a good thing really as your brain doesn't have to work quite as hard to keep up. Seriously it is an OK film and a good watch, albeit a tad too long - but the last 20 minutes is weird, a little rushed, and could easily be dropped. Don't let my comments in any way put you off seeing the movie, but please don't expect 10 out of 10 unless you are very easily pleased."

The attention to detail in the visual effects is mind-blowing, making every moment feel incredibly realistic. The vastness of space is beautifully portrayed, leaving viewers with a sense of wonder and insignificance in the grand scheme of the universe.\n\nThe story itself is a captivating blend of science fiction and human emotion. It explores profound themes such as love, sacrifice, and the boundless nature of human curiosity. Interstellar takes its time to delve into complex scientific concepts, making it both intellectually stimulating and emotionally engaging.\n\nMatthew McConaughey delivers a mesmerizing performance as Cooper, a former pilot turned astronaut. His portrayal of a father torn between saving humanity and his own family is deeply moving. Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, and the rest of the cast also deliver exceptional performances, adding depth and authenticity to their characters. The film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer, is nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nInterstellar is not just a movie; it's an exploration of the human spirit and our relentless pursuit of knowledge. It challenges us to ponder the mysteries of the universe and our place within it. This film will stay with you long after the credits roll, leaving you questioning the boundaries of time, space, and the power of love."

The ideas in the film are very intriguing and make you think for hours after you first view it. Upon rewatch the film becomes even more fascinating because of all the things you might have missed the first time through. The emotion showed throughout the film also improves the story greatly. The stakes of what they are trying to accomplish are shown with this emotion with Matthew McConaughy and Anne Hathaway standing out with their stellar performances. But, probably the most impressive thing about this film is the cinematography and visuals. The visuals are some of the best of any film ever created and are something that really impacts you.

I did appreciate that a lot of philosophical questions arise as one watches this movie regarding humans place in the universe and the physical size of the universe and time. On the other hand, I also had the feeling that I was watching an updated version of \"2001, A Space Odyssey\" particularly with the sequence through the wormhole in this movie versus the Stargate in 2001. Also the similarity of the rectangular shapes of the robots to the obelisk, and a few other minor similarities.\n\nAll in all, I felt this movie was okay, but far from great, and probably will not watch it again unlike some other sci-fi movies including the aforementioned \"2001, A Space Odyssey\"."

Anne Hathaway, was also brilliant, she is extremely versatile. Jessica Chastain really shined in her role, and Michael Caine really added so much so to the movie.\n\nPossibly my favorite movie of all time. The aspect of forcing the audience to think really makes you feel involved with the story and the science of it. Though it can be slow at times, it is still amazing visually and it has tons of emotion. I'm so glad it's so scientifically accurate, and I'm also glad Kip Thorne helped make it so.\n\nA must see.

There is also much adventure in the space mission and the right amount of sentiment of a family being separated. Matthew McConaughey shows brilliance and depth in a scene where he quietly shows how much he misses his loved ones. Playing his school-age daughter, Mackenzie Foy is no slouch either.\n\nThe second half is interesting at best; muddled, too busy and overlong at worst. There is also a major characters whose fate is left unknown to the point of almost being trivialized.\n\nThe movie is good in many ways but had the potential to be more."

I like it simpler, but I can enjoy more elaborate movies, though, Nolan's MO is just so recognizable that you can't help to identify the issues while you are watching. His opulent screenplays paired with stunning visuals and grandiose music scores push the inconsistent characters in the background and the plot is kept ambiguous enough to never fully commit to one story and Interstellar is no different. Still it also had a few things to it I liked, for instance, the story concept itself or omitting sound effects in space scenes (like it would be in a real vacuum) or touching on a few political topics with current relevance. So all in all, it's worth watching if you have 3 hours to spare."

I thought that maybe when they go in space things could get better... well, they did for a while but then the crew landed on the Ice covered planet and things got pretty sour.\n\nThe idea of Cooper getting into the dimensional space and wrapping the story with the beginning was good but then again the end was OK and obviously left for a 2nd film.\n\nThe sound was not good at all - I could barely hear and understand what they were saying, so maybe 50% of the films sound was a high pitched music overpowering the scenes.\n\nAt the end I thought - this is a film for people who doesn't like sci- fi movies, don't believe in life in other planets and are narrow minded and believe only in conventional science. I suppose they got to watch something like that and like it...\n\nI appreciate the effort of everybody involved in this creation but it's not for me."

The most important message it wants to tell us is to grow beyond us and to face the challenges we are most afraid of. Furthermore, sometimes you have to sacrifice something in order to achieve your goals (Newton's third law).\n\nThe cinematography is one of the most beautiful of all time which leaves you in awe, the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is simple, yet absolutely breathtaking.\n\nAll actors give great performances, especially Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, Mackenzie Foy as young Murph and Jessica Chastain as adult Murph.\n\nChristopher Nolan crafted something special with this film, invested a lot into research for scientific accuracy, which he used to show us never before seen images which are revolutionary and raise new standards for future space movies.\n\nA must watch!"

We don't know anything about the planet except for the slice of life of a dozen people. What happened to the weather patterns? Strike one. How does the space team manage to get their hands on all the fuel needed to launch multiple rockets if there is not even enough food to feed whoever is left on earth. Strike two. The middle of the movie was the best part. Their journey was engaging and scientifically reasonable. The ending with Morse communication was snake oil and mirrors. Where did that multi-dimensional structure come from? Seemed like it came from 2001 Space Odessey. Strike three. The plot leaps from grounded science to Twilight Zone too often for me. Before the movie I was wanting to give it a high grade, but I don't think I'll even watch it again. Anne Hathaway bumps it up a notch."

Director Christopher Nolan shows us a dystopian world where dust storms have destroyed Earth's crops. The situation is so bad that the government decides that mankind needs a new home among the stars. Matthew McConaughey plays the leading role as the brave astronaut chosen to save mankind. One of the best movie ever made, must watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "The first time I watched this film I felt extremely underwhelmed. It was boring, dragged out, and too confusing, and I stopped watching before the 3rd act (which Imo is the best act). Maybe 2 months ago I rewatched it, thought I would give it another chance, and it was soooooooooooooooooooo good! The performances were great, the story made sense, and it was one of the only films where I was completely immersed to the screen (along with Jurassic Park, Aliens. 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring). The visual effects are extremely good, and the writing was great. I felt that the second act was a bit flawed in terms of scripting and directing (imo the weakest of the 3 acts), but is still fantastic nonetheless. Interstellar manages to make you completely immersed into the screen, which only very few films can do. This film truly shows the genius of Nolan making him my second favourite director of all time (favorite being Spielberg). Hands down one of my top 5 films. Hands down the best Christopher Nolan film in my humble opinion (The Dark Knight being a close second). One of the greatest-epic of all time, hands down."

I watch it every year in April around my birthday, and this year was no exception. I have seen it eight times now and it is still fantastic. I get chills and I cry every time.\n\nThe acting is phenomenal, and Matthew McConaughey is one of my favourite actors. The story is well-written and it also raises so many questions about space and our place in it. The pacing is perfect. The movie gets more and more interesting and exciting by every minute, and there are a lot of minutes in this movie, 169 minutes of goosebumps! It has one of the best endings I have ever seen in a movie. It's so emotional. The first time I saw this movie in the theaters, my mind got completely blown away.\n\nIf you are a fan of Christopher Nolan and interested in space, you have to see this movie! 11/10!"

Well now if we remove the music we see that it is longer. And maybe it will be boring for the audience who likes this big movie several times. The final sequence of the film turns into a package full of long shots. Such a show is repeated in different parts of the film. Even in the views we have from space.\n\nNolan sprinkles a silver and gold color on these shots. Men in spacesuits look much bigger than normal. Matt Damon is not believable enough. But it is good. The sequences size are too long. Nolan tries to make it bearable with music, but he doesn't succeed. I am not against this. But this work also requires a slower rhythm. The pictures are very beautiful. And they often don't look like promotional teasers..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Like everyone I was psyched out of my mind for interstellar.I was further psyched when I took a look at this movie's rating on IMDb after it's release.This movies has some good elements but you can clearly identify some of the cons of this movie. The best thing about this movie is Matthew McCounaughey who is simply on a roll. His acting was phenomenal. The supporting cast was also great. This movie has a really strong ensemble cast. The score by Hans Zimmer is really good especially because it merges fluently with the dystopian atmosphere of the movie and the visual are a treat for the eyes along with the cinematography. The direction is good and has Nolan's innovative touch.\n\nNow with the negatives.First of all this movie is confusing to the average movie goer. It is confusing because it uses a lot of fancy words and scientific terms to cover it's not-so-interesting plot.The movie tends to drag on and the dialogue is not that great. Also the movie is too complicated aside from the terms used in the dialogue. It is proof that just because a movie is different and overly complex ,it isn't great or 'stellar'. The movie is a bit boring and tries too hard to impress the viewer by further complicating itself and doesn't quite succeed in it."

The spectacular Screenplay from the Nolan brothers along with Han Zimmer's Music makes it a masterpiece. The screenplay itself has many layers to it. Film has beautifully portrayed the relationship b/w a man & his daughter as she grows up. My only regret is not being able to watch this movie with all its spectacle in pure 70mm IMAX. Last scenes makes even the strongest of minds to cry."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm going to admit I'm not the biggest fan of Nolan's work. I don't consider him a bad director, it's just his kind of work it's not for me.\n\nInterstellar is not an exception. Continuing in Nolan's line, the movie has a long, long introduccion. Yeah, that's not necessary bad, but the problem is you could quit 20 minutes and it wouldn't affect the main characters. Of course, you must to know what you have to dispense.\n\nYou can see a little poetry in McConaughey's character. As the movies moves on, the character gets tired and so do the actor. Not something bad, even it can be very cool for someone, but I just don't like to see Matthew tired of acting in some scenes in the second but especially in the third.\n\nYou'll see I'm not criticizing bad things. I'm just saying things that I don't personally like, so it's my point of view.\n\nSometimes the movie tries to blow your mind. And sometimes It makes it. For example, with the last scenes. So, what's my point? My point is that if you're a Nolan fan, go and see the movie. If you like some space misteries like my case well... maybe you don't get as much as you want.\n\nThis is just a Nolan movie. And this is just my opinion."

I need to go to bed but how can I even though I have a copy I can watch any time?\n\nThis film is by far one of the greatest I have watched. It just does something for me, I love my sci-fi, that helps. I'm not a film critic, I'm not able to analyse a film to depth of someone qualified to do so by title, but I love my films and I love being immersed in something that surrounds you entirely. The score (listen to Hans Zimmer's soundtrack on its own, track 8.... mountains...), the cinematography, the worlds created, the scenes on the planets, the black hole, the seemingly interlinked relationship between the earth story and the space story, and most of all, the homage to Arthur C Clarke. I'm not sure why he isn't referenced or out there in discussions that I can find, but a large part of this film was written by him (indirectly!), anyone who's read Odyssey or Rama will know this. What Christopher Nolan has done to make this his is amazing in its own right.\n\nI know there are some critics, but for me, this film was 46 years in the making and I can only thank Clarke and Nolan for it."

'Interstellar' only delivers the vacuous pretension one would expect if a Batman director thought he could eclipse Kubrick's '2001' with an implausible adventure story. Christopher Nolan's new film begins inauspiciously and steadily declines as its long-winded prologue introduces the Hollywoodian elements of a Steven Spielberg/Norman Rockwell Sci-Fi co-production - a widowed ex-astronaut farmer, his chiseled jaw, a feisty daughter, a crusty grandpa, baseball, dust storms, a dying Earth, paranormal activity, cornfields - and lots of corn.\n\nAfter about an hour - which seems like two - a valiant crew lifts off in search of a planet to save humanity. Once they've journeyed through an interstellar wormhole, the far-fetched nature of the tale expands to cosmic levels. Nolan's need to overwhelm his audience with awesomeness is so powerful that he forgets to tell a believable story. Scientific hocus-pocus is stirred into the sentimental sludge as gigantic tsunamis, frozen planets, deranged scientists, spaceship chases, time travel tomfoolery and black hole baloney eventually lead to a schmaltzy Hallmark-level climax. The visual effects are above average, but diminished by the cheesy melodrama of the narrative. When all the film's 'Sturm und Drang' has died away, self-importance and mawkishness are the abiding impressions."

Nowadays I maybe watch 2 or 3 movies a month and rarely watch something I've seen before but this here is the kind of movie that deserves a rewatch, and another and another. If you've never seen this, which would be weird since it came out almost 9 years ago, then you are in for a treat, granted it will be a bit of a depressing treat but a treat none the less."

As a former 14-year-old sci-fi fanatic, this movie was laid out in such a way that people will understand. While science might not be everybody's thing, this film touches the subject of family and survival; something everyone can relate to.\n\nIt's a great tear-jerking film that makes people question what they know about the universe and all the possibilities it offers. At some point of the film, it will also make you question your morals and empathize with the characters.\n\nInterstellar is a thought-provoking piece that I think is a must-watch for everyone, especially Sci-fi lovers."

These scenes are rather few in number, but are placed in strategic times in the movie, giving it its peaks at the exact time you need it.

Lastly, his theory about creatures in the 4th dimension and the dramatic atmosphere that dominates the whole movie bring the movie to the top. My favorite nolan movie.

I also would like to not that a vote of 9.5 is impossible for some reason and I think that is insane. People say all the time sci-fi is a hard genre and I disagree. The truth of the matter is space is a hard subject to make an interesting movie about.\n\nIn this movie the only problem is if you have seen Gravity you at least got to look at a beautiful woman on the screen for quite some time. This movie (I have to be honest) Anne Hathaway does not look her best. Which makes sense because how can someone expect to look like a top model while spending so much time in space? Any who I had the pleasure in seeing this movie in 70mmm IMAX film and let me say I highly recommend it. I wish all theaters or at least all of the people wanting to see this film could see it in 70mm. I felt like it was the way the movie was intended on being viewed. Overall great movie for the fans of space.\n\nThis movie is the dream of any kid that has ever dreamed of space. My second and last tip for those who have not seen the movie yet, is pay attention from the first minute to the last. You have to pay attention or you will miss something. Which we should all know by now since the Director is Christopher Nolan."

        "review_detailed_main": "Interstellar is an interesting, thoughtful science fiction film with a good cast. It depicts a near future where an environmental disaster has sent Earth into an irreversible decline, forcing humanity to seek a new home in another galaxy. Although it is not as good as Christopher Nolan's other work, it still rises above most other blockbuster, high budget sci-fi.\n\nA number of factors make Interstellar better than average. First of all, it avoids the clich\u00e9d film apocalypse with lots of CGI explosions and a central villain. In this movie, the world dies not with a bang, but a whimper as our food crops gradually die out. It also gives interesting consideration to the social effects of such a catastrophe. More importantly, it treats the audience as at least somewhat intelligent. Although I'm certain Neil DeGrasse Tyson could pick it apart on Twitter if he so desired, the film attempts to be somewhat scientifically plausible, incorporating relativity theory and even a mathematical equation as major plot points. It's disturbingly rare for movies in recent years to aim at an intelligence level above that of a thirteen year old.\n\nThe film also benefits from good designs of its space ships and robots. The robots deserve particular mention. Rather than the typical humanoid looking designs, the filmmakers created a genuinely original, even plausible robot.\n\nThe main weak point in the film is that it tries to insert too optimistic an ending, when the story really wasn't building to one. Nevertheless, it is well worth watching."

It takes one hour just for the space mission to start.\n\nIt's slow paced and VERY sentimental, or, in other words, most of it is boring.\n\nI'm not an English native speaker, but my English is not bad either. I have no problems watching movies in English, and yet it was very hard for me to understand the main character's mumbling in his farmer accent. All other actors spoke properly, except him, the most important one.\n\nThe plot is not very logical: Planets just in front of a giant black hole?! Yes, this must be the place to live everybody is dreaming of.\n\nImagine your colleagues in the space station would say to you: \"OK, we're now ready to fly down to that planet. You wait here. Don't worry, we'll come back soon, in... some YEARS!\" You'd probably smile and say: \"Wonderful! OK, go now!\", right? One day they come back and are probably surprised to see you haven't committed suicide because of depression, even though you waited 23 years (!!!) for them. You must be the most patience man in the entire Universe.\n\nAnd again a female \"scientist\" who looks like a model and behaves like an amateur. An obligatory part of every sci-fi movie nowadays.\n\nThis is just to give you an idea. There is much more, so read the other negative reviews.\n\nGood night. And good luck."

        "review_detailed_main": "Interstellar is a movie worth watching only in large format theaters just for the experience. It's loosely based on the Einstein's General Theory of relativity - going into the black-hole travelling with the speed of light and navigating back and forth in time as one of the physical dimensions.\n\nVisually it is interesting to watch the theory of relativity come to reality on screen which is very impressive. It depicts the quantum physics near accurately. The fact that when an object/subject travels with the speed of light, it's original state or age is unaltered/slowed down - is shown convincingly.\n\nApart from the science, the movie strongly revolves around the different Relationships among human beings especially the father daughter one. Matthew McConaughey's acting is very convincing in every scene.\n\nGraphics is something that is worth mentioning here. A new technique that has apparently been used in this movie. Normally the green screens have been used to shot the dramatic/action scenes with actors and the computer graphics were created later and then were super imposed. Even thought this technique is very effective as the computer graphic designers can design the graphics effectively according to the actors movements and the script, the actors should imagine the backgrounds which is quite difficult at times.\n\nBut for this movie shooting, the background graphics were already generated and played in the studio while the actor can feel it and act naturally. The graphics to the viewer may not appeal but in this movie they were apt in the sense that -it's all about the light in the space which may be just white in color or monochromatic theoretically speaking.\n\nNarrative is very good with the age old technique of an old person starting to tell the story and the whole story run as a flashback.\n\nThere have been many movies on the Sci-Fi genre released in the past such as Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future, Steven Spielberg's ET & Close encounters of the third kind, James Cameron's Avatar, Ridley Scott's Alien & Blade Runner, George Lucas's double trilogy Star Wars, and Robert Wise's The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) but Christopher Nolan's Interstellar stands out in many aspects that have not been covered in the previous sci-fi movies that were made over the years.\n\nPersonally, I still think Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey is the best Sci-Fi movie ever made as it has some of the gigantic jump cuts starting from Rock ages to Space ages and concluding in a very convincing theory (Star Child) and the whole movie is a pure experience and allowing the viewer to immerse completely into movie and stop thinking about it. I regret not watching it in a theater especially a large format one. I would say my second favorite Sci-Fi movie is Interstellar."

Christopher Nolan has shaped a movie that tackles some fairly complex astrophysical issues, and carried it off with aplomb.\n\nFantastic special effects, a clever plot and decent performances by an all-star cast.\n\nNot perfect though. The sci fi parts are great but the relationship / human drama stuff seems clumsy at times.\n\nThe scene setting at the beginning seems to take forever. We all know the really good stuff - the space scenes - are coming at some stage but Nolan draws out the more mundane earth stuff.\n\nPlus, there are scenes and plot detours which feel unnecessary, and periods where the movie seems to drift. The Matt Damon sub-plot just felt like padding.\n\nSome of the seemingly unnecessary, overly contrived or implausible things do ultimately have a purpose. The conclusion ties up many loose ends and/or justifies some of the flat moments, but not all."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's really hard to know where to begin with a film like this, with its attached anticipation of greatness. Few critics can be said to have accused the director of making a bad film, most tend to agree that the vast body of his work is very good, and he draws talented cast members and skilled technicians to his projects. This film also has the advantage of being released when the public, at least in the US, is teetering on the brink of renewing its interest in scientific advancement and exploration of the cosmos, thanks in large part to celebrity scientists such as Bill Nye and Neil DeGrasse Tyson. And while the idea of a sci fi exploration film is hardly new, one might argue that this is the first of its type for a generation of films- keeping in mind that certain films such as Gravity at least cross into the same genre to some degree.\n\nWith that in mind, it shouldn't surprise any viewers to find that this territory feels familiar from the start of the film. The rural backdrop contrasted by technology accompanied by an energetic and wistful protagonist, the kids he raises to think freely against the system, a haunted past both in the main character's personal and professional life, mysterious compounds in the middle of nowhere, etc. All these elements are a staple of the explorer's journey, but it is right to say that what is familiar is done right and engages the audience. The film hits its beats right in this regard, and these elements are handled competently.\n\nBut what makes Interstellar stand out is the authenticity of its fictional narrative. There was a great degree of effort put forth to make certain the physics and engineering reflected current knowledge and leading theoretical science, and it shows. There's even talk that the computer models used to give a more accurate picture of a black hole actually advanced astrophysics by leading to discoveries and insights about the warped curvature of space time in such an environment as a singularity produces. Many films can be said to have advanced film making technology, and credit is due there, but few if any can actually be credited with driving the understanding of science. Going into the movie with this idea in mind definitely augmented my experience with the film, and I can only imagine it did so for others.\n\nOne thing I can't help but notice is how well handled the hero narrative is in this film, relying not on creating overly stylized alpha males and sassy spark plugs, but instead having them quietly step up with no fanfare, no glory, and no one liners, doing what is necessary or making the required sacrifices. Our heroes are tormented by mistakes, torn by their emotional conflicts, and vulnerable when it comes to what they love. It's high time this archetype was made more common IMO, and I wait to see if this film has the kind of success which encourages such well defined characteristics in a protagonist. Given the effectiveness of the narrative, it gives one hope.\n\nHaving those aspects combined together with an incredible score, first rate performances, and an intelligent script, Interstellar delivers an amazing cinematic experience. If there were any criticisms I might level at the film, that would be its unmistakable homages to 2001: A Space Odyssey and its somewhat languid pace at times. But these are subjective observations, and should not discourage viewing only for those reasons, which hardly impact the film. I'm giving Interstellar its well deserved 10/10, and recommending it for both imaginative young minds and those adults who never stopped dreaming."

        "review_detailed_main": "Nolan really tries to make you cry with this one. I have never seen him use such powerful emotions in his movies; however that is not necessarily a good thing for this movie, given that he uses his time trying to develop a family relationship at the expense of flow and congruency. Again, the Visuals are completely off the charts. The visual imagery is truly beautiful and something that Nolan has always excelled at. Given that the most visually stunning movie in recent years, Gravity, recently came out, Interstellar does not lag behind and shows you a spectacle of Visual effects.He will most likely win Visual effects at the Oscars. The Hans's score is marvelous and will most likely earn an Oscar nomination. Matthew Mcconaughey's acting is good, but nothing stellar, especially coming off the best acting role of his career. He plays the character like it should be played, but Nolan's characters never being truly drawn out or rounded does not help him any.The same can be said for the rest of the cast. The little girl was marvelous though. I do not want to reveal any piece of the story whatsoever, but i have to say, it is one of the most original scripts i've ever seen.\n\nUltimately this movie is entertaining. There is no way Nolan can miss that. Another great thing that Nolan excels at is INSPIRING. By the time the credits rolled and people walked out, I sat there still in awe at the strong sense of human will the movie conveys. Personally, I don't think this is Nolan's best. I believe Memento stands as his masterpiece. But with Nolan, everyone has their own favorite movie. Maybe for some, Interstellar will be their favorite movie, for it is really Nolan's most ambitious and visually-striking work.\n\nBy the way, Anyone else who even tries to compare Interstellar to \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" is out of their mind. Kubrick's mission was to create art. Nolan in \"Interstellar\" sets to awe and inspire its audiences. It is truly a great piece of work."

He will add lots more awards in future for sure. In this movie he is so emotional, very gutting persona, raw acting performance(which he does so many times) he is so nice to see in big screen so soothing as an actor.... 2)anne, foy, jessica - these actor supports their roles very well. foy as young murph is outstanding. 3)Editing- this films drives in this department mostly. who ever done this job for this film should be appreciated. very slick, clever, not confusing. 4)sounding and background score- if your hear it alone you wont find as Dark knight trilogy. but with the movie it does the job its so witting and very humming like music. 5)captain of the ship: Nolan is a filmmaker the world never forgets. he is overdone himself again. after inception this script will get him in to new height in his career.\n\nbottomline:every penny is worth for watching this movie in theatres. 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "This film tries to treat the topic of interstellar travel seriously. Unfortunately, some ideas are presented according to our current knowledge of physics and astronomy, while others are just stupid. This mixture makes the suspension of disbelief, necessary to enjoy such movie, impossible to attain. On one side we have wormholes, black holes, higher dimensions of space and the silence of the void. On the other hand, there is totally unconvincing reality of the XXI century, where farmers are more valuable than engineers (guys, really?) and tomography is (mysteriously) gone. In one scene the physicist explains convincingly the work regime of the wormhole (by the way, this scene is IDENTICAL to the one from the far better Event Horizon). In another, we see the mission robot TARS, being the member of the crew. I know that humanoid machines from fifties seem ridiculous today (like the one from The Day The Earth Stood Still), but they are really the top quality idea compared to the robots depicted in Interstellar. It is difficult to believe someone created such a model and the whole crew agreed to put it the picture! It's almost like the the wooden planet from the initial script of Alien 3...\n\nThe number of errors and non-logical events is just amazing. Anyone complaining about the lack of consistency in Prometheus (which was also much better than this one) will have the real hunting ground here. In fact, the more time passes after seeing the movie, the more nonsenses are detected. Don't think about this too much, anyway, its not worthy...\n\nThe Nolan brothers used their imagination a little bit too much in the final part of the story, where the word \"magic\" (interchangeable with \"nonsense\") comes to mind. As the result, the viewer is left at the end indifferent to what is presented on the screen and does not care about the fate of the characters... Please recall the infamous Black Hole, and You will have the impression of what is going on here...\n\nThe music is of course the extremely important part of every picture. If the composer knows his craft, the soundtrack complements the images, creating the flawless combo (as was in Terminator, Starship Troopers, Aliens, etc.). Here we have the attempt to create the epic atmosphere, but the events shown on screen are rather uninteresting, therefore the resulting impression is just the overwhelming noise, making the viewer angry instead of touching or moving him."

Christopher Nolan never ceases to amaze me as a director, with all his films so far, I'm hoping he never slips up. There are some nods to 2001 a Space Odyssey, but this really stands on its own. This effects are beyond incredible. And great performances by Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, and Jessica Chastain."

        "review_detailed_main": "Interstellar is itself a crescendo, increasing sensitivity and creativity. I use the term deliberately because it goes crescendo with the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, which is one of the most beautiful music ever scored for a sci-fi movie. We are witnessing a perfect musical arrangement, a total symbiosis, a bit like the music of Gravity which had understood very well how to match the image and the rhythm of a sequence to its own musicality. Zimmer's crescendos are giving a new powerful breath to every new scene, whether it is in visually powerful & intense moments or in more intimate moments; it intrudes into our momentary feelings and sensations, and manages to extend them, sometimes almost to choking, before resting on the balance of the film frame along with our mind spell-bounded.\n\nI have seen all the talent of the director that I knew he was outside the norm, but whom I did not know his capacity to reinvent itself. Because this is it: Interstellar is not an action movie, not really a blockbuster, and it goes not entirely but mostly again the expectations of common people. It's much more than that. This is much more than just a sci-fi movie. It is unlike any of his previous films. Some hoped to see Interstellar as Christopher Nolan's best film, and they were disappointed that this was not the case. And indeed, THIS IS NOT THE BEST FILM of Christopher Nolan. Because in a way, IT IS HIS FIRST FILM. I'm not saying that Interstellar is not as good as his other films, it goes beyond all of them. But to me Interstellar is the first film of a new stage in Nolan's filmography ; it is a masterpiece as it the beginning of a work ahead. Interstellar is the proof that Nolan has finally managed, despite all the expectations that were placed on him after the success of The Dark Knight, to move away from his own reputation to create a personal work, original, humble, sincere and deeply, meticulously, measured."

        "review_title": "The Breakthrough Sci Fi Movie of the Decade",
        "review_detailed_main": "8 November 2014. Interstellar (2014). What stands out in this movie is the role of emotion and how the script introduces a fascinating \"long-distance\" relational component of parent-child interaction unlike those movies with a similar powerful, intense, and emotive impact found in the horror movies of Jennifer Connelly's performance in Dark Water (2005), Radha Mitchell's performance in Silent Hill (2006) or John Cusack's performance in 1408 (2007). Interstellar is today's version of the 1950s sci fi classic Forbidden Planet (1956) in storytelling, big scale, and special effects, perhaps rivaling 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) of the sixties, or the sci fi monster thriller hit of the1970s Alien (1979) in its scale and authenticity or the inspirational, newly presented idea film of the last decade of the super hit Avatar (2009). The interweaving of two story lines in this movie was also a huge editing and script challenge that was well handled and presented on screen. Interstellar is solid story telling with its dramatic but not overly stylish Hollywood gloss and glamour as of say Avatar or Forbidden Planet. Even Ann Hathaway's under-stated surprisingly diminutive performance stands out as a directorial and acting highlight considering Hathaway's bigger than life screen presence and public popularity of the past that enhancing the impact of the movie.\n\nThe overall direction and performances in this movie are introspective and authentic in their approach much like that found in the sci fi drama Stranded (2001) or Apollo 18 (2011) that don't rely on big screen stereotypical theatrics to wow its audiences. Somehow this supposedly epic sci fi adventure is as intimate as Cloud Atlas (2012) was as large spanning literally hundreds of years. Unlike a number of other review references comparing Interstellar to the visual style of sci fi action thriller Inception (2010) or some brief resemblance to Gravity (2013), Interstellar seems to take more from the sci fi relational drama Upside Down (2013) and the sci fi space drama Elysium (2013). As for plot outline, one can argue that Interstellar has more in common with the sci fi mystery of Oblivion (2013) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968 ) especially with noted theoretical leading astrophysicist Kip Thorne as scientific consultant and executive producer. And in contrast, the minimalist music score is in departure to A Space Odyssey's dominating and sometimes haunting musical score. This mind twisting experience includes pieces of the emotion and twisting, off balance characteristics of D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu (2006).\n\nSome might complain about the extended dialogue, there really is a more satisfying exchange of relevant thoughtful ideas during this movie that are interspersed among amazing special effects that are leading edge for our literal time and space. When it comes to cerebral and emotive impact, Interstellar does so in a more narrative, mystery drama fashion as Ender's Game (2013) hit the similar points using a war action, adventure motif. The sci fi television mini-series The Triangle (2005) brought many of the intriguing and suspense aspects in a lower budgeted, popular mass audience approach, but also indicating how Interstellar was presented in a quality, big budget, high definition big screen format with a corresponding mesmerizing impact. What makes Interstellar so markedly ground breaking is director's Christopher Nolan's leap with this movie in its freshness and significantly different visual presentation, its tight editing and retention of the human relational importance while also presenting to dual track story outline in seamless and meaningful power way. Interstellar recalls the similar breathing mind-bending experiences in Brainstorm (1983) with Natalie Wood and Christopher Walken. Contact (1997) with Jodie Foster and also co-starring Matthew McConaughey, the children's version of A Wrinkle In Time (2002), the otherworldly time altering classic of Slaughter-House Five (1972), the haunting alien ambiance of Solaris (2002)."

The other characters are undeveloped and exist to represent specific ideas.\n\nScript/Writing - 0/2 - The script is a hodgepodge of corny tag lines and poorly executed themes.\n\nVisuals - 2/2 - The fate of humanity apparently rests on the colonization of bleak planets in bleak space, but at least there are cool wormholes, black holes, and baseball fields.\n\nConcept (Plot/Theme) - 1/2 - Interstellar deserves at least one point for ambition and creativity, but too many questionable plot developments are thrown together, and the film does not seem to commit to any of its ideas or themes, though some, such as time dilation, are certainly fascinating. When not confounded by possible paradoxes or superficial musings on love, one is left to question the viability of an anti-intellectual society portrayed with such unexplained cynicism, as well as the human imperative to survive on other planets when the species is apparently inclined to destroy its own natural habitat.\n\nTotal Score - 5/10\n\nGut Feeling - 6/10 - For a film espousing the virtues of love and exploration, Interstellar has little emotional resonance. Plotwise, it's a memorable mess.\n\nFinal Average - 5.5/10"

Because Interstellar never competes against any other film: stands alone by itself and take the most complex issues of quantum physics and flows during the movie like astronauts in space, with terrific performances, remembering that we are human beings attached to others, and first of all, we are explorers, we evolve and what we see is more wonderful than what we think we know. An absolute, magical and wonderful artwork. I recommended this movie a thousand times."

It ruins the mystery, and the opportunity for me to use my own imagination. Unfortunately the time spent making sure that everyone in the audience understands the movie EXACTLY the way the director wants you to, is spent, at the expense of a good storyline and the development of believable characters and meaningful relationships. A funny idea, and a powerful soundtrack, just doesn't cut it for me. I was very underwhelmed and disappointed, but go see for yourself."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hands down. This is a masterpiece. I feel like Nolan achieved a modern 2001 - without being too much 2001, despite having some similarities. Saw it last night with a bunch of people in a German cinema on a big screen (non IMAX) and a very good sound system. This is a film made for the big screen and you really feel it, especially in the space sequences.\n\nThis movie is visually astounding, with some visuals even being relevant for science, as they rendered the most scientific accurate black hole to date. The actors all did a fantastic job and you really feel they had a lot of fun acting in actual sets. Yes, the set design is brilliant. Especially the \"real\" spacecraft set.\n\nChristopher Nolan once again takes scientific theories, this time supported by the famous expert physicist Kip Thorne, explains them in his film's logic and plays with them in a creative way. We know this from Inception but this time his script includes more heart, more emotions. The plot is constantly thrilling and exciting, with some scenes taking my breath away. And of course there are typical Nolan twists one might not see coming before. The score by Hans Zimmer once again makes the great scenes even better. He just knows how to increase the tension of a scene with his sound. And when the cinema shakes and hums and pushes you in your seat, you know the sound design is perfect.\n\nThis film really caught me personally. My heart was beating in the action sequences, I was blown away by the visuals, I unconsciously held my breath in the first scene in space, the climax really was rewarding and very creative. I enjoyed it a lot.\n\nI seriously don't understand why so many critics and audience had so many issues with it whereas many more international critics and communities say it is a masterpiece. The big gap between RT critics score and IMDb's worldwide audience score speaks for itself.\n\nFor me, this is one of the best Sci-fi films of our time. 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "children I shall be talking about Interstellar. But before I do, I think I better give you a little context, just to show how high my expectations were for this film. I love Christopher Nolan. I am a Nolanite, or Nolanoid, or whatever people who like Christopher Nolan are called. I've pretty much loved every film he's ever done. It confuses me when people slag him off because he's clearly the best writer/director to be working on mainstream blockbuster films since Steven Spielberg, only I think that his films are much better than Steven's.\n\nHis films are only so thrilling because of the intimacy he creates between the audience and the characters. As soon as I heard Christopher Nolan's next film was a sci-fi film called, Interstellar, I was excited. I was so excited that I only treated myself to one viewing of the teaser trailer and first trailer. It was enough, I was sold and I didn't want to see any other trailer, because I wanted to know and see as little as possible.\n\nI decided that Interstellar needed to be seen in IMAX, so I booked my ticket to see Interstellar on the biggest screen in the UK. Even though the film had garnered some mixed reviews (I was hoping for full-on rave ones, like when The Dark Knight and Inception came out) I still put my trust into Christopher to deliver me something extraordinary. I don't know if it's the gigantic screen talking, but Interstellar absolutely delivered.\n\nThis was the best experience I've ever had at the cinema. The huge screen and ear-popping sound made the experience incredibly intense and by the end of it, I felt like I had been for a little trip out in space. I'm not sure if this will translate quite so well on your TV screen at home, however the film is unmissable whatever you choose to see it on. Whilst a lot of the film does rely on extraordinary visuals and heart-stopping set-pieces, at its heart it's an intimate family drama which suggests that your children are your one and only important universe.\n\nI was absolutely sucked into the film from the moment it started. The stuff before Matthew goes into space is probably some of the best stuff in the film. We learn so much about Coop and he becomes a worthy character to invest three hours into (three hours which fly by, I might add). There's a strong focus on the relationship between Coop and his daughter, and it's this relationship which drives the film right up to, and including, its jaw-dropping conclusion. The first hour is also quite funny too, which was a nice surprise as Nolan doesn't normally dabble in too much humour.\n\nThere's a really emotional scene where Coop wants to say goodbye to his daughter, who he doesn't know when he's going to see again, before his space travels. It's beautifully acted by both Matthew McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy and is at the powerful centre of the whole film. After this the film adopts an entirely new setting. Literally. We're blasted off into space and the fun really begins. The less you know about the space scenes, the better, as it's a lot of fun to try and work out just where the film is going! Suffice to say that Interstellar is jam-packed with eye-popping visuals and intense thrills which dwarf last year's Gravity into a speck of space dust by comparison.\n\nWith The Dark Knight Rises, Christopher proved that he could direct on a big scale and Interstellar is his biggest yet. He has an ambition which most directors lack and instead of kicking him down for it, we should be nurturing it! Interstellar presents us with new and exciting ideas which colossally blow other mainstream films out of the water. The action is also elevated to unreachable new heights thanks to Hans Zimmer's astonishing score. It's a haunting piece of music that will be ringing in your head for hours after the film has finished. He's left the big drums and strings behind and re-invented himself with a bizarre church organ which perfectly matches the dark atmosphere of the film.\n\nA lot of people have expressed a strong disliking to the final 40 minutes of Interstellar. I can see why as up until then the film is more or less possible to understand. It's complex, but it's still easy enough to follow. However, Christopher completely rips up the rule book and Interstellar goes seriously barmy in the last 40 minutes. Personally, I loved the third act and it just goes to show the sheer creativity and ambition which Christopher Nolan has going inside his head. I found it all very interesting both on a visual and intellectual level. I don't understand it all, but I have my theories and I'm sure that there will be a mountain of theories cropping up on the interweb.\n\nInterstellar is a truly remarkable experience. It boasts awesome ideas and visuals, but it never forgets its heart. I'm a tough cookie to make cry, but I'm not going to lie (ooh poetry!) there were three occasions when I had tears filling up in my eyes. There are some astonishingly powerful and moving scenes in there which reminds me why I go to the cinema. I don't just want crazy visuals and excitement, I want to be moved and I want to be invested in characters so that I care what happens to them at the end. Interstellar more than achieves that.\n\nI'll need to give it another watch to work out where I'd put it on Christopher Nolan's mesmerising filmography, but he hasn't let me down. I hope that Interstellar is seen as a sci-fi classic in years to come because it really does deserve that accolade.\n\nRead more weird, dazzling and uncut reviews at www.asdaman.wordpress.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "I will not lie. If you had one year ago asked me ,personally, what is the most anticipated movie of 2014, the answer would be this film. About this film we did not know much, which says a lot about trailers that are now recorded as they have revealed almost the entire movie.\n\nIn short, our planet Earth is dying and we can save it only through special mission that travels far into space. What is interesting is that the film is based on the theory of relativity and black holes and on film worked physicist Kip Thorne as a producer which gives a weight. The film lasts 169 minutes, which is practically three hours, but not a single minute was not boring. With this film Nolan did what Kubrick done with 2001 Odyssey 1968, he was ahead of his time. I know some will say that the problem is a big difference in technology and budget, but I find it incomparably. Clearly, there are numerous references to Odyssey during the movie and I was pleased when I saw the link, however, Nolan brings something new, something of his own and therefore I consider him a genius. Visually, the film is perfect. When watching it, then you do not see the CGI effects, you actually viewing space! Of course, in this film there is a turnover that perhaps many will not like but I am absolutely thrilled with a twist and the end of the film. It's very ambitious, I admit, it causes you to think and use our gray cells, but is it not that the goal of the film (or should be)? Why do we like movies? Why do we go to the cinemas? I am absolutely delighted with all aspects of the film, starting with the lead actor, story, visual effects, music, plot and ending. I'm not even a little bit disappointed despite great anticipation and so pure a ten from me."

She remembered more of it than I did (odd, because my memories of movies is usually much better) and as we talked about it more and got to recalling the ending I said, \"This is *that* movie? That was terrible!\"\n\nI think I was so annoyed at the ending I'd blanked out having seen the movie at all.\n\nSecond time through, I feel the same way about the ending. Terrible. \"Deus ex machina\". Ticked me off as much as the ending of \"Arrival\" did. And it's really a shame, because the rest of the movie was pretty well done. Nice world building, stunning visuals (if at times a bit too 2001- ish), pretty good acting, plot, pacing. I'd love to want to watch this again for all that. But I will never do that, I would not want to experience the ending again."

The art of story telling with camera has certainly been personified to its zenith by Mr. Nolan. Keeping Physics as the pivotal ingredient. Movies like Interstellar needs to be watched time and again. Over the years, generation after generation. There are certain questions which would certainly come to one's mind after coming out of the theatre. As the question's answer can be understood only after repeated views.No matter how much one pays to watch this movie or no matter how much one apreciates, it will always be to little for such a massive human creation."

So in other words I didn't really have any expectations for this title to begin with.\n\nThis is one of those movies I will only be watching once. There were three things that stood out to me that drew my attention, first; the poster looks pretty cool, second; it stars Matthew McConaughey, and third; it's directed by Christopher Nolan. Those are three really good reasons to watch this, right? Wrong. This movie makes 2001; A Space Odyssey look like Bad Boys II. If you have daddy problems and are looking for an intergalactic soap opera in the form of a movie, this might be what you are looking for.\n\nI hate to hate but I feel like my time has been wasted watching this. The characters aren't very likable, the plot isn't very compelling, in fact it got rather stale near the end. Don't expect Prometheus. Don't expect Star Wars or Star Trek. Expect something that more or less belongs on the Lifetime channel."

You imagine what you get if you have great acting and poor directing, or great directing and poor story, or great story and poor focus.\n\nWhat do we have in this movie? Great acting, great directing, great poetry, and absurd scientific claims, which kills the joy of watching the movie if you are a little aware of the principles of modern physics.\n\nIf you are an artist or musician, or anyone who has no knowledge about quantum mechanics, relativity, and modern cosmology, you can go and watch this movie and enjoy its great poetry. If you, however, have some knowledge I warn you that you may feel distrust and disappointment to the whole story and start blaming all the actors and the director for making such serious efforts while the story is scientifically absurd.\n\nI mean if the director (and the rest) intend to create a sci-fi movie they must avoid too detailed and serious explanations of how things happens in the universe (with serious faces). This reflects their ignorance and spoils the poetry of the movie.\n\nI can bring few facts from the movie that is nonsense and they needed to avoid it.\n\n1. A warm hole is a theoretical concept, and in practice no one even remotely knows what it is yet. 2. You may travel through a warm hole, but you cant direct yourself to a particular planet. 3. A black hole has several orders of magnitude more gravity and warmth than the sun, anything falling into it burns down and becomes about the size of an atom. The protagonist would be dead long before reaching its center. 4. And all this nonsense of looking to our particular earth from the black hole just because it has different dimensionality ... I don't even want to talk about it. 5. After 30 years their children needed to think about other life related things as well, and not sitting and talking about their father's mission all the time (be a bit realistic about life). 6. The biggest nonsense - after years father and daughter are meeting and just smiling and crying. This is not an American drama folks, the man has been in another galaxy and see the most unnatural thing in life: his daughter is 80 years old. They both should have been perplexed, got panic attack, feel extreme feelings, collapse or something. What the hell was that? A meeting with tears and smile?\n\nTo sum up: The immensity of the universe and its effect on human aspect is is poorly explored. There should have been abnormal feelings going on in the move due to this, but we saw none!"

        "review_detailed_main": "'Interstellar' was a film I'd been waiting to see all year, and it certainly is a huge sci-fi film - $165 million budget - from one of the best filmmakers going round. Basically, we spend 40min on Earth in the not-too-distant-future, where all the crops are failing and Homo sapiens are about to be wiped from the planet. Cooper (McConaughey), Romilly (Gyasi) & Dr Brand (Hathaway) are then sent to another galaxy - via a wormhole - as a last grasp attempt to find another habitable planet.\n\nThe film does really well of asking those big picture themes - what's more important, family of the entire species, love or exploration, why do we matter? However, as a sci-fi/action film, it sometimes lets itself down - the characters aren't that well developed, beside Cooper & his two kids (Chastain & Affleck when they're older) and there's too much maths/physics/relativity and not enough excitement and wonder.\n\nSure, the special effects you do get to see of the black hole and the planets they visit are great, but there's just not enough of them - it's a lot of them in a space suit/ship with an overbearing Hans Zimmer's score making it hard to hear actual dialogue. It's probably slightly longer than necessary also - 2 hours 50min, with the last 30min being a less-than-ideal conclusion to the film. Hopefully Damon playing an astronaut prepares him for next year's 'The Martian', which should be more exciting than 'Interstellar'.\n\nNolan - who will arguably one day go down as a directorial legend like Kubrick - owes a lot to '2001: A Space Odyssey' and essentially 'Interstellar' doesn't do anything better than that film 46 years ago. But it's not all bad - I think my expectations were too high, especially after 'Gravity' last year - with Caine & Lithgow being solid on Earth and the robots, TARS & CASE (very similar voices/roles to HAL in '2001' & GERTY in 'Moon') providing some humour (and a very unique form/function!)."

Hum, sorry, I was saying that the sound department was run by either a deaf or retarded person. And so is Mr Nolan, who possibly didn't bother checking his final product. The thing that passes for music is that loud. Reading lips sometimes help, but half the talking is through radio anyway, so good luck with that.\n\nThat's when I realise that Nolan can't actually tell a story through pictures. In many scenes, what is shown is severely shifted from what should be seen, and I would really need the dialogue to explain what is happening, but I can't decipher it because, you know, idiots at the helm. In the same vein, there are quite a lot of inconsistencies and silly concepts. And maybe the writer did come up with acceptable vocal explanations, but I'll never know, because a monkey spilled the background soundtrack all over the track I wanted to hear, and nobody cleaned it up.\n\nDuring the projection, I was seriously and increasingly getting angry at the technical lousiness. That's a first. Hollowood has reached new levels of incompetence.\n\nSave your time and money for something made by caring professionals."

An absolute master in his craft.\n\nVisually it's also relatively stunning and has some intriguing concepts. Besides this though, I just didn't buy it, it was too unbelievable and all I heard before watching was how it was supposed to be accurate, or as accurate as is perceptible. I appreciate this was a big movie with the aim of appealing to a large audience, but how some of the script has to explain to the audience what is going on was just a massive fail for me and completely took away my immersion.\n\nI wanted to like this movie so much, I've tried watching it multiple times, I just don't. It has all the right ingredients for a sumptuous cake but it's like they forgot to put the filling in and it's just sponge, nice sponge, but not a sponge you would later tell your friends about, or post on social media (if that's your thing).\n\nI could point out specifics but they would be spoilers and I try to maintain spoiler free reviews. If you are interested in watching I would still very much say yes go for it, there's every chance you may think my review is unfair. I am definitely right about the soundtrack though, that is exceptional."
