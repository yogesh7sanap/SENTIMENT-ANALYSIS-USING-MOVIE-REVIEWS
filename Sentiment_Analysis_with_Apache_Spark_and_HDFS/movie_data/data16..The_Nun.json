        "review_detailed_main": "It seems like, in The Conjuring 2, the writers just thought: \"a monster in a nun costume - that seems really cool!\" Then, when they try to build a story around it, they can't get the square peg to fit in the round hole. It's a nun monastery in Romania. And a demon called Valak. But why is he running around in a nun costume? That story doesn't get developed enough. A good ghost story always have a mystique and history, but this movie doesn't deliver in that aspect. Instead they seem just to rely on jump scares and cheap thrills."

        "review_title": "Not what you want it to be",
        "review_detailed_main": "Let's begin with saying that the movie is definitely still worth the time to see. As there are a few moments where The Nun is portrayed in such a way that you do feel how great and powerful it is, and the music during these scenes (trust me, you will recognise them when you see them) is incredible. You'll feel hopeless, just as the characters at that time, but unfortunately these moments are scarce.\n\nAs human being, we find darkness scary, we hate it because we cannot see properly and thus find ourselves in the unknown. This is what drives a good horror movie, it is why the first Paranormal Activity was such a success for example. The horror of things happening, but not knowing what it is or where it is. The Nun fails to deliver this horror of the unknown. As we, in almost all scenes, see what it is that should terrify us, in great and gory detail. And while I love a tip of the hat to a more old school type of horror (more gore and monstrous feelings), I do not like how The Nun delivers it.\n\nThe amount of times we see a close up of the face of the nun is insane, and takes away the fear that this character had left us in during the Conjuring movies. It was the lack of screentime and the darkness surrounding this character that made her so extremely scary and interesting in those movies. It reminded me of the Devil's face in the original Exorcist movie. We don't see it often, but when we see it it terrifies us, because we cannot quite tell all the characteristics of its face, and it is always surrounded by darkness. The Nun is blatantly obvious, and her screaming in the camera makes it feel more like you're watching The Mummy, than The Nun.\n\nThen there's the writing, the addition of comic relief is a good idea, but the timing is always off and rarely funny. The storyline is a bit basic, a gateway to hell, again, a demon needs a body, again, our past haunts us, again; it delivers nothing we haven't seen already. And I don't mind that, but then at least deliver it with tenacity. The jump scares feel as though they know that the audience knows its coming, so they just try to come at you from a different position than you expect: e.g., camera does a full 360, we expect something to happen, it doesn't and then something drops from above.\n\nNo, the movie disappoints. The story is basic, the timing of humor is laughable and the excessive amount of screentime - for that which petrified us with hardly any in the Conjuring movies - makes the Nun into something we hoped it wouldn't be. And unfortunately the great scenery, actually horrifying scenes and amazing soundtrack just can't lift this movie beyond 'just another horror movie'."

Writing this to get to the required 600. How long did it take a committee to come up with that random number? Okay I need four more, there that did it."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is OBVIOUSLY missing the James Wan touch that we loved in the conjuring universe films. Even when Wan used jump scares , it worked bc the atmosphere was tense and creepy . In \"The Nun\" they're overly planted everywhere in the movie to make up for the fact that the director couldn't keep the audience captivated any other way.\n\nThe plot is basic to say the least, it's almost like they just threw it together in 5 minutes to make up a back story for The Nun. The film had so much potential to give the audience a interesting creepy back story to one of the conjuring's iconic villains. Instead we're saturated with filler for the 1st and 2nd act , and FINALLY get something going on the final act . Up until then it's nothing but jump scare city . So if that's up your alley for horror movies then you'll love this . I personally think the brief amount of time The Nun was in the Conjuring 2 was 100000x better than this full length film.\n\nThey also tried to go with this new trend of adding some comedy into a horror film and it's just badly placed and awkward . The acting is okay . Taissa Farmiga & Demien Bichir are the main characters and give pretty good performances.\n\nAnyway, Overall this movie could've gone straight to DVD or Netflix . Don't think it deserved to hit the big screen if it wasn't going to be directed by Wan . There's some creepy/scary enjoyable moments but overall it's very cliche and downright boring at times. Watch when you're at home on a rainy day with nothing do. Don't waste ur money like i did"

The film was shot wonderfully, locations were beautiful, color was perfect, and FX were spot on. That being said... for a demonic style horror film, I really prefer a little more background. With films out like Hereditary that are based in real, historically accurate lore, the bar has been set higher in that genre. The Nun's plot seemed rather thrown together to me.\n\nOn the plus side... Taissa Farmiga is an amazing actor and was brilliant. I almost give her full credit for me liking the film as much as I did. I really believe she is a staple to the horror genre. Bonnie Aarons is amazing as the Nun as well. I do wish they would use a little prosthetics on her to keep the nun from looking so much like her. After her role in these films I don't know if i'll ever be able to see her as anything but an evil, demonic nun. Overall... I give 6 out of 10."

They team-up with Frenchie and soon Frenchie and Burke are is attacked by a demon. Irene learns that Burke is tormented for killing a boy in an exorcism. On the next morning, Irene is accepted in the abbey and learns that there is a gate to hell in the catacombs. Meanwhile Burke finds that a demon called Valak has unleashed through a breach. Now they have to seal the breach with the blood of Christ to trap Valak inside the gate.\n\n\"The Nun\" is an underrated horror movie with fake one or two line \"reviews\" that IMDb has accepted this year, giving credibility zero to this site that was a reference in the past together with Rotten Tomatoes. The cinematography is magnificent, the atmosphere is spooky and the cast has good performances. Unfortunately the plot has a big flaw, since the powerful Valak has many chances to possess Irene as a vessel to leave the abbey but lures her many times instead. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"A Freira\" (\"The Nun\")"

        "review_detailed_main": "If you had told me five years ago that one of my most anticipated movies of 2018 would be titled 'The Nun' I would've been very surprised. It was though. I had been looking forward to this movie ever since it was announced. I'm a huge fan of both of 'The Conjuring' movies, but have admittedly not loved either of the two 'Annabelle' spin-offs. I was very pleased to see James Wan was attached to the writing side of things on this one though and so held out high hopes for it. Sadly though, I have to report this is another complete misfire.\n\nStarting with the positives though - the movie looks great. The set decoration is truly terrific in nearly every scene and the building and surrounding area that the film is set in were ideally selected. The groundwork was there for this to be a very creepy movie. At times the movie does work too, but that is mainly when it is being subtle. There are a lot of scenes where images of 'The Nun' are sort of there, but also sort of not. You question yourself whether you are actually seeing what you think you are. I really liked that side of things. Too often though the film is far too in your face. The demon will jump out of a tree and scream into a character's face (a very lion-like and un-scary scream I would have to say as well).\n\nThe dialogue in this film is a real mess too, which surprised me considering Wan's involvement. The character of 'Frenchie' is particularly painful. He is meant to be the comic relief, but nothing he says is in any way funny, and is frankly a little embarrassing in parts. Also some of the things the demon says like, \"The village will be missing its idiot tomorrow\" (or something to that effect), are cringe-worthy and should never have made the final cut.\n\nI was very let down by this film. There are a lot of jump-scares, and not one of them gave me the slightest jolt. My heart-rate never rose above resting in any scene and I was frankly bored for the most part. The only saving graces were that the film looked great, connected in with the rest of the series well and had a truly great final scene that left me a little blown away. I didn't want this to have to be a negative review, but there was no other way to go about it."

For one, although the movie makes much of this being in Romania, and indeed it was filmed there, hardly anyone seems to actually be Romanian. What's really a bothersome anomaly, though, is that the convent and the people involved are Roman Catholic. Certainly there is Roman Catholicism in Romania, but generally only amongst ethnic minorities, especially Hungarians. Actual ethnic Romanians with any religious affiliation, however, almost always identify as Romanian Orthodox, and that is a very important distinction that any Romanian will immediately notice. People elsewhere may think that's no big deal, but just imagine you have a movie set in Italy and every one there is an Episcopalian. Don't you think those in the know would find that ridiculous?"

Well produced by James Wan and Peter Safran (producers of all the films in the franchise); it's a terrifying Ghost story that finds an evil nun seeking vendetta and carrying out a criminal spree. This scary movie produced by the successful James Wan who presents another creepy horror tale with a Nun as starring. 1952, when a young nun at a cloistered abbey in Romania takes her own life, the Vatican assigns a peculiar duo to investigate it. A priest with a haunted past, Father Burke (as Demian Bichir) and a young nun (Taissa Farmiga) on the threshold of her final vows are sent by the Vatican to investigate the death of a young nun in Romania and confront a malevolent force in the form of a demonic nun. Together they uncover the order's unholy secret. Risking not only their lives but their faith and their very souls, they confront a malevolent force in the form of the same demonic nun that first terrorized audiences in 'The Conjuring 2,' as the abbey becomes a horrific battleground between the living and the damned. The greatest evil in The Conjuring Universe !. Confess your sins !. Witness the Darkest Chapter in The Conjuring Universe !. Pray For Forgiveness !. She Doesn't Forgive !. Witness the Darkest Chapter in The Conjuring Universe !.\n\nTerror film that shows the chilling origins of the possessed nun Valak, who became known in 'Warren file: Enfield case'. Prequel/Spin of the Warren File franchise, stars Demi\u00e1n Bichir and Taissa Farmiga, also makes a brief appearance in the epilogue of the Patrick Wilson film and Vera Farmiga, portraying their characters from the original series. It displays relentless chiller , intrigue , shocks, hard-edged drama , plot twists , creepy images and some gore when crimes takes place. This hit 'The Nun' in which the scream queen Tessa Farmiga puts on the habit to kill the chilling demon Valak, she plays a novitiate on the threshold of her final vows sent by the Vatican to investigate. Here Taissa Farmiga and Demian Bichir confront the very thing that haunts their dreams and forever links them together in hushed silence. They battle a malevolent force in the form of the same demonic nun (Bonnie Aaarons) that first terrorized audiences in 'The Conjuring 2,' as the convent becomes a horrific battleground between the living and the damned.\n\nThis frightening movie is plenty of thrills , screams , gore, eerie scenes, high body-count and lurid images with lots of eerie scenes, blood and gore. This worldwide smash hit follows Sister Irene who comes face-to-face with Valak, the demon nun. It is an usual horror movie where the intrigue , tension , suspense appear threatening and lurking in every room , corridors , church and convent, including some chilling frames. The main protagonists are Demian Bichir, Tessa Farmiga (Nun I, Mula, The twilight Zone) giving good performances as the priest with dark past and the brave nun who helps him. And Bonnie Aarons and Jonas Bloquet installment as Valak and Frenchie respectively. Special effects are pretty well but there are several scenes without much sense and the main and secondary interpretations are acceptable. Interesting premise about a heinous nun is partially wasted but it has its moments here and there.\n\nIt containg a tense and suspenseful musical score by Abel Korzeniowski , an expert on terror movies and dark atmosphere. As well as a somber and gloomy cinematography by cameraman Maxime Alexandre. Shooting took place at the Corvin Castle in Hunedoara, and in Sighisoara, Transylvania, Romania, and also at Mogosoaia Palace, near Bucharest, Romania. This spooky movie was efficiently directed Corin Hardy (The Hallow, Gangs of London) in her second feature film.\n\nFollowed by \u00a8The Nun II\u00a8by Michael Chaves, set in 1956 in Tarancon (France) four years after the demonic events of 1952, Father Noiret burns to death in the air. Valek's demon has died and Sister Irene, who now serves in a convent in Italy, must once again face this evil to return him to hell. Stars Irene (Tessa Farmiga), Debra (Storm Reid), the teacher Kate (Anna Popplewell); on the other hand, repeat in this second entry Frenchie (Jonas Bloquet) and The Nun (Bonnie Aarons) . While Valak often tormenting students with her own brand of extreme religious zealotry, this nightmarish nun was deathly strict with her code of ethics.\n\nJames Wan goes to production this time and is also co-author of the story on which the script is based together with the screenwriter Gary Dauberman: Annabelle Comes Home, Anabelle: creation. The saga Warren marriage : Patrick Wilson/Vera Farmiga is formed as follows : The Conjuring (2013) by James Wan , The Conjuring 2 (2016) by James Wan and The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It (2021) by Michael Chaves . Rating : 6/10 . Acceptable and passable film that will appeal to horror lovers."

The jumpscare plagued, unexplained and way too over the top plot is such a waste due to the fact that technically, this movie is the best in the conjuring universe.\n\nThe cgi, production design, cinematography and the haunting soundtrack are all very very decent. However none of this can make up for the nonsensical satanic mess that this movie turned out to be. Virtually completely non frightening, the Nun itself as a presence loses its ominousness very early into the second act. It is always shown in the same way as in the trailer. A creepy choir and a floating nun. It gets very boring after a while, and even when the atmosphere starts to seem somewhat decent, you get taken out of it even more when the misplaced and useless comic relief character opens his mouth.\n\nThe acting is mostly passable but the actors aren't given much to work with in the first place. Most of this film is just a continuous barrage of \"scary\", meaningless scenes that add up to nothing but cheap jumpscsres.\n\nAs a part of the conjuring universe it does NOT IN ANY WAY explain the origins of the Nun. The only thing it does for the universe is set up a sequel and another possible prequel.\n\n4.3/10"

Well, sadly The Nun was nothing like what I expected. It was a total letdown. The plot was weak, they relied too heavily on predictable jump scares, too much CGI, and just like other people have said, I couldn't wait for the movie to be over because of how bad it was.

        "review_detailed_main": "Have an appreciation for horror, remember really liking 'The Conjuring' films (though they need a re-watch) and liked the idea. The advertising also suggested a quite creepy film if done right. Seeing that 'The Nun' was not positively received, critically and by word of mouth, however lowered my expectations somewhat, being one of not many to have respect for critics opinions.\n\nSeeing 'The Nun' with an open mind, with the intent of actually liking the film and going against the grain (as has actually been the case quite a number of times, though often do agree with general consensus), for me it was not as bad as many have said and it is not one of the worst of the year. It's not even among the worst of the horror genre. It was though a disappointment and managed to be worse than my lowered expectations, far from being one of the best of the year as well.\n\n'The Nun' at least didn't insult my intelligence (on the most part), it is not that amateurish and didn't get the sense it was completely not trying, while thinking that it could have tried harder. From personal opinion, 'The Nun' does have similar problems as 'Slender Man', except it's a better film.\n\nFound 'The Nun' to be a good-looking film, very spooky in setting and atmospheric in lighting. It's slickly photographed too and the effects not cheap. The music does have an unsettling ambience and doesn't sound cheap in how it's recorded or orchestrated.\n\nIt started off very well, the beginning was unnerving and did have dread and tension.\n\nHowever, 'The Nun' did go downhill quickly too early and struggles to recover. One is told too much and far too soon, which completely diminishes the suspense and makes things very predictable. The direction is both leaden and disorganised and while the actors try gamely they have nothing to work with, with clunky dialogue galore and poorly developed clich\u00e9s passing for characters that are both bland and annoying.\n\nDialogue throughout has no natural flow and reeks of cheese. The story is very poorly paced, mainly dull, and the back-story is far too ridiculous, clich\u00e9d and with bland atmosphere and nothing new to engage with it or take it at face value. It is not fun, with comic relief that is not funny, sometimes not tasteful and features too much. 'The Nun', like 'Slender Man', feels like a short film over-stretched to breaking point for a feature film, the content is just too little and the titular character is far too underused and is more so what than scary when revealed. 'The Nun' also fails at being scary or interesting, the too thin story and deadly dull pacing kills the tension, suspense and dread, making the atmosphere bland throughout, while there is too much of an over-reliance on jump-scares that are too random, senseless and obvious to be creepy.\n\nOn the whole, not terrible but disappoints. 4/10 Bethany Cox"

We went with some friends, after ignoring all the negative and bad reviews over the web. We even heard some of our friends who had already seen the movie, bashing it with negatives, but we decided to go anyway.\n\nI am not a sucker for horror movies, let's just sort that one out, but I loved the previous two Conjuring movies, and had also seen Annabelle. I didn't like Annabelle as much as I did like The Nun. It was something new, a new touch to the story, and although it wasn't directed by James Wan, it was still good!\n\nYes, it has a lot of jump scares, sometimes predictable, sometimes not, but it's still fun. The rush you feel when the chair you're sitting in starts jerking chaotically and the characters in front of you scream in fear, that's what I was looking for. After all you go to a movie to have fun, not to judge and analyze every bit of it. What would it become of a movie, if everything would be perfect and carefully thought through. I enjoyed the story, even if it felt a bit rushed in the beginning. The eerie feeling the movie gives you, represents a big plus as well. You feel isolated and alone throughout the whole experience, and it makes you feel better when other characters join the action, and the band gets back together. I mean, a priest, a nun who hasn't pledged herself to becoming a full nun and a farmer, well. How bad could this trio be? Let me tell you, they fit perfectly. Although the Nun herself, or let's say Valak, didn't have much screen time, except toward the end, you still felt her/his presence throughout the movie.\n\nOverall a fun and enjoyable ride. A few clich\u00e9 moments, but still good toward the end. Great effects and a total blast seen at 4DX 2D.\n\nSo, if you enjoy horror movies, and you're not one of those fellas who goes to the movie with a pencil and a notebook in his hand, in order to analyze and criticize everything he sees, you're good to go. You'll have fun."

        "review_detailed_main": "Medieval theologians used to say that monasteries and abbeys were inundated with demons while the marketplace may have had only one or two; more were required to corrupt the incorruptible cloistered folks while the buyers and sellers in the marketplace were far easier targets. Of course, this speaks more of a distrust of economic activity, and a veneration of the religious life. With \"The Nun\" however, we have an abbey of nuns, in Romania no less, that has definitely been corrupted by evil. I'm not familiar with the \"Conjuring Universe\" franchise, nor am I a frequent viewer of horror films like some reviewers on this site, but \"The Nun\" was reasonably well done, had the appropriately gloomy sets, and had a pervasively ominous atmosphere. True, there were logic pitfalls in the plot, and the \"Frenchie\" character was somewhat anomalous, but I enjoyed this movie.\n\nAdmittedly, cliches abound in this film. We have somber music, a darkly-lit abbey, fleeting, indistinct images (to heighten our imagination), superstitious, frightened townspeople (not unlike the usual peasants), an abbey that totally locks up at night and stays that way until sunrise, Latin incantations, and the usual revelation at the end that maybe the evil is not completely vanquished after all. We find these cliches often in horror filmmaking because, let's face it, they work (again and again) for most of us. One cliche I wouldn't mind being altered is the \"character,\" both physical and spiritual, of the evil demon(s). Instead of physically repulsive creatures possessed of violent fury, why not have an evil being who is coldly austere, strictly self-contained, totally amoral, and cunningly manipulative. Now he / she would be dangerous in a different way, not unlike Satan and his temptations."

While it boasts some chilling moments and atmospheric settings, it falls short in certain areas. Here's a 7/10 review:\n\n\"The Nun\" presents a visually striking Gothic backdrop that sets the stage for some genuinely hair-raising moments. The eerie atmosphere and effective jump scares contribute to a decent horror experience. However, the plot feels somewhat convoluted at times, and character development could have been stronger. The titular character, Valak, portrayed by Bonnie Aarons, is undeniably creepy and captivating, but the story around her leaves some unanswered questions.\n\nDespite its flaws, \"The Nun\" manages to deliver a fair share of scares, and fans of the horror genre may find it enjoyable, especially if they are already invested in \"The Conjuring\" universe. It may not reach the heights of some of its predecessors, but it still offers a spooky night at the movies for those seeking a good scare."

I honestly didn't go in with high hopes as these paranormal/ghost/possession type horrors don't usually interest me as I find them boring for the most part, I'm sure there are good ones out there but more often than not their very samey imo. Obviously the original Exorcist was a masterpiece but that goes without saying. Anyhoo I digress.... The Nun lived up to my worst fears and doesn't give me much hope for this franchise. However I hope to be proved wrong and shall preserve, lord knows I've done it enough times for my beloved slasher franchises and wow that's not always been easy."

Because of the atmosphere and mood there is great suspense for the first few scares, but with too much repetition of jump scares, the tension starts to dissipate...\n\nBad: This film is a jump-scare fest. The writing lacks substance and ends up being a poor origin story with: a rushed introduction that comes off as choppy, a messy middle with little plot consisting of jump scares that become exhausting and predictable because of its abundance, and a bizarre and over the top ending. The characters are wooden and over the course of the movie do not show much dynamic. Throughout the movie, there is cheesy comedy and forced romance.\n\nOverall: Bring James Wan back for even though this film could have no way been on the same level as \"The Conjuring\" and \"The Conjuring 2\" it still could have been fresh in the right hands. To me, Gary Dauberman's writing has not shined for I felt both Annabelle movies were subpar and I believe he is getting too much credit for \"It\" when he revised the script and the material was based on a book. The characters were underdeveloped, uninteresting, and lacked emotion. This movie is purely for those who only care about jump scares and have a lack of care for acting, direction, and a good story. This serves as a Halloween flick to entertain the squeamish teenagers who rate a movie based on jump scares and a scary nun. If only the movie was given more time and not rushed to make money off of \"The Conjuring 2\"'s success.\n\n2.3/5"

I and the movie would argue so.\n\nWhile Marvel is quite succesful with their Universe, Conjuring created a Horror universe with quite some good movies. The first Annabelle may not have been up there quality wise, but the sequel made up for that. And this is fine too and was hinted at in Conjuring itself (and Annabelle Sequel). But we do get new players here, as was the case with the Annabelle Origin story. Now this will not shock hardcore horror fans that much, but it was made for a general audience anyway. Don't hold that against it. And yes cliches and predictabilities are high - there's still room to watch and enjoy/be scared though"

        "review_detailed_main": "I like what they've done with \"The Conjuring\" by making it its own universe like Marvel and DC. Most scary movie franchises just run one sequel after the other, but \"The Conjuring\" got creative and I appreciate it. As a result we get \"The Nun,\" yet another one of their malevolent and frightening beings.\n\nThe movie takes place in Romania 1953. Just outside of a small village existed a castle that had been there for centuries. It was inhabited by nuns, who were in perpetual prayer to seal up the evil that had tried, or was trying to escape from it. After a nun was found hanging outside of the church/castle- what looked to be a cardinal sin-the church sent Father Burke (Demian Bichir) and Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga, Vera Farmiga's sister), a nun-in-training, out to investigate.\n\nThey were dealing with a powerful evil. So, whereas the predictable happened--small, almost insignificant occurrences that dramatically built up to more--this malevolent force was even more physical than I expected.\n\n\"The Nun\" was about on par with what I thought it would be. There were the standard issue jump scares, very ferocious looking spirits, and things that truly did not exist. I thought it was done well, even if it was a bit by the numbers."

In my review of Dark Waters n A Cure for Wellness, I mentioned that cinematography n atmosphere ain't enuff to save a bad film but this film ain't bad. It is well acted n directed n unlike the other two this wasn't boring at all. Compared to the recent pg13 horror films by Warner Bros, this film has a little blood but the only bothering trend continuing in all these films (Insidious, Conjuring, Annabelle 2 n this film) is the lack of kills. Nobody seems to die in these films apart from Annabelle 1. People r thrown away, people r pushed against walls n pillars but they seem to survive. Of course, this film has some offscreen kills n this is one of the reason y its different from the above films. The priest scene with the hat n bag was also similar to The Exorcist. In the future I hope they show some good amount of blood n on screen kills in such films."

And this is not saved by the promising director (Corin Hardy) or two great actors like Taissa Farmiga in her role of naive novice and Demi\u00e9n Bichir as the priest back from everything. And they are not helped by that third character who is so artificial, the typical french gallant who should have a more important dramatic charge for reasons that cannot be revealed.\n\nAll the scares, or rather attempts at scares, are based on the circular tracking shot of the character to be scared and the blurring of the background.\n\nI think many of its problems come from wasted scenery and a rather poor editing.\n\nGood points: Taissa Farmiga and the cinematography.\n\nBad Points: Everything there is."

The plot is very cliche, basically theres evil and we must contain it. I can also point out something that the movie overuses, like A LOT, i can recall at least five moments of someone/something spooky, then the camera pans away to the side and it just vanishes, which honestly did nothing for me the first time let alone the fifth time. Meh movie, not aggressively bad, but not a masterpiece. 6/10."

One of my favourite movies. I forgot to mention that this movie is pure horror. You need to be a true fan to understand it. Also, the fact that valak had so much power even though the demon was surrounded by hundreds of crosses gave me chills. What i did not like is that the juat contained the evil and not lock it. Also a demon fears its own name and the actors never mentioned it in front of valak. But for me its ok because this movie opened the way for an even scarier sequel.\ud83d\ude08\ud83d\ude08"

The Stalinist-minded regime that was established was extremely hostile to any and all religions. While they were somewhat lenient to the local orthodox church (which was merged with the church of Russia in an effort to control all religious organisations within Eastern Block countries), they were extremely hostile to all catholic institutions,, closing all schools and churches, while the Vatican itself was an enemy of the State.\n\nin the movie a Catholic priest goes to investigate the suicide of a nun in a CATHOLIC convent in Romania in 1952.\n\nI am not Romanian and therefore did not know all this background . It took me less than 30 minutes to find all the information on the matter and understand that the setting of this movie is not improbable, it is IMPOSSIBLE.

The film doesn't only rely on the usual jump scares but has extended atmospheric passages that increase tension towards the end. The dramatic climax and falling action make for a final third that was among the most entertaining in horror cinema of recent memory. Another positive point are the characters as Father Burke intrigues as experienced veteran with a gloomy past while Sister Irene convinces as charming, intelligent and resilient young woman and the French farmer charms with his gentle manners. The three characters investigating a supernatural phenomenon complement one another perfectly. The acting performances are also very solid.\n\nThe only thing I would have done differently are the two references to the Conjuring franchise right at the exposition of the film and at the unnecessary resolution. The Nun is good enough to stand on its own and doesn't need these references. I would even go as far to say that this movie is actually better than the somewhat exchangeable main franchise.\n\nIf you like atmospheric horror movies with great characters and very good actresses and actors, The Nun will certainly entertain you from start to finish. You don't need to be familiar with The Conjuring to appreciate and understand this film. The Nun turned out much better than I expected and is the best horror movie I have seen so far this year."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Nun\n\nCatholic demonic mythology is one of my favorite genres. It combines just enough historical facts with superstition that lend plausibility that this could happen.\n\nWhen I saw this, I was unaware of the connection to the Conjuring films until later in the film, so well played movie. Well played. The Conjuring films are really good, and I liked the connection.\n\nRegarding The Nun as a stand alone movie, I really liked it. Horror movies with religious aspects work really well set in the past where there is no electricity or phones, and people being alone in the dark is a common set up. In 1952, a priest and a novitiate go to an abbey in Romania to investigate the suicide of one of the nuns living in an ancient castle that had become an abbey. They team up with a quasi-local who is a French Canadian who moved there.\n\nCreepy castle, dark misty cemetery, jump scares, a great score, and appropriate use of lighting: The Nun checked off the boxes. The crew did a great job with the sets and ambience. I felt like I was playing a creepy video game but with not enough horror to give me any real scares.\n\nThe premise of the movie intrigued me. The use of Valak hiding in the guise of a nun was actually genius. There are generations of Catholic kids who were scared of nuns that this may have brought back childhood traumas. The thought that the movie played up to that impressed me.\n\nThe acting is pretty bad, and the script wasn't well written. This is 1952, chanting in Latin to keep evil at bay is expected. There are no Romanian accents, and the main priest screams in English with the actor's native Mexican accent. Casting Taissa Farmiga, sister of the main female character in the Conjuring, was a great idea. She was the highlight of the acting in the movie, other than Valak herself."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Nun (3.5 out of 5 stars).\n\nThe Nun is a pretty decent supernatural horror film that is a spin off from The Conjuring 2 with the creepy demonic nun. Lets face it, the brief moment the nun was in The Conjuring 2 was creepy and gave you the chills. Now for a full prequel movie about how the nun came to be. And a backstory to a specific character that explored when her and a priest went investigating to Romania after two catholic nuns were attacked. It seems like an interesting spin off that deserved its own movie. It was better than the other spin off like the Annabelle movies. Still below the two Conjuring movies.\n\nThe plot follows two nuns getting attacked by a mysterious nun in 1952. Father Burke (Demian Birchir) and Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga) both travel to Romania to investigate these nuns death. They meet Frenchie (Jonas Bloquet) who guides them to the monastery. Were they encountering the creepy nun that stalks the corridors and anyone that is there.\n\nI felt like the plot was predictable and is something you can see coming. A nun is attacked by some creepy nun which is trying to find a host of a new body. A father and a sister head out to the castle to investigate the strange occurrences. Not too long, until they begin seeing this demonic nun that is trapping them in coffins, bringing back tragic visions, and stalking them in a dark eerie castle.\n\nThe film does have a fair share of scares and jumping at the screen moments. When you least expect it, something comes at you. Plus the set design of the castle and direction of the movie does make you feel unease. With a tone that is dark and dimmed lighting. Characters walking in dark corridors and a shadow of a nun walking slowly. Making it difficult to tell if it is an innocent person or some creepy entity.\n\nDemian Bichir was decent playing father Burke who has a tragic past with exorcisms. Taissa Farmiga is the perfect choice playing sister Irene. Cannot see anyone else portraying the character. Which her real life sister Vera Farmiga is in The Conjuring. Seeing the resemblance of these two actresses are very alike. Jonas Bloquet plays Frenchie, a guy that guides them but is attracted to Irene when he first sees her. Sure, if you pay close attention to the Conjuring movies, you may notice an easter egg or connection on certain characters.\n\nOverall, The Nun is a pretty fair horror film. It delivers on the scares and jumps. The direction is dark and eerie and helped build the creepy tone. The cast is good and Taissa Farmiga was perfect. The film does struggle with a weak story and backstory to the origins of the Nun which was briefly shown."

It's well worth watching and is very obviously being review-bombed for reasons I cannot fathom.\n\nSetup: an apparent suicide at a deeply isolated Convent of vast Gothic proportions. Body is discovered by local French-Canadian farmer. A Priest with a history is sent to investigate, along with a pre-Nun who 'has visions'.\n\nThere follow a load of set-pieces that are supposed to be scary, but really just add some flavour. All the 'jump' moments are clearly telegraphed with ground-shaking sound effects and they're mostly very predictable, but no worse for that. Crucially, there is an abundant lack of The Stoopid that plagues so many horrors. Everyone acts more or less exactly as they should in the given context. The characters are believable and likeable.\n\nThe only thing I can really think of as a negative is the completely inexplicable splitting up of the three leads at the end, which serves no purpose other than to add drama (given that two of them can do literally nothing of any use without the third), but even that is forgivable since it gives each a chance to deal with their own respective demons.\n\nIf you're a fan of The Conjuring series, this is a fine addition. If you're just here for The Nun herself, be aware she only appears very briefly - but is still very much worth it"

The trailer is terrifying in the best way, which is a combination of fun-terrifying and terrifying-terrifying. The mysterious figure lurking in the background, the creepy whisper, a well-executed jump scare-it's all there. Such an auspicious trailer seemed to promise an equally fulfilling feature film, but that was most definitely not the case. This one is a giant miss.\n\n'The Nun' tells the background of the haunting and horrifying demon, Valak, who poses as a nun. It's a brilliant idea. Turning one of most trusted and purely benevolent entities (nuns) into a mysterious demonic form is pure nightmare fuel. Aside from blatantly looking creepy, part of what makes the demon nun so scary is the mystery of it all. A backstory detracts from that. Once we understand more about this demon and know how to defeat it, we're that much less afraid. With that in mind, a story like this, which spends a lot of plot time on exposition of Valak, seems doomed to fail.\n\nOther poor choices also doomed this movie from the jump. There's a character in it named Frenchie, who is funny and charming and comforting. All of the qualities are wonderful in most movies but completely out of place in this one. The movie takes itself extremely seriously but is constantly undercut by how funny this guy is. With his effortless (and possibly unintentional) humor he hijacks any chance this movie had of successfully scaring its viewers. I don't blame the actor for this, and I think he could thrive in the appropriate film. Casting him was a filmmaking mistake.\n\nNot that the movie would have worked that well with a more serious character replacing Frenchie. All the jump scares are carried out in a familiar, predictable pattern. The camera follows the main character, then she hears something, then the camera pans to the sound but there's nothing there, then the camera pans back to her and something is behind her. Boo! Then repeat this sequence 30 more times until the jump \"scares\" did nothing more than elicit a yawn. There's virtually zero effort given, and the demon nun is used to about 30% of its potential.\n\nSimilarly, the CGI did nothing to aid the scares. It too often looks too fake, almost cartoonish. The further away from reality that the movies takes us, the less scary it becomes. If the demon looks obviously fake, then we start thinking about how all of this is obviously fake, and we become less afraid. Practical effects are much more effective in these instances.\n\nOverall, this movie left me massively disappointed. A creepy character is misused, another character is miscast, and I felt misled about this movie's potential. 'The Conjuring' universe has some excellent films and some duds. This one is a dud."

They have to face something much more sinister, in the form of a demon nun.\n\nThe Nun is a good film. It doesn't deserve the universal bashing it has received, from critics & moviegoers alike. Director Corin Hardy maintains a Gothic & eerie atmosphere throughout the movie. He has given us a worthy addition to the Conjuring franchise. This film matches up to or maybe even surpasses Annabelle: Creation(2017). It doesn't quite match up to The Conjuring(2013) or The Conjuring 2(2016). However, it is much better than Annabelle(2014). There are three or four well executed jump scares in the movie. The ending is a bit silly but, effective nonetheless. The connection to the Conjuring universe is awesome. The cinematography by Maxime Alexandre is fantastic. Demian Bichir is brilliant as Father Burke. Taissa Farmiga is spectacular as Sister Irene. Jonas Bloquet is awesome as Frenchie. Bonnie Aarons is outstanding as The Nun. Ingrid Bisu is great as Sister Oana. Charlotte Hope is impressive as Sister Victoria. The supporting cast is brilliant. The Nun is worth a watch in theaters. Just lower your expectations & you won't be disappointed."

If you go in expecting movies to be on the same level of The Conjuring or Hereditary, then you will probably be disappointed. Whatever happened to just throwing all preconceived notions out the window and just enjoying it at face value? Why does everyone have to try to rate movies as if they're Siskel and Ebert? Why not just let yourself enjoy something without picking it apart? Is it the best horror movie...no, but it was decent. The Nun herself is nightmare inducing, Taissa Farmiga gave an AMAZING performance as well. The plot could have been done a little better, fleshing out the story a bit more. I'd like to know what happened before The Nun. Anyway, it's just a simple review, with my thoughts on the horror genre. Fact is, there just aren't enough good haunted house movies, and demonic possession movies, such as The Conjuring. I'd been following the Warren's work for years before The Conjuring was released. I've read nearly all of their books. I find this subject truly fascinating, as it's my favorite subgenre of movies/television. I've learned to keep my standards a bit lower and try to just enjoy the movies we get, whether they're perfect or not. ;)"

In some movies, the events are depicted like the real world scenarios where things move from their own and then at last, it reveals. But here, its not that.\n\nIt will scare you.. one thing I loved about the movie is the soundtrack CORRIDOR OF CROSSES!! OMG what an amazing masterpiece is that!!! It will directly hit your soul.\n\nAs a sum up.. I liked the story but as i told you about \"TASTE\". So, i will give it a 7. Must watch the film.. Its amazing from a different POV,, especially for the people, who really love getting a scary physical ghostly entity... ITS REALLY AMAZING (from that POV).. It will scare you for sure."

They are guided by local Frenchie (Jonas Bloquet).\n\nI was with this movie all the way up to a buried Father Burke being rescued. It's a solid horror up to that point. First, there is a jarring disconnection with the duo returning the next morning. The movie falls into a constant regurgitation of dark hallways and dark figures and random interiors. It's mind-numbing and not scary at all. It doesn't help that the general layout of the abbey is not clear or declared at all. The second half is a constant downhill slide to the bottom."

Director Corin Hardy had to just take the same formula other movies in the franchise have been using and the movie would have turned out to be okay. Instead we get a movie whose parody will be more scary. The Nun was the single most reason why the Conjuring 2 was scary! How can you take a character who has already been established and screw up? James Wan frightened viewers more in just a couple of scenes than what this movie manages in its entire runtime. Heck! Even Annabelle Creation had a few scary scenes even though it shares the same stupidity of characters. The Nun is supposed to be a demon who is malevolent than anything witnessed. But all it does is scream at characters and choke them. I would understand if Valak was intended to mirror what the viewing audience was feeling at the moment about character decisions. But sadly, the scares fall flat even before the jump. It's sad to see Valak being wasted away like this. This is a scary movie that is anything but scary."

I don't think it deserves all the bad reviews its getting, it does have some set-pieces that work pretty well. The acting and atmospherics were really good, but that's all it has really.\n\nIf there is one reason why you should see it though, is how it ties into the previous films.

The movie has some pretty good jump scare scenes I must say.\n\nI have watched this movie when it really came out back in 2018 but now that Nun II is coming tomorrow, I got excited to watch this movie one more time before I go for the part 2.\n\nHopefully the sequel for the Nun will be good. Trailer for nun 2 looks really promising. Can't wait to watch the movie at the theater."

So when I saw The Nun, also in theaters, I was not aware what was done with the character in Conjuring 2, where the nun was basically the main antagonist. I am not sure if that would have changed my opinion of this film though, while some scares do land and there is good tension at times, it was an overall flat film with no real takeaways from it. The Conjuring 2 already did it better and all in all feels like an unnecessary entry in their universe."

Trust me, I'm the type of person who watches horror movies just tp relax. The film was scary, James Wan delivered what he promised. Great prequal (or spinoff) of the conjuring movies. Taissa Farmiga was great as sister Irene. And the actress playing the nun? Oh my God, she did such a good job on scarying the s*** out of her audience. How this movie has such a low rating is beyond my comprehension. Conclusin: don't listen to all the negative reviews, go see it yourself and be the judge of it."

They had run out of the drink I wanted, so they added extra cookies and replacement drinks.\n\nAs our heroes travelled further into the depths of the abbey, so I sank deeper into a sugar coma. Brief flickering moments of consciousness provided me with enough to follow the story.\n\nThere were a few chuckles from the two dimensional cliches that helped rouse me from my unearthly slumber.\n\nTo make it through The Nun you will need to be well slept and in peak physical condition.

The catholic correlation brings in the essence that conjurverse is known for. I could've raised a star for this one had they excluded the stupid jump scares & a few out of the context dialogues. Over ridden visuals & illogical response in certain scenarios are certainly the drowning factors. The movie is stretched so as to maintain length as the overall story is like a folklore.\n\nIt deserves a 5/10 A average movie to watch."

So ill add that one star review to this one to make two stars. To me personally if i can watch a conjuring movie in a thunderstorm with all the lights off and then sleep like a baby, it wasn't truly a conjuring story to me.\n\nI believe they should have kept it present day with the conjuring before trying to make it into a \" take it back to the beginning \" kind of story because this missed the mark. I hope if their is a conjuring part 4 that it is nothing like the last two films put out in the conjuring universe."

A priest accompanied by a young nun, who has yet to take her own vows, are sent to the abbey by the Vatican to investigate the reason behind a suicide there. What they find out will test them to their very limits as they battle against a force so evil, it will take all the faith that they have to survive.\n\nThis movie relies heavily on atmosphere, visuals, and shadow - trying to elicit scares using jump tactics and camera movement. The plot is rather weak and subdued with little narrative or back story. Some of the twists are confusing and hard to follow.\n\nThere is plenty of your typical horror film fluff here. For example, a character turning slowly to look one way and then turning back to have someone or something standing right behind them in the dark. There are some other usual little gimmicks employed here, such as little ringing bells, eyes glowing in the dark, a radio that turns on by itself, hands reaching out of dark places, and a religious relic needed to save the day ... etc etc etc. These are things we have already seen, and used again here.\n\nThis wasn't a bad movie per se, but it really wasn't good either. It is pretty generic, worth watching once. Maybe even entertaining enough to keep. It's good enough to keep as part of the Conjuring Universe of movies if you are into collecting. Maybe I'll pull it out and watch it again sometime down the road, but even if I don't, I won't miss it."

But then, when have demonic-possession movies ever really spelled out the entire backstory, or motivations, of the demons depicted in them? I didn't find the movie especially scary either. Maybe that's because on my first watch I was kinda distracted and doing other stuff while still paying attention to the story, or maybe it just wasn't scary. Either way, IDC I enjoyed it both times I watched it last night."

And what's best of all? A French Canadian is there to help the two main characters around in Romania. Why even set the event in a foreign country if you're going to get the facts wrong, and you'll miss all the authenticity of a culture? Better just stay out and choose something that you can actually handle. It's a 6, because it was still entertaining, though quite predictable."

There isn't any one of the main characters you could feel attached to. (Unlike the Conjuring, where you could really get behind Patrick Wilson.) Good points? The cinematography is OK, and the ambient mood and atmosphere is spot on, but like the spirits that haunt the monastery - it kind of lacks substance."

Risking their lives they have to try their best in order to solve the mystery behind the death of the young nun and shield the demonic force.\n\nDespite all the bad reviews which I have read I have to admit that I liked this movie. It had a nice and interesting plot with many good scenes and a very clever conection to \"The Conjuring\". I also enjoyed the direction which was made by Corin Hardy and I believe that he did a great job on it. Regarding the interpretations, I liked very much the interpretation of Demi\u00e1n Bichir's who played as Father Burke and Taissa Farmiga's who played as Sister Irene. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Jonas Bloquet's who played as Frenchie and he gave a different touch on this movie and Bonnie Aarons who played as The Nun.\n\nTo sum up, I have to say that \"The Nun\" is a nice, entertaining horror movie with a decent plot and a good direction. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to like it. If you have already watched and liked some other movies like \"The Conjuring\", \"The Conjuring 2\", \"Annabelle\" and \"Annabelle: Creation\" then you definately have to watch this movie too."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Nun (2018), the fifth installment in the conjuring cinematic universe was good as a stand alone movie however did not live up to its predecessors. The scares were a little few and far between in the middle of the film (relying to heavily on jumps), however did pick up the pace towards the end. I particularly enjoyed Taissa Farminga's portrayal of Sister Irene however I felt the character Frenchie added little to he movie (if you've seen you'll know he did fill in a major part of the story at the end). His jokes often fell flat, other than his exclaimation of 'holy s**t' when Sister Irene discovered a vial of Christ's blood (I was the only one who laughed). The close ups of the nun herself were very good, I thought the effects/makeup of the veins were very realistic. The plot of the movie was overall rather good and I enjoyed the back story to the abbey. The abbey itself combined with the Catholic imagery did definitely make this 'the darkest chapter in the conjuring universe', not for the scares but for the theme. The tie-in to the rest of the franchise was very good and I definitely didn't see it coming. Despite the fact the movie was good, I did come away slightly disappointed. Overall I award 6/10 stars, it was missing elements which make the other conjuring movies so great and unique (awesome camera pans, final shot when nothing happens before the credits etc.)"

Pretty much none of their actions or reactions feel even remotely believable, or make any sense.\n\nAnd the story? The supposed back-story they gave to The Nun? Dreadful. A huge clich\u00e9 that manages to taint what The Conjuring built on. It's a real shame that the two movies are related, because The Conjuring at least was fun. This one is just a boring, nonsensical and forced chain of predictable jump-scares."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's no point mincing words, the utter terribleness and blandness of The Nun legitimately surprised me.\n\nTaking what was one of the most memorable and unnerving aspects of the great Conjuring 2 , in the form of demonic nun and in need of a dentist Valak, The Nun felt like a nice natural step forward for James Wan's horror universe, but thanks to this effort, this universe feels placed in a precarious position outside of the Warren's fight against evil, despite The Nun rounding up some resounding box office figures over the weekend of its initial release.\n\nMaking 2014's Annabelle look like a cinematic horror masterpiece, The Hallow director Corin Hardy directs Valak's story, that focuses on Demian Bichir's Father Burke and Taissa Farmiga's nun in waiting Sister Irene's journey to Romania to investigate a convent that isn't all the holy, without an ounce of imagination or creativity, making this 90 minute exercise an arduous and increasingly over blown outing.\n\nAmounting to what seems like endless scenes of Father Burke and Sister Irene wondering around the (incredibly smoky and foggy) convent grounds chasing shadows, shaking off hands in the walls and staying far too long at an Airbnb that doesn't allow for a normal night's sleep, The Nun is an almost scare free exercise in how to turn a frightening character into a lame and tired supporting act.\n\nIn the cinema screening I attended on opening night, you could sense the dwindling interests of audience members, while unlike The Nun's polished forefathers, the lack of screams or nervous laughter was a sight to behold.\n\nSo silly and unbelievable are many of The Nun's set-ups that it's impossible to feel any real sense of danger or unease, which is due to a number of glaringly obvious factors such as a lack of character engagement, frequently daft narrative movements and sign-posted scares that take away any potentially potent moments that The Nun may've provided it's unfortunate paying audience members.\n\nCome the film's shockingly overblown and fright free finale, you know well and truly that The Nun is a product of not a lot of thought or care, an example of the worst of what modern day horror can offer when done wrong.\n\nFinal say -\n\nTake away the connection to the Conjuring brand name and The Nun would've been a straight to home release low-budget nasty. Ruining the character of Valak and tarnishing the future of further Conjuring spin-off's, The Nun is an unholy mess you'd do well to avoid.\n\n1 vial of blood out of 5"

However the movie does keep you engaged I wanted to see what would happen next what something meant and how characters would get out of a certain situation. The plot was lacking and was a bit idiotic however it did make sense. The part that I really liked was the humour of the movie because in my opinion it was qute funny and I loved the jokes maybe it was my friends that mare it more fun but the whole crowd made jokes and was laughing it was indeed a funny. Overall I wouldnt watch it again and I would ave preffered not paying 11 euros for this film if you would like to watch it I would recommend watching at home with some friends and would really enjoy it then - as I should have done -"

I didn't think it was scary to the point of stressful, but I had no problem with the acting. Taissa Farmiga stole the show as the central character being the young nun. You'll remember her from 'American Horror Story', and her older sister is Vera Farmigo from the Conjuring films. There were plenty of jump scares in the film, and I think that's why most people go. But the hardcore horror fans have already deemed this film as boring, so you'll need to decide if you should see this based on people you've met and trusted on the internet who evaluate films. I'm easy to please with horror films, so I'm a happy customer. This film reminded me of the Christopher Lee 'Dracula' films from the '60's.\n\nOther actors you should watch in this film include: Bonnie Aarons who played the demon nun, and Ingrid Biru, who played Sister Oana. Biru studied various languages in Romania, including Latin, which helps in key supporting roles that you see in this film. Get ready for more James Wan films, and I count three more proposed for production in the next two or three years."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\n\n2018 is being a year of extremes for horror movies. A Quiet Place and Hereditary are both original and incredibly suspenseful, while Slender Man is probably the worst film I've seen so far. The Conjuring Universe is a surprisingly entertaining horror franchise that no one really expected it to be hugely successful. I love The Conjuring series and the second Annabelle movie is also pretty great, so my expectations for The Nun were, at least, hopeful.\n\nUnfortunately, The Nun not only proves that its marketing was false and misleading, but it is also such a tedious, lazy and generic horror flick. I didn't watch a single trailer, I only caught a few clips here and there. However, I couldn't escape the constant polemic news about how \"too scary\" this film was. Trailers being banned on particular countries and theaters forbidding the release of the movie ... Honestly, that has to be all fake.\n\nFear is subjective. Every person has different fears so it is understandable that some people can get scared by something easier than others. Nevertheless, I don't understand how people can get genuinely scared by an obvious jump scare and a shaky close-up of a demon's face ... Repeatedly. Basically, this is The Nun. Every scare is based on a cliche fake-out of where Valak might be so he can appear somewhere else or through \"on-the-nose\" foreshadowing.\n\nI can barely find an original or creative scene. Everything in this film is inspired by other movies that did the stunt better. The Nun fails on what it promised the most: being scary. On top of this, the story is another major problem. Every piece of information is given through a lazy exposition scene accompanied by some flashbacks and these moments are oddly fast. Literally, in one minute, everything the audience needs to remember about Valak is explicitly said by a random character. The same thing happens when it comes to developing Father Burke's (Demi\u00e1n Bichir) past or even when the film tries to connect with the others.\n\nIn addition to the dull screenplay, Gary Dauberman gives close to zero characterization to the main characters. They are all horror stereotypes, so expect people making stupid decisions or following silly trails. Logic is not a strong attribute of this movie since the presence of some characters in certain places remains unjustified at this moment. With such a short runtime, it is baffling how little effort went to the script. This spinoff could have been a great popcorn film, but instead, it is just a mess.\n\nThere are a few saving graces. The cast is really great, and Taissa Farmiga (Sister Irene) completely carries the movie. If something captivated me during these 90 minutes, it was Farmiga's brilliant performance. Her character is the only one that actually receives some good development with it coming from various sources, instead of another exposition rant. However, I'm perplexed at the choice of Vera Farmiga's sister to portray Sister Irene. Since the characters they both portray aren't related, it is at least doubtful how two unrelated persons can be almost identical. Definitely, a nit-picky thing from my part but I couldn't help to find it a bit confusing.\n\nDemi\u00e1n Bichir is excellent as the priest, but his character is ultimately flat. The biggest surprise is Jonas Bloquet as Frenchie since he portrays the comic relief character. Yes, you read it right: The Nun has funny moments. For a lot of people, it might be an issue since they want to see a horror film, not a comedy. However, Bloquet's script is just funny enough and I never felt that there was an exaggeration of one-liners. I consider it a breath of fresh air in an otherwise weighty horror tone.\n\nCorin Hardy undoubtedly struggled to be imaginative, but technically his movie is pretty okay. Some cool set designs, a touch of good cinematography here and there, and a chilling score that, unfortunately, falls into the cliche of announcing an eventual jump scare. He is able to provide a consistent tone with an occasional joke, but he couldn't handle the story the way he should have, so the pacing ends up suffering a punch, even for such a short runtime.\n\nAll in all, The Nun is just forgettable. It is just another horror flick that follows every generic plot point, it is filled with cliche characters, and it possesses uninspired not-that-scary sequences that other films did way better. Corin Hardy lacks the mindset to direct a successful horror movie, and the screenplay is evidence number one since it is an explicitly lazy exposition party. In the end, the cast saves the day with Farmiga delivering a fantastic performance, plus some technical attributes worthy of some merit, which help the film to perform not as bad as it would."

It is pretty good. The main problem is that there are story flaws, elements in the plot that need to be explained but end up not being explained. The jumps are very good, though, and it is overall a very creepy movie. Some scenes were really scary, yet still not as scary as the other Conjuring movies. Better than Annabelle, it has some great scenes and I recommend it."

Without stepping into spoiler territory I'll keep it to the point.\n\nThe first 20mins starts off pretty decent but after that it just becomes sad. Typical jump scares throughout the movie you can literally see them all coming, crusafix turning upside down, it's just more of the same stuff. The acting was good, there is a particularly over dramatic character who did a pretty good job.\n\nWhen James Wan created this universe of horror and paranormal it was fantastic, I honestly feel that the director Corin Hardy done a half assed job. This movie could of been HUGE! But he failed at being original and instead tried to be comercial. Literally nothing amazing or worth remembering comes from this movie. You will forget 99% of it by the time you go to bed. I actually think Corin Hardy may have just ended the conjuring universe. However we do have Halloween soon.\n\nMy opinion keep Corin Hardy away from horrors and leave him to his fairies and more. If there is a sequel find someone else. This was an insult of a movie to those horror fanatics!\n\navoid."

And as a standalone horror, this film is mediocre at best.\n\n\"The Nun\" didn't attract my attention from the very beginning, and as it went on it was more and more dull. Technically, it is nicely filmed and is adorned with decent acting and atmosphere, but the story is at the same time undeveloped and drawn out and the horror is almost exclusively based on jump-scare moments and clich\u00e9s of the genre, while it completely disappoints in building tension and tying the audience to the characters. At least if it was really scary I could forgive the lack of depth and strength, but no. If you find this scary, Freddy Krueger would have caused you a heart attack. The funny remark in my title and the cuteness of the lead actress were the only bright spots of this nonsensical film until the very end, and I didn't turn it off halfway through just because I was watching it with my kid, and he wouldn't continue without me.\n\nThe final plot twist, which is neither original nor unexpected, but for some reason I did not foresee it, probably due to a general lack of interest, gives a little sense to the up to that point seemingly meaningless story and improves the overall impression from a rather poor to a mediocre film.\n\n6/10."

I did not find any comedy in this movie at all except maybe one line near the beginning other then that i have no idea how people are finding this movie comical. Great atmosphere, good tension in certain areas, and the setting for this movie make it the most freakiest movie to me in the conjuring universe and top 3 scariest of all time for me. The plot was good, not great but horror movies tend to have a simple plot in my opinion after seeing so many. I feel like the movie could have been better by having less jump scare scenes but those scenes I thought were great in my opinion. This movie deserves to be watched in absolute silence as theres only 3 main characters and not a lot of talking takes place. There is dialogue but not as much as you would think. You either will like this movie or hate it I feel like but to me I liked it a lot as not a lot of horror movies have great scenery and atmosphere to go with the movie and wow this movie definitely does in my opinion. The abbey itself is creepy and so is the graveyard plus the lack of lighting(candles basically) add more depth. I say go see it and review it yourself as I seen some reviews here that I feel like are way off from the movie I seen."

It was good enough for the first 15 minutes. It's a shame the movie getting worse as the time goes by. This movie depends a lot to Valak's popularity and jumpscares. She was iconic character from The Conjuring 2 and people are curious enough about her story. She left a good impression in the previous movie but not on this one. And the jumpscare(s).., are too easy to be predicted. Just as the usual cliche horror movie. Besides all the flaws, I want to give my compliment to the movie set. The only thing that gives me horror vibe in The Nun was the place. The abbey, the woods, the cemetery.. love it! Overall, I am just disappointed. This is not a good outcome."

The second Conjuring film had some good points, yet left me feeling that the fresh ideas were beginning to run dry.

In spite of what seemed to be a healthy budget, the writers forced otherwise decent actors to death march through a script, that missed dozens of opportunities for decent scares, and plagued the audience with numerous absolutely nonsensical sequences. And what wasn't written into the action was ham fistedly explained in a hopelessly forced discussion of the abbey's dark history.\n\nIn the end the only thing keeping me up at night about this film was whether or not they'll beat another sequel out of this dead horse or, god willing, let the tired old fella die."

This isn't a haunted house and demonic possessions.\n\nThe music (you'll know when you hear it) is beautifully chilling. I don't know how to describe it. I'm a firm believer in the ability of a film's soundtrack can either make or break the movie. It fit perfectly in the scenes with Valek's appearances.\n\nI love the story of how Valek came to be and how the demon disguises itself to walk amongst the other nuns in the convent. I honestly don't see why people are hating on it so much. Just because it didn't scare them doesn't mean it isn't scary. Will it win an Oscar? Of course not. I still believe it's worth a watch to fans of The Conjuring films."

        "review_detailed_main": "I just got back from seeing what I thought would be a great and scary addition to THE CONJURING series, especially considering how they introduced her charcater in the second entry in the franchise. Even though the nun herself was a fictional figure it was definately one of the great scare points of the second film. That being said, I was looking forward to her first stand alone film, I even had high hopes when I heard that Corin Hardy was directing it & James Wan was attached.\n\nCorin Hardy wrote and directed 'The Hallow' back in 2015 which was a great original piece of horror cinema. That wasn't the case in this film, Hardy only directed which was a waste due to his writing talent would have benefitted this film.\n\nThe writing was the only problem I had with this film, it had some great elements of dread in it as well as great theological aspects to add to the story. The characters were introduced and were placed nicely and were cast in my opinion perfectly, but for a film that carries such horror and dread the humour was spread a bit much so much in fact that it detoured and took away from the horror of the film. Speaking of the horror or I should say lack of, that was another issue I had problems with...that being said:\n\nThe film starts off superbly atmospheric and very dark, as you would expect considering who the film is about. It opens in the mountains of Romania in 1952, the dilapidated gothic nunnery is where we are introduced to two nuns who willing unleash THE NUN'S unholy wrath for some reason which we are never explained. This ritual leads to the death and suicides of the two women which attracts the attention of the Catholic Church who send off a investigator - Father Burke (played by Demi\u00e1n Bichir of Dom Hemingway) and a postulant, which is a nun who has yet to take her vows - Sister Irene (played by AHS's Taissa Farmiga). Once in Romania, they meet our comedy aspect of the film \"Frenchie\" (played by Jonas Bloquet of Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets) who is the young man who accompanies them into the so-called pit of hell which sadly never rears its ugly face. Thankfully, we are blessed with the return of Bonnie Aarons (who originally played The Nun in the Conjuring 2), sadly though her part is short due to we don't see much in her in the film but the scenes that she is in she does her best as a daemonic nun that we all loved so much. I feel that they focused more on the other characters and not the nun as much as they should have.\n\nAnother thing was the various cliched jump scares and the humour that sorely was not needed, like I said before the film itself could have been a full on in your face scarefest but it was as if the writer wanted to play it safe. I will say this there is a nice lil twist about midway that was somewhat enjoyable and added much to the film, but the ending once again was textbook and downplayed. There was so much potential and direction that the film could have gone in, THE NUN could have been another horror icon of this generation...\n\nSadly, she'll never wear her habit again....unless you watch The Conjuring 2."

It has nothing to do with the other Conjuring movies and the Warrens were in it for 3 seconds. They waste a young spitting image version of Vera that they could've used for another movie on a girl who just runs and screams. The whole thing takes place in a church that looks like a bad 80s hairband video. There's a useless priest and a guy whose whole personality is being Frenchie, who at one point speaks entirely fake French. Nothing happens for 2 hrs except running, screaming, and being chased by Marilyn Manson in a nun outfit. No plot, terrible dialogue, no scares, makes no sense, no back story, no resolution, no point. You'd have more scares and plot if you got completely wasted and ran through a local carnival's haunted haymaze come October. Way more fun. If I had seen this in a theater instead of a plane I would've walked out. The good news is, I now get to live in peace knowing I will never again see anything this bad, as this is bad as movies get.

To think of this; a nun walks out of a monastery and finds herself cornered by a fox near a waterfall... She immediately repents of her trespasses as it must happen because of her inefficacy. Or a Muslim walks through an alley in a neighborhood and hears a whimper near-by though he sees no one... He immediately says the prayer of Ayat al-Kursi (The Throne Verse - 2 : 255 in the Gracious Koran) in a low voice to take refuge in Allah as it could be the doing of a godless djinn.\n\nIn this movie, we are not to experience some horror with casual link. In fact, this is not a horror movie but an anthology of, a requiem for the old ways and understandings in Christianity. So, I could not rate it as a horror movie.\n\nOne can see the vividness concerning the movie set, as it speaks to us - to the modern people - in half decay, half promise. Because of this, I have felt the mournful horror; not the gory horror watching the movie.\n\nScience, as it is of comfort, strips us off the essence, the esprit... So, we can be stuck with the question of how Father Burke is buried, or how a ground is holy, or how Valak posseses Frenchie when it is seen fighting Sister Irene, if only \"the cause and effect principle\" is of our way approaching this movie. That is why, I like this movie. Okay, its poster makes it seem like a mediocre horror flick; and its artistic execution might have been much better reinforced with some innovatory, epochal scaring tactics. But I don't think it deserves such low rating. Valak may be responsible. (What?.. I am modern enough!)\n\nThere is the Verse of my culture here upon the matter:\n\n\"Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of the Daybreak * From the evil of that which He created; * From the evil of the darkness when it is intense, * And from the evil of malignant witchcraft, * And from the evil of the envier when he envieth.\"\n\nAllah wills so in the Chapter of Al-Falaq (The Daybreak) in the Gracious Koran. Sadaqa Allaah al-'Azeem (Allah, the Most High, Speaks the truth.)"

Although it was supposed to be horrifying, only one person is actually killed and there were no scares other than the demon jumping out a few times. Hardly original.

The best scary moment it was shown in the trailer. If this scene was kept in secret for the movie, it would have change my opinion a little bit. It was the best scary scene to show it in the trailer. I am rating it 7/10 overall as a movie and 9/10 as a conjuring universe story. We learned a lot of details about the characters in this prequel which it was a very addition to the whole universe. Worth watching? Yes. Especially if you are a fan of the Conjuring universe. Worth watching at the cinema? So So..."

As a matter of fact, there were many tense moments leading up to the real scare. The only thing I do agree with is that the Nun could use a little less growl and a little more \"ghostly\" element. And there were one or two scenes where the CGI was obvious. But otherwise, it had plenty of scary scenes, not just filled with uneventful moments. Contrary to what others are saying, Conjuring 1 and 2 had way more jump scares and loud obnoxious sounds, so I don't really know why people are comparing this to the number of jump scares that Conjuring 1 and 2 \"supposedly\" don't have. Overall, I liked this and thought that it was scary enough. I really wish that Hollywood gets that jump scares are so overdone and lame, and that they would start taking notes from The Ring and the first Michael Myers where he just stalks you and gets up from behind you while you're not looking, those types are things are way creepier."

Nine and ten stars should be reserved for the absolute best achievements in film. This film clearly doesn't deserve that either. Six seems about right at barely above average. Since the number on IMDB currently sits at 5.5, maybe the two extremist reviews do cancel either other out.\n\nThe Nun is no Conjuring/2 and here's a simple comparison: in The Nun, the nun opens her mouth wide a lot, blasts people against walls by doing so, and physically assaults people. That is supposed to be scary. In Conjuring 2, we see a dim image of the nun combined with camera motion and music...and it sends a chill of dread down the spine. That's the difference."

It heavily relies on jump scares while lacking a compelling plot and features subpar acting. Despite its potential, it squanders it.\n\nMy primary critique revolves around its adherence to fundamental principles. When dealing with a specific, reality-based theme, such as possessions and the Catholic Church, the film should maintain fidelity to those rules. Unfortunately, \"The Nun\" fails in this regard. It demonstrates a lack of understanding of the reality it portrays, depicting infestations, possessions, and exorcisms in a ridiculous way. Furthermore, it introduces fantasy relics and nonsensical combat scenes detracting from its credibility.\n\nBy haphazardly blending real themes with pure fantasy, the movie descends into absurdity. This lack of coherence undermines its potential impact.\n\nAdding insult to injury, the film claims to depict events occured in 1952, further highlighting its falling into the ridicule. This disparity emphasizes why \"The Exorcist\" remains a timeless classic: It adheres to the rules of its real-life theme, contributing to its enduring legacy.\n\nIf you're solely seeking jump scares, this movie may suffice. However, if you're in search of a well-crafted, coherent horror film with a substantial plot, don't waste your time on this disaster."

        "review_detailed_main": "Look, i loved The Conjuring, and maybe the scariest character was The demonic nun. It scared the crap out of me. So you can understand why i began watching The Nun with very high expectations. The Conjuring 1 and 2, and Annabelle Creation were soo atmospheric, so thrilling, scary, chilling and very very fun. This movie was the exact opposite.\n\nThere was not even one remotely scary scene in this film, it relied ONLY on jumpscares and they were predictable as hell. The titular nun from one of the scariest antagonists from the franchise became a joke. There were comical reliefs (we NEVER needed these in this franchise), absolutely ridiculous one-liners, jumpscare gallore and ZOMBIE NUNS!!! The film became ridiculous for me when the Father just got burried alive in a milisecond, and of course the French-man cutting the head of the zombie nun and go for the one-liner like the most stupid action movie ever. There was zeroo story, zeroo character development and zero scares. We never actually found out why in The demonic nun is the thing that it is, She had 1 milion manifestations and they were bad, just bad, the ending was the \"epic\" Hollywood ending that the major public wants.\n\nThe only good thing I can say about this film is that the CGI was kinda good and the music was chilling (but big part of it was just remade version of The Conjuring 2 soundtrack)\n\nThis is the fall of the franchise here. I don't know about the next additons to it, but compared to this Annabelle looked like The Exorcist.\n\nI'm mad, because i had high expectations, I never judge from the imdb score. But it is right, almost every time. It is a shame that a franchise that scared the angels out of me is now THIS thing. I'm a big horror fan and I love all kinds of horror, but this is agony."

        "review_detailed_main": "I missed The Nun as an entry to The Conjuring universe. Probably because this universe is one I don't care much about because I think most monster-in-the-house stories where the monster is a demon or some demon force miss the point most of the time. Remember, kiddos: it never is about the jumpscares, but rather the conflict between good and evil, or belief and misbelief.\n\nThe opening image was very effective. We have a glimpse of the power of the dark entity our heroes will have to endure. At this point, there should be no doubt: our antagonist is an entity of sorts.\n\nThe setup is quite weird. Father Burke, Sister Irene, and Frenchie are the classic demon-movie-hero template: Burke has a past, Irene debates fate by questioning it, and Frenchie is the full-on sinner. The main problem I have with the setup is that it basically gives our heroes the answers they need upfront. When they break into the second act, their sole goal is too simple.\n\nThe second act is just several jumpscares and minor expositions. Father Burke and Sister Irene are split most of the time, which I always find as dumb as possible considering that they already know that foul play is in place, resulting in them endangering themselves over and over again. And I guess this is the pet peeve I have with most demonic entity movies: it's usually just a number of jumpscares until they come up with the ultimate plan which is usually exorcism or sealing some portal.\n\nFather Burke seems shallow, too shallow. When we understand his side story, we don't feel it is too much of a struggle, either because the movie does not explore it in a good way or because Father is sort of a plank.\n\nSister Irene is definitely the main protagonist. She is the pure young soul in the middle of chaos. However, even she does not get justice: it seems she questions the Church, or that she does not know if she wants to take her vows, but that is not explored until the end. Also, considering what broke them into the second act, I would say that I would be taking my vows on short notice!\n\nFrenchie is just a side dude; a helper at convenient times.\n\nThis is a good time to bash the antagonist. After confirmation of what they are dealing with, the whole The Nun stuff sounds pretty stupid; pure exploitation.\n\nWell, have at it, our Act 3 break is one of the previous choices for ultimate plans. It didn't seem like much of a dilemma for them, and that annoys me. Considering their odds, and every event so far, I'd bail out for sure because they are definitely not prepared. Live today to fight tomorrow. But then the movie would have been worse, so of course, they want to do one suicidal attempt.\n\nThe climax starts great. As they progress, things improve great, until the point I was really enjoying the incidents, true Silent Hill faction up to one point. Then, things go downhill. Out Nun entity seems so out of focus with her goals that I don't know what was its true purpose. Her vanquishing is also one non-sense scene, funny at least.\n\nTo wrap up, we get the one tie-in to the Conjuring universe to remind us that this is a movie from the Conjuring universe. A good tie-in, but, by this point, I was sore.\n\nI would only recommend this movie if you want to get jumpscared over and over again. If you are searching for a story, then skip The Nun."

It tells the story of a priest and a novice who are sent to Romania (in 1952), by the Vatican, to investigate the apparent suicide of a nun there, and they encounter a powerful demonic force. The movie was directed by rookie filmmaker Corin Hardy, and it was written by Gary Dauberman and series creator James Wan. The film stars Demian Bichir, Taissa Farmiga (the sister of 'CONJURING' star Vera Farmiga) and Jonas Bloquet. It's expected to be another huge hit at the Box Office (like the others in the series), but this one has gotten mostly negative reviews from critics so far. I really enjoyed parts of it, but I was also really bored for large chunks of it as well, but that can be said for the other installments in the series too (except for the original). I also found the trailer for the movie to be a lot creepier and more disturbing than the actual film. The film is actually kind of fun, more so than scary, despite it being pretty dull at times as well."

They used a lot of panning shots which give the movie almost an artistic touch. And it really works in this film! Also there where many things happening in the background voor the viewers which enhance the viewing experience!\n\nThe story itself is a bit broken in my opinion. The reason for that could be that I haven't seen any of the other movies but it really felt like two movies in one. The first half feels a bit sluggish with only a few jumpscares to make the movie a bit more interesting. The second half is strangely enough really good! It has a few interesting twists that I didn't expect. I can even see that they got some inspiration from movies like Evil Dead and Silent Hill.\n\nOverall this is probably a movie for fans of the franchise which I am not. But I had a fun hour and a half and it is well worth your money!"

        "review_detailed_main": "It's absolutely disrespectful to mention \"The Conjuring\" and this joke of a film in the same sentence, let alone put \"The Conjuring\" on the same poster. This film contained none of the theatrical elements that makes \"The Conjuring\" as good as it is. This film is simply a hollowed-out cash grab. The director is simply taking advantage of actual horror fans.\n\nFirstly, the acting and character development were lackluster at best. There were actually times in the film where I was rooting for main characters to die. This is okay in campy/slasher horror movies where the majority of the characters are meaningless and much more focus is given to developing the monster/villain. However, in this film you learn very little about The Nun and her motivations while learning very little about the protagonists as well!\n\nSecondly, the use of \"jump-scares\" is extensive. So much so that I stopped being scared because I expected them so consistently. Cheap effects and unlikable characters made these scares even more underwhelming. I felt that the film was pandering to the \"scared teenage girl\" demographic and true horror fans are starved of actual tension and fear.\n\nThirdly, the setting for the film is unrepeatable. How many nuns and monks are going to be watching this film? How many people have spent months living in a monastery? Fear comes from relatable and \"safe\" places becoming dangerous. Since I will likely never step foot in a monastery then it looks like I wont have to worry about any demon nuns coming to get me.\n\nOverall, this movie was a great disappointment. The director pales in comparison to James Wan and it seems he learned nothing from the previous films in the \"Conjuring Universe\". I slept like a baby after watching this hardly impressionable film and I will have to go watch a truly great horror film to make up for the time I wasted watching this tragic assembly."

This movie is definitely weak, it isn't a great movie. The acting is alright, the reason on why I think it is better than Annabelle is that it isn't nearly as boring as Annabelle. Annabelle was a slog to get through, this not so much. It isn't anywhere near as good conjuring 1, 2 or Annabelle creation, but it also isn't anywhere near as bad as Annabelle. The nun can't carry a movie, she was scary in the conjuring cause she was just pulling the strings and just spooking people. You can't have a movie where the main antagonist is legit doing nothing for 2/3s of the movie. I know it sounds like I'm being harsh, but overall I think I liked the movie, I had lowered expectations since it is supposed to be the worst conjuring, but it simply isn't that. It's the second worst. I think the worst part of this movie is that they take what was a spooky character from conjuring 2 and somehow make her not scary. Idk how they did that but they did. I love how bonkers the story is, I'm a sucker for these crazy stupid stories, I loved A Cure For Wellness for how it goes insane with its story. If you are expecting a scary movie, don't it isn't scary, but if you want a dumb fun movie that is so bonkers it's funny with some great locations and set designs along with a few good performances then watch this. I'll give it a 6/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Nun is directed by Corin Hardy and is the new addition to The Conjuring Universe. It stars Taissa Farmiga, Demi\u00e1n Bichir, and Jonas Bloquet and tells the story of Father Burke (Bichir) and a nun in her novitiate (Farmiga) as they uncover a secret involving a demon nun lurking around a monastery in 1952 Romania.\n\nAs unsettling the title character is as she was introduced in The Conjuring 2, the film doesn't offer much to keep us on the edge of the seats. The over-reliance on jumpscares and a weak narrative really bogged down the film's potential. Inconsistent logic is present throughout while following almost every horror trope we've come to know and expect.\n\nThe use of jumpscares may be startling for some but it's so reliant on it you forget you're watching a movie and not a bunch of 20 second horror videos in YouTube. Most jumpscares used involve a build up, such as a pan, and startling sound effects rape your ears along with the supposed \"scare\" showing on the screen. The plot is also very predictable I don't even have to tell anymore. There's also an exposition scene explaining how the horrors began for the sake of the plot. It's exactly how you think it will be. Just with some surprising scenes.\n\nSpeaking of surprising scenes, there are some that actually work. The cinematography is good, creepy atmosphere done right, and the performances are really praiseworthy. With those positives, certain scenes in the film tend to give you goosebumps.\n\nThe cast performed well but the characters aren't really developed enough. The most compelling character present is sister Irene, played by Farmiga. There's also one character who's only there for comic relief. Sure, he helps drive the plot along but that's only it. His character is so flat he's mostly just there for humor, which at times work. Father Burke is also an interesting character. We learn about his past through exposition and we actually tend to care about him.\n\nThis film is just bad and an unworthy entry to the franchise. It had so much potential but got severely wasted due to reliance of jumpscares and poor writing. The title character wasn't even intimidating, and that's saying something.\n\n-Yman Dayawon"

The Nun In Another Hand set before Annabelle and Conjuring this was one hell of ride of Scary and Darkness full of it i like it that way i thought characters in this movie were better, i thought it's Slaright Forward Movie not a 2 hour long just to know what is going to happen just Slaright Forward Simple Plot THAT'S IT. i mean come people how much do you want more of story to be 2 hour long plot people say oh it's almost like they just threw it Together in 5 Minutes of Back Up Story of Nun ? i am like how much their is to Know More About Nun ? She Is just Demon Turned Possessed Into Demon as a Evil Nun ? i mean how much is their to know about ? it's good that they did it slaright forward or else it's boring as hell, witch they want to do Nun 2 to show Valak back story a lot more like Annabelle Creation. I Thought this was one of true horror movies then to Winchester or Slender Man, this is better horror movie. story follows Father Burke (Demi\u00e1n Bichir) know for Machete Kills, Hateful Eight, Savages. A priest with a haunted past and a novice on the threshold of her final vows are sent by the Vatican to investigate the death of a young nun in Romania I Thought Priest is a great character in movie he is in it the all time. Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga) know for The Final Girls. Burke and Sister Irene were sent to Investigate and go travel to Romania and meet with Frenchie (Jonas Bloquet) know for 3 Days To Kill. Frenchie who was French and Canadian saw Nun Hanged her self, he saw it happen, they went in to Church where all Nuns Live In. they just investigate about Place, Now they show Nun their and their but it builds Suspense but it doesn't take awhile to get to Jump Scenes this movie is very scary when i say Scary it's full on Darkness and Haunting and Terrifying\n\nThe camera work is great and with very little use of CGI, it makes the film feel even more dark. One things for sure, the nun will give you nightmares, full of it Don't convince your self that you won't get scared or that you won't like it. YOU WILL, after that. This movie has excellent sound effects, great soundtracks, good sensation and a lot of scare. i really enjoyed Conjuring 1&2 great movies first Annabelle is good and Annabelle Creation i didn't like, but for those and horror fans this is one hell of ride of darkness for you to watch it's worth it for money and ticket it's worth it, those days with Horror movies aren't good as any more i hated Slender Man or Ouija 1 & 2 witch i had no idea why they got a franchise, Gallows Hated, i loved It Follows but when it comes to the conjuring films they had something special here for Conjuring Universe. It's Not Based true events, but they have that psychological element that makes a film truly frightening, it's just Non Fiction Connected with Conjuring Movies. The acting seriously makes the film believable which adds to the frightening scene where you're wanting to hide, your heart is pounding like you just ran a marathon, this is how the film makes you feel with unexpected jump moments that make you jump out of your skin. i thought i loved some of ideas of movie and there's no cheap jump scenes i am tried of Jump scenes but movie does have it but it doesn't make me to hate movie, their is scenes that are scary witch it doesn't not all of them involve jump scenes. i thought their are scenes of movie that little look like to Winchester witch movie i hated so badly this is much more scarier then to Winchester a lot more. i give this 7.10 it's good movie this kicks Devil Inside in Inside right in Butt, Corin Hardy is new director the Nun he made was good he made only one movie this is his second movie he did a great job as a beginner director whatever he is but he done a good job of this project, i mean this is one of better horror enjoyable movie right edge of your seat the most terrifying movie of all time, and it's worth it."

I spent a pound ($1.29) on this film and found it in the charity shop the opening week it came out on dvd and wondered why it was in there so soon. Well this is why. The films plot is complete garbage in a bin bag that keeps spilling out more rubbish to keep you invested, some of these sub plots are so disposable you don't even bother to pick up on them. All the Nun does is stand there like a stature whilst her wwe entrance theme plays. Funnily enough in the conjuring two I found her pretty scary because she actually did stuff, now I don't and I'm also immune to jump scares. Overall this film was created for twelve year old boys to find scary but they couldn't even go and see it. Don't watch this film it's amusingly bad, go watch the original conjuring movies and don't watch any and I mean any of the spin offs.

I just cannot give it anything over 1.\n\nSo just to quickly review:\n\nThe plot - what plot? Was there a plot? Was there a story that needed to be told? The best part of the whole movie was the ending scene where they showed Ed and Lorraine talking about this curse, because it reminded me of what a decent movie actually looks like. And also it made me realize that The nun just did not need to happen at all, there was absolutely no value in this film, no new and interesting information etc. Even the nun itself wasn\u00b4t scary anymore, it roared for pete\u00b4s sake.\n\nThe actors - uhm yeah...maybe sister Irene was kind of okay. But as I said - the nun itself was absolutely horrible and not in a good way. I mean I laughed when there were close-ups of the nun. I think you\u00b4re not supposed to laugh during a horror movie unless they intended to make a joke.\n\nAnd the scare-factor? Well unless you are totally new to horror movies then I just can\u00b4t see how you could\u00b4ve been scared of anything they showed in that movie. To me most of the \"scary\" parts were laughable, unlogical and very poorly executed. I am truly sorry I ever saw this movie at all, it ruined the \"nun-factor\"."

A decent horror flick in keeping with the series (the feel of it). I am not sure what people were expecting going into it, perhaps an exact replica of previous conjuring movies? If you went in with the notion of watching it for what it is, it is an experience, a worthwhile one. In terms of production and acting and just the eeriness it is all quality no doubt. Its not just a jump scare as others have said. There is just enough of a story as a backbone. just enough that's weird and freaky and haunting to feel like a new experience and keep u watching to the end. Honestly I didn find the nun character at all of a scary one in previous conjuring movies - this shed some more light , well rather darkness on the character created and adds more heft to the demonic presence- and demonic it is. Definitely an enjoyable experience and great production and acting. lead character was immense in what she brought.\n\nWatch it, better than many of the \"horrors\" over the last couple of years."

With a plot that made as much sense as a see-through burka The Nun will leave you questioning everything but the film itself.

It's fun, has a story worthy of attention, and some good effects and scares. It's nothing outright special now is it anything original nor groundbreaking. It's a good popcorn horror. But it plays on the whole Catholic vs Evil storyline, which most people with a Christian background most certainly would scoff at, since if it was anything that horror movies have taught us, is that the Catholic authority is almost useless against the forces of evil (or that Catholic authority is the ONLY force against evil, which to anyone outside the Catholic faith probably thinks is false), thus already setting a pre-determined assumption of the outcome of the plot. But, nonetheless, on a bored night when nothing else else in the streamable selection of online features looks appeasing, this movie should nonetheless satisfy a natural curiosity of spooks and thrills. Just once again, abstain from thinking authoritative figures within the Catholic church are the only source against such evil."

Or maybe they spent all that money on the utterly terrible CGI but if that's the case a lot of people need to get fired. Oh no I remember (how could I forgot) almost the entirety of that money must have been spent on the non-stop, shameless shove it down your throat marketing for the film. But fair play as that marketing scam is what made me part with my hard-earned money, and I can only assume it duped many others as the film went on to gross $365 Million.\n\nThis brings me on to my main point yes, the nun it terrible in almost every conceivable way the acting is modern and honestly feels like it's out of a local drama school. The CGI nun is so laughable it honestly makes you laugh (there was one scene where I could hear the whole cinema laugh towards the end) and every 10 minutes the music cuts out until we hear a loud noise... how scary. But this is a industry wide problem with 90% of mainstream horror films falling into the same trap now days hence my title.\n\nThe Nun 2/10."

But if, and ONLY if, it was done correctly. There in lies the rub...\n\nBASIC PLOT: A young nun apparently takes her own life at a remote convent situated in an ancient castle in Romania. A priest with a dark past and a young girl on the verge of taking her vows to becoming a nun, travel to the site to investigate and find out that more than a few things go bump in the night at this castle.\n\nREVIEW: I can only be honest and speak from a personal standpoint... this film just didn't pan out. At all. I always tend to come back to a similar standpoint when reviewing movies, especially horror and that is that you HAVE to get people caring about the characters early on. You have to achieve this through a strong script so that audiences can identify with the characters, emotionally invest in them and THEN they are worried for the characters in the film and the fear & tension can start. This film for me just did not make me want to really connect with anyone. I just didn't really care. So after a loose start to the film more airing on the side of comedy than horror, by the time the characters reached the castle, I just didn't have a sense of dread for them going inside. Once they reach Romania, the script just goes completely off the reservation and reads more like a child writing a scary story more than a horror movie from the same universe that brought us the Conjuring tales. The plot holes start and just do not let up. I found myself shaking my head and laughing at numerous points which let's be honest, is just not really the emotions you want to be feeling during a horror film. Positives, they were scare but there were a few. On the technical side of things the film was very polished and slick. It did look gorgeous at points, some wonderful shots of the old castle, very Transylvania like. The sound and music also preyed upon certain scenes nicely, building crescendos and unnerving sound effects working in harmony with the visuals, everything employed that was successfully learnt in the Conjuring series. Acting was lacklustre overall, although I almost don't blame the actors themselves as with a script and dialogue as it was, it must've been very hard to find any true depth to these characters and get in the role. The only mention I really feel I could give is to Taissa Farmiga yerself, who does do well and keeps up her characters conflicted and unnerved persona decently throughout.\n\nVERDICT: For me, a colossal disappointment and failed attempt on what could have been a interesting and terrifying offshoot from the franchise. The fear and scares just never materialised and when they did, they somehow felt more comical and over the top than true horror. I feel this movie got green lit before any story was penned and the entire project was built around money, money going into the film with no real direction or strong plot with the hopes of a lot of money to be made at the box office simply because it rides on the coat tails of its successful Conjuring predecessors. A sad miss."

The writing lazily tries to tie this in with the prior mentioned films with performances that are as stale as a year-old communion Eucharist. Filled with so-so jump scares, some raspy throated nuns and a few appearances of namesake demon are you really get with the price of admission. Not much really makes sense, there's no grand Exorcist III atmospherics and the end...well, it comes and goes and you're left better off, again, sticking to the first two conjuring films. Pass."

        "review_detailed_main": "As the universe of Ed and Lorraine Warren continues to expand, fans are taken to the forests of Romania for additional backstory on familiar characters - this time it's that creepy ghostly demonic nun.\n\nIt's mid-20th century, and Father Burke (Demian Bichir) travels with a pre-vows nun candidate named Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga) to investigate an apparent suicide by another nun. Of course, we soon find out there's a lot more going on within the abbey. But aside from a few frightening moments, 'The Nun' is a lot more bark than it is bite.\n\nThere isn't really a whole lot of original content in 'The Nun,' instead director Corin Hardy and writer James Wan rely on old, tired scares rather than trying to recapture the magic of the original 'Conjuring.' Farmiga does well, no doubt, but Bichir comes off as very forced. Meanwhile, country boy \"Frenchie\" (Jonas Bioquet) is intended as comic relief, but he ends up sticking out like a sore thumb among the darkness surrounding him and his comrades. And while you really can't tell it's her, Bonnie Aarons does a respectable job as the title character - she is truly terrifying.\n\nAfter a somewhat boring but mildly scary first two-thirds, the final act really devolves into chaos, but not in a good way. And despite a pretty clever twist in the final minute, 'The Nun' ends up feeling like a film that was created out of necessity rather than because it should be made.\n\nBut of course, a sequel has already been announced. Hopefully the follow up to 'The Nun' isn't just more of the same."

So we put it on and watched it. Again - as it turned out we had watched it all. It was just THAT inconsequential.\n\nAs many others have said, the story is not very original, quite linear.

I got surprised many times, some jump scares, and let's get over what was good and bad about this movie, the characters and overall thoughts. The Nun offers us many jump scares, sometimes too much, some were very predictable, some were not, and I think jump scares were like a big ingredient in this movie. The atmosphere and suspense was good, but many confusing and unnecessary elements that weren't needed in the movie, what was a negative side. I think the scenography and the acting was good, but not stunning, and well told story. They explained everything good, but this movie feeled rushed. Very rushed. The first 20 minutes went too fast, and could have slower motion, maybe put more time in the scenes. Sister Irene was a good character in the movie. She showed us that she was loyal to her religion, she was very religious, just like the whole movie, this was a very typical chatolic-christian horror movie. But anyway, besides Sister Irene and her loyality, The Demon, Valak, was well introduced too. Valak appeared in several formes, what was sometimes cool, but very weird, becaue we couldn't really find out how Valak really looked like, besides the last act of the movie. I think showing something in different versions can be good, but in horror movies, I think a monster/demon should be showed in one way. Overall, The Nun was entertaining, sometimes not so interesting, got some good elements of horror, especially jump scares, could fix some small parts, Valak could be better presented. This is not the best horror movie I have ever seen, but it was completely ok."

All they ever do is screech and howl. I want brutal aggression, arrogance, derision, cold, calculating intellect, sadism, and unbridled hate.

Sure, the story is not great but the atmosphere is rich in gothic detail and the camera work gave me the chills that the old maestro Bava used to deliver. Combine that with charming lead performances and a lean/mean runtime and you've got yourself a solid modern horror movies.\n\nFolks are way too hard on this movie and I've got some sneaking suspicions that it's because it's a period film with religious elements and we live in uneducated and godless times."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Nun is seriously dumb with major leaps in logic and it's light on genuine scares but it's also rich in atmosphere whilst managing to successfully morph into an action movie for the third act equipped with heroic entrances and cheesy one liners. Plus at just over 90 minutes it definitely doesn't overstay its welcome.\n\nThe core trio are a likeable set of characters to root for. Taissa Farmiga brings a lot of conviction, Demi\u00e1n Bichir really gets put through the wringer with palpable exhaustion and Jonas Bloquet is a wisely sparingly used comic relief. Bonnie Aarons really makes the role her own, there's more of her in this performance as she clearly revels in being this evil.\n\nCorin Hardy's direction is really good, making up for a lack of overall scares with a few solid jump scares and a consistently strong atmosphere. The music by Abel Korzeniowski mostly just reuses what's come before but those pieces remain really unnerving and are probably the scariest parts of the film."

Transmits idea of lack of ideas and criativity on that matter. Too long and after 60min is a real fight to keep it watching. I quit around 1h:12 mark, I was not interested to see the end anymore. Father role-very good acting The horse guy-average acting but not funnybwhen supposed to be. The young nun-im sorry Taissa but het perfomance was too cliche, over melodramatic and not convincing. But she tried her best and that was very noticed. Maybe for other roles a good actress or only need to gain more maturity and some more years of experience."

If you grew up in the church like I did I think you'll fin it good in a spooky way."

The movie relies on loud jump scares with a terrifying nun. Not much else is that scary. It doesn't have the same scares as the other conjuring films, but I would watch it again. I don't get the 2 or 3 star ratings, it deserves at least a 6!\n\nPROS: Creepy nun, decent jump scares, average acting, good camera work and nice special effects.\n\nCONS: Thin plot, mediocre movie compared to other the conjuring films\n\nI would suggest this movie, but it's not something I could re-watch a lot of times like the other films from the conjuring franchise."

It didn't make me feel anything for any of the characters. Everyone in this movie acted ridiculously stupid and this is why horror movies are just poop today. I can't believe that you the director believed people can be that stupid in real life. When you hear strange noises in a chapel that is locked off, why the hell do you think that's a great idea and investigate? Or splitting up is a better way of trying to find the answers you're looking for? This boring effect towards horror movie is played out. Come up with better ideas . Common sense people would not act this way. And you think I'm going to believe that this movie supposed to be scary. Ha!"
