        "review_detailed_main": "There are people out there who will greenlight anything! That is the only explanation I can offer as to why the House of the Dead movie exists. And that's only scary part to the whole movie. It's so bad you'll go off movies forever. I seriously wanted to switch this off and turn the TV over to the Paint Drying channel but I was bound by my word to suffer the whole thing. I don't know why I do these bad things to myself.\n\nAs if it matters, here's the basic jist of the 'story'. A group of twenty-somethings are so desperate to go out to some island in the Pacific Northwest (Canada actually, because it's cheap) for the 'Rave of the Century' (which consists of about 8 people and un-raving music) that they pay some craggy old fisherman $1000 to take them there after they miss the main ferry. That's gotta be some rave to be worth all that dough! The fisherman warns them that the island is also known as the Island of the Dead (hang on-I thought this was HOUSE of the Dead?) and that they are all doomed yadda yadda yadda.\n\nFirst faults here. Why would a tiny little rave (of the Century my foot!) be held on some remote island? Why would anyone willingly pay loads of money to get it? Why pay even more to the craggy old fisherman to take them back when they could just come back with the others?\n\nOnce they arrive they discover that the rave (which consists of about 2 tents, a small stage and a port-a-john) has been smashed, there's blood everywhere and no one is around. What would any rationally thinking person do? Run for their lives of course. But no, these clueless, obviously blind people decide to go look for them. Soon enough they discover an old ramshackle house that's 50 times as big on the inside as it is on the outside. Another half hour of stumbling around in the forest follows, as an excuse to kill of some of the lesser characters, and after much tedium they arrive back at the house again. The characters, like the movie, go nowhere.\n\nJammed into this ghastly disaster is a superabundance of gibberish dialogue, heinous acting, mumbo-jumbo exposition and zillions of clips from the once-popular arcade game of the same name. Why this was universally accepted as a good idea with the filmmakers I'll never know. The clips have no reference to any of the scenes and only degrade this trash even further, if that is at all possible.\n\nIt has nothing to do with the game save for some cheap, throwaway line at the end. It makes Resident Evil look like cinematic glory. Hell, even the Double Dragon movie seems multi-Oscar worthy in comparison to this junk. The only one who comes out of this with his dignity still intact is Jurgen Prochnow. He could have just taken his money and ran but he tries his best with the awful script and brings a tiny bit of pathos to his character. The rest of the cast suck I'm afraid. The characters are idiots and deserve to die.\n\nPlus, if you cut out the swearing and pointless nudity, I see no reason why this film cannot be shown on Saturday morning TV. It's not frightening in the slightest. Pirates of the Caribbean is more scary than the skeletal bad guys in this film. And where did all those bad guys come from anyway? There were only a few people on the island to begin with. I guess this justifies the reason they chose to reuse footage over and over. I kid you not, you'll see the same zombie die a dozen times.\n\nWho's ultimately to blame for that scandalous waste of celluloid? None other than director Uwe Boll. His control over the movie is non-existent. You can clearly the see actors have no idea what they should be doing and that the zombies aren't really taking it all seriously. The actors seem like they're reading off cue cards as they constantly pause in the middle of long sentences and carry on talking as soon as they see the next card. It all feels very unnatural.\n\nPlus the film is shot like a two-part mini-series. I have indeed seen better TV productions. And don't get me started on the editing. The film is an incoherent babble with thousands upon thousands of pointless shots and dozens of meaningless camera pans. No real skill or talent was put into making this at all. It truly baffles and boggles the mind how movies this unfathomably bad can get made and George A. Romero can't even get anyone to take his calls. House of the Dead makes some idiotic reference to Romero in a lazy attempt to be 'post-modern' but it only irritates that they think THIS is in the same league as a REAL zombie movie.\n\nFor what it's worth, the 1.85:1 anamorphic picture looks great and the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is clean but very unimpressive and only serves to pronounce the heavily over-used ADR even more. The DVD comes with extras but why torture yourself. Isn't this review warning enough? Stay away! You are all doomed I tell you! Doomed! Doomed!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "There are some movies you just know they are going to be bad from frame one. Even if you were totally oblivious of Ed Wood's work, one look at that commentator from \"Plan 9 from outer space\" and you just KNOW you are not gonna see the next cinematic masterpiece. Just like that, when I saw the first shot of Uwe Bolls masterpiece \"House of Dead\", with that guy sitting at the front of the house starting his introduction while trying desperately to sound like he just arrived from Sin City, I knew I'm in for a helluva ride.\n\nSo, the movie starts like this - first the lead character says that everybody else is going to die. You know, to keep you wandering. Then he starts introducing the rest of the characters with lines like \"Karma..thinks she's Foxy Brown\" or \"Alicia..my ex.. we broke up recently.. I had to study and she had to fence\". No, I'm not kidding.\n\nAnyway, this bunch of 20-somethings who couldn't act their way out of a wet paper-bag are going to the \"Rave of the century\", rave in question being a few tents, a port-a-potty and a shoddy stage located on small island in the middle of the Pacific. Our gang missed the ferry, but thankfully will find a way to get there, the way being a fisher-boat ran by Kirk (Cpt Kirk? Get it? Man, whoever wrote this script is a genius) and his sidekick who is a bastard child of Simpsons' Cpt McAllister and that hook killer who knows what you did last summer.\n\nTo make the long story short, the gang gets to the island, finds nobody there except some bloody T-shirts and then decide to run the hell away from there. No wait, they do not, they actually get all happy and like cos there's free booze.\n\nWith that scene the movie hits rock bottom and then against all odds proceeds to go further downhill. Some guys in rubber suits start running around, there is some screaming and shooting, our gang goes to some house to meet some other gang, they go out of the house, meet Cpt Kirk and some police woman (who between them have about 500 pounds of weapons) and then decide to go back to the house. Somewhere along the line they transform into a S.W.A.T. team, enter the Matrix, the rubber-suit guys start multiplying like bacteria and I start to cry because I actually paid to see this. To add insult to the injury, every few minutes there are shots from the video game this crap is based on and there is a cute game-over cut-scene for a few characters when they die.\n\nI seriously hate this movie. It doesn't even fit in that famed \"So bad it's good\" category. It's just plain bad. The script is bad, the zombies are awful, there is no tension, lines are bad, actors are bad.. the list just goes on.\n\nYou will probably want to see this movie just because of its reputation of being awful. Don't. There are bad movies that deserve to be watched. This is not one of them."

So when I had heard every single critic railing this movie I was still optimistic. I mean, critics hated Resident Evil, and while it may not be a particularly great film, I enjoyed it if not for the fact that it was just a fun zombie shoot-em up with a half decent plot. This however, is pure crap. Terrible dialogue, half-assed plot, and video game scenes inserted into the film. Who in their right mind thought that was a good idea. The only thing about this movie (I use the term loosely) that I enjoyed was Jurgen Prochnow as Captain Kirk (Ugh). While his name throws originality out the window, you can see in his performance that he knows he's in a god awful film and he might as well make the best of it. Everyone else acts as if they're doing Shakespeare. And very badly I might add. Basically the only reason anyone should see this monstrosity is if you a.) Are a huge zombie buff and must see every zombie flick made or b.) Like to play MST3K, the home game. See it with friends and be prepared for tons of unintentional laughs."

The actors appear to be reading off cue cards and do the dumbest things. Such as being chased by dead people but yet wanting to go out and look for their friends. Also the zombies were terrible, no where near as fun as any of Romero's work, who gets s plug in the movie. And the dumbest part of all was they kept showing flashes of the video game in the action sequences. Like we don't get the video game is about shooting zombies. Also, all the 20 somethings some how know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even aiming the gun. And the way the people die is so stupid. It's like they run out of ammo so stand around waiting to be jumped on. And when cornered in front of the house they run out of ammo instead of shooting the door open, So dumb.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: If any of these actors appear in another film, then they've been blessed with a second chance. Definitely the worst film I've seen in years. A B-movie on cinemax is better."

        "review_detailed_main": "Laid up and drugged out, as a kidney stone wended its merry way through my scarred urinary tract, with absolutely nothing better to do than let the painkillers swoon me into semi-oblivion, I happened to catch this movie on cable. I wouldn't want anyone to think that I paid to view it in a cinema, or rented it, or \u0096 heaven forfend! \u0096 that I watched it STRAIGHT.\n\nHaving played this sensationally gruesome video game and avidly trod the doomed rooms and dread passageways of The House, battling Chariot (Type 27), The Hanged Man (Type 041), and other impossible sentinels, my curiosity was piqued as to how the game would transfer to the movie screen.\n\nIt doesn't.\n\nThe banal plot revolves around a group of \"crazy kids\" \u0096 a la Scooby Doo \u0096 attending a remote island for a world-shaking \"rave\" \u0096 whatever that is. (You kids today with your hula-hoops and your mini-skirts and your Pat Boone\u0085) After bribing a boat captain thousands in cash to ferry them there (a stupidity which begs its own network of rhetoric), they find the \"rave\" deserted.\n\nPassing mention is made of a \"house\" \u0096 presumably the titular House Of The Dead \u0096 but most of the action takes place on fake outdoor sets and other locales divorced from any semblance of haunted residence.\n\nA fallen video camera acts as flashback filler, showing the island in the throes of a \u0096 party?! Is that it? Oh, so this \"rave\" thingy is just a \"party\"? In the grand tradition of re-euphemizing \"used cars\" as \"pre-owned\", or \"shell shock\" as \"post-traumatic stress disorder\", the word \"party\" is now too square for you drug-addled, silicone-implanted, metrosexual jagoffs?\n\nIt is learned that the party was broken up by rampaging zombies. Intelligent thought stops here\u0085\n\nI don't think the pinheads who call themselves screenwriters and directors understand the mythos behind zombie re-animation. Zombies can't die \u0096 they're already UN-DEAD. They do not bleed, they know no pain. Unless their bodies are completely annihilated, they will continue being animated. At least, that's what my Jamaican witch priestess tells me.\n\nWhich means that a .45 shot into their \"hearts\" is not going to stop them, nor will a machete to the torso. And a shotgun blast to the chest will certainly NOT bring forth gouts of blood. At least in the video game's logic, the shooter pumps so many rounds into each monster that it is completely decimated, leaving a fetid mush that cannot re-animate itself.\n\nYet each actor-slash-model gets their Matrix-circular-camera moment, slaying zombies on all fronts with single bullets and karate chops to the sternum. Seriously, these zombies are more ineffective than the Stormtroopers from \"Return Of The Jedi\", who get knocked out when Ewoks trip them.\n\nI suppose the film's writer, Mark Altman, having penned the not-too-shabby \"Free Enterprise\", felt compelled to insert a Captain Kirk reference, in the character of Jurgen Prochnow, who must have needed milk money desperately to have succumbed to appearing in this aromatic dung-swill. There is also a reference to Prochnow's primo role in the magnificent \"Das Boot\", when one of the untrained B-actors mentions that he \"looks like a U-Boat Captain\". \". I wonder how many of this movie's target audience of square-eyed swine picked up on ANY of the snide references to other films, as when Prochnow declares, \"Say hello to my little friend\", presaging his machine gun moment.\n\nAimed at a demographic who have not the wherewithal to comprehend the Sisyphean futility of the video-game concept (i.e. the game ends when you die \u0096 you cannot win), this is merely a slasher film for the mindless and mindless at heart. Accordingly, everyone dies in due course, except for a heterosexual pair of Attractive White People.\n\nA better use for this film's scant yet misused budget might have been to send the cast through Acting School, although Ona Grauer's left breast did a good job, as did her right breast \u0096 and those slomo running scenes: priceless! I especially liked the final scene with Ona trying to act like she's been stabbed, but looking like she's just eaten ice cream too fast.\n\nAttempting to do something more constructive with my time, I pulled out my Digitally-Restored, 35th Anniversary, Special Edition, Widescreen Anamorphic DVD of \"Manos: The Hands Of Fate.\" Ah, yes! \u0096 the drugs were suitably brain-numbing - now HERE was some quality film-making\u0085\n\n(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)"

        "review_title": "Wow.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Okay, so I'm not a big video game buff, but was the game House of the Dead really famous enough to make a movie from? Sure, they went as far as to actually put in quick video game clips throughout the movie, as though justifying any particular scene of violence, but there are dozens and dozens of games that look exactly the same, with the hand in the bottom on the screen, supposedly your own, holding whatever weapon and goo-ing all kinds of aliens or walking dead or snipers or whatever the case may be.\n\nIt's an interesting premise in House of the Dead, with a lot of college kids (LOADED college kids, as it were, kids who are able to pay some fisherman something like $1,500 just for a ride after they miss their boat) trying to get out to this island for what is supposed to be the rave of the year. The first thing that comes to mind about House of the Dead after watching it is that it has become increasingly clear that modern horror movies have become nothing more than an exercise in coming up with creative ways to get a lot of scantily clad teenagers into exactly the same situations. At least in this case, the fact that they were on their way to a rave excuses the way the girls are dressed. They look badly out of place running around the woods in cute little halter-tops, but at least they THOUGHT they were dressed for the occasion.\n\nClint Howard, tellingly the most interesting character in the film by far, delivers an absolutely awful performance, the greatness of which overshadows every other actor in the movie. I can't stand it when well-known actors change their accents in movies, it is so rarely effective, and Howard here shows that it is equally flat to have an well-known actor pretend that he's this hardened fisherman with a raspy voice from years of breathing salty air. He didn't even rasp well. It sounded like he was eating a cinnamon roll before shooting and accidentally inhaled some powdered sugar or something. Real tough there, Clint! I expected more from him, but then again, he did agree to a part in this mess.\n\nOnce we get to the island, the movie temporarily turns into any one of the Friday the 13th movies that took place at Camp Crystal Lake. Lots of teenagers played by actors who were way too old for their parts getting naked and then killed. The nudity was impressive, I guess, but let's consider something for a minute. These kids pay almost two grand to get out to this island to go to the Rave Of The Year, find NO ONE, and say, well, who wants a beer! Even the guy who pulled that stack of hundreds out of his wallet to get them all over there didn't think anything of it that they found a full bar and not a single solitary person in sight. Here you have the input from director Uwe Boll - There's alcohol! They won't notice that the party they came for consists of no one but themselves!\n\nSo not only do they start drinking, not minding the fact that the whole party seems to have vacated the island, but when one of the girls goes off into the dark woods to find out where everyone is (dragging one other girl and one of the guys reluctantly along), the guy and the girl who stay behind to get smashed decide that it would be a great idea to strip down for a quickie now that they're alone. It's like they expected to find the island empty, and now that they rest of the people that they came over with were gone for a little while, they would have some privacy since there's no one else around. Brilliant!\n\nNow for the things that everyone hated, judging by the reviews that I've read about the movie. Yes, intersplicing shots from the video game into the movie, mostly in order to show that, yes, the movie was being faithful to/directly copying the video game. Sure, it was a stupid idea. I can't imagine who thought up that little nugget, but worse than that is the Matrix-style bullet time scenes that were thrown in over and over and over and over. After the first time (at which point I found it pretentious and cheesy for a movie like this to have a shot like that as though it was something original) it is noticeable more for the technique of the shot itself rather than any dramatic meaning or creation of any kind of tension for the film.\n\nOne of the things that makes a zombie film scary and gets you on the edge of your seat is to have them slowly but relentlessly coming after the living humans, who are much faster but getting tired, running out of places to run, and with a terrifying shortage of things with which to fight the zombies off with. The first two are done right in the movie, the kids are terrified and don't have a lot of places to run since they're on an island, but since they caught a ride over with a smuggler, they find themselves heavily armed. And I mean that very strongly. I mean, these people have everything from machine guns to hand grenades, which removes most of the tension of the impending walking dead.\n\nThen you have what I call the techno-slasher scene. Since the rave never happened, and I guess since Uwe Boll thought people were going to be disappointed at not hearing any techno music in the movie, there's one scene right in the middle where all the humans are fighting off the living dead, and amazingly enough it turns into something of a music video. There's techno music blasting as the shots are edited together faster and faster until it's nothing but a blur of gory shot, mostly only about 5 frames long (which is about 1/6 of a second) flashing across the screen in time with the speed techno music. Clever, I guess, but it has no place in a horror movie because it completely removes any sense of scariness or tension of even the gross-out effect because you can't see any one thing for long enough to react to it. You're just watching these shots fly across the screen and wondering what the hell the director was thinking when he decided that it would be a good idea to put something like this in the movie.\n\nI've seen a lot of people compare this movie to Resident Evil, mostly claiming that it copies the premise of it, and they're exactly right. I appreciate that at least here, as was not the case in Resident Evil, it wasn't some man-made virus that turned people into walking dead that were able to infect other people, changing them the way vampires turn others into vampires. 28 Days Later was also clearly an inspiration for this movie, it's just too bad that House of the Dead didn't do a single original thing, except for the somewhat moronic idea of putting in quick shots of the video game on which it is based, just in case you forget. I really think that this should have been a much better movie. While obviously I can't say that I know much about the game it's based on, just the title and the movie poster deserve a much better movie, but unfortunately I think that's more often the case than not with horror movies. It's really kind of sad when a movie comes out that is so obviously advertised as a no-holds-barred horror film, and the scariest thing in the entire movie is the closing shot, which suggests the possibility of a sequel."

Blood, 2. Boobs, 3. Beasts and this movie has all three in spades. The action scenes are hyper stylized yet original and interesting. The zombie effects are reminiscent of Lucio Fulci's \"Zombie\", plus they are practical effects, a super bonus considering many films, even those made in 2002 were relying far too heavily on cheap CGI effects. I will offer that some of the acting is pretty ridiculous at best but some performances including Clint Howard's are truly genre classic. Avoiding all story spoilers, as I think this film should be experienced in the purest way possible, I would like to point out overall the story moves at a brisk pace and never tests the audience in their patience. This film offers a lot for horror fans and whatever your previous opinion of this film is or if you haven't seen it yet I implore you to watch it again/first time with an open mind and a youthful enthusiasm for the strange and fantastic."

However upon watching it, you can quickly see what this movie really is.\n\nIt is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more and more gory. There is no horror here folks. Just some half-way decently staged action scenes which soon grow tiresome because they last... and last... and last... and soon you get the feeling maybe you're DVD player accidentally skipped back 3 minutes, but no, this is how they actually made the movie. It's a pity. I think anyone could find a better use for $7 million dollars in the movie industry than make this lump o' crud. Though some of the 360 effects were cool, but once again, they were over used and grew tedious since it was the same stunt over and over again each time, just with a different character.\n\nAlso what is ROYALLY annoying is the splicing on of footage from the arcade game. I've played the game. It sucks. So why did they put it in here? Oh that's right, this isn't a movie but a music video, and it's a poor one at that. 3/10\n\nRated R: a lot of violence/gore, and profanity"

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not sure about this film. Are the film makers idiots or are they just making a film and marketing it to idiots? All I know for sure is that this is a dumb film....no, it's an offensive and dumb film. Everyone in the film seems vacuous and worthless--with dialog and actions that constantly reaffirm this. Their greatest interests in life are partying, cursing and taking off their clothes...period. So, when they all start to get killed off like in a Friday the 13th film, you really could care less.\n\nThis incredibly obnoxious and unsubtle film was, not surprisingly, made by Uwe Boll--the man responsible for many films based on video games. So, we have perhaps the worst living film director AND a film based on a video game...does it get any worse than this?! Viewers are treated to lots of blood and gore, many explicit scenes of vomiting and girls who take their clothes off for absolutely no reason. The latter is really weird, as the film was filmed in the Pacific Northwest--and people all were wearing jackets and long sleeve shirts--yet, in this bizarro world, girls just gotta rip off their clothes in some of the most gratuitous scenes you could imagine. Perhaps ut even then it might make sense if this were a porn video...a bad porn video. Instead, this crap was marketed mostly to teens and stupid people.\n\nThe plot, for what it is, is very simple. A group of vacuous and horny young adults(?) take a boat to a party on an island known as \"the Isle of Death\" for some sex and alcohol. Instead, people start turning into zombies and ripping each other to pieces. Yet, inexplicably, many of the prey know cool martial arts skills OR turn out to have high-tech weapons with inexhaustible supplies of bullets!!! The dumbest is the captain of a crappy fishing boat--who suddenly sports a high-powered rifle with a scope and laser!!!! What the heck?!? Overall, it's a movie with all action that's set to a loud Euro-pop beat. There is nothing in the way of plot, acting or caricatures---just zombies, cursing, nudity and death. If you LIKE the idea of a virtually plot less film with no acting or writing--just zombies, death and annoying music, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, it's a waste of time and clearly deserving its place on IMDb's Bottom 100 list."

When you can't help but bust out laughing at the sheer terrible nature of the trash littering your screen? \"House of the Dead\" struggles to achieve even this low graded level of cinema.\n\nFrom start to end \"House of the Dead\" manages to recreate the feeling like you've just woken up to find out that the cat has laid it's curled business neatly on your forehead while you slept. It is clear from the start that the female actors have been cast for their cleavage size (which they exploit shamelessly) whereas the males for their hardcore \"kick-ass\" attitude. I honestly did not care any of the characters for any moment of the film and found myself actually wishing their demise so as to spare me a good hour of this torture. Uwe Boll should have considered screening two hours of footage from the actual game as a movie. At least then we'll get better acting\u0085 However not all blame can be placed on the actors as it is certainly a challenge to produce a convincing film when faced with the script of this film. It is arguably the worst section of the film and actually contains such lines as: \"These are zombies, pure and simple\" and \"No cap'n, we must not go there! It's evil!\".\n\nWe all know that Zombie movies are never going to be particularly thought provoking or full of meaning; at best they are a harmless two hours of action, blood and closet terror. Trash, yes, but entertaining trash. Not the kind of trash which bursts out of your bin bag as you haul it across the room and smothers your shoes in sour milk cartons and decaying banana skins. According to IMDb, \"House of the Dead\" received such bad reviews that no Danish cinemas bought the movie. If only we could have had the same privilege.\n\nFinal Score: 1/10."

But every once in a rare while, I see a movie so hilariously, over-the-top godawful that it's actually entertaining. It's hard to believe this wasn't specifically made for MST3K or the golden days of USA Up All Night. From the overuse of \"bullet time\" in an action sequence so long that it actually outlasts the rap metal song that accompanies it, to the model-looking raver girl who can apparently do kung-fu in heels, to the inexplicable random cuts to video game screencaps in the middle of action scenes for no reason that's ever given, to the completely non-uniform zombie makeup (as if they'd just told all the extras \"show up in zombie costume\"), to the fact that there isn't even a \"House\" in this movie despite the name (it's set almost entirely outdoors in the woods on a remote island), virtually everything about this movie is a cinematic mistake, from start to finish. And that level of failure is just not something you see very often. It's really kind of spectacular.\n\nHere's all you need to know: if you've ever been scrolling through some streaming service, looking for a braindead, lousy, fun movie, and came across a horror movie with Clint Howard top billed, and you realized that could be exactly what you were in the mood for - this is movie is the exact glorious, steaming pile of total garbage you were hoping that movie would be."

        "review_detailed_main": "=====This review may contain spoilers=====\n\nOK, here's the \"plot\": A group of college students are on their way to the \"rave of the century,\" only to find that they missed the boat. They hire a fishing boat captain to take them there. Once they arrive, they find the place completely trashed and everyone is missing (only one of them thinks that this is weird). When searching for the other ravers, our heroes instead find themselves face to face with a pack of vicious, blood-thirsty zombies. Will they survive the night? Frankly, you won't care because you'll be too busy thinking of increasingly brutal things to do to the director of this train wreck, Uwe Boll.\n\nWhat can be said that hasn't already been said about this movie? It is one of the worst movies of all-time and it's not difficult to see why. It's terrible not only because it has nothing in common with the video game it is based on, but because it is so incompetent on every level imaginable.\n\nThe cinematography is amateurish and laughable. The movie seems to have been edited by a chimpanzee. Huge chunks of plot and scenes are left on the cutting floor. The action sequences are edited in ways that would make Michael Bay look like James Cameron. It's not entirely clear what the heck is going on, whether it is a sword-fight, a shootout, or a simple chase. Oh, and did I mention that Boll inserts clips from the game into the action? I'm NOT making this up! He actually does this! Why? I have no clue. Probably because he thought it looked cool, but it just makes the whole thing confusing, pointless, and stupid. Equally questionable is Bowl's abusive use of bullet-time. Every time someone shoots at a zombie, a camera does a 360 degree angle swoop around him/her. Again, I have no idea why except that Bowel thought it looked cool. But AGAIN, it just looks cheap and ridiculous, and it gave me a headache. And I just HAVE to say this, but whenever the characters go into bullet-time mode, they are holding a different weapon then they were in the previous shot!\n\nOkay, so the editing and action sucks, but it's not the biggest problem. The acting was absolutely atrocious, and the dialogue was even worse. The actors playing the 20-somethings look too old to still be in college. I cringed every time they (or anyone else for that matter) opened their mouths and said something. Here are some lines that should go down as classics:\n\n-\"I found this book. It looks pretty old. Maybe it will help us.\"\n\n-\"It looks like it's been there for a millennia.\"\n\n-\"You did this to become immortal. Why?\"\n\n-\"Look at that house. Should we go inside?\"\n\n-\"We tried to get to the boat, but it wasn't there.\"\n\n-\"They're obviously zombies, plain and simple. The sooner we accept that, the sooner we can move on with our lives.\"\n\nThose are but a few lines of dialogue these we have to sit through. What's more, the actors can't act if their lives depended on it. They show zero emotion and give their characters no personality whatsoever. They often talk as if they are reading from note cards. And whenever one of them dies, they show curiously little sadness. Even the major stars, Jurgen Prochnow and Clint Howard (who plays Prochnow's first mate) appear embarrassed to be on screen. We don't really know who these people are, so we could care less about what happens to them. Oh, and can someone PLEASE tell me how a group of college students who have never even touched a gun before magically become an expert shot AND a Kung fu master all in less than a minute? Jesus! Talk about plot holes (out of millions, trust me)! There is also a weird attempt to explain how the zombies were created. What it is I will not say, except that it doesn't make any sense and actually raises more questions than it answers.\n\nThe movie is extremely cheap-looking, too. The zombies look like extras with some gray powder thrown in their face. Sometimes they don't have any make-up on at all! Speaking of which, these \"zombies\" act most un-zombie-like. They can swim, leap incredible heights (thanks to some obviously placed trampolines), run, and even use weapons. WTF?!?!?! Oh, and zombies can't be killed, OK? In this movie, if you slash at them, shoot them anywhere on their bodies (hip, shoulder, chest, head, etc.), they die. NO! AND ZOMBIES DON'T BLEED, OK?! Man, this movie gives me a headache just trying to figure it out. Anyway, the sets look terrible as well. In particular, the titular house and the graveyard surrounding it both look like they were stolen from the Haunted Mansion ride in Disneyland. And apparently the house is magic, because it looks tiny on the outside, but is absolutely enormous inside.\n\nI could go on and on how horrific this monstrosity is. It's worse than getting three root canals, in one day! It's worse than anything Paul W.S. Anderson can throw at us (now that's scary!). It makes you realize that suicide may not be such a bad idea after. Well actually, I don't recommend that, but you know what I mean. I could go on, but that would result in a twenty-page essay. I will conclude this review by saying that Uwe Boll is without a dount the worst filmmaker alive. This movie alone cements his status as the modern-day equivalent of Ed Wood. Hands down one of the ten worst movies I've ever seen. Stay away if you know what's good for you.\n\nRating: 1/10 Grade: F If I could go lower, I would.\n\nP.S. Sorry this was a long review. I just had to get the anger I felt after watching this steaming pile of cow-crap off my chest."

        "review_detailed_main": "One thing is clear. Until i met a great educational flick called 'House Of The Dead' by Dr. Uwe Boll, there had been not a single film that i decided stop watching in the middle of viewing. Yes i mean it. I never quit a movie in the middle of watching it no matter how it sucks or bores because i'm a type of guy who is over-patient and likes the phrase \"it ain't over til it's over\". Once i play a movie, then i finish it by all means, only unless inevitable things happen and force me to quit it in the middle. That was basic cinema-watching attitude of mine for 30 years.\n\nAnd then suddenly, one day about a year ago, i happened to meet this great educational flick and it broke my history just like a revolution. I played it, and Jesus can you believe, i quit and ran exactly at 40 minutes without any special situations or reasons.\n\nYogi, i'm afraid you're wrong. Something must be over before it's over...\n\nThat's not only thing that i learned from this great educational flick. I admit that i generally tend to ignore (or intentionally skip) others' reviews or comments on some films which i've not seen yet, and especially for majority of opinions i don't care for them at all. Yes it's just like \"I don't listen to anybody before viewing it myself and valuating is just mine\"..... But with this great educational flick, i learned that sometimes i need to be more open to others' WARNINGS at least.\n\nAfter all, this film had such huge educational effects on me and i can't help giving it 10/10 for it."

It happened to me with In the Name of the King, which I rather enjoyed. And there's The Bride of the Monster, which does have some stupid moments and pacing issues, but I still don't view it as catastrophic. Manos: The Hands of Fate is bad, but I respect Harold Warren for creating a movie without any kind of education in film.\n\nSo, let's turn to House of the Dead. The first 20-25 minutes were quite good. The movie begins with a short and not-too-informative introduction to the four teens that wish to get to some island, and have fun with friends there. Some, who are pickier about movies than I am, say that characters are best introduced through action than any narration, but not much is revealed about them, so it's no big deal. The dialog sequence aboard the ship was clever, funny, and served its purpose of establishing the characters, especially the captain.\n\nMany complained about the characters' decision to stay at the deserted camp instead of running away, but please note that all but Alicia was drunk, so don't expect them to make rational decisions. Was Alicia's decision to go investigate rational? No, it wasn't, but the movie had to move forward, didn't it?\n\nThe movie went on, and I haven't gotten the impression that it was as bad as the reviews suggested it was. It looked like a typical horror movie, and it continued and ended that way. There are dark places, zombies sneaking in the forest, characters getting introduced (and killed), a hooded figure in the distance observing the humans, etc. The usual horror move stuff.\n\nPossibly weakest part of the movie is the big shoot-out scene in front of the house. It's spectacular, but way too long. They kill zombies by the dozens, and not much else happens. One may argue that the battle scenes in The Lord of the Rings trilogy are even longer, but there are twists in them that serve a narrative purpose.\n\nAlso everyone aims perfectly, and they don't run out of ammo until the plot requires them to. Neither is an unheard-of plot device, but since the fight is very long, it becomes noticeable.\n\nI also don't understand the narrative purpose of the in-game clips. It would have been better if Boll left them out entirely.\n\nSurely, HotD isn't a *good* movie, but I fail to see why it received so much flak. I basically mentioned everything I disliked about HotD, and that's all I could find in a 90-minute-long movie. There are things I liked as well. Pacing is generally good, the dialogs are decent, acting is surprisingly good for a movie with this average rating. The flaws don't outweigh the pros, so I give it a 6."

One needs to believe what's happening in a movie to see the humor when a situation goes incredibly wrong. Without boundaries, the movie becomes absurd. HotD lacks any believability.\n\nWorse still, HotD brings nothing new to the genre, and repeats the same plot twists and character reactions that many horror movies inevitably start to exhibit. For example, all too often, horror movies fall into the trap where the main characters find love amongst the gore and destruction. I don't know about you, but when I'm being chased by zombies, I wanna make out with a hot chick. Believe it? No? Then, you probably won't believe it when the characters start sucking each other's faces in this movie.\n\nBeyond the obvious issues that plague this movie like so many other horror movies, Uwe Boll elected to add scenes from the video game of zombies being shot, randomly whenever a character shoots a zombie in the movie. Not only is there no clear rationale for this artistic choice, but it distracts one from an already unbelievable plot. Further, there are frequent and numerous examples of bad acting, and seemingly no attempts by the director to guide the actors' reactions to events... leaving the movie with no redeeming qualities.

Is it supposed to be a comedy?, or horror? or both? Before I knew it I fell asleep at the second half & woke up during the end credits so I did not manage to watch all of it, which is a good thing!

I know nobody was expecting high art, but even within it's meagre aspirations, there are still some pretty glaring flaws.\n\nFor starters, it's hilariously dated. From the aggressive techno soundtrack, to the fashion, to the insistence on some very of the time visual effects, especially that good 'ol Matrix style slow mo bullet bit. It's also from the last era to put such blatant sexism on full display, to call the nudity in this gratuitous is an understatement.\n\nIt barely has any connection to the arcade game outside of the zombie theme, and tries to make up for this by including gameplay footage, which is the most ridiculously tacky thing since that first Doom movie did a whole scene first person shooter style.\n\nTo top it off, the whole thing just looks really cheap and generally has the feel of a made for TV movie. This is pretty understandable though as the budget was only *checks notes* twelve million dollars... wait, what? Where did that money go? I guess that Matrix effect ain't cheap, damn!"

In this movie you don't bond with any of the characters because... you don't get a chance.\n\nThe only character that is sympathetic or even interesting is the Deck Hand: Salish as played by Clint Howard. Except for this unique character, the outcome of the movie is meaningless as all the characters were lifeless from the begining.\n\nMistake 2: the worst gunfight scene ever. I love gunfights. I love when the heros open up on the badguys and clean house. heck I even like to watch a badguy clean house sometimes. But this gunfight was weird I guess that the best way to describe it is \"Apathetic\" I've seen people shoot with more feeling and emotion while PLAYING THE VIDEOGAME. In this movie it looked and felt like the \"Actors\" were simply walking through shooting everything that moved without emotion.\n\nWhy? Where's the trash talking? where's the snarls of rage amongst the gunfire? These are supposed to be kids that got caught at a rave gone bad... but even real soldiers acting professionally and ruthlessly show their humanity.\n\nIf you want a GOOD horror movie about a secluded house full of monsters, I recomend Sam Rami's Evil Dead series.

It's so bad, you'll feel ashamed and dirty all over after the entire affair (assuming you don't turn this off 10 minutes into it).\n\nI had VERY low expectations for this movie. A trailer and teaser came on my Xbox version of House of the Dead 3. It looked pretty bad already, and a teaser is supposed to show all the good bits and make you want to go to theatres. This trailer definitely didn't, so you know you're in trouble as a film maker. It looked like a crappy costume party in the woods, or a high school film student's work. I finally saw it a few days ago to see why everyone hated it so much. Hard as it is to believe, this movie goes way below my worst expectations and even the harshest reviews aren't harsh enough. It's more horrible than I could have ever imagined. Every possible facet of this movie so completely bad! It defies belief that a man can be so stupid.\n\nSometimes critics have subjective reasons for disliking a film. There is no room for subjectivity here. This movie is an unequivocal and irrefutable heap of steaming turd. Uwe Boll, how can you sleep at night?! Shame on you and everyone associated with this abomination of celluloid garbage. Jurgen Prochnow of Das Boot fame, how low you've sunk!! Canadian punk singer Bif Naked just lost all points for her cameo.\n\nThere is nothing redeeming about this movie, unless you count the fact that we see 2 examples of boobage in the first 10 minutes. Never mind the fact that Boll took the name of the game literally and actually made a house of the dead in the wood... Everything about this movie is idiotic. Characters with weapons at the ready stand doing nothing, looking like morons as their friends get chomped by zombies. Boll does the Matrix spin with EVERY character as they fire off their weapon. Lame. The makeup is horrible. Acting is horrible.. The game had plenty of source material and bad guys to choose from. It could've been a great action, sci-fi/horror film in the vein of Resident Evil (which was mediocre as a film, but Oscar gold compared to this monstrosity).\n\nIf you like torture, watch this movie. I suggest Drain-o if you really want to kill yourself. It's much quicker."

Poor acting, predictable characters, heck, even the nudity is poor (no offense to the actress).\n\nMaybe Uwe Boll is actively trying to be like Ed Wood, believing that after he is dead a neo-Tim Burton will create a masterful biopic of his awful movies.

Taking a similar approach to the previous year's Resident Evil adaptation, the film was intended to be a prequel to the game series to allow for some leeway in approaching the adaptation, but none of that really matters because the movie is one of the worst and most incompetently made movies to EVER received a wide release.\n\nThe story of the movie (and I use the words \"story\" and \"movie\" loosely) is so incompetently structured with overdone narration and haphazardly structured flashbacks that you'd swear this was a first time production from all involved. The characters are all beyond brainless as they spend $1,000 to charter a boat to go to this rave and when they arrive to find the place deserted and a mess with clear signs of something bad having happened their first instinct is to have sex and drink! The movie's plot is so anorexicly thin that it could hardly serve as the basis for a light gun game, let alone an entire movie.\n\nThe technical aspects of the movie are equally woeful, throughout the movie scenes from the House of the Dead video game are randomly spliced into scenes with no rhyme or reason, and the sequences are poorly set up with cheap looking shots and bad framing. The movie also overuses arc shots to a ridiculous degree, as many action sequences will consist of shots wherein the camera circles around a character whilst standing perfectly still. The actors who play our motley crew of idiots range from passable to not even trying, one particular scene that is downright laughable is a sequence early on that involves one of the women being vomited on and her reaction looks like giggling more than disgust. There are two exceptions to the bad acting on display and they are J\u00fcrgen Prochnow and Clint Howard as Captain Kirk and his first mate Salish respectively. Despite the quality of the movie they're in, both of them aren't sleep walking and bring their A-Game to c-grade material.\n\nDespite House of the Dead doing nearly every tenet of basic film making and story telling wrong, I have to admit that I kind of love this movie. It's a bad movie, but it's also an entertaining movie that needs to be viewed. Much like \"so bad they're good\" staples like Troll 2, The Room, Miami Connection, and the myriad of other laughable schlock that lives in infamy, House of the Dead deserves its place among this revered group so it may be enjoyed sober, high, buzzed, or any other number of states so it's awkwardness and shoddiness can be gawked at. It's a piece of crap that I'll recommend to any bad movie fan."

        "review_detailed_main": "Going to a small island for a party, a group of revelers finds the entire area overrun by vicious flesh-eating zombies raised from the dead by a deadly chemical and must find a way of stopping the creatures and getting off the island alive.\n\nThis is an unfairly maligned zombie effort that has a lot going for it. One of the better features here is the rather impressive suspense built up here, whether done through the jungle location where it's all set up in the traditional gloomy, oppressive jungle shrubs that really give off a great vibe or the opening scenes of the chaos-riddled party that doesn't strike as being odd and off-the-wall enough to really warrant that kind of attention which pays off in a rather tense beginning. Compounding it all as well is the film's singular best quality in its relentless action that pretty much runs throughout the film as a whole, initially serving as the perfect payoff for the suspense-filled opening while offering up plenty of exciting moments. There's plenty of action here that starts off with the attacks in the forest filled with oncoming swarms of zombies that are appearing behind trees and underwater all along a rather fun and exciting series of chases and encounters. The main part of the excitement here is the centerpiece assault on the group as they race into the shack which is readily filled with tons of blasting gunshots, zombies heads blasts apart, limbs hacked off and martial arts moves all being utilized against the zombies in a delirious ten-minute plus sequence that also manages to feature tons of stunt-work and gory action to make for a spectacular highlight. Other big action scenes include the final battle in the house where the reanimated bodies all start coming back to life in the lab while the battle in the tunnel features some creepy zombie make-up and leads into the thrilling sword fight at the finale. Along with that fantastic zombie make-up and fun gore, these are enough to build this up against the few flaws here, which include the continuous video-game sequences in the middle of a random scene which is quite aggravating for the quantity of times its done and the selection of scenes it showcases. They're distracting, don't fit the tone of what's happening and seem to be done merely to placate fans of the game. The only other flaw here is the decision to utilize the running zombie tactics that's just completely unrelated to anything in the film that we're given as to the source of their resurrection. These here are the film's only real flaws that hold it down.\n\nRated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Nudity, and drug use."

I think that a lot of the comments that are made on here are by folks that don't respect the undead movies of Romero etc. This film was actually a different change of pace. It offers a cross between Dawn of The Dead and Island of Dr. Moreau. The special effects were grand to watch and the story kept the film going. It gave us new faces in which I hope to see again in the future. instead of going by what others say deciding that you are not going to see this film I say give it a shot it's definitely entertaining!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I mean honestly, what were you expecting. It's a film titled House of the Dead. Based on a video game thats already out of date. With a low budget and no name actors. I know my expectations came no where near the top with this one and I was decently suprised. Is it a bad movie? Oh yes. But it's heart is in the right place. One thing for sure is that the filmmakers did a good job capturing the video games atmosphere. There are scenes incorpated into the film right from the game. As a long time game and genre fan I can appreciate the slight throwbacks to it's core audience. The film doesn't really represent any one of the games although I'm quite sure it acts as a prequel to them. The same way the infintely better Resident Evil did. it's about a supposed killer rave(That looks more like a ho down) on a island where the people are suddenly attacked buy a weirdos zombie experiments and turned into food for the fast and ever growing undead population. The film really is nothing more than that. There are some cool but overused camera techniques. Mostly stolen from other films but used in creative ways and some decent splatter fx accompanied with hilariously intentional and unintentional dialogue and scenes. Plus alot of unnecessary gratious nudity. So once again was this film bad? yes. Was it entertaining? damn right it was. It's a gutsy, gory little action horror flick made specifically for the fun of it! And if you see it as anything else well than the joke is on you."

I walked past a movie theatre recently and felt a shudder go down my spine. I haven't been to the cinema since and I'm not sure if I will be able to ever again. Uwe Boll believes he is a genius. He is not. He is waging a war on cinema, ethnically cleansing good character development, dialogue and continuity from the silver screen.

He's also really successful at both of those of those things meaning he's continued to make these movies and threatening to beat up his critics whenever they give him a bad review.\n\nThe story is a group of friends go to an island for a rave but when they get there the place is deserted. They happen upon a creepy old house, there's zombies, they fight and most of them die in the process. That's pretty much it.\n\nThe acting is bad. The overall look of the movie is bad. The entire process is just flawed from start to finish. And if you've ever played the game it's based on you will ask yourself \"WTF was that?\" because it's nothing like the game.\n\nAnd the worst part of it is there's a \"funny\" version of this movie. Most of it was made up with outtakes or giving the actors free reign to act \"funny\". And then when that didn't work, they just added fart noises whenever you saw somebody's butt. Are you laughing yet? Uwe Boll seems to think that's funny.\n\nHonestly, there's nothing worth watching here."

When they get there, the island is desolated. They think they have the party for themselves, but, of course, that is the beginning of their trouble.\n\nThis movie bases itself on a homonymous video game, which I think is funny. It is funny that movies love to get inspiration from video games instead of trying to recreate the video game's plot. I really don't understand.\n\nAnyway. I'm ok with trash movies. Sometimes they are acceptable, sometimes they are even masterpieces. This movie is none. It's complete trash with plank acting and nonsense. Characters are just plain dumb and stereotypical. Dismissable.\n\nDirector Uwe Boll is famous for his video game-into-movie adaptations and boobies. Yes. About 10 minutes of the screenplay and you get your fair share. Bravo.\n\nThe ending is mediocre, but it has one final little detail. Nice touch. However, by this point, this movie is already dommed.\n\nTotally not recommendable to regular watchers. This one is only for hardcore zombie fans. But don't quote me on this one."

        "review_detailed_main": "If there were a movie that deserved a 0 out of 10, this would be it. 'House of the Dead' redefines the term \"bad movie\". Other bad movies, such as 'When A Stranger Calls' or 'Premonition', will actually look much better when compared to 'House of the Dead'. The basic \"plot\" of House of the Dead is a group of twenty-somethings travel to a remote island to attend the \"rave of the century\". When they get there, they only find some tents, a bar, a stage, and some bloody t-shirts. They decide to stay anyway, and they are soon attacked by zombies.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing redeeming about this movie. It is not entertaining. Instead, it is painful to watch because of how terrible it is. The acting is unbelievably bad. In a DVD interview, one of the actors claimed that Uwe Boll, the director, is not afraid to tell someone when they are doing a good job or a bad job in a scene. This is a blatant lie. The script appears to have been written by an 11-year-old, who decided to include a scene of someone throwing up on a girl's chest and to include the hilarious line, \"it smells like someone farted out here.\" The characters have no personality or depth and they do some of the most moronic things ever seen in a horror movie. Somewhere along the way, the characters also magically transform into a SWAT team to take down the zombies. It's like they don't even have to aim their guns and they automatically shoot the zombies in the head.\n\nThe scariest thing by far about this movie is the directing. There is something wrong with Uwe Boll. Boll's camera work is astonishingly disjointed. His pans to zombies running through the forest are more silly than menacing. Worse yet, Boll actually thought it would be a good idea to include small bits of footage from the House of the Dead video game into the movie. Quite often, and at the most random times, you will suddenly see an animated zombie getting shot. It makes no sense. No one in their right mind would think that was a good idea. It's like Boll wants to remind us repeatedly that this movie is supposed to be based on the video game. Uwe Boll also decided it would be cool to include slow motion 360 degree rotating shots during the action scenes, a la 'The Matrix'. Unfortunately, he does it way too often and each shot is nauseating. The soundtrack to this movie also boggles the mind. Most action scenes are accompanied by loud rap track. This also adds to the ensuing headaches caused by the atrocious 'House of the Dead'.\n\n'House of the Dead' isn't bad because it's based on a video game. In fact, it has very little to do with the video game. It also does not fit into the category of 'so bad that it's good'. It does however fit into the category of 'so bad that it's painful'. This movie just plain sucks. Uwe Boll should never be let anywhere near another movie set. Even his presence will curse a production. To all the directors out there: whenever one of your movies gets a bad review, all you have to do is remember that you didn't make 'House of the Dead' and you will feel much better. I will never get those 90 minutes of my life back. To sum it up, words really cannot describe just how bad this movie is. Everyone involved in the production of this film, especially Uwe Boll, should be ashamed of themselves. Although what I have said may make 'House of the Dead' sound funny, it really isn't. Nothing about it is funny. Avoid this at all costs."

We were not alone as the rest of the cinema-going public gradually and steadily began to join in our appreciation of what we had just seen. Many of them may have been doing so with a sense of irony or relief. Simply pleased to have made it through such a lacklustre piece of Hollywood bilge. But not us. Oh no! this is a film that we have talked about - not only in the long car journey back to our humble small town - but on numerous occasions at our local, college and with others who have yet to see this delightful feast of zombism.\n\nIt is to my shame that I can only claim to have seen this film once as firstly I did not wish to view it again at the multiplex for fear it would not make me laugh with such a relish as in my first sitting and secondly due to a lack of a DVD release date. Get it sorted executive types!! this is cult classic in the making.\n\nYou may have seen this film and hated it. My advice to you is forget everything you know about what makes a good movie and sit back, relax and enjoy a slice of Gratuitous over acting, pointless nudity and unapologetic ripoffs of all your favourite action films. The Wachowski brother had better get their lawyers ready for this one as it mimics the matrix's moves with unbelievable incompetence\n\nA sense of humour is required and rewarded! oh by the way its not a comedy but who cares?

Main characters die so fast you wonder if there will be anyone left after 30 minutes. Camera angles twist and turn abruptly just like the video game. The action scenes are spliced together with scenes from the video game. Forget comparisons to other movies, this is The House of the Dead video game come to life.\n\nDespite the shortcomings I enjoyed the fast pace, the twisty camera angles and most of all, the relentless hoards of zombies that serve as cannon fodder for the teenagers turned zombie assassins.

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm trying to picture what went on in the boardroom when this film was greenlighted. With the success of Resident Evil fresh in the memory of Hollywood, someone obviously thought that films based on video games were now the in thing. Never mind, of course, that Resident Evil was given a halfway decent story, good realisation, and a credible cast. No, video game-based films are suddenly fashionable, so we don't need those things, right? Well, the four production companies behind this mess obviously thought so. They were wrong. Dead wrong, if you'll pardon the pun.\n\nYou might want to stop reading now if you want to be surprised by the incredible stupidity of this film. Anyway, our principal characters get an invite to some kind of party that is on an island that most mariners need to be paid incredible sums to think about visiting. The party organisers have transport, but it gets worse from this point.\n\nWhat defies belief is that brief snippets of footage from the video game are inserted throughout the film. Yes, we know this dross is based on a video game, we don't need screenshots from said game to remind us of the fact. Another thing they copied from the video game was the convoluted excuse for the partygoers and other incredibly stupid specimens to be on the island. What's even more incredible is how the heroes suddenly display skills that the audience haven't been made privy to. Suddenly, the afro girl can do kung fu with the zombies, and the previously green partygoers are wielding swords. One of the girls can even sustain wounds that would be fatal to men who have spent most of their lives building their muscular system. Don't ask me how she does it. I'm sure even the writers in this case don't know.\n\nA big part of the problem is that nothing shown in the film is given the appropriate level of setup. We don't know why these people are going to the island, smuggling things, or trying to arrest each other. They're just doing these incredibly stupid things. The dynamics of the zombies are not clearly defined, either. We're never given any explanation as to why they exist, or at least one that doesn't stretch credulity to breaking point. We get some drivel involving a Conquistador and some kind of experiment to prolong life, or something. Why anyone would have wanted to prolong their life in such a world begs for explanation. Explanation is apparently not in Uwe Boll's vocabulary.\n\nSpare a thought for J\u00fcrgen Prochnow. Appearing in this kind of Z-grade dreck is one hell of a comedown for the man who played the captain in Das Boot, the yardstick by which all submarine films are judged. I know he must be desperate to appear in anything after Judge Dredd, but this is just silly.\n\nI gave House Of The Dead a one out of ten. Don't mistake this to mean I think the film is bad enough to be good. It is so bad that it stops being good at about the halfway point and becomes excruciating. The only reason to watch it is for bragging rights in a contest to see who has watched the worst films."

Is there one shred of concern for the missing partygoers by the latecomers? Not a bit. As a matter of fact, when zombies start killing people off, there's even less concern. The performances of the young actors are flat and uninspiring, you don't have any sympathy for their plight. The main 'ghoul' in the film doesn't even show up until the very end and what could have been an interesting plot is a ludicrous script with flashes of video game imagery and lots of firepower.\n\nThe entire time the outnumbered partiers are racing about trying to escape this Godforesaken flick, not one tear is shed or one genuine scream released. If zombies were chasing you, I think you'd care just a wee bit more about the reality of your situation. One dramatic scene comes when the policewoman has her legs chewed off by zombies while the male lead is dragging her through a window. He offers a half-assed guilty speech on the uselessness of his lifesaving effort. Maybe his performance falls on its face because the rest of the material is so sucky, but really the speech comes too late for anyone to care.\n\nDo not spend any money to see this film. Do not wait for it on cable because you'll never get those 90 minutes of your life back. If you want to see an effective zombie flick, you're better off with 28 Days Later or one of the classics such as 'Dawn of the Dead'. But take this stinker off your curiosity radar...destroy the urge and forget this title exists and you'll lead a richer life.\n\nIt's a big, fat stinker."

        "review_detailed_main": "Even though I am not a fan of horror movies at all, I wanted to see HOUSE OF THE DEAD because of the many bad things I heard about it, and I really wished that I have watched something else instead of this one!\n\nThis incredibly tiresome and stupid movie was directed by Uwe Boll, that is famous for directing movies based on video-games. So this movie is directed by a bad director (MUCH worse than Ed Wood) and it's based on a awful video-game. Much worse than this???? The plot: some stupid and horny adults go on a island known as Isla de los Muertos (Island of the Dead) for having fun. But instead everyone turns into zombies and rips each other's skin. Yet with no explanation whatsoever the victims know martial arts and have always huge supplies of weapons for killing the blood-thirsty zombies. And Jurgen Prochnow is wasted as the boat Captain because his role is so underwritten that it comes off as awkward.\n\nThere isn't really much plot - just zombies, cursing, nudity and violence. If you love this stuff then this is a movie perfect for you and you'll love it. But if you are NOT a horror fan (like me) and you like intelligent movies, you must steer clear from this dumb and obnoxious film that deserves to be on IMDB's Bottom 100 (at #7 place)."

Bad acting, bad story, bad make-up, bad cinematography, etc. Let's just say there was not one single thing about this movie that was good.\n\nFirst of all, what the hell was the deal with the 'zombies'? They were gargoyles with glow-in-the-dark red eyes.. zombies don't look like that. Those things were the least scary things I've ever seen in my entire life. I'd be more afraid of a dandelion stem than I would the \"zombies\" in this movie.\n\nThe acting was so bad, even worse than the worst you've seen in any other B movie. It was so bad, that it wasn't even funny. Sometimes, in B movies, the acting is really cheesy which makes it funny. The acting in this movie was far beyond that. It was just BAD.\n\nAnd, that's what's just sad. The incredibly cheesy video games are better in every way than the terrible movie. The acting, story, etc. are all lame and cheesy, but FAR better than the schlock in this waste of film. Even the pixelated, cartoonish zombies look so much more realistic than the black, red-eyed Swamp Thing \"zombies\" in this movie.\n\nHow the hell does Uwe Boll keep getting work? He continues his streak of destroying video game franchises, most recently with Bloodrayne, and now I hear he's doing Hit-man, and more.\n\nHey, Hollywood.. WHY DO YOU KEEP HIRING THIS GUY TO DIRECT?! His movies are the worst ever made in history, and they make NO MONEY. Seriously, somebody needs to kick this jackass out of the film industry."

What's bad about this film is the plot, the characters, the script, the way the film looks look, the unnecessary screenshots from the game, some boring moments.

The only thing he knows how to do is get the female cast to take their clothes off.\n\nThe best horror movies do not focus on nudity as the main event.

        "review_detailed_main": "Considering this movie is based directly on a game, this does make it a lot harder for the director and crew to write out the script to suit the game form and to please the gamer fans! I had not played the game before, though was amazed that director Uwe Boll used original game play footage of first HOTD game to go with the movie and do believe in some of the scenes they actually did work well! For example a scene when three humans are making an escape in an underground tunnel from the zombies, the use of a first person shooter, shooting zombies then straight away jumping to game form of that same moment, I believe did actually work very well for the scene.\n\nI give the film a 5/10 and unlike the other reviews I have read of people completely panning the movie. To be honest I did enjoy the movie's use of action scenes, humor and cheesy acting. I do believe maybe the movie could of been better if it was a bit more creepier and shocking in some parts. I did actually jump at one part when some small demon - skull swimming in a mist of red liquid emerged to the screen LOL.\n\nCome on seriously, how could you not enjoy that full on 7 minute fight scene in the middle of the movie?! Those spinning 360 degrees cameras around the actors are no longer used in films today! Please just don't look upon the movie and think \"Now that didn't go like that in the game!\" cos believe me, a director does try their hardest to please the fans and I know must be one of the difficultest things to place on screen, including book - movie adaption, and adding new things in the movie which wasn't in the game I believe isn't a so bad idea other wise is too predictable if you already played the game.\n\nAnyway I do think anyone could enjoy the full on action and gore the movie has to offer and not just hate the movie of not being exactly true to the game, and of course all zombie films usually have a cheesy b movie story: in this case early 20 year olds being trapped on an island with of course zombies, as they must try and reach the House of the Dead..."

This movie has so many editing mistakes, such a lame direction that it goes beyond words to describe. Boll truly gives directors a bad name!\n\nAnd what the hell is Jurgen Prochnow (Das Boot, Beverly Hills Cop 2, Air Force One) doing in there? How he has fallen!

It features Smallville's Erica Durance (credited as Erica Parker) topless on a beach. Then she goes for a topless swim. If Erica's scene was removed from this film, I'd rate it a 2 or 3. Look closely, you might not recognize her. It appears as though the movie was filmed prior to her teeth being fixed, new hair do, and what would seem to be absolutely awesome breast augmentation. If you're not a Smallville/Superman/Erica fan then pass on this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's a massive rave happening on a jungle infested island that has a demented past. A group of teenagers who are running late hitch a ride on fishing boat and they arrived to find the scene completely deserted. Though, something isn't quite right as they find an abandon house where they discover some party-goers who claimed that they were attacked by some sort of zombies. Now it's up to this group of people to figure a way to get off the island or they shall meet an unpleasant demise from hordes of zombies.\n\nSo, this is \"House of the dead\" and I just got to say it was just woefully incompetent schlock. I guess my curiosity just got the better of me when I saw it was playing on TV. While watching it, I thought it was on the music channel at times, as it mainly felt like an over-extended music clip. Director Uwe Boll's film is nothing but pretentious garbage and an incredibly lousy effort. It really has nothing going for it\u0085 well, it did have nice island scenery and fair makeup effects and a good amount of blood and gore. But these things couldn't carry this plain dreadful film. On show are paper-thin material and unlikeable characters. The actual lacklustre plot fails logic, it's filled with yawn inducing clich\u00e9s, even the back-story of these zombies is poorly setup and it ends with a diabolical finale. Though, what it sorely missed was humour! But then again it probably thought it was funny, but I just didn't see it. It felt like the film was actually taking itself rather serious and if so, well there you go. The performances are either wooden or atrocious and the characters are mundane and annoying. You just don't care for these hoons. There's even a young Bruce Campbell look alike, but he doesn't have the charisma or talent of that great actor. The dialogue is rather mindless drivel, which is filled with bad puns and mind numbing lines. It's nothing but tripe and stereotypical circumstances.\n\nThe direction is just a muddle. Boll was trying too hard to make his film super coooool. Instead he lacked imagination in his execution, therefore making it super dull and uneventful. What else didn't help was the dumb editing of sequences of the actual video game to cut to new scenes. The score was mostly nonexistent, but not the damn techno soundtrack that pop up during the action scenes\u0085 my ears!!! It was just too much. When the techno music kicked in, so did the flashy camera-work that also got on my nerves. With its 360 degrees camera shots and shaky panning. Though, it was the slow-mows, which Boll centred on and really, it was not needed. It was just too distracting and rather lame. These action set pieces went on for far too long, which made it feel like everything was in slow-mow. What didn't help these moments was that no tension was generated and the action was mainly unexciting and pedestrian. No scares or thrills are evident. The romance sequences were just odd and rather laughable, with some characters finding love while battling zombies. A lot moments became a real drag because they dwelled on nothingness and too many sequences became really repetitive e.g. too many save yourself scenarios and a lot chasing about\u0085 I mean a lot! Some shots were actually used over and over again. Yes, this is a pointless and unsatisfying mess of a production.\n\nAfter seeing this film you'll be thinking what the hell was that? Or why did I bother? Just plain boring and numbing is the best way of putting it!"

ALL the acting is lousy--I mean EVERYBODY!!!! There's not one good performance at all! Also, one of the guys is described as being very handsome and being an underwear model. He's not handsome and (very obviously) is not in great shape. They even cast the roles wrong!!!\n\nThe movie does deserve some credit--within the first 15 minutes we see two topless women--one of them at great length. Needless to say it has nothing to do with the plot.\n\nOh--and the \"plot\"! What little there is completely disappears by the last half hour. At that point they're all baricadded in a house with the zombies all outside trying to get in. What happens? Out of nowhere, one of the women finds a book and says \"This is book is pretty old. Maybe it can help us.\" (????!!!!!?????) WHAT THE F***! At that point I almost left. When a movie is insulting me like that... Really crappy zombie makeup too. They only show it in flashes...for good reason. When you get a clear view at the end it's laughable. And what the hell is the point of showing video game killings every once in a while? Yes...we KNOW it's based on a video game...you don't have to keep reminding us!\n\nStill, I sort of \"enjoyed\" it. It was so bad in every department it was amusing to watch (kind of). Also there's plentiful gore with some nice shots of heads exploding (the MPAA must have been asleep when they rated this one) and there's a (I swear) 10-15 minute non-stop massacre sequence in the middle that is both incredibly gory and hysterically funny (the director slows motion down at random and stops it to circle every single character...WHY???????). This is a perfect party movie. Rent it and you'll have the room laughing in minutes.\n\nOne last note--when I saw it 7 people were in the theatre--3 walked out. And one guy said to his girlfriend while leaving, \"There are some bad movies but that was the WORST!\" I give it a 1--I wish I could go lower!"

Yeah, our expectations are high, but at least give it your all. This movie adds to the mindset of games' lack of adaptability. Granted he had no $$ for this movie, Boll is still green, and it shows(washes with game footage?). However, if you look at it - and this is going to sound really weird - as a B-movie to sit down and pop a few beers with, this ain't that bad of a movie to watch. At the very least, it can show what NOT to do with a film, or great fodder for a drinking game with your buddies. I'll admit that I own this movie and that I watch it on occasion (makes no sense huh). I guess it's my soft spot for B-movies.

For me, though, such descriptions are unfair to Ed Wood, whose films were at the very least entertaining. HOUSE OF THE DEAD is nothing like; it's an awful film and even worse than the previous Boll film I watched, ALONE IN THE DARK.\n\nAn erstwhile adaptation of the popular arcade game, this is a traditional zombie film which sees a group of unwary ravers falling foul of some zombies that emerge from the depths of the ocean to wreak havoc upon the living. So far, so B-movie, but the direction and technical values are of such an appalling quality that even the most generous of movie buffs will struggle to enjoy this. Desperate attempts to interest viewers, such as the gratuitous nudity, fail to work, leaving this a train wreck of a film.\n\nIncredibly, Boll gets everything wrong at every point. The decision to include actual clips of the video game is stupid in the extreme. His direction is rubbish, as is the acting, even from seasoned genre veterans like Jurgen Prochnow and Clint Howard. The effects are poor and although the film contains non-stop action, it's thoroughly dull because said action is so poorly staged. Dull, dull, dull and silly throughout, comic book in style but lacking the energy and excitement of a comic book adaptation. The worst zombie movie ever made? Quite possibly, even with all the silly Italian zombie flicks out there."

        "review_detailed_main": "Another Uwe Boll video game adaptation means yet another inept effort at making a watchable film. This time we take what I'm sure is a heavily plotted, intelligent and character driven game that demanded a film adaptation (not really) and make it into a boring, generic zombie movie. It's \"House of the Dead\" people, and it sucks.\n\nThe plot begins with a character informing us that he will be the only survivor. I love it when bad movies spoil their own endings, it's the equivalent a kid with no legs challenging a pro soccer player to a game. Simon (Tyron Leitso) introduces his soon-to-be-dead friends: Greg (Will Sanderson), Alicia (Ona Grauer), Karma (Enuka Okuma) and Xynthia (Sonya Salomaa, possibly playing some kind of alien that happens to look like a human). They want to go to an awesome rave party taking place on an island but little do they know, the place is overrun by zombies. Hitching a ride there by paying two smugglers (Jurgen Prochnow as Captain Victor Kirk and his first Mate Salish, played by Clint Howard) they are chased by a harbor police officer named Jordan Casper (Ellie Cornell). It's a struggle for survival and a struggle for the audience to resist falling asleep.\n\nThe only good thing about this film is the makeup effects, which are actually pretty convincing. There's a huge army of zombies attacking our heroes and they come in all kinds of shapes and sizes. We've got aquatic zombies that can swim, moss-covered zombies that hide in the dirt, ancient skeletal zombies and even fresh zombies that basically look like regular people but with some blood all over them. If there's one good thing that could come out of this film, it's a recommendation to any aspiring horror filmmakers to hire the costume and makeup artists that were involved in this movie. Everything else is downright terrible.\n\nNot only does the movie drop the ball from the very beginning by telling us exactly who is going to make it out alive and who isn't but it commits the biggest sin in cinema \"show, don't tell\". We don't learn in any way that's organic who the main characters are, we are simply told exactly enough information to distinguish the actors from each other with exposition at the beginning of the movie. Considering the fact that the acting is pretty weak here, maybe it was a last minute decision by director Uwe Boll to avoid as many scenes of the actors talking as possible. Some would give props to the man, but I say next time, just hire real actors.\n\nThe plot is utterly predictable, not only because we are told ahead of time what is going to happen (no, I will not let that go), but because it doesn't do anything new when it comes to the zombie horror genre. Basically every scene of people talking is just an excuse to tie together an accompanying scene where the humans are running away from or shooting at zombies. To remind us that this is a video game movie, and also presumably to obliterate any tension that might arise, the film constantly flashes to video game-y scenes. We've got clips of the game the film is based on, as well as \"game over\" type screens for some of the characters that end up biting the dust. I wish I could make up something as stupid as this. Can you imagine if someone re-edited \"Saving Private Ryan\" and called it \"Call of Duty\" by adding \"game over\" screens whenever someone was shot down? Even that movie, which is widely accepted as a masterpiece would be laughed out of theaters, so what chance does \"House of the Dead\" have with its undead-like acting abilities and paper-thin story? The movie can't even stay consistent because only some of the actors are dignified with a death screen. Meanwhile, we get 32 nearly-identical shots of polygon-based undead creatures getting shot in the face.\n\nIt's never particularly scary and even if what the hacks in charge were aiming for was a horror-action movie, leaning more towards action it would still suck the big one. There's a big scene where all of the characters have found an ammo crate (get it? Like in a video game!) and suit up for battle. They make their way to the mysterious \"house of the dead\" and encounter a huge army of zombies. For a while, it's pretty cool to see. Our remaining heroes take down legions of undead using various weapons and fancy fighting moves but the scene drags on and on. It begins by being kind of cool (maybe because before then you were falling asleep) then becomes ridiculous and funny and finally ends by being totally boring.\n\nEven the ending of the movie ends in a big WTF moment that doesn't really make any sense. Even if you had the lowest standards imaginable, and I have been known to exhibit this illness, and basic zombie action with frequent moments of \"girls gone wild\" type nudity would interest you, the plot is so badly written, so poorly acted that there is no way you can enjoy yourself. I laughed at a moment where a party goer refused to go skinny dipping with a hot woman just so he could get killed by a zombie but like so many of Uwe Boll's films, you can't even enjoy this film ironically. It was a chore to get through and while I can, once again, praise the special effects, the surrounding story is terrible and you shouldn't waste your time with \"House of the Dead\".

There may be some novelty value in its awfulness but apart from that House of the Dead is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. It looks cheap, with fake-looking gore and terrible effects. Not to mention that it is like the third film I've seen in a row with some of the worst camera work I've ever seen in any movie. The lighting is ineffective also, even for a movie of this genre it is too austere, and the scenery I just couldn't enjoy as a result. The music is loud and over-bearing, starting sluggish in tempo and then rushing on for no real reason. The script is full of overlong and quite frankly lazy exposition, repetitive rhetoric and dialogue that comes across as hackneyed and trite. The pop culture references especially feel thrown in and add absolutely nothing to the actually non-existent atmosphere The story is a mess, what there is is predictable and lethargic with nothing standing out as scary or suspenseful, a lot of it reads of a rambling music video with a cheap attempt to evoke some horror. The direction is incompetent, not surprising considering it's Uwe Boll, whose reputation for making bad movies is notorious. The characters are stereotypical, have absolutely no depth to them and are not likable at all, more annoying above all else. The acting ranges from bland to irritating, nothing better. There are some nice-looking people that unfortunately can't do anything with what they've been given. All in all, simply terrible, a must avoid if preferable. 1/10 Bethany Cox"

The actors look bored, and the filmmakers clearly have no respect for their audience - this is obvious from the way that the real life action is interspersed with footage from the video game on which this is based - almost as if they think the audience are so moronic that unless it is made explicit that this is based on a game they will not comprehend it. I almost didn't because the game was actually great fun and there is nothing fun at all about this film!"

This film was pretty much a MTV video with zombies. It's a movie based from a game. The film was not scary at all. The head villain is just a left over act from the film Hellraisers.

        "review_detailed_main": "The only horror to this movie is that it was unleashed on the public. I knew before I watched it that it was going to be a bad movie. I knew that movies based on video games very rarely translate well to movies, and I had heard that this was a stinker among stinkers. Somehow, Uwe Boll managed to lower the bar right to the ground. Ignore ANY review of this movie that is not a 1 (unless someday they let you choose 0).\n\nHorrible acting. Cheesy effects. No story.\n\nNo matter how bad you think I'm telling you this movie is, it's worse than you are expecting.\n\nEdit: After further reading and comtemplation, I wanted to express a little more about this movie.\n\nFirst, there are people that have stated this movie does not belong in the bottom 100 movies. I'm not sure how they can make that an argument for grading this movie higher than it is really worth. Have they actually seen every single movie listed? I know I haven't. I don't care where my rating of this movie makes it fall in some list. All I can tell you is that the movie does not even deserve its current, artificially inflated, score.\n\nSecond, the ONLY people that should view this film are film students. I think this movie would make an excellent educational tool for first-year film students so that they can get a VERY clear idea of what NOT to do.\n\nFinally, thinking more about the content of the movie, the best way to describe it is if you put a 9-year old at the helm. Imagine a young person spewing out, \"You know what would be cool?! That spinning camera effect from The Matrix! And little clips of the video game! Oh, Oh! And a weapons dealer! That would be so cool!\" Essentially, that is what this movie is. The unedited \"cool\" list of a 9-year old. The problem is, the movie has nudity and extreme violence, so no 9-year old should ever see this movie."

If you don't believe me, do a web search on his name and look for the petitions to force him to stop working.\n\nANOTHER BAD THING: This movie is so poorly conceived and executed that it not only notoriously splices clips of the original video game source material into the live action footage, but also accidentally reveals the device used to launch actors during an explosion made famous by the \"A-Team.\"\n\nEVEN ANOTHER BAD THING: This flick gives zombies a bad name. By relying on the undead as nothing more than monster targets for shotgun blasts, the movie never delves into issues of mindlessness and animal-like behavior explored by better film makers (see: \"Dawn of the Dead\" or \"28 Days/Weeks Later\").\n\nONE GOOD THING: Featuring perennial horror favorites Jurgen Prochnow and Clint Howard; as well as, atrocious dialog and attractive women in revealing situations, the movie is ripe for drinking games and \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" type commentary.\n\nOVERALL GRADE: F\n\nBETTER MOVIES LIKE IT: Evil Dead II (1987), Army of Darkness (1992), Dawn of the Dead (1998 & 2004), Braindead (1992), Night of the Living Dead (1968), 28 Days Later (2002), 28 Weeks Later (2007)."

        "review_detailed_main": "The House of the Dead is a lackluster attempt to capitalize on the huge success of the classic zombie-bashing House of the Dead video game by Sega Inc. Sure, if you are an inexperienced directing and writing team, you can point at the success of Resident Evil (Resident Evil 2 forthcoming) and Mortal Kombat movies. I'll bet the project was further justified by the huge revenue generated by this title for game systems and in the arcade. However, unlike RE and MK, HofD is merely a button- mashing or trigger-pulling video game. The game lacks storyline depth and this movie does as well. The problem is that a video game is a video game and a movie is a movie, period!!! For example, one of the zombie-killing scenes in the movie goes on and on and on, while characters twirl in circles waiting to be your chosen player for game play. The problem is you're not playing a video game, next scene please. Why are people kissing in this movie when the writers didn't develop the characters or the storyline enough to justify such nonsense. Makes me wonder-How could the teen-slasher formula be so badly interpreted? Sega logos in the background?, it's not a commercial. Special features? pure space-fillers. For example, why would the women of HofD need to train to kill zombies, when even in the movie they are simply pulling the trigger. What a joke!!! SEGA's apparent motto--LETS GET OUR NAME OUT THERE IN A MOVE, WE'RE SEGA. If you want to waste time rent this movie, if not, most of the other horror movies in the horror section of the video store are better than this, even the mindless slashers."

There is one fight scene, in which they have to fight their way into a mysterious and/or creepy looking castle thing, and even though it is only a short walk it takes them about ten minutes to fight their way there, they kill countless zombies, and yet when there is a wide shot, there are relatively no bodies on the ground. Another humorous thing is to watch some of the special features, it is funny because everyone in the movie is actually taking it seriously, I was shocked. Not to mention that the blonde actress isn't really an actress at all, because she is exactly the same as her retarded on screen counter-part. Uwe Bol will certainly do down in history as the worst director of all time, which is good news for Ed Wood, incidentally. The cinematography is so cheesy and stupid, it looks like something a seven year old concocted, and the music, dear sweet Jesus god, don't even get me started on how great the music was. It was so bad, that it added to the humor of the movie. I love this movie.

HoD had potential but the director and actors give up on this doomed venture before it started.\n\nMy grade: 4/10! A few decent scenes saved this one from 1/10!\n\nNote to Hollywood Part 3: Some studio spent $12 million on this, shame on you. You should have financed Romero's 4th Dead flick."

If you can't enjoy Cheesy B flicks like that, then don't go.\n\nIf you're the kind who quotes the \"Romero Bible\", don't go. Zombies aren't limited by rules, only the limits of your imagination.\n\nAs corny as you might find that, it may be the best way to enjoy this very flawed movie. HotD is, at best, a Roger Corman/Sci-Fi channel type of film. Bad cheese, but I've seen worse.\n\nBest reason to watch: Jurgen Prochnow and Ellie Cornell. They have the most dignified characters, the most common sense, and the best lines. They also have the best death scenes (If you're into that kind of critiquing) Kira, Will and Ona really try, but the script fails them and the other cast members\n\nThe music wasn't so bad, and the action scenes kicked butt. I can tolerate the arcade stuff added in. It's not that annoying if you simply accept this as an Arcade action flick and not a horror film. I wanted to see the gang kick zombie butt, and I got my money's worth.\n\nWorst elements: The script dialogue. Ellie and Jurgen get the best lines. Otherwise, there is not an ounce of wit or clever banter.\n\nRudy is the worst Hero since Stephen Dorff's cop from \"Fear Dot Com\" and Jared Leto's Paul from \"Urban Legends\". Casper and Kirk SHOULD have been the main characters since they at least TRIED to save everybody, while Rudy just stares at his current girlfriend getting ripped to shreds.\n\nSloppy editing. Stupid teen antics.\n\nBIGGEST mistake in the whole film is to have Rudy open the movie with the lines \"If they hadn't come, they'd still be alive\". This has killed any suspense of seeing who survives in the end!\n\nI don't think it's a terrible film, despite my comments. It's a Cheesy B flick, nothing more. But I do HOPE that Uwe Boll and Mark Altman LEARN from these flaws. A sequal is in the planning stages, which may be better than the first if they write and shoot a more clever script"

This... this 'thing' you called a movie isn't really a movie, it's like a music video. A very long music video with a thin plot and laughable characters. So I have an idea for you. Instead of calling yourself a director, and saying you make movies, you can call yourself a 'thing-maker', and just say you make things. Because I will be perfectly honest with you, they sure aren't movies.\n\nSeveral times while watching this 'thing', I asked myself if you were really there with the actors, directing it, or if you walked away and took a coffee break, took a day off, or, perhaps, went on vacation. You certainly have money to take a break, because the production companies are handing you money to make these 'things'.\n\nSee, you accept scripts that have NOTHING to do with the storyline of the video game itself. It's a difficult task, I know. But when you make things like this that has a fan base, you have to take a care that you don't alienate that fan base. If there isn't enough of a budget, then I suggest you don't make the 'thing', or perhaps do something else constructive with the small budget that you have. Because actors that have no idea how to act, redundant special effects, and general chaos of a crapped on script just doesn't bring in the audience, Uwe. Also, splicing in scenes of the Sega video game that your 'thing' is based on was a bad idea. The real problem comes when we see these video game clips over and over again, like as if they made your thing better.\n\nI'll give your thing a 2, Uwe. There were some OK splatter-gore scenes, and yes, you did tell several of your actresses to take off their clothes. And that's all I could say about your 'thing', because there are other filmmakers that make low budget horror films that are much better at doing sex and violence.\n\nNow, please stop making your 'things'."

Python\" back to back on my VCR and had a decent time). But \"House of the Dead\" made me hit my gag limit early on. How early? Try five minutes into the film.\n\nSo every day or so, I'd go back and try to watch some more of it from my Tivo, and every time I'd quit in disgust within 3-5 minutes. I kept expecting it to get better somehow, or at least watchable, but it started out as pure crap and never wavered in its unwinking commitment to a level of suck rarely seen in professionally made movies. Eventually I managed to finish it (talk about misguided consumer masochism). And I just have to say...\n\nUwe Boll is a phenomenally bad director. Just awful. It's obvious that he didn't really give the cast any real direction at all. He just left them out there on their own without a clue, and the results are like watching a first time 'reader's theater' walk-through of the working script. Not one single line of dialog worked. Not one scene was watchable. Not one story element made sense. Not once did the camera work and cinematography do anything but clumsily (and unsuccessfully) ape the ideas and techniques of other, far better movies. Not once did the plot engage my interest. Not once did I feel fear, shock, suspense, anxiety or interest in any of the characters. Timing, rhythm, story arc, character development, believable character reactions, consistent story structure or even decent SFX...\"House Of The Dead\" cares not for such things.\n\nAnd just to throw a final spadeful of dirt onto the grave, some genius decided to edit actual game footage from the original \"House Of the Dead\" game in the middle of some the action footage, a disastrous aesthetic choice that jams the incompetence of the proceedings into the audiences' faces like a hot-tar dermabrasion.\n\nThe only reason this movie gets more than a \"1\" is because Jurgen Prochnow is in it and \"Das Boot\" was so great that I can't bear to give a \"1\" (or a \"0\") to something he was involved with.\n\nNot only can I not understand why Boll is allowed to go on making movies...I can't understand why audiences who paid money to see this abomination didn't riot and burn down the theaters. The producers must have arranged to sneak roofies into the oil on the buttered popcorn."

Then imagine that they secured financing by agreeing to turn their epic into a 90 minute commercial for the game.\n\nWe know we're in trouble when a giant SEGA banner fills the frame early on in what passes for \"the story.\" But the stomach chunks don't really start blowing until the action intensifies and -- shazaam! -- we are blasted by the editor from the derivatively staged cinematic action directly into snippets of the video game.\n\nIt occurred to me halfway through this stinker that it was about as much fun as watching a couple of friends play a video game. But minutes later I realized that it wasn't even that much fun. In this case, the player is the director, and his directorial choices stank like baked ass.\n\nThe writers deserve their share of the credit as well. To say the characters are one dimensional would be generous. My guess is that no one involved in this movie had ever seen a horror movie, let alone could pass as a fan. It has all the hallmarks of pretension one could expect from creators who are slumming in the genre.\n\nThere is one bright moment early on, when a nubile beauty takes a topless swim. For one teasing moment it seems that we're about to be thrust into a retro horrorsploitation flick, the kind of no holds barred teen hormone catalyzer they used to make before \"Scream\" laid the future foundation for a kinder, gentler, more pc kind of horror flick.\n\nBut that moment passes quickly, and the mess that follows is a chore to endure. The zombies are as uninteresting as the rest of the cast. (Note to Jurgen: get a new agent! Fast!) The \"kids\" in this movie run the full gamut from underacting to overacting. In their defense, it's probable that the producers and director were following an agenda to target this movie to ten-year-old game fans, so any acting which might have led to actual scares or suspense was probably actively squelched.\n\nClint Howard in Gorton Fisherman drag stands out. As demented and lopsidedly comedic as his character is, at least there's a spark of life in him.\n\nThe zombies attack. Guns start blazing. The soundtrack kicks in with what can only be tagged \"trance hop.\" Too leaden and simple-minded to be trip hop, it amps up the monotony factor tenfold. When the editor isn't lopping in ill-advised bits of pixelated game action, the director is injecting slow-motion whirly-whirl nuggets which instantly remind the viewer that the Matrix did it first, and did it in a much smarter context.\n\nIf you're tempted to rent this, pick up \"House of 1000 Corpses\" instead. Even if you've already seen it."

If it was actually worth it is definitely questionable, but, I did manage to get some good laughs and a new Top Worst Film of All Time.\n\nSo, let's get this out of the way. Uwe Boll's House of the Dead lives up to the hype. It really is the worst (zombie) movie ever made. I cannot stress that enough really...it IS pure crap. Honestly, the only thing this movie is good for is unintentional laughs or a good nap. I found myself dozing off in a few of the action scenes as they were just plain boring. (And for some reason I decided to rewind some of them to see if I missed out on story\u0085whoops! Bad mistake there)! The acting is atrocious, the score is beyond annoying (seriously, techno beats throughout the whole movie??), the story is almost non-existent, the characters are unbelievable and unlikeable (we get nil development and all stupidity) and the special effects are appalling.\n\nFor those who have no idea what House of the Dead is about, it is only fair to fill you in. Based off the popular rail-shooting arcade games, this follows a group of teens who are trying to get to a rave on an island. They miss their scheduled boat by 15 minutes, so they pay a smuggler to take them there. Upon arrival, they discover everyone is gone and the place is trashed. Do they leave? Nope, they stay for the free beer and to wander around in groups. They soon discover the island is infested with zombies, so they take refuge in a house and try survive the night.\n\nI do not know what could have been going through Boll's brain (if it exists) when he was making this. Shouldn't a smart, normal human realise they are making a bad movie when your teenage ravers can shoot shotguns, desert eagles and sub-machine guns with 100% precision and accuracy? Oh, and they can also perform high level martial arts! Shouldn't an intelligent man know its a bad movie when your action scenes directly rip-off \"The Matrix\" with poor CGI and dodgy slo-mo? Finally, how the holy $#*& can someone think inserting game footage into the movie makes it better? I am not joking when I say this, Boll actually includes numerous clips from the game during the action scenes and even includes a Game Over screenshot when one of the ravers dies! House of the Dead is consistently good at being absolute trite. With zombies that look identical (and are able to swim, sword-fight and get angered by breaking tanks full of red water), with bullets igniting barrels of gunpowder and with the power to get stabbed and die, but get up and crush a zombie's head only to die again, Uwe Boll has successfully created the most idiotic film in history. The movie is funny, though, and many could find joy at laughing at the many plot holes and clich\u00e9s abundant throughout. Moreover, the random nudity may please some\u0085 Congratulations, Mr. Boll, you have managed to rape what could have been at least a mediocre movie! 0/5"

The difference between this movie and the game is quite noticeable, although I try to be a prequel to the video game. Even so, Uwe manages to create something totally reprehensible for fans of the game, but in the end it is an entertaining movie that deserves to be considered cult, since Uwe's goal was to create such a movie. He succeeded in it even though it is a bad adaptation. House Of The Dead stands out quite a bit among many failed adaptations and that makes it an interesting and enjoyable movie. My rating for this movie is 7/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Like getting a vat of molten metal poured all over your body, \"House of the Dead\" is a very, very bad, painful experience.\n\nA group of hip young teens decide to go to a mysterious island for the \"rave of the century\". Too bad they missed the party, everyone on the island has joined the legion of the undead. The teens, along with a gun-slinging seaman, must fight for survival against the zombies. What follows is a night of loud music, MTV-style photography, and a helluvalot of exploding zombie heads.\n\nSeriously folks, this has got to be one of the most\u0085upsetting, film experience I've ever sat through. Where do the problems start? Probably with director Uwe Boll, whose film-making skills are non-existent. Someone needs to slap this guy across the face for this mess. I don't get it, did he really think bullet-time shots and slow-motion shoot-out scenes impress us? There's no suspense, the \"dramatic\" scenes are real eye-rollers (Thankfully though you always know their coming when the sappy piano music starts up), and the pacing\u0097the graveyard scene went on for what seemed like half a freakin' hour!\n\nThe bad writing is no helping matter. The characters are 1-D and frankly quite stupid, the only likable person here being Jurgen Prochnow as captain Kirk (Get it!?!? Get it!?!? Captain humor?!?! Funny!!!) who spent virtually the entire movie shooting zombies left and right (Conveniently, his character smuggled and endless arsenal of illegal fire power onto the island).\n\nActing? Like everything else here, pretty bad, Mr. Prochnow aside. The script may be a factor here to, but bad acting is still bad acting. Oh, and the woman playing the coast guard (name escapes me right now) was especially awful.\n\nSo what you fan boy's been waiting for\u0097the gore. Yep, it's here, most of it involving zombies and not humans (most of the death scenes are disappointingly off-screen). We get exploding heads, limbs flying, bloody gun-shot wounds, and more. There were also lots of zombies (but I guess that's a given since this is billed as a zombie movie). Problem is, none of these effects are particularly good. In fact, some of them were hilarious. The zombies are mostly brought to life with stiff-looking prosthetics, with the occasional unconvincing rod puppet thrown in for measures. Hey, I'd prefer the good IL' make-up effects over crappy CG any day, but the effects are still disappointingly weak.\n\nThe flaws are hilarious and too numerous to into with great detail. My favorite is when (spoiler alert!) the house explodes and we get a slow-motion shot of the front door exploding off its hinges. Literally two scenes later\u0097yep, you guessed it\u0097the door is back on, and in perfect shape. Not even singed by flames. Good continuity on that one!\n\nThis is a bad, bad movie, so bad in fact that between the direct-to-video production values and the rancid script, its hard to tell what's worse. See it only, and I mean only, if your goal in life is to see every bad movie out there.\n\nA well deserved 1/10."

The production instincts are reliably 180 degrees misaligned; it's not so much inept as inspired, in the sense that nobody could deliberately fashion a movie so awkward and off-key. I just can't believe that--this must be the doing of an idiot- savant. I don't find fault with the actors (who deliver inane lines with brio) or have much to criticize on technical grounds. There's always enough going on to keep you watching while they're setting up the next howler of a scene, and any such expectation is never disappointed.\n\nThis is an uncompromising, take-it-or-leave-it work of a singular artistic vision and bizarro genius. Judging it as a video game adaptation, or horror flick or whatever, is beside the point. In the right frame of mind you can't go wrong with this hilarious movie. But it's the little things that really make the difference, e.g. when suddenly the name of the raver-girl character, whose costume is patterned after an American flag, is revealed for the first time to be \"Liberty,\" after she's attacked by a monster late in the story (Guy: \"No!!! Liberty!!!! NOOOOOO!!!!\"). Minus one star cuz it needed more scenes with Uwe Boll in the Gorton's fisherman's outfit."

I mean, WOW, I didn't know it was possible to throw as much money as they obviously did at something and still come out worse than ANY Roger Corman movie! Corman was probably pitched this movie at some point but declined due to the poor quality of the script! The only reason this movie got made in the first place is that someone said, 'Hey, Zombies are popular. Video games are popular. What game can we get a hold of that has zombies in it? Resident Evil? No, someone else got there first. Silent Hill? No, too silent. People will never sit in a dark room just to be scared silly. Hey, didn't Sega have a game where people ran around shooting zombies? They're out of the platform biz, we could get that for pennies!'\n\nBasically they tried their best to make a movie that felt like the video game, even down to shooting the combat as if the characters were actually playing the game.\n\nThe first and major problem is that the original game was horrid. I mean,\n\nbad-movie-merchandising-made-into-a-worse-game-in-two-weeks-and-then-shippe d-out-and-bought-by-morons-and-their-parents-for-christmas horrid. The graphics were boring. The monsters were boring. The levels were boring. The interface was boring. The CASE was boring. In other words, this was a boring game. And that was the ARCADE version. The home version was even worse! With the home version, you didn't even get the shotgun to hold in your hand while you were being bored silly by this pointless game! But I digress.\n\nThe second problem is that they went so far as to actually intercut scenes from actual gameplay during the fight scenes. HUH??? Didn't the editor have enough confidence in the effects to indicate that there was an actual fight going on? Not to mention that EVERY fight was shot from the perspective of a video game, which may explain the tedious use of Matrix-style effects. The problem with this is that the game was a first-person shooter (the player proceeds from the POV of the character). Maybe that's why they put in the game graphics, to let you know that they were alluding to the game... Right, whatever...\n\nAnyway, the only thing that made this ENTIRE experience remotely enjoyable was the fact that everyone in the theatre was making fun of the movie out loud, so my sudden fits of hysterical laughter and general incredulity were taken as commonplace and didn't get me kicked out.\n\nTo sum up, DON'T GO SEE THIS MOVIE! Don't even deign to rent it when it comes out on video in a couple of week. Run. Just run."

OK i do admit the acting is sometimes a bit plastic and silly and there is some unnecessary nudity in there but this is a decent film that is worth a rent just for the action scene. this is a 15 in the UK and an R in the us because there is gore, swearing and nudity so it isn't recommended for kids but if you want a good zombie film then check this out."

As much of a hack work Hell of the Living Dead is, it's a masterpiece compared to House of the Dead. Tired cinematography reused under the guise of a fresh hip living dead movie. The only surprise the movie held was the appearance of Jurgen Prochnow, a favorite of mine from Dune and Das Boot. He seems to walk through the role which is an extended Das Boot joke anyway and has smackings of 'did it for the money' all over him. House of the Dead is no masterpiece and has several shortcomings but is not the worst zombie movie I've ever seen. It just failed to add anything to the genre of note."

Of course, there's \"Manos: The Hands of Fate,\" which is also a horror film; however, \"Manos\" was more of a comedy and a disaster rather than a really spooky horror film (because the man had no budget, the plot and story was weak, etc.) However, thanks to my handy-dandy-trusty calculating device of mine, $7,000,000 (how much it cost to make \"House of the Dead\") divided by a measly little $19,000 (how much it cost to make \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\") equals approximately 368.42105263157894736842105263158. So really, \"House of the Dead\" was about 368.42105263157894736842105263158 times more expensive than \"Manos\" to make. Judging between the two, \"House of the Dead\" is the better choice for a bad horror film."

The House of the Dead games are widely considered having of the worst acting found in any video game series period. The House of the Dead games were rail-gun shooters, where you would shoot lot's of zombies with bits of plot about. They were amazing, but their story bits were also shamelessly (intentionally?) poorly done.\n\nThis film is actually pretty entetaining as a weirdo horror film goes. The acting is bad, but that's okay because it's campy, and the action is over-the-top but well-shot. The story is cheesy, but that's on par with the source material.\n\nJust look at this way. If they made a truly good film based off the House of the Dead games, it would be a bad adaptation. Go on Youtube.com and look up video-footage of House of the Dead 2. I swear that the actors are foreigners reading transliterations!"

Finally, towards the end are a series of quick shots intended to be flashbacks (which are very likely to induce epileptic seizures) and too trendy techno music for a horror movie. Poorly timed love scenes add to the simple horror of having to watch this movie. Did I mention the poor acting?"

A terribly acted voice-over tries to explain the main characters, but it's not really stated why they're significant, or where they came from. The guy, Rudy, does mention that one of the characters is his ex-girlfriend, and that she enjoys fencing for no reason at all. This is obviously just a set up to give an explanation to why she can sword fight in a future battle scene. Does writing get any worse than this?. The rest of the movie pretty much takes place on the island. A cut to the island shows pre zombie ravers drinking beer, dancing, and doing' the dirty. I think it also goes without saying that there is, of course, shameless random nudity galore.\n\nThe camera angles are terrible as well. Cut-aways are used almost every minute, and I could've sworn I saw the same shot of running zombies thirteen times. I really think the director had a thing for slow-motion crab shots too. Pretty much every shot in the action sequences featured a character in the middle of the shot while the camera spun around them \"Matrix style\".\n\nThe music wasn't anything special, as it was mostly mainstream rock music blared throughout every fight scene and underlayed with repetitive gunshots. The picture quality was also sub-par. It varied from Panavision niceness, to grainy, blurry, and over-exposed ugliness.\n\nIs there anything good about it all? Well, let's see...it's in focus but even then it might have been enjoyable out of focus so we would not see what was going on. So on a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being awful and 10 being great I give House of the Dead a 1."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is a prequel to all of the The House of the Dead video games. Set on an island off the coast of Florida, a techno rave party attracts a diverse group of college coeds and a Coast Guard officer. Soon, they discover that their X-laced escapades are to be interrupted by zombies and monsters that attack them on the ground, from the air, and in the sea, ruled by an evil entity in the House of the Dead...\n\nHouse of the Dead is a popular video game in the arcade, not so much on the home console. Many video game titles aren't very good, Mario Bros, Resident Evil and Tomb Raider failed to please the fans of those games. House of the Dead manages to do something that those films were not able to do. Displease every single person who has ever heard of it.\n\nUwe Boll is known as the video game filmmaker, after tackling this project and the equally \"brilliant\" Alone in the Dark, Boll's future projects include Bloodrayne, FarCry and Postal. All of which are video games. Who will get the unfortunate pleasure of being presented to us through the vision of Uwe Boll. It amazes me that this man still finds work today. Why people think he can bring video games to the screen is beyond me because he doesn't bring them to life, he kills them before they even get a chance.\n\nNow onto the film that is known as House of the Dead, well where do I start? There are no redeeming factors of this film. Not the cameo appearance of Clint Howard can save this, not even nudity from random young beautiful women. Uwe Boll somehow manages to take nudity/violence/horror/action/special effects and actually hurt a movie. These things are suppose to make them entertaining.\n\nThe film for god know's why has random images from the actual video game in the film. Every time before a death I believe we see someone playing the game. I do not understand the reason behind this. Is Boll intentionally trying to tick off North America....maybe even the word? None of the characters are likable. The Chinese woman who wears American themed spandex jumps into the \"undead\" infested water to save the life of a man she met literally 5 seconds ago. She screams his name as if they were best friends.\n\nYou can't forget the fact that every single one of these party people are able to pick up and fire a weapon, with 100% accuracy by the way. Can't forget the cool looking stances while shooting them. Well, if you call jumping up in the air with a shotgun a cool looking thing to do. Boll probably thought to himself, how can I make my film cooler...well, let's throw in that thing the matrix did, and now every other action movie is doing. Bullet Time. Horrendous.\n\nThe film ultimately makes absolutely no sense what-so-ever to the viewer, or even those people involved. Everything bad that you've heard about this film is true, but even worse. It goes down in history as one of those movie that you want to smash to bits with whatever weapon you can find but then think to yourself that it doesn't even deserve that. You end up hating yourself for even watching it, or even thinking about watching it.\n\nHouse of the Dead is a horror movie that has no horror and too much action, It turns from horror to horror-ble. The make-up effects, well...look as if a 12 year old kid painted. Something that they would wear out or Halloween. It's a film like this that make you wonder why it got a theatrical release, or why it would even be considered for a direct to video release. It makes you wonder if you can come up with something better yourself, then you go to the bathroom and actually come up with something better...unfortunately you have to flush that down."

These zombies however move incredibly quickly and there's an overwhelming swarm of them. The film is peppered with naked beauties, bullet ballets, a pounding electronic score and some fairly decent martial arts by a cute Asian character named Liberty. And there's one brilliant sequence showing one character's rapidly cut remembrance of the entire evening's happenings. However none of this is enough to completely cover for the lazy script, substandard acting and the not so special effects."

However, I especially loved how every character knew how to use high-tech guns and must have spent their lives playing nothing but Area 51. 'Cause none of them ever missed a shot.

I also enjoyed the several shots of topless women. Hey, it's a horror flick, it has to fulfill its quota. The acting is wooden and far from great, but it's not bad either. Veteran actors Clint Howard and Jurgen Prochnow help add some class to the predominantly young cast. If you get your hands on the DVD, it has a good commentary by the cast and crew. The German director, Uwe Boll, has a very good sense of humor and doesn't bore you with pretentious details, like some directors do.\n\nMy score: 5 (out of 10)"

This lame excuse for a horror movie is annoyance from start to finish with ridiculous characters, boisterous nu-metal music and awfully cinematographed gore. Empty-headed, ravishing looking teenagers (read: bimbo-chicks wearing hot thongs and an overload of cleavage and hormone-driven boys) set sail to a deserted island to go wild at a rave.

The awfulness of House of the Dead goes far beyond bad script problems. Footage from the stupid video game is edited into the film, with an incredibly negative effect as a result! Director Uwe Boll (what's in a name\u0085) didn't made no horror film! He just shot a long promotional campaign to praise a meaningless, violent video game!

I should have known\u0085every film in which Clint Howard stars soon turns out to be a stinker. That must be this guy's birthright or something. J\u00fcrgen Prochnow reached an absolute low in his career with this, too. No matter how you look at it: House of the Dead is an absolute stinker! I respect everyone's opinion on movies but if you, by any chance, would think highly of this piece of crap, you're just plain wrong."

        "review_detailed_main": "I had no idea this was based on a video game until I started watching it. So I guess I'm not included in the video game fan category for this movie.\n\nI'm not one to give away any of the plot, and basically you don't need to know about the plot to see a zombie flick, but the zombies in this movie are not generic randomly raised zombies. There's a possibility that some of these zombies are 400-500 years old.\n\nThe zombies in this movie do not need to be shot in the head to be killed. Unlike older traditional zombie flicks, these zombies move quick (like in 28 Days later) but are quite a bit more methodical. As well they can use melee weapons. Certainly some of the most vicious zombies around.\n\nOna Grauer was overwhelmingly sexy throughout the film. J\u00fcrgen Prochnow is excellent in his role. Ellie Cornell didn't seem comfortable in her role, but it doesn't take away from the movie and she did well in the action scenes. Clint Howard played his part well, and while the character was somewhat useful in the plot (certainly the whistling scenes were good additions), the character was mostly annoying (likely a writer/director flaw, not the actor's). The others were all quite adequate and each had something good to add to the flick. They should all be able to get more work easily.\n\nIt's no blockbuster but is certainly an entertaining zombie flick. A bunch of nobodies become excellent zombie destroyers. It has some really nifty clips that circle the characters which was very well done (and hopefully not overly copied into other movies like the Matrix effect).\n\nThe action clips were far more realistic than most modern action movies. Slow motion dodges by the martial artist actually followed the rules of physics and weren't done with any big special effects (No running up trees here or ridiculous bending over backwards so your head can tap the floor and back up). The stop action and slow-motion was very well placed and not overused.\n\nThere are numerous video game clips in the movie which sorely take away from the movie and were a really bad idea. As well the narration isn't spoken clearly. Oh,and don't count the bullets fired - they won't add up.\n\nCertainly this movie has more energy and flow then most zombie movies. It doesn't have much creepiness though. This is more of a fun zombie action movie than a horror flick.Think of it as the first Resident Evil without the slower spots. This is pretty non-stop action.\n\nFrom a mainstream movie point of view, there will be some silly aspects to this movie, but from a B-Movie-Zombie-flick point of view, it should be in any zombie collection.\n\nThe actual premise and deeper plot of the movie has quite a bit of potential. Certainly more could have been made with the plot, but it was fun nevertheless.\n\nI'll buy it."

Uwe Boll you are terrible and you really had a cornucopia of things hand wrapped and given out to you, but you had to do it your way didn't you? But I still cannot get over how terrifically mental it is to not have G and Rogan be main characters. Instead you had to take a bunch of idiot teenagers that we aren't attached because they are so unlikable, and then you screw up the race of which G is. YOU COULDN'T EVEN GET THAT TINY LITTLE PART RIGHT! This was a golden opportunity to expand the HOTD universe and add on to the classic game. It was a chance to make thousands of HOTD fans become proud that there favorite game series was picking up and expanding more. But this is just a smear of trash, making sega curse the day they made the game and making people curse the day they ever picked up one of the classic arcade guns. This film blows. Bad dialogue, scenes, acting, editing, and most of all directing."

It's like the cinematic equivalent of a 200 car freeway pileup. The characters are shallow, one-dimensional, corny, annoying, and generally unlikeable. I didn't care about a single one of them. The actors portraying these ridiculous characters seem to have been given no direction whatsoever, they just stumble their way through the movie trying to make the best of the horror script. The story is dumb, hardly explained, and makes little to no sense. The cinematography is actually not bad at times and the production values are adequate, it's just a shame these aspects didn't go into a better project. Uwe Boll fancies himself as some sort of brilliant auteur who the critics just happen to pick on for personal reasons. It's nothing personal, Mr. Boll. It's your work.\n\n1/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is the worst zombie movie I've ever seen and one of the worst movies of all time. Directed by the infamous Uwe Boll, this train wreck of a movie is full of unintentional laughs, plot holes, silly dialogues and awful acting. Every aspect of the movie is completely disastrous and it's safe to say that House of the Dead has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The constant referencing to other, better movies (Jaws, Rain Man, LOTR, The Elephant Man, Matrix\u0085) doesn't help either. Also, I don't understand how J\u00fcrgen Prochnow, the star of the great classic movie Das Boot, landed a role in this pile of nonsense. The name of his character is Kirk, and he is a captain. I'm not kidding you.\n\nAnyway, House of the Dead is based on an arcade game of the same name. I'm not familiar with the game but I'm going to guess that the movie's plot is in no way connected to the game's storyline \u2013 something so inane as this movie's synopsis could only exist in an Uwe Boll movie. Since it's based on a game, Uwe Boll, for some reason, decided to put video clips from the original game into the movie, 32 of them. As a result, the movie's action is often interrupted by the video game clips. I don't know why would anyone in their right mind do such a thing, but that only proves that Uwe Boll has the directing abilities of a mentally challenged monkey. Back to the plot: a group of friends want to get to a rave party on an island named the Island of Death. They are somehow late for the boat that is supposed to take them there, so they pay a big amount of money to a suspicious captain who does. When they arrive, they notice no one is there and the spot were the party was meant to take place is covered in blood. Nonetheless, they decide to get drunk and have sex.\n\nIt's noteworthy to mention that the protagonist and the narrator of the story (whose opening narration kind of spoils the movie) doesn't show up until a half an hour into the movie. Not only is the protagonist a problem \u2013 the antagonist is atrocious as well. The villain is an immortal Spanish priest named Castillo who, by using some mutated blood (this is never fully resolved), resurrects the dead. His actions, goals and motivations are never thoroughly explained. Of course, there is the scene where a character asks him why did he become immortal. To live forever!, Castillo replies. This exchange of unintentionally hilarious dialogue is as far as Castillo's development goes.\n\nIn the third act of the movie, there is an action sequence which runs for about 10 minutes or so (in case you're interested, the duration of the whole movie is 90 minutes). This sequence could have been OK, if it weren't for the aforementioned video game clips interrupting it and for the disgraceful editing. Eventually, House of the Dead ends just like it started \u2013 as a messy train wreck of a movie that should be ignored for the rest of eternity.\n\nRating: 1/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/"

The shoot'm up zombie fest with loud teenage almost rap and Matrix stills buy the score was fun.

I guess you look for the gang of quietly sticky zombies accidentally some poor lamb of a human - usually looking the wrong way for suspense. Well these zombies where a bit louder and they seemed to seek prey, but there were Grade A Hollywood tits all over the house and proudly displayed - so I gotta give back a point or two if you see it \"au natural\" - but if you see it with the tits hacked out for TV - then you have a 3."

        "review_detailed_main": "House of the Dead is based on the Sega game of the same name. I have never played the game myself but this movie doesn't do very much in the way of persuading one to give it a chance. The story is as follows. A group sets out to go to a Rave party on an isolated island and in their first but not last act of stupidity during the course of the film they miss the boat that was to take them. They coax a cigar smuggling boat owner to give them a ride to the island by giving him $1000. 500 to get there and 500 to get back. With all that cash floating around, the group should have skipped the Rave and went and brought some brains. Well, they get to the island and to sum the rest of the film up, there is a lot of running around, screaming, breasts jiggling, tired and I do mean tired stereotypes of every character, especially the Asian character. That was just ridiculous. Uwe Boll must think that the Matrix is the greatest movie of all time because he uses the camera tricks from that film all throughout the battle sequences, which mind you dragged on way too long. And if all of that wasn't bad enough, Uwe Boll has spliced actual game-play action into the movie. He seemed to think it added to the film, even if the scenes from the game didn't always match up with the live action. I don't even have to mention awful dialog and acting because I can forgive those nuances. They can almost be so bad they're entertaining, but some things I just can't forgive. How Uwe Boll ever got anyone to support him in this film is beyond my comprehension.\n\n3/10 Don't waste your time. I'd recommend it to hardcore B movie fans like myself. But if you don't appreciate making fun of movies then don't submit yourself to this torture."

You felt absolutely no connection to the characters and wished that they all died quickly so that the movie could just end. The dead corpses acted better than the main cast.\n\nI never felt a chill in this movie. It's not even remotely scary. I don't know what they were thinking with the arcade game \"house of the dead\" cut scenes every 5 minutes. A total mood killer.\n\nIt just seems like they didn't even try with this movie. They just thought that blasting zombies would be enough to keep everyone happy. Guess again. The movie is cheesy, clich\u00e9, and just god awful. Its not even funny how bad it is.

        "review_detailed_main": "The only review of this one I really read was one on Ain't it Cool news (a site I'm trying to break the habit of visiting) where the guy simply repeated the words \"sucked\" over and over again.\n\nWhile I kept that in mind as i rented this one, you should keep something else in mind before you read this.\n\n1. I love zombie movies. Yes, I'm one of those guys. Zombie films like Dawn of the Dead and Lucio Fulci's Zombie were part of my initial education of the horror genra back in 1997. It's a genra that apart from a few hiccups, had been dormant since the mid-80's.\n\n2. And this is the kicker: I actually kind of like movies based off of video games. Well, I should change that too: I'll give movies based off of video games a chance. Maybe it's because I grew up in the age of the original Nintendo (and the age of the Atari, now that I think about it, although I was so young then that I had to ask my dad to hook it up everytime I wanted to play it), but I think it's possible to make a video game based movie as long as the film captures the spirit of the game. It's been done before: Both Tomb Raider films are kind of nifty; Mortal Kombat was fun in a Saturday afternoon way; And Resident Evil was OK, I suppose. But it's also been done really poorly: Wing Commander (does anyone even remember that game?); Double Dragon; Street Fighter all come to mind.\n\nSo, here we are with House of the Dead, an adaptation of the Sega arcade game (I'm guessing it was available on other platforms, but I'm only familer with the ardade version).\n\nIt was one of those first person games where the player used a lightgun to fire at zombies and such that lurched towards them. It was pretty cool, I suppose. And did a fairly good job of recreating the vibe of a 70's zombie flick. So, I actually thought it made a lot of sense to make a movie based off of it.\n\nThe Plot: A handful of young adults get a ferry ride to an island where an allnight rave is being held. They arrive only to find the place deserted, except for the legions of zombies being raised by the spirit of a tortured Spanish scientist from the 14th century or something.\n\nThrown into the mix are a crusty sea smuggler, and an undercover police officer.\n\nThe first twenty minutes or so of this is more bland than it is bad. But when the zombies start popping up, House of the Dead reaches an apex of sorts in what its trying to do. Let's just say that when the protagonists launch their big offensive against the dead, the story gives way to what seems like nearly 25 minutes of uninterrupted bloody action.\n\nBullets fly, heads go exploding, limbs get munched. All to the tune of a heavy metal song that I actually kind of liked. Well, I didn't like it so much as I thought it fit the scene real well. Maybe it's that part of me that grew up in the era of Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, but it's kind of nice to have heavy metal reclassified as \"devil music\" instead of \"I'm mad at my mommy for bringing home a stepdaddy music.\"\n\nYes, it's silly. Yes, the constant screen shots from the video game are a bit much. Yes, like i said, the big battle really does occupy nearly a third of the film's running time. All of these criticisms are valid, I suppose.\n\nStill, the movie worked for me. 2003 and 2004 found horror coming back to life in a way. New directors were going back to the past for inspiration, and bringing back new takes on old stories. Eli Roth's \"Cabin Fever\" drew from cyncical portraits of human cruelty like \"Last House on the Left.\" Marcus Nispel's redux of \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" did the same, only with a nearly apocalyptic visual sense. Heck, even the 2004 take of \"Dawn of the Dead\" showed new audiences a hint of the cerebral horror of George Romero.\n\nIt's amazing how quickly we lose our perspective on the genra. \"House of the Dead\", as far as im concerned, is the best, heck, the only, attempt at bringing the gritty, sloppy, rotten, zombie experience of Fulci back to life. Something I thought I'd never see playing at my local cineplex.\n\nDon't believe me? Well maybe I should give you some perspective. I told myself a long time ago that I wasn't going to complain anymore about \"Scream\" and wave of films passing themselves off as horror through the late 90's, since that genra has pretty much died out now, and that by doing so I was really starting to sound like one of those Fangoria dweebs. But honestly, what would you rather sit through when you go to the movies? \"Valentine\" or \"House of the Dead?\" \"Urban Legends\" or \"House of the Dead?\" \"I know what you did last summer\" or \"House of the Dead?\"\n\nYea, I thought so."

Usually making a movie on a computer game is a risky deal, and in this case the scale tipped towards the bad end. The end result was sort of unbearable. Had they decided NOT to have to constant flashes from the computer game put into the movie it would have worked so much better. It was frustrating and downright annoying having these flashes appear over and over throughout the movie.\n\nAs for the story. Well, it was sort of alright, weak plot line though, and not really fully thought through. There were some nice key elements in it, but the overall picture was too sloppy.\n\nThe acting was mediocre at best, with a bunch of really horrible ones thrown into the midst, making it a very strange combination of performances to look at. And also the characters people were given were vain and not really fleshed out, offering the actors/actresses little to work with.\n\nI liked the scenery and settings in the movie, they were nice enough, good details and seemed dark and sinister enough to actually work.\n\nOn to the zombies. Well there were a lot of inspiration taken from the old Italian zombie movies, giving the movie sort of a cheesy touch. Zombie movies of recent make should not have that kind of \"retro\" feel to it, it just doesn't work. And then some of the zombies had good make up and looked cool enough. Personally, I get ticked off with the whole \"let's have zombies running\" thing. Reanimated corpses should not be agile and running around. That was another push backward for the movie.\n\nI think it was a good attempt from Boll to put his touch on the House of the Dead game series, but the movie just came out less than perfect. I have rated this movie 4, because it is a zombie movie after all, and it does have its moments in the plot and the effects. But this is nothing spectacular, and there are far many better zombie movies available out there. But if you are a hardcore zombie fan like myself, you should take a peek at \"House of the Dead\"."

But there are many scary scenes, action scenes and good zombie figures. The movie was not bad. And almost of the horror fans will also like this movie, because it's fun, a little bit scary and it has a happy-end.\n\nThe actors in the film was bad. I mean, maybe the budget was small and there was no money for good actors, but they're really bad.\n\nHouse of Dead wasn't great, but it was worth watching, it's a: not good - not bad movie, just like \"Ghost of mars\"."

The acting is great, the soundtrack, marvelous, the script is flawless and the entire flow of the movie is amazing, and the adding of video game piece only adds more depth to the masterpiece that House Of The Dead is.\n\nThe action is so intense and groundbreaking that only those that refuse to see, can't see that The Matrix is a so obvious rip off of The House Of The Dead. Uwe Boll is a pioneer of this kind of top notch action.\n\nPerfect 10, I can only hope that Uwe Boll continues to deliver films of this quality and that Hollywood gives him the respect he so much deserves, and that his next movies (Alone in the Dark, Bloodrayne and Far Cry) follow the same line House of the Dead did."

It knows it's rubbish and does not try to be anything more than rubbish.\n\nIt's dire, but it's fun. A world where the fishermen are creepy and speak of evil prophecy? A world where a rave costs a $1000 boat ticket? A world where the dumb yet cute teenagers run around in tight/no tops? Welcome to House Of The Dead. A world that can exist without such things as plot or script, and just focus on killing zombies. And to be honest, good for them! This isn't high brow art, this is dumb enjoyment, and a fun way to kill an hour and a half. You don't need a massive IQ, you just sit down, relax and watch the inevitable dismemberment as a bunch of dumb teens get what's coming to them. OK, so it has plot holes the size of planets, and characters who act with the most frustrating stupidity. So what? The game was a dumb shoot-em-up, why should this be any different? Splicing in clips from the game adds to the computer game feel. So does having death clips where the screen turns red following flashbacks of the characters action. So why discard this policy after the first couple of kills? This is my one major complaint about the film. But apart from this, if you are looking to disengage brain and enjoy a perfectly serviceable horror film then here you go. And in an age where horror films appear to have lost their sense of fun (I'm talking to you Jeepers Creepers and Ginger Snaps) or are verging on the point of ridiculous (Cherry Falls), this film is beyond vital. Other directors, stop acting like we care about the characters!\n\nFinal point, I watched this and Oceans Twelve today. One was a perfectly enjoyable film. The other disappeared up it's own arse with it's pretension. No surprises which is which.\n\nHaving fun won't make you blind. Enjoy this film."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a truly terrible movie, and could only possibly appeal to people like myself who get a good laugh out of bad movies. Make no mistake, this one is hilarious.\n\nThere were so many continuity problems in this movie that I lost count. One character, for example, falls and gets his hand impaled. Yet minutes later in movie time, this has apparently been forgotten. He's walking around with full use of both hands and doesn't have so much as a hole in the glove that got a huge nail rammed through it just a couple of scenes before.\n\nIt's THAT bad.\n\nThe characters are on an island. At one point, the scene is cutting back and forth between a trashed rave and activities on the beach. On the beach, it's raining. At the rave site, it's dry.\n\nIt's THAT bad.\n\nThe script was awful. It was as if the writers attempted to cram every movie cliche ever imagined into one turkey of a film. At various points, the following lines are ALL uttered:\n\n\"It's quite out there.\" \"Too quiet.\"\n\n\"Not who... what.\"\n\n\"What part of shove off don't you understand.\"\n\nYes, it's THAT bad.\n\nThe camera work was particularly nauseating. Many of the shots spin around like your room after you've polished off that second pint of Jack Daniels. It goes around and around and around, faster and faster, until everything resolves into one big puddle of puke. One of the characters near the beginning of the film vomits over the side of the boat bringing them to the rave island. The water is absolutely calm, however. I can only conclude that his nausea was the result of having watched several action sequences in rapid succession.\n\nEven the editing was horrible. At one point, various images and sounds are flashing by in just such a way as to make me get up and make sure that something wasn't wrong with the DVD I'd rented. Throughout the film, too, there are quick images from the actual video game. They're sometimes used as transition sequences. This makes the movie violate the laws of physics by sucking and blowing at the same time.\n\nAt least the special effects were something, right? Wrong. At one point, we can clearly see the springboard device used by a leaping zombie. I zoomed in on it and watched the device operate in slow motion. Fascinating. I find it hard to believe that the editor missed this glaringly obvious bit of machinery.\n\nYet I can't give this gawd-awful movie a truly bad review, because I found myself laughing out loud at several points. This is not only a stinker, but it's a classic stinker. It's wonderfully horrible.\n\nReally, it's THAT bad."

        "review_detailed_main": "In three short years, German director Uwe Boll has launched himself from being that nobody who did that school-shooting movie to being the worst director of horror films/video-game adaptations. The man has a reputation. Is it deserved? When I first heard about this film and how bad people said it was, I first had to ask myself: can it really be that bad? When his second game adaptation, \"Alone in the Dark\" tanked and people said the same thing, I gave in and rented that film. I nearly drank myself blind trying to glean some kind of enjoyment out of that film. Now I've finally broken down and rented the film that started it all. I have not played any of the games Boll adapted, so I'm rating a film, not an adaptation.\n\nThere's a voice over narration at the start of this film, presumably to serve as a cheap way to give the viewer a sense of foreboding. Then we meet a group of young people met at the waterfront, having just missed their boat to \"the party of the century\". They wind up getting a ride from a guy named Captain Kirk (played by Jurgen Prochnow, who is way too good for this movie) and his creepy shipmate Salish (Clint Howard, doing the Clint Howard thing). Howard's character has a creepy stare and warns one of the bare breasted \"babes\" that the island they're heading to is \"eeeeevil\" and gives her a cross to protect herself with (you can tell he means it because he isn't looking at her chest). This is a cheesy highpoint, but the acting all around is less than great.\n\nWhen they reach the island their party is already deserted. Then, of course, the zombies start to show up. Since Uwe Boll is such an auteur he doesn't waste any time by trying to frighten his audience. No sir, nobody bothered to make the zombies all that scary, or all that visible. Most of the attack scenes are under-lit to the extreme and shown from a distance. So, there goes anything for fans of being frightened or fans of gore. Most of the focus with the zombies is our heroes kicking their butts. This is enhanced by lots of array shots, which were so not overused in \"The Matrix\" films that they must be fresh here.\n\nSome people die, a couple turn zombie, we find out the horrible truth about the zombies in an ugly sepia-tone flashback. Footage from the video game is thrown into various parts of the film, I guess to remind us that this is a video game movie and not just a regular bad movie. Like I said before, I couldn't care less about the source. After I finished the film I immediately watched it again with commentary just so I could hear the excuses they had for it. The commentary proved far more entertaining, mostly because of the instances where his actors questioned Boll's direction, to his face. Nothing he said did anything to really defend what is truly a horrible movie.\n\nThe reputation is deserved. The film is visually weak, the characters are practically non-existent (I remember them as Girl in America Flag Outfit, Bimbo, That Guy, Dude Who Mentions Romero, Jurgen Prochnow, Clint Howard), the zombies are like most others zombies except more forgettable, the action is unremarkable, and Boll ultimately shows no flare for the craft or art of film-making."

House of the Dead is not a film in the traditional sense. Sure it's a combination of a dozen other Zombie movies combined with a MTV style by way of the Matrix, but that isn't why HoD can be considered something other than a normal spook flic. HoD was shot in a way that deliberately de-emphasized the narrative nature of film. HoD, like Tomb Raider before it, was based upon a video game, but unlike other movies based upon video games, this thing never wanted to stray from what inspired it. Actual shots from the video game are interspersed into the multiple action sequences that make up HoD.\n\nNow, this obviously destroys any semblance of suspending disbelief. Shots of Playstation zombies getting their comeuppance during the middle of a cinematic zombie battle make sure that you are brought back to reality. There is no horror here; Hod screams at you, \"hey dummy, this is just a video game. Settle back and enjoy the carnage!\" ...and the carnage is quite good. I'm not sure that I was aware that there was this many ways to splatter a member of the living dead.\n\nI could discuss the cast, the \"plot\", or even the lame script, but what's the point really? House of the Dead is just a 90 minute back story to a reasonably popular video game. If you think you'd like that sort of thing, you'll like this. If not, rent a copy of anything by George Romero and see what a master of the genre can do.\n\nMovie Snob gives House of the Dead a 5."

Then the movie can along and negated every credibility and love that House of the Dead has given me.\n\nI am almost ashamed I actually watched this. Watching this movie was an insult. When you think 'House of the Dead', where do you think it will take place? A house, as you would suppose. WRONG, the film takes place on an island, of course there was a house that was only there for 5-10 minutes, at most. Why would they call it 'House of the Dead' then? Because Uwe Boll has the biggest marketing scam of all time. Choose a popular game title then create a movie from that. The dialogue was very very poorly written. Almost no creativity was put towards the film.\n\nThere were so many continuity errors it is almost hard to keep track. An example is that weapons that the characters use will switch, sometimes they will even disappear. I don't know maybe the director forgot to give them weapons between cuts I don't want to know either.\n\nThe acting was so bad. There was very little expressions given in their speech and all responses were clearly faked. But it wasn't the actors' fault entirely. To go along with working for the worst director of all time, this had easily one of the most laughable scripts ever written that wasn't a comedy. The dialogue was just so bad. Here's an example that I'll use when the characters engage in a fight with the villain, who isn't a villain really:\n\nRudy: You did all this to become immortal. Why?\n\nCastillo: To live forever!\n\nI don't know why these lines are so horrible, maybe it has something to do with Castillo not even answering Rudy's question. All he did was define immortality, I manged to figure that much out on my own. No questions were answered and when something gets revealed that's supposed to shock the audience I was just as confused at the end as I was when trying to piece together similarities between the game and the film. Despite the horrible acting, it is better than the game's acting, but that isn't really saying too much.\n\nHave I mentioned the fight scenes? They were just terrible. These people came to a rave on an island, they're just ordinary people like everyone else. But when they begin to engage in a fight all of a sudden the humans become martial arts masters. There was a 10 minute zombie showdown scene that is a perfect display on how not to film a zombie action scene. Nope, I take that back. That isn't how you should film an action scene PERIOD. The guns abilities to shoot are way over-exaggerated and it felt like an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, minus the awesomeness of course. It's ridiculous what the weapons can do, I appreciate ridiculous but this was just pathetic. As well as the people becoming martial artists, well the zombies do too. If that doesn't say something then nothing does.\n\nThe movie was just clich\u00e9, WAY too many shots in which the camera would rotate around a specific character. The more the filmmakers used it the more quickly I wanted the scene to end. Deaths are never actually seen on screen, but instead they included clips of the 'House of the Dead' video game or the screen just fades into an eye-burning red, like your closing your eyes while looking into a light. All around the film was almost unbearable to even watch. Plus, using clips is just another example that the movie had no reason to be so different from the game because they had source material to work with.\n\nMy rating for this abomination: 1/10\n\nIf you want an accurate representation on how much this film has effected my taste for zombie movies, then I'll tell you. I have only seen one zombie flick since watching House of the Dead. Yes, it's that bad."

The story seems to be a mixture of a \"teen-movie\", horror/thriller and adventure/action; although the writer of the script obviously had never seen a teen, thriller or adventure in his life and was incompetent with the use of language and portrayal. The name is promising but do not be deceived; not only will this make you cringe, it will depress you. After a half-hour of this film i was seriously contemplating shooting myself. The only reason i didn't was that dying with that film in mind would have seriously perverted my peaceful rest. Please do not watch this film."

Uwe BOll directed it, begins with two minutes of clips from the game, literally gave me a headache and then it showed something that seemed to have absolutely nothing to do with the movie or maybe i wasn't paying attention. THere is a lot of bubbling water for on this island and you start to wonder why there would be a rave party on this island. The film is called \"House of the dead\" and based on some great arcade games, but they appear to only be in the house for about a half hour of the movie and remember those dogs that jump out of the fountain and attack you before you get into the mansion in the games? well, they are nowhere to be seen, nor are the guys running around with chainsaws that look like leatherface, and there isn't a gargoyle like thing anywhere. They could've just called it \"Island of doom\". The film had some \"scary\" scenes before the violence started but then it was all violence with heads being blown up and all that crap. There were girls that used their fists and feet to kill a bunch of zombies, the zombies also died from one bullet to the chest and could jog. The game is about zombie hunters, this is about teens and a coast guard and a crazy fisherman with a crapload of guns all stuck together on an island that is filled with zombies. One of the only things they did right was the \"boss fight\" at the end when they fought the king zombie, the good guys had an axe and he had a sword, not at all like the game but okay. These teens were too good at avoiding zombies and killing them as they had good aim with the guns, could dodge sword attacks and could kill them with their bare hands. In the last fight, the girl is stabbed and falls dramatically then gets up two minutes later as her friend is being strangled by the zombie and then she finishes it off and they live happily ever after. some mindless crap is involved in this movie and the sequel is less violent, but has some suspenseful elements and is actually in the college campus for the whole movie, with the exception of a few scenes building up to it in the beginning, that one had the zombie hunters and none of it was mindless gore. See the sequel and you can skip this one unless your looking for a nice piece of trash to watch on a Saturday night."

The little flashback to explain why the zombies were there was weak, at best, and all of the action sequences made no sense. The only (and I do mean ONLY) part of the movie I enjoyed was when the group was running up to the house and shooting their way through the hordes of zombies (many of them, like all those martial arts films, waiting until one zombie gets shot before attacking) - the Matrix-like filming was pretty cool, except the whole thing only works as a music video. Logically (and I mean horror movie logic), none of it meant any sense. Jurgen Prochnow, an actor of some merit, must have needed the money real bad. This deserves to be on the Bottom #100, no doubt about it."

Yep, TV, so no boobies.\n\nHad I seen the uncensored version with the boobies, I might've given it a better score.\n\nThis movie is NOT GOOD. Please, don't watch it. I don't care how many times you've beaten the arcade game, just don't watch it. The movie has little to do with the game. Even the stupid flashes of game play footage in the movie don't help. In the game, you went to a house and killed zombies. Little storyline, lots of action, many quarters down the drain. The movie has some sort of a story line that's not worth remembering.\n\nBad things: The kids want to go to a rave. First of all, they are rich white kids (with a black girl, to be fair I guess) who have nothing better to do. I've never been to a rave, but I thought that people who went to raves were...well, ravers! These kids did NOT strike me as X popping' Techno heads.\n\nThe kids, ravers or not, sucked. The characters were so thin that I swear my corneas got paper cuts just by watching them. The acting was so bad, I was cheering when they got attacked by the zombies.\n\nWhy was the rave during DAYLIGHT HOURS!? I thought raves took place in dark locations, like abandoned warehouses. Then the flashing lights have more of a dramatic effect on your ecstasy-induced stupor. No, this rave took place in broad daylight. The attendees didn't look like ravers. In fact, they looked like random extras semi-dancing around (which is what they were). And, the techno music sucked.\n\nGotta love the gun play, really. The kids went from being whiny losers to gun-toting Special Forces operatives. Just like that. They were SO skilled, that they never reloaded their guns. The dude with the Desert Eagle? He shot that thing like 15 times in one scene! He's so 1337 that a 7 round magazine means nothing to him! Even more awesome? There was no noticeable recoil either! Even when that one chick used the shotgun? Her arms didn't jump. THAT's what I call real ultimate power.\n\nAnd the zombies sucked too. The zombies were apparently Navy SEALs in a past life, because they knew how to swim. One thing bothers me, though: When they were swimming with their heads above the water, you could see their breath. Zombies are cold dead magically reanimated flesh. No WARM BREATH CLOUDS.\n\nAnd some of the zombies...looked like extras wearing face paint. I mean really, couldn't Uwe afford to get REAL zombies? Pssh.\n\nIn the end, don't watch it. Unless you're drunk. It'll probably be funnier that way."

The movie is kinda fun but ruined at times but this lack of professionalism that transpires through the continuity inconsistencies.\n\nAnd don't tell me it's because the budget is low. A movie like \"The hills have eyes\" was extremely low budget but there are no inconsistencies in the unfolding of the story.\n\nFunny thing: in the DVD there is a documentary on Zombies in movie-making in which George Romero acknowledges difficulties to finance his own 4th \"Dead\" movie.

Plus it had awesome character development for such a short film. The only problem I have with this movie is Ellie Cornell, who played Casper. I mean what happend to her, she was awesome in halloween 4 & 5. Did she forget how to act? But she did look great and I still love her, so in the end I gave House of the Dead 10 out of 10.

        "review_detailed_main": "On my first chance to watch this infamous movie, I honestly can say that I was not expecting mistakes of this degree in a movie of this budget. It is as if they had given a good budget to a complete amateur. In fact, the entire film-making is completely the opposite to the one Boll displayed in his previous movie \"Hearts of America\" (2003). The only thing that could explain this serious mess is if Boll believes that his target audience is hungry for pointless and dumb scary movies. I hate to say it, but this movie is that: pointless and utterly stupid.\n\nLoosely based on the popular video game, the movie tells the story of a group of teenagers who are going to a rave in an island, only to find that in the middle of the party, a group of strange people appeared and killed everyone. They will discover that the strange people who murdered the ravers is not really alive.\n\nEven when the plot of the movie has nothing to do with the video game (only the fact that in both appear the Zombies), the basic idea had potential for being an average horror flick; but the script completely ruins every chance it has for being original and interesting by throwing in a series unrealistic situations that serve the only purpose of moving to the action scenes. This leads to a poor development of both the characters and the plot, as if writers Dave Parker and Mark Altaman were more concerned in getting quickly into flashy action sequences, cheap jump scares and pointless nudity.\n\nThe direction by Uwe Boll does nothing to save the mess this movie is, and even shows a talent to make the already bad written movie even worse. Not only displays a shaky hand-held camera work that makes it look amateurish, the poor edition and the quick cuts make the movie look like a lame MTV video.\n\nI must recognize that Boll certainly had good intentions. The infamous use of footage from the video game could had been a well received idea by the fans of the video game, but his overuse of that resource gets tiresome and annoying specially if we consider that the footage has nothing to do with the scenes. Also, the bullet-time effect is well-used in a few occasions, but in the climatic battle for survival it ends up so repetitive that also ends up as a silly attempt for being innovative.\n\nThe acting is among the worst, not only because of the poor casting of young adults as teenagers; most of the time they look as if they had no idea of what they were supposed to do. Nevertheless, I must say that the few stars I'm giving to this are because of J\u00fcrgen Prochnow's performance. He retains some dignity and his character is the only one that is realistic and well played.\n\nOverall, this movie is another good story wasted that will disappoint the fans of the video game. 2/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "...but sadly little else, thanks to the empty script. Uwe Boll's oft-bashed first US feature is not the train wreck many bandwagon-haters proclaim it to be, though it is certainly no master piece.\n\nThe movie starts out with a flash back monologue that lets the audience know bad things are afoot (like we couldn't already guess that) and then is off and running with some party scenes on a gorgeous island that concludes with a some skinny dipping carnage (is there any other kind). From there the film introduces most of the primary cast as they attempt to reach the \"party of the year\" on the island, only to find instead a zombie wasteland.\n\nOK, the story pretty much sucks. Forget about the script taking chances, it barely can keep itself afloat with clique characters and some awful dialogue. Fortunately, genre regulars Jurgen (Seventh Sign) Prochnew, Ellie (Halloween 4) Cornell, Jonathan (Final Destination 2) Cherry, and the ever lovable Clint (oh just pick one) Howard are on hand to add the right amount of knowing winks to make things alright.\n\nFrom the production stand point, things are fairly polished given the uber-low budget. Boll is actually able to scratch out some occasionally nifty visual effects to go along with the gobs of creature gore on hand. The zombies themselves are plentiful and damn near every one gets the ever loving hell blow out of them, much to my delight (why else do people watch these things).\n\nIt does nothing to advance the zombie sub-genre, nor does it effect a quality story, but the over abundance of zombie carnage ought to keep most horror fans happy.\n\n6/10"

I have seen this movie probably four or five times, just like with his other awful film Alone in the Dark. The best recommendation I can give for this movie is that if you love to watch a movie that makes you laugh at its ridiculous plots and scenes, you will love this movie like I do. You will never think it is a great film, because as everyone who has seen this movie knows, it is not, but it is terribly funny. Awfully funny. After seeing this, everyone I knew was mad at me for making them see it. It is that terrible. Keep watching Uwe Boll, for he will surely continue to put out terrible video game movies that make me laugh and wish i could make celluloid spontaneously combust."

The girls were cute, at least, and the one actor anyone had ever heard of, Jurgen Prochnow, was big-time slumming. His career must be over. As usual, in films like this, there were huge plot holes and outrageous continuity breaks. And, it seemed to me, the zombies in this film were awfully agile. Reminiscent of \"28 Days Later\" but those weren't really zombies. These re-animated corpses ran, jumped, swam, and even used weapons. What must George Romero, or your average Haitian, think? I'd have to recommend that everyone should run away screaming from the prospect of sitting through this movie."

The terrible kind that bore the heck out of you and make you fall asleep and 2. The kind that is just soooooo stupid that it's actually funny.\n\nFor me, House of the Dead was the second choice. I admit that it was really, really stupid.

That was the worst part of the film! The story was OK. The linear story direction was put well. Now the visuals had its great points and annoying points. It had great action scenes, especially the camera angles of the bullets flying and zombies dying! But the part that irritated me was the video game scene transitions. Why show the video game at all? In my opinion, it would have been better to just have the scene transitions normal and not show how the film compares to the game. So with all that together, it is a great movie to kill 120 minutes with."

Once our fools arrive, the place is deserted. Zombies attack. Bullets are fired. Quick edits are employed. What little plot there is is forgotten as events move with a notable lack of logic (they hole up in the 'house,' run back to the boat, then run back to the 'house' again?).\n\nWith a script this awful, one can hardly blame Boll for doing endless slo-mo and 360-degree freeze frames...trouble is, this comes off as the MTV filler it is, and gets old after the first 2 or 3 times. Ditto the intrusive, random screen shots from the actual video game spliced in with the live action. As for the acting, the 'name' performers convey the whole bill-paying nature of the enterprise, while the 'no names' stumble through scenes with pitiable awkwardness (what is with that moron kicking a DOA ghoul?). The zombie makeup ranges from 'not bad' to 'pretty silly,' and the violence is so exaggerated it ventures into camp (though this certainly ain't no \"Dead Alive\"). And the \"Matrix\"-style gunshots are just SO 1999, man...\n\nUltimately, what's strange about \"House of the Dead\" is that it isn't the worst movie I've seen--in fact, the negative word-of-mouth is what drew me to it in the first place. Is it a 'good' movie? No, not by a long shot. But it isn't necessarily rock-bottom awful, either. While Boll is too slick and kinetic with his camera to draw favorable comparisons to the humbler Ed Wood, his films do leave a slimy, ectoplasmic residue that fascinates (in a morbid, 'how-much-worse-can-it-get' way)...\n\nSide note: How in the world did George Romero and Tom Savini wind up in the behind-the-scenes featurette? I'm not complaining...though outdated (with Romero pontificating on what would become \"Land of the Dead\"), their presence is certainly the high point of the DVD package (watch/listen for a moment where the line, \"the success of films like 'House of the Dead'\" seems DUBBED IN to Romero's dialog)."

The plot (if it can be called that) consists of some 20-something year olds, who are going to the \"Rave of the century\" on some island. After missing the main boat, they get an old fisherman to give them a ride for $1000. Well, the rave is surely no \"Rave of the century\", it consists of a small stage, some porta potties, and a couple tents. Wow. That's one great rave. A thousand bucks well spent. Anyways, the kids arrive there, find blood splattered all over the rave, nobody there. What do they do? Of course, they go to find all of the partiers, assuming that it was all a big prank. Well, of course they are wrong, and they hole up in a small tomb-like house (that is about 20 times bigger on the inside than it appears from the outside) and fight the zombies to save their lives.\n\nI was plain out bored with this movie. The director added a bunch of ridiculous shots from the actual video game the film was inspired by, why? I have no idea, but it looked terrible. The acting was boring and unconvincing, and the writing. Oh, the writing! What kind of person would go look for the \"rave\" after they arrive there and find the place to be splattered with blood. How likely is it that the entire rave wanted to play a big joke like that? This made me automatically hate the characters. And as they died off, we even got this cheesy still-shot of the camera revolving around them, and the screen fading to red. The person died, we get it, you don't have to include this little farewell.\n\nOverall, \"House of the Dead\" is boring. It's unoriginal, badly acted, and nothing we haven't seen before. I think I'll give it one extra point for the semi-good zombie gore, but other than that, avoid this movie. 2/10."

I had heard how bad it was, and saw pieces of it, but I just had this bizarre urge to watch it. So I did, and I think Uwe Boll should personally find a way to give me my time back.\n\nI cannot even begin to try and decipher the plot and storyline of the film. It really is that bad.\n\nBasically, a few young 20-somethings miss the boat to get to an island where the greatest rave of the century is apparently going on. They pay extra to be transported there, only to find no one at the party at all. From here, zombies attack and we find our reason for why no one is around, and why our characters need to stay alive.\n\nSimply put, Boll should be barred and banned from Hollywood. If he touches anything in it, his hands should incinerate on contact. This man is a menace, and we need to lock him up or deport him before he continues his streak of cinematic abortions gone wrong (whioch has seen the likes of Alone in the Dark and Bloodrayne since then). This movie is just god awful, and I feel hard set at trying to use words to describe it.\n\nThere are shots of breasts, for the sake of showing breasts.\n\nThere is immense blood, shown, for the sake of showing immense blood (forget being true to the source, it's way too overdone here).\n\nThere is a sense of ridiculousness, for the sake, of being totally ridiculous.\n\nThis, all added together, makes for one the worst films in the history of Hollywood cinema.\n\nI will concede though, I was impressed that the screenwriters found room to explain why there are random guns on the island they enter. Of course, they miss out on the explanation of how our characters know how to use these guns so accurately, and how they know how to fight like they could beat Bruce Lee himself. But then, if they bothered to explain that, they would have to explain how the characters know how to use other weapons like swords, or how they know how to bend gravity and use \"bullet-time\" to their advantage.\n\nMy brain can only be left at the door for so long before he needs to come back. These screenwriters, and Boll himself, made him find the need to come back and attempt to comprehend how completely ludicrous the entire thing is.\n\nYes, we understand this is a movie based on a video game. We do not need frames from the game spliced into the film to remind us. You also do not need to add the cheesy pan around the characters after they die. It's a classy touch, but an unneeded one. You also do not need to have random memory lapses by characters who are not even in the flashbacks being flashbacked to. You also do not need to steal from every film under the sun (from The Matrix, to Star Trek, to George Romero's ...of the Dead Quadrilogy, and that's just a skim from the top) to try and make this movie anything more than it already is. It screams of lazy screen writing, and bellows of even lazier greenlighting.\n\nEven the half-assed \"shock\" ending is just that. Half-assed.\n\nI looked for saving grace, and outside of a few humorous lines of dialogue (including one even mentioning Romero's films), I could not find any.\n\nIt's a terrible film, that just never should have gone past the screenplay. Everyone involved (and thank God most of the actors have only really done Indies) should be ashamed of themselves. Boll should have learned his lesson with this piece of trash, but only time will tell if he will stop making these continued cinematic crimes against humanity.\n\n0.5/10.\n\n(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com)."

And it's also not \"Return of the Living Dead\" either.\n\nBut it is a fast-paced, hyper-actively-cut movie with neat effects, just 90 mins. of mind shutdown. The director mixes in the fast scenes also pictures from the video game; I like that, although this seems to be my Minority Report on that effect. When you rent this movie, what you expect is a shallow Zombie-action movie with Splatter elements; and voil\u00e0!

I've never seen such an entertaining bad movie as HOTD. Most really bad movies are extremely low budgeted and mostly just boring. HOTD however has got a fast pacing and a crazy visual style to it like no other bad movie has ever had before. The sets are equally comic. Like they were leftovers from an old Ed Wood movie.\n\nThe visuals mostly make no sense at all. But they ads to the unintentional comedy and has some crazy matrix like zombie action together with insert shots from the video game.\n\nThe zombies are of the fast running kind and their makeup is hilarious. Not to forget the rave music throughout the whole movie and the rave party invaded by a horde of the living dead. It certainly is the most entertaining bad movie I've ever seen.\n\nHouse of The Dead is the worst of the movies made by Uwe Boll that I've seen of so far. But it is also his most entertaining one. The whole movies is fast paced throughout. His other efforts are mostly very slow-paced between the hilarious scenes of action that's a trademark of Uwe Boll.\n\nThe photography is unexpectedly good looking. Uwes strong point has always been that he's a good technician. He just doesn't know how to use the visuals to make any kind of sense. It only ads to the comical effect.\n\nIf one watches Uwe Bolls latest efforts one can clearly see that he has improved a lot as a filmmaker over the years. He still has a long way to go. But it seems like he continues to learn by his mistakes and improve on his faults. And that is something the man deserves some credit for. Most people never does. It will surely be very interesting to see how his movies in the years to come will turn out.\n\nI'm not sure how to grade this movie because it entertained me a lot but for all the wrong reason."

I guess I was most put off by the instant fighting and shooting skills the characters displayed in the face of danger, the relative calm they all exhibited when they had a gun in their hand and were shooting dozens of zombies, the ridiculous camera shots with the freeze framing and panning just to make it look cool. So... I won't give it a 1 because of two reasons 1.) I didn't pay to see it and 2.) I've seen worse."

The movie has EXCELLENT special effects that, I personally think, just raise the bar for movies just to high. I really love the idea of using the video game screens to change between scenes, and I really love the idea of instead of using the stupid \"air wave\" idea for slo-mo bullets, the director (Uwe Boll) uses water and it makes for a great and fun movie for everyone to enjoy. Many people say that there is no plot, but you have to play the videogame first! Rudy, who is the last to survive invents the zombies in the first video game and that is what its about, the beginning of the zombies which are supposed to be stopped on December, 18, 1998 (In the video game). This movie is just ahead of its time and that is why people don't like but if the director reads this, I really hope that you direct the sequel which I heard is in development, I hope that you make it EXTREMELY scary!)\n\nIf you know the plot of the house of the dead video game you will LOVE the movie!"

They are then attacked by the world's lamest zombies, and fight them off using concentrated stupidity and bullet-time. Then there's a vampire pirate and a helicopter.\n\nPeople will try to justify this as a \"Fun B Movie\", \"Something you aren't meant to take seriously\" and that you should \"Just turn your brain off and enjoy it\".\n\nDespite the fact opinions are subjective and thus cannot be right or wrong, these people are still wrong. While it is certainly a B-Movie, it's not fun, and the only way to enjoy it would be to think \"at least these people are never, ever going to work again\", except that they probably will.\n\nThe characters are totally bland cyphers who may as well be mannequins. This isn't \"light\" characterisation, it's non-existent characterisation, so I don't care what happens to them. Even when they should be scared or amazed - which the audience would at least relate to even if the characters redefine \"2 dimensional\" - the movie is too concerned with being cool to let us feel anything. There's so many bullet-time shots, video game clips (yeah, really), smug references to infinitely better movies and characters doing things solely so they can be put in danger that there's no truth to any of it; it's all soulless artifice that never progresses beyond the \"A House of the Dead movie would be cool!\" stage of its life.\n\nNo feeling. No life. No soul. A void. See, those \"fun B-movies\" that people love to go on about as some kind of justification for supporting tripe like this... they might have had bad effects, laughable scripts and wooden acting, but the people involved were trying to make something entertaining. The people who made House of the Dead were going on a $12 million self-indulgent ego-trip, and clearly didn't care what the end result was because, hey, wouldn't a House of the Dead movie be cool? Answer: Possibly, if it was made by someone else.\n\nAnd, to cap it all off, they managed to take something as inherently cool as a VAMPIRE PIRATE, and then make him one of the most boring villains in history. If I made a movie, it would be about a vampire pirate killing the people who made this, then turning them into vampires so he could keep killing them. That would rule.\n\nPositive aspects: Topless women.\n\nNegative aspects: Everything else. You can also find topless women on the internet for free, and without supporting the makers of this film, rendering the only positive aspect moot.\n\nDon't be tempted to rent it because it might be so bad it's good. It's an infuriating pile of wank, and, combined with the recent \"hits\" Resident Evil and Underworld, has probably set horror back to the pleistocene period. If you could give 0/10, I would. Actually, I'd go lower."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is taking horrible criticism here on the IMDB. It is really strange to me to read such bad reviews from people who claim to be fans of old fashioned horror. I read one review that blasted HOTD and the writer wrote, \"I was hoping to see something like an old Romero or Fulcci flick.\" HOTD is definitely not what you would call a \"great\" movie, but it does succeed in being similar to an old Fulcii style zombie movie.\n\nThe bottom line critique for HOTD is, if you liked Fulcii's \"ZOMBIE,\" then you should like this movie. It really surprised me to see a modern movie done in such an authentic 1970's horror style. The movie even begins with gratuitous shots of HOT naked girls! The zombie makeup is VERY 1970. Most of the zombies simply have on white make up. The best zombies in the movie have a dirty brown latex \"skull\" mask. They look pretty good. Those are my favorite style of zombies. The dialogue and acting is total \"camp\" style. It is totally laughable. This of course means that you will either love this movie for its laughable quality, or you will hate it. I like campy horror movies, so I liked HOTD. I definitely believe that if HOTD had been released at some point in the 1970's, it would now be a cult classic, not unlike \"LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT\" or \"ZOMBIE\" or \"THE HILLS HAVE EYES\" or dare I say \"EVIL DEAD.\"\n\nOne characteristic of the movie that definitely departs from the 1970's style is the use of MATRIX style bullet time effects. It's pretty fun to watch the high tech special effects in the middle of the zombie melet.\n\nThe big zombie confrontation in the middle of the film is a lot of fun to watch. This is the part of the movie when our gang is trying to fight their way through a crowd of zombies in the middle of a spooky graveyard to get inside \"THE HOUSE.\" That scene was a lot of fun to watch, mindless as it was. It is a battle-royale with zombies exploding and people being torn limb from limb. The sequence went on much longer than I thought it would! They just keep on fighting and fighting and blood and body parts go flying all over the place. COOL!\n\nThis movie is getting slammed in the reviews, and I think that is unfortunate. The movie feels very much like a low-budget independent horror movie. So if you like those, you will probably like HOTD. I think one of the reasons the movie is not well recieved is because people are expecting something more like \"RESIDENT EVIL.\" If you are going to watch this movie, try not to take it so seriously. It really reminded me a lot of \"ZOMBIE\" which I enjoyed, and also \"CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS.\" If you are looking for low budget fun and a zombie halocaustic setting, then you will like this movie...as long as you have a sense of humor about what you are watching!\n\nA little word to the other IMDB reviewers: LIGHTEN UP A LITTLE, GUYS!"

In another scene, they can swim and are Olympic gymnasts. Then they are walking drones (Like in every other zombie movie) in another scene. It's totally asinine. No one can act (They rooted through the bottom of the actor bargain bin for this one) and they all run off at alternate points because they probably wanted to be in a better movie (Like Gigli maybe). The cast alternates from being really scared to using karate on the zombies and all gung ho. The script (is there one?) has no logic to it and often calls for moments from the video game to flash across the screen, as if to remind us if to make sure we all know where this stuff originated from. The dialog sucks. Let me give you an example of how bad it gets \"Dude, oh man you're sick. Here's a beer to make you feel better.\" \"You wanted to be immortal. Why?\" \"To live forever.\" Stuff blows up for no reason. The cast chooses to go to a shack that has torches in front and a million zombies in front over getting on a boat to leave. They rip off Jaws, Scooby Doo, and better zombie movies. Some characters are named Captain Kirk and Casper. I could go on, but you get the idea. This is worse than Texas Chainsaw Massacre. F-"

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is way ahead of its time; the appropriate time would be when I'm so senile just planting me in front of a television and its flashing light puts a smile of my drooling face.\n\nThe House of the Dead, named for the `house music' played during the movie's pivotal rave party rather then after any architectural feature, is certainly the weakest of Clint Howard's one armed fishermen tales of the Pacific North West.\n\nBare breasts, yet a weak selection of off-the-rack firearms make this a difficult movie to reconcile or compare to other representatives of the zombie island film genre (with the notable exception of `Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island' of course). Instead, it would better to compare this cinematic gem with what I ate for lunch today. My lunch was much better.\n\nThe digital special effects were quite impressive; for instance Jurgen Prochnow was added digitally in the otherwise uncastable role of Captain Kirk, the fifteen hundred dollar ferryman to the stars. The visual transition from movie to video game to staring at the ceiling of the theater wishing it would all end was seamless, and should also really warrant some special technical consideration.\n\n2/10"

And so we were flipping channels and I said \"House of the Dead eh? The game sucks, lets see how bad the movie is.\" The game is entertaining, yea. The only purpose it serves is to entertain people before their movie is ready at the theater, but I suppose it does exist in standalone arcades (why anyone buys railshooters for consoles is beyond me). Unfortunately the movie was just rife with stereotypical zombie movie surrealities (Zombies are far more real than the acting and intelligence of this group of kids, and plot, would have you believe the actual living people are). It sucked, there's no need to even be specific. The entire time I just wanted the hot girls to do something interesting but even that didn't happen.\n\nIf you ever have nothing to do and you catch this garbage on TV, watch it. You'll laugh for sure. It's worth watching for a bad movie to watch, such as Revenge of the Ninja."

They even manage to create an ASHesque character. Imagine the result if Bruce Campbell and Carter from Trading Spaces had a love child, only without the wit OR the power tools of either. They could at least have given him a rechargeable drill with a spade bit, if a chainsaw wasn't handy.\n\nThis movie isn't bad in a \"so bad it's good\" way. Not in a \"bad enough to laugh at and enjoy\" way.\n\nIt's just bad.\n\nWhy, pray tell, is Sci Fi running it nonstop? Oh no, you say? Oh, yes. Have a look at their website and check out the upcoming Sci Fi original movies. Yes, indeedy. House of the Dead 2!\n\nI advise you to watch this movie on Sci Fi, then rate it a 1.

I was pleasantly surprised to spend an hour and a half watching a decent film; much better than a lot of big budget stuff, such as some of the Hollywood remakes of some horror classics. So long as you understand the budget background, and find lower budget films entertaining - such as great Brit Flicks like Shawn of the Dead -there's something worth watching here. I'm guessing this was more of a Canadian film than USA, and that seems to show in the whole manner of the film. I've often found that many Canadian movies to have some magic ingredient that makes them stand out, but an ingredient that doesn't taste good to the masses.\n\nThe effects were appropriate for the low budget background; don't expect the sort of stuff you see in Resident Evil. Apart from too much dialogue to the audience at the beginning, the direction and production quality was good. The acting was appropriate for the roles without being award quality; bimbos were bimbos, tough guys were tough guys, etc. The lead role (J Cherry) was the usual brooding thoughtful hero type.\n\nSimple, unchallenging entertainment that doesn't pretend to be something it isn't. If you are a fan of the original game or game genre you should like it."

(snap)\n\nWhat the hell was that? Wowwie! I'm amazed. I had no idea that human excrement could be rented at Blockbuster. Little did I know you could put it in a DVD player. This film is so crappy, I could almost hear Uwe Bowel grunting, popping blood vessels and fart-splattering in a little plastic outhouse in Vancouver, directly onto the lens of the camera. I had to keep leaving the room. Really. I couldn't stay there watching it. It hurt too much. It's like watching a whino vomit on his shoes just for fun. I now understand the concept of Chinese water torture. I think I lost a few 7th grade English classes there. I can't even write an intelligent review anymore.\n\nThis film is called \"House of the Dead\", but there's no house in it. Right off the bat, it's false advertising. hehe... It even suggests that this is supposed to be a movie that you pay to see.\n\nWhat's with the spinning camera? It serves no purpose but to make it look like there's a reason for this to be shot on celluloid instead of an old VHS camera found at the local Goodwill.\n\nI especially loved the zombie-on-a-stick that pops up like a whack-a-mole, to have a firecracker go off in its head as if it were getting shot by the girl who jumps up to fire for no apparent reason other than to look pretentiously cool.\n\nI know horror films are usually bad, and most bad horror flicks go directly to video. How the %#@$! did this end up on big screens across the USA?!?!? Is there a new market for diarrhea on celluloid? It's gotta be this whole \"video game movie\" trend. The producer obviously got a drippy erection when he heard that he could make a movie based on a semi-popular video game for a low budget. I'm sure they spent a fortune on Clint Howard's lousy cameos. Poor Clint.\n\nThe saddest part about this is the director is STILL GETTING WORK, and I can't find Rod Serling standing around smoking a pipe talking to a camera anywhere! Believe me, I've looked. Who's pipe is Uwe Bowel cleaning to be this lucky?\n\nNice film...for me to poop on! 1/10"

I have seen many zombie films in my lifetime, many of them brilliant, others not so.\n\n2 - I have seen many awful film; Hercules in New York, Garfield, Alone In The Dark and Baby Genius are to name but a few.\n\nWhen having mates round my house for a \"movie marathon\" night (usually about 6 films in a row),we usually go for 1 film that we know is going to be awfully crap. So on New Year's Eve, 2005. We rented Uwe Boll's \"House Of The Dead\", knowing full well what critic's have said, knowing full well where it is placed in IMDb's worst all time films. Yet, we watched, and why? for the comic value. We rent bad films to laugh at them. If you think you're going to be able to watch a bad film and take it seriously, or mad. However, watch it with the intention of laughing at it (especially with a few mates) and your guaranteed a good time.\n\nThis was not the case with this film. It went straight passed \"so bad its funny\" straight to the disastrous \"so bad its annoying\". Uwe Boll has tried to make the film adaptation of the classic arcade shooter \"House Of The Dead\", which, any director would try and do with care. Look at \"Mortal Kombat\" and \"Doom\", the directors and writers clearly know the story (or lack of) of the games, and turned it into a film, knowing what it is the audience wants to sees (be it fighting or monster demons.)\n\nYet with this monstrosity, Boll has taken the franchise with the pure knowledge that the ENTIRE of his film will consist of \"zombies being shot\"...and that's what he delivers. But even that simple concept is badly done. The zombies are extremely badly designed and created and is laughable when they're seen swimming, jumping (especially off clearly visible jump pads), running and swinging / throwing axes.\n\nAlmost as bad is the characterisation. OK, so we can clearly expect that there's going to be almost none of it, given it's a little horror film. But let me ask you a few questions:\n\n1 - Would you pay \u00a31000 to go to ONE rave? 2 - Once realising the rave has been interrupted and the people have disappeared, would you stay, drink and attempt to have sex? 3 - If you were a simple teenager / young adult, and you've seen the chaos of your friends being killed by zombies - would you have the mental and physical strength to pick up serious hardware, and go all \"matrix\" on zombies?\n\nIf you answered \"no\" to all of those questions, then you can carry on reading. If you answered \"yes\" to any of them and wasn't joking, shame on you.\n\nThis film has no reason to be this bad. Given that Uwe Boll (suposedly) had a decent budget and had one 1st class actor (jurgen prochnow - sorry about spelling)he should have been able to create a good film. The only way that he puts in references to the arcade game, is through very quick 1 second shots of the game itself, with zombies being shot or monsters attacking the screen. This, instead of being thoughtfully placed or helping the film progress, just makes it all the more annoying and adds to the temptation to pressing the \"off\" button on the DVD player.\n\nThis film cannot be stated as a \"one off bad film\" from the director, he has followed on to make \"Alone In The Dark\" and \"Bloodrayne\", both of them under the score of 3.0 on this website. It's sad to see his later plans are good ideas, because its hard to stray from the truth that he will utterly screw them up.\n\nResist this film at all cost, it does not deserve your money.\n\nResist EVERY Uwe Boll film at all cost, he does not deserve your money."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"House of the Dead\" is a great game. It may have ripped off \"Resident Evil,\" but by that logic, you can say \"Resident Evil\" ripped off George A. Romero, and so on. So when I initially heard that they were making a movie based on one of my favorite first-person shooter games, I was excited. But then I read over and over again how horrible it was, and decided to wait until it was on cable rather than blow money on it in the theater. When I finally saw it, I realized that there were no words to describe how horrible it was. Since it's based on a video game, I never expected an Oscar winner, but for God's sake - I've seen some bad movies based on video games, but this one is even worse than \"Double Dragon,\" and believe me, that's pretty bad. You almost have to TRY to make a movie this bad.\n\nUwe Boll, you are not a director. I know you narcissistically think of yourself as \"the best in the business,\" but sooner or later, reality has to step in. In the meantime, here's a few hints to help with that reality check:\n\n1. Using the Sega logo at the rave didn't make any sense. Honestly, what band is going to have Sega as a sponsor? The New Kids On The Block reunion tour?\n\n2. Placing young rave-goers in a sudden horrific predicament won't automatically make them highly-trained counter-terrorism operatives.\n\n3. The game is called \"House of the Dead,\" not \"Shack of the Dead.\" The house in the game is an enormous mansion, not some dilapidated pile of crap in the middle of no where.\n\n4. Having Clint Howard repeat his dialog in a weird voice was just annoying as all Hell, not creepy or funny, whichever you were going for. Just let Clint Howard be Clint Howard.\n\n5. I got the \"U-boat\" and \"Captain Kirk\" jokes concerning J\u00fcrgen Prochnow. They sucked. The only way anything in this movie was funny was unintentionally.\n\n6. If people want to see scenes from the game, they'll pay fifty cents to play it, not six dollars to see them as cut scenes in a movie.\n\n7. The zombies didn't run in the game. Why should they in the movie? Face it, Boll - you're no Zack Snyder.\n\n8. Making zombies the leading authorities on tree-grabbing doesn't do much to make them terrifying.\n\n9. Chances are that ancient Spanish explorers would be speaking Spanish to each other, not English. Ever hear of subtitles?\n\n10. The mere mention of the genius of George A. Romero in this cinematic waste is almost unforgivable.\n\nAs for my fellow movie-goers - especially compulsive lovers of zombie films such as myself - if you have absolutely nothing else to do, you might want to check out \"House of the Dead\" for a few laughs. Nothing else. And for the love of God, if you have to see it, see it on cable; don't rent it. I've seen plenty of excellent zombie films as well as plenty of excessively cheesy ones, and I'll tell you right now, S. William Hinzman's \"Flesheater\" was better than this one. At least that one didn't try to be something it wasn't - a cheesy zombie film. A comatose barnacle could make something better than this. The very fact that Uwe Boll didn't direct \"House of the Dead 2: Dead Aim\" implies that there may actually be hope for it."

        "review_detailed_main": "While not up there with some of the better zombie movies of our day I still think this film manages to hold up well for what is is. The action sequences and camera work during them were pretty nifty, and the video game footage interspersed was a novel idea. The acting and dialog, while on the surface seem wooden, may actually be an attempt to shadow what happens in a game- with characters saying things that would seem stupid in a real life situation, but are exactly the kinds of things you expect to hear from video game characters (\"Guys, check out this book. Looks pretty old, maybe it'll help us!\"). A lot of the camera work and in particular the work during and after the death scenes also drive the point home that yes, this movie is based on the concept of a game. In terms of upholding the cheesy horror movie tradition this film does fairly well, with plenty of pointless female nudity, plenty of over the top gore and plenty of lame dialog (whether intended or not).\n\nDefinitely a movie to avoid if you don't have an appreciation for B-grade flicks, but for those of us who love our horror as bad as it gets, don't go passing this one up."

You just watch how some guys are walking around shooting walking corpses that jump from the corner.THAT'S IT!Do not search for any plot(you don't need it anyway),just accept that all that's going on is \"some guys shooting zombies\".Isn't it BRILLIANT!?Zombies!Lots of'em just jumping around waiting to be shot!It brings a sarcastic smile on my face every time I think of this film.

        "review_detailed_main": "I rated this movie a one out of ten for several reasons. No, for the sake of my money and sanity, I have not actually seen this movie. No one can prove to me otherwise that Uwe Boll is talented in any degree: whether it's a video game 'adaptation' or not. I choose not to see any of his movies. Am I missing out? Nah, not really. I can make my own using an extremely light budget of Windows XP Movie Maker, some mp3s, and poorly drawn animation - and get at least a 6 or a 7 on IMDb for trying.\n\nWhat amazes me the most though about this, is that when you look at this movie - a lot of people have also called the Super Mario Bros. and Street Fighter movie to be very bad. But here is the thing: they stayed closer to the actual material than this movie ever did - and I've played House of the Dead at the arcades to know that this movie has nothing to do with the game at all. The only thing kept from the game are the zombies. This makes me wonder now, A) Why are people going to Uwe Boll to direct versions of their video games on film? Hasn't the poor performance pretty much proved enough? and B) Why waste time with Uwe Boll? Instead of walking in to get a George A. Romero-inspired masterpiece, we get the stereotypical zombie blaxploitation films of the 70's and 80's - where quality didn't matter, and people didn't take the genre seriously. Or at least - making a good game into a good movie very seriously.\n\nPersonally, next to SMB and the SF movie, I kindly enjoyed Tomb Raider, and only the first Resident Evil movie. RE1 may have been far from the plot, but at least it went down with dignity. This movie... like anything by Uwe Boll, should be banished from all eternity. Maybe Uwe Boll with it too."

        "review_detailed_main": "There isn't a single appealing characteristic present in House of the Dead. From the dull, suspense-dispensing opening to the ripped-off ending, this movie failed to entertain in any way whatsoever.\n\nJonathan Cherry apparently is shaping up to be the poor man's version of Bruce Campbell, only without the acting talent. His character Rudy spends much of the movie in a mopy fit, failing to do anything heroic, and even watching other characters die while he stands off to the side.\n\nEmoional moments fail to work, mostly due to the actors, but also due to the script. Mark Altman and Dave Parker have xeroxed pages from other movies, threw in a few zombie references, and went clubbing for the rest of the day. Much of the dialogue is grating (\"Matt? Matt? Matt? Is that you Matt? Matt? Is that you Matt? Matt?\"...continue that for several more hours.)\n\nIn the commercials, the special effects are the most appealing element...great 360-degree shots while fighting. But in the actually movie, the editing around the shots is incoherent...Karma e.g., is holding one gun in a regular shot, then two guns in a static 360. Clips from the actual video game first are used as an entertaining breakaway between scenes, but are used distractingly during fight scenes. The lousy game over sequences used for certain characters is atrocious.\n\nDon't waste your money..."

I still have it somewhere in my DVD collection, and if I ever need something to remind me that whatever I've written - nothing could be as bad as the dialog in that movie. I have a fondness for bad horror movies, I absolutely love some of them, and loathe others. Trying to approach a movie like this with the sensibilities of a seasoned critic will not work.

The fact that everybody in the cast of that movie were totally unknown people didn't bother me at all, what did bother me was that none of them had skills for acting at all!! I mean it, a chimp could have performed better than them! Totally, 100% not believable, they seemed like children practicing for a school play, with the big difference that kids look cute, these people looked like total idiots! Awful, awful! special mention for the worst actor/actress in a motion picture to that blond girl, I can't even remember her name, the only blond chick in the group, and the other guy, Simon I think. Guys, you definitely need to start looking for something else to do, stay away from the cameras please!\n\nTo be honest, I couldn't even watch the whole thing, once the movie was supposed to \"take off\", it got a lot worse. Terrible script! so predictable, so lame! You don't have to be a scientist to know what's going to happen next. Obviously they had a lot of influence from the \"Friday the 13th\", but at least those movies come from an original idea and keep you entertained, this one doesn't accomplish neither one or the other.\n\nAnd it didn't scare me at all, even the make-up used for the zombies was terrible in this movie, which is supposed to be one of the most important ones in a zombie movie right? It looked like they just bought a bunch of cheap make-up at Wal-Mart, mixed it together, and there you go! a zombie!\n\nWell, I just wasted about 1 hour of my life that I will never get back, it doesn't matter if you are a fan of zombie movies, or the game, AVOID THIS MOVIE!!! 1/2 out of ***** (I put 1/2 only b/c after all, at least the actors did show up for their work to finish the movie, although it would have been better if they would have kept this God-awful film in a basement of the studios)."

Therefore it seems rather misplaced to give the movie a bad review on that account. Instead it might be reasonable to give it credit for actually following the concept of the game from which it has emerged - pure, non-intellectual, mindless action, with no purpose what so ever, but to 1) kill monsters 2) collect ammo 3) kill more monsters. This is by a long shot not the best movie I've ever seen. But it gave me one and a half hour of entertainment, which was what I expected from It. In short: If you want a socialist realistic zombie movie, I would not advise investing money in this movie. This is mindless zombie-action with no other meaning but action in itself.

The problem is the house was about 4 rooms big and was only explored during the last portion of the film. The plot was very thin and lacked any detail, for characters or for a setting. Even the starring villian, the main zombie, was left highly undeveloped. However, the film did teach me that if I am stuck in a life and death situation, I too will possess martial arts skills and highly accurate marksmanship. The use of \"bullet time\" camera effects was highly over used. The video game footage cut scenes were too and the character deaths were just plain...stupid. To sum it up, horrible plot and acting...sounds like this one might be a cult classic in the future (unfortunately)."

I can't believe I paid money to go see this in the theater (I lost count of how many people left). Horrible, horrible, horrible crap- that Uwe Boll continues to be employed is astonishing.\n\nThe brilliant minds that green-lighted this excrement should seriously spend the rest of eternity being made to watch it nonstop.\n\nI honestly and sincerely believe that this movie is so hideous, so awful, and so mind obliterating that those of us who either paid to see this in theaters or heaven forbid purchased it could successfully sue for our money back."

Moreover, the slow motion Matrix-like scenes were terribly overdone.\n\nThe movie was totally unbelievable. All of a sudden the rave-goers are acting like trained assassins, skilled in firearms?!?! Ridiculous!!\n\nGenerally, I enjoy a good laugh during a horror flick. This film was so pathetic, it was not even funny.\n\nDO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!"

Anyone who disses this movie doesn't understand the zombie genre. If looking for a serious scary film or serious zombie film watch Resident Evil. Not this. But in and of itself and what it is supposed to be it is great. The plot holes aren't serious unless you are looking instead of watching the movie in which case i suggest you lessen up. They are just rich kids with no brains. Of course they stay after seeing a blood covered camp they are stupid. And if you were watching it you would see that the person who controls the boat didn't want to go so they couldn't either and then it was too late. Anyways not a masterpiece but better entertainment than any of the crappy remakes coming out lately.\n\n8 out of 10"

There were several instances where they cut between the live action footage, and footage from the game, which unless the intent was to nauseate, severely missed the mark. Overall, I recommend it if you have a group of friends that are down to roast this movie with, and get a few laughs (and more than one eyeful, if you know what I mean) along the way."

How in God's name does this bastard get movies made? There has go to be a way to get him to stop. He must have watched this film after he made it, so obviously torture won't work. Can he be put in prison, or at least killed? As for anybody who actually liked this, go to hell. Anyone who would recommend this to another person is evil. However, this movie was quite powerful and resonant in other ways. First, it actually made me mad at my TV. After all we had been through, why would she put me through this. Second, it made me mad at myself. How could I possibly watch this. Lastly, it made me mad at humanity. How could we, as a species, allow this. The next time I feel like watching an Uwe Boll film I think I will go in the bathroom, take a crap, and stare at it for an hour and a half. I guarantee the plot, acting, and direction will be far better. And on a personal note, if Mr. Boll wants to get in the ring with his critics, I am 6'6\", 238lbs and really, really angry now."

Tragically for me I was as weak as a kitten or I would have walked out of my own house to avoid accidentally seeing parts of this movie while skipping thru channels. I somehow managed to sit thru it's entirety, I guess it was kind of like a train wreck, you know you shouldn't watch but you can't turn away. The horrible action sequences actually used clips from the game, there was WAY too much use of stop motion 360 degree matrix style cinematics, and the dialogue was the worst I've ever heard. Characters that \"wish they were Foxy Brown\" or being named Liberty and wearing a gaudy stars and stripes motif Lycra suit, naming them CPT Kirk?!?! Everyone becomes instant kung fu masters the moment they're pursued by the incredibly fast and agile \"undead\", then become expert sharpshooters and professional soldiers when CPT Kirk open his case full of guns. At which point there a dialogue exchange of \"we don't have any food or guns\" to which CPT Kirk replied \"\"we do now\" then opened his box containing about 1 gun a couple flares and some random rounds of ammunition. Apparently the rest were invisible in the box because everyone had at least 2 guns the next time you see them. It was like a clown car only a gun box, things just kept coming out of it. I could go on but I'm getting sick again seeing the movie in my head.\n\nThe fact that Uwe Boll is allowed to make films both astonishes and disgusts me. Anyone who would use fast action clips from a game released by Sega in 1996 to make a film in 2003 needs to have their head examined. So does anyone who would finance that person. I feel sorry for anyone that saw this movie and feel even sorrier for the cast, because after this bomb they were no doubt unable to find work.\n\nI guess Uwe Boll put out some kind of challenge where he would fight his critics. If I have to fight him to stop him from ever making another film, I'd consider it my service to the world. I'd rather challenge him to make something that doesn't make me violently ill, or at least something an elementary school AV club couldn't outproduce.\n\nIf you want to see this I suggest to panhandle for some change and rent it so you don't actually spend your money. You'll need that for strong drink and probably some drugs if you plan of sitting thru this one."

        "review_detailed_main": "House of the Dead\" is one of the most challenging movies to rate, primarily because it balances its status as one of the worst films ever made with an undeniable, albeit unintentional, level of entertainment. The movie revolves around a nonsensical plot that serves mainly as a vehicle for teenagers and other characters to battle zombies and monsters on a remote island during a rave party. Despite its shortcomings, the film offers some engaging action scenes with plenty of shootouts and fights against zombies and other creatures. The makeup and costume design of the monsters and zombies are commendable, given the overall quality of the film. The acting and dialogue are notoriously poor, but this aligns with the similarly questionable voice acting and dialogue from the video game it is based on. The film's pacing is quick and keeps the viewer engaged, even though much of the plot remains bewildering. A subplot involving an old pirate and the release of a virus on the island adds to the chaotic nature of the story. While \"House of the Dead\" has received harsh reviews and is often considered one of the worst movies, it carries a certain charm for those who appreciate B-movie madness and are aware of the film's context. Watching it with an understanding of its reputation and taking it for what it is-an absurd, action-packed zombie flick-can make the experience surprisingly enjoyable."

I have read exerpts from the Book of Satan (the bible of Satanists...it was a school project, don't judge me) but I had never been afraid of humanity until this very moment. I watched House of the Dead for the second time tonight, mainly as a science experiment to see if it would drive my friend insane. It is, by far, the second worst movie ever made. I want you to understand my full meaning here. I've seen \"Manos: Hands of Fate,\" I have seen \"Phantom From 10,000 Leagues\" and all of the 60s horror that can be shoved into a DVD player. I have even watched basic cable. Nothing could prepare me for Uwe Boll's defecation upon the genre of Video Game movies. This film, if the term applies since it appears to have been shot on the record function of a cell phone, breaks every rule of cinema. It has the worst acting of its time, and less horror than the average school lunch. I admit that I am biased, as I have also seen \"Alone in the Dark\" and have since given up religion or the thought of ever letting children enter this world with my genes. Uwe Boll also gets the credit (read: blame) for that one. If you have rented this film, or any Uwe Boll monstrosity, then do yourself a favor and drop the disc in the microwave. In fact, burn down the aisle in the video store where you rented it from. The taint of this film will forever stain you, but you can save others. That's all that's left for me. i have lost my soul because of this bastardization of the visual art. Pray for me.\n\nAK"

        "review_detailed_main": "There are actually two kinds of game-adaptation movies: good ones, like Resident Evil, for example, and bad ones, like... like House of the Dead. However, this was not simply a bad movie: it was more like strange, stupid, pointless, AND bad. Oh, and let's not forget dumb - from all angles.\n\nFirst of all, the story... let's see. A few kids are running up and down, chased by zombies, and eventually getting caught only to die a completely meaningless and unnecessary death. And this is not a plot summary, this is the whole story! I imagine the screenplay didn't have much more details than this. Then, the acting. Now that was funny... except for Jurgen Prochnow the actors were young \"talents\", but they didn't show much, mostly ran around screaming or shooting, before ending up dead. Fortunately the characters had no details and dimensions at all, so I didn't feel sorry for them when all of a sudden they died the most stupid way they could (one moment they were fighting like combat marines, the next they were zombie food, like if the director decided it was their turn to sacrifice themselves for nothing).\n\nOther than those, there were a few remarkable effects in the movie I can't help mentioning. Before anyone starts to guess how much it resembled the game, I tell you: a hundred and ten per cent. First of all, there were scenes cut out directly from the arcade version of the game and placed into the movie one-in-one. This means you see the kids shooting, then for a sec you get a shooting scene from the game, then you see the kids again. There were plenty of such 'tricks' here and there - how very original, artistic, and incredibly DUMB of the director... Otherwise, fights were exactly the same as in the game, but seeing it in an arcade is more entertaining than in a movie. Imagine kids with huge guns, totally unaware of their lives being at stake or their friends getting killed time after time, shooting at countless zombies swarming around them (really, there were lots of scenes where you saw one of the \"heroes\" in slow-motion, shooting at a zombie running at him, while there were dozens of other monsters just running around, clearly without any intention to attack). Then, throw in a few bullett time effects (or something remotely alike), where there is your hero shooting/kicking/grinning, and the camera goes around him like in the player selection of any prestigeous arcade game. This looks good in the one-millionth episode of the Mortal Kombat series, but come on, are we doing a movie here or what? Dumb again.\n\nFinally, a few words about the genre... just to see clearly. Horror... there was a significant amount of blood for sure, but the zombies looked more like old men and women, and seeing them chewing on the characters was laughable at most. Thriller - why so? I was not afraid a bit, only astonished by all this movie had to give. Mystery, now that's true: in the last 10 minutes or so, the remaining heroes uncovered an old legend connected to the zombies, which, however, didn't play any role at all in the plot. It just... WAS. And, to say the least, it was DUMB. Action? I give you that. There was plenty of it, from all kinds: all-out, frontal, gunpowder-smelling, sweaty, bullett-timey, arcade action. Dumb and pointless, that's true, but action\n\nindeed.\n\nWhat else should I say? I would recommend this movie to any who wants a good laugh at a stupid zombie flick with poor acting and no story. Otherwise - you may as well skip it and see a real horror movie.\n\nNo secret: 1 of 10"

However, when the group arrives, all they find is an empty dance floor and bloody clothes. Determined to find out what happened to the rest of the party-goers, the clan set's off on a mission through a zombie-infested forest. During this crusade, they are aided by a police chick and a sea captain that just happens to have the right number of weapons to give to each of the kids. They also meet up with Jonathan Cherry and some other survivors. Basically the rest of the movie is a collection of poorly directed action sequences including a far too long shootout outside of the \"house of the dead.\" This fight came complete with cheesy Hollywood violence, redundant clips from the HOTD video game, and sloppy matrix-esque camera rotations. One of the character's even volunteers to sacrifice himself to save the others. Why? Not because he was noble and brave, but because part of his face got scarred by acid a zombie spat on him after he continued to beat the creature long after it had been disabled! I'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy?!?\n\nTo sum it all up, there is absolutely no point in seeing this movie unless you want to see for yourself just how terrible it is. The theater I was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen, and I'm sure the money I wasted seeing this piece of sh*t could easily cover the costs it took to make it. GRADE: F"

But I know that being bad is some-kind-of merit too and I'm interested in movies based on games so I rented this.\n\nMovie starts promisingly with calm and cool narrator voice who tells about his friends. In this point dialog is funny and clever but immediately when the narrator stops there starts simple and clumsy dialog. I wrote that kind of dialog when I was six years old. Actors have no energy in their performances expect with that raincoat man but either his character or his acting is annoying.\n\nScript has no surprises and plot is nearly invisible. They just go to some mysterious rave party in some mysterious island (Who arraigned that anyway?) and start to slaughter zombies when they attack. Characters reactions are unbelievable (I would mourn more if my friend became eaten by zombies) and their weapon skills are unrealistically good. I'm pretty sure that if they are first timers they can't shoot that well (or swing a sword on that matter) but how should I know since I haven't used any weapon in my life.\n\nUwe Boll tries to differ from gray director mass but any directing solution doesn't work. The worst mistake is adding parts from House of the Dead games in middle of action scenes. They cut them too much and make it feel like a video game even though it should feel like a movie. Action scenes are horrible anyway because there is added many cool camera angles which make it messy. Some times camera is just way too close. Also that rap music is bad and makes it feel like a comedy.\n\nIn summary this movie is worse than Battlefield Earth. Even that cool narrator changes energy-less and rushing in the end. Two funny jokes are not enough to save this. This film will be remembered as a true classic but from wrong reasons."

For people reading reviews, trying to figure out if this movie is worth it; I say hell no. I wouldn't pay 10 dollars to see it at a theatre, and I wouldn't pay 5 dollars to rent it. However I would pay 5 bucks to own it. Why? Every time I watch this movie I laugh.\n\nI recommend this movie to anyone who watches movies as a form of entertainment, not an art form.

HOUSE remains among the worst films ever made, right up there with AX EM, the worst movie ever made. A group of 20-somethings hit an island for a rave, only to find the island overrun by zombies. Along the way, they run into a cop and a couple of others who have survived the onslaught so far. The zombies are played by a group of extras who reminded me of the zombies in some of the Italian-made zombie cheapies. Little or no makeup, little or no direction. The 20-somethings are mostly nonactors as well. The shootings are done up video game-style (no surprise there). Nothing really happens. And we are quickly lulled to sleep. Jurgen Prochnow plays a cigar-chomping boat captain. He fails to act as well. Avoid this!"

It's so convoluted that even the characters look confused, and trust me, their acting skills are about as sharp as a spoon. You'll find yourself rooting for the zombies because they're the only ones showing any signs of life in this snooze-fest.\n\nAnd let's talk about the special effects, shall we? I haven't seen CGI this outdated since my old flip phone. The zombies are about as terrifying as a puppy in a Halloween costume, and the action scenes are so poorly choreographed that I had to double-check if I accidentally stumbled into a high school drama club rehearsal. House of the Dead is so bad that even Uwe Boll probably disowns it in his list of cinematic atrocities. If you're looking for a good time, stay far, far away from this undead trainwreck of a movie."

When a group of bloodthirsty zombies comes to kill or eat them alive. Now these group of kids along with a boat captain (Jurgen Prochnow) and a marine police officer (Ellie Cornell) battle the undead to stay alive.\n\nDirected by Uwe Boll (Alone in the Dark, BloodRayne, Postal) made an another instant Camp Classic film with plenty of ridiculous humour, first class bad acting but at least... it has some exciting action sequences and good make-up effects. This is one of Boll's most entertaining film along with \"Dungenon Siege\". Prochnow gives the film's best performance and he seems to be having some fun in the movie but he was unhappy with the script changes during production. Cult B-Movie Actor:Clint Howard appears in a small role as the skipper. This film was an small success in theaters but find itself instead cult audiences on DVD, for those who enjoyed bad movies.\n\nDVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an strong DTS 5.1 Surround Sound (Also in Dolby Digital 5.1). DVD includes two entertaining commentary tracks by the filmmakers. Commentary one is by the director, crew members and actor:Sanderson. The Second Commentary by the Executive Producer/Story/Co-Screenwriter:Mark A. Altman is the most enjoyable to listen. DVD also includes Deleted Scenes, Two Featurettes and more. \"House of the Dead\" is a enjoyable bad movie but there's one thing... i truly hated in this feature is Boll's use of showing video game footage every couple of minutes or so. It relies too heavily on reminding viewers, we are watching an live-action video game. Since this feature was shot on Super 35, which it was seen in theaters in the 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Probably in the Uwe Boll's new re-cut of \"House of the Dead:Funny Version\" will might see it in the original 2.35:1 format. Which it's coming out soon on DVD. If you love bad film-making, don't miss this. (*** 1/2 out of *****)."

I must admit I didn't expect this movie to be outstanding, but neither did I expect to be like this. Sometimes we complaint about movies without being objective, because we didn't like this or that, and other viewers can think different. This is the one movie where this rule doesn't apply. The movie sucks, it has no plot (even the game had a better plot, and you were shooting things 99% of the time), the jokes are not funny, the actors seem retarded, but the worst is that for the first time in my life this movie gave me the impression that the director was insulting me and my intelligence (I don't know how to explain it in other way). It seems like the guy is laughing his ass off in front of all the fans of the game (if any) and all the people who paid something to see his \"work\".\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm a fan of horror movies, and I'm accustomed to bad movies (in fact there are few good horror movies out there) but this one crosses the line of RESPECT towards the viewer.

A band of idiots and a take-no-prisoners go-go dancer (?) end up on Isla del Muerte for the rave of the year only to get eaten by the \"re-animated homo sapient\" of a centuries old priest who was banished to the island from Spain for creating a death-cheating serum. If you want to see what a cinematic piece of dog barf looks like, go see House of the Dead, otherwise do yourself a favor and play the video game, it's far more entertaining."

        "review_detailed_main": "But it's not as bad as I've heard some people make it out. Some people claim that the entire film, from start to finish, is one big turd. That's not quite so. There are some nice shots and... well, J\u00fcrgen Prochnow is in it. But that's it.\n\nApparently, there is a large rave on a big island in the middle of nowhere and a group of teens want to get to it. So they pay a strange fisherman (Prochnow) to get them there. When they arrive, they realize (well, at least one of them does) that something is out of place. That's right, something is out of place. The entire rave is empty, yet only one of the characters seem bothered by this.\n\nSoon they are attacked by zombies and team up with other people to survive this hellish night. Or something like that.\n\nWhy did I watch this film? Because I wanted some zombie action. I wanted to see some people be bitten, scream and turn into zombies. To bad the zombies in this film are nothing like ordinary zombies. Forget anything you think you know about zombies. These guys are not tough. They're pushovers. Shoot them anywhere, and they go down. Also, they're fast. And they fight, with weapons and karate moves! As a matter of fact, these zombies are like ordinary humans except that they don't talk. It could have been any action movie out there, but just replaced the bad guys wardrobe with lots of rotting flesh.\n\nThe dialog is some of the worst I've ever heard. It's so ridiculous, and when coming out of these actor's mouths I can't help but to smile. It's really stupid, and laughable. But the problem with this film is that it's very dull. It's no \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" where you can sit back and enjoy the lack of brains. It's just dull. The plot, the characters, the monsters. Everything! There's a lot of strange things going on as well. For example, there's a ten minute long action scene with people just shooting zombies in \"cool\" ways. Sure, could have worked for a minute or two. But for TEN MINUTES?! You'll be tempted to fast forward through that, trust me. Especially since it's very stupid. A bunch of rave teens suddenly turn into Neo, Trinity and Morpheus and karate kick, bullet-time jump and blast their way through hordes of zombies. And I mean, hordes! There must have been at least a hundred zombies or so killed in that sequence alone, if not more! Between scenes, there's shots from the game. It makes no sense, but they are there. Suddenly, computer graphics (from the game) pop up on the screen and you wonder what the hell is going on. Don't worry, it's just a scene transition.\n\nOne of the most boring films I've ever seen, and even so there's always something happening. That's when you know there's something wrong. But in all fairness, I HAVE seen worse films. There are a couple of stylished shots that look cool and since you walk in with low expectations you probably won't be that disappointed.\n\nI give it a three. It's bad, it's not worth watching, but I've seen worse."

Geez, I've seen better raves at the mall on kiddie night.. THIS RAVE HAS CORPORATE SPONSORS! Enough of that.. Uwe Boll, if that is his real name (I know I wouldn't put my real name on this slice of dreck) should hide his face in shame. What should have been a decent man eating zombie movie has become, and I say this sincerely, potboiler. The characters are clich\u00e9, the villains are clich\u00e9, and the supporting cast is clich\u00e9. The FX were pretty decent, but EVEN THE FREAKING STUNTS WERE Clich\u00e9!!! They looked like something out of \"The A Team\".\n\nUwe Boll tries to be the Ang Lee of the American cinema. He uses a HELL OF A LOT of those freeze frame tricks, and they detract from the movie, in my opinion. Too much eye candy causes brain decay, Uwe! Too much time expansion, I mean, come on, 5 to 7 minutes to cross 50 yards, even with zombies is a BIT MUCH! I didn't time it the first time, and I can't bring myself to watch it again to get the correct time. The first time felt like am eternity. I haven't seen anything this bad in years, and I can't remember last time I did, even stretching my considerable mental facilities to their fullest! I could have done better with a Betacam and a minimum editing facility, as long as I had a decent FX house behind me. The zombies were fairly decent, if, you guessed it, clich\u00e9. If you want a real zombie movie with a halfway decent plot and story, don't waste your time on this pile of recycled dreck, watch one of the Romero movies, or Sam Raimi's \"Evil Dead\" movies, or even one of the \"Return Of The Living Dead\" movies (except 4 or 5)\n\n*** LEAVE THIS ON THE SHELVES AT THE VIDEO STORE *** Even the sex scenes were clich\u00e9, and about as sexy as watching octogenarians go at it.\n\nMy humble opinion\n\nBill"

The Characters were 2-d at best (apart from the captain who I wanted to live so badly just so SOME good could come out of this thing) and the dialogue must have been written by someone who had only a vague idea of what human speech was and tried to dictate to a person who only spoke a foreign language.

He makes films like he wants, so there could be so many negative comments about this film, and it wouldn't matter. Boll is a good figure to look at if you are an aspiring filmmaker. This film can be used as a example in low budget film-making. How to or how not to do is up to you. All other things aside, this is a horrible attempt at a zombie flick, and the fact that it is based on a video game, doesn't help it either. Johnathan Cherry and Jurgen Prochnow are the only \"actors\" here, as the rest of the cast should have been buried with this film in a movie vault far, far away. There are low camera angles that reveal how bad the special effects are. There is one cool effect, but a few good things, can't save this loser. Watch Romero's stuff, and leave this trash alone."

I have noticed that someone rated this movie as a 10. It is because of people like that, that this movie doesn't get the true place in the bottom 100 movies on IMDb. It needs to be in the bottom 5 at least. I know that some of you will read this and say, \"I know what a bad movie is, I don't need to see this to know\", I say to you, look at this and then decide. They have many scenes where they show the video game where the movie came from during the movie. There are zombies that look like trees and then they stand up and start fighting.

From here, survival becomes their only thought as they desperately try to escape the island. It's possible that this could have been successfully written despite most video game to movies being rather unsuccessful however this movie fails rather adeptly. Plot holes are large enough for an army of zombies to march through as issues such as how the virus is spread, how there seem to be more zombies than originally started on the island and many more are never addressed.\n\nSecond - there's the absolutely terrible acting. These people mustve just been hired out of a college acting class because they hardly bring across any of the emotions your supposed to feel. Along with this comes the special effects: overdone, repetitive and taken almost right out of the Matrix itself with no effort made to bring originality into the mix.\n\nThis movie, terribly done and a pain to watch, deserves nothing more than a 1 as it really isnt worth the 5 bucks to rent."

The video game scenes were weird, although I did enjoy the opening credits, and the way the camera circled around a character was pretty pointless. Yet it's corniness charmed me. Most importantly, the flow of the movie kept me going. A pure action flick with VERY stylized violence. There are some nice tidbits here and there, like when Castillo put his tongue into the girls ear. Very disturbing moment to say the least. I think he made a fun popcorn movie where people can make fun of it, but have a good time because of the movie itself. Also, I enjoyed the effects a lot, and was a fan of the zombie make-up/gore."

However, the worst offender of the video game movie genre is Uwe Boll and his first American movie was an adaptation of the popular light gun game, House of the Dead.\n\nWhile this isn't his worst movie, it insinuates everything wrong with an Uwe Boll movie. The script is badly written, the decisions characters make are dumb and the directing decisions are baffling.\n\nThere are several moments when clips from the video game are used as transitions or to intercut with action scenes. This is incredibly distracting and I'm aware it's an attempt to make it look and feel like a video game but it's a damn movie. Also, when characters die they use this 360-degree rotating shot which is another terrible gimmick.\n\nI'll give the movie some credit though, it's so bad it's hilarious. It has lots of shooting action, gore, late nineties electronic music and Matrix-esque bullet time sequences, while simultaneously trying to make it look like a video game.\n\nUwe Boll continued to make other cinematic abominations such as Bloodrayne, Alone in the Dark, In the Name of the King, Far Cry, Postal and Rampage. Boll retired from filmmaking at the end of 2016, leaving behind a legacy of the worst video game adaptations imaginable."

How can you not love Clint Howard or the cigar chomping old salt of a captain Jurgen Prochow. Everything was perfect for this movie, the dialog (bad) the acting (wretched)the music (loud) and it had HEAD SHOTS!! The only thing that bothered me was that the rave was sponsored by \"SEGA\"?! I never heard of a corporate sponsored rave. Oh well. I bet the director had this on his mind when he made the movie (I have a lousy script, a low budget and some bad actors. Hell, I'll make one of the cheesiest b-movies ever based on a video game!). I have to say he succeeded.\n\nHighly recommended!"

There are movies that are so bad, they're good(and a select few that go beyond that, *back* to bad... thank you, Ghost World). But Uwe Boll's movies... this may be the first one I've watched, though I wouldn't exactly brag about having watched more than one, except maybe on account of having that high tolerance. Uwe Boll's movies... just saying it, sort of, you know, bad aftertaste. He seems to largely make movies based on video-games(at what point does \"someone's gotta do it\" become \"... if he's our only option, I can do without it\"?), and, while I can agree that that might not be the easiest kind to make(has there been a truly good one yet? They tend to range between \"watchable\" and... \"not\"), it would seem that Boll's are extraordinarily poor. The plot is... worse than it had to be. The acting is atrocious. The dialog is awful. The editing and cinematography both seem dead-set on turning the \"film\" into a music video, and the action... well, you might as well watch someone play the game(at times, it would be *more* entertaining to do so), better yet, play it yourself. The use of footage from the game, all... *32*?(!) of them... uh, yeah, Uwe? Don't. The music... eh. Language is loose, there is some nudity, and plenty of violence/gore. Attempts are made to recreate some of the recognizable images from the game, with reasonable success, I suppose. I recommend this to... fans of... Uwe...? No, that's not it... people looking for horror...? Hm... well, if you've got *nothing* to do for an hour and a half, if it's on or you've borrowed it(so there's no personal cost to you, money-wise), I guess there are worse things to be doing, if that does make for a terribly short list. 1/10"

All though the blond girl made it fun to watch, by being stupid, this was still not a very interesting movie to see. Some of the lines in \"House of the dead\" were to low for me and I have a sense of humor. I have seen most of the low budget horror movies since the 70s and not all of them are good, but this is worse than all the other movies together. How ever, Jurgen is still Jurgen, but I felt that what on earth was he thinking doing this movie? I read the user comment before seeing this movie and was surprised to see how right the guy was for once. According to the user comment, you would see people running through the woods, flashes of zombies and running people again. This is the typical \"Friday the 13th\" style and in the early 80s this was actually scary to me. Today it is not! Actually this is so so bad. It is a 90 min movie and it took me several hours to finish seeing it because it was so bad. I felt like someone was trying to rip my brains out from my head from all the flashes. There is nothing more annoying than bad filmed movies and this was one of them. I needed 10 breaks or so in between the bad flashes of people running around like they were not even scared. I don't think it's all to hard playing scared, but I was obviously very wrong. To all horror movie fans out there. This movie is only worth seeing for 1 reason and that is a line from the bimbo that was really funny and a line from Jurgen. The rest of the movie is a pain to watch in my opinion so do yourself a favor and don't watch \"House of the dead\"! There are a lot more exciting ways to spend a Friday night for sure. I would really hope that someone could do another version of \"House of the dead\" and do it better. It can be done better!"

But they arrive to find all the partygoers dead. After being attacked by zombies, they arm themselves with Kirk's weapons & take on the zombies in a massive battle.\n\nEver since the mid-1990s, there have been videogames featuring zombies, from \"Resident Evil\" to \"House of the Dead\". While \"Resident Evil\" was an intelligent & frequently scary example of survival horror, \"House of the Dead\" was just mindless FPS action, where the only goal was to kill as many zombies as you can. The zombies in the game are just an excuse to appeal to zombie fans in the same way that \"Resident Evil\" did (& did better). Both games have since been turned into feature films, along with sequels. While the film version of \"Resident Evil\" was a success, even if not an entirely good film, \"House of the Dead\" is a failure on all counts. The script, being written by fans of the game, is extremely poor - why is there a rave party held on a deserted island? The acting is negligible, although Jurgen Prochnow gives an enjoyable performance as the smuggler Captain Kirk (there are a couple of jokes about \"Das Boot\" and \"Star Trek\"). Clint Howard plays the bugged-out sailor in a bad way. While most zombie films are driven for outlandish gore effects, this one is driven for action film poses & is an excuse to showcase some silly 'bullet-time' scenes, as well as display some screenshots from the original game. Both are exercises in cinematic stupidity. That said, the action scenes are not too bad."

Or simply shooting the smuggler captain from the beginning? Where did this bunch of weakling coeds suddenly acquire sharpshooting skills and martial arts?). The acting is beyond bottom of the barrel -- your local high-school drama department could come up with more emotional delivery of lines.

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay, this is going to be long, but please bear with me. Now, I'm not going to spoil this movie for anybody who might not have seen it, but I'll just give you a little NON-SPOILING teaser-like thing. Just to give you context. IT'S HORRIBLE!!! This is how the movie was made: The director grabbed every bad movie that was ever made by human being, all of the worst dialogue and shoved it into a shotgun. Then the director pulled the trigger and then picked up the pieces and placed them all nicely on a table and then grabbed a bazooka and blew up what was left of the movies/screenplays. But somehow a few pieces managed to stay intact. So he sent the writer to pick up all the pieces of the movie and tried to make a script out of it (TRIED) and failed miserably. He thought he was making a script, but nothing seemed right. But he didn't care. He just handed that to the actors and they TRIED to read it, but it was so confusing and stuff that they thought it was a combination of Peruvian/Russian/Japanese and Elvish (from Lord of the Rings) Obviously, one language is hard enough to learn and one of these languages shouldn't even be known by the average Joe and plain Jane. But the actors didn't care. They TRIED to read but got nothing and then lost the scripts an eighth of the way through shooting.\n\nThen the actors go to the director for... well... DIRECTION!!! (an amazing unheard concept. I mean, whoever heard of a director giving directions? Hmm) Well, he finally decided to help. But this guy is a big fat guy and he forgot what movie he was making. So trying to make himself sound like he still knew what he was doing, he just kept saying stuff like, \"okay and then... this person shows up... and then... you die... No the zombie won't kill you. It's part of the drama. Just lie there and pretend to die. yeah, good. Perfect.\" but in the end, he realized that this wasn't helping and... well, actually, he did something really smart. As in, seriously, this was pretty cool. No other director could have pulled it off. (ie: Spielberg, Lucas, Jackson) The director went to get a lobotomy.\n\nThen he came back and WITH A PSYCHIC TRANSLATOR. Interesting enough, this psychic translator believed that he could read the minds of vegetables. (Which doesn't make sense because the part of their mind that allows thought is gone) But he couldn't really. So the actors turned to them for help and asked the translator what the director was thinking. But he couldn't understand anything. (Amazing) He was reading his OWN mind, but he still didn't get it. He thought he was hearing a combination of German/Russian and a form of Slavic. And the best part is, this psychic translator is a fat little Egyptian kid with a twinky in his mouth. And he telling the actors what he thinks the director is saying but he doesn't speak English. But the actors (smart as they are) think that they know what he's saying a begin improvising the whole damn movie.\n\nThat's pretty much what you've got. My advise to you, see it if you must. You will not like it, and if you do, tell me why. I haven't the slightest idea how you can like this movie. You can enjoy it maybe, but not like it.\n\n(By the way, I have nothing against Egyptians. I think they are a highly underrated people. I am not trying to insult anyone who is Egyptian or a vegetable. Even if you were involved with House of the Dead.) So all in all, bad movie, save your time, not worth it unless you want to make fun of it. -10/10. (yeah, it's that good.)"

Their inner demons have been literalised as zombies which they must defeat in order to survive their ordeal. If Dostoyevsky - who IMDb has curiously not given story credit, by the way - were alive today, I'm sure he'd greatly approve of this imaginative adaptation.

A number of students who missed being at the rave, party, on the island lead by Alicia, Ona Grauer, get local seaman Captain Kirk, Jurgen Prochnow, together with his first mate hook man Salish (Clint Howard), to take them there for something like $1,000.00 for his services.\n\nRight away you know things aren't going well since the captain is hesitant to go to the island because of it reputation for nobody ever coming back from there alive and the hooked-hand Salish is petrified with fear of also going there. There's also the US shore petrol who's attempting to board Kirk's craft looking for contraband. Kirk in fact has a number of creates of Cuban Cigirs which he all but consumed during the course of the movie.\n\nStill Captain Kirk and Salish take the happy college students to the island with the US Coast Guard headed by Capt.Casper, Ellie Cornell, following them there. Finding the place deserted the students find their way to this house where they run into the surviving students that were on the island led by Rudy, Jonathan Cherry, who also happens to be Alicia's former boyfriend.\n\nShown a video tape taken by Hugh, Michald Eklund, of the party, or rave, on the island being crashed by the rampaging zombies who killed everyone there. only Hugh Rudy and martial arts expert, which came in handy later in the movie, Liberty, Kira Clarvell, escaped by hiding in the house.\n\nThe makers of \"House of the Dead\" try to explain whats happening on the island \"The island of the Dead\" by showing us a flashback told by Captain Kirk of this crazed Spanish Padre Castillo, David Paiffy. Castillo was sentenced to death some 300 years ago for, here we go again, trying to create eternal life against the wishes of the church. Being shipped to a Spanish garrison on the Pacific coast he killed the entire crew of the ship St. Cristibol, after he was hung. Castillo then ran the ship aground on the island making himself the islands king as well as turning the natives into zombies. Who then killed anyone who happened to stray off course and on to his kingdom.\n\nThe movie has the zombies come out of the woods caves and even sea as they attacked Captain Kirk and the students, by the hundreds, all through the night with everyone being killed but Rudy and Alicia. In an underground cave they both run into Castillo, looking his age,with a gang of his zombies who end up being blasted by the trio. Later both Rudy and Alicia have it out with Castillo who loses his head after he runs a spear through Alicia's chest. Wounded and bleeding Alicia kills him by stepping on his disembodied skull crushing it UGH.\n\nAfter the carnage is over the good guys, police secret service CIA and FBI, come to Rudy's and Alicia's \"rescue\" who couldn't have been more happier not to be saved from the zombies but saved from being in this ridicules film any longer then they have to be.\n\nThere's one thing that really puzzled me about the ending of the movie \"The House of the Dead\" that has to do with Alicia. Being run through with a spear by the crazed Castillo you would have though that she would be dead but it seemed to have no lasting effects on her at all with the wound looking no worse then a mosquito bite. I have the feeling that Alicia is really a cryptic or underground zombie who when she, together with Rudy, gets back to the states will come alive, or dead, attacking the unsuspecting people there. Thus giving director Boll the reason to make a sequel to his movie calling it either \"Lifeless in Seattle\" or \"City of the Dead by the Sea\"."

I loved Army of Darkness, liked Resident Evil for the most part, and thought JASON X was a 10/10.\n\n\"Jason X a 10 out of 10!?\" You'd probably say, \"Your a horrible reviewer!\" But, hear me out. You have to take movies in the context of their goals, audience, and subject. You can't rate a Jason movie on the same scale your rating say, Amelie. Jason X was meant to be a funny, fun, slasher sequel and thats exactly what it was. It was truly entertaning and met its goals as its particular genre of film perfectly.\n\nThat said, House of the Dead was an eagerly anticipated 'fun' film for me. I knew it would be bad in the same vein Jason X is bad, that is, so bad it would be nothing but awesome. A few early reviews lead me to beleive this. So corny and stupid that it would be really fun to watch. Unfortunetly that was not the case :(.\n\nFrom start to finish this movie was a 40 million dollar peice of garbage. The script was unbarely stupid (in a bad way), the jokes were very stale and pointless, the acting horrible for even a B-Movie, and most of all, the execution on the directory's part was so ass-backwards one had to sit there slack-jawed in disbeleif. Clips from the video game were inserted randomly throughout the movie (yeah we know its based on the video game, we don't actually have to see the stupid video clips to get that point and draw us out of the movie every 10 minutes) and most of the matrix-esque effects (which could have been a laughably great part of the film) were inserted in the most pointless places and used in excess to the point of stupidity.\n\nThis movie had SO MUCH POTENTIAL. I was expecting to love it in all its cheesy glory but no. It was butchered horribly. This movie is not awesomely bad, its not even bad, its just plain horrible. I was honestly sick to my stomache after watching it. You'll probably end up seeing it (thats why your reading this review), but I plead with you to wait till it comes out on video, which will no doubt be soon since it will definetly bomb in the box office, and don't support this movie with your 8.50$. Watch Kill Bill instead, its well worth the money. Or 28 days later, thats a good zombie film.\n\nI would honestly like to slap everyone in the face who was involved with the production of this movie. 2/10"

All the horror movie clich\u00e9s were there: partying teens, killer zombies, mindless dialog, meandering script, screaming, carnage, etc. As the movie got even worse, a little subtitle in the corner of the screen announced the grim truth, \"Now: House of the Dead.\" I had heard this was awful; but the fullest extent of its awfulness had yet to assault me.\n\nFrom out of nowhere, the teens-in-peril find a cache of guns and ammo, and suddenly they act like Rambo on steroids, blasting ghouls by the hundreds. In the ensuing battle, those worn-out \"Matrix\" rip-off shots were used everywhere: the freeze-frame 360 degree \"virtual reality\" spin around a character, the slow-mo close-ups of bullets approaching their target, the projectile path illustrated in dizzying pans, etc.\n\nTo my shock and disbelief, some idiot was inserting quick cuts from the actual video-game. Once would have been pointless and irritating enough, but this insane technique was incessantly crammed down your throat until you felt ill.\n\nThe director was not even trying to make a movie, just a blast fest rehash of a video game. And a rotten effort of duplicating the game, at that. I did not vote a \"1\" on this because I laughed a few times at the ineptitude, but even there, it just barely achieved the so-bad-it's-funny status.\n\nIf you have a strong tolerance for bad movies in an MST3K sort of way, watch with friends, and hoot at it. That's the only way to actually enjoy this."

        "review_detailed_main": "In reviews of films or television shows I write, I usually try to find at least one good or redeeming thing to say... There has only been one past instance of my inability to do so (simply because there was no redeeming quality in the work I was reviewing), and I thought I would never run into this problem again. Well I have, and in a worse way than I could ever conceive of...\n\nThe allegedly video-game-based horror/action film \"House of the Dead\", from director Uwe Boll (first sign it is a terrible movie... it is from a director with multiple bottom-100 films, and has (so far) never made a movie that scored above a 5-average on IMDb) is honestly the worst of the worst.\n\nThe plot revolves around an evil Spanish man named Castillo, who created a blood serum years and years ago (because as we all know, the Spanish had genetic experimentation capabilities hundreds of years ago, or so director Boll would like us to think) that renders him immortal, and turns the deceased into brainless zombies that do his bidding. Or something equally as ludicrous. (Why the zombies immediately serve Castillo like dogs is never explained... because it can't be explained, it makes no sense.) Flash forward to now... A large group of kids are holding the \"rave of the century\" on a remote island (Yeah, sure... makes perfect sense), with no cell-phone reception, no residents, and no way to get help.\n\nOf course, it turns out Castillo runs the island and slaughters everyone with the aid of his minions.\n\nThen, the \"real heroes\" (I use that term loosely) show up, because they were conveniently late, and arrive on the island with a crazy old captain (named Captain Kirk, who also, conveniently, is an illegal gun runner with enough weapons to start a military coup) that was nice enough to give them a ride.\n\nFrom that point on, the kids realize what is going on; some of the more disposable characters (including several survivors who show up) are killed; and the movie takes off. They arm themselves with Kirk's insane amount of weapons, and rather than leave, decide to stay... why? I couldn't tell you, again it makes no sense.\n\nFrom then on, the movie degenerates into a cruddy shoot-'em-up-fest... And little else...\n\nNow, I don't want to ruin the riveting plot line, but I will say I never realized zombies know how to sword-fight and use kung-fu so well! Alright, enough of this merry synopsis, let's get down to the crap...\n\n-The worst acting I have seen in some time... Even for a horror film this is bad. Case in point... After seeing one of their best friends get killed, the characters simply stroll off, as though it was no big deal. Then, about five minutes later, one of them says \"Oh, I can't believe so-and-so died...\" and that is it. That is the depth of their emotional abilities as performers... One pathetic, short line and they are over a horrifying ordeal that should be a life-changing event. All I can say is... wow...\n\n-Terrible story and writing... I cannot say enough bad things about the script by Mark Altman and Dan Bates. It has the psychological depth of a Twinkie, and enough lame-brained (and very unfunny) one-liners to sink a ship.\n\n-Uwe's Direction... What truly sets this film apart from other awful films is the atrocity of the direction. Boll apparently tried to add glee and giddiness whilst directing. You can tell he thought he was making an awesome movie... even though he wasn't. He has the camera zoom, tilt, pan, dolly, fly and spin every opportunity he gets, and he tries to milk the (poorly choreographed) action for all it is worth. But Boll's fatal flaw is that he doesn't understand the concept of pace or being subtle. He simply throws shot after shot at the audience, and it gets boring really quick. He uses \"Matrix\" shots more than the actual \"Matrix\" movie, he constantly does this lame trick where the camera spins around the actors in slow motion, and for some reason, he thought mixing in a bunch of actual video game footage was a great idea. To be blunt, he simply can't direct action...\n\nIt is really apparent by the time the credits roll that Uwe Boll is without a doubt one of the worst directors of all time. I wouldn't even put him in a room with Ed Wood, as many suggest, because Wood's movies were so bad they became humorous, and that makes them work in a (unintended) sense. Boll's films are so bad, you feel like causing yourself bodily harm to distract yourself from the dim-witted images he tosses at you.\n\nOverall, I can say, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that \"House of the Dead\" is the worst movie I have ever seen... Honestly, for your own sake, avoid this at all costs! (Zero out of Ten)"

The \"house\" of the dead was more like a shack, the acting was far too awful to describe, and when it came time to killing zombies, they reverted to showing video game footage. Another thing that made my blood boil was that the best looking girl in the movie was killed off to early. Next time Uwe, base on the actual game itself and not this snooze-fest that put me to sleep."

Such movies have a high budget with big name actors, yet still end up in the dumpster. There are a lot of low quality trash movies to speak of, but the worst one in recent memory would have to be The House of the Dead. This movie was ludicrous in every way imaginable. Which brings me to ask, was this movie meant to be a joke?? I CANT BELIEVE IT MADE IT TO THEATERS!!!! Whoever was responsible for releasing this movie should be imprisoned, seriously. And I love zombie movies, I really do, but I could have made a better film on a monthly welfare check after buying groceries, some CDs, and a bottle of 12 year old scotch. As for the acting of the all no-name cast, let me put it this way, the acting was better in the video game. The characters were unbelievably stupid, yet somehow became experts at weaponry and warfare once guns were placed in their hands. Somehow, magically I presume, the humans managed to fight off hundreds of zombies with just a few clips of ammo. The zombies werent scary as most of them had better complexions than the average 15 year old boy. The plot had no substantiation or development, things just kind of happened randomly, the battle sequences were boring, and the end was unexciting and anticlimactic. Hell, the nudity could have even been better. This movie will be out on video very very soon. And God help us if they make any sequels. In Summary: Smelly pile of steaming vomit. A must see for those of you who still pour salt of slugs just to watch them die. All others stay away far away."

There is one funny bit in the movie, where a guy trying to rescue someone from zombies an he only manages to pull the top half through the window because the legs have been hacked off and eaten. She doesn't make it, and after that you can see he is very sad and shaken.. the acting is so bad at this point I had to laugh.\n\nThere is some unnecessary nudity in the beginning of the movie too.

It is a disaster with zero scares, dodgy acting, and some of the worst lines to ever be uttered on screen. It does these stop and rotate angles that do not work because by the time it gets to this fight scene you are already hoping the zombies have eaten them all. This is in my opinion the worst horror movie inhave ever seen. Watch at your own peril."

His camera work is amateurish and flat. One particular sequence almost made me seasick. At first, I thought it to be artistic shaky camera but it's more likely sea swell shaking the docks. His filming of the kills are really poor with no tension. It's got all the hallmarks of a bad B-movie. The zombie makeup is student level. The unimaginative story is flat and convoluted at the same time. The actors are mostly fine TV level workers but nobody is winning any awards in this one. The actresses have boobs and some of them show them off. You may recognize Erica Durance from Smallville. The bad movie list is almost entirely checked off. There are sequences of game play weirdly inserted into the movie to accentuate the Sega game. The spinning action scenes do nothing but get boring and dizzying. It's a Matrix wannabe fail.

Almost the whole movie takes place on a deserted island where supposedly there was supposed to be \"the party of the year\" but there's nothing more then a little camp site, with a little stage. This movie is total garbage and doesn't have one bit of entertainment value whatsoever. Great game, terrible movie."

And really, how hard is it to make a zombie movie? The whole video game homage thing going on was weak as a concept, much less in execution. I saw on the \"Man on Fire\" comment board that people were claiming that as the worst movie ever... seriously, they must be watching only the best cinema out there if they think Denzel's latest foray holds a candle to this bag of pus. (sigh) I know a LOT of aspiring filmmakers who would have loved to have even a tenth of the cash they blew on this movie, and could turn out quite a decent flick in return..."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is a perfect example of one of the films which is bottom of the barrel. Its story line is painfully lackluster and its actors aren't the best in a long line of acting names, even the names in the roster for community theater. The plot is somewhat simplistic and it does little to justify the film as a whole. \"House of the Dead\" is the generic 'college kids go to island and are attacked by monsters' drivel which we've seen for ages yet. It revolves around a group of college students going to a raver on an island and expect good times, but find nothing more than the dead coming to life and attacking them left and right. It seems that these creatures attack for no known reason. While the effects are quite the thing to behold, it seems clear that the rest of the film is not the best...even of the worst. Finally, though the film has a few gunslinging moments that are not to be missed, it is ultimately somewhat forgettable when it comes to horror stories. Or sci-fi stories. Or action- adventure stories...or any story."

The policy is to never walk out of a film - you never know it may get better. OK so that didn't happen on this occasion.\n\nFor those of you who haven't seen this film, it is about a group of rich students who want to go to a rave on an island and it turns out there are a bunch of dead guys killing everyone. To be honest with you... that's about as far as the plot goes. The acting in this film is dire. It is full of poor one liners and cheesy lines. So many flaws: OK, these students get a lift with a fisherman who is wanted by this cop woman for smuggling weapons - SMUGGLING WEAPONS! He had 3 wooden boxes each with 1 gun in! They were going to what was supposed to be the biggest rave of the century - there looked like there was about 12 people there - I've had bigger garden parties!\n\nBefore I saw this movie someone said to me - it's dawn of the dead meets The Matrix - how I laughed. The reference to the matrix is bullet time - really bad bullet time at that, and the reference to Dawn of the Dead is dead people. This movie had lots of killing of dead people - the fighting scenes were so messy - they were just a series of close ups all muddled up with some bullet time thrown in.\n\nI have a UGC Unlimited card so was not too riled by the fact that I saw this film however, I feel sorry for any paying cinema goer who paid six English pounds to see this drivel!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Oh. My. God. This movie was terrible - even worse than I expected. At least they got the gratuitous nudity in early on, and Clint Howard made his seventeen zillionth cameo - but holy CRAP, that was terrible.\n\nThe friggin' cuts to scenes from the House of the Dead Sega game were mystifying... as in, \"Why the heck did they put those shots of the game in the film? Was it to show us that at least the VIDEO GAME had some moments of suspense? UGH!\"\n\nBoll clearly does NOT understand pacing, how to establish mood, or even how to build up a feeling of dread within the viewer, knowing that something bad is going to happen, but not expecting when. Lemme tell ya, something BAD happened, all right - this movie got MADE in the first place!\n\nI really don't know where to begin describing how horrible this thing was - the score seemed to be written by the same guy that did the Scooby Doo cartoons, and since there was a Scooby Doo reference in the flick, I wouldn't be surprised if that was indeed the case. In the big fight scene with all the stupid 360 degree shots (yup, another Matrix/Bullet Time steal), the zombies would (in most cases) just walk past \"our heroes\", I suppose to go after other, more well-armed prey - yep, the ones that would be better suited to blow their heads off.\n\nEven opportunities that the \"director\" had to give us some cheap scares (like when the lady cop was under the blanket - I figured for SURE she'd crawl out from it and attack \"Curien\" and his woman), he chose not to. Or when \"Liberty\" or the black girl are killed, you think that perhaps they will join the zombie hordes, but nope, they just stay dead, never to reappear.\n\nOf course, the dialogue was completely laughable - there are so many examples to cite, that I can't even specify one, although that \"here's an old book - maybe it will help us\" was particularly memorable. The makeup was probably left over from school projects Tom Savini did when he was in Kindergarten. Oh, and the stunts and action scenes? It looks like everyone that goes to a rave is an action star that \"knows kung fu\" - heck, even the ZOMBIES seemed to know their martial arts. Let's not forget the foreshadowing - one of the first lines Rudy Curien says is that he broke up with his girlfriend to concentrate on his studies, and so she could focus on her fencing. \"I don't see how that's useful\", he tells us, and it was pretty obvious that her fencing \"skills\" would come up later in the film. I was right, but when watching that scene, I thought to myself, \"looks like she needs a LOT more training!\". Of course, when they show the group of friends during his voice-over, he mentions that they're all dead now - which is an EXCELLENT way of establishing dramatic tension. Not that you could possibly care for these characters, as it is... even if his ex-g.f. was amply endowed.\n\nAnyhow, I could go on, but I've wasted enough of my life on this film. Yes, the two hours I've spent watching and then immediately typing out this stern warning is already too much. Fortunately, I didn't have to pay to rent it - it's on my digital cable movie package this month. Mind you, I think I would have demanded a refund of my rental money as well as the gas to get to and from the video store had I actually rented this tripe. Either that, or forced the video store clerks to WATCH this crap a la Malcolm McDowell in \"A Clockwork Orange\" - but that would have been just cruel. Really, the person who should have been forced to watch this in that fashion SHOULD be Uwe Boll, with a roomful of disgruntled moviegoers asking him every two seconds this pertinent question:\n\n\"WHAT WERE YOU THINKING??\"\n\nYeesh."

        "review_detailed_main": "House Of The Dead (2004)\n\nThis movie begins with this group of friends who get a ride on a boat to an island for a rave. When they arrive there, they find no one and meet up with a cop, Jordan Casper (Ellie Cornell- Halloween 4 & 5), and a group of other people who where at the rave when walking dead zombies murdered everyone, turning them into zombies and multiplying there kind. The group fights the zombies with all the weapons they can (mostly guns), and barricade themselves in a house on the island.\n\nThis movie has mostly ideas that have been recycled over and over again. It uses Romero's Night of the Living Dead premise, where the gang is locked inside the house with zombies trying to break in. Director Uwe Boll adds in clips of the video game in between shots to remind us of the film's basis, which is pretty dull if you think about it, but it gives it a bit of a unique edge. The acting is mostly horrible, except for Jonathan Cherry (Final Destination 2, They) and Clint Howard, but the rest of the actors are your basic Friday the 13th stupid teenagers who can't act their way out of a paper bag. The movie serves up a lot of gore, so it makes up for some of it's flaws. I hope to see a bit better from Uwe Boll in his upcoming \"Alone In The Dark\" film that is, again based on a video game.\n\nAll in all, the story is overused and getting dull, the acting is mostly terrible, the dialogue is dumb, but it's still one of those movies you can still like for what it is, despite it's flaws. It can be enjoyable, just don't take it seriously. 6/10."

The story has absolutely nothing in common with the game except for the fact that there are zombies. The only reason you know it's a video game adaptation of House of the Dead because they annoyingly use gameplay clips of the games too much. The characters were just stupid and had absolutely no personality even though the movie tries to force-feed their personalities to you at the start of the movie. The acting was just diabolical, I've seen much better acting with kids pulling a sickie to try and get the day off school. The directing is just absolutely dire and the writing is terrible.\n\nThis is possibly one of the worst zombie movies I have ever seen. Even the action scenes were unappealing and too Matrix-y. I also hated the fact that all of the characters suddenly knew how to fight, every single one of them were pulling off kung-fu moves here, there and everywhere and they suddenly learned how to fire a gun and reload fast and how to use a sword. If you thought the voice-over guy in the trailer was bad, it has nothing on the dialogue. The dialogue, the script and the direction was a total nonsense. The acting was just horrible from start to finish, it felt like a terrible no-budget horror movie that you bought from Poundland. It's just rubbish. It was boring, it didn't bring nothing new or special to the table, it didn't follow the game at all\u0085an utter waste of my time. The most irritating thing about the movie was the fact that it was meant to be a video game adaptation and yet it didn't follow the games at all, not even the characters were named after them. The only way you knew that it was House of the Dead and not something else was the constant, annoying gameplay footage being shown through the game whenever a zombie was nearby or when an action scene was coming up. I really can't see anybody liking this whatsoever. If you like absolutely terrible, cheesy horror movies then you might like this but even then, you might hate it. I've seen better, MUCH better.\n\nRead more reviews on: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com"

The cop lady takes out her \"stainless steel\" shotgun with explosive rounds and shows it off to everyone else. Then, Captian Kirk opens his crate where he has a \"small\" arsenal. The black chick reaches in and grabs a handgun, where after Kirk says \"Desert Eagle, I like the way you think.\" After, we go through a small montage of each character reaching into Kirk's endless crate of weapons and taking something. They pulled out chain-linked bullets, but never a chain-gun. We see one of the characters take some grenades and strap them to her belt. It always surprises me that the US Army spends millions training its troops in proper grenade use but drunk teen-age girls going to a wave already know how. In fact, the characters in this movie strap themselves so full with weapons like sub-machine guns and TNT sticks but never really use them. This scene sucks all the masculinity out of guns that after when I was watching Scarface the last scene wasn't very exciting for me. \"House of the Dead\" is not only a movie that destroys itself, it also destroys every other movie you'll see. It a cinema-virus."

This all leads to a truly awful pacing where you don't care at all about anyone, your not scare, or invested or waiting to see what happens next. You just want this to end because you are bored beyond belief. The story is very basic and the one thing to credit this is there is at least a bare bone flow of story albeit filled with terrible storytelling elements the whole way but at least there is a plot and the camera is tuned on.

In a forest scene,you\n\nactually see the springboard that is launching a zombie into the air for his super- zombie jumping ability. I even spotted the damn dolly track that the camera was on! The Matrix shots were overused to the point of irritability, and the director even openly called them \"Matrix shots\" in the commentary (nope, I only listened to a little bit). There are even shots from the actual game intercut as transtion points. That has got to be a new ultimate low. I've heard that Uwe Boll has his own production company. That's the only explanation I can think of, as to why this guy is even in the entertainment industry. This made House of 1000Corpses and the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre look Oscar worthy. 1/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "House of The Dead was the title of a famous video game developed by Rikya Nakagawa of SEGA. The game was designed as a first-person shooter, but what made it stand out from titles such as DOOM and QUAKE was that it was done in arcade format, known to many as the light gun, where rather than sitting back with a controller, the user can hold a gun within his/her own hands and try their best to survive against a horde of undead. This, along with the graphics, the obscene creatures and violence, made the game very popular. The story revolved around two government agents wearing trench coats investigating a mansion, where experiments conducted on zombies goes awry. Curiously, this came out at the same time with Resident Evil, which was more atmospheric.\n\nNow comes the film. Originally DreamWorks had the license, but later lost the rights, which were promptly bought by MINDFIRE's Mark Altman, who would serve as the co-writer and producer of this film. At first I was excited, for I loved Free Enterprise, which Altman had co-written with the director. Later, there were advertisements that showed a Robert Deniro-like zombie licking a girl's face, a scene that could have chilled the audience. However, after watching the film, this viewer, along with many others, emerged disappointed. The plot made absolutely no sense, the acting was poor, and although at times the creatures looked decent, Boll's lighting and directing made them laughable. What further weakened the film was the inclusion of video game footage and MATRIX shots, followed by scenes that were supposedly made to scare the audience. It's almost as if director Uwe Boll hadn't wanted to make a good film; rather, he just wanted to dazzle his audience. His interviews amusingly denied that it was a poorly-made film, making both this garbage and Boll even more pretentious than one would dare to attribute. As a fan of the games, one cannot help but miss the memorable nemeses that were in the game, particularly bosses like the Chariot and the Magician. As a fan of films, I'd occasionally enjoy a cheesy (and sometimes retarded) film, but with Boll's less than stellar hand, this film almost seemed to be a tragedy, for it could have been a fun horror film like EVIL DEAD. I do not deny that Boll is a movie fan, I only question his ability to direct.\n\nAs a side-note, the writer's commentary on the DVD was interesting, for it explained what he had wanted to write. One could not help but feel sorry that his script was given to such an awful director, and that it had such a low budget, for it sounded quite promising. However, Altman does manage to redeem himself with the more mindlessly enjoyable HOUSE OF THE DEAD 2. Boll, on the other hand, continues to do video game adaptations, which includes FAR CRY, BLOODRAYNE, ALONE IN THE DARK, Dungeon Siege, and POSTAL, where in a bizarre publicity stunt he challenged his critics to a boxing match."

It was no surprise for me to find that it ranked in the bottom 100 on IMDb.\n\nI enjoy many zombie movies, so it's not that I just don't like the genre. There is honestly nothing good that I can say about this one. The acting and script was cheesy, especially the character on the boat that wears the yellow raincoat. I kept waiting for one of the other characters to throw him off the boat.\n\nThey included clips of the video game it was based on at various points for no reason. Maybe they wanted to remind everyone that it was based on a video game ... Maybe they wanted to make the movie another five minutes longer ...\n\nI also found the zombie fight scenes to be extremely terrible. Several times they show the scenes in slow motion (a la The Matrix).\n\nAnother annoying point is that the show the zombies grab a tree about 8 times in the movie. Why do that?\n\nIf you want to watch a zombie movie, watch Shaun of Dead (10/10) or Dawn of the Dead (8/10). Both are excellent alternatives"

I'm not sure why Mr. Boll put in shots from the game to make it look as if he stayed true to the plot, since he really didn't at all. In the game the character was some sort of government agent trying to save scientists in a house full of zombies created by an evil genius. The sad part is, this premise is arguably much better than the abomination Uwe turned it into. He threw out anything that likened it to its virtual counterpart. My guess is he put in the clips just to remind gamers why went to see this piece of crap."

The plot revolves, much like the video game, around a group of young people traveling to a \"cursed\" island. When the group reaches the island they find that all the party-goers have dissapeared and soon find themselves fighting off the most poorly constructed zombies of all time. People watching this movie in 1950 would probably have complained about how lame the special effects are. The plot is worse than that of BW 2 and to top it all off the frequently flash to scenes, from the video game, of zombies being shot. The only thing scarier than this movie is the thought of having to watch it again."

Take 10 dollars from you wallet (what I paid in theaters) and use it as toilet paper and you get the same feeling as watching House Of The Dead. I saw this movie and I wish I could make Uwe Boll give me my time and money back! For the first half of the movie it's 30 year olds with no acting ability playing teenagers going to a rave in a remote island. And they all have sex, get high, and zombie kill them off screen. In the second half the survivors get guns and every scene is in slow motion and they show a 360-camera pan as soon a shot is fired. It starts ripping off the Matrix for the rest of the movie. They threw in some decent gore too late in the movie. Somehow despite the gore (very late in the movie) and the nudity it was a boring movie that is painful to watch. Al least Ed Wood's films were fun to make fun of. But this is no laughing matter.\n\nUwe Boll if you read this review I demand you refund us the money we wasted, and stop making movies for the good of humanity. After seeming this movie and reading about a sequel in the works I believe (jokingly) Uwe Boll is the Antichrist."

        "review_detailed_main": "Uwe Boll has taken what could have been a great horror movie and turned it into a textbook example of how to create a truly atrocious licensed movie.\n\nThe writing in House of the Dead is so bad you will be rooting for the zombies, if for no other reason than they don't talk. The dialog varies between gratuitous and painful, with the occasional welcome sprinkle of unintelligible. Characters frequently exceed the normal stupidity found in most zombie movies, often deciding to run into the massive horde of undead instead of away from them. Of course, while the undead vary quite widely from the tree-leaping lupine zombies to the slow, lumbering, and kind-of-lost zombies, they are by far Hollywood's least threatening monsters. They are so weak they can be felled by a single bullet, and even lose several knife fights. Forget about smashing through walls, these zombies can't even push over small pieces of wood blocking windows.\n\nOK, so the writing is atrocious, the plot is terrible, and the zombies are paper-thin. But at least there is a great, grand house like in the videogames, and is beautifully filmed to take maximum effect from each scene, right? Sadly, no. While in the videogames the house of the dead could easily be described as a mansion, here it is a tiny and run-down two-room affair... An outhouse of the dead, if you will. Even the now-infamous shots of the house spliced in from the videogames look more convincing. And yes, the movie makers do splice in shots from the video game. And every time a character dies they get a death animation stolen from Resident Evil. And they use the Matrix special effect about 30 times. Even if you discount these atrocious effects, the normal cinematography is still so bad Gilbert Godfried would be ashamed to show it on USA's Up All Night. The only visual effects that really worked were of the zombie's exploding heads, which while not terrifying were surprisingly satisfying.\n\nWe came into this fully expecting a bad movie, only to be surprised by the true depth this movie achieves. Characters throw up on each other. Zombies swim. People arrive at an empty rave full of blood-soaked clothing and immediately have sex. Within the first 30 minutes no fewer than six breasts had been exposed. Did I mention that zombies lose knife fights? If you're looking for a truly awful movie, look no further. This is it. This is the standard by which all bad movies will be judged in the future."

This was so terrible I couldn't believe it. All of the reviews on here that I have read don't even give it justice. It is so bad that you can't even write a review bad enough to justify it. Everything that could go wrong in a movie has gone wrong here. The acting and story, or lack there of, were horrible. The Director should be shot. I know everyone hates Uwe Boll, but I ask how a man like this becomes a Director. I have no Director experience what so ever and I am positive that I can do better than this. I can not believe this was made. The best parts of the movie were the video game sequences (sarcasm). Who decided to throw those in? They should be banned from movies forever. I think that we should start McCarthyism all over again and black list anyone who had anything to do with this movie. To sum up in a few words: No matter how much you like to laugh at B Movies, this is too bad for even that kind of enjoyment. Stay away."

There is no easy way to explain how bad this movie was. It was so bad that twice during the movie, the theater where I was at decided to stop the film by turning the houselights on... Perhaps just to see how many people were walking out... or perhaps just to help out those who were trying to leave... get out. Not only did the storyline bite chunky pancake dough... but the \"actors\" just weren't acting. The very first line in the movie kills it for everybody in the theater. You are NOT supposed to start a movie off by having a guy say \"If only they wouldn't have come... they would still be alive\"... You just don't say that. Sega... how could you? You've made absolute fools of yourselves (Sega seemed to have sponsored the \"Rave of the Year\" where this whole thing took place). And if you're going to make a movie based off a game.. please.. pleaaaaaaaaaase... don't use clips from the game within the movie. And if you're going to use bullet time... don't use it for more than a total minutes of 30 seconds in a fight scene. The only reason I can possibly think of for this movie being so insipidly stupid... was that they were trying to get the most mistakes for moviemistakes.com on opening weekend. One scene that really stood out was near the end. If you watch carefully, when the two 'survivors' are running out of the underground cave lab thing ... it's day... when the lab blows up a second later... it's night... when they show the two characters talking after that.. it's still night... but then when the evil dude comes running out after them.. it's day again. I've seen bad movies.. and I must say, this is the WORST movie I've ever seen. I knew something was wrong when the opening credits involved a Photoshop'ed (chopped? After Effects? nah.. most probably Videowave...) series of clips from the game itself. The only good thing about the entire movie were the boobie shots... and maybe the few little jokes that were \"hidden\" in the dialogue (dude to chick: \"It looks like it's gonna rain.. we'd better get inside before we get wet\" girl:\"Too late...\") Just.. don't watch it.. if you absolutely must watch a bad b-movie... watch House of a 1000 Corpses... atleast that one has a really nice execution scene. As I understand... Alone in the Dark is being made by this same company. Let's just hope it's not as bad as House of the Dead. And if everything goes well... we'll have a Silent Hill movie on our hands soon."

A House of the Dead movie?! Oh god! And one of the comments says, \"The Dawn of the Dead meets The Matrix\". Right, that's it, I'm buying this! This was the excited hysteria that followed me finding this movie. You see, I am a HUGE fan of The House Of The Dead video game. I didn't even know this movie existed. I also like old zombie movies. I also like the Matrix. However, unknowingly, I had made one the worst mistakes of my film watching life.\n\nSo, here I am, at home. I put the DVD in my player, and as the interactive menu appears, I hear the voice-over man from the original arcade game saying, \"The House.... OF THE DEAD.\" A buzz of nostalgia washes over me. So, I press select, and the film starts playing. For the next 87 minutes, I was in a depressed, suicidal state.\n\nHow could they do this to a legendary game? Make it a pile of trash? How could I describe this movie in three words? How about this movie sucks. The \"special\" effects look like they've been thrown together by a confused four year old. I've seen acting superior acting to this in a porn film. The entire film is so frustratingly hard to understand, that you feel like tearing your hair out. The plot is one of the very worst I've encountered. The entire film is a crying shame. And would throwing in a bunch of clips from the game completely at random make it any better, even for a die hard House Of The Dead fan like me? No. In fact, it makes it even worse, seeing your favourite game reduced to nothing. The cast are complete unknowns, (sometimes, this can be to a films advantage, e.g 28 Days Later, Blair Witch Project, but it makes it worse here)it has zilch production values and the director (Uwe Boll) is well known for his trashy game to film conversions.\n\nIn fact, I've done a little research on Uwe Boll, and I've found this. He has made SEVEN game to film conversions. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM IS CONSIDERED COMPLETE TRASH. And guess what? He's planning to make another three.\n\nThe message is clear: DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE. House Of The Dead fans, don't be tempted by the name. Watching this will only make your love of the game shrink."

Two games I would say are the some of the most fun to play light-gun games IF you have a light-gun to play them with (do not bother playing with gamepad, mouse or keyboard, trust me, I have tried). So despite the games having flaws such as bad graphics, minimalist story (there only for backdrop to the game), and really bad translations of the characters lines (f.ex. \"Don't come!\" when a girl is approached by a zombie), the lines are so bad some of them become really funny (unlike the movie). But amid all this the game was actually FUN to play, you know FUN? Like games are supposed to be. So a game is not like a movie, a game is supposed to be fun to play and does not need a story, it merely needs to be fun to play with, plots are unnecessary really.\n\nI was genuinely surprised when I heard of this movie, since the game series it was based on had almost no story to speak of, I mean the basic plot from the game was just loosely this: (this is from the game, not the movie, so no spoilers, sorry) You, a type of investigator/cop (It's and your partner are sent out to some town, you see zombies, you save some people, evil scientist and later evil dictator-type makes zombies using green stuff, you save the day. End plot. I really did not think one could make a movie with so little to base it on, so I was exited to be able to see how it would come out...\n\nI CAN NO LONGER PLAY THE GAME!!! Because it reminds me of the movie.\n\nThis movie was so.. horrible that it hurts trying to think about it.\n\nThe worst part is that I can not pinpoint what really made it so bad. The acting is mediocre, but i have loved films with worse acting. The scenery/props is/are nice and leaves no negative remarks visually (the style/condition of some of the props on tables remind me of Evil Dead for some reason). The location has NOTHING to do with the games. The characters are even less likable then the ones from the game. The plot is altered for the worse. And probably some other things I am currently suppressing from memory.\n\nConclusion: DO NOT WATCH, it will ruin your chance to enjoy the games."

The writing was awful, acting was even worse (The zombies acting wasn't bad though), and the use of the Matrix style filming was over done...and done badly. Any positive at all in this movie? Well, the zombies were cool, some good nudity, and some nice bloody effects. But in the end, this is one of the worse movies I have ever seen, which turn out to be a poor excuse for a long commercial for SEGA and the House of the Dead video games."

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't know where to start... First there is the plot or lack of one. A rave party on an island being raided by zombies and the survivors must fight their way out. There is no story at all. No characters. You don't get to no much about these people. Who is the one main character this bad excuse for a movie is all about? I have no idea. You don't relate to them in any way. There is a voice over by a guy. The one guy you no less about. The one man you get to no most about is really the captain and he has nothing to do with it! It's not a good written story. The dialog is just silly and stupid.\n\nThen there is the total lack of logic. The characters act total illogical in certain situation, and the situations them selves are weird as well. For instance, a bunch of rich teenagers that have never seen a fight and much less fired a weapon, suddenly becomes martial art masters and state of the art marksmen... The actors does a less good job and as for the directing... Uwe Boll does a great job in making this a horrible movie. Using clips from the computer game as transitions and short clips of monsters running in the forest. It's a nice try, but sorry it doesn't work! The music in it self is not so bad, but it just doesn't fit this movie and it contradicts the rest of the mood in the film. Not that there is much mood and atmosphere, though. It is not scary or tense or anything in any way. You don't get any feelings.\n\nOne thing I did kind of like was the lightning. This was at times good and there was a couple of nice shots, but over all the cinematography was nothing out of the ordinary. The special effects was also among the better things in this movie. It was, however, nothing extraordinary.\n\nNow, why should you see this film? Well, you shouldn't. I mean it! This is one of those movies you just don't need to watch no matter how bored you are. The only excuse to watch it is if you are a die hard horror or video game made into film fan. Then you might consider it."

Uwe boll, i hope you do more with your next two planned films especially for the sake of christian slater who is set to star in your next outing. The only analogy i could come up with for you releasing this film, is a 400 lb man eating 8 dominoes pizzas, 4 bags of cheetos, a tub of crisco and 10 lbs of chili, then running into the bathroom..and following a thunderous explosion, inviting the world in to see the remains! Keep it to yourself next time Uwe, i think the world would have negotiated and paid you NOT to release the movie..i know i would have shucked out 8 dollars instead of the 3.99 i paid to rent this horrid movie from hollywood video tonight by the way i will be returning it tomorrow first thing for my dollar credit for an early return Thank you Uwe for ruining my night!"

This is the worst movie I have ever seen my whole life. Do not waste your time on this movie.\n\nI tend to like a lot of movies and I am really not a hard critic, but this doesn't even fall into the \"its so bad we should watch this because its bad\" category, it actually made me angry to watch this. If you think \"Well with all these bad reviews, I have to at least see how bad it was to know what I was missing\" - No. DON'T do this to yourself."
