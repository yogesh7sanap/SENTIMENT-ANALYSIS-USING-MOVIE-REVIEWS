        "review_detailed_main": "My friend and I were looking for a movie to see in the theater yesterday, everything I saw she didn't ad everything she saw I didn't, but one movie we didn't see was I Know Who Killed Me. We never heard of it, we actually for a minute didn't wanna see it because Lindsay Lohan was in it, but eventually we were just like \"What the heck?\". We needed a couple hours to kill and had free movie tickets that we got as a gift. So after seeing I Know Who Killed Me, I just was thinking of how much of a strange movie this was, but at the same time I didn't think it was all that bad, there were some things left unexplained and the ending was pretty lame, but I think over all, this was a thriller with good potential and just needed a little pick-me-up.\n\nAubrey is a good girl who has strong potential to be a good writer and piano player, she has a good life, good home, loving parents, good friends, and a loving boyfriend. One night though, she is kidnapped and brutally tortured. Someone finds her on the road, but when Aubrey is picked up and taken to the hospital, she says she's not Aubrey, she's Dakota Moss, a stripper with a dirty life who has no idea what's going on, but she's not Aubrey. Is this a story that she's believing too much? Is this a possible side effect from being traumatized? Is this something from the drugs the killer was making her take? Or is she even right? Is it a possibility that she really isn't Aubrey? Everyone calls her crazy and just tries to make her believe that she is Aubrey, but Dakota searches for the truth and wants answers.\n\nLike I said, I Know Who Killed Me turned out to be a little surprise of a film, I liked it personally, there were things that were confusing, but over all I think the plot kept me guessing and going. Lindsay I would say did a good job, but the strip scenes at times were a little too much, just because we all know her personal life, so I think it would make us a little uncomfortable. There are some flaws to the film, but I wouldn't say to stay away, just keep your mind open and you might find yourself liking it.\n\n5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "So I just went to go see an advance screening of this movie and I don't know why the studio would do such a thing-- the audience was constantly laughing and this is no comedy. Usually screenings I've seen have been of fantastic movies (Wedding Crashers, Hairspray) and I'm telling everyone I know to go see it. Also, I've never seen such a general consensus of \"WOW, what were they thinking?\" at the end of a movie. I cannot WAIT to read the reviews on this! It's going to be slaughtered by the press.\n\nDespite Ms. Lohan's troubles, I do think she is talented and, if only for her sake, I was hoping this would be a good film. I like her, and I love movies and tend to see the good in them, but this does not do enough redeeming. It does have a promising premise, but it is done all wrong. The parts that need build-up have none and time is wasted on other pointless scenes. Very graphic film as well-- definitely not an R that any child should be seeing.\n\nSeriously, this isn't even a case of \"so bad it's good\". It's just bad.\n\nSave yourself the $10 movie fare on this one-- and go see \"1408\" for a real psychological thriller. This'll be on DVD before you know it anyway."

        "review_title": "Could have been better...",
        "review_detailed_main": "Really, it could have.\n\nMy personal opinion of Lohan aside, this movie - like others (Dead Silence for one) relied heavily on effects that at times, become quite distracting. Some of the shots in the film are beautiful, but the use of blue is really overdone, some of the special effects are lacking, and some of the weapons are just ridiculous (The big blue glass knife? Are you kidding me?). Whether you see symbolism in the use of colour depends on the viewers mindset - But even so, the use of blue is just overwhelming at times. This is probably the point - but it starts to distract from the plot.\n\nThe acting is alright. For the most part, Lohan does a good job. The parents aren't very convincing, and at times the dialog becomes stale, and somewhat corny.\n\nHowever, the movie is easy enough to follow that people who don't like complex horror films can sit back, and enjoy the ride. If you do prefer a bit more mystery, you'll have this figured out about halfway through, and the end will seem to drag. The big plot twist at the end was original enough, however for me it seemed like a cop out. It works fine, it's just not quite as exciting as it could have been. Kind of left me thinking \"Oh... that's all?\"\n\nThere's a small bit of nudity, a sex scene, and lots of dirty dancing. So if your decision rests on one of those things, now you know.\n\nSurprisingly, there are several gory scenes as well. I wouldn't recommend bringing small children to see this, though I doubt that will stop some people from bringing their kids along. It isn't scary, but the gore in some parts might be a bit much for younger audiences, or people who really can't deal with it. It's nothing like SAW or Hostel in the area of gore, but there were a couple scenes that made me flinch.\n\nIn the end, the film really didn't bring anything new to the table. The storyline is simple, and easy to follow, some of the shots are nice, and the acting on a whole is mediocre at worst. So if you have nothing better to do, it's an alright film to waste an hour or so with. But don't go expecting an award winner - you'll be left disappointed."

        "review_detailed_main": "That's right, my girlfriend turned to me in the movie and said, \"I think BarbWire was better than this.\" Her opinion and mine seemed to carry through to the whole audience in the advance screening we went to last night. The audience was laughing at the horrible acting, terrible script and crap camera work.\n\nSpecifics: Lohan works in a strip club where women are topless, yet she never takes the top off and even in sheer bra has pasties on (or were the pasties on top of the bra?). I could care less about seeing her naked, but if you are playing a stripper you might have to at least imply nudity with well placed hands.\n\nSomeone decided to inject humor into the movie into the most awkward places. The biggest problem was trying to figure out why people were laughing more during the \"serious parts\" than the \"funny parts\".\n\nCharacters come in, spout some wisdom and disappear behind a rock like the Dungeon Master. I have a feeling that they are supposed to be angels, maybe God himself?\n\nThe twists in the movie are tough to swallow. I will not even come close to ruining them, they are not even worth ruining. Someone thought they could write a M. Knight script, but failed.\n\nOverall, this movie would be worth a rental from the dollar kiosk at the grocery store, as long as everything else is sold out. I am glad I got in for free. If you do decide to spend money to see this movie, send me the cash instead, I will then hit you in the groin, you will enjoy it more."

A few weeks ago, I saw a preview of this film that gave no indication of it's true nature. This, plus the intriguing poster led me to believe this was going to be a brooding drama in the Hitchcock tradition. Instead, I found myself watching the ugliest, most disgusting film I have ever attended of my own free will. I should have guessed when the cashier gave me a funny look while getting my ticket.\n\nThe first thing I realized was the script was by an amateur. The scenes and dialog jumping around with no thought or subtlety. Like other reviewers, I knew who the torturing villain was within the first few minutes. But, I still had to sit through several scenes of dismemberment and pain, which made me sick. Sick that I had spent money to watch this disaster.\n\nI can't imagine why Lindsay Lohan would agree to be in this production. There are other venues to stretch her acting talents. Neal McDonough and Julia Ormond's rent must have been due.\n\nThe story, such as it is has at it's core an interesting premise. A top director might have made a respectable film out of it with a total rewrite, without the gore and more atmosphere.\n\nThis movie is an absolute, total disaster. No one involved has anything to be proud of."

EVERYTHING within this film is bad - the scary parts aren't scary (or even remotely suspenseful), the dialogue is awful, the acting is questionable at best, and, I am very sorry to say that Lindsay Lohan's stripping/ sex scenes were not sexy at all. On top of everything else, the killer was obvious and the plot didn't even make a whole lot of sense. Even the quality of film used is inferior to the type normally used (yes, you can tell).\n\nSome films are so bad they're good. This film was just SO BAD.\n\nDon't wait for the DVD.

        "review_detailed_main": "My friend won tickets to a pre release showing of this movie in Boston. I went into the theater with absolutely no idea what it would be about and with no preconceived notions. I left the theater feeling confused and thankful that I hadn't actually paid to see it.\n\nThis film takes every thriller movie clich\u00e9 in the book and slathers it on ad nauseam. I'm not opposed to a good clich\u00e9 thriller movie, but at some point it becomes comical. The plot was extremely contrived and had enough holes to fill the Royal Albert Hall. Perhaps the scenes explaining the plot ended up on the cutting room floor in favor of some of the more grotesque and gratuitous gore scenes (of which there were plenty). The film's twist, one so ludicrous even the most die-hard Lohan films will giggle, is pulled directly from left field after a seemingly magical epiphany by the film's main character. The filmmakers thrown in a plethora of minor characters with undeveloped and unresolved story lines in an attempt to \"throw off\" the audience. Nevertheless, not ten minutes into the film, I, along with the others I was with, had successfully predicted the antagonist.\n\nThe final thirty minutes of the film was a non-stop laugh riot. The packed theater of varying demographics was rolling in the aisles as clich\u00e9 after hackneyed clich\u00e9 flew off the screen in rapid succession to hilarious results. I joked to the person beside me that I hadn't laughed as hard since the first time I saw \"Borat\".\n\nStylistically, the movie is a film school student's wet dream rife of \"artsy\" shots and recurring motifs. Unfortunately, for the audience, this does little to redeem from the film's most blaring flaw: it's entire premise.\n\nIt's difficult to fairly critique the film's actors given what they had to work with. I can say that Lohan's performance seemed rather bland and stale throughout, as though in the back of her mind she knew the movie was trite and looked at it more as a paycheck than a serious mark on her resume.\n\nAside from the occasional, \"I almost died laughing when....\", I heard scarcely a good comment in the lobby after the film. As a horror-comedy this film might have actually been good, but as a thriller it missed the mark entirely."

The murder of the father was merely implied, and the entire movie lacked all major detail. Also, how does the lady cop get everything right all the time?? Its like a bad episode of CSI. I really enjoyed LL's acting, I am a huge fan of Neal McDonough as well. I just wonder if this movie looked better on paper than it was portrayed on film."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie came at the height of Lindsay's legal troubles so it was disregarded as an awful film at the time of release I remember, but I honestly consider this to be one of Lindsay Lohan's best films when it comes to darker and more serious work as an actress minus her comedy and family-friendly roles. For me this film has improved with age. It was not released at a time that it would have been found relevant.\n\nWhat was partly misunderstood about this film was it was marketed as a serious horror film that was intended to be frightening but instead it is more of a David Lynch and Twin Peaks kind of thing with an ambiguous ending and a mystery / crime storyline more than a horror one.\n\nThis film captivates me each time I give it a watch. I would have liked Lindsay to explore more edgy roles in her past career during this time. The ending is quite eerie because it could almost go either way.\n\nI think this film is not as bad as Lindsay's Legal troubles would tell you it is. For someone like myself not looking to hate it, or hate on the actress/actors, I find it an enjoyable crime mystery. One of Lindsay's better roles for a more mature minded audience.\n\nI know some would find it ridiculous anyone could genuinely enjoy this movie. But it is just such a wacky premise and the themes are deliberate. It's competently acted, and the ending that didn't sit well at first, has improved with age.\n\nI think it's unfortunate that audiences didn't appreciate this film, but seeing as it has improved with age, and has kind of a timeless dreamlike quality to it. I would go as far to say this could be considered a cult classic some day. Maybe in 30 years someone else might appreciate this film only at face value."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie has unfairly gotten a lot of hate, and I honestly can't see why. Well, ok, that's not exactly true. A big part of it is that it came out during a time where Lohan's career was at an all time low and the public pretty much hated her. That hatred was projected onto this movie, and so people began to hate it by default. I even know people who claimed they \"hated\" it when they hadn't even seen it. You can't make that claim without watching it first.\n\nThe movie has a pretty interesting premise. It's a murder mystery involving twin stigmata. From what I've heard, however, most people were expecting some kind of twist at the end where it's revealed that the twins are actually the same person. When the movie didn't go that route, people were upset. That seems to be another reason why people primarily hated the movie. Personally, I think it was smart not to do that. Twin stigmata in movies is not something we've seen that often, but movies with a plot twist like that have been something we've seen a thousand times. The fact that so many people thought that's what would happen proves that. So people were upset that they didn't have some grand twist. Instead, the movie gave you exactly what it promised and was exactly what it was made out to be. Simple, but still good.\n\nOverall, I say to give the movie a chance. Ignore the hate you've heard about it and go in expecting it to be what it is, a simple murder mystery involving twin stigmata. Is it a masterpiece? No, of course not, but it's still a pretty good movie that will keep you entertained for an hour 45, and that's perfectly ok."

IKWKM is well worth a watch for these reasons alone. The story-line moves along at a steady pace and can seem rather confusing but perseverance will pay off.

The only down to it is that there were some plot holes and I think the ending was a bit abrupt, to me it would have been possible to stretch a little after the final scene."

And, it's too bad, because it could have been better and Lindsay Lohan was really quite good in it. It just seemed like a movie suffering from an identity crisis - trying to be film noir, psychological thriller and gross-out horror flick. It was just way overdone and there were too many holes in the plot. The use of the blue rose petals was so heavy-handed. And, if all that weren't enough, I figured out who the killer was almost from the first moment the character is introduced. Poor Lindsay. All in all, she's not having a very good week. Better luck next time -- if there is one for Lindsay."

        "review_detailed_main": "In New Salem, the upper-class high-school student and aspiring writer Aubrey Fleming (Lindsay Lohan) has just quit the piano classes to dedicate to write. When the mutilated body of her missing schoolmate Jennifer Toland is found, the locals grieve the student while the police chase the serial-killer. After a football game, Aubrey is kidnapped and then she is mutilated by the psychopath. A couple of weeks later, Aubrey is found unconscious in a lonely road and brought to the hospital with severed hand and foot in the same modus-operandi Jennifer was mutilated. When she awakes, she tells that she is the stripper Dakota Moss and her junky mother had an overdose and died. When the FBI finds that Dakota is one character of Aubrey's stories, they conclude the girl needs psychiatric treatment and protection. But Dakota insists she is not Aubrey\u0085\n\n\"I Know Who Killed Me\" has a promising premise of a girl that denies being herself after a traumatic and extremely violent experience. The cinematography is stylish, with blue color for Aubrey and red for Dakota. However, the identity of the killer is easily predictable when Dakota visits Jennifer's parents. Unfortunately, the resolution is absurd and even ridiculous, imaging that what physically happens to Aubrey happens also to Dakota. The secret of Aubrey and Dakota is excellent, but unfortunately wasted in a bad screenplay. Further, most of the characters (FBI agents, Aubrey's boyfriend, the gardener) vanish near the weak conclusion. With improvements in the screenplay, this movie could be great. Nevertheless, the top nomination (9) to the 28th RAZZIE\u00ae Awards is unfair. My vote is five.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Eu Sei Quem me Matou\" (\"I Know Who Killed Me\")"

Although Lindsay Lohan has fully grown into a young good looking woman. This flick was supposed to put Ms Lohan's sexual antics to the top of the box office.\n\nUnfortunately, the script was so bad and the plot was trying to be something out of an Alfred Hitchock movie. If Alfred Hitchcock was to write the script for this movie. There would be no sex scenes or anything in there.\n\nI am surprised about the movie winning the Razzies. It sucked so bad I had to switch halfway through.. I manage to see the rest of the film on my own PC just to find out what happened at the end. But still.. it was crap. I just felt that this movie was a complete waste of time.\n\nIf people want to see a really good sex thriller, try watching those late night movies on cable. You'll feel a lot more better watching that, than watching Ms Lohan's crappy performance.\n\nAnyway, it's a thumbs down for me..! 0 out of 10!"

I can't imagine being involved in this production. The use of repeated imagery never makes any sense (big focus on the color blue, sometimes focus on the color red). Also the number of plot holes is stunning, and the character development is atrocious. LiLo's acting is OK, but pretty much everyone else's is just terrible. It's only 100 minutes long, but it'll feel like hours. If you've ever wanted to experience time dilation, this is the film.\n\nAlso, strangely, the cast in the credits is listed alphabetically by last name. I guess LiLo didn't want top billing--I can't imagine why! Instead, some random woman with 2 lines of dialogue got top billing in this nightmare."

        "review_detailed_main": "but I thought it was a very interesting story.\n\nSHORT REVIEW: Gruesome, gratuitously sexual, interesting story, well acted.\n\nMY BIASES: I rarely watch horror movies. I never, ever watch gruesome horror movies like \"Saw\" and its ilk. I was really in the mood for a horror movie and LL in a more adult role. UPSHOT: I might be marking a little easy. Maybe. Or maybe not.\n\nI felt that the story, characters, and actors were all plenty good enough to entertain me for 2 hours. I suspect that the critics and other people who are dumping on this movie are somewhat reactionary against the fact that it definitely has some gratuitous violence and gratuitous sexuality.\n\nI will not spoil any more than the trailers do. Briefly, the story begins with an artistic girl named Aubrey Fleming. A girl at her school goes missing and her dead body turns up with some amputation. Everyone fears a serial killer, particularly when Aubrey disappears. I girl is brought in to the hospital who looks exactly like Aubrey. Everyone thinks she's Aubrey, but when she wakes up, she claims to be a stripper named Dakota Moss. Here we have a problem. This girl is either Aubrey or Dakota. If she's Aubrey, then why is her delusion that she is Dakota so convincing? If she's Aubrey, then is there really a Dakota? If the girl in the hospital is Dakota, then where the hell is Aubrey, and why do these 2 women look identical? It's a fun set-up and I felt that the end result was satisfying and revealed effectively.\n\nThere were at least 3 scenes that were so gruesome and horrifying that I couldn't watch. I did the old \"cover most of the screen with your hand\" trick.\n\nIn playing a character who has a drug problem and has an identity issue, I couldn't help wondering if LL was trying to exorcise some demons with this movie. Or possibly she was rebelling against her career which has composed of playing many good girls in movies with more general appeal. I have to admit that some of her fans will see this movie just to see her and will really wish they hadn't seen it. If you're expecting \"Mean Girls\" or \"Herbie Fully Loaded\", you will need some therapy to recover from this one.\n\nI should mention that while there is no Lindsay Lohan nudity per se, there are some extremely raunchy scenes involving close shots of various body parts of Dakota's while she is wearing next to nothing and writhing around a stripper dance pole. Just in the interests of full disclosure.\n\nIn a side-note about cinematography, this movie is very blue, in the literal, colour sense. It's fun to watch just how hog-wild they went with all the blue. I started watching for blue objects and there were many: bright blue lights, clothing, ribbons, glass, eyes, gloves, etc. Not to mention that every shot seems to have a blue tint.\n\nSo consider yourself fairly warned and enjoy the twists and turns of this movie, if you choose to give it a shot."

The ending could of been taken a bit further but, nothing you can do about that.\n\nThis movie will probably get bad ratings from almost everybody but me and i guess its because i've learned to appreciate movies for what they are.

I respect that attempts were made to bring visual interest and a sort of intellectualism to the generic torture-porn plot, but these attempts failed spectacularly.\n\nI read the reviews and I knew that it would be bad, but I was thinking that it might be bad in a funny way, sort of campy. Unfortunately, that was a bad assumption. I could only get through the first hour of the movie before deciding that my time would be better spent doing... just about anything else. Every attempt at symbolism is clunky, the dialogue is hackneyed, the pacing is jolting, and the plot is at once overly-complicated and lacking in essential details.\n\nThe problem here, I think, is that everyone involved in this film seems to have really believed in it, they believed that they were creating a worthwhile product. The result of that attitude paired with a horrible script is pretentious film-making at its worst.\n\nI've got to say, though, that the most disturbing aspect of the film was not the super-gory torture scenes, but instead the idea behind having a sexed-up teenager writhing around in ambiguous moaning pain/pleasure while being tortured by an anonymous man. The seemingly unintended sub-textual implication that a young woman in pain is a sexy, alluring object was the only frightening thing about this horrible, horrible waste of money."

        "review_detailed_main": "After seeing I Know Who Killed Me yesterday, surrounded by a New York/East Village crowd, I am getting pretty annoyed by the sadly anticipated reviews claiming to whoever might want to hear it that this movie is as much of a joke as Lindsay Lohan's latest \"career\" moves.\n\nBeing familiar with miss Lohan's personal struggles much more than I am with her movies, I bought my ticket with a somewhat open-mind, even though after seeing the trailer (maybe the only bad element of the movie), I admit that I was basically expecting a teenage slasher movie. Obviously, so did the critics but they won't have the decency to review the movie for what it actually turned out to be.\n\nFrom the little promotion we got, we basically were told that this would be Lohan's first \"adult\" role as a leading lady. I guess the people waiting for a 20yo to play an \"adult\" are indeed going to be disappointed, but let's leave those thinking about the absurdity of their expectations. Lindsay Lohan actually offers \"adults\" viewers a respectable leading performance. Because here what the movie is: a campy, slightly trashy, cult comedy for young adults familiar with the cheap horror flicks from the 80's and critical of the American values of suburban loss.\n\nI read about how terrible the movie is because some genius knew who the killer was from the start. I read that the chills are laughable... Reviewers, guess what. You're not cleverer than the writers and director. However you might be one more prototype that movie studios rely on to produce pleasing blockbuster hits.\n\nI know Who Killed Me could be classified in the same category as movies like Grindhouse or TV's Twin Peaks. It has a permanent subtle humor about itself and what it depicts. Bored teenagers, immature parents, unqualified teachers and overpowered police... here is the bunch of characters you will get to know. The casting was well directed and miss Lohan does suck you in the movie with her well known attitude and an unsuspected self-cynical humor. She's a teen actress playing a stripper, she knows it sounds bad and it makes the movie good.\n\nThe ending might be open to interpretation, like most interesting endings always are (Mulholland Drive, Basic Instinct, etc.) but who killed the poor girls won't matter much by the end of this movie. The psychological journey of Lohan's character is the central piece of the movie, and the foundations to it are its own comical elements.\n\nOf course, I referred to Lynch, Tarantino and Verhoeven (who interestingly enough suffered the same kind treatment after the camp classic Showgirls) but I would not go as far as saying that I Know Who Killed me has the same rare genius that will make it last through the years, but it absolutely delivered the cynical fun that comes out from somewhere in between utter stupidity and sharp wit.\n\nMy little East Village crowd surprisingly was open-minded enough to clap the movie throughout the end credits. Of course I pleasantly joined the applause. I pretty much anticipate the movie to join the lot of \"love them or hate them\" flicks, so, just like the movie did, I will not take myself too seriously and just claim that: \"I looooved it!\""

This is a pathetic attempt at an art film, and what is perhaps even more pathetic than the film's overall effect, is that Lindsay Lohan actually thought she'd win an Oscar for this film. The dialogue is insultingly bad. And what I mean by \"insultingly bad\" is that you, as an audience member, should feel offended that filmmakers and screenwriters (like the ones who poured 4 months of their lives into this movie), actually think you are too stupid to understand anything, without being expressly told what to think and feel; or that an art film, by definition should have nothing open to interpretation. The movie looked like it was shot with my home video camera, the characters are one dimensional, and the acting is laughable. I Know Who Killed Me, seemed to be perfectly content, resting its alleged DEPTH upon the standard Independent Film standby elements: Trippy & confusing film sequences, violence, sex, and apparently; a new addition: AMPUTEES!! Save your brain cells for a night of drinking, which will be invariably more entertaining than this piece of garbage."

Now, I may have had a few issues with Lindsay Lohan and her much-publicized antics, but keep in mind I have no bias against her as an actress. I do, however, now have a strong bias against the director, Chris Sivertson, and the writer, Jeff Hammond.\n\nFirst off, the movie's a pretentious piece of crap. The director tries for artistic symbolism, most notably with all the reds and blues, and fails miserably. My favorite color happens to be blue, but after seeing this train wreck, I don't think I ever want to see another blue thing again.\n\nThe script is lame-brained to begin with, and hearing some of these actors, especially Lohan, deliver these lines is just an indescribably awful experience.\n\nAnd then there were all the shots of gore and blood I found completely unnecessary (A word of advice: If you do want to see this, don't eat anything beforehand), not to mention the ridiculous twist near the end. (The deleted ending offers another twist that's just as bad, if not worse, as it makes the audience feel even more cheated) So, overall, this movie sucks, and I would only recommend seeing it if you happen to be a connoisseur of bad cinema, as it does have its fair share of laughable moments as well as boring or disgusting ones. In fact, that unintentional humor is the only thing keeping me from rating this a 1/10."

This is weird, cause I have to admit - she is not exactly one of ma favorites, but she is usually not SO BAD. Also I have no idea why someone like Julia Ormond would play in this crap.

I like the basic idea of the movie, but the presentation of it was just horrible. The plot was not easily followable nor interesting. The acting was not horrible, actually it was believable by some standards. I had thought that the caliber of actors would prove to make a great movie. However, I was sadly disappointed. I am just glad that I did not spend very much money other than renting the flic. I am also happy that I watched this movie as number two of the six I had rented for the weekend, so this makes any other movie I watch seem like an Oscar winning movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'll start off by saying that I love this movie. I'm sure there will be a huge critical backlash against it, which is too bad, because it is the sort of movie that is very rare these days. I Know Who Killed me is a cult/camp classic in the making, and will hopefully be recognized as such. I saw this movie last night in San Francisco. Everyone in the audience seemed to be having a good time, but when we were leaving the theater I overheard lots of people saying things like \"I was laughing the whole time. It was so bad!\" Honestly, I'm pretty baffled as to what these people expect when they go see a movie like this and have that reaction. From all the publicity I saw for this movie, I can't see how anyone could justify thinking that it was going to be some sort of high art psychological thriller in the vein of the Shining, or Vertigo. I was sort of afraid that it would be another one of those mediocre thrillers that take themselves too seriously (Murder By Numbers, Premonition), but instead I was delighted. The movie has a real sense of humor about itself and does not disappoint when it comes to absurd twists and turns and moments of glorious camp. Fans of Grindhouse,Evil Dead, and of Rob Zombie's movies will probably be won over by this movie. Miss Lohan should be proud of herself for her work in this. Despite her recent legal troubles, her role in this film gives me hope that she could have a fruitful career ahead of her if she plays her cards right. The first part of the movie, in which Miss Lohan plays over achiever Aubrey Fleming, is probably the weakest section. It has some entertaining parts (like the strip tease from the creepy gardener character), but overall, it is hard to think of Lindsay Lohan as a straight A student from small town America. However, the movie, as well as Miss Lohan's performance takes a strong turn for the best when she transforms into Dakota Moss, the sassy stripper with a troubled past. Even though the days of Mean Girls have long past, we are reminded that Miss Lohan has great comedic timing, and a strong screen presence. The character of Dakota has a very appealing bluntness, and Miss Lohan is perfect at portraying this. She and Rose McGowan are certainly in close competition for the title of Cult Cinema's Queen, but unlike Ms McGowan Ms Lohan is truly a talented actress. I hope to see her in more movies like this. Although I don't want to spoil the ending, I will say that the final scenes, after we know who the killer is, are downright hilarious. Also, this movie has one of the best final shots I've seen in a long time. If you're a fan of camp, ridiculous gore, general absurdity, and sick of generic Hollywood thrillers with no sense of humor, then I know Who Killed me will be a real treat for you."

        "review_detailed_main": "I still cannot believe, months later, that I was forced to watch \"I Know Who Killed Me\", aka the worst film of the year (tied with \"The Heartbreak Kid\").\n\nTruly, I cannot fathom as to why people are so eager to call Lindsay Lohan a \"great\" actress - the girl cannot even pass for mediocre, at least not here. She gives the most unconvincing, wooden performance I've seen this year, and in her career, and does nothing to make the best of a really dismal script.\n\nAnd lets be honest here: the script really is rotten, from beginning to end. The supposed \"real\" ending is even more moronic than the gruesome scenes including Dakota, which are unrealistic and laughable. LAUGHABLE is the perfect word to sum up this film; everything from the editing, the dialogue, the premise, and the acting from the overall cast (save Julia Ormond, who manages to take her scant lines and create a glimpse of character that could actually be worth caring about, if the rest of the film weren't so contrived).\n\nI cannot imagine a bigger waste of anyone's time when it comes to watching films. Its difficult for me to give such a strong negative reaction to any movie; as an avid film lover I quite frequently try to find the good in any \"bad\" or unsuccessful film. \"I Know Who Killed Me\" has no redeeming qualities at all. I think even teenage boys desperate for a peek at Miss Lohan's assets (read: her only real talents) will be disappointed to find her stripping and sex scenes simply more excuses to laugh and cringe, rather than anything else. Men and women alike with any taste or idea of what a solid film should like look with greatly dislike \"I Know Who Killed Me.\" Please, don't listen to the rabid Lohan fans who insist IKWKM is artistic or even watchable - its not even worth the few laughs you'll get from watching a film that's so bad, its funny."

Her body is found several weeks later after she had been brutally tortured and cutup by her abductor. A few days later, Aubrey Fleming (Lindsay Lohan) disappears after a college football game, and becomes his next victim. The FBI believe that they are looking for a sadistic serial killer who likes to viciously play with his victims before getting rid of them. The FBI hope they can find Aubrey before she is killed. About a week later, a critically injured girl is found by the roadside and taken to the hospital. Aubrey's parents Daniel (Neal McDonough) and Susan (Julia Ormond) are at her bedside when she awakens. The girl tells Aubrey's parents that she doesn't know Aubrey, and that she is a stripper named Dakota Moss. The doctors believe Aubrey is suffering from traumatic stress of the ordeal and she only needs a little time to recover her memory. Dakota begins to believe that she may be Aubrey's identical twin. The only problem with that is that she was an only child.\n\n(My Comment) I know who killed Lindsay Lohan's career. If this movie doesn't do it and of course her drinking, I don't know what will. The movie was supposed to be a suspenseful thriller, but for the most part, it moves at a slow pace. I think Lindsay wanted to make a movie where she could be a bad girl and break the good girl mold. The big problem with that is that Lindsay was not very good as a bad girl stripper in the movie. Maybe a teenage audience might not be as critical with her dancing and acting. The story had some twists and turns that should have made it a good movie, but for some reason, Lindsay's part did not connect with the audience. The one thing I could not watch was the scenes where the serial kill started cutting off body parts. The ending was just a little unbelievable. Didn't anyone have a cell phone to call the police?

I would have to say that the script is what had me cringing most of the way through the film. The plot is pretty creative and the directing is interesting at times. It's just the god awful script that's a serious drawback. Also, the director needs to grow up a little because a solid 15 minutes of this movie is focused on Lohan's half-naked body.\n\nIn a nutshell, if it had a better script and less time wasted on Lohan dancing, I think this movie could have been a hell of a lot better."

The worse part about this movie was the part where the director got lazy with the special effects,(that or he spent all of the movie budget on blow and prostitutes,) and instead of making cool looking star wars like effects, he was cheap. My example was Lindsey's cut off hand, instead of making it look cool, like a hook or some sort of incendiary device, they put a glove over her hand and made it look like a prosthetic. Also she has a robot leg, but it was just her real leg with some Christmas lights tapped on it. Anyways the ending was gay and i wasn't turned on at all when Lindsey was almost naked. Freckles are gross! And I hate gingers!"

The script is even more horrible.\n\nIt is just an excuse to A.) See Lindsay gratuitously dance as a stripper B.) Have Lindsay say the F word C.) Gore, Gore, and More gore!!

Lindsay is a phenomenal actress in this flick, which utterly engaged me as a viewer. The plot at times gets heavy-handed; however, it is not a giveaway where the mystery is going. Those who get caught up in the sexual undertones seriously need to get out more. Lindsay has revived her expertise in playing duel characters with commitment to the roles. This movie is a much needed and intriguing thriller. Best thriller/horror since \"The Ring.\" It is a \"Must See!\""

        "review_detailed_main": "Modern-day exploitation movie, \"I Know Who Killed Me\" was obviously seen by the wrong audience, which explains the low scores. I would love to have seen the fat, confused faces of mainstream American audiences as they settled into their seats at the mall cineplex to watch... this! Probably expecting to see some family-friendly thriller like \"I Know what You Did Last Summer,\" and instead being faced with some rather heavy stuff indeed. Here we have a film that is not afraid to be non-commercial and offensive; in fact it looks like it is going out of it's way to be so. The madness begins when Aubrey Fleming (Lindsay Lohan) wakes up in a hospital bed, minus one foot and one hand. She has apparently lost her mind as well, claiming to be another person altogether; one Dakota Moss, a foul-mouthed, pill popping stripper who was raised on the wrong side of the tracks. The story bends and weaves nicely, and it keeps the viewer guessing, while treating us to some bizarre and often disturbing imagery. A sadistic serial killer has been kidnapping young women and torturing them, by freezing/burning their limbs with chunks of dry ice, before removing them! He is also pumping them full of speed so they will be painfully aware of their own situation. Heavy stuff for the mall cineplex; what were they thinking, showing this alongside commercial fodder like Toy Story 2? The film is quite good, it is different and never boring. There are nice artistic/creative touches throughout, and much obscure symbolism besides. Lohan took the step away from teen roles and Disney, and really went to the other side with a film that is as jaded as it is controversial. And without giving away the ending, I will say how relieved i was that the filmmakers did not go the familiar route of making the whole thing a dream. For those with a strong stomach and appreciation for exploitation cinema, i would recommend it. I call it 'exploitation' because of the numerous and unnecessary striptease dance routines performed by lohan, as the camera lingers on open legs and panty shots, as well as some truly nasty and sadistic gore. But like much of the exploit genre, there is a wild story and some strong ideas to hold the attention beyond the cheap thrills. Now that this has found it's way to video release it might find it's intended audience, and might even gain cult status. for fans of Tom Cruise and Jennifer Anniston films, i advise you to stay away."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"I Know Who Killed Me,\" is it a title, or is the movie trying to tell us something? Now I have been reading a lot of reviews that claim that people are slamming this movie because of Lindsey Lohan's recent escapades. Ed Wood was a messed up guy, but that didn't make his films good. This movie deserves to be slammed by the critics, slammed by the box office, and the DVD's should be thrown away. I say this because this is the worst type of bad movie. It is a movie made for the sole reason of making itself seem smart, and it isn't. The acting was sub-par, the plot was garbled and messy at best, and then cinematography, while made pretty by red and blue flashes was destroyed by the fact that scenes were chopped up into tiny pieces and thrown together in a way that seemed almost random. There are some movies that are funny because of how bad they are, but this movie was just painful to watch, especially in the bloody parts where it imitate a slasher (which it did in an almost laughable fashion). When the movie started I knew it was going to try to seem smarter than it was, by the middle I had a headache from the bad acting and ridiculous story line, and the stupid, out of the blue ending couldn't come soon enough. I hated every minute of this movie which, if I were an idiot killer with no back-story and a fetish with blue glass knives (I didn't know piano teachers also blew glass) I would torture my victims by making them watch it."

The movie was way too dark, which is a way to save money on sets. The plot needs a lot of help it is illogical. How stupid is it that Dakota Moss's fingers and leg falls off because her twin sister's fingers and leg are cut off. The writers must have been on drugs while writing the script.

And for those peoeple who didn't like this because of sex/torture parts you really need to get over it. I've seen much worse in movies. Try watching a Troma film. If you dare.. Troma makes the sickest and demented horror movies EVER. But they are also very cheesy and low budget. I would probably give some Troma movies a 3 or 4 star rating but not this movie. I think the people that didn't like this movie, just, well they didn't like it because it has Lindsay Lohan. 7 out of 10!"

Lindsey Lohan has a twin and these twins can feel each other's pain so much to the point that when one loses an arm the other loses an arm. I have no idea because instead of making it something supernatural the film feels the necessary to pass this off as a real thing. So she wakes up in a hospital one day with no arm and is taken in by people who claim to be her parents but are really the twins parents and the daughter is in the clutches of a killer and she starts banging the twins boyfriend for some reason if any movie could prove to you Lindsey Lohan can't act worth a damn this is that movie. There are no scares in this film, the only thing I could give this film is that I really didn't see where they were going with it because every turn was so damn stupid and nonsensical that I stopped caring twenty minutes in."

The music was also great and very Angelo Badalamenti-ish.\n\nSome reviews categorized it as part of the Torture Porn sub-genre, but I disagree, I think the gore wasn't too gratuitous. Whenever there was gore it was effective, it wasn't overused to the point where the audience becomes apathetic to it.\n\nI especially liked the art direction, and overall I think it was very aesthetically pleasing. Some interesting surreal imagery. Yes, the color symbolism was overdone, but what can I do, all those lush blues and reds appealed to me.\n\nI also thought the script was clever in its \"plants\" & \"pay-offs\" and in terms of foreshadowing. And Lindsay Lohan's acting, though not brilliant, was adequate and convincing.\n\nThe directing in some of the dramatic dialogue scenes could have been tighter, with a bigger sense of urgency, especially towards the end, but I will be interested to see what director Chris Sivertson does next.\n\n7.5 out of 10"

I like Neal McDonough, I think he is a good actor. Lindsay Lohan, on the other hand is the female version of Keanu Reeves, not much acting range. I think she was at her best when she was doing Disney films before she was a teenager. If I am going to be subjected to Lindsay Lohan movie, I would rather it be Parent Trap. Outside of that one, there is not much else that she really did all that well in. Getting back to this one, if you are going to pay to see it, wait until it hits a dollar theater.

I could have picked this one up but downloaded it because I had travel plans and wanted something on my MP4 player.\n\nIt was $1 well saved.\n\nI read some of the reviews here, one of which was written by someone who thought this was an ironic side swipe at the slasher/gore genre.\n\nSorry, but it wasn't. It's pretty clear that this movie was made in all seriousness and is intended to be a gory thriller with a twist ending. I will happily concede that the twist was interesting enough and not one I suspected.\n\nBut the rest of the movie is just not good. Lohan does a better job as Dakota than she does as Aubrey, but she doesn't have much to work with in terms of character or script. As most others here have said, the killer's identity is clear almost from the get go. The blue motif is insanely heavy handed. Julia Ormond and Where Have I Seen Him Before are both accomplished actors with good reputations and I really don't know what they are doing here. Maybe the producers spent the writers budget getting these actors on board.\n\nBut in all fairness, this really isn't the worst movie ever made. It is pretty bad, and a little disgusting in parts, poorly scripted, lacking direction and only adequately acted. I think it might appeal to someone around 14 or 15 who wants to be grossed out and maybe a little scared, but to be honest, I think that 14 and 15 year olds are more discerning.\n\nAnyway, my advice would be to leave this one alone. It fails to deliver on so many levels."

I only got this movie because I love Lindsey Lohan You see I just love The Parent Trap and all the Disney movies she was in. SO therefore I pick this up and put it in. Well I gave it a 1.5 because it was just too blue! I mean their are other wonderful colors green, red, orange, pink, purple, and so on! I mean when I was watching it I had to go put on every color I had besides blue, because I needed more colors! I even thought about going to Office Depot because I just the urge to paint my house every color I could. And this movie was inappropriate! But yeah this movie \"I Know Who Killed Me\", which I thought would be full of every color, was just too blue for me. Maybe in the next movie they'll have more colors!"

Lindsey Lohan stars as two personalities, Aubrey and Dakota. It starts off as Aubrey who is abducted and tortured. She loses some limbs and she recovers as Dakota. Lohan did a decent job but wasn't anything special like some of her huge supporters think she was. The script was terrible and same to the writing. In fact, it was so bad that it may of been intentional.\n\nThere were a few things that I did like in the film. It was advertised as a horror but turned out to be a psychological mystery instead. I actually like the cinematography of the film and same to the score. There were some cool shots as most other people would disagree. I just didn't really get it and after reading the message boards, there seems to be many possibilities on how the movie was suppose to end. No matter what, pieces don't fit for all the possibilities. Also, I noticed people were mentioning the large amounts of blood and gore in the film. I disagree. If you compare this movie with Saw III, Saw IV, Captivity, and Hostel, the gore was not nearly as ridiculous as those I mentioned.\n\nAll in all, you might want to skip this movie. It so badly done that it is amazing it even got its wide release and not direct to video. I can't give it a one because I still found decent qualities in the movie. My Verdict (3/10 or a D)."

        "review_detailed_main": "A highly entertaining and dreamlike little thriller, I KNOW WHO KILLED ME is essentially a modern-day film noir about a horrific crime and a victim (Lindsay Lohan) who turns out to be someone very different than we think she is. There are horror film elements in the movie -- a hidden serial killer with a fetish for glass knives and amputations; a spectacular climax straight out of a Dario Argento movie -- but this is basically NOT a horror film, and that may confuse and/or disappoint a number of viewers who expect one from the title and advertising which bring to mind something like I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER etc. Lohan, in a nifty dual role, gives a very credible performance throughout, and I encourage anyone who sees the film to put pre-conceptions aside and try to look at the movie, and her work in it, with fresh eyes. This is also a very female-centered story, one that hinges on the interior world of its young protagonist -- that in itself makes the movie a unique piece of work. The real discovery here, though, is director Chris Sivertson who more than delivers on the promise of his earlier film, the incredibly disturbing drama THE LOST (see it when it comes out later this year.) I KNOW WHO KILLED ME is much more of a mainstream, commercial movie than THE LOST, but that's not a bad thing -- this is a genre film, pure and simple, and within the rules of that terrain, Sivertson & Co. deliver a strange and hypnotic little mystery that confounds expectations at every turn. Highly recommended for both the movie and for Sivertson's work as director."

BUT not fight club/ memento, more like 'laugh out out, that was f''kin some sloppy sh't right there!' the plot is very convoluted, and has been knocked up real quick. there are visions of what the serial killer is like who talks non sensical BS that's somehow meant to be a clue or something to the overall plot??

        "review_title": "pretentious twister of a horror-thriller, it won't kill Lohan's career, but it's a definite blotch",
        "review_detailed_main": "I Know Who Killed Me, written and directed by two first-timers respectively (the director has done a couple of ultra low-budget horror efforts, seen only in festivals), is the end result of the two of them (and the producers more or less) watching much too much of the series Twin Peaks and the film Fire Walk With Me without really understanding the symbolism exactly. It's a mystery of a mystery, and it involves stigmatic twins, owls, severed limbs, and severed finger, and a killer who may have escaped from the Blue Man Group and was forced into appearing in this film. Lindsay Lohan, attempting to dig deeper than ever with her acting talents (and for all of her debauchery and self-destruction off-camera she does in fact have a little talent, seen most prominently in Prarie Home Companion), portrays Aubrey/Dakota as a woman/women torn by fragmented memories and a life that's as pulpy as a rotten orange. To go into the plot too much might not exactly be spoiling but merely too disengaging: Aubrey, the girl who's the 'normal' one, goes to school, is smart, has the cute boyfriend, disappears one night, is gone for three weeks and is discovered on the side of the road missing a leg and a hand. In the hospital she also says she is not Aubrey but Dakota, a stripper who's mother was a crack-head and has no social security number.\n\nThe twists that perpetuate go on until the very end, which soon becomes less confusing and just plain stupid. The condition that Aubrey/Dakota has is explained thanks to an Ask.com entry with a weird man explaining it behind a space-like background. Meanwhile, the director goes to town in illuminating the harsh and would-be surreal psychological states with the color blue. It's a motif that not only falls flat on itself, but becomes part of the unintentional humor abundant in the film. The action veers towards Evil Dead parody, with one shot reminiscent of the classic line \"Groovy\", and there's even one sequence that looks ripped right off of the dream scene in Vertigo, right down to the music. Like The Number 23, the filmmakers attempt at subject matter meaning to be provocative and dramatically tense all the way, but the concepts don't fly by because of a lack of solid skills; with the millions of dollars at the disposal of the crew, why should there be scenes where shots are out of focus and without any significant stylistic effect. How do we care about someone being tortured if it veers into looking like a short film shot by an over-ambitious teenager with a camcorder and a penchant for Tony Scott?\n\nAs for Lohan, who goes into her role as if it's both The Parent Trap ten years after and a revisionist take on Laura Palmer, it's not exactly a horrible performance in corresponding with not exactly a failure of a film. The problem is that any skills that she puts into the scenes are faltered on the material, and on her lack of experience thus far in tackling more complex subject matter and a character who- had it been under a possibly more competent filmmaker- could be demanding of an emotional upheaval. The scenes where she strips (and a stripper who, as did Jessica Alba in Sin City and Natalie Portman in Closer, is more of a go-go dancer as opposed to a classic striptease artist) are muddled and sluggish, if looking objectively, and it just adds to the exploitive aura of the whole picture. In fact, it probably serves best, particularly if one is going into it looking for unintentional humor (if you're a Twin Peaks fan as well it's likely to pop up every other scene at least), as a low-end exploitation flick that doesn't serve much purpose on anyone who worked on it in the future. Maybe they'll go on to better things, but for now it's sub-par."

I honestly wouldn't even recommend renting it for 1$, you might as well ask another poor soul that wasted 1 hr and 42 min watching this movie, about the ending. I can understand why people were laughing, sadly i couldn't join them because i was too busy thinking, \"what on earth is going on?\" I've seen a few of these actors on screen before and they weren't that bad, but this movie just made them look like they didn't know how to act.

        "review_detailed_main": "To be honest, I wanted to watch this mainly because of its dominance of this year\u2019s Razzie awards \u2013 though learning it was a horror film, I guess, increased my interest slightly. All things considered, while it\u2019s certainly pretty bad, I\u2019d say that any of the crass teen comedies which turn up every year would be even more deserving of such dubious \u2018accolades\u2019! One other thing which caught my fancy was the fact that the narrative involved twins \u2013 since, as some of you might know, I am one myself; several movies have been made over the years on the subject, usually psychological thrillers \u2013 this follows in that trend but, at least, provides a new angle with its Stigmata association (though I didn\u2019t buy it myself).\n\nI\u2019d only ever seen teen idol Lindsay Lohan in Robert Altman\u2019s melancholy and elegiac swan-song A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION (2006) where, surprisingly, she managed to hold her own in some mighty fine company. On the other hand, Lohan doesn\u2019t quite cut it here as a dramatic actress \u2013 but, if anything, provides reasonable titillation with her steamy stripper act and one sex scene! The film tries to be hip by playing on the unsavory element which, lamentably, seems to have overtaken the horror genre of late and which has been tastlessly dubbed as \u201ctorture porn\u201d. Thus, it presents several totally pointless but unflinching instances of violence \u2013 morbidly lingering on the gory details in what can only be described as a perversion of what constitutes mass entertainment!\n\nAs I said, it never convinces for a second \u2013 with the revelation as to the villain\u2019s identity being particularly blah; nor does it arouse much sympathy for her heroine(s), or anyone else involved: the police are typically annoying, while Julia Ormand\u2019s role as the mother of the two Lohans is rather superficial. In the end, the overall consensus about the film seems to be that of being a misguided attempt at a mature breakthrough for its talented but troubled star."

How could she be the same person? How could she not be Aubrey? When the secret is revealed, it should come as a surprise. It did for me.\n\nThis film was enjoyable, and if Lohan ever decides to play a role for real, then she may gain some credibility."

        "review_detailed_main": "I went into \"I Know Who Killed Me\" with rock-bottom expectations. It was MUCH worse than I expected it to be. The script was messy, it had a bunch of unbelievable plot twists that made no sense, and the acting was awful. Lindsay Lohan sucked, as expected. But as I watched this, I saw her career crumble, and that was nice to see. But you get to see Lohan get tortured, so that makes this relatively worth seeing. The direction was the only thing I enjoyed about this movie, because the feel was very independent, but artsy. And that's the only reason why I didn't give this crapfest a 1/10 rating. In the beginning of \"I Know Who Killed Me\", Lohan's first character, Aubrey is a high school student, reading a story to her classmates about her supposed alter ego, Dakota Moss. And then Aubrey gets murdered, we assume, and she comes back as Dakota. If you're not already confused by this terrible plot, you're a better person than I am. This movie isn't only badly acted, and poorly written, but it doesn't make sense. There are many better movies out there that are actually worth your time. This one isn't."

        "review_detailed_main": "It was supposed that this movie was of horror?? Well,It was ridiculous. The movie has not logical at all. Lindsay's performance was really disappointing, i thought it would be bad, but not that bad.\n\nIn first place the plot of the movie is dull, twins simply aren't that connected. In second place, the movie has a lot of ridiculous situations, like the one when Dakota's finger falls down and she, instead of going to the hospital, she sew it to her hand again, Who in the world would do that!!!! Other ridiculous situation is when she discovers who is the killer, and she goes after him instead of telling police, does that look logical? The movie is very boring, and for those who think that maybe it deserves to be seen because of Lindsay's striper dances, I'm sorry but it doesn't.\n\nConcluding, this movie is one of the worst I've ever seen, I recommend not to buy the DVD, and if you want to watch it, watch it on you tube, at least there it's free."

Put in some bad English dubbing and slap Argento's name on it, and people would be hailing it as a giallo masterpiece! Now, I'm not suggesting this is some misunderstood classic, but giallos are not exactly known for their sensible plots and great acting. The bright primary colors (those oh-so subtle reds and blues) are also giallo staples. This would've made for a great drive- in double feature with The Bird With The Crystal Plumage back in those fondly remembered days. And I believe that Lindsay Lohan is due for a career renaissance as the new queen of the b-movies, with this as a prime example. If you long for the grindhouse era, then this is right up your aisle."

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw this in a very quiet theater, I'm serious, about twelve people. Probably die-hard Lindsay fans like me. I ended up liking this movie. Lindsay Lohan plays Aubrey a sweet young girl who gets kidnapped by a limb-cutting psycho. She actually remembers to act here, seriously, in most of the film Lindsay creates two memorable and different characters. Granted, there are a couple moments where she looks like she's waiting for a line to be read, but for the most part she did well. For those who care, Lindsay does show some skin here, and if you have any imagination you'll be seeing all of lovely Lindsay there is.\n\nThis is a very dark, read gory, twisty thriller that actually does leave you guessing till the final frame. Honeslty, I'm not normally fooled by this stuff, but this one was interesting. The essential twist is rather hard to swallow, but still. The Director did a good job with color and little habits that if you pay attention, reveal the plot. I won't spoil it for you, cept to say they leave just enough unexplained to be interesting, but not unsatisfying.\n\nOf the supporting cast only Julia Ormond stands out as Aubrey's mom. She has really improved as an actress. Remember how stiff she was in \"Legends of the Fall\"? She nearly killed a great picture there. Here she's much better, particularly in the scene where Aubrey takes her boyfriend up to her room. Mom lets it happen, hoping it will trigger her daughter's memory. Julia does a nice job trying to show a Mom not wanting to hear her child in the throws of passion, yet hoping to hear a mental breakthrough. Cool scene for Lindsay fans too.\n\nI'm not saying this was great but for comparison shoppers this was ten times better than \"In the Cut\" with a puffy-lipped Meg Ryan. That was nasty with no reason. This had reasons, and if they were hard to believe, is life any stranger?\n\nI admit Lindsay probably did this just to show, \"See I'm not a child-star anymore! I can say the f-word and everything!\" but the movie was good. I recommend this for horror/mystery fans and anyone with a crush on the Lindsay. Heck, I'd watch it again just to look for goof in the complex plot!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw this movie last year with three friends on the Saturday night of it's opening weekend. Every weekend we go to a movie and that weekend we picked \"I Know Who Killed Me\" because a fourth friend, who's a big Simpsons fan, couldn't make it so we decided we'd wait a week to see that movie so we can see it with him. The theater's filling for \"I Know Who Killed Me\" was moderate probably because Lohan didn't actually promote it (meaning on talk shows, she was rather in the news because of the then recent meltdown) and because it was a R-rated Horror movie with a big blockbuster film opening on the same day (\"The Simpsons Movie\").\n\nThat said, I don't think that this movie was that bad. I'm certainly not a \"fan\" of this movie nor would I purchase it, however it certainly wouldn't have been nominated for all those Razzies if it wasn't for Lohan's disastrous period of time right before the film's opening (certainly they only gave two Razzies for one category {\"Worst Actress\"} because off Lohan's meltdown, \"Worst Excuse for a Horror Movie\" wasn't even a category last year, and a screen couple with herself is ridiculous). Personally, I think the worst movie of 2007 was \"Norbit\", closely followed by \"Captivity\" and \"The Number 23\", then \"Epic Movie.\"\n\n\"I Know Who Killed Me\" is about a young woman named Aubrey Fleming (played by Lindsay Lohan), a talented pianist and aspiring writer, disappears without a trace. Then one night, a driver discovers a young woman by the side of the road, disheveled and critically injured. The girl is rushed to the hospital where Aubrey's parents, Susan (played by Julia Ormond) and Daniel (played by Neal McDonough), wait by her side. When Aubrey is finally able to speak, she shocks everyone by claiming to be a stripper named Dakota Moss. Terrified and confused, she starts seeing visions of a figure slowly butchering his captive which later leads to a frantic hunt for the menace.\n\n\"I Know Who Killed Me\" was extremely weird, yes, and the acting was mediocre. There were some scary scenes and intense images. The plot wasn't amazing, but certainly more than \"torture porn\" \u0096 and remember, it's a horror movie, you don't expect an incredible plot line when you go see a horror movie. Some say the ending was confusing, and I agree that it was, but I like that out of a thriller/horror film - it makes you think more about the mystery.\n\nA couple people on the board, just like many other movie boards, love to rant and say that this was the worst movie ever, but it definitely was not. The main reason why the movie did they way it did in the box office was because of the big blockbuster ''The Simpsons Movie'' releasing on the same day. In my opinion, to say this movie is the worst ever is really rather foolish because I can't forget these movies:\n\nBatman and Robin (1997) with Clooney, Schwarzenegger, & Thurman ($125 million budget) Battlefield Earth (2000) with Travolta, Whitaker, & Pepper ($75 million budget) The Adventures of Pluto Nash (2002) with Murphy ($100 million budget) Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever (2002) with Liu and Banderas ($70 million budget) Gigli (2003) with Affleck, Lopez, Pacino & Walken ($54 million budget) Twisted (2004) with Judd, Jackson,& Garcia ($50 million budget) Catwoman (2004) with Berry, Stone, Bratt, & Conroy ($100 million budget) Alone in the Dark (2005) with Slater ($20 million budget) Material Girls (2006) with the Duff sisters (unknown budget) Zoom (2006) with Allen & Chase ($35 million budget) Epic Movie (2007) with Coolidge & Hammond ($20 million budget) Captivity (2007) with Cuthbert (unknown budget) Norbit (2007) with Murphy ($65 million budget) The Number 23 (2007) with Carrey & Madsen ($30 million budget) Meet the Spartans (2008) with Electra & Davitian ($30 million budget)\n\nAll of those movies' budgets were larger than \"I Know Who Killed Me\" \u0096 many of them over 6 times as large (IKWKM's budget was only $12 million, by the way) yet I still would rather watch \"I Know Who Killed Me\" over them.\n\nGo and rent this movie if you're curious about it, \"I Know Who Killed Me\" is an above average thriller, that's my opinion anyway."

Well, finally I rented it when it came to DVD 11/27/2007, to be honest I didn't think that it was that bad! It was a little over the top at times, other times jumpy & left me head scratching & saying \"huh?\", but by the end of it I was like \"Wow, it wasn't \"that\" bad\" (trust me there are worst films out there I.E. \"Rob Zombies's Halloween\")! Say what you will about Lindsay Lohan's erratic and admittedly sad recent troubles with the law, but her mature, poignant performance in \"I Know Who Killed Me\" is the latest proof that the girl has talent. I believe in the hands of a more capable director, \"I Know Who Killed Me\" could have been a lot better film. Yes, \"I Know Who Killed Me\" was gory at times, other times a little off and incoherent at times (What was with all the Blue\" color\" through out??), & to me the film had a David Lynch feel to it. But by time the end credits rolled around I said to my partner: \"Yes the story was preposterous even by the standards of the thriller genre, but still the story's developments were unpredictable and certainly intriguing. When the ending comes, & you discover who the killer is, I found myself saying \"I would never have guessed that\"!! Yes the ending leaves you puzzled, but I think that is what the director intentions were. I believe that the director wanted each viewer to draw there own conclusions. Yes there are plot holes, & certain things that need to be tighted within the script, but as a whole the film works! My conclusion: \"I Know Who Killed Me\" wasn't \"THAT\" predictable &/or \"THAT BAD\"!. \"I Know Who Killed Me\" will find an audience, maybe not today, not tomorrow but somewhere. \"I Know Who Killed Me\" will become in years from now a cult film. We both gave the film a C+ (We were mixed between a B- & C+)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Some films have a colour scheme, some films uses colour to make an artistic or symbolic point. I know who killed me is one such movie that at some point might have gotten that memo but something got lost between that memo and the set designers as every...single shot of this movie has blue in it somewhere. I am not joking- honestly as from the very moment this train wreck starts blue is in the shot and it never leaves. The colour is thrown seemingly randomly at anything and everything, there is no symbolism to this blue mess as the only discipline is chaos. I can only see Director Chris Sivertson saying the following \"Paint everything blue! Do entire rooms in the stuff! Everything must be blue!! Blue roses, blue lights, blue rooms, blue clothes? Throw them in! I don't care if it does not make symbolic or artistic cohesion just throw it all in!\" This makes the film look as if it does not trust the viewer to be smart enough to think past the pretty pictures nor does evoke the style of Dario Argento or David Fincher that it wants to copy. Instead it makes the film somewhat ugly to look. It overwhelms the viewer to the point that it irritates them as well as distracting them from the rubbish that is happening on screen.\n\nSpeaking of rubbish, what is the plot of this movie? Well, Aubrey Fleming (played by Lindsay Lohan) is a fantastic student who is great at writing, she is loved by everyone as well as her boyfriend who she does not want to have sex with (this is going to change later in the film in the worst scene of the movie). Then one night she gets kidnapped by some serial killer (We never get a nickname or why he does kill teenage girls.) She is kept there for a few months until being discovered by a driver in a ditch however when at the hospital she claims that she is not Aubrey Fleming but Dakota Moss, a stripper who looks just like Aubrey in every way expect her personality which is more foul mouthed, sex crazed and all around nastiness that Aubrey is not. Now it is up for the police and Aubrey/Dakota to decide if Dakota is really Aubrey and find the killer.\n\nAt first this seems like a needlessly gory rip-off of Silence of the Lambs and Seven but it quickly descends into an awe inspiring, incoherent mess that meddles with twins sharing injuries and seemingly supernatural serial killer stalking that does not work in the slightest way. I found myself going between laughing at the robotic acting and shouting a very loud \"What\" whenever something stupid happened on screen. The killer has no motive to speak of and just kidnaps Aubrey from a crowded street with no witnesses what so ever. Even after the killer is revealed it does not make any sense as we had only one scene with culprit beforehand until the end. The film ends very sudden leaving such questions as 'what happens to the other person, what will the parents say after getting back their daughter? Where did the police vanish to in the final act? Why were the police even there to begin with if they did nothing to further the story?' At the centre of all this is Lindsay Lohan. One must not forget that this was the first movie where she is an adult and it shows, the very first scene is LL as a pole dancing stripper whose moments are so sluggish and obviously choreographed that they are about as sexy as a half-melted chocolate bunny rabbit. She is so desperate to prove that she is an adult that there points in the movie where she gawks at shirtless hunky boys which screams \"I like boys do you get it?! I like boys.\" She has sex with Aubrey's boyfriend while Aubrey's mother in downstairs listening in the most cringe worthy scene in the movie. She swears like an angry sailor because she wants to be seen as a grown-up. She wants to prove to us that she is a woman and no longer a good child actress, now she is a mediocre adult actress that killed her career thanks to this movie.\n\nI now who killed me is a bad, bad, bad film that thinks its smarter then it thinks it is. It is a graveyard for LL's promising career and is one of the most stupid movies I have seen."

A girl who is supposedly supposed to have a twin gets tortured until the twin gets hurt??? The connections made between characters in this film are quite simply non existent. All depth that characters are supposed to have has vanished, because each and every person in the story added no relevance to the film, and no detail or substance to the plot. Which yet again is a reason the movie failed. The final thing is the ending. Like what! How could anyone think this film was good with an ending like that. The resolution is so worthless to the story that it might as well not even be there.\n\nwww.chorror.com"

Is she insane? Is the story merely a metaphor? Was Lindsay Lohan cut out for such a challenging role? All these are questions the film poses. It's a puzzle that once figured out is arguably satisfying.\n\nLohan plays a stripper with bionic limbs and who wouldn't laugh at such a concept. But to mock its lunacy is to miss the point entirely. I Know Who Killed Me, if the title weren't enough of an indication, is entirely tongue-in-cheek. Sivertson even throws in a comical sex scene half way through to drive that point home, though I question that particular decision.\n\nSivertson asks us to accept absurdity and embrace horror and drama equally. Neither as impenetrably dull as an art film or as passively mainstream as a typical Hollywood thriller, his film is both beautiful and brutal, an attempt to unify opposites. This is a film that has multiple levels and pleas for deconstruction.\n\nOverwhelming motifs and unpredictable plot developments are used to derail a conventional whodunit to create a self-conscious independent film which like Revolver (2005), The Fountain (2006) and Southland Tales (2006) defies the expectations of a conventional star vehicle.\n\nPerhaps even the writhing, freckled form of the former child star herself is a comment on society's obsession with youth and celebrity."

I think a bunch of people are just dissing it because they over analyze it too much. it was very entertaining, and Lindsay lohan showed a different side to her acting skills. she's pretty good. although, her recent dui charges are going on right now, I think the movie is still good. I think it flowed good, it was scary and gruesome, and it was probably one of my all time favorite movies. I think the plot was really well written and the acting was superb. although, when I saw it, I saw a advanced screening, and there were a few people laughing at all the gory parts. why was that funny? whatever. I just love I know who killed me and I want to go see it again."

I've never been a fan of Lohan and I'm still not one but I do think she has good movies and can act. This movie proves it.\n\nA few jump scenes, good tension, great acting and beautifully shot, too. For a horror/thriller fan, what's not to like? I didn't see the twist coming, either. It's worth watching and scary in parts. Pretty gory, too, so don't take your kids!\n\nIn the end, I've seen movies far, far worse than this one - and I think this deserves some credit these days because it's one of the only movies that's not a remake, based on a book or comic or a sequel."

The performances are all okay, (Lindsay's is pretty good) and the story is good if you try hard to understand it. The reason I believe people rate it with such low ratings, is because they don't understand it. I personally think that makes it better because if you don't get it, or are confused your going to want to see it again, and again, and again, and when you understand it (which I did the first time actually) it is actually a very original and well made movie. Plus it deserves much more than 4.5 or whatever it has, because in comparison to the Saw Movies it is much better and those have more.\n\nI should probably write down the cons of this movie too, but that wouldn't help because it already has enough so I will skip that part.\n\nOver all I think this film is average, but is worth a look. And once you understand the film you will see what a true gem it really is (at least compared to Saw) 7/10"

I must remind u she is the 1 from the film 'Parent Trap' where she had acted 2 different characters with diff accent & her acting was & is always very natural. She is a gr8 actress. apart from her troubled personal life her acting is always enjoyable. I've seen some of her teen Disney films, good! in this 1 she came out from her usual teen character & showed a more matured approach :) she is the center character of the film & gave a gr8 performance naturally.\n\nnow about the film, its a good mystery thriller that entertained me more than any other recent films in the same category.\n\nDon't hesitate to rent or buy the DVD. watch it if you like this category of films. you won't regret."

She plays high school student Aubrey Fleming who unexpectedly disappears one night. Two weeks later she is found unconscious in the middle of the woods and, when spoken to, she claims that she is somebody else named Dakota Moss. She must then go on to solve the mystery of what happened to this Aubrey person and what connection they have together.\n\nWhile playing Dakota, Lohan demonstrated a character that didn't generate any audience sympathy, for she portrayed a foul-mouthed, stuck-up, unpleasant and confused girl. This makes you want to root against her. While there are some suspense to the film, the plot is confusing in trying to differentiate between the Dakota and Aubrey girls, and the story drags a little toward the end.\n\nGrade D--"

        "review_detailed_main": "Lindsay Lohan has had a tumultuous time in Hollywood. She was a fresh faced young actress that charmed us all in \"The Parent Trap\" and people looked forward to what she would do next. She played the daughter in the remake of \"Freaky Friday\" and wasn't bad in the role. And she was good enough in \"Mean Girls\". But then something happened and like a lot of young stars that have too much money and a lot of stress she took to self medicating with drugs and alcohol. She became a bit of a liability on set. Not showing up for her scenes and often times when she was there she was strung out on something and eventually the offers stopped coming in. And to this period of her life we get 2007's \"I Know Who Killed Me\". A movie so bad it garnered 8 Razzies including \"worst picture\" and \"worst actress\".\n\nMs. Lohan plays two characters in this. One the straight A student and the other a drugged out stripper. Guess which role is more believable? I'll give you a moment to think about it. All I really need to say is this is one movie where art imitates life.\n\nWell surprise surprise they're twins. Twins in which once was given up for adoption and yet they, just now, share a psychic link of sorts. It's never come up before but now when the plot demands it they're suddenly sympatico. But this comes up near the end and only when they're trying to find the \"killer\" as in \"I Know Who Killed Me\". The clue is in the title.\n\nGood Lindsay Lohan one day disappears and they find her two weeks later in a field, with amnesia. But along with this she's like a whole new person. Almost as if it's her long lost twin sister that has suddenly showed up for no reason. I know. It's groundbreaking cinema here. Somebody who was lost shows up later but not remembering who they are and are totally different than the person they once were? That's never been done before in the history of all cinema.\n\nColor plays a huge role in this. The \"good\" version of the character is all about the color blue. From her car to her clothes, everything around her is blue. And the \"bad\" one is all about the color red. And just like with the \"good\" scenes often time this color is emphasized so it's the only color seen on screen or it's shot seemingly through a filter with that color. You think this is maybe going somewhere but it really doesn't until the very end when now the color is purple. You got that right. Once everything is resolved and the two twins have finally met and are in each other's lives, the main color is purple representing their unity. I think. I mean that's the only thing I can really get out of this.\n\nIn the end you're left with a tepid and surprisingly boring mess. There's no tension. The \"killer\" is obvious from the start. And whatever acting talent Ms. Lohan has, it's long gone. This should only be watched for laughs and even then if there's literally nothing else to see."

But when I say this \"thriller\" truly makes no sense, I mean it with the deepest shade of blue. But more on the blue symbolism later. Sivertson's psychological execution had me guessing for hours...just how much Lohan paid the director to do a strip tease. Seriously it's enough to turn any straight man gay. \"Oh, she's suggestively moving that cigarette...ohhh yes, it brushed passed her entrance. Delicious!\". So, a young student is abducted and tortured by a serial killer. She makes it out alive but insists her identity is of another woman, a stripper named Dakota Moss. The story juggles between two theories. She's either delusional and her heightened state of fear caused her to create another identity, or she actually has a twin sister. I shan't spoil it for you, but the end result is predictably underwhelming regardless so you aren't missing out. Amidst the terrible acting, horrific screenplay and mediocre special effects, is a mysterious plot that has more holes than Lohan's cocaine abused nostrils. We are led to believe that the mystical phenomenon of stigmatic twins could be a potential answer to this mystery? To a point where entire limbs are severed in seconds!? Wait! We are led to believe that Aubrey writes an entire fictional novel about Dakota without any prior knowledge of her existence!? Hold up! Her prosthetic leg has the flexibility and manoeuvrability of a real leg!? Hang on! Dakota finds a blue ribbon and just happens to know \"I Know Who Killed Me\" and doesn't call the police!? Blue ribbon, blue roses, blue glass coffin, blue scene transitions, blue filters, blue bedroom, blue gloves. Why. Is. Everything. Blue? This isn't 'Suspiria' or some Lynch masterpiece where it's clever enough to uphold symbolic colours. This is Lohan stripping for men with a severed finger, where her mother actively listens to her having sex. If that sounds like the film for you, enjoy! To everyone else, avoid."

The movie is rated R, if your going to have a stripper scene, make it realistic. I wouldn't go to a club to see that. I only went for 2 or 3 smokes during the film so I missed some scenes. Maybe that is why I rated higher. One thing that is funny. This movie does not show the FBI as the smartest people in the world. If this was a real case.

Very good as horror flick too - especially for women because Lohan won't be distracting your date.\n\nThere were some plot reasons for assigning the main character a job as stripper but I think with 3-5 minutes more they could have changed the profession and avoided a lot of critical defamation.\n\nOverall it probably would have been a good idea to drop the stripper profession in favor of some other hard profession where weird, unlucky, hardcase personalities are accepted, targeted and not immediately believed by police -- maybe metermaid or cosmetic door-to-door sales.\n\nAny big serious movie with main character strippers will always be panned. It automatically offends before viewing 80% of female critics, most anyone who specifically claims delicate refinement (most gay critics whose artistic clich\u00e9 sets the stereotype for critics), and any religious/family values critics (who in the PC age make up most the other critics). Then add a very gory tale and you have a movie which rarely will see critical success.\n\nFrom the audience side quite few males went primarily to see Lohan bare something and were quite disappointed when she didn't. To be honest I was sort of interested in what seeing what she looked like from all the Entertainment News raves. The girl looked distinctly unhealthy throughout probably not just from the gore nature of the movie but also I think her rumored alcoholism and too much sun and partying were evident."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie shows that my strategy of knowing only stars and genre about a movie before seeing it, actually pays off. I just read somewhere that it got a prize for being the worst movie of 2007. I knew that it was just because LL got a bad press in middle America (which seems to be all America these days) so i decided to give it a go. I was a bit afraid to see a grown up LL, however. This is a good thriller. The story-line is a bit surprising at times, when you don't overthink it. Sure, if you really try and think about all the possibilities you will have figured it out before you've seen half the movie, but be honest: which movie has surprises for the seasoned movie goer?\n\nAnd while LL might have lost her Parent Trap appeal (the freckles, although this film shows that she still has some on her back) she can actually act. Most negatives here are cheap shots at LL's behaviour outside the film, or stock replies like bad-bad-bad or morons who went to see this expecting the gore from Saw and Hostel, I mean, how stupid can you get?\n\nI kinda hated Ormond though, I don't see why she had to speak in that awful accent.\n\nThe only thing what was a bit disappointing was the actual identity of the killer. But hey, you can't have it all. And Lindsay shouldn't do stripper like roles with the reputation she's got. Now, if Alexis Bledel did it ...\n\nAll in all good film in it's genre, and it's not afraid to break some genres along the way."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"I Know Who Killed Me\" is a vile little horror outing that was designed as some sort of \"comeback\" vehicle for Lindsay Lohan back in early 2007. Needless to say, the movie did not succeed in that endeavor. Anything but.\n\nLohan plays Aubrey Fleming, an attractive, but relatively naive high school student who falls prey to a torture-crazed serial killer who manages to slice off a few of her limbs before she miraculously escapes his clutches. When she wakes up in the hospital, she believes herself to be a girl named Dakota Moss, some kind of fictional \"alter ego\" with a life straight out of a soft-porn novel - which provides us with ample opportunity to ogle the scantily-clad Lohan as she writhes around in slow-motion performing pole-dances at a sleazy strip joint. Is Aubrey, who is herself a writer of fiction, simply a victim of repression, a wild and free spirit so obsessed with being a \"good little girl\" that she's allowed her true nature to remain buried in her subconscious all these years? And is the trauma she's undergone simply the vehicle through which that true nature can now come to the fore? Or is there another, less purely psychological explanation - let's say, symbiotic twins? - for this sudden shift in identity?\n\nIt doesn't really matter what the answers to those questions are, for this depressing foray into sadism, dismemberment and supernatural hocus pocus is poorly written, amateurishly acted and completely lacking in either thrills or common sense. Actually, the story itself might have had some validity had it not forced the audience to wallow in as much gratuitous unpleasantness as it does. But, as it is, whenever we begin to develop even the meagerest interest in what is happening, we're subjected to yet another round of stomach-churning bloodletting. Yuck."

After reading a few of the other reviews I must start by saying I agree with them, the acting appeared terrible. However, I feel that has less to do with the actors and more to do with the direction. If any of the great actors of our time were sent in a room to read a line without understanding context they too would look awful. The acting parts seemed rushed to make way for the ridiculous camera effects. I swear some of the actors were reading their lines for the first time and probably thought this was a rehearsal! They too probably though the words coming out of their mouths were ridiculous and expected them to be altered.\n\nAs for those effects I mentioned, The Sixth Sense used red as a subtle clue throughout the movie, this movie used blue. There was nothing subtle about the blue however, and it served absolutely no purpose. There was also a number of other random shots than made no sense, and a soundtrack that was so terrible it ripped away any immersion and simply made me wince. I did feel like the director was trying to pull on aspects of M Night Shyamalan, but also a little Tim Burton in places, and maybe even Quentin Tarantino. It was simply a mess.\n\nThe story was vaguely decent though. More and more often these days I find myself willing to give up on a movie before the end, but this had enough to keep me going. I honestly think with better production this could have been a much better movie. Maybe a remake sometime soon?"

Meanwhile, her twin sister, Dakota Moss (also Lohan) wakes up in a hospital and discovers mysterious wounds on her right hand and right leg, before solving the mystery of her killer, Aubrey's piano tutor Mr. Norquist. Atop of the recycled murder mystery plot, those ridiculous blue operating tools, the goofy gore scenes, and the ludicrously preposterous twin stigmata syndrome, here are some of the billion plot holes that earned I Know Who Killed Me its eight Razzies. If Aubrey was buried during the investigation, then why isn't Dakota slowly rotting away like real corpses? In fact, wouldn't she be out of breath by the time she got to the killer's house? For that matter, if Aubrey and Dakota are twins, how could their parents (Julia Ormond and Neal McDonough) not recognize her when Dakota walked in? How did Aubrey's dad end up from the cemetery to a coffin in the killer's lab within ten minutes? If the impact of one twin affects another twin, did Aubrey feel anything down there when Dakota had sex with her boyfriend Jerrod (Brian Geraghty)? And most importantly, why aren't the FBI agents brought into the case again even after Norquist died? I Know Who Killed Me is an extremely stupid movie with not much thrills and a lot more laughs.

When the small town she lives in is shocked to hear she had been abducted it is within their and the police's duty to find the young teen, played by Hollywood party girl Lindsay Lohan. We then see where Aubrey is. She is being tortured and her fingers and limbs are being cut off. When Aubrey manages to escape from the physcopath who has been hurting her, she collapses and wakes up in the hospital. To the surprise of the police, family and her friends and doctors she insists that she is not Aubrey Fleming and that she is a young sassy stripper named Dakota Moss. The film is then filled with so-called \"scary\" scenes and lines which are meant to make you think.\n\nSorry to say that I Know Who Killed Me is a complete mess. It is beyond belief the shabbiness and how pathetic the script is. The scenes don't connect and the story is almost comical. I think the people who made this film were more interested in the trendy blue & red screens which distracts the viewer continuously throughout the film. Lohan has always been a good actress, but this let's her resume down! She was disappointing. And yes, I am aware that she was in and out of rehab at the time and she was \"mentally challenged\" at the time of shooting this movie (late 2007, mid 2007 release) but Lindsay was also \"mentally challenged\" at the time of shooting the comedy Georgia Rule starring Jane Fonda (which was released just a little while before this mess) and Georgia Rule wasn't her best work either. The shock to think that people call this a physcological thriller or a horror. Watching Power Rangers is scarier than this garbage. Sorry, Lindsay.\n\n* 1/5 stars"

        "review_detailed_main": "I Know Who Killed Me is a film without an audience. It's too talky too often and doesn't have enough bloody violence for the gore hounds; there isn't enough sex or nudity for those out looking for a big, dumb erotic thriller; its plot is too muddled and not delivered with enough punch to satisfy those wanting a 'whodunit' whilst those looking for a filmgoing experience in which all the basics will hopefully come together and deliver something coherent with which we can engage, will come away befuddled and frustrated at both the sporadic and very wavy content and tone.\n\nIn short, the film is a disaster. A lost, wandering mess - desperately trying to deliver on several fronts but failing to do so on all of them. The film is a mediation of the serial killer sub-genre, incorporating elements of the psychological thriller; the erotic thriller; the video nasty and the comedy genre, but never really being particularly funny, interesting exciting nor engaging. There has to be some sort of rule within cinema when it comes to films that try to incorporate scenes of paraplegic; ex-strip-o-gram, serial-killer victims whom make love to young males as their mother listens below with a wry smile on her face, there just has to be. If there is, I Know Who Killed Me ploughs straight through it with such disdain and, I garner, a grin on its face ten times the size of that of the aforementioned mother.\n\nIt is Lindsay Lohan whom is dumped with the extraordinary task of bringing to life a certain Aubrey Fleming, or perhaps Dakota Moss, or maybe neither, or maybe both \u2013 a young and fresh faced girl that enjoys spending hours at her laptop, bashing out words and musings on things; lessons with a certain Douglas Norquist (Tofel) on playing the piano as well as..........dancing bra-and-stockings clad at a local strip joint as bikers and truckers of the hairy and leery variety watch on. Such a paragraph captures the overall feel of the film; an inconsistent and wavy tone which will gleefully chop from obligatory and deathly familiar scenes of suited forensics experts saying and doing the norm, to a close up of someone's ring finger being sliced off by a shard of glass, to a sex scene complete with some pretty out of sorts music.\n\nFrom the instant the film begins with its crane shot that hovers over a poster of a missing girl before providing us with a scream and a murder to establish what's happened quickly followed by a press conference full of cops and press members; you feel uneased, you feel as if something just didn't click right there; like something was done but not done right. You notice something, you notice how un-sleek and uneven that three scene process really was. The film thinks it has the right to be able to deliver clich\u00e9s, obligatory scenes and other scenes of great monotony before pulling a fast one right out of the blue in the form of a twist.\n\nThe awkwardness as to whether the film feels competent dissipates somewhat when Lohan's character, whatever her name was and whoever she really is, wakes up in a hospital; at which point the whole exercise just becomes plain stupid. Lohan's character(s) actually take(s) everything rather well upon opening her eyes; she's cynical, she's also lost an arm but she's cynical none-the-less, while the manner in which we're meant to believe this girl has 'changed' somehow, and is now more independent and strong willed, is to have her deliver a few f-bombs in a cringe-inducing manner.\n\nI can remember; many, many years ago, observing M. Night Shyamalan talking about the use of the colour red in The Sixth Sense and how red clothing, red balloons and other such props used at certain times were a visual signal for impending danger for the characters. I think the writer of I Know Who Killed Me, Jeff Hammond, saw the same tidbit because his script is littered with contrasting red and blues; take for example the spotlights in the strip club Lohan dances; the police siren bulbs at the crime scenes; the many instances in which close ups of red blood will be shortly followed by blue roses are all drummed into us \u2013 the be all and end all of it is that, yes, we get it: there's duality going on here; there's a sense of \"red and blue are different shades and you can easily tell them apart, but, y'know, at the end of the day, man, they're still, like, y'know, colours and that's what they share, man.\" Yes, we get it \u2013 Lohan thinks she's two different people; she looks into it, she's confused; we're confused; we're a bit fed up; she's a bit fed-up; she's missing an arm but she's willing to put that behind her when she has sex with someone; we're watching; we're even more confused; we get to see an online streaming video explaining duality and stigmata, but the only thing we can pay attention to is the little dial at the bottom as we check to see if it'll get as far to the right as possible in time with the video actually concluding.\n\nAccording to IMDb, director Chris Sivertson seems to have a history in being involved with the horror genre \u2013 I Know Who Killed Me is a step up from out-and-out schlock but it's so muddled; and so fabricated; and so mis-guided; and so mind-blowingly-dull for most of the time that the step up is only a very, very slight one. Where the film should be taut, it's hopping all over the place; where it should be somewhat frightening, it's just gross; where it should be intriguing, it just cannot shed that made for TV feel. Not a great effort."

I'm quit surprised with all the negative reviews this movie is receiving, i mean did i watch the same movie as other reviewers watched, i mean i thought that this movie is a really good one. Im not a Linsday Lohan fan, the fact is this is the first movie i watched for her, i must admit that this was a really nice and cool thriller, very very enjoyable movie. the script and plot were engaging and intriguing, it never dragged or slowed down or felt boring, kept me intrigued. Yes it did have some over the top gory scenes, but isn't that a good thing for adult fans of the genre, i mean how come SAW became so popular and recommended, if you don't like gore then don't watch it, but don't give bad reviews of the film because you are too weak to stomach these scenes, i totally enjoyed it !!! Acting was very good from most of the cast, as i mentioned before this is my first Linsday Lohan's movie i saw and i thought she did a good job. In summary, i thought that this movie was very enjoyable and one of the good movies of this summer, keeps you guessing till the end and has a good plot, so if you haven't seen this, my advice is to go ahead and watch it, it is totally worth it, i really don't get why too many people hate it, it succeeded as a thriller movie, what more do u want !!?? this was more enjoyable to me than : Captivity, Pirates of the Caribbean 3,Evan almighty and I pronounce you Chuck and Larry. so please guys stop the whining and just go watch another PG 13 Disney movie and leave the R rated adult movies for the grown ups !!!! 9 out of 10"

        "review_detailed_main": "First of i have to say that i wouldn't have watched the film because of all the negative reviews i read and on word of mouth by friends and family which didn't exactly make me want to go out and buy or rent it. If anything this film is one to be loved or hated and in most cases, hated, but i have to admit i actually liked the film, not that it was Oscar worthy or even a favourite of mine, but i would recommend it because although the film has it flaws, it does, in my opinion, have some good assets. Linsday Lohan (playing the dual roles of Abrey Fleming and Dakota Moss) plays both characters, who do differ in personality and background, with great passion and is extremely endearing to watch, displaying her dramatic and comedic talents in this dark thriller. Visually, the colours and direction are excellent; creating immense intensity and cinematically, colours that capture each girl (red and blue) being suggestive and extremely poignant. The story to some may seem far fetched, but it is-quite original and offers a lot of thought after i watched it. It can be a little hard to take in but i find it very rare for a thriller/horror to be chilling yet touching. Gore is evident in the film and at times can be quite irrelevant but does have a purpose, yet the \"less is more\" theory really should have been taken into effect in this situation. What made the film bad for me was the awful police/FBI characters that could have easily been in a film which was a parody, but in this film they were laughable, often displaying no emotion or passion, no drive behind the murdered victims. What really spoilt the film for me was the fact that Aubrey was alive, and as depressing as it sounds, i would rather have had Dakota find her dead sister and finding some peace in knowing where she was, even if she was dead. Without Lindsay Lohan i don't think this movie would have worked for me and i know many hated this film, i believe it is worth a watch and does hold some credibility."

Directed by Chris Sivertson, has a script by Jeffrey Hammond and Lindsay Lohan in the lead role.\n\nAt first glance, the central idea of the script seems worthy of a good thriller or horror movie. And indeed it is. The problem is the way it develops its concept. The script is totally overloaded with plot holes and paradoxes. Many people have criticized the overuse of cliche's but... well, horror film industry has literally lived with it since some years ago. For me, the problem isn't that, but the way these cliche's are framed and articulated. They just don't fit. The characters are also bad, don't have a proper development nor any personality. The central character, having two personalities, ends up not having anyone. The film is not clear about the existence of a twin sister, although its suggested. It tries to bet on bloody graphics but fails, and cinematography, sets and clothes opposes the blue and red colors (as the colors-symbol of the two different personalities of the main character), but that gives to the film a far-fetched and almost sickening visual, worthy of a B movie from the seventies. The soundtrack is bad and Lindsay Lohan gives again profs to be a bad actress and a stripper and pole dancer absolutely mediocre."

Two weeks later she re-appears with the same injuries as the dead girl. But she doesn't recognize her parents and says she isn't who everybody thinks she is. She gives another name and background, but the same date of birth. What happened? I must admit I never saw the Brothers Grimm style solution coming until well into the second half of the movie, let alone the killer's identity. So as a thriller, this works reasonably well. Predictably, it's less impressive as an acting showcase for tabloid tramp Lindsay Lohan. Not that she's any less convincing than your regular teenage scream queen. But dancing on the pole, she looks like she's doing a Weird Al Yankovich impersonation of herself. How does she manage to look so old when she is only 21? I liked her a lot better when she was doing electro pop on top of a skyscraper. And what the heck did Julia Ormond do to end up in the part of the suburban soccer mom, frantically cleaning the kitchen as her crippled daughter is having her brains screwed out in the upstairs bedroom?"

Her right hand has been chopped off and her leg is partly cut. Everybody believes that she has suffered a split personality creating Dakota. That is everybody except Dakota.\n\nThis is a mess of a movie. There is an overall brooding and confused tone. Aubrey is not set up well and I don't care about her. There is a long middle with questionable dream sequences or confused reality. By the end, I don't care what is real and what is imagined. The movie is one long series of Lohan trying to shed her bubbly childstar image. She gets tortured but it's done weakly. She's stripping but she's not naked.

When She manages to escape, the traumatized girl who regains consciousness in the hospital insists that her real identity is that of Dakota Moss, a stripper in a seedy club and that the real Aubrey is still in mortal danger.\n\nI definitely can understand why this movie won SO many razzies. Lindsay got worst actress....Come on guys! She wasn't that bad, I thought she was great in this movie.\n\nThe idea for this movie is great, although they conveyed those ideas so wrongly, and in the confusing order. The storytelling attempted a \"Grudge-like\" storyline which made the initial plots very confusing. This films focuses on Identical twins who are in 2 different locations, the film doesn't explain which one is which,seeing as they are both introduced non-chronologically. There are also too many things going on at the same time. There's the stalker-killer guy plot, then the whole twin plot and then the self-bleeding wounds idea. To understand this complicated movie, you have to watch it over and over again.\n\nAt first you will find this movie extremely boring, there are many scenes which are too long or pointless, which shouldve been either shortened or even deleted.\n\nAfter watching this around 7 times I have now learned to like it. I love its unique look that it holds, with colours of blue and red which pattern each scene, you will find that in every scene the colour blue is there, almost in every shot. The horror scenes contain gore as gross as Hostel. The soundtrack is amazing by the way!\n\nI Know Who Killed Me is such a good film, but has a few things wrong with it. This IS a good film, just give it a chance and be patient with the long boring scenes which separate the good parts. Ignore all the Razzies it won because trust me, I bet there are worse movies out there, with worse actors,directors and writers."

The blue was overused, but it was all about that: Aubrey the blue ribbon and Dakota, the leftover red ribbon that lived a very hard life.

Yes, Lindsay Lohan DID suck, but she was not the sole reason for why this movie wasn't good. As you get deeper into the story (when I say deep, I do not mean that this is a \"deep\" movie, I mean it as you get farther into the movie) you come to find that the basis for why she doesn't know who the Hell the Aubry chick is, is just not probably possible. Why Lindsay Lohan #1 is this perfect girl that strives to become a writer (aka--the character that seemed to be a little bit too hard to play for the actress now). Lindsay Lohan #2 is supposedly the daughter of crack addicts and a stripper and is more believable because it wasn't a huge stretch from her real life.\n\nAll is not lost in this movie, however. There are a few scenes that had some really strong moments. The one that truly struck out to me was the one with the mother (played by Julia Ormond who is the one lone spot of light in this dismal movie) and LL #2, basically most of all because LL didn't speak a lot during it. I felt for Julia Ormond as I saw her performing strongly next to LL who just failed.\n\nI give this 4 stars because of a plot that wasn't THAT bad, but the casting agent just couldn't find the actors that could pull it out. The acting is the main downfall to this movie, not the plot. True, the plot still has a good amount of holes in it, but it was terrible."

The girl is identified as Aubrey; however, she insists her name is Dakota and does not know her parents or friends. Dakota's personality is not like Aubrey's. She says she is a stripper and her mother died from drugs. The Flemming's take Dakota home with them; hoping to get their daughter back. Dakota insists her limbs just started falling off. The twist at the end is more than far fetched. The explanation for how fingers and legs could just fall off was more than silly.\n\nAs many have said, Lohon is pretty bad in this. And her stripper scenes make her look used and cheap. This in not the script to pick for someone trying to move their movie career along.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: This movie is so bad that it might actually be one of those films people watch to get a chuckle and play a drinking game.

While the actors themselves did a pretty good job, the writers and directors destroyed any chance the film had of success. And who can forget the holes?

For example, the psychiatrist gives up by calling the patient \"delusional\", something that no respected psychiatrist would ever do. Simple, easy outs that the writers used to move the story along.

A week later, she turns up in a ditch and believes she is a completely different girl with a completely different history. Can she track the killer? Is she this other girl or just delusional? Can this plot make any sense at all?\n\nWell, I can answer the last question: no, it won't make any sense. There are many parts where the plot seems just fine, but the more questions are answered, the less sense the entire script makes. I did watch it a second time, and although I felt the first half would be complete nonsense knowing how it all ends up, it actually does help. Even after about ten or fifteen minutes, you'll start to get the impression this film is wasting your time. Trust that instinct!\n\nI can try to say nice things. The creators obviously wanted to make this an art piece... the constant theme of blue objects standing out (blue glass, blue roses) was a good idea... but they just tried too hard and it went from what should have been subtle artistry to \"hey, look what we're doing!\" in-your-face blatant artistry. A real turn off.\n\nThe torture scenes were good. Real good, actually -- possibly the only parts that really looked good. The burned limbs and such were well conceived. I was never grossed out or anything, but thought this was about as close to reality as I have ever seen in a film with torture.\n\nThe guests were okay. Seeing lonelygirl15 in a movie was weird and she looked even more awkward in this way. She has an unusual face that's either pretty or deformed, and I don't know if it works outside of YouTube. Art Bell's appearance was awesome and unexpected, but this is also another aspect of the film that was just silly. They make a detour into discussing stigmata, which is outlandish. They try to blend it in, but they may just end up making less sense.\n\nWhere does the boyfriend disappear to? I can't discuss the end of the film, but keep your eye on the boyfriend and see when he does and doesn't show up. At some point, he just stops appearing... why?\n\nIf you're watching this for Lohan's striptease and sex scene, you may be disappointed. The stripping was nothing hot (and she's never nude). The sex scene was a bit better, but nothing worth watching the film for. Really, this was making a promise to the audience they couldn't fulfill.\n\nPlease don't watch this film unless you want to be frustrated, confused and bored. So many plot holes appear as the film goes on, and I can't even attempt to fill them. Was there a baby purchased from a crack addict? Does the main character have a psychic link that can be brought forth in her writing? I have no idea. The film falls apart so fast and just finds more and more ways to fall apart as it goes... ugh.\n\nIt does make slightly more sense on the second viewing, and maybe still more on the third, but is it worth that? No. If the DVD had a director's commentary so he could at least try to justify this, that would be better. Maybe you'll like this one if you like \"The Box\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "Maybe because it's Lindsay Lohan's way of telling the cinematic world she's grown up now and would like to be cast in more mature roles, with her taking on dual characters here as all American rich girl next door Aubrey Fleming, and white trash stripperella Dakota Moss. Like Anne Hathaway before her who had shed her clothes to announce her arrival (in both Brokeback Mountain and Havoc), Lohan prances around in skimpy costumes, gyrating on a dance floor showing off her pole moves, but yet stopped short from showing what she has already exposed in real life.\n\nHer public demeanours aside, which has seen her flash skin (intentional or not), smoke, drink and drive, all hopes of this movie being her vehicle to show what she can do beyond those cutesy teenage roles, go up in a puff of smoke. I Know Who Killed Me sounds like a cheap cousin of the clich\u00e9d I Know What You Did (insert favrourite season here), and works out for the most parts suffering from multiple personality disorder. It cannot decide whether to be a psychological thriller which tickles the mind, a mystery with tons of smart red herrings thrown about, or a gory torture porn movie which really strayed too close into the Elisha Cuthbert Captivity copycat model.\n\nLohan as Aubrey disappears in a small town which had been rocked by a series of missing girls and bizarre killings. Naturally everyone gets worried that Ms Freckles will become a victim, and when she's found, she suddenly deems herself to be a certain Dakota Moss who have absolutely no idea why folks are claiming otherwise, and assisted by some nifty special effects that somehow just makes your skin crawl. So on everyone's insistence she's not who she claims she is, and going down the road of delusions, I'll actually be quite glad if it took that straightforward path, rather than meander through indecisiveness, showing a little of everything, including cheap shock horror tactics, before providing that all important plot twist to stamp its mark and steer the movie henceforth. Credit though to that twist which was something of interest to me at least, but nothing that had already not been done before.\n\nWhat the story clearly lacked was a strong central villain, instead opting for the obvious clich\u00e9s in playing coy with his identity. The movie throws up a whole truckload of supporting characters, and most of them, especially the police folk who were so involved in cracking the case ala CSI style, gets so conveniently forgotten midway through. Subplots introduced were relying too much on many coincidences, and when they do not logically work out, gets dropped wholesale too. All these boiled down in demonstrating the scatterbrains at work here, in dabbling with and experimenting, but leaving those unwanted test results still in the movie.\n\nBut as mentioned, I Know Who Killed Me is an avenue for Lohan to show that she's bad, and really really bad. But there's absolutely no need to show she's notorious at flirting with the gardener with her come hither looks in tight clothing. She smokes and she drinks, and doesn't demonstrate anything else beyond being the tabloid fodder she has made out to be in recent times. Watch this if only you enjoy being teased by the local distributors - violence and gore is good and uncut, but love making with clothes on gets the snip for the call of the dough."

        "review_detailed_main": "**SPOILERS** Garishly photographed in intense blue and red colors the movie \"I Know Who Killed Me\" gives us a clue to what's about to happen within the very first few minutes of the film. This all has to do with honor student and future concert pianist Aubrey Fleming, Lindsay Lohan. Aubrey is torn between following her music teachers Douglas Norquist, Thomas Tofel, advice in putting all her efforts into a musical, playing the piano, career or Aubery's real love in becoming world famous mystery writer.\n\nDuring the opening sequences of the movie there's a search for this missing girl, Jennifer Toland, who's eventually found murdered with her right hand and lower part of her right leg amputated. Jennifer will play a major part later in the film to not only bring out what the motives of her murderer was but how they connected her to both Aubrey and what later turned out to be her identical twin Dakota Moss also played by Miss. Lohan.\n\nAttending a New Salem high school football game to see her boyfriend the teams star running back Jerrod Pointer, Brian Geraghty,in action Aubery is later kidnapped by this Man in Blue who holds her hostage for some two weeks. Aubery is brutally tortured by her abductor and left for dead on the side of a road outside of town. Found with the exact same injuries as the late Jennifer Toland, an amputated right hand and foot, it's believed by the local police that Aubrey's abductor and Jennifer's murderer are one and the same person.\n\nThe big surprise comes later when Aubrey regains conciseness and insists that she's not Aubrey Fleming at all! She's a stripper who works out of the Strip Nightclub in the red light district of town called Dokata Moss!\n\nThe film has a difficult time getting the ball rolling in what exactly Dakota's state of mind really is. Is she really who she says that she is and if true were does that leave Aubery Fleming? The unseen killer, or kidnapper, had somehow overlooked the fact that he had two, Aubery & Dakota, victims whom he kidnapped and brutally tortured were in fact related related to each other! One of them, Dakota, not only wasn't whom he wanted to do a job on, by torturing and leaving her to die, but that in the end she would be the one who does a job on him!\n\nFar too confusing to really follow \"I Know Who Killed Me\" leaves so many loose ends that you feel in trying to understand it's storyline that you'll slip and fall on your head like you would if you forgot to tie your shoelaces when you got dressed in the morning.\n\nLindsey Lohan in what may be, I'm not really sure, her first adult acting part is surprising good as both Aubrey Fleming and Dakota Moss. I never expected Miss Lohan to be that believable in her two parts in the movie with all the bad publicity that she's gotten over the last two years as an out of control drug and alcohol abuser. The really big surprise in the film is not that both Aubrey and Dakota are really identical twins it's that their mother as well as father isn't Audrey's and Dakota's real parents Susan, Julia Osmond, and Daniel, Neal McDonough, Fleming! Thats' what fooled everybody in the movie and most of all the Man in Blue who's both Aubery and Dakota kidnapper and torturer as well as Jennifer Toland's murderer! That major mistake on his part in the end was what not only tripped The Man in Blue up but caused the confused psycho to expose himself where he ended up getting run through by a hysterical and wildcat-like Dakota Moss!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I loved this movie! I trust that most of the people who choose to see this movie will be intelligent enough to form their own opinions, without being influenced by movie reviewers. If I allowed movie reviewers to sway my interest in seeing a movie, I'd miss a whole lot of great performances.\n\n\"I Know Who Killed Me\" is an exciting roller-coaster ride that combines the best of several genres: thriller; horror; crime and mystery. One fellow commenter on this site compared it to Twin Peaks. Those of us who love the works of David Lynch will see similarities in the use of color (blue in this case) and the \"film-noir\" feel of the production. I do not mean to say that the director was attempting to model his movie on the style of Lynch. The similarities are most probably unintentional.\n\nIt is very unfortunate that Lindsey Lohan had a few bad incidences in her personal life almost immediately before the national release of this movie. There is no greater death knoll for a new movie than bad publicity so close to its opening day. Yet, I feel confident that the intelligent viewer will be able to put the \"bad press\" to the side and enjoy this movie for its many strengths.\n\nThe movie was filmed with an side of gritty realism that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. The scenes of torture and mutilation seemed worse to me, by far than those in the movies Saw, Hostile or Captivity. In those other recent movies, the torture seemed staged to the point of unbelievability. In \"I Know Who Killed Me\" it was never overdone, and therefore seemed more believable. I really felt victims' hysteria because the scenarios seemed plausible and therefore much more realistic to me.\n\nThis is where I have to credit the cast for their very strong performances. I really was touched by the emotions generated by the parents of Lindsey's character and those of the first murdered girl. But, it was truly the amazingly powerful performance of Lindsey Lohan that drove this movie. She possessed her characterizations so completely, that I never felt the need to question the reality of what I was seeing. So, the bottom line is ... ignore the reviewers, keep an open mind, and you can't help but love this movie.\n\nP.S. Let's all try to be a little nicer to Miss Lohan. I know she's made a few poor decisions lately. But, the only difference between her and most young people is that her mistakes are broadcast simultaneously on MTV, CNN and the world-wide web. She has accomplished amazing things for her young years, with pressures that most of us could never imagine. I personally wish her only the best!"

Lindsay Lohan stars in this, well, not the best film, as a girl who is found after being kidnapped, and takes on her alter-ego. Not a bad plot, eh? But when it starts going, we see that while Lindsay was in her time of need, she was put through extreme torture. And I won't spoil it for you, but let's just say that there was no good reason for it. And when she comes back completely different, we see what she thinks that happened. Which is basically full of whores stripping, and transitions that looks like a toddler made them. With a twist that catches some people off-guard, and screams out to others, it really isn't all that good. See something else instead, or at least wait for it to come out on DVD where you can make fun of it the whole time with your friends."

Now, she's not only missing a hand and a foot, she's convinced she's another person...Dakota. And Dakota is nothing like Aubrey. Dakota is a stripper who smokes and loves hot sex...and she insists she is NOT Aubrey and gets angry when people contradict her. As a result, things are also quite awkward at home...at Aubrey's home with Aubrey's parents. To top it all off, Dakota/Aubrey has weird hallucinations...really, really weird ones throughout the film.\n\nA huge reason not to watch this one is that at times the film is torture porn. You get some very realistic scenes where the psychotic is cutting into Aubrey and it's NOT for the squeamish. My feeling is that just because you can make realistic and vivid violent scenes look real doesn't mean you should nor that you should show so much. This leads me to the opposite problem with the film. It's a sleazy skin flick...that never actually shows anything! Lohan strips and makes out....and manages to keep her clothing on and show nothing in a rated R film. While I have no interest in seeing her naked, at least that would have provided the viewers with SOMETHING interesting. Seeing her in a bra and panties dancing at a strip club just seemed weird and disappointing...same with her 'hot' scene with Aubrey's boyfriend.\n\nOverall, this is a silly and difficult to enjoy film...so much so that I am not surprised that it's currently #67 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list. It also was a HUGE winner at the Razzies awards, setting a record for most wins at the time. Poor and confusing writing as well as an unappealing leading lady sink this one. Worth seeing only if you want to see Lohan at her worst."

        "review_detailed_main": "I think this is the first time I actually paid attention to some visual detail that felt like symbolism. Usually I just ignore it, if I'm not in the mood to actually analyse the film properly. When I started watching I Know Who Killed Me, I first thought how weird the use of colour blue was sometimes. It was effective, but sometimes slightly annoying and weird. But since the colour was used so lot, alongside with the colour red, it was clear that there was some kind of meaning to that colour. Those are some strong colours, which affect the visual side of the movie a lot. They look extremely beautiful, but because of the ominousness of the film it was clear they weren't just colours this time.\n\nWhen I read the quick summary on Netflix, I actually thought the roles would be reversed: that the girl who disappeared would wake up in an identical body but have a completely different life. That version would be also interesting, since this way seems typical. It makes it seems that the girl who disappeared, Aubrey, had two personalities, or she's suffering from amnesia. I don't know if the approach the film makers took was original, since they built it in the way it became predictable.\n\nThis movie is mostly easy to follow, apart from a certain flashback. It feels like the movie just took another turn without any warning, and it doesn't even make any sense. Well, once the flashback is over it's easy to understand what had just happened. Still, it was quite a long flashback without any kind of warning - or did I just miss it? That's possible too.\n\nWhile I enjoyed the visual side of this movie, and Lindsay Lohan as an actress, the story just doesn't do it for me. It has a lot to offer, but that just seems to go down the drain. It's intriguing, but something is missing. It's thrilling, but not enough. The characters are interesting only on the surface, it doesn't feel like there's a lot under their skin. This film has serious Twin Peaks (and David Lynch in general) vibes, but they don't feel as true as whatever Lynch does.\n\nI feel like it's good to see this film once if you're interested in it, but it definitely isn't a movie everyone should see. You can live your life happily never seeing this film. I doubt I will watch this again."

I was quite sober, with some friends one evening, and we decided to rent it. BIG mistake. HUGE mistake. COLOSSAL mistake. I think you get the picture.\n\nWhen a girl is found on the side of a road one night, apparently having survived a harrowing ordeal, the parents of the girl (Lindsay Lohan) arrive to the hospital to anxiously wait by her side as she recovers. They believe she is the escaped victim of a serial killer still at large, but when she regains consciousness, she insists that she is not who they think she is. That her name is not Aubrey, but rather Dakota ... and that she is a stripper, not their daughter. She has visions that lead her down a dark path, to where she believes the serial killer may live resulting in what was supposed to be a shocking revelation.\n\nBy movie's end, all of us were shaking our heads and sighing with annoyance. It was poorly shot, the plot was ridiculous and just got worse as it continued, the ending was so absurd that I couldn't even believe what they were trying to pass off on us, the acting was some of the worst I've ever seen, and there were absolutely no real thrills in it. The only good thing I could find in this film was the use of color, especially the color blue. But ... that is it.\n\nMy only recommendation here is to avoid at all costs. You will actually feel stupid and cheated for having watched it. Not even the most die hard fan of Lindsay Lohan could appreciate this debacle. I am so surprised with Julia Ormond and Neal McDonough (usually appearing in good films) for accepting these roles. 1 star out of 10."

I suppose that was an M Night Shamalan (sorry to hack the spelling) attempt, but these guys are in no way MNS.

I have seen this movie three times already, and I feel it is artistic in a very dark, chilling way--but hey, it's a horror film; it's supposed to be that way! Helloooooo!\n\nReviewers have been talking about plot holes and ridiculousness; don't most horror movies have a measure of this (a murdering doll named Chucky? vampires in Alaska, coming soon to a theater near you?) Horror films require us to suspend belief in one way or another--heck, lots of other film genres require that, as well! Why all the bile for this film? (Oh, and let's not forget a little 1960's sci-fi TV series called \"The Twilight Zone\"; certainly no plot holes or reality suspension there!)\n\nI must admit that I probably would not have seen this film except for the fact that Miss Lohan stars in it, since I'm not in the habit of seeing horror films. Yes, I have a bias, and I am putting it out in the open, which is more than most commentators I've seen have done. As far as I see, Lohan has an intenseness and a force about her that few other actresses have, an earthy, in-your-face kind of energy that other actresses don't possess, as far as I'm concerned (and I realize her major problem is how to control that energy off-camera). This was a gutsy film choice for her to make, considering the subject matter and, of course, the fact that she didn't know how it would be received. She really went out on a limb on this movie--and yes, I know, people will be snickering that she sawed the limb off behind her-- and made an artistic choice, and, well, what can I say? Art is in the eye of the beholder, and this particular piece of art is disturbing, scary, dark, bloody, and so forth, but so what? It's supposed to be! I do realize that those reviewers, both amateur and \"professional\" (as if having a journalism degree and a job at a paper makes someone's opinion somehow more worthy than anyone else's) who laughed at or ridiculed this film are entitled to their opinions, but frankly, I can't see where they're coming from, and I don't share their venom and bile. Call me crazy, if you want."

Despite a promising premise, the plot quickly becomes convoluted and hard to follow. Lindsay Lohan's dual role performance feels forced and lacks the depth needed to carry the film. The script is riddled with inconsistencies, and the pacing drags, making it difficult to stay engaged. The film's attempt to blend psychological horror with a mystery thriller results in a jumbled mess that fails to deliver on either front. Overall, it's a disappointing watch that leaves more questions than answers, earning it a 3 out of 10."

I looked online and saw that this movie was called \"the worst movie ever\" and was completely shocked. I agree with the people that were saying they were judging it based on her personal life. It's a real shame that people can't see this movie for what it is. It's a really excellent movie that keeps you thinking :) So I really do recommend it to anyone & think you should at least give it a chance. I also loved Lindsay's acting & give this movie a 10."

I know it had real life problems, mostly stemming from Lohan; whether it was the paparazzi or her not showing up to set or the rehab or whatever. But still, there's too many other issues with the movie that don't have anything to do with that. There are tons of little moments throughout the movie that just aren't believable - I was constantly saying, \"but why would this person do that? Or that? That doesn't make sense!\" ... and so on. Unlike almost any other movie on the imdb bottom 100, I would like to see this movie get a remake, because I think it has potential to be good. But this is a hot mess."

The dancing scenes of Lindsay Lohan were really hard to watch, she doesn't have that super feminine rock hard body with the sexy attitude that would make these scene fun to watch, instead I felt like, please get off the stage, but the movie really dragged out these scenes. On top of everything Lyndy's makeup was very cringe worthy and she came off way older then a 16 year old."

Somehow I think that Lindsey Lohan's reputation at the time was reviewed more than the movie, which is miles ahead of most films in this genre. The dual personalities and the theme of separating reality from fantasy is very well positioned in the script, which brings a level of thematic to the piece that's rare for the genre, as well.

At first I thought the girl was psychological disordered, and those illusions were so vivid, summing up to be a perfect psychology nightmare. Later on it turned out to be a positive example of the myth about twins. The whole movie felt like a nice adventure. What else do you want?"

Would it have been a better film without Lindsay Lohan in it? Probably, but that's just because it would make it less predictable for those who couldn't suspend disbelief while watching the movie. Some of the scenes are hard to watch, Black Swan style, other's reminded me of Mulholland Drive. If you're looking for a run-of-the-mill (even a B) horror movie or seeing Lindsay Lohan get naked, move along.

When people talk about the captivating creepiness of \"No Country for Old Men\" I can't but feel that this movie does that movie even better. The script and its delivery is reminiscent of another creepy mood piece \"Dark Water\" released in 2005. The color, the mood, the seamless use of strange and off-balance sequences and visuals fit perfectly with the nature of this movie. Unlike the chaotic, unnaturalness of the non-linear sequences found in \"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead,\" the director incorporated a cinematic technique that natural for this type of movie, it enhanced the craziness and the almost psychotic experiences going on. Unlike the flat performance of evil in \"No Country for Old Men\" that captivates, this movie instead captures an intensity of victimization, the harshness of a dramatized reality. Unfortunately, perhaps too many people focus on the disturbing scenes of female rebellious youth, sex, drugs, strong offensive language, female strippers and find abhorrent behavior, repulsive dislike while at the same time able to accept an anti-social psychotic killer. Lindsay Lohan presents a credible performance that isn't sleazy nor cheap. The two weaknesses, if there are any, would be a few off-key talking scenes with Lindsay's script that for some reason feels uncertainly stilted and some possible credibility issues with the plot (though one would have to watch this movie a number of times to be certain). Nevertheless there is a richness and disturbing resonance in her looking for her killer and perhaps even herself. The final scene is more telling than almost any movie this year just because of its relevance to Lindsay own life. My accolades to Lindsay for a great movie! Eight out of Ten Stars."

Aubrey doesn't know who is killing her, so she retreats to her mind and to avoid the pain and try to make sense out of why this is happening to her.

Does Aubrey has multiple personality disorder, or maybe she is an engineered twin for an experiment (take note of the similar faces of the 2 previous girls maybe they were both engineered twins and killed as well), or Dakota really is a twin... These are just decoy plots. Every time Dakota feels pain..thats not Dakota thats Aubrey feeling it. Every vision Dakota has is not a vision .thats Aubrey seeing the situation. The movie's first viewings purpose is to make you think the story is going in a different direction. Only at the very end does it become clear and the movie comes into focus. It should hit you in the gut that Aubrey didn't make it. Its sad. It should make you angry because Aubrey is strong and not weak but she never had a chance to fight back.\n\nThe 2nd viewing you have the time to look at all the clues, because maybe the Piano teacher wasn't the one that killed her maybe thats just Aubrey's best guess before she died. Maybe it was the strange man on the bus. Maybe its the psychiatrist. Maybe the killer is hidden in her mind. Maybe no clue in her mind will help her solve the mystery. I like to think Aubrey got it right and figured it out and gave her self some comfort for solving the mystery.\n\nPeople that criticise the movie, including newspaper critics, just don't get the point of the movie. It goes right over their head. They can't see it even though its right in front of their eyes. One could start to suspect where the movie was heading when the \"strange\" explanation for Dakota losing body parts was explained by \"Twin stigmata\". This is a fantasy, they could of equally used Voodoo or witchcraft or alien invaders as fantasy substitutes. Then when Dakota decided to drive with her father to the piano teachers house (with out back up or calling the police i might add) the direction of the story should of become suspect. When Dakota said \"I think i know who killed me\" the audience should of started figured it out, because why would Dakota say \"I think i Know who killed me\" it doesn't make sense, Dakota was never touched by the Piano teacher, nor was she being killed, she said it because she was Aubrey and Aubrey was close to death and wanted to figure it out. Then Dakota finds Aubrey... it should become obvious that all of this is in Aubreys head. Dakota joins Aubrey because Aubrey is in her last breath. The movie ends and goes no further because Aubrey is dead. If it wasn't in Aubreys head then the next scene would show the next day at her dads funeral with both sisters on crutches. But, Aubrey is dead.\n\nThe movie isn't suppose to make you feel good. It should make you feel sad/angry/depressed/uncomfortable. It is not a normal happy Holloywood movie. But its tragedy will keep you thinking about it for a long time. the stripper scenes make you feel like the movie you see is real. If the ending was a happy ending the effect would not be the same. Aubrey dies... and its really sad and such a waste.\n\nI know who killed me is a good movie."

But she was. I'm not a fan of her at all but she was great. Yes there was some things that needed to be better in the movie. Like the strip scenes. We all keep saying if she plays a striper to make it more real she should have at least got a little naked but nothing. I can admit that was pretty lame. But her performance was great. Other actors on the other hand some weren't that good.\n\nI loved it though. It was exciting. Has mystery, and was a thriller. You really can't beat that in a movie. Some things could have been better but all in all i loved it and i wouldn't regret buying it for anything!"

When I try to think about the parts that I didn't like, nothing comes to my head. For crying out load, Lindsay Lohan is playing a stripper, just watch it! It is way better than many others in the genre. It has an original approach to the subject. I also liked the music. This is definitely one of my favorites. I would watch it anytime."

        "review_detailed_main": "I Know Who Killed Me is, without a doubt, one of the most creative and uniquely strange films of the year. Its quirky humor, bizarre plot, and poetic ending make this somehow a really great movie. Lindsay Lohan has always been known to give pretty good performances, but she is at her best here, in a role that seems taylor-made for the actresses' real-life chaos. Besides Lohan, there is really no one else worth mentioning in the mostly forgettable cast.\n\nAfter several disappearances occur in a small town, up-and-coming young writer Aubrey Fleming is kidnapped by a black figure and subjected to a series of grizzly tortures. Days later, she is found near a ditch, her hand in ribbons and her leg torn to shreds. But all doesn't seem to be as it appears. The girl that is found in the ditch claims that she is not Aubrey Fleming, but another girl named Dakota Moss. As the FBI and the police try to get to the bottom of everything, 'Dakota' has to piece together the puzzle and solve it before it's too late.\n\nAfter surprising me in the very enjoyable Georgia Rule, Lohan is at the top of her game here playing Aubrey Fleming/Dakota Moss, who is deeper than she appears. The stripping scenes are done very well, and the torture sequences are beautifully directed with intriguing camera angles and wonderful acting from Lohan. The blood and gore in this film actually looked very realistic, and thus it was mostly disturbing and disgusting.\n\nThe director, Chris Sivertson, actually crafts an interesting tale, and the use of a frightening atmosphere generates genuine tension and scares. I was absolutely in love with the film's cinematography and the constant repetitive use of the color blue. There is a lot of foreshadowing and interesting subplots. The thing that makes the ending so magnificent is that it can be interpreted in many various ways.\n\nPerhaps the best thing about I Know Who Killed Me, however, is that the film never takes itself too seriously. The script is written with a sort of 80's vibe to it, and it plays out like an old-fashioned but stylish 80's slasher movie. I liked the plot a lot, and I found the film to be very original in many parts and full of plenty memorable scenes.\n\nI Know Who Killed Me was a very fun, intense, frightening roller coaster ride of a horror film that never takes itself too seriously, which is probably for the better. Lindsay Lohan gives a wonderful performance, but the supporting cast is poor, to say the very least. I liked her boyfriend a lot, and I wish he had played a bigger part. I Know Who Killed Me was intelligent, and it was one of my favorite horror films. 9.5/10"

Lindsey did a good job. She acted very well and i found her very interesting to watch. In contrast with the Disney things this was very sexy and adult. The torture scenes were intense but not very disturbing. I think people in America are easy to provoke and Lindsey made a very brave choice by doing this movie and that should give her credit. I hope she comes to Europe to act in some film noir movies because she can do better than the films she did until now. Lindsey has talent and hypocrite Hollywood doesn't want to see this. Lindsey proved with i know who killed me that she is a rebel and i hope that she will continue going her own way."

But I loved that it was hard for me to figure out.\n\nThe best indication of how successful the script writer was is that the comments from the people he was attempting to entertain show such knowledge of films, create such beautiful turns of phrases, and OMG even use \"correct grammar\", etc., etc. But I think I understand what the writer was trying to provide for all of us who were this strongly affected by the movie.\n\nFirst of all, a writer needs to select an audience, and this guy sure picked a doozy of one. It must be the hardest audience to try to entertain. It takes one to know one, so he must be like all the others of us who have written comments (I'm basing this claim upon having skimmed 20 comments). I believe that his script was aimed at the minds of everyone who can almost always anticipate a minimum of 90% of the \"twists and turns\" in any plot and often even the exact dialog that will appear on the screen within the next 15 seconds to 120 minutes or so.\n\nIt's so easy to watch a movie and roll your eyes because the people who collaborated on a script weren't as empathic, intelligent, creative, or nontraditional as you are.\n\nBut for someone to actually be this successful in touching the most untouchable audience of all with his first movie script... well, we all better keep our eye on this guy.\n\nOh, and although I could hammer so many aspects of the film, I LOVED that in my case my usual ability to predict what would come next dropped from 90+ to maybe 20%.\n\nThere is nobody in an audience as sophisticated as this who hasn't known all their lives about the basic concept underlying this movie. But ask your self this... what might the movie have been like if a scriptwriter like this hadn't written it? Would the surprising impact this script had upon you have inspired you to leave any comment whatsoever?"

I can see this movie seems to have received a terrible overall score on this site, and a brief look at Wikipedia tells me it had a derisive response. Well, all this is undeserved.\n\nI saw this film on TV late at night in Australia, it was labeled here as \"horror\": perhaps so, dunno: it wasn't scary, this movie seems to transcend genre. I won't delve into the plot - others have done this for me. As for genre - this movie seems to move between psychedelic and some implicit sci-fi. The blue roses that crop up in the story: they don't exist in nature, and if they can be bred - probably are not cheap. The dual Fleming/Moss character is badly mutilated pretty much at the onset, and receives bionic prosthetics that seem to be gleefully taken for granted in the film - but do not exist in reality. And this entire plot is entirely set in our reality, not in some alternate sci-fi world.\n\nI loved Lindsay Lohan's and Julia Ormond's performances. Ormond's beauty was very much tempered down for this movie.\n\nI will see this again if I have a chance."

The problem is, in my opinion, that the writer meant to say something different. The metaphors and symbolism are more simplistic than one might think. I liked the 'red vs blue' theme and I think this film would've, (or could've) been fantastic.\n\nThat is why I am giving it an 8.

        "review_detailed_main": "...But I know I'm in the minority. So goes the drama with the teenage drama queen Lindsay Lohan and her recent legal troubles of late. As is the case, she is the latest Hollywood \"it\" girl to fall prey to drug and alcohol abuse, and to have her drama splattered all over the tabloids (which surely gets more attention than any new movies she appears in). Such that it might dog Lohan's new thriller \"I Know Who Killed Me.\"\n\nI'm one of the few willing to brush aside a drama queen's drama (I don't know, maybe because I know deep down a real actress is trying to prove herself, or, I had nothing better to do on this Monday afternoon but waste $7.25 on the latest Hollywood thriller). Although the former is true for me, others would choose the latter. In \"I Know Who Killed Me,\" Lohan is the latest pretty face to grace today's brutally violent thriller genre, where said pretty face gets a chance to do something apart from the teen genre and does some real \"acting.\"\n\n\"I Know Who Killed Me\" doesn't offer much new to the industry, abiding by typical thriller conventions in a plot about a twisted serial killer who abducts teenage girls, tortures them, and then dumps their bodies once he's through mutilating them while they're fully conscious. The film comes to us from an undistinguished first-time screenwriter (Jeff Hammond) and an equally undistinguished director (Chris Sivertson). But somehow, the raven-haired Lohan's competent dual portrayal here (yes, it's another thriller where we see double, which of course, means more trouble) elevates what could have been a forgettable \"Z\"-grade thriller to a better, more respectable \"B\"-grade status.\n\nAs Aubrey Fleming, a successful teenager with a lot going for her, Lohan is superb, even if it takes her, and the movie, a while to get going. A high school honor student with a gift for writing and playing the piano, her scholastic achievements don't save her from the diabolical psycho-killer who has been preying on pretty girls and mutilating them for days on end before disposing of their bodies. Subjected to having her digits hacked off with some very sharp instruments, it's an ordeal that she's very fortunate to survive.\n\nAubrey is soon discovered, minus one leg and a hand. Her parents (Neal McDonough and Julia Ormond) receive the phone call that their daughter is alive but doesn't remember who she is. Now calling herself Dakota Moss, a foul-mouthed stripper who also engages in booze and recreational sex, the doctors are convinced that her traumatic experience has allowed her to forge a new identity to help her cope with the ordeal. But Dakota, now a double amputee with some new state-of-the-art prosthetics, insists that she is who she says she is. And if she's telling the truth, then of course it means that the real Aubrey is still out there somewhere, being tortured by a really nasty guy with a fetish for sharp objects.\n\n\"I Know Who Killed Me\" won't appeal to most tastes. Some of you might not believe me, but Lohan keeps the project above water for the most part. In a dual role, she believes in the film enough that her performance is convincing, if nothing else. Not a whole lot happens during the first segment of the picture when Lohan is Aubrey, but when she becomes Dakota, we begin to see her in a new light. (Some may argue that this is the \"real\" Lohan here, the one who engages in frequent sex and abuses drugs and stuff like they were really nothing.)\n\nThe film's torture scenes are as unsettling as they could possibly get. There are some truly horrific things on display here (with limbs being hacked off left and right) as we get to take a look inside a madman's little shop of horrors. Sivertson does have a real eye for gruesome torture imagery, and his cinematography colors nearly everything in a hazy shade of blue. But at the end of the day, \"I Know Who Killed Me\" isn't at all a disappointment, even though it still seems like typical Hollywwod thriller stuff. If you put aside Lohan's recent legal troubles, then \"I Know Who Killed Me\" isn't that bad at all.\n\n8/10"

She's hoping to have a future career in writing than for her talent for playing the piano. One night, Aubrey disappear from her friends and her boyfriend (Brian Geraghty) after a college football game. Now weeks has passed... a stranger finally find her left for dead but she claims that her name is Dakota Moss. A young woman, who lives a difficult life and she's also a exotic dancer. Her parents are shocked that she doesn't recognized them and she doesn't know any of these people from Aubrey's life. The FBI thinks that Aubrey got so traumatized, that she adopts a new memory as Dakota. They also thinks that she might be living in the memory of Aubrey's short stories. Dakota feels that she might be a twin after remembering her life more than Aubrey. Especially since Dakota remembers losing her arm and leg like that suddenly just happen like that. Dakota feels that Aubrey still alive somehow (she's staring to feel her presence) and find her before Dakota might die as well.\n\nDirected by Chris Sivertson made an suspenseful mystery thriller isn't quite as bad as some critics said it was. I find myself enjoying this unusual film. True, it has some shares of its flaws and including a few unintentionally funny moments. But the intriguing premise written by Jeff Hammond has some fascinating ideas. The film might be a bit very heavy-handed for its visual style at times. The third act really slow down the movie, it becomes quite weak and predictable. But Lohan is surprisingly good in this film, playing two different characters. Her lap-dance sequences is quite tasteful (Although some male and female fans of Lohan's are probably disappointed, she's not nude in this picture at all). Her exotic dance moves are sexy enough.\n\nDVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (Also in Pan & Scan) and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes Alternate Opening & Ending, Extended Lap-Dance Scenes and Bloopers. I would have love to see an behind the scenes featurette and an audio commentary by the filmmakers. Since this movie was an box office disappointment, the studio felt this film didn't need any good special features. Fans of Horror/Thrillers and Lohan's work will find plenty of enjoy here than the causal viewer. This isn't the worst film, i seen that came out in 2007. There's worst movies than this one. There's some good scenes here and there. Best sequence is when Dakota character finds a loving bond between Aubrey's mother sitting on the couch, while watching a video of Aubrey's been not born yet. Which it's the heart of the picture. But in this interesting but misfired picture, it's more style over substance movie and John R. Leonetti's (Dead Silence, Detroit Rock City, Mortal Kombat) excellent cinematography are the highlight of this effort. For all it's flaws and occasional silliness, it's worth a look. HD Widescreen.

        "review_detailed_main": "first i must declare that yes the movie could have been better it lacks some professional work but it is far from being as bad as reviews make it look like maybe because they had to go out and see it in theater which usually amplifies disappointment , watching the movie indoors really have different measures anyway artistically there is not much here there is just \"stuff\" , gore only one or two scenes it is not a big deal but maybe that's why it made feel the pain more than the gore specialty movies saw..etc , another reason is that the victim is a cute lovely talented girl named Lyndsay lohan she was very convincing in the painful reactions next to gore there is a mystery which turns out to be nothing like any other clich\u00e9d mysteries , if you have seen other movies with the same mystery here you must say its name before claiming that this is a clich\u00e9 personally i ve never seen something like this in all kinds of horror movies , .haunting , serial killer , vampires , cult whatever , there is also drama which varied from good actors the mother \"julia ormond\" the father, and bad actors like the foolish boyfriend ,too bald sex scenes are the main negative point to me i really don't see why is it suddenly too important for film makers to show us one or two complete bedroom session on each film with all the details i think i know why because it helps selling there must be some kind of border line between porno and real movies conclusion this is a good movie that would appeal to you but you shouldn't expect much watch it at home while relaxing on your weekend of course i assume you like horror and female heroines"

        "review_detailed_main": "I just saw this three weeks ago and...I just loved it!!! I think this is a very intelligent movie with excellent actors. Lindsay Lohan was just amazing in this movie still with her personal problems. The story makes you think and it's really exciting. I gotta say that I'm a huge fan of Lohan since Mean Girls and I know that she's a great actress no matter what. The strong of this film are the love scenes and the blood, but I think it's amazing how all start to make sense.\n\nI recommend this film a lot, because it's one of the best thrillers ever made and Miss Lohan does a excellent job that disurb to be recognized."

        "review_detailed_main": "Most comments here are biased probably by the fact that his main character is Lindsay Lohan I see a lot of bashing , and i've seen worst movies, so this is not a bad one, if you skip certain details.\n\nThe overall script i think is very original, could be better of course, but it kept me on my sit the whole time.\n\nThe BAD: This movie could be better, but the cast was awful. Most actors can't act, and Lindsay who did a nice role, didn't warm me as stripper either.\n\nSome details were too stupid, like the \" time to make a phone call\", or the peaceful way in which Dakota seems to take his situation\n\nThe Good: The overall history, the photography, the way they portrait colors and his significance, the ending was nice also.\n\nI think the identity of the \"bad\" guy, is well chosen. I think people is mostly wrong in take the critics on that direction.\n\nIs a worthy movie, entertaining, strong scenes, but is intended to see it to enjoy it, not in critic plan , because that way is easily to stick on his flaws instead of have an entertainment moment with it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Maybe for a few that are missed but never in the film is forgivable. For others, I remain convinced that the bad reviews and ratings are just for the hate to Lindsay Lohan.\n\nLindsay Lohan, who nevertheless is doing very well here, even if another actress could play the role, and it's almost assumed that the critics would have flipped. However, I sincerely believe that the choice of Lindsay's a good idea, so may have noted that \"his\" role suits him like a glove.\n\nCome in the film and its inspirations, inspirations coming from as well as the \"Giallo,\" the great Brian DePalma, with a dose of Hitchcock. It gets worse as an influence, right? So if you like \"Giallo,\" DePalma, Hitchcock, and film of the 70s, do not miss out above and given a chance or second chance (for another) to the film.\n\nStill on the film, I will also mention the atmosphere particularly disturbing (Again if you like this kind of atmosphere, you will be served). So much blood flows here, so not a single \"Thriller\" formatted as many, sometimes these bloody scenes are also quite challenging.Challenging, certainly, but still used mostly in the plot.\n\nThe unfolding of the plot, which frankly attracted by its influences so, but because as I said before the film is not formatted it is not heated or otherwise seen.At least to what is seen in recent years.\n\nBy cons, it's a little more final, which some compared to the entire film. If the final (even if it is not what it is worse in final) had reached the level of the rest of the film, there was a small masterpiece.\n\nIn short, this film did not deserve a Razzie, so in the year 2007, it must have been much worse and much more formatted, on the big screen."

Those were some of her best, because they were all completely nuts, straight to video fare that turned out to be awesome. (Seriously, you need to check out Doppelganger - it's absolutely mental. Drew is and alien/shapeshifty monster).\n\nIts a pity Lindsay's not acting anymore - I was really hoping for a Drew-esque series of bonkers thrillers like this one."

It reminded me of the kind of bon-mots you find in a classic like \"I Dismember Mama\". And don't get me started about amputee fetishism! Hilaire! I give this knee-slapper 10 Belly Laughs out of 10. I laughed, I cried, I ran the gamut!"
