        "review_detailed_main": "I just got back from a special-screening of \"The Help\" at my local movie theatre, so I thought that I might as well do a review for all of you who are wanting to see this movie when it comes out.\n\nNow, first off, I must admit that I have only read a portion of the book, but I definitely do know a lot about it. After watching the trailer, I was intrigued, so of course, I visited the IMDb boards to learn more about it. At first glance, the casting caught my attention big-time. Emma Stone as 'Skeeter'? I bet most people were as shocked as I was to find out that she was cast as the main character -- but let me tell you what: the casting was superb! I could not have chosen a better cast than what was already chosen. There was amazing chemistry between both the antagonists and protagonists. I won't go into too much depth about the characters, but for me, Emma Stone, Jessica Chastain, Sissy Spacek, and Octavia Spencer were the shining stars of the movie.\n\nCasting: 9.5/10 I know that there has been an on-going issue about this movie from a lot of people claiming that \"the blacks had to be 'saved' by the whites\" (pardon the language), or something along those lines. I have to agree that the trailer does give off that type of vibe -- Skeeter saving the colored-folks -- however, the movie tells and depicts otherwise - the colored-folks actually saved themselves. Minny and Aibileen, as well as the other colored-folks in the community, were the real \"heroes\" of the movie; they just needed someone to push them to their potential (Skeeter).\n\nI can not remember the last time I saw a movie that inspired me, made me cry, made me laugh, and made me sad, angry, and hopeful, all at the same time -- this is what \"The Help\" strides and aims for, without making it \"cheesy\". Without a doubt in my mind, there are definitely Oscar-worthy performances in this movie. Not only does this movie depict just the colored-folks' side of the story, but it also equally shows the feelings of the white-folks, as well. So, you definitely get both sides of the story without it being more or less \"mean\" or \"degrading\" to any sides.\n\nThere are definitely a few awkward moments in the movie, but what movie doesn't have them? This movie started around 7:10 and ended around 9:20 -- about 2 hours and 10 minutes, give or take, if my calculations are correct. However, this movie only felt like it was an hour-long. It was so good that I didn't even know the two hours passed by until the theatre lights lid and the rolling credits began.\n\nAll in all, this is a DEFINITELY-MUST-SEE movie. I personally believe that it is one of the best movies of 2011. Go see it -- you will not regret it. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.\n\nMovie rating: 9/10"

The casting, directing and acting are top-of-the-shelf superb A+++. When my wife first told me about it, I said OK whatever. Man was I wrong!

        "review_detailed_main": "I just returned from seeing a special preview of \"The Help,\" which is due out in theaters this summer.\n\nOkay, so here's the truth: I'm a middle-aged, white male... I didn't read the book and I assumed, based on the fact that this is a virtually an all-female cast, that this was some sort of chick flick. Boy, was I wrong!\n\nThis is an incredible film that not only pays justice to the bestseller on which it's based (according to those who have read the book AND seen the film), but is phenomenally cast, with exceptional performances by Viola Davis, Emma Stone, Octavia Spencer, Bryce Dallas Howard and Allison Janney. Veteran actresses Sissy Spacek and Cicely Tyson also deliver incredible performances. While Tyson's character is central to the storyline, her role comprises what seems to be a few, precious minutes of the 2:20 running time, she delivers, in my opinion, one of the most powerful and moving moments in the film...one in which she doesn't even utter a line (trust me, you'll know when you see it.)\n\nThe Help also delivers some very funny moments and will make you laugh. I'll go so far as to say that this film and a few of its cast members will draw some Oscar nominations. I certainly think this takes Stone into a whole new level.\n\nThe racial imbalances of 1963 are well illustrated in \"The Help,\" and will, no doubt, underscore how far America has come, as well as how little progress we've made in the last 50 years. Either way, this is a powerful movie that needs to be seen on the big screen as soon as you can get a ticket."

I must say this movie was quite touching and very well done.\n\nThe cast is excellent with award worthy performances from Viola Davis, Emma Stone and Octavia Spencer - the main cast. The acting was amazing and there was great chemistry among the respectful classes of people in the film ( the whites and the blacks).\n\nThe script was well written and I love the balance of comedy and drama. There are some intense scenes however the comedy makes the movie more enjoyable rather than just a movie to make you feel sad all the way through. There was a perfects balance there and I loved that. The film also took you on a roller-coaster of emotions. Sometimes you were sad, extremely happy, angry or laughing. Its also one of those movies that can hold your interest from beginning to end.\n\nWith great performances, a brilliant script and a film so touching and inspiring, The Help is definitely a must-see!"

Entertaining yes but I couldn't forget documentaries of the period or \"The Long Walk Home\" with Whoopi Goldberg and Sissy Spacek. Sissy Spacek is in \"The Help\" too and she's very funny. It also shows Bryce Dallas Howard under a new light. The bitchy, almost evil light. She's better here than she's ever been. Emma Stone is lovely and the wonderful Allison Janney in a disturbingly recognizable character raises the film to unexpected levels. I felt the film was too long and too careful not to offend anybody and that's were its weaknesses lay. But, I do recommend it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Recently the other Dude and I were discussing that not many award worthy movies come out during the summer; then I see The Help. To say it is not a story that I am normally interested in would be an understatement. I wasn't around during the time of segregation to fully appreciate the depth of this story. Additionally, if there was ever a movie that screamed \"chick flick\" it would be this one. In spite of that, I've heard wonderful things about the book and decided to view the movie. I'm happy to say that I'm glad that I did. Virtually unknown director Tate Taylor put together a cast of relatively unknown actors and actresses that truly made the story go.\n\nTaylor, whose last movie was the little seen Pretty Ugly People, grabbed a familiar actress to join him in making The Help, Allison Janney. Other than Janney the only other familiar actresses in the movie are Cicely Tyson and Sissy Spacek. The rather unknown cast has a fresh feeling on the story and there are no preconceived notions based on a past actor or actresses work. That being said Emma Stone (Easy A), and Viola Davis had a true coming out party in The Help. Both women played fantastic parts, which really made the cast mesh nicely together. Bryce Dallas Howard, Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain were all spectacular in supporting roles alongside Stone and Davis.\n\nWhen a movie doesn't have the explosions, crazy action or crude humor that we've become accustomed to seeing in newer movies there has got to be a great story attached in order to maintain your interest; The Help had that great story. There aren't many movies that have you laughing, crying, or getting angry and end up still being fantastic and that is where this one had me. With my common rule of no movie should be over 2 hours unless it is special; this one is very special. I would be surprised if there aren't a number of nominations coming.\n\nChildren: If they can handle a lot of dialog it is age appropriate for 10+ Award Worthy: YES!

        "review_detailed_main": "I had eagerly awaited the movie as the book was an absolute masterpiece. I was rather disappointed.\n\nMy guess is that people who have not read the book will like the movie. It is well acted and makes for a good story -- just a different one from the story written in the book.\n\nOne semi major character is changed from a very complicated person -- sympathetic but hardly enlightened or heroic -- to something entirely different -- a converted true believer. Other characters simply become flatter and more \"stock\" than in the book -- though that may be inevitable when adapting a novel written in three first person voices into a movie.\n\nThe main problem with the movie is that it really does not attempt to capture the violence, brutality and fear of the period. In the book these things hang over the characters and there is a real sense of danger. In the movie \"danger\" is spoken of but hardly palpable. Segregationists (aside from the one villain, Hilly) appear more rude than brutal. As a (white) southern man who lived in that era I know it was a lot tougher than that.\n\nOverall, it is a good movie. If the source material did not exist I'd rate it higher. But being adapted from a much more nuanced and stronger work, it suffers in comparison.\n\nSee it. But read the book. And especially take young people to see it who may not be willing to read the book first. Because even glossed over, it does show a side of American history that the younger generation may not fully appreciate. Maybe it will spark discussion and maybe some of them will read the book for a fuller understanding of how things used to be."

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie The Help takes place in early 1960's Jackson, Mississippi. The film focuses on two main characters, Viola Davis as Aibileen Clark and Octavia Spencer as Minny Jackson who are African American maids that work for white families. The maids are paid 95 cents per hour but had the responsibilities to cook, clean and take care of the children. Aibileen, Minny and the rest of the African American community faced extreme obstacles of racism and segregation but couldn't stand up for themselves until one day, future journalist, Skeeter Phelan, played by Emma Stone, wanted write about the truth behind the cruelty African American maids face when working for these white families. The purpose of Skeeter's novel is to expose the truth about the way maids were treated and to empower the African American community. Skeeter's character plays a major role throughout the film. Her bold decision to go under the law to get all the awful stories about white families all the maids worked for gave the African American community a chance to share their voice during this time of silence. Not only does this expose the racial injustice within their community, it brings the gender inequality to light as well. Director Tate Taylor's creative direction gave this film the magic needed to create the realism added to this film. Director Taylor pulled the strings feeling like you're trapped in the film itself. Viewers felt like they were in the shoes of each character and felt each emotion the actors portrayed, deeply. By the end of the movie your heart ached so bad you couldn't help but cry. This film also uses humor to grab the attention of the audience and keeps them engaged the full way through. I sitting on the edge of my seat, laughing and crying the whole time. The Help is like a fresh breath of air after a ten mile run. This film gives you a raw new view on our country's history. Yes, the films tendency to take you on a rollercoaster of emotions is somewhat exhausting but it is well worth the journey. The films hand picked actors and actresses put on the perfect performance and most went on to win a few awards. The film peppers a few cruel characters in but keeps the limelight focused the heroines of the story. Most characters fall into the stereotypes during that time in the 1960's, but a few stand out from the rest. Skeeter phelan (Emma Stone), Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) and Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer). They are pronounced heros in this film as they are in combat with the patterns of society and racial inequality at that time. The Help is a very well known movie and has been awarded for its excellence. You might of heard of major awards like, Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture at the Academy Awards and Golden Globes. The Help won this awards from both ceremonies in 2012. This film was also nominated for multiple other awards, totaling up to 81 wins and 117 nominations. Others may know this story from the book, The Help, written by Kathryn Stockett and released in February 2009. The novel was a hit and sold over three million copies. The book received the Goodreads Choice Awards Best Fiction. This five star film brings their audience on an emotional journey with side effects of heart warming laughter and love for the characters and storyline. If you make the choice of watching this spectacular film, be prepared to feel a wide range of emotions with the first one being love. The wild humor and heart felt message will make it one film enjoyed by all."

The film is brilliantly cast , there being not a single dull moment. The film revolves around three very different women who form an unlikely friendship in their quest for a common goal. It is much more then just being about the state of events in the 1950s at the South .Its a portrayal of a waning tradition that still grips the peninsula even after a century of the Civil War which was fought to abolish the exact same custom. It raises serious issues - demarcation of people based on skin color , making another human being walk in incessant rain rather than allowing her(it?) to use one's own bathroom , makes us reflect that we still aren't very far along the vicious prejudice. The movie also touches upon how the untarnished mind of a child is capable to love the same person he would grow up to walk all over on, of how society can be a venomous influence in conditioning the brain on so much discrimination. In the end it also hints that even after being subjected to centuries of venom , the heart still has the capability to love, that there is still hope for all of us."

        "review_detailed_main": "While \"The Help\" has received TONS of great press and a ton of SAG and other awards, I am also aware that there is some controversy concerning the film. Some people have felt that the film was a bit paternalistic--as it might be interpreted as yet another story of a rich, enlightened white lady going out to help all the downtrodden black folk. I am just not sure if I could see this or not--especially as the black women in the film end up showing LOTS of strength during the course of the film. BUT, I am also a white guy--and it's not fair for me to automatically brand the film one way or another. Just be aware that there are a few who resent the idea of this film.\n\nI could discuss the plot, but LOTS of other reviewers have discussed this. So instead, let's talk about what I liked and didn't like. I liked the acting. The problem, however, is that giving any of these actresses awards is tough as it's such an ensemble cast. I can truly understand why the Screen Actor's Guild chose to award ALL the cast a joint award. The direction was very nice and the movie was well filmed. The script was also very nice--and quite inspiring. My quibbles are VERY small---very, very small. I felt that a few characters were a bit one-dimensional (particularly the lead villainess). Also, the ending of the film seemed to drag out a bit and wrapping it up a bit sooner. It wasn't a bad ending--but tightening would have heightened the overall emotional impact.\n\nSo my advice for you is to see this film. While I still think \"Hugo\" is the best nominated film this year, I can see the merit in \"The Help\" winning and \"The Artist\" sure seems to have a lot of momentum. So, do yourself a favor and see all three--all three are terrific."

I don't know how it is possible for white people in the USA not to watch films like this without squirming in their seats, not from guilt - for guilt is not something one inherits, nor is it automatically collective - but from the discomfort of seeing how badly people can treat one another, based entirely on the colour of their skin (or any of the myriad other silly little ways that are used to divide us as a society - how can any reasonable person believe such distinctions reflect a person's true worth?)."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Help is one of the many films that's set in the 60s that deals with themes like prejudice and racism involving segregation amongst the Whites and the African Americans in Jackson, Mississippi, but having the very same themes also being relevant in society today even here in Singapore especially, with recent talk and focus on the issue of domestic help and our attitudes toward household maids that many employ for various reasons, who assist in looking after the children and the elderly, as well as to keep home while the rest of the adults are neck deep in economic pursuits. While racism is generally kept under control here, there are niggling incidents that pop up every now and then, so clearly we're not off the hook and there will always be individuals who choose intolerance.\n\nGranted that racism back then was more pronounced especially during that era put on film, the story's based on an international bestseller written by Kathryn Stockett, and over here we're bound to identify with the issues highlighted especially in the horror stories you'd hear with regards to the treatment of domestic help, with abuse cases that make you sit up and wonder why we are capable of such inhumane acts. And the worst of all involves being hypocritical, putting on a false front for society, while clearly behaving like the devil when behind closed doors. The bottom line is, we're all humans and we share similar hopes and dreams whatever our skin colour, language and where we're from, in desiring a comfortable life filled with love, with a roof over our heads, food and community, friends and family we can turn to in times of need.\n\nWhich is why this film has themes and a poignant, thought provoking narrative that screams relevance, especially for those closeted intolerant few who must watch this, and reflect. Emma Stone stars as Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan, an aspiring journalist who has returned home only to find out that the group of peers she had grown up with, are leading a lifestyle of superficial leisure, saying a lot of things, but meaning nothing. And for all their cliquish behaviour in cruelly treating one of their own as a social outcast (Jessica Chastain from The Tree of Life), for an ulterior reason only Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) knows, what more their household maids who have to slog with the chores, be that surrogate mother to their kids, be at their beck and call, and being given attitude, stick, and threats of the sack?\n\nGiven the tension all round during the time, it's no wonder that Skeeter's plans to want to highlight The Help's predicament and provide them with a voice, no doubt also serving as a ticket for her journalistic ambitions to embark on a career in New York, all met with stone walled silence, until Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) decided that enough is enough, and begin opening up to Skeeter as research material, becoming her insights and perspective on how the African American help get treated in White households. And besides Aibileen's point of view, her friend Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer) also chipped in, and both represent the broad spectrum of heartfelt accounts both good and bad, though largely negative, with the tacit understanding with Skeeter that they are not to be referred to directly.\n\nIt's one of those powerful films that takes the ugly side of humanity and presents it to us face on, to confront how cruel some of us can be, and what the strong amongst us must do to act and help those who are weak or bullied. Director Tate Taylor, who also wrote the screenplay, focuses on the tales crafted around the households both Aibileen and Minny serve, from being treated like dirt to forming firm friendships with some of the people they know and serve, such as Celia Foote (Jessica Chastain), as a reminder on how we should never judge a book by its cover, being obviously relevant when one gets handed one's fate for being of a certain skin colour. You may think that this may be a heavy film with all its seriousness, but trust me there is enough light hearted, even heart warming moments scattered throughout, though counter-balanced with moments of fear that will make you worry for the characters since mob mentality can lead to anything.\n\nEmma Stone normally plays kooky characters of late, so this was perfect opportunity for her to shine in more serious drama which she does adequately. But she got upstaged by both Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer, the former who brought a certain quiet dignity to her role which just calls for respect, and the latter being the comic relief as a really straight-talker, and whose story was probably the most touching in the film, with one of the funniest, running gag in the later half. Bryce Dallas Howard also owned her role as the antagonist Hilly in the film, and if you'd think she's only capable of goody two shoes roles, think again as she can convincingly play back-stabbers, with Sissy Spacek in a supporting role as Hilly's mom.\n\nThe Help reminds us of how one has to have Fear and Courage to addresses changes in community or the larger society we serve in, without which we would all be poorer for it. It may be almost 2 1/2 hours long, but it's every minute worth it just watching how an uphill battle was fought, and baby steps being taken each time to overcome obstacles placed in the characters' way. It's guaranteed that you'll laugh and you'll cry in the film thanks to its material, and it's firmly one of the contenders to be amongst my favourite films of this year. Highly recommended!"

Skeeter also fights against the expectations for her to follow the routine, husband, kids, no job etc. Thanks heavens for people like her.\n\nViola Davis, Octavia Spencer and Emma Stone dazzle the whole way through, their performances are impeccable, no wonder this film is so highly regarded. Stone is prolific, but I still regard this as her finest moment. Jessica Chastain manages to lift the mood a few times as Celia, and break your heart.\n\nThat pie was more about just a personal revenge. That's the best scene in the whole film.\n\nSuperb production values throughout, every single detail is on point, the costumes, sets, houses, cars etc\n\nSkeeter's car, is that the most beautiful motor ever made! Wow.\n\nOne of the best films ever made, 10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "The film begins with Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) giving a brief insight into the lives herself and her community who work, for the most part, as domestic staff for the white elite of Jackson, Mississippi. How she's spent most of her life raising white children and how she'd recently lost her own son. And Minnie, her friend, (played by Octavia Spencer) loses her job due to an inability to abide by unjust rules and hold her tongue as she's expected to.\n\nMeanwhile, Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan (played by Emma Stone) has returned home from college with a degree and plans to use it. An idea that is lost on her friends and family who saw college as a means to an end in their quest for suitable husbands who could support them and their future children in the manner they've become accustomed to thanks to their upbringing. And while Skeeter(Stone) finds a job writing a column about cooking and other matters she has little to no expertise on and a valuable resource for the column in Aibileen (Davis), she soon finds her real passion in chronicling the life, times, and injustices of African American domestic servants in Jackson.\n\nI've heard the criticisms leveled on this film and, in all honesty, they're not wrong. It's depiction of racism is, for the most part watered down or rose-colored. And the film's main antagonist is a twitchy social butterfly whose only real power is her standing. That might make sense if her near-senile mother weren't heckling her in the background during those important social events. It is funny, the characters that are the actual focus of the film are endearing and the conclusion is satisfying enough without being too far-fetched to be believable."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film uses every clich\u00e9 in the book starting with the liberal minded white person who is the voice of conscience and the long suffering good hearted but somewhat simplistic black people.This film is emotionally manipulative and panders to a sentimental reduction of complex history. Its moves were predictable and uses every trick in the book, even the scene in the church is clich\u00e9. Both the white and the black characters are mostly reductive caricatures out of some story book world which doesn't do justice to the historical complexity of such situations. Why would you want to make a saccharine comic book out of profound historical situations-- other than to pander to audiences longing for a feel good experience for the sake of box office. I actually don't mean to disrespect to people who like it, and I don't want to attack the actors. They didn't write the film, but at the same time, I can't believe that so many people fell for this bag of tricks. Still, a bigger problem and disservice a movie like this does to our culture is that such bad history and simplistic human portrayals turns race dynamics into good guy bad guy stories which we can watch with a complacent feeling of how much better we are than those bad old days. Such complacency leads to a historical ignorance that retards honest critique and real progress. This movie would be better if it just didn't pretend to be about something. Let it be some sappy comic book. That wouldn't be the worse thing in the world. At least it would be more honest."

The soundtrack is nothing more than sugarcoating for the overly pretty sceneries and often annoys. Some roughness to the film seems sorely lacking, it almost plays out like a cartoon. Fans of the film should also want to check out the 2007 film 'The Great Debaters' (Denzel Washington, Forrest Whitaker) with a comparable premise which suffers from the same, in my opinion, weaknesses.\n\n6/10"

When she arrives home, she finds that her nanny and family's maid Constantine Jefferson (Cicely Tyson) is gone.\n\nSkeeter sees the chance of writing a book about the relationship of the black maids with the Southern society for an editor from New York. First she convinces Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) to open her heart to her; then Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer) is unfairly fired by the arrogant Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard), who is a leader in the racist high society, and Minny decides to tell her stories after finding a job with the outcast Celia Foote (Jessica Chastain). Soon eleven other maids accept to be interviewed by Skeeter that also tells the truth about Constantine. When the book \"The Help\" is released, Jackson's high society will never be the same.\n\n\"The Help\" is an unforgettable movie about a forgettable time in the history of the United States of America. The engaging story is supported by magnificent performances and the viewer does not feel the 146 minutes running time. The performances of Viola Davis, Bryce Dallas Howard, Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain are top-notch and all of them deserved at least nomination to the Oscar and major film festivals. The direction is tight and art direction is very realistic. My vote is nine.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Hist\u00f3rias Cruzadas\" (\"Entwined Stories\")"

She portrays the ignorant racists as well as Skeeter's endeavour to make the world realise the immorality of the oppression. Emma Stone plays this well, despite bordering patronising a few times. Minny on the other hand manages to find a balance between an eye rolling, finger snapping, sarcastic stereotype and a headstrong, witty character. Aibileen also does this and still manages to keep it genuine as she creates a bond with one of the children she cares for telling her 'you is kind, you is smart, you is important' this was an important relationship in the film because it educates the audience about the emotional bond that developed between maids and those that they cared for.\n\nSkeeter's tell all book provides an opportunity for a power shift from the black staff to their white owners and back and forth, providing a roller coaster of entertainment for the viewer."

They offered to build single toilets outside exactly for hired maids, arguing that colored people have different illnesses than white people and white people could get infected from them.

Some people understood that it's unfair and humiliating towards to the maids. One of them is a girl who didn't want to spend her life like other women and who had in her past a very wise and kind colored nanny who helped her to get confidence and belief in herself. The girl had changed a common order of the things and gave to the colored people hope and helped them to overcome fear to say the truth.\n\nThis truth was exposed in the book \"The help\".

All of the names were changed in the book but every single detail, regardless is a disgusting and humiliating thing, was true and showed real face of each white women.

I spent most of the movie just confused that people could be that hostile and ignorant toward their fellow human beings, but by the end, I saw that bright piece of victory. It's not a happy ending, per s\u00e9, just one that makes you feel like perhaps there's a little hope in the world.

A movie about the civil rights movement in the 1960's responds with a light hearted approach to the chaos whilst conjunctively addressing the hardship of 'The Help'. Whilst the in-story author requires help from the help, to right about the Help may seem disorienting, Tate Taylor (Director) does this in a way that no other Director seems to be able to do correctly. Great camera work located at about 30 minutes, where the camera spirals upwards, following Emma Stone up the spiral staircase is a shot that has been remembered by myself and is something I look for within movies today. However, this shot and the shot at the end credits place it comfortably - in my books, as the shot which is on par with final shot from 'The Passenger'. The end credits in particular allow the actors the right of recognition which they all deserve. Keeping to the underlying message right down to the point. A film which is undeniably rare for our time, a perfect 10 out of 10, 5 out of 5, masterpiece."

The film is touching, but it didn't get me so far, that i would say \"wow, that makes me really cry\" What really annoys me about the film is the Hollywood/American touch of the film. Sorry guys, i have nothing against America, but its a bit not authentic- and i didn't mean the not authentic behaviour of Jackson Ville, what the author/director intended. I mean especially skeeter, who is that innocent and such a perfect girl, without any appeal of racism or other bad characteristics. The whole impact she achieves with her book seems to me quite unauthentic. And for me the facts about the civil war are even a bit whitewashed or sugar coated. They could even draw more attention how bad the situation for the black people really was.\n\nWhat i did like was the combination of martin Luther Kings parts of his speeches and the impact on Jackson ville.\n\nIn conclusion i liked the film, but if you want to see a more realistic and for me more touching film about civil rights, than i would rather watch \"to kill a mockingbird\" from 1962 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056592/?ref_=nv_sr_1"

Like the hidden embarrassment of sexual products on commercial television, this movie seems to have dared to expose the dirty laundry in a balanced drama, lightened with elements of humor.\n\nUnlike The Stepford Wives (2004) that used comedy as its primary platform to expose the dichotomy of the 1950s with todays societal values, The Help in the same way Uncle Tom's Cabin published in 1852 (there were not movies back then) brings to the mainstream audience a serious but balanced and mainstream acceptable version of the racial divide of the 1950s. The Help is a break through movie for our times that oddly enough may or may not hold up in 50 or 100 years unless it becomes memorable for its revelation at least in mainstream movies, the racial blindness of its history America still retained so many years later at the Civil Rights era. Or maybe like Schindler's List (1993), the shocking but revealing World War II drama, The Help may be able to retain its historical value aside from its present day exposure of today's America's subconscious.\n\nThe Help is a deeply revealing, emotional compelling inward look at America and allows mainstream America to become sensitively aware of the thin veneer that remains covering over the racial prejudice that still pervades America today, even as the gains made over the past 30,40 years have been wiped away, especially with the Great Recession and the political atmosphere that has become a backdrop of everyday existence for African Americans and other minorities in this Country."

Unfortunately, it's a much over-simplified version of the story and the people involved. The adaptation to be a much shorter on-screen story is not bad - facts and events are shifted around to basically tell the same essential plot.\n\nOverall, I found it kind of cheesy, especially coming from the *excellent* read version, which goes much deeper.\n\nIf you're coming to the film without reading/listening to the novel, it's probably more enjoyable."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, I grew up during this period in the south and we always had a black maid. We loved our black maid Veronica (first black person I'd ever seen and I thought she was made of my favorite stuff -- chocolate), and our family corresponded with her (and sent her money) for years after we moved. Other families had black maids and no one ever, ever, ever, ever, ever talked about them or treated them the way they are in this film (haven't read the book) but instead with value and respect, though within the confines of the segregationist times. That whole bathroom issue --silly, never happened that I witnessed or heard of.\n\nDon't get me wrong: It was certainly a period and relationship worth examination from our more modern era. I can recall at one point going out to visit our maid who was sick. She lived on a piece of farmland -- had all these children, our counterpart, and we played together while parents visited, though I was aware that it was like looking in a mirror, dark on other side.\n\nAnd one can bemoan the disparity of the period (but we still have it though) and still-rampart racism back then that was just taken for granted by everyone. But, no, ma'am, nothing about this movie rang true beyond the fact that the maids were always black, generally poorer, and, yes, helped raise white babies (sang to them, fed them, fussed at them, did their -- my -- hair). Maybe there was just some peculiar cesspool in Jackson, but if anyone had acted like the villain did where we lived, she'd probably be sent for mental treatment (actually not, but everyone would know she was insane).\n\nAnd by the way, no one back then said \"Damn\" in front of a woman (opening scene), \"Jesus\" as a cuss-word (opening scene), and heaven forbid \"Sh-t\" (many times) which I never once heard in my life until college.\n\nIn summary, this movie struck me as a bit of a cartoon. Plunked down in a real period lifestyle are cartoonish villains as well as cartoonish heroines. Guess you needed to put in such stuff for Hollywood. Or maybe the writer added it to finally get sold. Too bad."

Of course in a book based film there will be some differences, details that get left out. I was thoroughly pleased with this film and how close it came to the book. The things that were changed or left out are understandable. There are a couple of small things I wished the movie stayed true to: Constantine being a large, tall woman, and of course the way that Stuart left Skeeter. Although, I would have been happy if they left out him leaving all together and had him stay with her :) The cast they chose was incredible. I am a huge Emma Stone fan, but I have to say that Hilly's character was my favorite. That beautiful woman played that horrible part so well. And please let me revert back to a teenager for a moment and say that Chris Lowell is a hottie. Last but not least... I saw interviews saying that Aibileen's character was really going to have to work hard to fill the shoes and believe me, SHE DID, but I have to say that Octavia Spencer was outstanding. Minny stole the show. This is an incredible film and I will watch it over and over."

I went through all of the emotions: anger, sadness, happiness...there were plenty of laughs and plenty of tears.\n\nEmma Stone shines brightly as the films headstrong protagonist, Eugenia (Skeeter), who barrels against social injustice through her compilation of the accounts of numerous Black maids in 1960's Jackson, Mississippi into a compelling novel. Emma shows off her range, giving us a both a no-nonsense, determined Skeeter, as well as a softly emotional, tender Skeeter, as we are privy to her inner motivations.\n\nThe casting of this film is impeccable. Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer are wonderful in the roles of Aibileen and Minny, respectively, Viola providing the heart and soul, Octavia the lightheartedness and laughs. Jessica Chastain is a breath of fresh air as the kind, whimsical, somewhat air-headed and misunderstood Celia Foote. And who could forget Bryce Dallas Howard as the villainous Hilly, whom we despise with all our hearts. I could not have chosen a better cast for this film, as all were truly capable of their roles, and brought this film to life.\n\nI give this film 8 of 10 stars, because though it was wonderfully insightful and touching, I felt the pacing was somewhat slow and meandering, though there were a few bursts of high activity. There were also a few cuts from scene to scene that did not flow well. Overall though, I thought this movie was fantastic and I would definitely see it again."

This is an awesome movie everyone should see. Racism is disgusting and should never be. This movie was so good and had such a great message I didn't want it to end. I grew up with racist parents and grandparents and I can tell you I could very well have ended up prejudice but I hated it then and I hate it now. We make choices in life if we are going to do right or wrong and we all bleed red. If people can't get along on earth what makes anyone think God wants them in heaven? This was wonderful how they presented what was still going on in the 60s. I saw the racism and hatred with the watts riots, the tension in Long Beach, and the hatred from both sides. This movie was presented so good and had such great aspects to it that it was the one movie in hundreds I have seen that I would even want to give a review on. Acting great, story great, and even if it was just a presentation of what things went on and might not have been about a particular family...this was pretty darn accurate by what I lived through in the 60s. Thanks for the movie. It was a delight to watch and I give it a triple A rating. All families should watch this together and discuss it after because it truly should win every award out there."

If the filmmakers wanted to be an historically accurate think-piece, they really should not have made the trailers make the movie seem like a comedy. If they wanted it to be a comedy, they shouldn't have included some of the more vicious racial elements. It ended up being a movie that made you laugh at parts and really made you squirm in your seat at other parts but left you feeling like you were robbed of something that could have been really great.\n\nAll that being said, however, it was a pretty good main-stream movie touching on the subject of household help and the racial tensions involved in the nascent Civil Rights era of the 50s and 60s that I haven't seen before. It was interesting to see how these women so bonded with their employer's children and how the children saw their maids as their second (or even \"real\") mothers.\n\nBasically, it was a good movie but don't expect to learn much from it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sitting through \"The Help\" I was immediately entranced by the stellar performances of Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer as Aibileen Clark and Minny Jackson. Both carried the film with exceptional wit, warmth and strength that couldn't have been done by finer actresses. I recommend watching the movie for their performances alone. As the credits rolled and I started my drive home however, I began to reflect on the film and began to find some cracks in its veneer.\n\nThe largest complaint shared by \"The Help's\" critics, myself included is its tone which at times becomes too light and airy. Indeed the filmmakers seem to gloss over showing the true nature of racism or for that matter the true nature of spousal abuse. The inherent graveness of a maid divulging information about their employer in 1960's Mississippi just isn't there, at least not to a realistic level.\n\nThe film also stumbles on its portrayal of many of its white characters. Emma Stone's Skeeter is immediately sympathetic but shows little development or character flaws. Bryce Dallas Howard's Hilly is likewise one note and hollow. Her southern belle act and tactless racism becomes more of a caricature than a real person. It makes me wonder how Skeeter and Hilly could have ever been high school friends.\n\nFor all \"The Help's\" faults however, there is no getting around the stellar performances from its two heroines. The story really is fascinating and the comic set-pieces achieve their goals. In fact I would say the film itself achieved its goals; my argument is they should have aimed higher.\n\nhttp://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a hard film to adequately review, because so much is right with it, yet at the same time so much is wrong. Or if not \"wrong,\" at least there are some major tones that simply did not work for me.\n\nThe cast is spectacular. Emma Stone is not just adorable, but a skilled and marvelous actor. You don't need me to remark that she has a stellar career ahead of her. The rest of the cast includes some of those great character actors you see in the better films, but can't quite remember where you've seen them before. but that's a plus for a character actor, as their appearances, therefore, always seems fresh.\n\nIt feels very awkward for me to mention the tone that felt wrong. The abuse and inhumane treatment endured by black people 50 years ago is hard to watch today. The pain inflicted, and the behavior of the oppressors can only be called an \"evil\" situation. One hopes that evolution has done its work, and social justice prevails today. If not perfectly, then at least to a tolerable degree.\n\nBut that is part of the problem, to me. This film seems to merely recycle old tropes of injustice. It seems to be, as one of my professors used to call it, a \"pot stirrer.\" Lots of agitation and angst and shame and sympathy just for the sake of chaos--- but here it doesn't seem to be authentic. It certainly doesn't seem to go anywhere. It's almost as if the writer has taken an easy issue guaranteed to provoke outrage and anger, rather than doing the authentic, and difficult, artistic work necessary to invoke compassion and healing. This film might be, to be blunt, merely counterfeit social justice. It might be a brazen attempt to \"push buttons\" for undeserved sympathy. I sincerely hope I am mistaken, and overly unkind.\n\nGranted, that's a subtle point. But that's also why I found the theme of the film a bit objectionable- it seemed as if the filmmakers were taking advantage of most people's natural and gut-level decency to elicit an audience response on a tabloid level.\n\nFurther, who would DARE to criticize this film? It's almost as if it were \"criticism proof.\" Therefore unsound dramatic treatments will go by without comment. Given that I think that was done deliberately, even if somewhat unconsciously, this movie takes an honorable and lofty struggle for which many people suffered and even died, and shamelessly exploits that to make a few bucks at the box office. Think about it- what insights or \"new\" themes were introduced here? I'd say none. It may be an example of what Plato called \"pandering,\" going for the cheap points via a stimulus-response fest.\n\nI hope I am wrong- I hope it is really just a matter of me not responding to this particular cinematic venture. If I am even partly right, however, it bodes ill for our modern shallow and thoughtless \"junk media\" environment."

Aibileen Clark is a black maid in 1960s Jackson, Mississippi who puts up with incredible abuse and racism then one day decides to tell her story. With every turn of her head, with every shifted gaze, Davis makes you feel this woman's torment. Her final words, \"Ain't you tired?\", carry an incredible emotional whump. The film is moving, entertaining, funny in places, and also horrifying in parts. It all comes together. See it for the value of the craft, but remember it for Davis's acting masterclass."

My father, being from a Slavic country and having emigrated here after WWII, was an exception as well. Perhaps having been mocked for his accent and being old when I was born he knew how hurtful it is to treat another human being as a second class citizen for being different, even though he was white and Catholic. I was harassed for the religion I was brought up in, rather than being some form of a Protestant. Southern hospitality is a farce because as soon as you walk away from someone who is landed gentry or if they feel you're different and lesser than them in some other way, they are laughing at you and saying the meanest things they can think up. I won't live in this awful place much longer, where they pay less, hate women and the KKK and Rebel Flags still are displayed with pride. The most hateful are the women and the most violent are the men. Of course there are exceptions, but the culture of racism and sexism are still alive 50+ years since the Civil Rights Act was passed. I work in healthcare, and there are even Indian doctors who still believe in the caste system, that the disabled and mentally ill are somehow less entitled to the basic quality of service than \"normal\" people. But that seems to be an American standard across the country these days, especially since the most recent president was elected. There's no changing this country in my lifetime, so it's off to Europe for me.\n\nCongratulations to this cast and crew for presenting a truly realistic story of what the South was and still is like."

        "review_detailed_main": "In 2008,I had a chance to watch a movie that stood on it's strong performances and an excellent adaptation from a Tony Award winning play...........I'm talking of the movie 'Doubt'.The movie had nearly the entire cast nominated for the Oscars that year.One performer was Voila Davis,who had strongly caught my attention for her class performance.She had a screen space of hardly a couple of minutes .....but she exploited those moments completely to show us an authentic portrayal of a concerned mother. This year in The Help,she again manages to move us with her acting potentials.She does the role of a black maid who raises white children.The movie is set against the backdrop of racism, wherein the maids (all colored women) from Jackson come forward to give in their experiences in the houses of the whites where they are employed.And each ones experiences comes together to take in the shape of a book by Anonymous, thanks to Skeeter(Emma Stone.... another notable character in the movie),which turns out to be popular but also a threat to some of the white women who have to face the consequences of their mindset(one hilarious moment being when Mrs.Hilly eats the pie made by Minny........an incredible revenge I say)...oh yeah .........Minny....Octavia Spencer,I should mention has done an outstanding work....one class apart performance......and even Jessica Chastain manages to grab your attention as a dumb white mistress(Ms.Celia Foote) to Minny but she is extremely good at heart(which I believe is more important to call yourself a human being). Viola Davis as Aibileen is not only just impressive but is the real show stealer.The performances of the women are so brilliant that the viewer tends to overlook everything else about the film. But what makes the performances so strong is beautiful adaptation of the screenplay and a good job from the director ........Tate Taylor.....he surely does deserve kudos.What I loved about his work was that he could purely read my mind....I gave it a thought .......is the movie about racism?.......NO..........it is only about the maids who are doing an incredible favor to their mistress.......raising their children.........and in return these women get treated like shits.I adore the way he made this point clear across the film. The movie on a whole has been brilliant.....after a long time I got to see a movie that made me laugh,cry,thrill.......and most importantly made me feel humbled...It is surely one of the best movies of the year!!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The book was a fantastic read and I think the movie did a decent job of bringing it to life. Set in 1960s Mississippi, The Help is about a white girl, Skeeter Phelan, who collaborates with black maids to tell their stories of what it's like to work in a white household. They hope to narrow the racial divide and improve conditions for blacks. Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer put up excellent performances as the maids, Aibileen and Minny. As president of the county's Ladies' League and leader of the racist campaign to build separate toilets for blacks in every household (not to mention Skeeter's friend), Hilly was also just as smooth and poisonous as I had imagined her to be. Emma Stone was alright as Skeeter, but a lot of her inner struggles in the book didn't really come out, so I found it kind of hard to connect with her.\n\nWhile I think the movie was pretty good, its inability to make us think about our behaviour in the present-day context stopped it from being great. I also didn't like how some of the characters' reactions to Skeeter writing the book (Stuart and Skeeter's mother) were made more extreme, as it led to an oversimplification of the situation in that era."

        "review_detailed_main": "Watching \"The Help\" is like living the days of black women back in the days and witnessing the struggle and hardship in almost every aspect of their lives. This is easily one of the best of the year, or at least one of the most touching movies of the year for me.\n\nI should have seen this back in the summer but I ended up with other choices. 2011 has been a good year for movies, especially with a number of blockbusters that are not at all bad (No, I am not talking about Transformers and Green Lantern). Although, there may be some competition at the Academy Awards this year, I still believe that \"The Help\" will get away with some wins which it deserves.\n\nTo start with, it is the stunning performances.\n\nEmma Stone, taking the leading role of Skeeter, has shown the audience that her acting can be much more than \"Easy A\". It is a big step forward and she has definitely given a Oscar-worthy performance. Indeed, she is also essential for the story development because it is basically her concern and passion that drive the later events and keep the surprises coming.\n\nViola Davis from \"Doubt\" is also one of the protagonists. Playing one of the black maids named Aibileen, she portrays the emotions of fear and hope. From a passive character to an active help to Stone (Skeeter), her performance is incredible and totally realistic. And of course, having been a Oscar nominee once, this time her even better performance absolutely deserves recognition from the Academy once again.\n\nThen we have Octavia Spencer who has the role of Minny, also a maid. The performance is again Oscar-worthy. Her \"tougher\" appearance and personality are what make her stand out and have a different attitude. But indeed, the bottom line is Minny and Aibileen are united by an opportunity to change, to let their voices be heard.\n\nLast but not least, we have Howard. I would be surprised if she is not nominated at Oscars this year, after her amazing performances in \"The Tree of Life\", this, and \"Take Shelter\". As a housewife who has Octavia (Minny) as her maid, her character is the \"boss\" of the housewives. The scenes when she bursts into rage are superb.\n\nOther performances are also good in \"The Help\", but I guess the above four are the ones that I find outstanding. If the Academy recognizes this film, I believe there is a high chance that at least two nominations of Supporting Actress will be from this, and it will be hard to pick one for sure.\n\n\"Change begins with a whisper\". That is the kind of story \"The Help\" wants to tell. As the movie approaches the end, there is a great number of touching scenes that can make you cry. And throughout the movie, there are scenes that can make you laugh, hard.\n\n\"The Living Proof\", as a soundtrack played at the end of the movie when the closing credits roll in, is an extraordinary song. It is beautiful music, and its lyrics and meanings fit the theme of the movie perfectly. There are also other great songs played, also near the finish of the movie. Again, \"The Help\" should also be a great competitor in the category of Best Original Song at Oscars.\n\n\"The Help\" is a combination of astonishing performances by a number of great actresses and a well-written story which I guess most viewers and the Academy will like."

Although the movie does give its viewers a good idea of some civil rights issues during the 60s, I think that the dramatization takes away from the history of the era. It's more of a drama about relationships, than a historical film. The movie revolves around Skeeter, a white journalist, searching for black maids who are willing to share their stories with her. I thought it was interesting to learn about the crucial role that the maids played in the families that they worked for. They practically raised the children, and yet they were treated horribly and received very little pay. Despite my interest in the maids' stories, the \"white savior\" aspect of the movie bothered me. Skeeter rescued the maids, and in the end she advanced in her career as a journalist when she earned her dream job. Although it is powerful and interesting, I think that the movie is a bad representation of important history."

The light, fluffy, glossy look and woeful acting (from a good female ensemble cast) strips away the suffering and hardship reducing the feeling for the characters (which should be it's focus). Instead of staying truly serious to the subject matter this is flipped into an ugly light-hearted entertainment journey (trying to create the Helps versus the nasty white housewives).\n\nThe film was interesting but limited, with most of the second half giggling and obsessed with a 'poo pie' and failed to show the 'Help's' as anything other than minimally reluctant nannies (not slaves).\n\nI would wash away my small memories of this film, in a way that would sum up this forgettable, washy, disappointment of a film. I think too much fun was had, and ultimately was the focus, of a Mississippi history lesson that never took off. 'To Kill A Mocking bird' this most definitely isn't!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a movie about shallow cruel women living in the 1960s in Mississippi and their black maids. Cicely Tyson, Mary Steenburgen, Sissy Spacek, Leslie Jordan (Bernard from Boston Legal) and Allison Janney all have minor but juicy roles. Tyson is like watching an alien. Your eyes are glued.\n\nThe cruelty is about putting others down with a big smile, patronising, and shunning. The main villain is Hilly Holbrook played by Bryce Dallas Howard (a supercilious female). I ached for revenge. Some revenge came in the middle of the movie, but there was no grand finale of revenge the way you would expect from Hollywood. She just plodded on and on being her bitchy, self-absorbed self.\n\nThe scene that hit me most emotionally was when a maid was fired without cause, and she went into the child's room she had been caring for and touched each mark on the wall where she had recorded the child's height over the years.\n\nOne of the most interesting characters was Celia Foote played by Jessica Chastain. We are introduced to her as a skinny Marilyn Monroe clone air head bimbo who has not the ability to even boil water. Gradually she becomes a more tragic character, even though she remains an air head bimbo. The townspeople are unbelievable rude to her. Her maid gradually teaches her to cook and to have some self confidence. The message is she too has a right to happiness and respect even if she is stupid. The others are jealous because she landed the handsomest and richest guy in town. It is a beautiful movie because you stay sympathetic to her even when she continues to get drunk and barf at a fancy dress ball.\n\nOne strange feature of the movie is it had it happy ending about 3/4 the way through, then they just kept tacking on denouement after denouement like some spoof symphony that could not get on with ending."

        "review_detailed_main": "For about two-thirds of the film, the overall atmosphere really reminded me of the stories my grandfather told me about his life in Germany and his fathers life in Russia before that. It feels like the black people lived in a totalitarian state, a police state. And of course it really was like that. This is what it must have been like, in Apartheid South Africa.\n\nSo, the real value of this film is that you realize that much has has stayed the same and worse, that America is changing back, in a way. Of course it's a little better now. In the 1960s, blacks couldn't protest and didn't kill whites who slaughtered their fathers, mothers, daughters or sons, because they knew that the retaliation would be against ALL black people, not just the ones who fought back. See Israels methods against Palestinians, they blow up the house of the whole family of a \"terrorist\".\n\nBut given the current political climate, it's not a stretch to say that things aren't improving. Blacks are STILL the bottom of the rung, despite all the ones who 'made it'. Unless blacks are 14% of all professions, especially the ones that create wealth like upper middle class businesspeople, and the proverbial doctors and lawyers, things aren't resolved.\n\nThis film does indicate that African-Americans in Hollywood STILL aren't fully equal. How many major Hollywood films have you ever seen with a true black female lead? Especially ones where she doesn't play a 'black' character? I guess those movies aren't really there.\n\nI first saw Viola Davis in an episode of Law and Order Criminal Intent, where she was the though mastermind bad cop. Ever since, she just played 'black', or 'token black'. Sad.\n\nThe latter third is a feel good movie. It's understandable why, it's hard to accurately portray the bleakness of those years, especially for a white writer. You can see the denial of harshness of those years right here on these pages and in other reviews. There's complaints that they can't be critical about this, in other words, the film is a race card that's been played. Complaining about the race card is a deceptive and slightly more subtle form of racism, but it's racism nonetheless.\n\nThis country is not yet ready for a true portrait of slavery, or of Jim Crow times.\n\nThe Melancholic Alcoholic."

When I read Kathryn Stockett's book I thought that its description of an all-female world would thwart its straightforward conversion into a screenplay. I was mistaken. In fact, the males in the book were still slightly more prominent, especially Minnie's abusive husband Leroy. In the film, he is never seen at all, although to some extent he remains a menacing presence. And the senator in the book, an old Southerner who to the dismay of some of his guests suggests that the days of Jim Crow are over, is completely omitted.\n\nLeroy's absence obviously softens the film. Same goes for the rewriting of the character of Mrs. Phelan; her \"conversion\" to post-segregation mores makes her more likable for today's audiences (Klansmen apart). These changes turn the film into a typical feel-good movie. I think it will stand the test of time, both in itself and as a adaptation of a novel; whether critics will come to like it one day is a different matter.\n\nOn a different note, if you are a foreign speaker and naturalized Midwesterner, you will have some trouble understanding the black slang and even the speech of some of the white characters."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have to divide my review of The Help, a highly effective, award-winning sentimental drama about loving black maids and their oppressive female employers in the American south during the Civil Rights era of the 1960s, into two parts. On the one side, this is a truly moving and well-told account about people whose stories should be heard (I haven't read the book upon which the film is based, and neither have I any relevant firsthand knowledge, so I cannot assess the validity of said stories). There is doubtlessly many universal truths in this portrait, and the time and place in question (Jackson, Mississippi) is so vividly and engagingly brought back to life that we feel we're practically living these people's lives. Writer/director Tate Taylor, himself a native of Jackson, Mississippi, demonstrates not only his close affiliation with the subject matter, but also that he is a masterful and cunning storyteller.\n\nOn the other hand, Taylor has no shame in playing to our emotions through simplified characterizations and stereotypes. He combines his intelligent scrutiny on serious, relevant issues with cheap, TV-style melodramatic effects such as one-dimensional good/bad guys and a blatant omission of potentially more complex discussions. In the role of the main antagonist, for example, Bryce Dallas Howard seems to be afraid to confront her character's flaws seriously, and so she makes her into a caricature - obviously with Taylor's endorsement, if not he would have directed her otherwise. Similarly, Howard's other antagonistic companions are being presented as dumb, undiversified Stepford Wives. At the other end of the scale, Emma Stone's character Skeeter comes off more as a modern woman who has time-travelled back to a world order she doesn't approve of rather than someone who goes against the current out of courage. If she isn't an anachronism, then I've probably never seen one. And as if that isn't enough, Taylor's view of the maids is glossed and rosy-red; they seem to have more love, goodness and pedagogic knowledge to give their oppressors' children than any mother I've ever met seem to have had for their own. If only all children in the world were raised by Aibileens and Minnys, there would probably be no more war.\n\nAnd so to the conclusion. To put it simple, The Help is a good film gone bad. Or perhaps a bad film made good. In any case, it is contrived - something you might not notice if you're blinded by Taylor's gifts as a storyteller (which is not something to be ashamed of; he is really good), but which becomes quite apparent with some afterthought. No wonder Hollywood likes this film though; it's pretty, kind-hearted and tackles a controversial subject material which is rendered harmless by a fitting temporal distance. Clever, but not necessarily as noble as it might seem."

        "review_detailed_main": "In the opening weekend, The Help sat at number 2 in the box office, the next three weekends after that it sat at number 1. I saw it this last weekend and it ended as number 2 again.\n\nBased on a book of the same name, The Help follows the lives of African- American maids in the South during the 1960s. Issues like racism and civil rights are obviously apparent here.\n\nThe film has grossed over $141 million with a budget of only $25 million. Quite a theatrical film feat if ya ask me.\n\nThe main focus of the story is obviously on \"The Help\" book and the character that wrote it. Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan, portrayed so elegantly by Emma Stone, is the author of said book. After coming back home from graduating at University of Mississippi, she finds that her childhood maid, Constantine, had quit. To Skeeter this doesn't add up as her maid was beloved.\n\nSeeing Emma Stone in such a serious drama like this one gave her a lot more respect. I've only known Emma as a comedic girly actor in films like Superbad, Zombieland, Easy A, and Crazy, Stupid, Love. Aforementioned comedies like those didn't present her true acting potential. This has to be Emma's best acting so far! I thought her popularity was over exaggerated this year, but I was wrong. It'll be interesting to see how she plays Gwen Stacy in The Amazing Spider-Man.\n\nOther honorable mentions would have to be Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer, who played the two main maid characters in Aibileen Clark and Minny Jackson. The two combined presented most of the dramatic and comedic aspects of the film. I really enjoyed their performance. Truly were devoted to their characters. Well done!\n\nEverything about this movie was well done. The acting was great all around, the sets were visually appealing, the music flowed, the direction was there, and the story was great. It's hard to pick out something bad.\n\n9/10 Stars."

But that's not the point and if I had to rate this idiosyncratically, it is a good film.\n\nThe cast is outstanding... I mean this could just be the film with the cast who are totally into their respective characters of the book. I loved Bryce Dallas Howard & Octavia Specner, but who really stood out with her portrayal is Jessica Chasatin (I have watched Mama & ZD30, but this is just too impressive of her). Fantastic! And the music is great, too. What troubled me is the screenplay and when it skipped elements like it had a time constraint it felt bad. But I understand how the editor might have had terrible nights editing it into reason. The costumes are fine and my appreciation to the art crew.\n\nTate Tylor had no reason to adapt the sensational book, but since it has been I'd give it a one-time watch. And the minor changes I mentioned before actually work for the movie. And let me take this opportunity to ask all the people to read the book so that you LOL & produce ire at the same time about the much-discussed topic. It is one of the most enjoyable books I've read.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: It was real treat to watch the words of the book go real on reel and I am happy the cast was able. Recommended for people who haven't read the book. For others, read it first and skip the film.\n\nCan be watched with a typical Indian family? YES\n\nprofanity/Vulgarity: Mild | Sex/Nudity/Foreplay: No | Mouth-Kiss: Mild | Violence/Gore: No | Smoking/Alcohol: Strong"

In it every character is a clich\u00e9 cartoon in support of a fictional rose coloured glasses version of 60's America, where almost every white person is a villain and every black person loves fried chicken. If this is how America learns its history (and judging by the reviews where many have viewed this film as having a positive and accurate message of hope and struggle????), then no wonder the western world is in trouble. Is it worse that a story about the struggle of black people to overcome oppression in racist 60s America is centered on a privileged white woman on the road to New York success? Marginalized yet again it seems. This movie started out as passable entertainment but by the time it crossed the finished line it had stepped full force into misguided and offensive. And shockingly many people seem to not know the difference."

        "review_detailed_main": "At the outset, I have to say that I have not read the novel by Kathyrn Stockett. Written for the screen and directed by her good friend Tate Taylor, The Help is one of the must see movies of the year.Strung together on a modest budget of 35 million, it has become one of the sleeper hits of the year with a domestic gross of over 160 million and still counting. Set in the background of 1960's civil rights struggle in America led by Martin Luther King, The Help focuses on the plight of African American housekeeper community and struggles against their racist white employers in suburban conservative Jackson,Mississippi. With an all star outstanding cast, it tells the story of a single independent white woman (Emma Stone) and her dogged pursuit to bring to light the plight of black cleaning maid community. When two of the help of the conservative households in Jackson come forward to tell their story, the struggles threads a thin line between fight for survival and a better future and fear of death from the dreaded and bigoted Ku Klux Klan. Portrayed brilliantly by Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer, the desperation and fear of the marginalised and oppressed Black community comes to fore with outstanding performances which is a sure bet for supporting actress nominations for both the actresses. The ensemble cast includes Bryce Dallas Howard, Jessica Chastain, Chris Lowell,Alison Janney and veteran actresses Sissy Spacek and Cicely Tyson .The performance of Cicely Tyson is one of the most the emotionally poignant scenes of the movie and though she has a screen time of just under two and half minutes, her performance is bound to make you reach for the tissues.The Help is a movie which will highlight how bad it was in the 1960's and how far we have come albeit with a long way to go to still achieve equality for all marginalised communities.The movie will make u get angry, frustrated, it will make u cry, and feel for the desperation of the maids and still manages to have its feel good moments.It is by far the best drama yet this year."

An aspiring author played by pretty Emma Stone during the civil rights movement of the 1960s decides to write a book detailing the African-American maids' point of view on the white families for which they work, and the hardships they go through on a daily basis. Subject is sensitive but treatment is not. In fact most of the time it is balanced, comical take on the racism that makes it an easy watch rather a shocking watch. If we talk about performances, Octavia Spencer treats big time with her delightful portrayal of Minny Jackson for which she was awarded an Oscar. Viola Davis also stands tall with her sincere portrayal of Aibileen Clark. Whole movie is crafted like a girl's movie so there is very less for male actors to show-off here. Movie makes its point but never hits you hard so you may not think much about what you experienced after end credits have gone down. Nevertheless, it's nicely crafted easy watch."

Added with comedy and lots of delicious fried chicken memories from Minny, The Help is a wonderful film. With Aibileen's quiet strength, Minny's strong sass, and Skeeter's stubbornness and determination, these three make a difference that make a big change in the human race forever. I rate this a 10 for a million good reasons. Watch this, or you'll regret it."

        "review_detailed_main": "I wasn't expecting too much from 'The Help', 'cause I dislike most of the Oscars Best Picture nominees from 2011, but I was pleasantly surprised when I finished to watch The Help. It isn't s film with great depth, and it really isn't an accurate depiction of a gritty ambient full of racial tensions; but the story itself has good intentions and succeeds in developing so many characters that it alone makes it deserving of my praise. And the acting was very good, I mean, everyone did a good job. Emma Stone, Bryce Dallas-Howard and in a high level Viola Davis and Jessica Chainstain. I consider Spencer performance to be a bit overrated since she wasn't even the best supporting actress on the film. Davis was great,forced but she showed great range.\n\nI liked the art direction too, very pleasant and eye-candy. And while I disliked the exaggerated vilification of Howard's character, the film showed a somewhat Spielberg-esque style:A drama that never takes itself too seriously. Sometimes it works , and that was the case of The Help. Maybe because the story is very sad and dark after all, so the moments more 'up' are needed to not scare the 'mainstrean' audience. I think if the film had used the real ambient whose the book it was based on was set, the critics would probably love it and admire it's guts and the realism. But since it choose to be a 'lighter' version of the events, it wasn't well received. Well, I personally liked it for what it is. A great mosaic of well developed characters whose connections are the friendship and the racism. A harsh time. Being said, I recommend this film. 7.5/10"

This reminds me of one of those old blaxploitation films gone \"chick\" flick, or maybe a second rate version of \"Steel Magnolias\" with a Jim Crow law plot thrown in. The main problem I have with \"The Help\" is that it lacks the courage it needs to tackle these race relation issues.\n\nThe movie actually starts off well and sets to be a tragic telling with some historical value. However in trying to appeal to everyone it randomly ends up just falling into 30 minutes of comedic jesting out of nowhere and then manipulative \"tear-jerking\" scenes just for the sake of them. In all this desperation to try to appeal to anyone the story ends up being useless drivel and all the characters fall into stereotypical categories. The movie's one saving grace is that each of the actors in this show exemplary ability. Too bad it was all just to turn into Hollywood nonsense.\n\n\"The Help\" is based off a book, which was written by a White lady, through the point-of-view of a Black maid. Ignore all of the novel writer Kathryn Stockett's, high school creative classroom flaws, just admire the nostalgia of the days of the segregated South. If the writing didn't have you rolling your eyes from all of these ridiculously naive concepts and glibness, just know that racial problems can always be solved with fried chicken\u0085 \"The Help\" may actually seem decent to some of the popcorn flick goers who are easily manipulated. Don't be fooled, by the making light of a serious historical dilemma and trying to instead romanticize the time. Don't accept the malarkey marketing trying to pass this off as uplifting. What we need is a real movie thought over and that offers women empowerment, all this movie is sadly, is a crock. 3/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "An inspirational drama, The Help (a deft adaptation of Kathryn Stockett's best-selling novel) is a rousing film with an endearing heart and subtle poignancy that is sometimes overlooked, but once discovered is a certain crowd-pleaser.\n\nSet in Jackson, Mississippi at the dawn of the Civil Rights movement, Emma Stone plays the plucky, fresh-out-of-college Skeeter, who is just plain enough to stand out in her clique of well-to-do white housewives who, beneath their frivolous goings on, treat their black house- helps like slaves. Aggrieved at the racial bigotry she witnesses, and determined to break into the New York literary world, she resolves to write a book that will allow the town's black maids to give a voice to their experiences. Her idea is met with lucrative publishing prospects, but finding any maid willing to give her the real story is a problem. Viola Davis plays Aibileen Clark, who carries a sorrow that is only partly built from a lifetime of servitude. She has lost her own child to racial prejudice and is faced with the growing horrors of racism every single day at work. Then there is her feisty, too-sassy-to-suffer-forever friend Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer) who undergoes similar humiliation at the hands of the meticulously- coiffed society princess Miss Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard). Although with some trepidation, the two finally open up to Skeeter and once they do, the other maids join in and stories begin flowing. Soon, through clandestine meetings, they manage to start something that becomes a force of real change!\n\nThe Help paints its characters, black and white alike, with a very broad bush that adroitly pushes the audience's buttons to elicit laughter and tears. On the surface, The Help might seem like another discourse on the evils of racism. But look closer and you will find that it is a much more complex tale. While the story takes place at a time of seismic social upheaval, racism is just a sidelight in a story that centers on the commonalities that the women faced in the repressive air that filled the early 1960s. In Tate Taylor's hands, a storyline that could have been mushy and preachy becomes genuinely stirring. He succeeds in creating characters you really care about and delivers its message without resorting to sickly sweet sentimentality or becoming too self-congratulatory.\n\nAnd then there are the charming performances that give the story such heart. Taylor expertly juggles all the characters and their stories, providing each actress a chance to stand out in a flock of fascinating women. Stone has an innate likability and is sparkling as Skeeter. Howard embodies the hissable Hilly with a vibrant panache. Jessica Chastain delivers the wonderfully tacky, white- trash Celia with flair, giving her pathos and earnestness. Both Allison Janney and Sissy Spacek are faultless in their maternal turns. But it's Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer who breathe life into the movie in their career defining performances. Davis gives Aibileen an elusive truth that jumps off the screen and delivers a perfectly nuanced performance (her hypnotic gaze alone could carry a film). Spencer plays a wonderfully cheeky Minny, offering plenty of comic relief, and a respectable honesty to her sass.\n\nThe Help picks its audience up and carries it along in its engrossing, affecting wake: and then, like the best nursemaids, it calms us down with a large spoonful of healing syrup. The Help not only has its 'pie' but eats it too (Pun intended. Be assured, you'll never look at chocolate pie the same way again)!"

Neglected by a mother who finds her too chubby and cumbersome, and a constantly absent father, Abileen is the only caring adult in the girl's life, the one who's there for her through real and metaphorical storms.\n\nBased on the bestseller by the same name written by Kathryn Stocket in 2009, the movie version of The Help, directed by Tate Taylor, tells the story of the young aspiring writer Eugenia (nicknamed Skeeter and played by Emma Stone). Skeeter is different from Elizabeth (Ahna O'Reilly), Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) and her other friends who spend their time playing bridge, organising charity events and being snooty. Instead of trying to find a husband, Skeeter's focusing on her career. She also believes that black domestic workers shouldn't be treated as subhumans; a radical view stemming from her relationship with her old nanny Constantine (Cicely Tyson), who raised Skeeter before disappearing without a trace.\n\nAfter landing a job answering housekeeping questions for a newspaper column, Skeeter, who knows nothing about housework, asks Elizabeth to let her domestic worker Abileen help her. After a short time in Abileen's company, Skeeter realises that life as a black domestic worker isn't all rosy, and the idea is born to collect the stories of all the invisible hardworking black women surrounding her and her friends and write a book. Initially reluctant Abileen eventually succumbs and convinces her friend Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer), an outspoken lady who has just been fired by Hilly to help Skeeter realize her dream. As the film progresses the audience is treated to various displays of racist stuck up behaviour, bad parenting, loyalty and silent resistance. \"This isn't about me. It doesn't matter what I feel\", Skeeter promises early in the film which turns out to be mainly about her, Elizabeth, Hilly and the ostracized housewife Celia (Jessica Chastain).\n\nAs New York Press' reviewer Armond White points out the main aim of the film is to entertain, which might explain the lack of engagement with the subject matter at a level that considers the changes that have influenced discussions about race, gender and power in America since the sixties. The approach makes for a dated film that requires the audience to ignore the most important change; that black American women no longer rely on white spokespersons to voice their concerns. Abileen's, Minny's and Constantin's primary function in The Help, a film that does little to challenge traditional racial power dynamics, and translates black agency into steeling and black pride into frying chicken, is simply to help us distinguish good whites from bad, coward and victim whites. The Help is a film that suffers badly from a shallow treatment of a complex subject matter and blatant slapsticky stereotyping (incl. Minny delivering one Chappellesque line about chicken after the other, among them \"Frying chicken just makes me feel better about life. I just love me some fried chicken\").\n\nThe ethos of the film is that of Skeeter; quite radical in the 1960s, less so in 2011. Black underprivileged women playing second fiddle to their white counterparts isn't the problem. It's just a pity that the white women, having forgotten how much they loved their black nannies as children, let the black help raise their children but not use their bathrooms. For someone in tune with this ethos it makes sense that Skeeter is the one who contributes with ambition and skills, and her informants (even if they, like Abileen, also are aspiring writers) with sensational stories about daily humiliation to be turned into literature by Skeeter. To assume, as Skeeter does when finding out what happened to her nanny, that the old woman, who at least until the day she disappeared had a brave and caring daughter by her side (LaChanze), wouldn't survive another minute without Skeeter isn't outrageous given the logical framework of the film, and similarly there's nothing strange about Skeeter's narcissistic reluctance to leave the thirty something informants in the racist town for an attractive job in New York. A concern that reminds me of a that of the man who approaches a group of girlfriends in a bar, asking them what they're doing there all alone.\n\nDifferent approaches at different times; that's how to make any story relevant at any time. Nothing illustrates this better than the example of The Stepford Wives, the 1974 novel by Ira Levin which was adapted to the big screen in 1975 and 2004, and to TV in 1980, 1987 and 1996. Also dealing with oppressive and reactionary ideals, each version of the original story reflects the time in which it was made, with hypnosis being the tool of domination in the 1980 version, role reversal in 1996, and a woman being the master brain running the show in the 2004 version in which the women have become sex- and cash machines. In response to Taylor's dealing with The Help, nothing feels more appropriate than to conclude in the same non-innovative and slightly offensive manner that characterizes his take on the story:\n\nYou is patronising. You is irrelevant. You is out of touch. (This and other movie reviews to be found on the blog \"In the Words of Katarina\")"

        "review_detailed_main": "let me start with telling how much i enjoyed the book, it was funny, informative, and touching. Just like the movie. Tate Taylor did a very good job in both directing and the screenplay. Emma Stone was a good choice, and of course the Oscar nominated Voila Davis did a spectacular job. Davis is a great actress, no one could argue with that. To my surprise, Jessica Chastain and Octavia Spencer performed amazingly. Chastain really showed us in this movie that she is versatile, she was able to make us sympathize with her as a vulnerable wife in \"The Tree of Life\" opposite Brad Pit, in this movie she showed us she can also play the sexy, southern, naive wife. Also, to my surprise, Spencer shocked me that she can combine both good acting and being funny, it will be after this movie that Octavia Spencer will be in movies that could show us more of her talent. Watch out for the Oscars, some of the ladies in this movie \"may\" be competing against each other at Academy Awards in 2012."

Compassion, outrage, humiliation felt for the oppressed..., a mind-boggling experience that everybody should undergo and that, at the end of the viewing, one will come out of it with an expanded view, with a kinder comprehension about oppressed minorities.\n\nThe acting is magnificent, beyond all eulogies, the solid craft --perfect script and impressive acting techniques-- employed in delineating every single character, principal or secondary is something to be seen to believe it.\n\nThe recreation of the 1960s is outstanding, in every respect: colors, fashions, cars, props, the hyper feminine way women displayed at that time, shrieking and giggling like stupid Barbie dolls, the macho men all tied up in knots, and the terrible, awful, taken for granted routine of everyday living with... slaves.\n\nBlack slaves, people suffering every moment of their lives the constant fear and humiliation of being exploited by white people and worse of all, being resigned to that condition. I think this movie should be required viewing in schools, not only in the USA, but all over the world.\n\nI couldn't find any flaws whatsoever in this admirable production, technical or otherwise. A perfect movie in every sense, extraordinary actors, superb director."

I expected something a little less serious, but if the movie was in any way different than it is, it wouldn't be this good. The story is extremely difficult emotionally. It deals with a problem that was an issue not so long ago, and I believe that is what makes it so powerful. People who took care of their children, them, their entire lives were treated, by them, like slaves. No respect, no consideration for their feelings, their problems. I was actually considering leaving the cinema after 40 min because I got so enraged by how those women were treated I could barely stand it. Why was that so? Primarily, the acting. Every character in this movie was played to the point of perfection. Bryce Dallas Howard and Viola Davis were astonishing. One can feel nothing but hate for Hilly, and nothing but sorrow and love for Aibileen. Another staggering performance was the one by Jessica Chastain. I found myself wanting to jump into the movie and just hug that woman's character through and through. Such cuteness I have never seen! The only minor problem is Emma Stone who got a little lost in the sea of these marvelous performances. All of the above named characters simply \"ate\" her on the screen. One more name worth mentioning is Octavia Spencer. She was my favorite character. Strong and powerful, but also extremely gentle and frightened. As is presented, the movie's leading characters are women. Another thing that deserves an absolute A+ is the contrast of the exterior space and the interior of the people. The hairspray generation, the houses filled with thousand of colors and at the same time such dark and evil personalities. See this movie and take everyone you know to see it. It is powerful, staggering, at times hilarious, and it has a beautiful message. This movie will bring out the best of you, and surely bring out emotions."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's the 1960s in Mississippi, and the uppity, high-class, rich white girls have returned from university with husbands in tow and babies in their bellies, and now they get to hire maids of their own. The maids of course are poor black women from the other side of the tracks (literally). Skeeter (Emma Stone), on the other hand, has returned home from university with a degree in hand, rather than a husband, and after a stop-off in New York City in a failed attempt to get a job as a writer.\n\nThe other girls are 1960s Barbie dolls in their party dresses and perfectly coiffed hair. While Skeeter misses the maid who raised her and finds herself drawn to the world of the help as she struggles with her first job. She first gets the advice of two experienced maids working for her Barbie doll friends \u2014 Aibileen (Viola Davis) and Minny (Octavia Spencer) \u2014 for a cleaning column, but she wants to start pushing the boundaries of the law and tell a story from their point of view.\n\nAt its worst, \"The Help\" is a melodramatic but poignant, long drawn-out affair where a white woman happily solves racism in America and the whole world can hold hands and skip in perfect harmony. However, at its best, it's a well-crafted film that subtly holds together multiple genres as it balances that tight rope between drama and comedy. Lean too far in either direction, and you fall (which it comes close to multiple times but never actually crashes).\n\nA hidden story in this movie, is one of a girl, Skeeter, who has triumphantly navigated university, but is at a stand-still in trying to get a job and live independently, so for now, she's at home and working for the local newspaper as she forges her way in the real world. Sounds typical, doesn't it? Except there's a good chance you won't even notice this story because it is hidden beneath all the class-divides, racial-divides and friendship-divides.\n\nThere's even a character in here who will surprise you: Celia Foote played by Jessica Chastain. Although I generally know better than to listen to plastic, talking Barbies who described Celia as white trash, I still believed them. The layers of her cluelessness and my surprise were delightful and entertaining to unravel.\n\nIt's dramatic because this is a story of inequality. The help get treated is if they are \"less than\" while the southern belles act as if they are \"more than.\" As said before Skeeter wants this to be about the maids' point of view, and as you can guess, they are mostly sad stories. Except for Minny's because she likes being bold. Octavia Spencer and Sissy Spacek as the mother of a mean-spirited Barbie doll are responsible for most of the comedic relief. And relief it is because they are funny.\n\nThere were references to Martin Luther King, Jr., John F. Kennedy, \"Gone with the Wind\" and Margaret Mitchell. Because this is Hollywood and the excessive run time, I'm afraid they have already placed this movie in that esteemed group. It's good, it's fun and meaningful, but let's not get too carried away."

And yes, the actors deliver fine performances\u2014Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Jessica Chastain, Emma Stone, and Allison Janney are outstanding, as is Bryce Dallas Howard, who plays the delightfully detestable antagonist (probably the best role of her career\u2014certainly better than anything she did in that \"Twilight: Eclipse\" nonsense). But something about this film just lay flat. The moments that were meant to stir up emotions failed to do so, the plot just kind of meandered with no real suspense or uncertainty, and a main plot device (one of the black maids extracts revenge on a racist former employer by baking a pie that contains a decidedly unsavory and rather putrid ingredient and savoring the racist's enjoyment of it) is almost vulgarly offensive enough to distract the viewer's attention from the alleged moral indignation he/she is meant to feel for the unjust treatment the maid has received. Ultimately, the film is a disappointment, despite the strong performances of its cast, and I'll be thoroughly perplexed if it wins any Oscars at all."

The acting of all main characters was solid, with my favorites being Minnie Aibeleen and Mrs. Walters. It is an entertaining movie to watch, but it does not measure up to the book.

The picture proves definitely up to the novel, that same entertaining and sensitive touch is evident from the first shots, and it's very easy to be drawn into the story and the characters.\n\nCertainly, \"The help\", both the novel and the movie, does not have the sharp and dramatic edge of \"The long walk home\", and although truly committed while representing the condition of black maids working for white families during the 60's, some light is shed, in a way that racism and intolerance are to be counterbalanced by the idea that something could really change. Focus in on the womens' relationship, and also the contrast white-black is explored from a female point of view, around the themes of motherhood and the role of women in Southern society, inside a story where the male point of view is almost absent.\n\nThe movie is wonderfully acted, once having read the novel, I could not have thought of better interpreters, Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer and Emma Stone are exactly how I had devised Aibileen, Minnie, and Skeeter in my mind. It is as if the story and the characters I had devised in my mind while reading the book, were visually developing through the picture. Also the characters of Celia, Hilly and Skeeters's mother help compose a great female cast, and make the movie truly enjoyable from beginning till end. In the end, a movie definitely worth watching, in the same way as the book was worth reading."

        "review_detailed_main": "Knowing that \"The Help\" talks about the race issue in the US, and it usually is the kind of theme qualified as strong contender in the Oscars, plus having quite good reviews, I went to watch with high expectation. And it turned out that it really was a great movie. It delivers a truly strong message.\n\nI have to shamefully say that I was really not aware that the 'colour' issue was so serious back then. I knew there was racist issues, but only after watching the movie that I know it was serious racist issues. And even more surprised that it was just in the 1960s, more recent than I imagined. Well due to I was only born in the late 80s and such a shame that I have little knowledge about the earlier happenings. (By the way I really do not understand why Blacks are labeled as 'colour', I thought White is a colour too, I remember having it in my box of colour pencils)\n\nPeople always say the later generations are luckier as everything just happens to be so much better and easier now, and we did not need to deal with the difficult situations that the older generations used to deal with. Which I think is true, maybe we are really lucky.\n\nBeing personally born and raised in a multi-racial country myself, I know that my country has had a race riot too (also in the 1960s). So I am really lucky to say that now things have turned out to be better and people live a more harmonious life. People from different races are more united now.\n\nBut also growing up in a multi-racial society myself, I know that achieving racial harmony is actually not an easy task. Although we do mix around with people of different race, but usually it is only minor interaction. It is still not easy to spot a whole group consisting different races. But I am also glad that things are improving, which is how it should be. We as humans should always improve, not just the technology that improves.\n\nThe actors and actresses delivered a really strong performance in the movie. No doubt that this is a strong candidate for next year's Oscar nomination, especially I think it deserves nomination in Best Leading Actress and Best Supporting Actress (Viola Davis as Aibileen Clark and Octavia Spencer as Minny Jackson). And not to be overlooked is Jessica Chastain which I think once again delivers after noticing her from \"The Tree of Life\". And this time proves that she can be a versatile actress.\n\nSo this movie should really be a reminder to us that as a modern human being, there really shouldn't be any more racial issues. Yes it had happened before but it was the past and we now have to learn to be a better human. And anyone with a brain and heart should know that there should not be anything that separate us humans as we all live on the same planet. And no one chose to be born as any race, so we should all have the same rights.\n\nAnd I really do not think that there should be any colour labels anyway, as no one is born blue or red or green or silver or gold, we are only either fairer or darker.\n\n*Do feel free to visit my movie blog http://joethemovieblogger.blogspot.com/ for other movie reviews too.

They consistently deleted powerful scenes from the book that underscored the pervasiveness of the racism of the era. What they deleted illustrated so much more powerfully the quiet courage of the protagonists of this fabulous story. I won't go into detail about what they cut so I won't reveal the plot variations, but the consistency with which they sliced and diced shows a pre- determined decision to make the movie \"sweeter\" and more upbeat. But this decision made the choices of the characters seem \"safer\" and their decisions therefore less significant. It's too bad, because the film is beautifully acted and filmed."

        "review_detailed_main": "My wife had recently read the source novel and was most keen to see this movie adaptation, plus I have a keen interest in the US Civil Rights movement and was likewise keen to see it. Perhaps it helps to be an American to appreciate some of the nuances a bit better, but I basically found this a sentimentalised and overly patronising story, with as much resonance as an episode of \"The Waltons\" or \"Little House On The Prairie\". The basic idea of the young college girl writing up her town-life experience and causing controversy as she does so was used before in \"Peyton Place\", that historical but much decorated cinematic piece of soap opera, which for me is about the level the film achieves.\n\nIn addition, one of the major plot-lines (regarding the shall I say, tainted \"gift\" of a pie) was immediately apparent to me because of a similar scene I recalled from the seminal 70's TV series \"Roots\", which dealt with the big issue here more exhaustively and realistically. There are lots of episodic scenes demonstrating the ebb and flow of \"the help's\" struggle for acceptance, with some drop-in insertions to the narrative from real-time, real-life events such as the murder of Medgar Evers, but I felt the direction catered to the cosy and felt little real drama throughout.\n\nSimilarly I felt the acting to be showy and shallow by pretty much everyone in the cast, indeed no-one came across as real and I failed to engage with the characters. The depiction of time and place is excellent but students of this era looking for insight and emotional connection with this shaming episode of modern American history should buy or rent out \"Roots\" instead. Oh and make sure you get out of your seat quickly at the end to avoid the overblown Mary J Blige power-ballad over the end-titles which only adds to the disconnect here."

None of the books charisma and charm is lost with the transfer to the big screen, if anything it is amplified.\n\nFirst things first, cast: I don't think anyone at all is miscast in this film, if I had to say anyone was I would say maybe Emma Stone, but she does a good job in this film so you can forgive whatever qualms you have about her being cast as Skeeter. The rest of the cast is divine, it seems as though Tate Taylor assembled the greatest ensemble cast since the last Christopher Guest film. Octavia Spencer, Viola Davis, Allison Janney, Bryce Dallas Howard, Sissy Spacek and my personal favorite from the film, Jessica Chastain are all excellent, and all of them get to have their big moment, no one is left with nothing to do, all of them leave an impression.\n\nThe adaptation is missing a few little details from the book, but it's OK, the bulk of the story gets across quite well. I think it will be a crime if Octavia, Viola and Jessica aren't mentioned when awards season rolls around. Miss Chastain being the standout for me, I hope she wins absolutely everything, Her character Celia was my favorite from the book and Miss Chastain is just electric in her portrayal as this wonderful character. I love her, she's just so great.\n\nThis review is pretty bad but I just can't express in words how much I enjoyed it, just go see it and enjoy it for yourself."

        "review_detailed_main": "Based on a book of the same name by Kathryn Stockett, The Help talks about mid-century Southern USA and about a young aspiring writer, who decides to write about the eponymous help, the black people who pretty much made sure that everything stayed on course in the white households, from raising the children to checking that the roof was still up. She faces a few problems though. First of all it being extremely unpopular to talk about such a subject and second of all it being somewhat hard to find a black person brave enough to talk against whites.\n\nThis film was immensely popular in the States, like these films usually are, and I can kind of understand why. It's an uplifting story about a historical wrong that is still relevant even today, featuring an ensemble cast and great technical aspects.\n\nAnd yet, at the same time I'm watching this film and thinking to myself that I don't see the attraction. It might be that I have no touching point to this issue. I'm white, that much is true, but I'm also both Nordic and the son of a farmer. Slavery didn't enter into my worldview until I started watching movies aside from cartoons. And I'm watching this film where white people in the 1960s treat their help like they're cattle. Cattle with leprosy even. And I'm thinking that this is extremely silly and overblown. But for all I know it just might have been exactly like that, which is a chilling thought.\n\nThe ending is also too saccharine, in my opinion. Flowers rain from the sky, the wicked are punished and a holy choir sings Hallelujah kind of saccharine. But perhaps in America, where this is still a huge problem, that kind of an ending provides the needed emotional catharsis.\n\nLike with all these types of films, I don't feel like I'm qualified to judge them. I like the acting a lot, I like the story, I like how it looks and feels. I just find it a bit exaggerated, personally. As well as an hour too long. Still, worth a watch if the premise tickles your fancy."

This particular movie got the point across pretty well. It appeals to peoples' sense of fairness quite acutely.\n\nThe film has its good characters and bad ones, found some shades of grey too. It exhumed the wealth and lifestyle of the upper-class women of Jackson (site of the movie) in the 60s. It also pictures the society as tightly knit together: everybody knowing each other person. The underlying theme would the lacking equality of opportunity. The historical representation is interesting and seems right.\n\nThe Help is a very emotional movie and it succeeds in every aspect of it. It's very well focused on one or two topics, but doesn't go too narrow. I wouldn't recommend watching 'The Help' with pop corn and family, as it does get too cruel at times."

        "review_detailed_main": "In 1960s Mississippi, Southern society girl Skeeter (Emma Stone) returns from college with dreams of being a writer. She turns her small town on its ear by choosing to interview the black women who have spent their lives taking care of prominent white families. Only Aibileen (Viola Davis), the housekeeper of Skeeter's best friend, will talk at first. But as the pair continue the collaboration, more women decide to come forward, and as it turns out, they have quite a lot to say.\n\nAlthough I wish I hadn't waited so long to watch this movie, it felt like the perfect time for me to see it. Being one of the most uplifting and feel-good films I've seen in a long time. The film works beautifully as an entertaining film about a troubling period in American history and the people who were impacted by it. The film is elevated by performances from the three female leads as Emma Stone, once again, shows her range as a serious actress and Viola Davis epitomises courage through her sombre eyes. Octavia Spencer's Minny provides the movie's funniest moments, especially when she gets her own back on former employer Hilly with an audacious reprisal that proves that revenge is indeed a dish best served cold. Not only are the performances terrific, but the characters are also believable, likeable female characters set against the turbulence of Mississippi in the 1960s. In addition to being entertaining, the movie functions as a time capsule as well as a lesson in American history, women's and civil rights. I believe this movie will stand the test of time and it's one I will certainly recommend for the rest of my life."

Fine performances, overly-fine sets. That being said, good idea to mythologise the past, surely! But not without impacting the present, in other words, it is too easy to feel good coming away from this. In moral terms, it is nearly a black-and-white (no pun intended) presentation of the era, distancing itself too easily from messier, greyer reality. Perhaps it is worth it to simply let us play at being the daughter and the white person of our dreams, but I think today is worth too much to accept such a rendering of our past."

        "review_detailed_main": "I remember when I first read the book. The power from the story leaped from the pages and came to life all around me. So when I heard there was going to be a movie the only thing I could think was \"please let it be good!\" And now I finally saw it and I feel in love with the story all over again. At first I was a little curious at Emma Stone playing Skeeter because her in her previous movies just didn't throw at you \"southern-belle\" but then again this is probably one of the first outcast southern-belles to ever appear in movies, so her playing the outcast is more like what she does. She proves she can play many roles and this is just one of her best yet. This time, however, she goes into one of the most controversial topics to ever appear on the big screen.\n\nShe plays Skeeter, a college graduate who has great ambition and wants to be an accomplished writer but is sadly in 1960s Mississippi, a place at the time that greatly lacked the ability to accept change of any kind. So her options were running low but what she wanted to do was what anyone could do. However, before she can move to New York and start her own \"Happy Working Song\" she'll need to prove to the editor of the company she wants to work for (and most importantly herself) that she is a serious writer. So she asks her friend's black maid Aibileen to help her with a book about what it is like to be a black maid in Mississippi. Soon after Aibileen joins, many other women come up and ask to help with the book. So now Skeeter, Abileen, and Aibileen's smart-mouthed best friend Minny work together to change the way things work in Mississippi.\n\nBetween the three leading actors: Viola Davis as Aibileen, Emma Stone as Skeeter, and Octavia Spencer as Minny; the power comes directly from all three of them. However Viola Davis had enough power to carry the movie on her own. Up to this point we've only seen her on the side-lines as a supporting actor or cameo. Now we get to see what she can do and she doesn't disappoint.\n\nThe Help is perfectly crafted with powerful emotion and amazing performances from the three leading ladies. You will cry and laugh with this unforgettable story."

While the story is especially moving, we have been down this road before in MUCH better films... EXAMPLE, check out the movie that came out in 1990 \"The Long Walk Home\" which was pretty much ignored at the time... with Whoppi Goldberg (when she was an Oscar nominated actress fresh off Color Purple) and very ironically; Sissy Spacek! Whoppi that year won the supporting actress Oscar for \"Ghost\" (well deserved for a predominantly comedic performance...no complaints there)...just she was ignored for a best actress Oscar nod for a performance in LWH that mirrors Viola's performance. If you loved The Help, see Long Walk Home. One other beef... I can understand that current audiences love a good poop, bathroom humor joke in a comedy (most recently \"Bridesmaids\"). But in a drama as this, was there are more creative way to make the point of the pie eating scene? This movie goes for high drama and settles for sophomoric humor in that one part. That to me is pretty sad, as was attention and detail to the period. Emma Stone's hair with products with Aveda products to enhance and shine her curls, to make her look like she is on the cover of a 2001 Vogue? Looks like she just stepped out a Beverly Hills salon. Does not look like a girl of the period. Minor maybe, rest of period seems pretty well depicted ... unless I missed something else. Not a great film, but a flawed film with great performances worth seeing."

Yet, I can't help but praise this movie.\n\nSet in 1964 when there was a great divide between black and white people - apartheid as they call it in South Africa - the film deals with issues that will offend some viewers, and bring others to tears. Being white myself, I fail to understand why white people treated black people they way they did back then, and why there had to be this big advantage gap in the first place. People are people, are they not? People should be judged by their actions, and not the colour of their skin, or their background.\n\nOur heroin is Skeeter (Emma Stone) who grows tired of the rich and pretentious community's attitude towards (black) maids. She then decides to write a book from a maid's point of view, and how they perceive the situation they find themselves in. We so naively believe maids are there simply to do our daily chores, but they have lives and emotions too.\n\nThe first maid who agrees to be interviewed by Skeeter, is Aibileen (Viola Davis), followed by Minny (Octavia Spencer). Together, they form a bond, and the film becomes a heartfelt journey filled with emotion. The performances are fantastic. The script is really good, and I enjoyed the subtle score.\n\nI completely understand the relevance of the film, and the need for the story to be told. This is a good movie, with a positive, feel-good message, and a beautiful ending. Although not entirely my cup of tea, it was a movie well worth watching."

For example no girl in the early 60s would have worn her hair in Emma Stone's hopelessly anachronistic style. I blame Tate Taylor who was credited with the screenplay and direction. Apparently Taylor was born in Jackson and is a close friend of Kathryn Stockett. Can this really be how Ms Stockett wished her novel to be brought to the screen?

Her job on the Jackson Journal \u2013 writing a column on house cleaning tips \u2013 leads her into contact with the experts: black women who are the nannies, cooks and housekeepers for rich white folk. Thus begins an unlikely alliance that exposes the indignities suffered by black maids at the hands of Southern belles who ironically spend their idle moments raising money for African charities. The ultimate revenge of the maids is both funny and gross. The movie evokes many emotions; laughter, tears, anger and perhaps even shame. There are wonderful performances by the maids, Octavia Spencer and Viola Davis, who surely must be in the running for Oscar nominations.\n\nThe book on which the movie is based is pure fiction but the interspersing of historical facts \u2013 the murder of a civil rights campaigner and the assassination of President Kennedy \u2013 create the feel of a true story. The excesses of the era, from Ford Thunderbirds to the women's dresses and hairstyles, are authentically depicted. And there are real parallels between the fictional novelist (Skeeter Phelan \u2013 played by Emma Stone) and the book's author, Kathryn Stockett, who was born in Jackson, raised by a black nanny, and who struggled to get her first novel published.\n\nThe movie can also be viewed as a social commentary on the times. As such, it has been criticized for its stereotypes, caricatures, hyperbole, even racism. Such a criticism would be valid for a documentary but not for a work of fiction. Perhaps the criticism is an indication that the topic can still hit a raw nerve."

There is nothing extraordinary about it, it is just so easy to identify the bad people and you tend to like hating the bad guys. It is easy to follow the plot and is predictable. It follows stereotyped characters which is disappointing: The white Male does what is expected of him and of course the leading female character is liberated (even in 60s) we can not possibly have any deviation at all there. This type of writing takes humanity out of the movie; that is, the characters are politically correct sanitized and pasteurized for today's activist groups. I yet to see a refreshing movie coming out of the Hollywood franchises in the last few years. Putting this aside the movie is above average considering what comes out of Hollywood. It is not the kind of movie I would go to theater, it is rather a video night movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I read Kathryn Stockett's novel, The Help, it took me less than three days to read cover to cover. I fell in love with every character and imagined that, as a film, it would be stunning, emotive and compelling. Unfortunately, this adaptation didn't live up to my expectations.\n\nWhile Viola Davis and Jessica Chastain in particular, were both cast perfectly for their roles, I feel that a lot of the characters lacked individuality and spark. Some lovely characters (like Lou Anne) were erased all together, which disappointed me. Other characters, like Elizabeth Leefolt and Elaine Stein were cast incorrectly and did not live up to their full potential, I believe.\n\nOne commendable thing that The Help does, is that it tries to involve as much of the original story as possible. However, the book itself is so intricately woven with numerous stories, I feel that a lot of the poignant story lines from the book were not portrayed very well and appeared patchy in the film. Skeeter and Stuart's relationship, Celia's ongoing struggle with her change in class, and Mae Mobely's alone time with Aibeleen, for example. Another thing is Skeeter's mother's illness. In the book, her deteriorating health acts as an extended metaphor for the anonymously published book, and the struggles faced through it, but none of this was shown in the film, despite the fact that it could have worked very well.\n\nI don't feel that drama is created particularly well, (the whole involvement of Constantine came across as a bit 'naff' unlike the book, where it was incredibly moving). However, comedic scenes are the film's strongest point in my eyes. Minnie's 'Terrible Awful' occurrence and Celia Foote's portrayal in particular, were very funny, and evoked genuine laugh out loud moments.\n\nAll in all, however, I am sad to say that, despite some brilliant acting, The Help failed to live up to it's potential, appearing mismatched and vague. I feel that it would have developed better had it been created as a TV series. A slightly above average film, but still rather disappointing."

I read this book and absolutely fell in love with reading.\n\nI had always wanted to be a reader, but nothing held my attention. This book, far before the film, had my heart with every page.\n\nAs I said, I hadn't been a big reader, but this one was one I couldn't wait to come back to each night after dinner and kids' baths done. It was my time to myself. Not only did Katryn Stockett's ability to write as she spoke, she inspired me to write, myself.\n\nI grew up in Alabama. So, the language was quite familiar. This book is gripping. It will make you laugh and make you cry. The characters lept from pages, into my heart and soul.\n\nThen the film came out, the story that Stockett's friend Tate directed it only adds to the unlikely blockbuster. She swung for the fences and hit a homer. Now, I am patiently awaiting her second book after all this time. Kathryn if by chance you read this, please gift us again with your gift of storytelling. IT IS WHO YOU ARE! And Grandaddy Stockett left you his gift. Don't keep it tucked away. I believe you have another amazing story to share with us if not many. Thank you for the gift of, \"The Help.\" You encouraged me to write.\n\nIf you haven't seen this film, do yourself the favor and get the book first. There are many little details you will enjoy. This author tells the story as if you are sitting in the room listening. Oh how I cried at the end, (no spoilers) I was sad because didn't want it to end."

Of course not. She set her own personal values aside in order to make a difference. This movie had me laughing. It had me crying. It had my heart breaking. Then it had me leaping for joy.

        "review_title": "Often heavy-handed and overly sentimental, yet ultimately entertaining and emotionally resonant.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Yes, 'The Help (2011)' is often heavy-handed, soppy and overly sentimental, and it does - to a degree - feel as though it was only created to garner the critical acclaim and Oscar buzz it inevitably did. However, it also strikes a chord on a number of key levels and manages to move past its basic presentation to provide a perhaps surprisingly resonant experience, one that takes a unique and relatively unflinching look - given it's essentially a 'feel-good' flick designed to reach as wide an audience as possible - at America's darker domestic days and proves that the best way forward is to remember and educate rather than ignore and forget. The star-studded, somewhat eclectic narrative moves between a number of key perspectives to tell its alternate civil rights tale and all of them are brought to life with well-rounded, period-and-place accurate writing and excellent performances. Some mention has been made about how much of the piece focuses on a young white woman who aims to shed light on the situation she sees around her and, indeed, it could be argued that the picture itself serves to make most white audiences feel better about themselves as they'll most likely relate to her as opposed the more overly racist antagonists, but the movie itself features plenty of strong black characters who take control of their own situation and it doesn't actually present any of its proceedings as instant 'solutions' to anything, instead showing the positive and negative outcomes of the risky actions taken by all its core players within both their wider and more personal contexts. It's commendable that the film focuses so heavily on a strong, racially-diverse female ensemble while also promoting equality both on and off screen, through its very existence. To pick apart one of the few examples of this is perhaps reductive, though lamenting a civil rights struggle being framed through a white protagonist's perspective is understandable. On the whole, the feature is fairly endearing at times and rather emotionally affecting at others. It may be quite 'by the book', so to speak, but it's ultimately an entertaining drama that takes a tough situation and examines it through several well-rounded characters. 7/10"

But i got bored very quickly by the way the movie just does not seem to pick up pace. I've seen movies on this subject before and, well, it's not my cup of tea really. I kept my mind open and was fully ready to see this movie. Based on the ratings, awards, it's got to be a good movie. Without doubt it's well played/acted, but, the story is where it goes sour in my opinion. What I said in the summary, yawn, it simply does not seem to pick up any pace. There seem to be a lot of flash backs or flash forwards, whatever way you look at it, but that does not add to the story at all, it actually makes it complicated, slowing down the actual story. They should have stuck to the theme and kept it chronological. I was so bored I actually stopped watching it, I never made it to the end, and I'll never will. If you really are in to the theme of the movie and you want to see the story and are not phased by possible boredom, go see it, it's well played. If it's not fully your cup of tea but you have an open mind, try it, make up your mind yourself. If you don't really like that type of stories andare not much for patience, don't bother, you won't finish it."

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie \"The Color of Emotions\" sheds light on the painful history of racism while exploring the powerful relationships between black and white characters in 1960s Mississippi. Adapted from Kathryn Stockett's bold novel, the film, under Tate Taylor's direction, transforms into a compelling cinematic masterpiece. The performances of Emma Stone and Viola Davis in the leading roles leave a profound impact on the audience. However, the exaggeration of stereotypes and caricatured characters weakens the film. Nevertheless, it delivers a profound story of resistance against racism and the values of humanity. \"The Color of Emotions\" not only encourages viewers to watch but also to reflect and discuss. It's definitely a movie worth watching, and reading the novel afterwards is highly recommended."

        "review_title": "I've seen much better",
        "review_detailed_main": "If you want to watch a film about racism, I do not recommend this one. While it may do a few things right, it suffers from numerous flaws. I didn't really care for this film that much, and it could have been a lot better.\n\nA young woman named Skeeter who is trying to become an author during the civil rights movement of the 60's decides to write a book detailing the lives of African-American maids and how they're treated. As the word about her book gets out, many more African-American maids come to her to help her write her book by telling her how they are treated.\n\nThe first issue I have with this film is that it's overly emotionally manipulative. At some points in the movie, it feels like director Tate Taylor is grasping for straws to find anything which might draw an emotion out of the audience. This can be distracting at some points in the film because it's used a lot. In this case, however, I found most of its attempts to be ineffective at giving me a connection with the characters. The only one which was effective for me was the one used at the very end of the film. However, none of the other sad scenes in the film worked. I find this flaw a lot with feel good movies, and I wish that directors would try to avoid this as this is one of the main things which can bring me out of a movie.\n\nAnother flaw is that most of the characters are overly clich\u00e9 and are caricatures. The characters seem to be everything you would expect to find in a film about racism. They make almost every white character to be a racist. Also, they make it so one progressive white character is able to see through the conflict and want to help the African-Americans maids in the film. Also, some of the black characters are very stereotypical and somewhat racist. The film makes it so that almost every black character loves fried chicken. In fact, they show this several points in the film. I really wished that they didn't do it because I found that to be kind of jarring. Since about all of the main characters felt reductive, it sort of took me out of the film.\n\nAnother area the film misses in is that it doesn't show the absolute lows of racism. It doesn't need to be hyper-violent, but it should at least have enough violence to make it hit hard enough with the viewer. Since it doesn't show enough violence to give it an accurate portrayal of how life really was like for African-Americans in the 60's, I felt like the movie was too safe. A movie about racism being too safe is never a good thing. There are some movie plots and settings that I feel require for their movies to focus on the absolute lows of their setting. Racism is definitely one of them.\n\nAlso, the main character, Skeeter, feels very anachronistic. It feels like Kathryn Stocket (the author of the book this film is based on) projected her own modern-day fulfillment to have such a progressive minded, white female. If someone like Skeeter wanted to write a book about interviews from African Americans from the 60's, those kinds of people usually came from the North and even then, they would be treated with violence. However, to have that character come from the South and write a book like that - it's simply wish fulfillment on Stocket's part. No book like \"The Help\" would have ever existed and it would've never been published during the 60's. Because of this, the atmospheric feeling of institutional racism does not feel very realistic in the film.\n\nAnother flaw is the movie's overall length. I feel like the movie could've been a lot shorter. I'll even argue that it could've been cut down to just under 2 hours. Since it was relatively slow-paced, there were several times when the film didn't have my full attention and other times when I wanted it to end or get going with its main story. One of the plot points which could have been cut from the film was Skeeter's relationship with Stuart. I didn't buy for a second that Skeeter would've been attracted to him and would've gone out with him for quite some time. Wouldn't she have concluded from the beginning that he was a racist and not want to have anything to do with him?\n\nWith that being said, that's not to say that I liked nothing about this film. To me, its biggest strength lies in the acting. Many actresses give amazing performances. Emma Stone, Viola Davis, and Octavia Spencer both give amazing performances and they helped to carry the movie very well. However, some performances weren't that good. Bryce Dallas Howard gave an overall good performance, but there were some times when she sounded over-the-top. Also, Jessica Chastain wasn't able to act convincingly as a drunk without sounding annoying and cringeworthy. It had weak performances, but most of them were overall solid.\n\nAlso, the film does a good job at reminding us that the African-Americans who wrote the book had to face not only threats of violence from the hateful backlash of angry whites in their hometown, but also a multiplicity of indignities in their hometowns, including being forced to sit at the back of buses and having to use separate restrooms.\n\nIn conclusion, while this film does a few things right, it is weighed down by being overly emotionally manipulative, using several clich\u00e9 caricatures, not hitting the lows of racism well enough, an anachronistic plot, and the slow-pacing. Of course, the majority of its acting and how it displays hardships that African-Americans faced are good, but that's really all I can say for this film. It could've been great, but it didn't do that much for me."

Having been raised by a Negro nanny whom she adored, she decides to interview other local Negroes who serve as maids or nannies to white families in the area, and write a book about their experiences. The film shows some of the barriers between whites and blacks; Skeeter's efforts help begin to surmount some of those.\n\nI spent a year in Mississippi in the early '60s and, IMO, the film's vision of the (white) Junior League of that era is slightly a caricature--but fairly accurate in flavor. What is quite inaccurate is having a Jr. Leaguer in Skeeter's fact-finding role at that time, or having blacks daring to support Skeeter to the extent they're shown doing. It's equally inaccurate to portray racist whites as hateful; in that era, many white people with otherwise admirable qualities were racists.\n\nIn a sense, the movie has a fairy tale quality with time traveling mixed in (i.e., as if today's sensibilities travel back to examine the '60s Mississippi scene, inhabit Skeeter and a few blacks, and then begin taking corrective action through them). It's an \"ultra light civil rights\" version of Mississippi (& similar parts of the South), one that ignores the overlapping memberships of community leaders in White Citizen Councils, police in the Ku Klux Klan, and all those, and many, many others, staunch members in many white churches.\n\nBut the film's acting was great: Davis, Spencer, Howard, Chastain, & Stone make this fairy tale come alive. It's primarily about relationships between women (and women DO seem to enjoy the movie very much). IMDb's demographic ratings consistently reflect that females, whatever their ages, rate the film about 10% higher than males; it seems much more appealing to women--likewise, for my 2 female companions at the movie, it was a 10 of 10.\n\nIt's fairly safe to say: if you loved the book, you'll love this movie."

You gather that as the news covers the funeral of JFK at one point.\n\nThe film is set on the eve of the civil rights era then but such things move slowly in the Southern states and here we have black women who practically raise the white kids from infants onwards and as they grow up they become like their parents including the prejudice and the cycle starts again as the maid raise their kids.\n\nEven though the discriminatory behaviour has been toned down for the film, part of it still feels very uneasy although in reality things were probably a lot worse for real life maids.\n\nViola Davis and Octavia Spencer stand out from the cast as two of the maids. Also good performances from Jessica Chastain, Bryce Dallas Howard and Emma Stone.\n\nIt may not be as powerful as you think it would be. Given that it seems to be aimed at a female audience you get the feeling the director did not want to cross a certain line and make it more hard hitting.\n\nIt is funny as well as emotional and an interesting tale."

I thought it was gross and despicable what the maid did to the pie. So, everyone who has been mistreated should feel entitled do something like that?! Most everyone had horrible, fake Southern accents. I thought Cicley Tyson was her usual terrible actress. I think the whole book and movie are way overrated and Hollywood will likely give it the Oscar because it's right down their alley."

Skeeters fling added nothing to the movie. Zilch.

Yes, Emma Stone is vivacious, spirited and fetching. But Bryce Dallas Howard makes a caricature of the sinister, racist-to-the-core Hilly, and the movie never gives enough time to see the poignant turn-around Skeeter's mother accomplishes, nor lay out the real dangers the servants faced by telling tales out of school.\n\nMuch of the book's comedic effect is also lost. Some great lines in the book are dropped. (\"He was drunker than an Indian on payday\".)\n\nCelia's white-trash ferocity as she possibly saves Minny's life was also skipped over, diminishing an already diminished role in the movie.\n\nThese are just a few of the several disappointments with the cinematic version, none of them fatal to the experience, but letdowns nonetheless.\n\nStill, this film can't help but satisfy because the book it is based on is so incredibly strong, and the times it depicts are so indelibly emotional. Wisely, the movie takes full advantage of being able to do what a book cannot; the real-life footage of the Medgar Evers murder, TV clips of civil rights marchers being beaten, the rousing news reels of Martin Luther King \u2014 all hit on a gut level where a book cannot, especially for those of us who lived through them and saw them first-hand.\n\nMy overall advice: See the movie first ... then really treat yourself by reading the book. One is a great appetizer; the other is the full meal."

I can't abide someone criticizing a film because it doesn't depict things the way they are today. Does that negate any film with an historical base. This is a single slice of life portrayal with well meaning people using the hand dealt to them. To say that they are caricatures is really unfair. We focus in on principal characters who carry the weight of the movie. When we look at the larger picture, we see an oppressed and manipulated group that we don't see. But they are there. They just don't have the wherewithal to make change. Sometimes it would be life threatening. Granted there are some cheap thrills. The famous pie or the young white housewife and her foibles. But this makes good storytelling. It doesn't damn everybody. There are some good people and there were some good people. I personally believe the author did a superb job of creating the tension that existed. Nothing happened simply. It's also about turnabout. Let the fifties speak for themselves. Few ever had an advocate like these."

We both enjoyed this fictional account of many of the African-American female maids and their stories they tell to an aspiring author named Skeeter (Emma Stone). Among those female servants, Abileen (Viola Davis) and Minny (Octavia Spencer) provide the most interesting of their trials of working for their employers. The most mean of the white employers is one Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) who gets most of her comeuppance in the most dirty ways one can imagine. Then, on the other side of the tracks is Celia (Jessica Chastain) who somehow becomes Minny's savior and vice versa. There's also good supporting turns from Sissy Spacek, Cicely Tyson, Mary Steenburgen and especially Allison Janney. Since I haven't read the book, I'm sure there are some details I haven't been privy to that I'm sure might have made this movie even more compelling.

For example, her relationship with that guy didn't make much sense. He acts like an idiot and she tells him off. Then he apologises and for some reason she just accepts it and it's suddenly all good until he shows his true colours again. Funnily enough, it's her mother who actually has the most interesting character development in the family.\n\nOn the other hand, the two maids, Aibileen and Minny, easily steal the show, typical instances of people whose lives are defined by race and class. Celia is another character with her own arc that eventually overlaps with the main plot. She is also a victim of prejudice in a slighty different way."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Help is at once a joy to watch for its absorbing yet haunting story and for the superior acting by Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer. On the other hand, it is nauseating at times to suffer through the scenes of outright cruelty perpetrated by the white women of the south in the early 1960s. It is one thing to read about Jim Crow in a book or listen to an old person nowadays discussing what it was like, but to see reenactments of just how dehumanizing and vindictive the times were is just unsettling. This is an important story, fictional yes, but representative of a time and a place which reminds the audience just how ashamed we should be at aspects of our past.\n\nA few decades ago in the south, it was commonplace for a white family to employ a black maid. Maid is an all encompassing term for house cleaner, cook, nanny, grocery shopper, butler, and every other menial task you could think of. They potty trained the toddlers, read them stories, and pretty much raised the children instead of their mothers who were enjoying that afternoon's bridge party. This particular story takes place in Jackson, MS and focuses on three main characters.\n\n'Skeeter' (Emma Stone) has just graduated from Ole Miss, one of her only clique to do so, and returned home to get her foot in the door at the local paper. It appears she went to school for an education rather than to husband hunt which sets her apart from her friends. She wants to be a writer but does not have the experience to get hired on by a true publishing firm. What really separate Skeeter though is that she has a much more enlightened view on race relations. This is odd. Where did this character pick up the notion that perhaps certain things should not just be left alone and separate but equal is anything but? Skeeter's mother (Alison Janney) does not display any sentiment towards her maid and Ole Miss was not widely acknowledged to be a bastion of forward and progressive thinking thought in 1963. It is strange that Skeeter is of such a different mold than the rest, but there would be no plot if she was not.\n\nIllicitly, Skeeter starts to interview the black maids of the town. She spends most of her time with Aibileen (Viola Davis) and Minnie (Octavia Spencer). These two maids share with Skeeter their horror stories of maltreatment, child neglect, and every other behind the curtain story their employer would not want anyone else to know. Skeeter is combining all of the maids' stories into a book to tell the rest of the country what is going on down south from the maids' perspective this time.\n\nI have a hunch that come awards time, there will be a Best Actress nomination for Viola Davis and a supporting nomination for Octavia Spencer. The film is strongest when they are on screen. Viola showed traces of her character in 2008's Doubt and this is Octavia's first true starring role. When the film flips back and focuses on the white women for a time, especially when it shows Skeeter trying to find a boyfriend or argue with her mother, the atmosphere loses its tension and the pacing slows until it gets back on track with the maids. This film is truly unsettling at times, but well worth the audience's discomfort to show them a time and a place not very long ago which was not just immoral, but malicious."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I first learned of \"The Help\" - having never even heard of the book - I almost immediately heard conflicting descriptions of it. The praise was that it was a thought-provoking account of the Civil Rights era. The criticism was that it gave white people most of the credit for the movement and relegated blacks to the roles of servants. Now that I've seen it, I'd say that there's some truth to both descriptions. Part of what we see is that the white employers put on the veneer of civility but clearly view the black servants as beneath them.\n\nThere is the problem that the end story is basically through the eyes of a white person telling the stories of black maids, so it does seem to be giving her extra credit. But in the end, I think that the movie came out very well. Octavia Spencer - who won Best Supporting Actress for her role - is particularly good (especially when you see the trick that her character plays with the pie).\n\nThe movie also forces one to think about the current state of race relations in the United States. We may have a non-white president and the younger generation may be the most colorblind, but can we be certain that racial tensions aren't simmering beneath the surface? All in all, I recommend the movie."

And it's so weird to realize that the entire main cast (except for Bryce Dallas Howard) had, or has now, won an Oscar. Hopefully Viola Davis will someday win the Best Actress Oscar she deserves."

Bryce Dallas Howard also overplayed Hilly Holbrook in what could have become one of the great on screen villains. The cinematography was also very bland and poor. Having recently seen the likes of Drive, and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy at the cinema 'The Help' appears as if it was shot by a 12 year old with his first camera in comparison. Normally I find IMDb ratings an accurate basis of a film's quality. How this Sunday afternoon schmaltz has got 8 stars is beyond me."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Help depicts a brutally honest time in American history where whites were superior and the blacks were inferior. Right around the Jim Crow era where the typical white family lived in a sizable house, with kids, and some of the richer families had a black maid to look after the kid(s). The black maid was forced to drop everything in her home life to cater to the, sometimes cruel, white family. They were expected to be fast, friendly, and honest. They were the help.\n\nThe film is based on the novel by Kathryn Stockett, who was raised by a black woman because her mother was working a lot of the time. The Help shows how some maids became the mother of the child, and at some point, they were even called \"mom.\" Reminds me of a Hank Williams song My Son Called Another Man Daddy. Only difference is the mothers in this didn't seem to mind the maid being called the mother. They were too busy to notice.\n\nThe story is about two African American maids named Aibileen (Davis), a middle-aged woman who has been taking care of white kids for nearly her entire life and just lost her son. And Minny (Spencer), the mouth of the two with an abusive husband, but a great sense of humor. She provides much of the comic relief to this story.\n\nJackson, Mississippi, the town of the film, bribes blacks of their freedom of speech and their rights. They literally have no say in anything. A woman was beaten for going down to vote, and some have even been killed. Brave aspiring-journalist Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan (Stone) has just been hired by the Jackson Journal newspaper, and is set to write an article, which turns into a novel, with the help serving as the voice of the book. Skeeter wants people to know that these humans have their own lives, but spend their time taking care of other children, being forced to work under whatever circumstances and limitations they have, while being the subject to verbal abuse by their employers and racial segregation in the household.\n\nTo the whites, the blacks might as well be mannequins that can do work. The don't care about their feelings or their opinions just as long as they work efficiently and clean up after themselves. The characters, on the other hand, are introduced at hyper-speed, but the story cleans up after itself and takes time to introduce them one by one, giving proper and worthy character development to each.\n\nEmma Stone is charismatic, while the maids are hilarious in portions of the film as well. Even in the films darkest hour, it manages to keep a sunny disposition and not get bogged down by painful scenes and a depressing feel. Sure the end credits to leave room for some tears, but scattered scenes across the movie brought the audience I was accompanied with to cheers, screams, laughter, clapping, and sadness, it's all realistic and honest.\n\nTo wrap up the summer, The Help is a gem. A break from all the comedy, romance, and talking animals. It's sure to be overlooked by a younger audience, when it shouldn't. This is an important film, that needs to be seen by many. It's good things like this come out, reminding the public of the past. Those who don't know history are likely to repeat it, and we need films like The Help to prevent that. No one likes repetition. Especially in reality.\n\nStarring: Emma Stone, Bryce Dallas Howard, Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Mike Vogel, Allison Janney, and Chris Lowell. Directed by: Tate Taylor."

All the cast were top notch and delivered great performances. At times it felt effortless, in the way the narrative played out, to the chemistry and the development of the characters, it all felt natural and enjoyable to watch. This is like the American version of \"The King's Speech\" (2011) in terms of how the Americans have taken to this film like the Brits did with the Colin Firth led drama. Yet, you don't feel alienated or isolated and instead you watch a tragic yet heart warming story. A watch for all to see."

Basically it is a typical feel-good story, set in a small town with obvious racial tension. The story is at times predictable - though that often feels irrelevant for movies like this. It has been criticized for being another \"white savior\" movie, where the white character is needed to help the black characters out of their situation. I agree that it is too bad that there still are so many movies about this kind of stories being made, this movie handles it quite nicely.\n\nThe highlight of this movie is the cast. There are some great performances in this movie from actors I was completely unfamiliar with. Mostly the \"helps\" are doing a great job, enhanced by convincing (to me) costume- and set-design.\n\nI wish that this movie would have had higher ambitions, gone longer in exploring the good side of \"evil\" people and the bad side of the good - making the characters all more human. There is a scene near the end where a certain character reveals a side of herself. I wish that this could have been a thread throughout the movie, that this ambivalence was given - not a reveal. I guess it would have been a different movie, but definitely a more interesting one."

But really it seems to be set in an alternate universe where nothing makes any sense. How is it that the protagonist has grown up in the same society as all the other (racist) women, yet has a completely modern, 21st century viewpoint? Things just don't work that way.\n\nRacism in the movie was portrayed as a pervasive but ultimately trivial issue. The movie reduced racism to the petty meanness of society ladies, largely skirting issues such as sexual harassment and mob violence. We have one scene of police brutality and another scene with a vague reference to a shooting, but these events seem to come out of nowhere and vanish without a trace afterward. What happens to the woman who is arrested, after the arrest? We never find out.\n\nAnother thing that bothered me about this movie was how the black women are portrayed as largely feeble and helpless until the white women (\"Skeeter\" and Celia, in particular) teach them to stand up for themselves. This was partly due to the fact that the movie was, first and foremost, about Eugenia's coming-of-age experience and not about \"the help\" at all. But still, it was dissatisfying.\n\nIn addition to these issues, the characterization was rather poor and the cinematography was nothing special.\n\nI wish I were more well-versed in history, so I really lay into this movie properly. But even as my uninformed self, I could tell that there were many things wrong with this movie. Not recommended."

In fact, late-summer dramas don't come around much period, but \"The Help\" has just the right pinches of humor and bright colors to keep it from becoming a weighty affair more suited for the winter awards contenders. Don't assume, however, that come the turn of seasons that anyone will have forgotten \"The Help\" come awards time.\n\nTate Taylor adapts and directs Kathryn Stockett's best-selling novel about African-American maids living in Jackson, Miss. in the Jim Crow era. Viola Davis plays Aibileen, a woman who has been raising the children of wealthy Southern white families for decades. When college grad Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan (Emma Stone) returns home with aspirations of becoming a journalist, she tries to convince Aibileen and fellow maid Minnie (Octavia Spencer) to tell their stories in hopes of getting their perspective heard. Although the women fear their identities being discovered, the prejudicial attitudes of Miss Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard) and her initiative to force homes with maids to provide a separate bathroom for The Help provokes them to courageously speak up.\n\n\"The Help\" puts out a massive ensemble effort glowing with talent. Never has a female- dominated cast of this size given such strong performances across the board. Aibileen provides the narrative voice, but Skeeter, Minnie and others each get their stories told in full depth and the supporting roles from the likes of Allison Janney as Skeeter's mother and Sissy Spacek as Hilly's mother are priceless.\n\nIf a standout has to be chosen for Oscar consideration, it has to be Davis. There's that constant look in her eyes suggesting that she's always carrying every single thing her character has ever been through into every scene. She's penetratingly real; she is everyone's mother. She also brings the film's wide range of emotions, though the comedy would be Spencer's forte.\n\nSpencer, a long-time small-role character actor, follows Taylor from his first feature-length film \"Pretty Ugly People.\" She makes the film a true delight with a hold-nothing-back attitude. Minnie embodies some racial stereotypes, but the script gives her such incredible depth that we associate those things with who she truly is, not as a vehicle for humor.\n\nPerhaps \u2014 oddly enough \u2014 too many characters feel multi-dimensional and \"The Help\" lacks a true focus for a film running nearly two and a half hours, but the acting is so sharp at all levels that it never feels boring or hollow. The characters and the many situations and problems they deal with feel unmistakably real, namely because those problems break the mold for Southern Civil Rights drama.\n\nThe film avoids being another example of how terrible things once were and how poorly blacks were treated. It asks us to feel sorry for everyone, not just the African-American characters and scratch our heads at how life was ever like that anywhere in this country. Ultimately, \"The Help\" tells a story of courage in one of its unlikeliest forms \u2014 telling the truth, making sure all side are heard. It uses such a diverse tool set of characters to get that point across.\n\nTaylor's much more concerned about working with these actresses to create compelling portraits of characters and relationships in a place and time full of unique issues than he is with creating gripping drama. Considering the film is no less poignant and maybe all the more likable for it, he made the right choice.\n\n~Steven C\n\nVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "I took the time recently to see a wonderful ensemble drama called The Help, a film based on the novel by Kathryn Stockett.\n\nThe film centers around two main story lines in Jackson, Mississippi in the 1960's: First of which are the African-American housemaids working for white families. This includes Aibileen (Played by Viola Davis), a woman whose spent her whole life as a maid, not to mention having lost her only son, but still stays true to her beliefs.\n\nThe other main narrative is that of Eugenia Phelan, aka. Skeeter (Played by Emma Stone), a woman recently hired by the local Jackson newspaper, who wants to have interviews from the point of view of the housemaids, even though they could face jail time for doing so. Never the less, Aibileen accepts, and Skeeter's project starts to form.\n\nSome would probably accuse The Help's screenplay of feeling emotionally forced, but what writer/director Tate Taylor constructs is actually a more honest, emotionally involving project. The themes of racial segregation give the film a dramatic edge, but it's also brimming with irresistible humor. What could have been a sappy melodrama actually feels more sincere.\n\nSame goes for the cast, who could have been butchered if not for casting directors Kerry Barden and Paul Schnee just nailing it. It's hard to pick a standout, but it's worth noting the individuals for their work.\n\nJessica Chastain performs with equal hilarity and grace. Viola Davis, the closest thing to a standout, gives off understated, but powerful emotion. Bryce Dallas Howard, normally a very sweet soul, is evil enough to get your nostrils flaring. Allison Janney gives off a sarcastic, but also sympathetic vibe. Sissy Spacek tickles in her small supporting role. Octavia Spencer excels with a no bull crap attitude. And Emma Stone, with her charm and believability, works wonders as Skeeter.\n\nI must also make note of the technical crew of the film. Sharen Davis' costume define an extra depth of personality, and Thomas Newman supplies another emotionally potent orchestral score. Oh, and I almost forgot about editor Hughes Winborne. At a little over two hours and fifteen minutes long, the movie just flies by.\n\nForgive me if I overrate, but The Help was too good for me to ignore. I give it ***1/2 out of ****"

Stellar performance. Hand these two ladies every possible award and recognition right now. They are that good. No, better than that good.\n\nCicely Tyson. Transcendent. It is one of those moments where every second she is on screen, you cannot take your eyes off of her.\n\nThe story. As well written as you are going to get. Ever.\n\nEmma Stone. She brought her A game. She had no choice... to keep up with the other ladies who delivered stellar performances.\n\nThe physicality that Ms. Davis, Ms. Spencer and Ms. Tyson brought to their characters is masterful.\n\nDirection. It is excellent when we are able to experience this level of talent. Give the director whatever he wants. Top shelf.\n\nOverall, a superb film."

Octavia Spencer is the best out of all the actors, she's just so intense and you never want to look away whenever she's in a scene, you better believe she's a force to be reckoned with. WELL deserved academy award win! Emma Stone is great here too, very believable performance. And then there's Allison Janney and Sissy Spacek, who both really impressed me with their portrayals of their characters. And Bryce Dallas Howard was incredible in her sinister nasty role of Hilly Hollbrook. Oh and you cannot forget about Jessica chastain! Her portrayal of Celia Foote is near perfection, so down to earth and kind, a true lamb among wolves. The movie does a masterful job at telling these African American maids stories and seeing how the disgraceful conditions that were present in those times really affected people. The writing and the acting combines in an effective way, the two things are just so great here that when you put them together it almost knocks you back lol. The scenes are wonderfully directed and have perfect timing. The character depth is ever deep and you are left very satisfied. Each character's story gets resolved in some way and you are left also feeling refreshed and renewed when this film comes to an end. 10/10 for The Help!! If you haven't seen this moving powerful movie, then what the hell are you waiting for?!! Afterwards have yourself some freshly fried chicken with some chocolate pie for desert ;)"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Help\" has so many positive things to say and is full of such good actors giving such good performances that it's pretty hard to outright dislike. It's one of those movies that seems really good while you're in the middle of watching it but begins to fall apart somewhat when you think back on it. I wonder how much different the viewing experience would be if you'd read the book on which it was based (I have not). As it is, there are many parts that feel like they're in the film because they're in the book but weren't as fully fleshed out in the movie as I imagine they were in the novel. An entire storyline involving Jessica Chastain as a helpless housewife who turns to her black maid to help her is welcome because it gives Chastain a chance to deliver a winning and immensely likable performance, but I'm not sure what it really had to do with the rest of the movie around it. The character played by Allison Janney doesn't make much sense at all. Representative of a certain kind of white person who's basically well meaning but allows peer pressure to turn her eyes away from the injustices of segregation, her character is first portrayed as a foolish and vain woman with whom we're supposed to be disgusted and then turns on a dime to become a champion for her daughter, played as appealingly as always by Emma Stone, when her daughter writes an expose of white oppression from the point of view of the black household staffs. And don't even get me started on the character played by Bryce Dallas Howard, an unlikable actress anyway who's given a gross caricature to play, so vile but ultimately so juvenile that she threatens to undermine the entire point of the movie -- if all racists were as silly and as easy to dismiss as her, all of our race problems would be solved.\n\nViola Davis and Octavia Spencer, as the two black maids at the center of the story, deserve the accolades that have been directed their way. My only complaint, which is really a compliment, is that Davis had been given more screen time.\n\nGrade: B+"

        "review_title": "predictability saved by the power of female acting chops, especially Viola Davis",
        "review_detailed_main": "I may be giving this a higher rating that it deserves; it's a predictably plotted story and you know how a lot of it's going to go, what lessons may be learned by and to whom and so on. But like The King's Speech, it's nice to see an Oscar-bait(ish) movie that has strong performances (with one exception, which I'll get to momentarily) and on its own terms is pretty good. Not very good, or great, and The Help may be overrated, but it carries a strong message and I liked seeing these actors as these characters together, for the most part.\n\nAs a story surrounding the Noble White Savior(TM) it surprised me how the cast was handled very evenly (Viola Davis got a best actress, not supporting, nomination for good reason and probably should've won all things considered). I thought it would be the Emma Stone show, with her as the Mississippi writer who works for a local paper but gets inspired by what she sees with the local maids working for generations (basically linked by blood and heritage and all to slavery) and gets a book deal about what it's like for 'the Help' to work and live. I though that all these other women (this is very much a woman-centric movie as well, which is commendable, albeit directed by a man) as small side characters. Not really the case, which helps since if you get tired of seeing one character it'll soon flip over to another.\n\nI heard from a few friends in the years before seeing this that Octavia Spencer's Minny was over the top, playing up the \"mmHMM\" Big Black Lady stereotype and got an undeserved Oscar. I thought she was fine, and more than that really, and got to portray a fully fleshed out character, and especially put against two very different white ladies - Bryce Dallas Howard's Hilly and Jessica Chastain's Celia, both she works for at separate times - we see how she can be your best friend or your worst enemy (if you push her far enough and hard for a long time like Hilly).\n\nIf I had any problem it was with Howard, though that may be more in the writing; she's the one clear antagonist, but by and large because whenever she's on screen, even if she's sitting peacefully and only saying a little bit, there's a feeling like 'oh wow, what's she about to say now or put on that ugly-mean thing that has the guise of 'Southern Gentility'. But with what little she's given I found Howard more caricature than character, while Chastain, also seemingly not given quite a lot with a white-trash lady like Celia, she was a lot more fun and interesting and had real dynamics to play with (and tragedy as well). Perhaps I'm wrong and Hilly was fun to play as well, but I'm not sure I saw it.\n\nThe heart of the movie though is Davis, and without her I probably wouldn't recommend the movie as much as I do. Yes, the great Allison Janney, in just a handful of scenes, does wonders as she always does as Stone's mother, and Emma Stone's Skeeter herself is really good as well (a few moments that should be especially tear-jerkery, like with a revelation surrounding a formerly employed maid who raised Skeeter, feel earned just by how much the actresses commit and don't let a lot of falsehood enter their performances).\n\nBut I just felt the movie take it up a notch or two with Davis there, and I'm sure (first-time!) director Tate Taylor knew that as well. Just simple scenes showing Aibileen playing with the little white baby girl, or protecting her under a mattress during a tornado, there's just so much warmth to play with but also a lot of horror from that period of time in history, and she finds it all. Even (maybe especially) when she says little and is just standing there, exhausted, sad, trying to hide her deep-seated rage, Davis reminds us not just about how good she can act but about the constant, just understood horrors of the black experience at that time and place.\n\nIn short, The Help is highly watchable as an actor's movie, and compensates for a little over-length (I'm not sure where, but it could've lost ten minutes somewhere I bet) and with things moving at a pace where you know how things will end up with this book coming out and who may or may not get it. Needless to say the ending also caught me off guard for how emotional it got, also genuinely and to a point where I was sold by what the actors were doing but also the deeper implications of what this ending meant for everyone involved."

Cissy Spacek has a plum role that she makes the most of. Octavia Spencer is a jewel and I would love to see more from her. Emma Stone was also okay in her role but the character of her mother played by Allison Janney is great. The two things that are ultimately wrong are the portrayal of most of the men, black and white and the story concerning Skeeters' maid which was very weak; though Cicelie Tyson does a wonderful job with the minute role. Yes it is a feel good movie and you feel really good. Just one more note my daughter and I were the only Black people in the theater and it really made me have to think. Are these kind of movies the only ones that white people will come and see? And the audience was majority white women. Why won't they come to see other stories where black people are the center of the story and I don't count Tyler Perry movies. Just something to think about."

I have a real aversion to being told what I must like and how much I should like it. I resisted Harry Potter for a good few years until my nieces insisted I read it to them. And then? Actually I though thought the first book was bland and distinctly average and, had it not been for the gentle urging of a respected friend, I would have stopped at book one. The Help, apparently unable to speak for itself, is another work being touted by the world's media as a great, a must-see, an Oscar certainty\u0085 It's another cinematic bandwagon laden with unthinking passengers who are enjoying the mild hysteria they're experiencing and justifying by the ever-growing mountain of awards that is burying the film.\n\nFor those who walk around with their fingers in their ears, it serves up the story of a privileged white girl who, in a bid to launch her writing career, hits upon the idea of writing a book from the point of view of the slaves, sorry, the help, who keep her home, and that of all the homes of the rich white folk in the deep south of America, going. It's onto a winner from the outset and has no work to do because, let's face it, we all know that racism is evil and, for the most part, the white folk have learned that much of what they did was despicable.\n\nI entered the cinema with an expectation, and perhaps even a determined hope, if I'm honest, that the film would fail for me and I'd leave unmoved and with thoughts overloaded with disdain to hurl into this post. I left with a slightly modified view and an emotional tickling i.e. not as severe as a bashing.\n\nI strongly suspect The Help is 2012's Driving Miss Daisy, to wit, we'll shower it with accolades now but in a few years we'll realize we've been hoodwinked and, actually, it's not very good. Yes, it serves up a few good moments of lumpy throat emotion but it wasn't sufficient to make me blub. Yes, it has something to say but it lacks the impact of, say, a Cry Freedom in its day. This is a classic case of preaching to the converted and allowing us all to feel good about ourselves because we agree with the message. I'm guessing it won't reach many die-hard KKK members and therefore will have no impact on the persisting issues.\n\nBut there are plenty of high points, not least of all Jessica Chastain who is rapidly becoming one of my FAIDs (Five Allowed In Dreamtime \u2013 more on that in a later post) along with her unofficial sibling (is it only me who sees it?), Kelly Reilly. Her turn as Celia Foote is huggably engaging but, alas, she plays little more than light relief to the weightier roles Aibileen, Skeeter and Hilly. Viola Davis is sincere in her portrayal of Aibileen, the matriarch of her community, and the focal point for those handing out gongs but for me this is an ensemble piece and I don't think any actor stands out as more deserving than another. Although it may earn gold, it doesn't have gold written across it and I'll hark back to my comment about Driving Miss Daisy.\n\nEmma Stone is not the Skeeter I imagined as I read the book and she's coasting here, well below the quality and impact she previously promised in Easy A and even Zombieland. Alison Janney, yet again, enhances the group effort and Sissy Spacey has fun in a pantomime cameo.\n\nMuch of the story is abbreviated for pace but the biggest cause of irritation comes at the end credits in the form of Mary J. Blige's horribly jarring song, The Living Proof, that is saccharine pulp and both too modern and too twee for a film that, despite it's lightweight failings, is a film worth spending a tenner and a couple of hours on.\n\nIt's good. It's very enjoyable. It'll make you feel good about yourself for being on the side of justice. But it's a little like eating an entire loaf of white Mother's Pride toast with marmalade; it goes down perfectly but sometime after the event you'll realize there was no substance to it and you require something more, well, real. This year it earns four stars from me but I expect, if you ask me to watch it again in five years, I'll settle on three."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Help\" is a film set in the 1960s just as the Civil Rights movement is taking off. Skeeter (Emma Stone) returns to her home town in Mississippi after college, desiring to become a writer. Shocked by the way some of the women treat their Afro-American maids, Skeeter decides to write a book from the viewpoint of the maids. Her family had a maid who basically raised her, Constantine (Cicely Tyson), but she's left the family, and Skeeter is unable to find out anything about why or what happened to her.\n\nThe first housekeeper to open up is Aibileen (Viola Davis) and eventually more women join in. And it's quite a story they have to tell. Little do they know, they are on the cusp of the Civil Rights movement. Change is coming.\n\nThe cast for this film is magnificent -- Bryce Dallas Howard is the nasty Hilly, Octavia Jackson plays a maid, Milly, who goes to work for Celia; Allison Janney is Skeeter's mother, Jessica Chastain is the heart-of-gold, rejected Celia, accused of breaking up a marriage. Every one of them creates a full character, and their acting is perfect. Both Howard and Stone step into a new category of acting expertise.\n\nCicely Tyson has a few very small scenes, and she nearly steals the film. It's her performance that will haunt you.\n\nAlso in the film are Sissy Spacek, Mary Steenburgen, Leslie Jordan, and Dana Ivey.\n\nThis film will make you laugh, make you angry, and finally make you cry. It catches the '60s atmosphere and also the varying attitudes of the southern women, many of whom are bigoted and condescending.\n\nUnfortunately the racial problems in this country have yet to be solved. I remember one black woman and her husband going to Buffalo, New York, and being amazed that they could walk into any restaurant and not be thrown out. Another friend's father became ill while they were traveling in the south. They went to a clinic - because her father was of Sicilian descent and had been in the sun, he was cared for on the black side. Being from the north, they had no idea there was a black and white side.\n\nWhen you think about how many of these people had to live their lives, the restrictions they lived under, the lack of opportunity, it's sobering.\n\nExcellent film, thought-provoking, and highly recommended."

        "review_detailed_main": "Over ten years later and The Help is still as touching and relevant as the day it came out. First, it should be noted that the Help is a fictional film based on Kathryn Stockett's 2009 novel by the same name. However, I don't think it makes the story any less relevant. The film follows an ambitious writer in the 1960s, who publishes a book with multiple stories of black maids' point of view on the white families for which they work, and the hardships they go through on a daily basis. While the stories are fictional, the situations feel very, and the characters are very relatable. In fact, some of these same issues, particularly the separation between the haves and have nots are still present in our society today. The cast is amazing, and there isn't a weak performance from anyone. Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Emma Stone, and Bryce Dallas Howard give some of their best work. Anna Camp even has a small role, and it is clear this was before she got famous. But she still plays her part excellently (there are also some really good deleted scenes with her in it on the DVD). The second thing is that this film is sometimes accused of perpetuating the idea of the white savior. To people who think that way, I would say that context is important and that the time this film takes place in, African American women didn't have the same opportunities as an upper-class white woman would have, and clearly, a movie set in 2011 would approach the subject matter differently. I will also say that there are times when people need to step in when they see inequalities in their society, and it doesn't matter what their race is as long as they are helping to create a better society for everyone. It's not a perfect film, but it's a must-watch for its subject matter alone. Because don't we all want to be told \"you is kind you is smart you is important\" ?"

It's an interesting perspective on the civil rights movement of the 1960's and especially on race relations in the state of Mississippi. It revolves around the writing of a book by Skeeter (Emma Stone) - an aspiring author largely raised by a black maid employed by her family who decides to write about what life is like as a black domestic servant in the City of Jackson. As we watch her write, and as she manages to get more and more of the stories of the various \"maids\" shared with her, we see the sadness and injustice of the southern lifestyle of the era. The \"maids\" were only slightly better off than the slaves who had come before them - at the whim of their \"employers,\" poorly paid and useful mainly because they allowed the women they worked for to enjoy a relative life of ease, not even having to take responsibility for the raising of their own children. There may have been a little too much caricature involved in that portrayal (although not having lived in Jackson, Mississippi in the '60's, I can't say for sure) but this certainly gives a taste of the era and the society. This isn't about marches or protests, although the killing of civil rights leader Medgar Evers earns a mention; it's a story about people and the struggles they faced overcoming a legacy of racism.\n\nAnd yet, while it's worthwhile (and even manages to tell a difficult story with a fair bit of humour thrown in) it also came across to me at least as lacking a real edge or focus. It needed something more to really draw me in. The stories offered an interesting vignette of southern life, but there wasn't enough of interest to really keep me glued to the film. In fact, throughout the last 30-45 minutes, I was mostly interested in how this was going to end, and frankly every time a new scene came up the thought that went through my head was \"there's more.\"\n\nI appreciated it. It made a point, and of course it had the requisite heart-wrenching ending (which, for this story, was very appropriate and not at all superfluous) but it needed something more; it actually needed a lot more for my tastes (although, on the subject of tastes, the story of Minnie's chocolate pie alone makes this movie definitely worth watching!)

The film demonstrates a side of the Jim Crow era at its worst in the south, and a young woman who was willing to unveil the sad depiction of live-in house maids and their short-lived bonds with the children they cared for.\n\nEmma Stone is impressive as the strong willed \"Skeeter\" who defiantly writes a book depicting the experiences of black maids in the south. Jessica Chastain is almost unrecognizable as the darling Celia Foote who adds an endearing character to an otherwise purposefully unlikeable cast of characters. Not to mention the phenomenal demonstration of strong will and friendship from Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer, who both received Oscar nominations for this movie, (With Octavia Spencer in fact, winning for best performance by an actress in a supporting role) and who inspired to have strength and hope through unbearable times. It is also hard to forget the malicious Hilly Holbrook played excellently by Bryce Dallas Howard that moviegoers will definitely love to hate.\n\nThe film does a great job of adapting the book to the big screen and is sure to make one feel a range of emotions. Although some may dislike the depiction of the mammy archetype in this film, it will not fall short in the entertainment aspect."

To think how much we have changed in the past 50 years is fascinating, no mobile phones (Imagine little old ladies, The Helps texting each other to avoid being caught by police), 'coloured' people segregated in society - however these days there still seems to be a divide in society if not written out as law, at least written out with the distribution of wealth.

The film is very message-heavy and sentimental to boot, and yet it makes for an engaging experience thanks to a slew of well developed characters brought to life by talented actresses. Octavia Spencer, Cicely Tyson and especially Viola Davis provide strong supporting turns as some of the poorly treated African American maids who in many cases care more about the kids whom they are helping to raise than the parents themselves. Emma Stone also delivers a fine turn as the protagonist who only gradually realises the seriousness of her endeavour, however, it is Jessica Chastain who steals the show as a ditzy young woman completely oblivious to how maids are usually treated and overly cordial when hiring one of her own. She has some strong dramatic moments late in the piece too. Sissy Spacek is also great as the mother of the vilest and most racist young woman in the film, but as the young lady herself, Bryce Dallas Howard is absolutely grating. She given no likable qualities at all and therefore makes for a rather flat antagonist, and many of the other young women in the film do not come across much better. The main characters of the film are relatable and down-to- earth though. This in turn renders their struggles in the face of inequality endlessly interesting - obvious and maudlin though the messages here may be."

        "review_detailed_main": "Directed by Tate Taylor in only his second full-length effort, this 2011 period film isn't perfect, but its precarious blend of gravitas, pathos and humor tugs at the heartstrings in a way that makes the story emotionally riveting without veering into the maudlin or being condescending, no small feat considering the ongoing temptations in Tate's fully ripened screenplay. Set in his hometown of Jackson, Mississippi, in 1961 just as the civil rights movement was taking hold of the Deep South, the film benefits immeasurably from its excellent cast, in particular, a gut-wrenching performance from Viola Davis, a brilliant actress who blazed through just eight minutes of screen time in John Patrick Shanley's \"Doubt\". Showing more nuanced shades of her trademark stoic strength here, she serves as the film's emotional center as Aibileen, a haunted middle-aged maid who has spent most of her life raising white children and just recently lost her only son to racially motivated violence.\n\nBased on fellow Jacksonian Kathryn Stockett's popular 2009 novel, this immensely satisfying adaptation faithfully covers most of the book's major plot points and fluidly shifts viewpoints between Aibileen; her sassy best friend Minny, who can't help but show her contempt for her racist employers; and Skeeter Phelan, a young white woman and recent college graduate who after moving back home, discovers that Constantine, the dedicated maid who helped raise her since childhood has mysteriously disappeared. The three women's stories intertwine seamlessly to explain how life in Jackson revolved around the co-existence of blacks and whites in a state of casual yet hostile intimacy. The symbol of institutionalized segregation is the bathroom, a firebrand issue led by Hilly Holbrook, the town's demonic debutante who is pushing to pass an ordinance to support her belief that all homes should have separate bathroom facilities for the \"colored\" help. This revelation makes Skeeter realize how deep the racial divide is in her town. Ambitious to become a serious writer, Skeeter pitches an idea to the publishing house of Harper & Row to write a book that would show her world from the black maids' perspectives, an idea fraught with danger to all who dare to participate. Spurred on by civil rights activist Medgar Evers' assassination in Jackson, the maids unify in their support of the book (a scene that reduced me to tears), and it becomes a big success but not without certain sacrifices.\n\nBeyond Davis' sterling turn, there is an embarrassment of acting riches - Octavia Spencer's tart-tongued turn as Minny threatens to steal the picture entirely, especially in a hilariously vengeful chocolate pie scene that almost belongs in a completely different movie; an extravagantly coiffed and costumed Bryce Dallas Howard, surprisingly effective as Hilly, the most venal and unrepentant of racists; Jessica Chastain in full-blown Marilyn mode as the white-trash wife ostracized by the bridge club set; Sissy Spacek easily stealing her brief comic scenes as Hilly's dotty mother fully aware of her daughter's character shortcomings; Allison Janney as Skeeter's acidic, status-conscious mother who proves it's never too late to change your ways; Cicely Tyson lending unforced dignity and an uncanny Jane Pittman countenance to the flashback scenes of Constantine; and smoky-voiced Emma Stone, who officially graduates from comic supporting roles and truly comes into her own as Skeeter. The whole cast deserves to be remembered during awards season. Not by accident, the men are given short shrift here. A more experienced filmmaker than Taylor could have instilled a greater sense of fearlessness in the movie's approach, although at the same time, few would be as generous with such an outstanding cast. Despite some moments that border on being too broad, the film represents superior entertainment about a period of American history that needs to be remembered."

Talk about courage and friendship, what an understatement. I couldn't imagine living back when people had such small minds but that's how it was. This movie was touching and very real, with a no hold back on feelings and the actors portraying them. Back to Bryce was amazingly cunning and bitchy while Emma was the sweetest but stood her ground! Sissy was hilarious in her small role that had a massive impact. Viola Davis drew me in and took me along for her ride of heartbreak and triumph. Oooohh don't forget Octavia Spencer, she was AMAZING! What a great story to show how the world has changed and continues to do so!"

Any guesses as to why.. every talent and casting agent will readily tell you. Guaranteed without one name attached, it does not come anywhere near as close (and her part in this production is limited). There's only a small number of names that incite you to search out what other work they would have done.. she is one. As for this film, she brought the audience to the table, and it is a very worthwhile experience for those who might not have gone there without her participation. The number of individuals labeling themselves 'actor' is huge... but those who are truly talented, in addition to being a full-fledged 'movie-star'... now that's a minuscule number."

The cinematography is dreary, the period is not persuasively rendered, the young actresses for the most part lack authority and seem to be playing dress up in their mother's clothing. The actors are not an effective ensemble; they seem to be acting in different time periods if not different films. The film's pace and structure as well as it's mixture of comedy and drama are of no help, and the film feels like a Lifetime Movie. Of the large cast only talented Viola Davis suggests a real person, and Octavia Spencer is funny and endearing though she's playing a type. Love Field and The Long Walk Home wore this theme into the ground leaving The Help in the dust."

        "review_title": "The Untold Story of African-American Maids Raising White Children in the South: The Best Film on the Subject Since \"The Long Walk Home\"",
        "review_detailed_main": "In American historic culture, we often think of race relations in terms of the civil rights protest marches of the 1960's and the work of Medgar Evers and Martin Luther King Jr. Behind the scenes and for many decades prior to the legislation signed by President Johnson in 1964, African-Americans and Southern Whites interacted within a societal infrastructure which was not often discussed. African-American hired \"help\" often raised the white children of southern aristocratic society. Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan is a young white woman raised by one of these African-Americans, Constantine Bates, whom she regards as the person who raised her. She decides to document the experiences of the maids when she finds out Constantine was fired by her family without her knowledge.\n\nAibileen Clark, played by Viola Davis in an Academy Award-caliber performance, is the first maid solicited by Skeeter. At first reluctant to share her thoughts and experiences, Clark eventually decides to reveal her story. Others follow, including Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer) who was once in the employ of Hilly Holbrook, the most racist and insensitive of the upstart white women. As Skeeter hears their stories, she finds a recurring theme of negative attitudes exhibited by the white women toward the Help, ranging from disrespect and discourtesy to racist contempt. At one point, Hilly tries to have legislation passed to require all households with hired help to have separate bathrooms for African-Americans.\n\nIronically, Celia Foote, the one white woman who was formerly among the \"poor white trash\" treats her new employee Minnie with respect and decency. But because of her background, Celia is shunned from the women's groups. At one point, she tries to visit the local women's bridge club, but the members hide inside the house, pretending they're not there. Eventually, she learns the hard way that prejudice can cut in either direction. Her employee Minnie becomes more than just the Help but a kind of mentor.\n\nDespite its marketing, \"the Help\" is not a comedy-drama. It really is a rather sobering look at stratified culture in Jackson, Mississippi in the early 1960's during the civil rights protests. The aristocratic mothers have hired African-Americans to care for their children and houses, but show little appreciation toward the people who are part of their lives. In several instances these children know the Help better than their white mothers. In a very poignant scene, a local Ladies Club made up of many of the young mothers has taken up a fund-raiser to help starving children in Africa. But they seem oblivious to the people in their own community who might benefit from their work. Even simply offering a kind word appears to be outside of their modus operandi. I guess the point is that no one in these families believes it's necessary, and so these prejudicial attitudes are passed from generation to generation. Unfortunately, when the white children become adults they don't necessarily have the same affection for those who raised them.\n\nNo question, one of the best films of 2011, with outstanding performances by all the leads and supporting cast. I believe there will be several Academy Award Nominations. While Emma Stone as Skeeter and Emma Howard as Hilly deserve high marks, Viola Davis and Cicely Tyson steal the show. Both exhibit very different persona's when they are in the midst of whites than when they are at home. This may be the best film of this subject since \"the Long Walk Home\"."

Add to this film the remaining exceptional performances by Emma Stone, Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain and you have a winner. The pacing was a little slow for such a long movie, but still beautifully written an acted. 8/10 from me!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I enjoyed \"The Help\" but for all the wrong reasons. I loved the high production values, the beautiful lighting, the shots of ripe agricultural fields in the Deep South. I especially loved the exquisite, tailor-fit, vintage, early 1960s dresses worn by the white actresses. I got a huge kick out of the over-the-top performances. Bryce Dallas Howard, though a living person, is every bit the Walt Disney cartoon villainess. You love hating her. You grimace when she cackles and you cackle as she reaches her inevitable, and utterly unbelievable, nightmare, revenge-dream-fantasy downfall. Howard should have won an academy award. Viola Davis, who radiates soul and depth and can make you cry just by walking into a room, is the deep, rich heart of this otherwise silly film. Octavia Spencer is adorable. She's as big-eyed and woebegone as a DW Griffith Gish sister. I have no idea why Emma Stone is the star. She can't act much and she isn't a drop dead beauty. Maybe she knows someone.\n\n\"The Help\" is about black-white relations in Mississippi in the early 1960s. Jim Crow Mississippi was a terrorist state. That sounds like an extremist statement; it is not. The Mississippi Sovereignty Commission planted spies in every nook and cranny of Mississippi life. It aided at least one assassin, Byron de la Beckwith, who murdered Medgar Evers. This deadly serious, tense, historic era is reduced, in \"The Help,\" to a very pretty soap opera featuring magical Negroes \u2013 a term used to describe black characters in mostly white films who exist only to provide a means for the main, white character to grow.\n\nYou notice immediately in \"The Help\" that the white women are all slim, elegantly and flatteringly dressed, and pretty. The black women are plump, older, and plain. But, this is an uplifting film about Civil Rights, so all the black women are noble, giving, selfless, and saintly, while all, except one, of the whites are vicious, vacuous, selfish, and bad mothers. Also, all the whites are filthy rich. Was it really that way, you have to ask? No, it wasn't. Mississippi has one of the highest white poverty rates in the US. And some whites joined the Civil Rights struggle, performing the ultimate sacrifice, and giving their own lives. Still waiting for a feature film about Viola Liuzzo.\n\nMaybe it's not such a bad thing that simplistic and overtly exploitative movies like this get made. If they interest any viewers in the Civil Rights movement, that's not a bad thing. Maybe it will inspire some to see a truly worthy film series, \"Eyes on the Prize.\""

Its wonderful how she carries the loss of her son in every scene.\n\nI am a big Jessica Chastain fan and she doesnt disappoint. But I did not understand the background of this character as to why she is excluded by the ladies of her generation and no one wants to work for her.\n\nCertain parts in the story also were not clear. Maybe the book throws more lights. Why is Skeeter so open minded despite coming from the same background as rest? Why is the Hilly so racist when her own mother seems open minded?\n\nAgain Johnny seems more accepting than his male peers.\n\nMost of these women can read and write, was this the only option available to them.\n\nMore than racism, the movie is more on class distinction which still exists in all societies and countries."

I could be wrong. Maybe it just didn't seem as sappy in the book.\n\nI also thought the movie actually minimized the attitude that whites had toward blacks by making it seem like the racism in Jackson came from mean-spirited people like Hilly, as if it wasn't rampant among everyone.\n\nThe whole pie-eating thing trivialized what the maids went through and how they must have retaliated at times. It was too over-the-top in the movie and too much emphasis was put on it to the detriment of other parts of the story that would have rounded it out better.\n\nIf you're on the fence on whether or not to see the movie, do yourself a favor and read the book. It might take a little longer, but it will be a more satisfying experience."

These children in one generation spoke Gaelic, wore Irish clothing and had Irish attitudes. They became Gaelic lords. The Fitzgeralds of Kerry were an example. \"Skeeter\" was a result of such upbringing and did not become as obnoxious as her parents and their friends. The little girl featured with Viola Davis's character called her her real mother. At Monticello, a docent spoke with what I can only describe as a Black dialect. Because Blacks were kept away from education, the dialect was almost incomprehensible. My friend from West Virginia said, \"It's because they had Black nannies.\" So I found that part of \"The Help\" totally believable. It's a novel but novels often reveal the real feel of a situation. Perhaps it was superficial, broad, not intense like Shamaylian or Hitchcock. But Hilly scared the hell out of me. Even in Queens County New York, teenage counsellors at a day camp could urge the Black kids to leave the bus in the afternoon by saying, \"Bongo Muchacha, Water Boy Number One, Booga Booga,\" or the like. In the late 1950's. Maybe that is why so many baby boomers were at this movie. We all experienced the blindness. And the respect for certain loudmouths who could intimidate a kid into silence."

I felt that, though this works well and gives the film depth, sometimes it gets a little too obvious and makes it falls into the sentimental, tear- jerking territory. It's not like it bothered me, because it didn't, but I just thought it could have been handled a little more subtly. But hey, Disney's involved in it, so what did we expect?\n\nThe strong point of the film is the female cast. The actresses are perfect in their roles and they truly shine throughout the film. Emma Stone, as Skeeter, brings really well the modernity and the wit her character requires and Bryce Dallas Howard, though a little \"cartoonish\" sometimes as the evil and despicable Hilly Holbrook (which is understandable) really delivers too. But I found the following three performances even better:\n\nViola Davis, as the suffered Aibileen, does great in the most heart- breaking scenes and shows once more what a good actress she is, after her short but top-notch role in Doubt, where she outshone everyone (even Meryl Streep!). In spite of this, I'm having a little problem about her being considered the lead for all the awards. Though she's one of the centers of the film, she is missing in a big part of it.\n\nSecondly, we got Octavia Spencer, as the sassy Minny Jackson. It's true that hers is not a difficult role to play, but she's really really funny and one of the best parts of the film.\n\nAnd last but not least, the wonderful Jessica Chastain. Her Celia Foote could have easily been played as an over-the-top, one-dimensional bimbo, but she brings a depth and humanity that make her character the most endearing and likable in the film, in my opinion. I enjoyed her scenes with Minny the best.\n\nOverall, \"The Help\" is a perfectly enjoyable film, with amazing performances and an interesting storyline. It doesn't get tiresome at all, despite its considerable length, so I really recommend it. Regarding the Oscars, though, I do not think it should win best picture, but I'd be happy if one of the ladies took home the award, which seems likely."

We were not rich, very much not, but my Mom had a made I think once or twice a week and Gertrude kept us whenever Mom and Dad went out. We loved her. She told us funny stories, rocked us and tucked us in. We were always kind to her. I never knew about this side of her life ... I was a child and not aware.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Help\", critically and commercially praised as \"extraordinary\" and \"sensational\", was a film that I felt must be overrated. What a surprise to find that \"The Help\", written and directed by new-comer Tate Taylor, is hardly exaggerated, and happens to be THAT funny and THAT feel-good.\n\nEmma Stone brings her classic heart and spunky pizazz to a character that, without an actors touch, could have been overtly dull. And though it is Viola Davis who appears to be getting all of the critic's love, I think that it is Octavia Spencer who really pulls her weight in the film. Not only does she consistently remain side-splitting hilarious, but she captures a passion the film is lacking in the help department. (This is no way means Davis didn't use her acting-chops with elegance, simply that she was not the break-out maid).\n\nAs Jessica Chastain's second (of many) film in 2011, she manages to still be youthfully tender and jubilant; who could have predicted this same time last year that Chastain would hypnotize audiences and command the screen? Who could have guessed that Bryce Dallas Howard would continually make a splash as the \"bad\" one? Certainly not me, and I'm sure not many of you either. But here I sit, and here you read: unable to help but smile thinking about \"The Help\" and all of the subtle and vibrant performances that litter this years only film with a predominantly female cast. A film that makes women proud to be where they are, who they are and gives us all that little bit of courage we were missing previously.\n\nThe only facet of this deliciously well-composed film that fell-flat was the \"romantic-interest\" of Stone's character Skeeter. It's always nice to have a good man for a strong leading-woman, but one who is so unnecessary and, frankly, boring has no place in a film as flamboyant and thought-provoking as \"The Help\". A fatal writing flaw that ruined the film's masterful quality and intense shining excellence.\n\nA must see of 2011, and surefire Oscar bait."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'll give \"The Help\" 10 stars for the Women. Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Jessica Chastain, Cicely Tyson (playing old, old, old yet again) are thrilling to watch. They have the all out fierceness that makes movies like \"The Help\" enjoyable and seem to give them \"weight\". One wishes the film makers trusted these Women more and let them have more screen time. When Emma Stone's Skeeter finally gets Viola Davis' Aibileen to talk to her for a book she's writing about the experiences of black women who serve as housemaids and nannies in assorted white households in Jackson Mississippi circa 1963, Aibileen very tentatively begins by relating a story of the first child she took care of as a 14 year old in 1925. The way Davis speaks it, the story sounds fascinating and I wanted to hear all the details. But the director cuts away the scene to where Aibileen and Skeeter are done with their talk and we never hear all about Aibileen's story. The movie could have done with a lot more of the real stories about these women's lives but we only get bits and pieces. We really don't get to know a whole lot about them and that's a shame. We might think we get more but that is because these actresses are so damn good that we fill in the gaps ourselves.\n\nI'll give the \"The Help\" one star for what is gets wrong and it's not the first to do so. The film once again focuses too much time on the oh-so-helpful-wizened-white person role this time played by Emma Stone as Skeeter. She's one in a long line of actors who've played this part. Coincidentally (or maybe not) Sissy Spacek (a bit horrifying here in an old lady role. She's only 62!) played this role once in a movie called \"The Long Walk Home\". I assume that the money behind this film felt that in order to get white audiences interested, they had to keep this legacy going. While I think it's OK to have this kind of role, the film makers once again my the role pretty much the central character but they try and circumvent this by having Viola Davis' Aibileen narrate the picture (though this narration seems to be absent throughout long stretches of the film). It's insulting to the main characters in the film (\"The Help\" of the film's title) and diminishes from some of the meaning the film has. The rest of the white cast ranges from barely adequate/watchable (Spacek) to eye rolling caricature (Bryce Dallas Howard's Hilly Holbrook). The least said about Howard's character the better.\n\nI'll recommend \"The Help\" based solely on the African-American actresses (and Chastain as the only white character with some depth of feeling that seemed genuine). The rest is filler that we've seen before and can do without."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am far from this films target audience. Most films that center around racial prejudice such as Crash, The Blind Side, or Remember The Titans tend to simplify the issue and tend to have the feeling of a T.V. movie or a class lesson video, so I don't usually hold them that high in regard. Which is why I was shocked at how much I ended up liking this film.\n\nThe films plot centers around an aspiring journalist (played by Emma Stone) trying to write a book of stories about the lives of black maids working for rich, white families in Jackson, Mississippi during the civil rights movement. As such, it has the common themes of family, prejudice, acceptance, and understanding seen in these sort of films. The thing that sets it apart is the story and characters are generally well written. Everyone has well defined characters, even if some of them are a bit clich\u00e9, and they all act and react the way there personalities say they would. You can actually see these people existing in the real world, which allows you to connect with them much easier. As much of a trope as the stay-at- home, airhead 50's housewife is, I find it pretty entertaining, especially when such characters are fleshed out and interact with each other.\n\nOn top of that, the film understands when to let the audience laugh. Even though it is mainly a drama, the humor in feels very genuine and constant, even if it can be a bit sit- com like at times. This is what separates it from films like Crash as it doesn't let the message drag the movie down and make it depressing. Also unlike Crash, The Help doesn't talk down to the audience. It gets it point across just through the flow of the story, without having to resort to dropping a giant anvil marked \"racism is bad\" on your head. It shows that there is more to racism than just hate. It can also come from societal pressure or be taught from birth. The movie respects your intelligence, and that's a rare thing to find in films these days.\n\nThe film gives you drama and a few laughs and treats its subject matter with care. The characters are well written and well acted. To top it all off, you got a soundtrack that has Johnny Cash, Bo Diddley, and even a little Bob Dylan. What's not to like. Consider this a strong recommendation."

From there, the film gives us to know moments in the life of these servants and we see that, in spite of their humility, they're essential for those families, where women have the appearance of not even knowing fry an egg. The cast fulfills its mission very well but without surprise us with supreme interpretations. The only exception is Octavia Spencer, who touches us and moves us in the role of Minny, justly deserving the single Oscar that the film won: Best Supporting Actress.\n\nOur society often doesn't hear the voices of most humble.

        "review_title": "\"The Help\" addresses the heavy theme of racial segregation but the theme is superficially contextualized and the focus is wrongly in the white characters most of the times",
        "review_detailed_main": "Based on the book \"The Help\" by Kathryn Stockett and written and directed by Tate Taylor in 2011, \"The Help\" takes place in Mississippi in the 1960s and follows the story of Skeeter (Emma Stone), a young woman who has just finished college. And dreams of being a writer. She turns the city upside down when she decides to research and interview black women who have always taken care of \"Southern families\". Despite the confusion caused, Skeeter gets the support of Aibileen (Viola Davis), a friend's housekeeper, who gains the trust of other women who have a lot to tell. However, relationships are forged and brotherhoods emerge amidst the need that many have to say before the changing times hit everyone.\n\nThe strong point of the film is not the denunciation of the mistreatment of blacks, nor the fight for civil rights, or even the search for female overcoming (as writers, housewives or wives). In a very intelligent way, director and screenwriter Tate Taylor does not shy away from these themes, but he does not use them as the sole motivation for the film either. Instead, the film has a lighter tone, often even comical, and seeks to bring us closer to the characters, to immerse ourselves in the adventure with them. This could be considered a form of cowardice on the part of Taylor (who is a childhood friend of the author of the eponymous bestseller), but the truth is that this decision contributes a lot to the identification and originality of the film, without preventing the important message be transmitted. It is therefore natural that the spectator becomes deeply involved with the characters and that the story starts to have an intimate relationship with us, and not just a denunciation.\n\nFrom a technical point of view, The Help is impeccable: Mark Ricker's production design and Sharen Davis's costumes do an admirable job of recreating the period while effectively contrasting the spacious comforts of employers' homes with the oppressive misery of the maids' hovels, opposing, on the other hand, the sterility of the former and the pleasant family feeling awakened by the latter. In addition, the locations that reveal large properties surrounded by vast lands suggest a lifestyle closer to the slave trade period, pre-Civil War, than to a modern society about to send the first man to the Moon.\n\nBecause, as unbelievable as it may seem, it wasn't long ago that racial intolerance came to be seen as something pernicious by society - suffice it to say that, less than 30 years ago, marriage between whites and blacks was still prohibited by law in some US states. Thus, when we see a boss impolitely ordering his maid to make him a sandwich, or a mistress demonstrating repugnance at the idea of seeing her maid using her bathroom, we feel simultaneous shocks caused by the stupidity of those actions and by recognizing that, even today, there are people who see others as inferior just because of their color - and, as in the film, it is not uncommon to witness bosses who refer to their employees in a pejorative way as if these, who are beside them, were invisible or deaf.\n\nFeaturing a superb performance by Viola Davis, \"The Help\" is almost saved thanks to the actress's sensitivity, which displays, in small gestures and breathing changes, an infinity of complex and painful feelings - and notice how she almost gasps while gets ready to start narrating his stories to Skeeter or how his hands shake when welcoming the journalist into his home, since he had never had a white guest in his home. It is she who unnecessarily narrates the story. She is the one from whom we should hear more stories about her profession, which she has been practicing since she was 14 years old. But Tate Taylor's eagerness to return to the wealthy suburbs and show off more jokes keeps audiences from identifying even more with the character. The precipitated death of her son is the only personal fact that she fully recounts.\n\nMoreover, the feature moderately displays the passivity of this dedicated maid, which would not be so true if played by an actress other than Davis. The expressiveness of this belatedly discovered talent makes magic with so little that is given to it. However, to realize the richness of her performance, it is enough to contrast her with the caricature created by Octavia Spencer, whose Minny oscillates between two modes, \"angry\" and \"funny\", constantly combining them to achieve a greater comic effect - and the result is that, even suffering physical abuse from her husband, the character's drama never really gains weight.\n\nBut the film's biggest problem, however, is that, although its story is essentially about the living conditions of black housemaids and these are its most interesting characters (even Minny), the film insists on investing most of its narrative in the core of white socialites and their \"problems\", starting with Celia (the beautiful Jessica Chastain, from \"The Tree of Life\"), who suffers from not being accepted by her classmates, and ending with the protagonist, Skeeter, who dreams of being a journalist and grew up thinking she was ugly and inadequate due to the pressures exerted by her mother. Incidentally, the white characters in Taylor's script are basically divided into two groups: the pure-hearted ones, who embrace the maids and treat them as equals, and the despicable villains, who do everything to humiliate them (and to make it even worse). Of course, the terrible woman played by Bryce Dallas Howard even develops a sore on her face, and it is notable that the director has restrained his own impulse to put a witch wart on his nose). The maids, on the other hand, are invariably stoic creatures and owners of ancient wisdom - and even their most reprehensible actions appear as perfectly justifiable reactions to the villainy of their employers.\n\nAs exclusionary as its real main characters (the exception is Skeeter), Tate Taylor's script is a complete contradiction, going so far as to only mention the domestic aggression experienced by Minny (Octavia Spencer), one of the maids, while the repercussions about a controversial chocolate pie served to Hilly goes on for several unnecessary minutes. These erroneous options end up making the film not become an apology, which gives blacks the space they always lacked, but an act of revenge against whites. But what is most sickening about \"The Help\" is how, at the end of the day, it is white people who come to the aid of poor, powerless black people, saving the day with their kindness - and, believe it or not, the simple fact that the housewife played by Jessica Chastain preparing a meal for Minny leads the latter to finally work up the courage to stand up to her husband.\n\nLikewise, the film's discussion of racism is more about the changes experienced by the Caucasian affluent (Skeeter's mother got well all of a sudden! Oh!) than about the actual suffering of the oppressed black class, which at the very least reveals the concern filmmaker - white, of course - to the effects of it all on his fellow racers. In fact, it is unbelievable that Taylor not only wrote, but rehearsed, filmed and kept in the final editing a scene as artificial as the one that shows Skeeter's mother firing a maid who has worked in her house for 30 years just to see herself momentarily. Pressured by high society friends. But what to expect from a guy who, from the third act on, seems to simply throw any sign of subtlety in the air and decides to dedicate himself exclusively to the purpose of drawing tears from the spectator? And how he tries to do it: in a matter of minutes, we have the old scene that shows several characters getting up while offering support to someone (\"I'll help!\", \"Me too!\", \"Count on me!\"), another that it follows a character being applauded by dozens of people and exchanging meaningful nods with a friend; and, of course, a child crying and banging on a window glass when he sees someone leaving.\n\n\"The Help\" stands out for its great interpretations. The screenplay is sometimes shallow, unable to escape the didacticism of emotion or laughter at certain times and of superficial and one-dimensional characters. It survives through the deep interpretations of the cast, aware that the secret to the film's success was to make the characters real and close to the public's daily life. Thus, even with the white bosses looking like shrews, or completely good as in the case of Celia, in an unnecessary Manichaeism between conservatives and liberals, the women (the male figure is almost non-existent) become convincing thanks to the interpreters. The screenplay, moreover, contains little-needed subplots, such as Celia Foote's pregnancy and Skeeter's relationship. They only serve to illustrate behaviors of the time (the woman who cannot give her husband a child or the independent woman pressured by her mother). Little to the possible social drama.\n\nThe problem is that \"The Help\" addresses the heavy theme of racial segregation in the extremely conversational Mississippi, but does not give up on being a \"feel-good movie\". The region was the birthplace of the Ku Klux Klan - an organization that violently persecuted blacks -, but the theme is superficially contextualized, as well as the quick references to Martin Luther King. That is, any political issue is thrown into space, even with the motto being the desire of journalist Skeeter to, for the first time, tell the story of those who were marginalized by society. The work of the cast (almost completely female), by the way, saves \"The Help\" from tragedy. From the top of their caricatures, they are still able to arouse viewers' empathy. The various dialogues in Taylor's script, as well as his measured direction with some rhythm, allow for such a highlight. Too bad they are all in favor of a technically well-finished work, but narratively failed, which gives a voice to those who already had it, displaying an embarrassing veiled prejudice."

So I have to ask myself if I'm ready to be angry. If the answer is no, I move on. If the answer is yes, I strap in for the show.\n\n\"The Help\" delivered on the anger inducing as I expected, but it delivered on being a quality movie as well, as I expected. The help in this movie were, of course, African-Americans working in service roles, but it focused on Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) and Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer). They, along with other housekeepers/nannies/servants were the subject of a book being written by Skeeter Phelan (Emma Stone). Her book was stories of being a servant from the perspective of the help.\n\nThe movie is based upon a book by Kathryn Stockett. It succeeds in showing the racism of Mississippi without showing lynchings, murders, or beatings. In fact, for the most part, there's not any violence at all. What we see is a more passive form of racism and oppression from the aristocratic women of Jackson, Mississippi. It came in subtler forms such as making them use separate bathrooms, treating them with disrespect and contempt, and denying them simple dignities.\n\nWhere the movie fails is putting a spotlight on its protagonist Skeeter. Her character gets a total pass because she's seen as someone who's an ally of the help, yet she also exhibits an even subtler more patronizing form of racism. Her own nanny was fired by her mother and she sheds tears because of it. She sheds those tears more for herself than for her nanny Constantine (Cicely Tyson). She'd lost her mother figure, yet that caused her to cry out, \"She needs my help!\" as though Constantine wouldn't be able to survive without her. Fortunately, the Constantine saga wasn't dwelled upon.\n\n\"The Help\" was still a moving film that deserves the praise it's gotten. It was a slow paced, yet engaging movie that allowed for character development in a natural, unforced manner. It showed the trials and tribulations of Black women in the south while also showing their strength. A movie like this was an inevitability. Who would have the best gossip other than the servants who were around all of the time? And who had the most motivation to expose those secrets? Oh yeah, this movie was going to happen, it was just a matter of what form it would take."

Emma Stone is a fun character and seems really genuine with the interviewees. Viola Davis (who plays Abileine, a maid) is an amazing actor making the film more realistic. In summary, I would recommend this film to those who are interested in historical films as well as people who enjoy Emma Stone as an actor."

I used to get through the reviews before watching a movie of this genre and mostly wasted my time and money after reading some big-mouths except just a few titles like Hotel Rwanda and American History X. In my personal opinion, I would rate The Help much higher than American History X.\n\nWonderful performances by Octavia Spencer, Viola Davis, Bryce Dallas Howard, Emma Stone and Cicely Tyson (All female-female as the story centered to). I believe nobody can see it without some cries and laughs simultaneously (especially if you see it alone as we turned cautious in crowd or theaters). Its all about the hard-work in building the characters that you would take it as real as it happens around you, even you are thousand miles away from the community where it happens.\n\nThis is an important time in our community. Why I would pick this line as summary? Racism issues are every where in this era of Globalisation. What we need, is to tolerate and respect each other or we would be eating each other's ... like Hilly. Humanity is above all."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Oscar season\", as it's typically referred to, is a period of time, usually beginning in late November, and ending in late January. This year, it starts early, with The Help.\n\n\"The Help\" is based on the well-known novel by Kathryn Stockett, someone who I had never heard of before discovering this film and book. For the most part, when I hear about a film that I want to see, I try to read the book prior to viewing the movie, to enhance the whole experience. Usually I get bored, or stop mid-way through one of these said books, before I end up watching the movie.\n\nBut \"The Help\" grabbed me. Stockett kept me on a leash, dying to know what happened next, and I ended up finishing its 530 pages in a few sittings. And, I'm glad it did, because \"The Help\" is not only the best movie I've seen this summer, but it very well could be the best one I see all year.\n\nThe film centers on Aibileen, Skeeter and Minny (Davis, Stone and Spencer, respectively) three very different women in Mississippi, in the year 1962. Skeeter is returning from graduating college with a journalism degree, whose beloved childhood black maid Constantine has disappeared, and no one will tell her where she has gone. Aibileen is a maid who has raised 17 white children in her life. Her outspoken friend Minny has never been able to keep quiet, or, because of this, hold onto a job very long. Skeeter decides to write a tell-all book of interviews from the maids of Jackson, Mississippi, which, as you could imagine, was a very taboo thing in that time and place.\n\nOne of the reasons that this film succeeds is that not a single character is miscast. In the book, Stockett paints a vivid picture of each character, and the actors clearly got lost in the characters they were playing. Emma Stone is becoming a very important actress. I haven't seen her in a role that I didn't love her in. After getting her first notable role in 2009's Zombieland, and then livening and carrying the otherwise bland teen comedy Easy A, this is her first dramatic role, as Skeeter, one of the lead characters. While she sometimes blends into the background in this movie, she shines beautifully with the rest of the cast. She's definitely one to watch.\n\nWhile Stone is great, this movie belongs to Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer. Davis's Aibileen is perfect. She has a silent sadness about her, a lot of pride, and a great sense of anger, while never raising her voice the whole film. She handles emotional scenes beautifully, reducing the audience to tears in more than one scene. She's a early in the year front-runner for Best Actress this Oscar season.\n\nSpencer also does a beautiful job as Minny. Octavia Spencer was the original inspiration for the character of Minny, who voiced the character's section in the audio-book. She was clearly made to play this role. She does a lot more for this movie, than just adding comic relief, but she plays the comedic side the best. The \"terrible awful\" that her character does in the book, is made into the funniest thing in the whole movie.\n\nThe supporting cast is dead-on too. Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron's daughter) plays the town's snobby ringleader, Hilly. She's absolutely chilling, nailing the evil character. Her mother, played by Sissy Spacek is a hoot. The town's secretive lush, and Minny's boss, Celia, is played by newcomer Jessica Chastain, who wowed earlier this year in \"The Tree of Life\". She was completely like I envisioned her character in the book. There's not enough typing space in this review to describe how much I loved the rest of the supporting cast. Everyone was dead-on.\n\nI was under the assumption that this would be yet another disappointing film of a book loved by many. The reason for this was the director and writer. I had never heard of this Tate Taylor, and because of that, I wasn't sure that I trusted him. He had a large part in making this movie all that it was. One of the big reasons that \"The Help\" works as a movie is because it feels authentic. It was filmed in Mississippi, where it's based, it is set in the 1960's, and every feeling about the movie hits the right note.\n\nI later discovered that Taylor was a childhood friend of the book's author. Not some Hollywood hack. I forget the many disappointing film adaptations of books I loved that were made by the Hollywood elite. \"The Da Vinci Code\" by Ron Howard, \"Memoirs of a Geisha\" by Rob Marshall, \"Eat, Pray, Love\" by Ryan Murphy. Enough said. After seeing this film, I couldn't imagine anyone better-suited to making the film.\n\nWhat is special about this film is that it is not what a lot of people will probably write it off as. It is not a film to make white audiences feel less white guilt. It avoids this sentimentality, I don't know how, but it succeeds in that, like I thought it wouldn't.\n\nWhile some changes are (intelligently) made from the book, it's almost a scene-for-scene adaptation of the book. Some things are different, because they need to be, and things are a little more concise, yet it's almost like watching an abridged version of the book, on screen. I can't say enough good things about this film."

The pacing was uneven and runtime could have been easily shortened. Other than that it was a nice watch.\n\nI read that many black people criticized saying that movie is told from white perspective but I don't see any problem there. At least they didn't try to whitewash them.\n\nOverall, it was a good movie which everyone should give a try."

The help helped me smile.. The help helped me laugh.. The help helped me had my eyes wet and still feel happy.. beautiful movie to watch and enjoy and maybe relate to it in lot of ways.. you don't need to belong to certain caste or religion or belief to enjoy a movie like The Help.. or have to have suffered or lived or living through the same situation as the characters in the film.. For me its a movie about Hope.. better tomorrow.. its about believing.. It just helps you to get drawn into believing for a better tomorrow.. still need couple of lines to get it on.. if you have checked out the movie and still not watched it.. well just go for it.. The 2hrs you spend watching this film is worthwhile.."

I have now watched this movie two times and have decided there are two ways to watch the film. One way is you can watch the film by seeing it as a cute story about black and whites becoming friends during a time of inequality and oppression. There are plenty laughable parts of the movie making it light hearted and a feel good movie for the weekend. Another way to watch the movie is by looking at the more complex issues of the movie. This movie is set during a time when there was not equality. Not only were black people oppressed, but so were women. This movie focuses on both black and white women and the struggles they faced living in a society dominated by white males. The fear, hopelessness, and courage shown in this movie illustrates the times of the Civil Rights movement when so many black people were afraid yet felt the need to fight for a better future. There are plenty complex issues of feminism, racial injustice, and relationship struggles introduced in this movie making it very meaningful. However, the comedy, amazing acting, and outrageous characters makes this a movie accessible and enjoyable even to those of us who are not history buffs. I would recommend watching this movie!"

The perspective of the book (Skeeter's) was changed to be the perspective of the maids, mainly Aibileen and Minny. I felt Skeeter was reduced to a bi-stander and not the driver of collecting the interviews and writing the book as in the original text. Take the story of Skeeter and Stuart. It had been cut down so it did not make any sense why he was so gloomy, drinking to much.\n\nI urge you all, movie audience and the film makers, to read the book!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is the first time in my life I have ever liked the movie version better than the book. I finished the book the night before seeing the movie. The book left a lot of unanswered story lines, and it also left Hilly on top, with no one really telling her what a piece of trash she really is. The film does an excellent job of incorporating a majority of the book, while adding two scenes where Hilly finally has someone tell her what an a$$hole she really is. I rank the movie a 9 out of 10 because it really is almost perfect. It has Emma Stone as Skeeter trying to break out as a writer by tackling the hot button topic of segregation from the view point of the help. Both supporting characters-Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer-carry the wisdom and truly make you question how racist morons in the south as high up as the governor were able to reign supreme for so long. Skeeter's mother-Allison Janney-lit up the screen. She is the souther belle that has also been dealt a pretty harsh case of cancer that has left her losing her hair and her speed, but she still pushes for the best for her little girl, and in the end proves to be proud of her daughter for being such a courageous writer and human being. Now we have Hilly Holbrook-Bryce Dallas Howard-the villain of the film. I LOVED her in this role. The very sight of her on screen turned my stomach every time. She is a self proclaimed Christian southern belle, but is in reality an ignorant racist that enjoys controlling all her friends and pretty much everything in her life and everyone else's life. She enjoys treating the help terribly, it appears to genuinely make her happy. This is where the book failed terribly. The book had Hilly come out on top, with no one ever really giving it to her. The movie is redeeming, and I cried numerous times throughout. I see numerous Oscar nominations in its future."

With help from leading actresses Viola Davis, Emma Stone, and Allison Janney; these women did an incredible job making the Mississippi, Southern style of life come alive. The movie explains the relationships between African American maids during the 1960s and their families they provided for. With constant care taking, daily routines and chores many of the maids went about their lives saying very few words to the white folks. When Miss Skeeter Phelan, a University grad with a passion for writing, comes back to town, she stirs up a hot pot of drama. Persuading the maids to tell-all about their unspoken stories and redemption towards white families they have worked for, may have sounded like a good idea at the time. Lets just say that some thoughts are better off not spoken. The passion and friendship Skeeter shows towards these women is truly touching and heart-warming. This movie shows how the determination of one person can change the lives of many. At some point everyone is forced to make the choice of either staying with or breaking the status quo. The light humor and strong Southern accents will definitely keep you intrigued throughout the entire movie. The Help is a must see."

When I sat in the theater, I was expecting to see the wanna-be inspiring story of a girl that writes a book where colored people express themselves and wicked witch is up to no good. Well, if you are expecting to see this, and have not even bothered to watch it, don't you freaking dare to keep thinking the same thought, because I was wrong as soon as I left the theater! From beginning to end, The Help is a jaw-dropping story that encourages us to keep on with life!\n\nGreat actors are present such as Bryce Dallas Howard's sensation evil role as Hilly and Viola Davis' heart-warming and perfected role as Aibileen. When I left the theater, I was literally paralized because of its complexity and filling with tears, despite the fact I am a man. The Help is a must-see and I am morally and extremely positive I am voting for them, for every Oscar there can be for these!"

The range of emotions I experienced can be credited to not only the excellence of the story writing but the quality of the acting and the personality of the actors chosen to portray each role. I especially appreciated that the focus was to develop the characters of the maids as opposed to the white ladies that they worked for. This allows for a consistency between the main character's goal to write from the Negro perspective and the goal of the film itself. Unfortunately, it seems that some critics think that this film and storyline are not realistic. It has been criticized for simplifying the complex race relations and omitting the various forms of violence that characterize the time period."

As I watched I kept drifting back to small-town South Carolina in the 1950s, where I grew up. It was moving and disturbing to be reminded how black people were treated then--loved and yet \"kept down in their place.\" Our neighborhood was all middle-class and every family had a maid. There were plenty of boys my age, we visited in each other's homes, and called every maid by her first name. One even started a baseball team for the little white boys, for which her reward was a visit by the Klan.\n\nOur maid helped my mother cook and clean. One of my parents picked her up and took her home every day--and she rode in the back seat. She ate her lunch in our kitchen--without being allowed to use our utensils. I remember her eating with her fingers. I do not remember ever seeing her use our bathrooms. I thought about that during the movie and truly cannot recall what she did, an embarrassing gap in memory.\n\nI do remember when my father was out of work and our maid had to be cut back to three days a week. I actually cried; she was a member of our family. When talk about civil rights began in the late 1950s, my mother became annoyed at our maid for getting \"uppity.\" And so it went. We moved to central Florida in 1961, where there were no maids.\n\nTravel back in time with this film. It's quite real, and I highly recommend it."

For the first time in a major film, the focus is on how white women treated black women during the era of Jim Crow. Rather than another harrowing portrayal of the horrors of racism involving white men treating black men badly, very badly, we see something that is every bit as disturbing. White women, many of them, degrading and demeaning black women, many of them, in so many small and cruel ways that it makes you ashamed. Much of it is painful to watch, and it's mostly done with soul-killing looks and words, very ugly words. All of the insults, dirty looks, callous remarks...it's a shocking reminder about the banality of evil. Amazing performances. Hope it's shown in every high school in America."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Help\" is about black women being employed as maids and nannies in Jackson, Mississippi back in the racially-tense early 1960s.\n\nSkeeter Phelan (Emma Stone) is an independent tomboyish young lady who could not help but notice how badly her bridge buddies were treating their black maids. This terrible racist attitude was most exemplified by the pretty but contemptible Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard), who was not even shy about her nasty behavior. Skeeter then secretly interviews maids Aibilene Clark (a serious Viola Davis) and Minny Jackson (a sassy Octavia Spencer), who bravely tell Skeeter their stories of oppression in white homes. How will the town react when Skeeter's book finally gets published?\n\nThe movie is another example of excellent ensemble acting. Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer have the showiest roles. Spencer, in particular, figures in the most memorable scene about how her Milly character gets back at Hilly using a pie. Emma Stone is also quite good as the modern thinking Skeeter. Jessica Chastain sparkles as Celia Foote, a naive housewife from the poor side of town who was ostracized by Hilly and her friends. The more minor characters of Sissy Spacek (as Hilly's mom) and Allison Janney (as Skeeter's mom) also make their mark despite their shorter screen time. Cicely Tyson has a memorable moment in her brief and silent screen appearance as Skeeter's nanny.\n\nThe treatment of the serious story is light, with just the right amount of humor. It is a Disney production so we do not really expect this to be \"Roots\" or \"A Color Purple.\" The subject matter in itself may not really appeal too much for all audiences especially in this part of the world, but the message of hope and redemption will make this movie universally meaningful."

So emotional, so funny, so sad while never being to much of either. It tells a powerful and painful story that many people should be interested in.

I'm currently reading the book for the first time and it so good.

        "review_detailed_main": "Pros: The entire cast does a fantastic job of filling the roles that they were chosen to fill. Specifically, Viola Davis makes the most of her limited opportunity and turns her character into an appropriate central figure, while Octavia Spencer makes a fine effort of stealing every scene she's in. I would think it would take some courage on the part of Bryce Dallas Howard to play the role she was cast in, as most people, upon viewing, might be tempted to see her as the \"Godless woman\" that she portrays. I always have a little extra respect for those actors all while I'm struggling not to yell at their characters through the screen. The highlight performance to me, however, is Jessica Chastain, who depicts an individual incredibly lovable in her naivet\u00e9. She just doesn't realize that black people are supposed to be viewed as second class citizens by their white - and superior (<-- sarcasm) - counterparts, which makes her the most easily likable character in the movie (to me).\n\nCons: I tend to struggle with works like this. On the one hand, it appears to be doing some good by shedding light on the sh*tty circumstances for black people in the deep south during the time of segregation. On the other hand, however, there is room for the argument that it doesn't go far enough, and that it is arguably still detrimental to equality by continuing some stereotypes. I generally end up siding with the idea that any progress is a positive sign, and the only ultimate \"cure\" for inequality is time, while movies like this (and hopefully real world people like some of the characters in it) can help usher along the process.\n\nBut I do still have a hard time with dialog as clich\u00e9 and hard to swallow as, \"You is good, you is kind, you is special.\" I can't say for certain whether this kind of dialog is appropriate to the time, place, and people. I'm aware that African American Vernacular English does exist, but I'm hardly an expert on it, and as such I cannot figure out where my comfort line should be drawn with its use. Parts of the dialog in this movie seemed to make, for instance, the strong central figure of Aibileen still appear weak. Some aspects of the script were actually pretty good and entertaining, with sharp and funny dialog and a plot worth following after the first half hour or so. But then Davis gets saddled with lines like that... It really is pretty impressive that she was able to shine through some of what the author/scriptwriter decided she ought to say.\n\nSomething that bothered me on a bit more of a superficial level was the fact that Emma Stone's character was supposed to be unattractive. I understand Hollywood likes to cast attractive young actresses as \"the ugly girl,\" but they at least generally try to make her look ugly. This movie didn't even try to do that. Stone just kept walking around, looking her normal cute self, while everyone referred to how visually unappealing she was. Let's have a little more effort there, filmmakers...\n\nOverall: A number of scenes were indeed entertaining to watch, but all too much of it just made me uncomfortable. I don't blame the movie, of course, for portraying people and situations that are all too real and have every reason to make me uncomfortable (oh yea, and pretty angry). I encourage you to sit down and watch it, and if you are able to sit through the whole thing without being bothered by the actions of any of the white people in it, tell me so that I can know I have no interest in talking to you ever again. All told, it's a decent movie with good acting, an engaging plot, and a shaky script, and that ultimately doesn't really have anything other than a decent message to make it special. While wanting to give it a higher rating because I believe in the idea behind the story, I ended up giving it a 7 out of 10 just because the movie itself didn't knock my socks off."

The story takes place in the 60's with the civil rights movement and has to do with the mistreatment of black housemaids during that era and what blacks went through. And revolves around a writer Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan(Emma Stone) writing about what the black housemaids went through and tries to get it published. This movie takes place in a conservative era and portrays most of the whites as arrogant one dimensional superficial characters. I guess it's needed to show the cruelty the blacks faced during that era but sometimes it just seemed a bit forced at times. Maybe I had to have lived during that era to get a better understanding though. The movie is a bit dry though and it sort of reminded me of books I had to read in middle school although it's based on a novel. It was sad to see how the blacks were treated in a degrading and demeaning manner in that era. Nothing new to anyone that graduated from high school but still leaves a bit of an impact. If your looking for a fast paced movie with some shock factor in some genre like this you might be a bit disappointed. But this movie does a decent job of showing the feeling and emotions of blacks during that era. And their perspective of what is going on at that time. This is a good movie to show in school during class in order to educate the students but it's not a movie that I would watch again. But it makes you think when it's over, especially about how the blacks were forced sometimes no matter how hard they worked they didn't have enough to give their children a proper life. I am not going to lie and say it's one of the most exciting movie of the year it just lacked the focus but it's a film that is worth seeing and has good character development and that applies to the side characters as well.\n\n7.2/10"

The Help has a cast that is able to carry the story with moments of humor balancing the hardships of being victims of racism. The Evangelical Baptists and Congregations were filled with much oppression and ignorance during this time. Why is this not touched upon with a more accurate eye. 50 years later, Mississippi is ranked the most miserable state. Perhaps, in the sequel, \"More Help\" we may see such realism.

If you read the earlier reviews you will already know that the help are the black housemaids that handled white folks' housekeeping and child care.\n\nThere are many fine performances all the way around. The actresses who play the help are excellent. Two of them deserve consideration when award season comes around again. The actresses who play the seething, detestable, racist oppressors of the help are portrayed as one-dimensional cartoonish characters. One exception is a ditsy, white- trash-blonde-sexpot with a heart of gold who married up. It turns out that she is also on the receiving end the wrath of the southern belles. To conjure an image of the belles, imagine a race-baiting June Cleaver, pearls and all, with a deep-south accent and nasty disposition added to her sweet side. For the ditsy blond, gather up and image of Ellie May Clampett from the Beverly Hillbillies.\n\nThe only multi-dimensional white woman in the film is the southern girl who is hell-bent on breaking the mold. She returns from college and decides to write an expose of the help; with the help of the help. She enlists the maids to be her confederates in her clandestine operation.\n\nAlthough somewhat predictable, the film is engaging, moving, sad, enraging, funny and well staged and performed by all of the actors. I enjoyed The Help and I think you will too."

This works as a fairytale (sort of), but has some fine acting to back that up. Jessica Chastain is the first name that springs to mind. A superb turn and very inspired. It feels like she is/was a star for a long time, when you see what a line-up she has/had for 2010-2012. And I don't see an end to that career anytime soon. Of course you also have to name the ever-wonderful Sissy Spacek. It's glorious how much fun she has with her role.\n\nOf course all the other actresses (mostly female cast) are good too. The turn of Emma Stones mother (her characters mother that is), is played nicely, but there is a turn of character in the movie that just does not feel right. It does work for the movie, but just by an inch. And of course the overall role of Emma Stone could be questioned, but that would take a direction, that I do not want to take my comment on the movie.\n\nSo if you are up for a light drama, you will enjoy this very much. But bare in mind, it is not really perfect (Bryce Dallas Howards character has quite a few moments, where she doesn't \"act\" as the character should)! Try not to think too much about it"

People may say it is too watered down and doesn't convey the violence of the African American experience. This film does NOT depict the experience of all African Americans. It depicts the experiences of a subset of the race as seen through a white woman's eyes. This is how the author related to the story. As the audience, we see it as she sees it. Other people may say it is just another movie depicting black women in subservient roles. They were! Especially these women! While the story itself is false, it closely mirrors the stories of many southern families. Perhaps what these critics should be concerned with certain other films marketing racist images toward a largely black audience! The performances in this film are incredible. The writing is strong. It is sensitive to issues of gender and race alike. Overall a very moving experience at the movies."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is the 2011 movie I had missed seeing earlier. I have now caught up with it and it is indeed a first rate movie. It is an incisive study of the way black domestic helps were mistreated in the America of the 60s. It is interesting to note that the actors of the 2011 movie have progressed into stars of today. Jessica Chastain is presently on top of the world having won the Oscar award for \" The Eyes of Tammy Faye \" . Viola Davis was a front runner in 2020 for the Oscar award for \" Ma Rainey's bottom\". Emma Stone played the female lead in \" La La Land\" a few years back. All three actors have done a splendid job in this movie. Of course not forgetting Octavia Spencer who is also a very talented artist and was excellent in a later movie called \" Hidden figures\".\n\nThis movie is set in the time of the civil rights movement in the 60s. (There is a brief mention of the JFK assassination.) Emma Stone is a budding journalist who interviews and writes an account of the revelations of some black domestic helps and publishes a book by that name. The movie shows that while some white mistresses treated their helps affectionately, a few treated them with contempt and hatred. The law also treated blacks in a rough manner. The issue of non availability of bathrooms for blacks dealt with sensitively was also brought up later in \" Hidden figures\" . Director Tate Taylor needs to applauded for treating the subject with great sensitivity. Actingwise, all actors have done a commendable job, and rightly deserve all the wins/ nominations of the awards."

        "review_detailed_main": "Although Kathryn Stockett struggled with over 60 agents and had her novel rejected repeatedly the 2011 summer release THE HELP is been widely accepted even as you read this. Summer 2011 is not one of the best we have experienced in the lines of cinema. With just a handful of movies that would remain in our minds I consider THE HELP an exhilarating and heartwarming production that contains emotions and laughter from a time not too long ago. I have not clearly lived during the timelines the plot has been set. In fact the Civil rights movements and the efforts to create equality between color, race and religion is something I have just read during history lessons. To see it been brought to life at a time where racism and religious discrimination is frowned upon and where equality is boasted of is quite interesting. Especially to read the uprising debates the movie seems to have caused within some communities. If THE HELP is fact or fiction is irrelevant at this point. However the beauty and the depth the movie is revealed to me should not go unnoticed. There is an aura of near perfection that seems to hover around this title. The screenplay that has been adapted by the novel itself is said to be doing extreme justice to the original text the experts say. I have not read the novel. In fact I have not read the Harry Potter novels. However this does not stop me nor did it stop those who passed judgment on the HP franchise. The magical screenplay and direction that is done by Tate Taylor who is said to be a childhood friend of the author is key ingredient. Taylor's vision and heart is in the right place when he tries to extract the emotional lives of the black women of Jackson Mississippi. I have read many write ups about the racial atrocities that has taken place around the world. In fact I have seen with my own eyes the ethnic conflicts that stir up from some of them. THE HELP is just one of those stories that made it to the light! Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer clearly stood out with one of the best performances I have seen in recent times. They drew tears to my eyes. To be the help at the said time and to be in their situation is something that I am unable to even imagine myself in. Yet Spencer and Davis took me to 1960s Jackson. They showed me the pain and discrimination. They showed how much they gave up just making sure their children could have a better life (Although the outcome was not what they expected). The most important lesson I learnt by being in the year 2011 from the movie is that even with all the imaginable hardships of the world are upon them, they will not give up! Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer you ladies nailed it! There convincing performance was not too far away from Bryce Dallas Howard who places the other extreme end of the racial white house lady. Her ultimate goal of creating equality from within separation, Brilliant performance! Tate Taylor wanted her to come out as being mean insensitive and callous and Bryce Howard did Taylors expectations Justice. Between the help and the lords of the house there is a common ground. This is where Emma Stone comes in. I need to be honest; I was not a believer that Stone could pull through the perfect Skeeter. To my amazement she did. This Performance of Stone holds the Davis-Spencer Vs Howard battle in a balance. Aibileen Clark who has raised 17 white children is a black woman from Jackson Mississippi. She loves the children she raises just as if they were her own. In fact the children love the help more than they love their own mothers. This is only fair since the mothers of the time showed seem to have got their priorities pretty mixed up! Minny Jackson who works for the Holbrook house walks out one day after failing to tolerate the cruelty of the lady of the house. Jackson Journal writer Skeeter returns home after her graduation to find out that her maid Constantine who has raised all her life has been sent away by her mother. Skeeter who does not respond to this very well takes up to write the stories of black women and their emotional struggle for survival. However she is unable to find a volunteer who would share with her. THE HELP is a must watch drama and is indeed one of a kind. Guaranteed to have you balling out by the end of the movie and will make you look harder into yourself. A movie from the point of view of the help a movie that deserves a nod at the Oscars! Title: THE HELP Directed by: Tate Taylor Starring: Emma Stone, Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer and Bryce Dallas Howard Rated: PG13 for thematic material Rating: 09/10 146 Minutes"

        "review_detailed_main": "I felt like this was trying to be an epic drama but at times descended into triviality.\n\nThough the topic of race relations was obviously prevalent in the film, it wasn't put up to much scrutiny or analysis. I've heard some people drawing similarities to The Blind Side in regards to this topic, which is in some ways true because it refuses to delve into the issue more and the characters are very flat and not prone to change of any kind. The dialogue was also very sparse at times and had a hard time keeping me interested.\n\nThat being said, I enjoyed how they did take on another topic more thoroughly, and that's how the lives of suburban mothers rotates solely around gossip and every person seems to be constantly on their guard, waiting to point out something that they find irritating amongst their fellow neighbors. I don't think I've seen a film cover that topic successfully since 2006's Little Children.\n\nThere were also some good performances in the film, including those of Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, and--even though her character was very one-dimensional--Bryce Dallas Howard. Thomas Newman's score was also brilliant--prevalent when it needed to be and subtle the rest of the time.\n\nIs it perfect? No. Will it please the wider audiences? Most likely."

        "review_detailed_main": "'THE HELP': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)\n\nAnother 2011 Academy Award 'Best Picture' nominee, this one being financially the most successful of the bunch. It's an unbalanced film combining serious emotional drama dealing with real racial issues with exaggerated sentimentality and cheesy comic relief. It was written and directed by actor turned filmmaker Tate Taylor, which he adapted from a book (of the same name) by Kathryn Stockett. It's an ensemble piece in which three actresses were also nominated for Academy Awards (Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain).\n\nEmma Stone stars as Skeeter Phelan, an author in 1960's Mississippi who recently graduated college and moved back home with her family. She discovers that the maid who raised her (Cicely Tyson) has quit but is suspicious about what really happened to her and can't get much information out of her parents (Allison Janney and Brian Kerwin). After witnessing more abuse of other maids she's come to know in the area she decides to write a book from the African American maids point of view about working for white families. At first many are afraid to help her, out of fear what could result from it, but she slowly earns the help of one bold maid name Aibillen Clark (Davis).\n\nThe movie is hard hitting at times but other times the drama feels far too forced. Still it's much better than the likes of something like 'THE BLIND SIDE'. It's also filled with odd comedy including those involving fecal matter. None of that quite comes off right but when the film works it really works and is very memorable at times. Davis is outstanding in the lead and Chastain and Bryce Dallas Howard (the two would be sisters) are both exceptional in supporting roles as well. I found Spencer's character to be too much of an exaggerated stereotype forced to deliver the bulk of the bad comedy, which Spencer does a good job at but not an Oscar worthy performance (due to the directing and writing of her role). The movie as a whole is a mixed bag but definitely worth a look.\n\nWatch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd0S1srQ9T8"

These performers all had easy parts since their drums were easy to bang. BUT Bryce Dallas Howard was remarkable. From the beginning to end, her character was an unlikable southern racist. This must have been a very difficult part for this young woman to play. If one plays an evil murderer or a vampire, they get a pass\u0085if one plays a racist \u2013 a very brave move and she did an outstanding job. I do remember these times but not from a southerners' perspective, but from one in the north looking south. As a Yankee, many of us are way too busy painting a racist brush over the southern whites - never taking the time to gaze into our own mirrors. Ah well, that is enough pontificating. The ingredients of this film are so well blended and the story is so masterfully told, that it should result in jarring race relations bring set back twenty years. Like, 'The Holocaust' or 'Bataan Death March', this was a terrible time and should never be forgotten."

        "review_detailed_main": "\u00a8If you can love your enemy, you already have victory.\u00a8 The Help has received a lot of Oscar buzz and I wouldn't be surprised if it gets many nominations, but I was a little disappointed after watching the film since I had such high expectations for it. The Help is a good, solid movie, but it just didn't live up to all the hype for me. Racial and segregation films like this one have been made before with much greater effects. This film felt a bit light at times, and reminded me a lot of Fried Green Tomatoes. I can't help but think this film could've been much stronger considering the strong cast it had and the social issues it was pointing out. The film is based on Kathryn Stockett's novel of the same name, and it was adapted for the screenplay by director Tate Taylor himself. This is Taylor's second film, after having made a small film three years ago named Pretty Ugly People. Taylor, a relatively unknown has jumped to fame with his work in this movie, but considering the material I think a good director could've brought so much more to the story. In a way this seems to be a light drama which is touching a serious and dark period for many people. There are some funny moments, but the movie is really long and drags during some periods of time. I thought that the last half hour was probably the best part of the movie and you end up leaving the theater with a smile in your face. It's a good movie with some terrific performances, but I just was expecting so much more.\n\nThe Help is a reference to the maids in Jackson, Mississippi during the 60's when racial discrimination and segregation was really strong. Civil rights movements had begun, but separation between whites and blacks was still very much an issue. The movie centers around several Southern society girls and the relationship they have with their maids. Skeeter (Emma Stone) returns home after college to take care of her sick mother (Allison Janney) and gets a job at a local newspaper writing housekeeping articles. Since she has no clue whatsoever about housekeeping she decides to interview the maids. Skeeter is sad to hear that the maid she grew up with and was like a mother to her has left to Chicago, but realizes there might be more to it than her mother is telling her. Skeeter is the only single girl since all her friends are already married and have children. Her best friend Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) is president of a local society and has come up with the idea that every family should have a special and separate bathroom for their maids. This of course, because of fear that they will transmit some sort of disease to their children. Hilly is very cruel towards her maid Minny (Octavia Spencer) and one day in a dispute fires her. Minny then finds a job working for a very nice lady named Celia Foote (Jessica Chastain) who's just arrived back in Jackson with her husband and live in a huge house. She is very disorganized, but Minny helps her get the house organized. Meanwhile, Skeeter realizes how terrible most maids are treated and decides she wants to write a book about the help, but written with the maids point of view. Skeeter begins interviewing her maid's best friend, Aibeleen (Viola Davis), who has had a lot of experience working with high society white families. Hesitant at first Aibeleen then begins opening up and convincing other maids to tell their stories to Skeeter and the result might shake things up for the residents in Jackson, Mississippi.\n\nThe best thing about The Help without a doubt is the performance from the entire cast. Emma Stone does a great job as the lead character fighting for the rights of some of the maids which have been such a great help to her, but at the same time realizes that her friends will probably be upset with what she's doing. She still speaks what's on her mind and isn't afraid to point out the things that are wrong. She is very courageous. Viola Davis is just excellent and will probably receive an Oscar nomination. She also has a lead role in my opinion and she is just good in every movie she's in. She does a great job at repressing the anger she sometimes feels after suffering so much injustice. Her friend Minny, played by Octavia Spencer, doesn't do such a great job at repressing that anger and sometimes explodes. Spencer really surprised me in this film; she does a great job and absolutely nails her role. She will get a lot more job offers after this. It's hard to pick just one performance because everyone in this film does such an outstanding job. Jessica Chastain is excellent in this movie in her supporting role and perhaps gives the best performance of all. She is sweet and naive, but also feels broken due to her incapacity of bearing children. It's really sad considering she probably would be a lovable mother, unlike the rest of the society moms who can't even pick up their own kids and leave it all to the maids. I can't end this review without mentioning Bryce Dallas Howard who is just so good at being bad, mean, and cruel. She truly is scary in this movie and plays an excellent villain. The Help is a good movie, I just was expecting a little more from the story, but still go see it.\n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "The film won a deserving best supporting actress Oscar and lost out a best actress Oscar to a performance in a film that as of this writing has an IMDb score of 6.4, that more than anything sums up The Help. The important story is overshadowed by a more marketable one, which to Disney's credit is what they do best, they are marketing juggernauts. As for The Help it never feels genuine, in the same way that most people of a certain age remember white Christmases, when in reality the historical data shows there were actually very few. That is The Help, a white Christmas from our past that is marketing induced rather than a truly honest memory of the way things were."

        "review_detailed_main": "Have not read the novel, but whoever directed this film probably intended to make one that was toned down without any complications that would have made this movie too controversial and heavy to watch.\n\nThough shallow, simplistic and many times splashing out 'fairy-tale pixie dust' all over, the film still contained enough power to be as heartwarming as it can be. What I also like about it is it not only dealt with the theme of racial tension, it also humorously covered those within people of the same race but with contrasting personalities. I am also impressed that changes meant some things were not meant to end well.\n\nHowever, sadly the potential was not utilized to the utmost and this became disappointing for a film of such calibre and material that I expect it to be. I thought it could have been a lot more, as well as a lot less of the conflict between characters that I don't quite get how they fit into the bigger picture. Some of the characters were too forward-thinking, did not act like a woman of that time, or oblivious to what is happening around. Still, much better than some of the under-serving Oscar nominees to date."

        "review_detailed_main": "If this film were total fiction bearing no relation to reality, it would still be worth seeing for the fine acting and production values--even if some of the young white women approached \"Southern Gothic.\"\n\nBut it wasn't fiction--at least, the depiction of Southern society wasn't. As I watched I kept drifting back to small-town South Carolina in the 1950s, where I grew up. It was moving and disturbing to be reminded how black people were treated then--loved and yet \"kept down in their place.\" Our neighborhood was all middle-class and every family had a maid. There were plenty of boys my age, we visited in each other's homes, and called every maid by her first name. One even started a baseball team for the little white boys, for which her reward was a visit by the Klan.\n\nOur maid helped my mother cook and clean. One of my parents picked her up and took her home every day--and she rode in the back seat. She ate her lunch in our kitchen--without being allowed to use our utensils. I remember her eating with her fingers. I do not remember ever seeing her use our bathrooms. I thought about that during the movie and truly cannot recall what she did, an embarrassing gap in memory.\n\nI do remember when my father was out of work and our maid had to be cut back to three days a week. I actually cried; she was a member of our family. When talk about civil rights began in the late 1950s, my mother became annoyed at our maid for getting \"uppity.\" And so it went. We moved to central Florida in 1961, where there were no maids.\n\nTravel back in time with this film. It's quite real, and I highly recommend it."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Help is a story about a young woman who goes to Jackson, Mississippi. She goes in search of a job, especially journalism. When she arrives she meets her childhood friend, who is a complete utter racist. But she then shows sympathy to the black maids known as the help and has an idea to write a novella about the p.o.v of the help. But her meticulous friend has other plans.\n\nNow, this movie is show stopping, the acting by Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer is FLAWLESS. With Oscar buzzing all over the place for this movie, I wanted to know why? So I went to see this movie with high expectations from all of it's five Oscar nominations and I found it to be a wonderful, beautiful account about racism and chance and most of all revenge for nothing. I hope this movie will come along the lines of such classics like Forrest Gump.\n\nThis movie is a \"thematic\" movie. Although this movie is not perfect, it is still a great movie 4 1/2 movie reels from me. I hope you like my review. Thatmoviecritic101."

        "review_detailed_main": "Little known director Tate Taylor was certainly lucky to have such a pal as Kathryn Stockett. As the new girl in town heralding from Jackson, Mississippi, Stockett had a lot of trouble getting her first book published, The Help, based largely on the controversial topic that she was a white writer telling a story from a black woman's perspective. How shocking, how risqu\u00e9\u0085wait it is 2011, right? Are there such things as artistic boundaries anymore? Maybe for Taylor, whose film version of his friend's runaway hit novel, is stealing the hearts of America right before our eyes. And maybe he played it a bit safe, but it's a rare safeness that is hardly ever done well. Lucky, again, for Mr. Taylor, his result is amazing.\n\nThe Help is about a woman trying to rev up a career as a writer, but lacks the connections, and frankly, the story to go on. Seeing the horrid mistreatment and racism going on in Jackson, Skeeter (Emma Stone) decides to write something that might help change all that. Her gentle motivation turns into passion and she begins to interview maids of her white- society-snob friends, and really gets onto something. Such a formulaic plot that we've seen before, but The Help does it with such humor and heart that it's spectacular. The filmmaking isn't innovative in any unique way, there is nothing really gritty or challenging about the racist terror that was in fact happening at the time, but I doubt the film would have benefited about that. It is not the story of a civil rights epic, but instead takes us to a more quiet advocacy, one that seems possible, and true, and yet altogether the most inspired.\n\nWhoever cast this film should get a raise. Emma Stone turns in a great performance, as usual, though her every-day-girl vibe doesn't allow her to stand out in this film, full of such distinct and memorable characters. Bryce Dallas Howard, as the main white antagonist Hilly Holbrook, is viciously evil and eats up every bit of this film with a force that makes us feel Howard knows the type of bigotry and hates that it still goes on; her character is written very one- sided, but she understands the inauthenticity and thoughtlessness of those women's racism, and plays it without fear. Jessica Chastain, hot off her dazzling understated performance in The Tree of Life, is so damn charming as the naive Celia, who knows about as much about how to treat African Americans in the south as she does to cook a pie, which is to say, not much. She is kind, funny, genuine, and it's hard not to love her. The real scene-stealers here are the undeniably spectacular performances from the two central maid characters: Viola Davis as Aibileen and Octavia Spencer as Minny. Both have strong dramatic moments, especially Davis, and Spencer has you laughing so damn hard you almost forget all the horrible things her character has to go through. It shows strength in the actress, and it shows strength in the character. Davis is a marvel; passive when she needs to be and then in full bloom as this beautiful and inspiring character when Aibileen can truly be herself around Minny or Skeeter.\n\nThrough such a formulaic story and filmmaking techniques, it could have been a much different, mediocre film. But the incredible cast along with Taylor (with Stockett's help no doubt) make it feel authentic and as warm as a cherry pie from Jackson, Mississippi. And, damn, it tastes so good. A-"

Performances were great and I still enjoyed it, but I was hoping for something epic."

This movie was directed and produced by Tate Taylor. It was on screen in 2011. The stars who played in are : Emma Stone (skeeter), Viola Davis(Aibileen), Octavia Spenser(Minny) and others.\n\n-To resume- Skeeter a white journalist , finds a job in Mississipi, she had to write a journal article to interest her boss. She wants to write a book about the black maid's work conditions to denounce them. She speaks with a black maid, named Aibileen, but Aibileen disagrees. Finally she accepts to speak about her job conditions but she is nervous. In her book Skeeter speaks about Aibileen but also about Elisabeth Leefot, Aibileen's boss, and about Minny, the friend of Aibileen.She speaks about Miss Hilly Holbrook, a 24 years old woman who is the president oh the Junior League and active in all charity. She is Minny's employer, but she is a very racist girl.\n\n-In conclusion- It's a good film which deals whit the black segregation. To my mind it's a too long film and I dislike it because it's not my favorite movie genre. I think it's however a movie to see because it's welldone , it's down to earth and realistic."
