But how can I not be with a cast that includes Claire Forlani, Ron Perlman and the great Christopher Lee? It is quite impossible.\n\nIf you don't count them in, this is more miss than hit. Still there are some fun little nuggets to be found here. But it is really a good thing they stopped making those. Because I wouldn't have been able to say after this: I'm through. Although there still is the TV show to watch I reckon ... well maybe I'll endure that too one day ... never say never.\n\nElvis references aside (someone over there in Russia apparently was a big fan), revolutions not being taken in, this tries to bond the US with the Russians I reckon ... I don't think it really succeeds, but what do I know."

It's as silly as ever, but quite inoffensive, and Ian Jones captures some wonderful Moscow locations. Just think, without the fall of the Berlin wall, this film would not have been possible! Rife with continuity errors (look at the car windows during the chase sequence, and note that Perlman's character's last name is spelled differently on a manifest than it appears elsewhere), this was obviously filmed on the cheap. I like it anyway."

This movie is one level above terrible just because it's a PA movie and has most of your favorite characters in it like Captain Harris, \"Motor Mouth\" Jones, Callahan, Tackleberry, and Commandat Lassard. The plot is really bad. There are some genuinely funny moments in the movie. But there are only a few. It seems low budget, poorly written, and basically everything else that can be wrong, is wrong. But I suggest you watch it so you will have the ability to say you've seen all SEVEN police academy movies, and can trick your friends into watching this debacle, just like what I'm trying to do to you right now."

        "review_detailed_main": "What is it that's so resolutely unfunny about Mission to Moscow? Is it the lifeless direction? The disinterested performances? The lack of atmosphere? The joke-free script? It's all of these things, of course, but there's also something inexplicably poor about it that you just can't quite put your finger on.\n\nThe regulars are the major weak point. While the guest cast have the misjudged enthusiasm to irksomely overact, all the usual culprits seem embarrassed by the whole thing. None of them sell their underwritten, reheated lines, and the fact that Bubba Smith and Marion Ramsey failed to sign up is a damning indictment. What comes through the screen, from George Gaynes to David Graf, is the sense of souls bleeding. \"Please get me a proper job, there must be a better way to pay my mortgage\" these actors scream with every fibre of their being. Leslie Easterbrook gets her usual single \"my character's got big breasts\" joke - why does she even bother to sign up for this crap? Michael Winslow looks old, tired, and frankly bored with the whole thing. Was his involvement only confirmed at the last minute? Because while he gives a curiously muted performance throughout, the script also fails to accommodate his talents in almost any way. Note that this is the ONLY Police Academy sequel in which he doesn't do his (admittedly run into the ground) \"Bruce Lee\" schtick.\n\nPolice Academy managed to keep up the same level of quality between films three to six - they were all rubbish. But even by their low standards Mission to Moscow plumbs the depths, making Citizens on Patrol look like Annie Hall. New recruit Charlie Schlatter, there for the completely incongruous love interest theme, is never funny and the Russian characters are the crass stereotypes you'd expect. Any film that promises \"we're going to kick buttski\" is clearly dumber than is tolerable, and a tasteless reference to Chernobyl doesn't help matters.\n\nThe only Police Academy film made outside the 80s, it was produced five years after the last one - why?!!?? Was there a big demand in the market for sh*te? Some cartoon sound effects (whistles, birdcall, etc.) are added to the action to try and pep things up, but this really is a DOA of a movie. True to form (or should that be formula?) it ends with an extended chase sequence that is neither suspenseful nor convincing.\n\nJust look at scenes like the one where G.W. Bailey gets hit in the face with stew. The stew is clearly missing his face and just lands on his chin, so Bailey (the only regular who tries) moves his face so that the full brunt of the stew will land on it. This dedication to duty is admirable, but also perfectly highlights the sloppy desperation of the whole thing.\n\nThe series' move from the teen fodder of the first two, 15 certificate, movies had been subverted into the last five, PG cert entries. This is at its lowest ebb here; a comedy that seems wholly aimed at the under-5s and doesn't know what to do with its characters. Russian acrobats entertain the kiddies while its ... er... \"stars\"... are left to stand around like second bananas, giving unfunny reaction shots.\n\nMaybe it's the \"fish out of water\" feel of it all, with the somewhat flat Russian espionage themes failing to ignite. But whatever it is, Mission to Moscow feels like a TV sitcom with the canned laughter track removed. In any other franchise this would be described as an \"unfortunate, sad end\" to the series. With Police Academy however, finishing with one of the unfunniest comedies of all time seems strangely apt. 2/10."

I don't give many movie Zero stars, because I like giving at least a full star rating, but this sequel is just so awful one cannot even believe their eyes when watching this worthless tripe. Is there one laugh to be found in the entire movie? Well, yes there was one scene that had me laughing, it's how the news reporter is supposed to be hooked on \"The Game\" but there is actually no video game inside the unit. Aside from that this is so awful that it doesn't even deserved to be mentioned in the same sentence as comedy, indeed it doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence of Police Academy 5! The only positive spin I can perhaps put on Mission To Moscow is that it most likely killed the series, and even if it didn't, there's no possible way a sequel could be worse than this.\n\n0/5 Matt Bronson"

We see something with a bellboy in a hotel, then something with Lassard getting in the wrong car, some bike tricks with Jones, just try to make a plot out of this. The actors all look incredibly bored, even the new guy seems like he's already sick of these movies. The attempts to humour are just really bizarre. Of course you have the usual reused jokes from the original, but now they've added weird cartoon sound effects to them like you're on a really bad trip. In reality you're just watching a really bad movie. Really it's no surprise this movie tanked, just check out the tagline. Oh God the tagline. Kicking buttski(cringe).

In Police Academy : Mission to Moscow , the bumbling team to accomplish the most dangerous assignments , this time to confront nasty Russian mobsters . It is a run-of-the-mill follow-up with ordinary trappings , antics , confusion and mayhem . The misfit Police Academy is now assigned an abroad mission in this sequel to the popular Police Academy movie, as they go to cold Moscow, a few years after their success in Police Academy 6: City under siege (1989). Here Commandant Rakov (Christopher Lee) calls in friend Commandant Eric Lassard (George Gaynes) to lend a hand in stopping a megalomaniac Russian mobster , and before long, the experienced team to carry out their mission . The Russians need help in dealing with the Mafia and so they seek help with the veterans of the academy . They head off to Moscow, in order to find evidence against Konstantine Konali (Ron Perlman) , who marketed a computer game that everyone in the world is playing . As our friends Larvell Jones (Michael Winslow), Eugene Tackleberry (David Graf) , Captain Callahan : Leslie Easterbrook proceed to a risked journey to contend the most dangerous criminals in the world . Kicking buttski !. Making you laughski !. The Academy is backski! Just when we thought the Cold War was over, leave it to these guys to heat it up again !. The Police Academy regulars, from meathead Tackleberry to the impeccably inept Cmdt. Lassard, are back again to answer law enforcement's most uproarious role call !. Take off with the original cast... and some new recruits as they take to the streets and the skies to fight crime . On land, on sea, or in the air, no place is safe from them! But relax, Russia . Think of the academy. Now that's the kind of school people can trust, the kind of school whose grads fight crime with slapstick instead of nightsticks. Those goofy oddballs in blue are going to tangle ! . Objective: Laughs. Hold everything! The cadets are training for an all new adventure!\n\nInferior entry but amusing , funny and cheerful film , filled with action-packed , thrills , hilarious set-pieces, tongue-in-cheek and lots of humor. As the more bumbling team formed by the police officer friends Michael Winslow : Jones , David Graf : Tackleberry and a nerdish recently graduated Cadet Connors : Charlie Schlatter and Commandant Lassard : George Gaynes are assigned an overseas trek to fight crime once again plaguing the Moscow streets. The premise is simple and plain , as our misfit , botcher team from the known police force is assigned a Russian mission and subsequently to undertake a confrontation to an evil gang . Director delivers a professional work but with no much interest , his knack of getting the most out of characters and situations without ever going over the top making for some very big laughs . This production pays tribute to previous film , taking parts here and there , and repeating former sketches . The jokes and frolics come as thick and fast , hit and miss as usual and it is done in good spirit if not always in good taste . So-so picture with accent on sight gags , and humour that stems from the diverting roles established in other movies . The sympathetic cast formed by the motley band of misfits giving fun interpretation creating confusion , laughs ,mayhem and chaos . Showing up habitual actors in the popular series, such as Michael Winslow , David Graf , and of course G. W. Bailey who in previous entries had hoped to return as Lieutenant Harris, but was passed over in favor of Art Metrano , but he appeared in this Police Academy 4 and other sequels . In fact , Michael Winslow, David Graf, and George Gaynes are the only actors to appear in all seven Police Academy movies. However, original cast members had allegedly complained about losing screentime to the new cast members. It contains an attractive and lively score by Robert Folk , series' regular , including the classic leitmotif . As well as atmospheric and appropriate cinematography . The motion picture was regular but professionally directed by Alan Metter and with no originality, because it copies other previous films of the famous saga . As trivia to mention the risked conditions to shoot when government troops began their assault on the Russian parliament building , in fact President Boris Yeltsin was literally at war with the Communist-controlled Duma as the entire cast and crew had to retreat quickly on October 4, 1993 . Producer/writer Paul Maslansky and Director Alan Metter were lunching at the United States Embassy when the confrontation began. They decided to re-group with their company at the Hotel Gorbachev Finance Academy, about five miles from the chaos. Filming resumed a few days later, confident that President Boris Yeltsin had regained control.\n\nThe series based on the chracters written by Neal Israel and Pat Proft is as follows : \u00a8Police Academy\u00a8 1984 by Hugh Wilson . \u00a8Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment\u00a8 1985 by Jerry Paris , James Signorelli . \u00a8Police Academy 3: Back in Training\u00a8 1987 by Jerry Paris . \u00a8Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol\u00a8 1987 by Jim Drake . \u00a8Police Academy : Assignment Miami Beach\u00a8 1988 by Alan Myerson.\u00a8Police Academy 6: City Under Siege\u00a8 1989 by Peter Bornerz . \u00a8Police Academy: Mission to Moscow\u00a8 1994 by Alan Metter .

The plot is so deeply stupid that I lose IQ points just typing it. Series regulars George Gaynes, Michael Winslow, David Graf, Leslie Easterbrook, and G.W. Bailey return. No laughs are to be had. The cast, whose likability kept the series afloat early on even when the jokes missed the mark, can do nothing to save this sinking ship. Actually, it had already sunk by this point. Now it's just a few survivors desperately trying to stay afloat before the sharks eat them. Avoid unless you are a glutton for punishment."

        "review_detailed_main": "The first \"Police Academy\" was a mildly funny film with a lot of jokes...some very funny, many not. It's surprising because of this that six other film sequels followed as well as a short-lived TV series. While I have only seen the first two films, I decided to watch this final movie for one big reason...it's currently on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List--the 100 lowest rated major release films. Somehow it turned out to be the only entry in the series to make the list.\n\nThe plot involves SOME of the idiots from the previous films being invited to Russia to help the Russian police capture a gangster named Kanali (Ron Perlman). And, once there, the team act like a bunch of brain-dead buffoons. Steve Guttenberg left the series after the fourth film (a sure sign that the franchise stinks when even Guttenberg won't appear in the movies), he's replaced with a bland wimp played by...well, who cares?? He's not the only absence...several other series regulars are strangely absent....their good luck, actually as the film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever....none.\n\nHow bad all this? Well, for starters nothing about this is funny. Instead of laughs, they use a lot of bad slapstick...such as a scene where the perennial foil, Captain Harris, has a dog urinate in his face and several scenes where guys are hit in the crotch. Also, for big laughs(?) all the sound effects not done by Michael Winslow were stangely loud and exaggerated. None of the film makes much sense and it's obvious that the actors were simply going through the motions in order to get a paycheck and they had pretty much given up on their careers.\n\n\n\nOverall, a film that is LESS funny than cancer...and a truly cynical excuse to squeeze the last few dollars out of a failing franchise. See it only if, like me, you actually WANT to see all of the Bottom 100. I can think of no other reason to see it...unless you are a masochist or plan on using it to torture someone.\n\nI give this one a 2....as at least the film has nice cinematography and is in focus and has sound."

Clearly the writers didn't care, so why should we? Trust me, when you find out what the supposed plan is, it's beyond ridiculous. I watched the second movie, the third and then this on TV. Not sure why they skipped the three inbetween... I have a hard time imagining that they were worse than this. At this time six years had passed since a flick in the series(you know, back when they cranked them out as if their oxygen supply was depending on it). You might think this time was spent on a script. You would be wrong. This is violently unfunny, with extremely poor, uninspired and half-assedly executed gags. Do you laugh when you see things flying back and forth through the air? If so, this is for you. Literally, I think that was their goal. Try to count the amount of objects that you'll see this happen to. They're also unbelievably culturally insensitive. If this stuff was at least clever, or had genuine observations, but it's based on a proud ignorance(and clear fear) of anything beyond the borders of the US. Had this been seen by many ex-Soviets, the Cold War may have started back up. Not just because it's offensive, no, also on account of how incredibly stupid it makes its country of origin look. Look. I have guilty pleasures. We all do. This one, however, crosses a line that I'm not sure anybody realized existed. You see, whenever the production of a creative enterprise is undertaken, there's an expectation that actual effort will go into it. If nothing else, by accident. This manages to avoid that entirely. A lot of energy must have been spent on keeping it out. The acting is bad. Characters are cartoons. The \"humor\" is screwball without skill. Cinematography and editing are average at best. At least there are hot chicks. There is brief nudity in this. I recommend this to those who have to experience the dread for themselves. 1/10"

It does work for a while until it becomes routine comedy. Slapstick is one but routine gets tiresome. Now I hope this is the final part in the series, 'cuz it gets old too fast.\n\nThe acting was okay, the direction was fairly decent, and that parts finding the person's DNA and habits with the hair and front desk clerk posing as the commander while sitting on the toilet were well done. The main plot was the sleeper here, and the small comedy parts were the interesting parts in this movie hence the 5 out of 10 rating I give."

        "review_detailed_main": "As has been said before in my reviews for the previous six 'Police Academy' films, the best of the 'Police Academy' films will always be the original by quite some way. It isn't great and will never be a favourite comedy or overall film of mine, but it clearly knew what it wanted to be so it was easy to take it for what it was and what it set out to do.\n\nIt was followed by six sequels, and none of them were as good or even on the same level as the first, though admittedly some are worse than others. Most of them are actually being pretty bad or worse and lose what was enjoyable about the original in the first place. While it was with the fourth film where things properly got particularly stale, it was from the fifth film where finding redeeming qualities proved to be difficult, with the sixth film and especially this one being particularly bad.\n\nJust in case you're wondering why all the seven films were watched, mainly it was curiosity to see as to whether the sequels were as bad as their reputations, to see if they were that bad or if it was a case of going against the general consensus (which honestly has happened with me before).\n\n'Police Academy: Mission to Moscow' is the worst of the series and is the first time in a while where watching a film (which always helps me forget any troubles and is a favourite pastime) feels like the viewer is serving a life sentence of their own. Not even some nice locations can save it because a gorgeous city is not used in its full majesty. The previous sequels ranged from tolerable to terrible but still had a couple of casting bright spots or gags that just about worked. 'Police Academy: Mission to Moscow' has neither of those, it's completely devoid of laughs and has no redeeming qualities, as the locations are pretty wasted here they are not enough to count as one.\n\nOnly a few of the original cast members return, but are reduced to acting even stupider than before and looking bored while all their material is one-joke and no longer funny, instead being dull and annoying and saying it's gone beyond breaking point doesn't feel enough. Charlie Schlatter, if can be humanly possible, manages to be even blander and more ill at ease than Matt McCoy.\n\nAnd what possessed great actors like Christopher Lee and Ron Perlman to take part? Lee tries but has very little to do, an unforgivable waste of a screen icon who could turn lesser material into gold when able and a crime that none of the other films committed. Perlman constantly looked like he regretted doing the whole thing, the embarrassment and lack of enthusiasm is all over his face the whole time he's on screen.\n\n'Police Academy: Mission to Moscow' is so amateurish-looking it makes the previous sequels, all of which looked cheap, look like Best Cinematography/Editing Oscar winners. There is nothing memorable about the soundtrack, while the direction gave the sense that the director didn't know what he was doing.\n\nLike the sixth film, the premise was stale by the fourth film but now it is a case of an increasingly thin and repetitive premise stretched to breaking point and now with this film beyond that. The film is completely laughter-free, with recycled material that passed its sell by date long ago, and at worst the writing and gags are worse than infantile, swaps genuine hilarity, wit and cleverness for a distasteful mean-spiritedness, low-brow smut (that would make the crudest 'Carry On' films seen sophisticated in comparison) and juvenile vulgarity.\n\nIn summary, absolutely awful and the worst of the 'Police Academy' films. Mercifully, no more was made after this. 1/10 Bethany Cox"

The film relies on jokes about the Russians and their accents. Even Hooks, Hightower and Hurst fail to reappear. Gaynes is given top-billing, but is reduced to a \"lost in Russia\" subplot. Bailey has nobody to play off making his character the downer for the first time. He needs a Proctor to riff with. Lee and Perlman do their best with bad accents, but just aren't interesting. Winslow, Graf and Easterbrook are used too much, making their characters do things we're not familiar with. Schlatter is a kind of Mahoney, but he's never truly likable. Bad jokes, wasted characters, and a sense that nobody cares about what is going on, leaves this film as useless as you'd expect."

I loved the first one ('Mahomo' still kills me), thought the second was O.K and so on. They gradually got worse and worse (actually six had its moments, but I digress), culminating in this craptacular effort. Actually it culminates in the equally terrible 'Police Academy: The series', but that's neither here nor there (but fits in well on the crap-o-graph).\n\nThis film is bad for so many reasons it is frightening. My first beef is with roping in a few well respected actors into this farrago. My second is with all the terrible Russian stereotypes. Well actually my second is really that this film is crap, but that's a bit general.\n\nThe fact that the Police Academy series has followed such an easily identifiable loss of quality surely showed someone that making this piece of crap was a bad idea. Or at the very least showed them where they went wrong in the previous 4. It is just a project that was bereft of ideas from the start, a sign of a bankrupt imagination.\n\nWhat a load of Crap.

        "review_detailed_main": "The thing with film sequels is that although it is important to retain the premise, the concept and the characters, it is also important that each film is as different and diverse from the last in terms of plot especially. Unfortunately with the Police Academy series, it is the same old lame, toilet filled, childish jokes used over and over again and the same old tireless formula being milked to death. The acting is bad,and when I mean bad, I don't mean wicked or brilliant- just mediocre, the humour is more on par with the under 10s and not even clever and humorous as it was the first time round. The first two films were okay but by the third onwards, it starts to grate on you, as you wonder how on earth the people behind this managed to get away with churning out the same old tireless jokes and infantile, silly humour in each instalment.\n\nThis type of humour worked with the Naked Gun trilogy but that's because it only went as far as three films, which is reasonable enough. But SEVEN? Now that is when a film becomes predictable, the same as the last and thus, it is no longer watchable anymore. Police Academy seven was in itself awful... just bloody awful."

        "review_title": "They exhumed Ed Wood...",
        "review_detailed_main": "Maybe it's the clumsy political message about the good we can all do if we just work together. Maybe it's the poor attempts to make something patently awful seem funny. Perhaps it is the incredibly stilted dialogue. Could it possibly be that the characters don't even receive half of their first dimension? Regardless of the reason, one cannot help but imagine that if Ed Wood were alive today, this would be the kind of film he'd make.\n\nThe Police Academy films as a series were never about high-brow humour, or high-brow anything, but this film has so many problems with it that it's impossible to know where to begin. Charlie Schlatter, obviously desperate to appear in anything since his career tanked after The Delinquents, plays a part that is as discernably different from Brownie Hansen as a white wall is discernably different from a bone-white wall at a distance of eighty feet. George Gaynes is the top-billed star, but the story displaces him from the action very early on. The rest of the cast struggle with a script that doesn't even allow them to perform the schtick that they got down to an art in the other six films.\n\nThe story, such as it is, concerns itself with a Russian crime syndicate that distributes a video game. So far, so good, except the first moment we see when the game is explained involves a newscaster playing it on a Nintendo Gameboy... that doesn't have a cartridge loaded into the appropriate slot. It gets worse from there. Claire Forlani gets the thankless task of portraying Charlie Schlatter's love interest. Given that she doesn't draw attention to her poor acting, even trying to act off a guy who looks more like Alfred E. Newman than police officer material, she must represent the Good Actor quotient of this episode. The plot is not a whole lot better. I can understand Charlie's character going into the crime boss' hideout undercover, but I'd like to know how it is that almost the entire rest of the squad show up.\n\nRon Perlman and Christopher Lee also get a turn to injure their careers here. Lee's performance is fairly quick and to the point, giving a bit of exposition to explain why the Russian police would solicit the help of these goofballs. His screen time is minimal, but it's not enough to add this film to the list that have left Christopher Lee wanting to fire his agent. Ron Perlman gets a great deal more screen time, but thankfully he manages to convince the audience, in spite of the layers of crap, that he really can act. While you're watching him, however, spare a thought for G.W. Bailey, who has tried so hard to find credible work outside of this ridiculous franchise, all to no avail.\n\nTo be fair, the film is fairly reasonably shot. The photography, while not nearly as brilliant as that shown in Sergio Leone films, is competent enough to demonstrate why the only way to present a film is in the intended aspect ratio whenever the option exists. The dialogue, while horribly stilted, manages to get the story across. I wonder if it is just a coincidence that the character name Konali is so similar to that of a video game developer (Konami). I also wonder if the Russian gymnast police were originally intended to make grunting sounds similar to the bleating of monkeys. The last strength of the film, as is always the case where Police Academy is concerned, would be the incomparable George Gaynes, although one has to wonder if he was in full possession of his faculties from around the time he signed his contract.\n\nI gave Police Academy: Mission To Moscow a one out of ten. Don't act like you're surprised. This is without a doubt one of the worst films ever made, and its place on the IMDb's bottom 100 is well-deserved. Its best purpose is as a present for someone you're not fond of."

I never thought I'd miss Steve Guttenberg but I really did and David Graf is no substitute. Michael Winslow is the only one I have any remaining liking for and even he's more annoying than funny here. Poor old George Gaynes and G.W. Bailey play out the same tired gags that they've been running since the first instalment.\n\nIt's fair to say that I never laughed once during this puerile gag-fest in which all the jokes are well telegraphed, the slapstick is painful rather than amusing, and the acting embarrassing. This is the infamous POLICE ACADEMY that Christopher Lee appeared in as a favour, although thankfully he's not on screen too much. As for Ron Perlman's villain...well, Perlman has made his disdain of the movie widely known, so there's not much more to be said than that."

The few jokes that could pass as humorous are the recycling of the previous films in the series, so this is not particularly funny either. But for reasons I can't explain, I liked this movie better than the previous three. While four to six made me yawn, this one relaxed and somewhat amused me.

The 2016 movie was bad enough but just the trailer of After Life made my eyes roll. How about that latest Vacation movie? Mission to Moscow is at least as good as those and it has an advantage those movies didn't have. This doesnt try so hard to be something its not. Good.\n\nThis movie is lousy compared to everything else already done in the series. I liked the Police Academy movies when they were new to cable. Granted my age was still in single digits in those days and Id grown out of cartoons by then. I remember seeing 2, 3, 5 and 6 often on Cinemax and I do mean often. Paid Cable had a tendency to beat to death certain movies. There is a nostalgia around them like sitting through Twins, Memories of Me, Money Pit, Punchline, Awakenings, Air America, Weekend at Bernies and Who's Harry Crumb? All movies played out beyond anyones comprehension on cable, But Mission to Moscow? I didnt know that existed until years later because it was direct to video. Now that Ive seen it, I can at least say Ive seen it.\n\nWhat everyone says about it is true. It was all done before and better in these movies with a fuller ensemble cast and when the gags weren't worn out yet. I wouldn't recommend watching this one. Really the backstory about the making of this is far more interesting and would have been an excellent documentary. Not many comedies are produced in the middle of a civil war. I found myself imagining what was happening behind the scenes when I should have been laughing at the jokes. It is also interesting to see Russia instead of Toronto like most of the other movies.\n\nAnother advantage this movie has over the overdone but still bad remakes is you can at least see some of the original cast, half of which are gone now. Indeed, David Graf has been gone for nearly 20 years now.\n\nAgain, its bad but in the present day context of what Hollywood tries to revive based on name recognition alone, it is at least as good as most of them..."

The Russian setting doesn't work really well for me, it's a little bit forced or something. It's interesting that Christopher Lee was in this film. I've never seen him in a comedy.

        "review_detailed_main": "Ah, so here we are. Rock bottom. The Police Academy series has been through a lot of ups and downs over the years. They seem to have been hugely popular during their times of release, and really, if you look at the numbers, it's not hard to see why such a prodigious stream of sequels was made. The first movie was made for a budget of around $4.5 million and brought in a stupendous $81 million at the box office. The second movie brought in $55 million, part 3 brought $43.5 million, part 4 $28 million, part 5 almost $20 million, part 6 a meager $5 million, and Mission to Moscow proudly raked in a whopping $126,000. If nothing else, the Police Academy franchise stands as a perfect example of a film series that was played out until it was officially a very, very dead horse.\n\nThe awesomely moronic plot this time involves a Russian mafia boss named Konstantine Konali (played by none other than Ron Perlman, now better known as Hellboy), who is marketing a video game that he plans to use to secretly distribute a computer virus that will allow him to hack into government security systems and like, take over the world or something. The movie opens with a scene that is meant to show us how purely addicting this game is. We see a news report where a woman is giving her news report, and her co-anchor, a man in maybe his 50s or so, is sitting next to her oblivious what's going on because he's so entranced by the Game Boy he's playing. I imagine we weren't supposed to notice that there was no cartridge in the machine he's playing, but no matter. I'm willing to let that go in order to enjoy the avalanche of stupidity that was to follow.\n\nSo why are the members of our beloved Police Academy in Moscow in the first place? Well, it seems that the Russians need help in dealing with the Russian mafia, so they have recruited the help of the most famous police academy in America. And mostly the gang is all here except for Mahoney and Zed, both of whom I am sad to say are missed.\n\nLassard, of course, is his usual self, so he has gotten himself lost and ends up at a Russian funeral within a few hours of touching down in Moscow, so the rest of the team occupies themselves with trying to compile evidence against Konali while Harris follows along two steps behind waiting to jump in at just the right moment and claim credit for everything.\n\nAs usual this provides plenty of opportunities for bonehead comedy, but they just pulled out all the stops with the low brow humor this time. Harris and Tackleberry end up dancing in full make-up and costume in a Russian ballet in one of the movie's most embarrassing scenes, Harris attempts to spy on Konali and instead gets a dog peeing in his eye through a periscope, and Jones has developed the ability to open safes with his noise effects. Sigh.\n\nIn the movie's defense, it does have it's moments. Well, it has it's moment, anyway. There is a scene where Tackleberry jumps at the opportunity to give a speech to the Russian authorities about American law enforcement tactics, and he launches into a vicious beratement of the piddly \"excessive force\" policies that are tying his hands back in the states. Yeah, the movie is spectacularly stupid, but this might have been one of Tackleberry's two or three best scorns in the entire series.\n\nIf you ever find yourself watching this thing on DVD, make sure to watch the short supplemental video that's included! I have to admit that I have found it particularly interesting and amusing to watch these videos for each installment in the series, where much of the original cast come back together and discuss the movies. I especially love G.W. Bailey (who played Captain Harris), who clearly has grown weary of having ever had anything to do with the series. In the video for part 5, he sarcastically mentioned people who would approach him years later and ask if he still had \"Dork\" tanned across his chest. For this one, it is noticeably difficult for him to conceal his resentment as he talks about his past in performing Shakespeare on stage, and now he's remembered for a dog peeing in his eye.\n\nDon't worry, Mr. Bailey, haven't you seen the box office for this movie? No one's seen it!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Oh how sad is this, I finally finished the Police Academy series, with the first 4 sequels, I was actually looking forward to the last of the bunch, but as it turns out, everyone was right, Mission to Moscow fails and falls flat on it's face. There was no laughing at all on my case and I was actually looking forward to this movie. I loved the first few Police Academy movies, so I didn't see why I couldn't love the last couple sequels, but at this point, I think they were just trying to milk the Police Academy series for all that it was worth. There is only 2 of the original classmates back together and we have Harris, Harris is the only funny character these past couple of sequels. Mission to Moscow really doesn't try and is without a doubt the worst of the sequels and was a waste of my time, the story was weak and the characters were lame.\n\nThe team is sent to Moscow, Russia to help them out with the Russian Mofia and their crimes. The Russian Mofia is distributing video games and is brain washing the entire world with the record breaking sales they are making. But the team plans to go under cover and take down the idiot criminals who are beyond hard to believe that they could even spell let alone take over the world or security systems with their minds. Lasard must try to make sure the team can do this while trying not to embarrass the American cops and their reputations.\n\nPolice Academy: Mission to Moscow, I wanted to trust this movie, I watched it with an open mind and am very disappointed. We only have Harris and Winslow to pick up the team with the laughs, but even they couldn't hold it together enough to make this movie funny. It's just trying too hard and was nothing without the old gang, it would have been so much cooler if they had the original cast back for the last movie, but I don't know if there were plans to make another Police Academy, but I'm glad they didn't. Police Academy: Mission to Moscow wasn't good, I wouldn't recommend it at all, it was lame and a sad ending to a funny series.\n\n1/10"

However, when his team gets there they discover that there are those within the Moscow police department who aren't so keen on obtaining their help. Likewise, \"Captain Harris\" (G. W. Bailey) has his own agenda which isn't necessarily the same as everyone else as well. At any rate, although the movie started off well enough it soon reverted to the same old gags featured in all of the other films in this series and everything-and everyone-seemed to be simply going through the motions. Additionally, nobody really stood out one way or the other either. In short, although there were a couple of fairly entertaining films in this series, the sad fact is that everything has pretty much run its course and the thrill is clearly gone. I have rated this movie accordingly. Below average."

        "review_detailed_main": "Let me just say that, for the record, I enjoyed the Police Academy movies. I even found a few laughs in Number Six, which is by no means an easy feat. Yet I first viewed this piece of cinematic flotsam when I had tonsillitis. My pain tripled.\n\nAgain, the first few P. A. movies were actually okay. The slapstick was good, Winslow's sound effect talents were original, and the characters had life in them. Police Academy 7, however, has eliminated all but the most uninteresting of characters. Callahan is still a one-joke character, Winslow's sound effects have long since become irritating, and the rest of the cast isn't worth noting. I didn't find much to laugh at in this movie. IT was fairly obvious where the humor was supposed to come into play, but it just wasn't there.\n\nI believe this to be a case of beating a dead horse, but to a whole new level. The producers/directors who thought that bringing the Police Academy crew back *again* and not suffer the same fate as Miami Beach weren't beating the horse; they were slapping thing's tombstone. It was a disappointment to see the decline of the series, because it almost destroys the humor of the original three. You can't help but know what the characters will turn out to be, and it just makes for a depressing movie overall."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sometimes it seems producers have a hard time understanding when a movie shouldn't be made. The \"Police Academy\" franchise should have ended in the sixth film, and even then it would be ending up pretty worn out. This film, made several years later, was an effort that was simply needless and certainly leaves no one with good memories.\n\nAfter seeing the movie, I was really sorry that the franchise ended with such a bad movie. It was something that, for me, should have been avoided. \"Police Academy\" was one of the most interesting and successful comic franchises of the 80s, and there are still many people who have fond memories of these films today. I myself, as a child, saw them several times on television.\n\nThe script is perfectly idiotic and a simple excuse to take some of the characters in the film to post-Soviet Russia, where they must help the local police to fight a big mobster who is turning into an oligarch (one of many that, as we know, emerged from the ashes of the communist regime, fat with shady deals in which the Russian people ended up losing). It's an unhappy, poor script made by incapable people. Humor, on the other hand, is completely absent. I don't laugh for a single minute.\n\nThe cast, which until now had been relatively stable (with the absence of several actors starting from the fourth film), had completely collapsed, and most actors refused to be part of this project. George Gaynes is back, but his character, Commander Lassard, looks simply like an old man with Alzheimer's (with all due respect to anyone suffering from this serious illness, don't get me wrong). Gaynes is not funny, and his performance here is disgraceful. Michael Winslow also tries to make some of the jokes he's already used to us, taking advantage of his vocal skills... but he doesn't have the material or time and what he does has no freshness or novelty. Sir Christopher Lee makes a brief appearance in the film, and as far as I can understand, he did so as a favor to the producer. Friendship is a beautiful thing, and also professional courtesy, but I bet Lee won't want to be remembered for this movie (and he certainly won't, he's done better things, as we know). Who ends up standing out in some way is Ron Perlman. The actor, who we know for other, much more dignified works, tried to be funny and give some dignity to his character. Meritorious, respectable, but unworthy of the actor he is. The rest of the cast is not worth mentioning.\n\nAre there any redeeming qualities in this film? To be honest, I don't think so..., but even so, I feel obliged to make a small caveat: I liked the fact that they did a lot of the filming in the real city of Moscow and that they used real Russian extras and Russian speakers. This gives the film a certain authenticity that deserves to be highlighted, and which is most lacking nowadays, where any piece of green or blue screen replaces a real set and saves a few dollars on the production budget. However, it must have taken courage and some dose of madness to try to make a film in the midst of the political and military upheavals Russia was experiencing in those years."

Police Academy's very first straight to video filck. The gang seems wiser than before because everybody else appears to be dumber than they are. The gang is even losing lots of their buddies from other Police Academy movies. Actor Michael Winslow's sound effects are getting too boring. Don't worry, the title designs are better than before. Not even the dearest Police Academy fans would want to watch this movie because of how boring it is."
