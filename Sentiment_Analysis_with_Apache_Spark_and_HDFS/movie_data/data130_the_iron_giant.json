        "review_title": "What more animated movie should be: a thoughtful, funny, touching story.",
        "review_detailed_main": "After seeing this movie, I was overcome by a strange feeling. I realized that I had found a treasure where I had least expected it. The Iron Giant is intelligent, funny, touching, and visually superb, and should show the world that an animated movie does not need to be A) computer-animated, or B) based on a fairy tale to be successful. One of the best American-made children's movies I have seen in a decade: 8.5/10.0\n\nNow, I'm a 17-year-old who is slowly transitioning into the domain of movie buffdom, which basically means that I am watching a stream of movies based on recommendations from friends, critics, and the IMDb Top 250 list. I got this one almost by accident after the local rental place could not find the movie I was really after, choosing it basically on the knowledge that it was the previous project of Brad Bird, director of The Incredibles (a personal favorite). After watching it, I felt like calling up every mother I knew and telling her to have her children (and herself) watch this.\n\nThe Iron Giant revolves around an adventurous young boy in 1950s small-town America who discovers a gigantic robot out in the woods that has arrived on Earth from goodness-knows-where. He befriends the robot, while trying to keep him safe from a nosy government agent. The story seldom lags, with a series of comical adventures connected by the boy's growing relationship with his friend.\n\nThis movie is very appealing as entertainment. The voices are well-done, and the scenery is also terrific. Most importantly, though, is the animation, which is a bright spot from this time period. The characters are well-drawn, especially the Giant, who through terrific design, lifelike movements, and clever small touches (i.e., the eyes) seems both alien and human, imposing and childlike. Furthermore, the animation is comical. I don't know when I have ever seen slapstick or punchlines so well-complimented by the animation. The script, written by Bird and based off the book The Iron Man, is also very well done. Though the movie relies upon a few minor crutches common to children's movies, it is still very original and clever.\n\nOne thing that I must point out about this movie is its morals. Throughout the movie, the main moral of the story, about the Iron Giant learning and choosing to be good, is actually fairly adroitly handled. At no point when the subject comes up, including standard sentimental climax, does the idea seem contrived. Throughout the movie, evidence of Bird's influence by comic books is quite evident, and his ultimate message about heroes (variations of which will resurface in The Incredibles) is relevant and sincere. However, I do have to say that the secondary moral, about the evils of xenophobia and paranoia, both of which are embodied by the movie's antagonist, the government agent and the military, are very politically charged. While this may sound initially controversial and politically charged for a kids' movie (the second of which I do not deny), I noticed that it was in large part a thoughtful spoof of Cold War America, with jokes as well as valuable lessons about \"duck and cover\" and 1950s nuclear edginess that I found very clever.\n\nOn a final note, I do have to point out that this movie had me laughing hard, but more importantly, it brought me closer to tears than any animated movie I can remember (including Bambi), closer than I like to admit. I wish that I had discovered it sooner, and I hope that everyone gets the chance to experience it the way I did."

The bad guy is less evil and more of an authoritarian trying to do their job regardless of emotions involved. It makes for a fun movie for all ages."

Like so many things, should I be so enamored with the technical part of the movie that I am distracted from the content. As I watched \"The Iron Giant\" I realized I had forgotten it was an animated feature. Don't get me wrong. I knew the enormous title character was animated, but the relationships among the characters and the intelligence of the script caused me to forget that these weren't actors. The movie is filled with tender moments, especially as they relate to our feelings of our own mortality. What I enjoyed is that the grownups aren't treated as garden variety bad guys. Even the military, which is nearly always portrayed as evil, finds itself in a contradictory position--having to go on faith. The animation is wonderful, but so are the \"performances.\" No spoilers here, but I think the ending is a lovely tribute to the spirit of the life force in all of us--even those of us not made of metal. See this. It is one of the better movies of the year."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm 25 years old. I have no children. So why am I praising a 'kid's movie' which nobody saw? Because I have never seen a film pack the emotional wallop 'The Iron Giant' provided.\n\nThe film's plot is similar to 'E.T.' - a young boy meets an alien robot from outer space, who is stranded on earth, and runs afoul of paranoid government agents. Not to knock the Spielberg film, but what makes 'The Iron Giant' the better film is that the young boy is the teacher. It is he who has to teach the Giant about the beauty of life, the difference between good and evil, and choices we have to make. The Iron Giant, it turns out, is a weapon, who has to struggle against his own nature. The film has an obvious (and timely) gun control message, but its real message is about the choice we make when dealing with other people. We can use our powers for good or lash out at everyone around us.\n\nI dare not give away the climax. All I will say is that it features a sacrifice absolutely breaktaking and emotionally shattering (albeit somewhat blunted by the ending). The animation is gorgeous, Michael Kamen's score is perfect, and the film beautifully evokes the 1950s.\n\nSadly, poor marketing kept audiences away in droves. All I can say is, to heck with the box office gross. Despite Warner's appearant desire to pretend the film never existed, the word is getting around about what a magical film this is, and I have no doubt it will join 'It's a Wonderful Life' as a film which bombed in theatres but became a classic over the years. See it now, so you can say you discovered it before everyone else did."

        "review_detailed_main": "All too often, \"family films\" are only infantile, simplistic formulas with a few self-referential and pop-culture jokes thrown in to try and keep adults awake. But then along comes something like \"The Iron Giant\", which is sophisticated enough to demand respect while maintaining a mythic and pure-hearted tone that actually does appeal to the kid in everybody.\n\n\"The Iron Giant\" is refreshingly non-Disney in no end of ways. Characters seem real and chosen to fit the story, instead of being a superficial reshuffling of an old formula. The animation definitely has its eye-popping moments, but there are also scenes of great wonderment, pathos, and humour that only top-drawer animation can convey. The Giant itself is a great character, who only becomes MORE interesting as the film continues (another huge break from Disney). No scene is wasted in this film, either; every set piece, even the really funny ones, helps either to establish the \"world\" of the movie, or to advance the plot. At no time do you feel that you are merely waiting for the story to crank up again.\n\n\"The Iron Giant\" is funny, exhilarating, and touching as well. It's sad to see it failing at the box office, as a blunt reminder that the success of films is often in direct proportion to their publicity budget. Hopefully, though, word-of-mouth will come to its rescue. Go see it! Tell your friends! Then go again! (Repeat as necessary.)\n\nP.S. I find myself comparing the Iron Giant character to Martin Donovan's character in \"Amateur\". If there is anyone else on earth who has seen both films you may wish to entertain the notion yourself."

Give this movie a chance - you'll love it!\n\nIs there ANYTHING wrong with it? Well, the only thing that bugged me (just a little) were some close-ups of the characters - these certain close-ups had a \"sketchy\" look a la the movies \"We're Back!\" and \"Balto\".\n\nFortunately, there's very little of this.

        "review_detailed_main": "Animated movies have long been considered strictly for children. The old Disney classics that started it all are indeed aimed at kids, but are still very watchable, even for adults. With the advent of TOY STORY and its countless mimics, animated feature films have taken long strides to be considered worthy of serious attention. THE IRON GIANT is just such an animated piece. The 87 minute wonder is, to put it mildly, incredible. Everything about it is good. I've also never seen so many influences and references in an animated film before.\n\nThis is a movie with a heart the size of the title character. A gentle, gigantic robot is rocketed to earth and befriends a 10 year old boy. The kid has a single mother (voiced nicely by Jennifer Aniston) and he is just looking for a friend, whether it be a squirrel, or even a 50 foot tall machine. The familiar premise is obviously out of Spielberg's E.T. One scene even has the giant reaching out his finger to the boy in much the same way ET did to 10 year old Elliott when he departed this earth. E.T. was an out of this world fantasy that took place on this earth. Here, it is animated and almost just as effective.\n\nIRON GIANT takes place during 1957 in a small town in Maine. The 1950's was a time when the American public was fearful of atomic bombs and the possibility of alien life off the earth. Live-action sci-fi films of the 1950's always depicted the arrival of \"dangerous\" alien life and our efforts to destroy it. THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is an influence on this film for evident reasons. Ultimately, the characters in that classic learn from the extra-terrestrial being and realize the dangers of the A-Bomb. It is amazing to see an animated feature which can relay this same type of message some 50 years later.\n\nA beautiful and touching ode to BAMBI is witnessed about halfway through. It also brings back some tearful moments from the key scene in that great, hand-drawn film. Here, we see both hand-drawn imagery coupled with a computer-generated \"iron giant\". The title character is actually a 3D composition done digitally, mixed with the 2D action surrounding him. There are some highly imaginative shots of the robot mixing in with the film's environment. At one point, he appears to be a lighthouse until the lights begin to blink. I guess robots must blink too.\n\nEnough analysis. I loved this movie. It is ranked #81 on the top list by other user authors for a reason. Not only is it escapist, fantastic entertainment for kids, adults, and seniors alike, it is an animated picture like no other. It combines the joy of SNOW WHITE and PINOCCHIO, the commentary of 1950's science fiction, and the wizardry and laughter of TOY STORY and its sequel. Do not miss this enchanting flick.\n\nRATING: ****"

There wasn't a single thing I hated about the movie, for me it was outstanding on every level. The animation was absolutely gorgeous, with stunning colourful backgrounds and brilliant character animation especially on the Iron Giant himself. The music by Michael Kamen was consistently excellent, and never overpowered the story. In fact at times it even enhanced the drama. And the film has a beautiful message not to mention a sweet story. The characters were delightful, Hogarth isn't annoying at all and the Iron Giant isn't scary in the slightest. Strictly speaking he has to be one of the most gentle and poignant characters in an animated film. There are plenty of effective scenes like the explosive climax and the scene with the dead deer is a real tear jerker. I will admit I was worried initially when I saw the voice cast, but everybody involved did a superb job. Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jnr were perfect, in their most understated performances. Both get stick about being untalented, but for me their vocal contributions in this film suggests otherwise, while Christopher MacDonald almost steals the film as the FBI agent. Eli Marienthal is very sweet and likable as Hogarth too, and watch out for John Mahoney and Cloris Leachman. All in all, an outstanding film, that if you mind me saying so is the best animated film of 1999 and one of the best films of that year too. I may be wrong but I do think it is highly underrated on IMDb. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

It takes you to another world but never strays from reality and when watching it you forget it's animated. The characters are so well written it puts most live action films to shame. If you pass this off as a kids film you will be missing out on one of the most immersing and emotional experiences you can get from a film. The voice cast are perfect, the animation stunning and the fact this film flopped when released is nothing short of criminal. I urge anyone even with only a passing interest in cinema to watch this film and prepare to be amazed. Brad Bird must be one of the best directors working in animation and after seeing the incredibles the iron giant was no fluke."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hmmm, what to say...well.... it was really good. I've seen it several times, and I've enjoyed it immensely each time for different reasons.\n\nAnalytically I find the animation incredible. The characters are extremely alive and quite realistic, not because of incredible drawing, well, actually, yes: the way the characters are drawn, and animated, is incredible. From the jerking, swaying and swooshing of body parts to the magnificent and CONSISTENT use of eyes, eyebrows and cheekbones to show real emotions, it's definite that this movie is a masterpiece in terms of animation. The backgrounds are wonderfully lush, and evoke a wonderful sense of everything that shows fall for the beautiful season it is. I love animation, and I love good looking landscapes, so the artists behind this movie are making a fan out of me very quickly.\n\nI admire (analytically) most of all the enormous apparance of little details in the film: the season sublty changes from fall to winter; the characters are always doing something, even if they aren't directly in focus (the best ad-libbing a director could dream of); I also think in some parts of the movie the little details actually become crucial to the movie's strength and validity (the time and setting of the story help it to make more sense, also, the \"duck and cover\" scene)\n\nYou know, I think it's amazing when sometimes a movie can move you so much, talking about it's good qualities seems like child's play. This is the kind of movie that you can watch over and over and take a long time to get sick of. We all have movies like that, very few can do that to us, but we have them. I'm realising as I write that I like this movie very much, because I've written two or three paragraphs and have not even started talking about the iron giant yet.\n\nThe animation and expression of emotion in the giant, who is a computer graphics animated character, a hundred feet tall and with a certain old time sci fi persona to him, equals and even surpasses it's traditionally animated companions. There were scenes in the movie that the giant almost made me cry because of his expressions. The director, Brad Bird I think, should earn good credit for his work bringing the giant to life. The giant was very organic and fluid, always animated and extremely alive, without really trying to be. After a while it obvious he's not your average rigid robot.\n\nIt's hard not to give away details when you write a lot, but thankfully I haven't really given anything away. I will say this...the movie is about not prejudging things you are unfamiliar with, big or small, and it's about doing what is right and not using gray areas and politics as an excuse not to do the right thing. The movie explores the strange concept of finding friendship, love, and innocence inbetween past guilts and prejudices. It is one of the most well rounded, enriching, thought provoking movies I have seen in my lifetime, and the best part is that it wasn't the visual effects that made me say that...something other feature animation companies have used a a string to lead me on for almost a decade. I feel like I just recovered from an extended brainwashing experiment. I've learned my lesson. No longer will movies that use stunning graphics to redeem themselves be an interest to me. Rather I will watch movies for the messages they give and the depth those movies have. If anything Brad Bird must have tried to make the giant as close in simplicity to the regular animated characters as possible, because you CANNOT tell the difference between CG and traditional in this movie. Exceptional stuff.\n\nI can't imagine anyone I know not liking this movie. I've shown it to a LOT of people, college students mostly, of all races and religions, with different prides and prejudices, the result, amazingly, always seems to be the same: I have some after movie comments here, and I quote:\"Wow!\" ; \"That was NICE!\"; \"That was SO...GOOD!\" ;\"That giant is crucial, dog!\" ;\"It was good...yeah...I liked it!\",; and \"Dang man, that joint TIGHT!\". If you actually read this review all the way, that's nice. Now forget everything I bumbled about and go see this movie, that way you can spent less time writing your own review than you did reading mine."

        "review_detailed_main": "Yesterday was the 60th anniversary of Sputnik's launch, so it was probably appropriate that I watched \"The Iron Giant\", which indirectly deals with Sputnik. The movie has a plot similar to \"E.T.\", with a lonely boy befriending a being from outer space. In this case, the setting is 1957 Maine (so could this accidentally represent Stephen King's childhood?) and the being is a giant robot whose origin and purpose never get revealed. Sure enough, a government agent starts prying.\n\nI was surprised to learn that the executive producer is none other than Pete Townshend of The Who. The last person whom you'd expect to be involved in the production of a movie that pokes fun at 1950s movies about aliens (the movie also has a scene where the kids are in school watching one of those duck-and-cover movies). The whole issue of a possible nuclear war looms large in the background (and nowadays, it looks more possible than ever).\n\nWhen the movie got released, the ads made it look like something to avoid at all costs. It turns out that the movie isn't half bad, despite the occasional crude humor. Not any sort of masterpiece, but still OK.\n\nThe cast includes Jennifer Aniston, Vin Diesel, Harry Connick Jr. and Cloris Leachman."

It's supposed to be for children, yes, but even older audiences can appreciate a film like this. It has aspects of wonderful science fiction action and adventure. I would say its a somewhat emotional movie as well. The giant is obviously sent to invade the earth and attack humans, but because of the \"bump on his head\", he has forgotten his mission and is, as a child, slowly exploring the world around him and beginning to understand the facts of life. I've seen this film literally about 50 times since I was a kid, to the present day, and I can safely say, even watching it as an adult, that its a wonderful movie for the family of all ages to enjoy together."

To this day i considered Lion King the greatest animated film of all time...until last night. I always remember seeing Iron Giant advertised but never bothered to watch it. Last night I was blown away! I usually put something on for background viewing while I go to sleep but Iron Giant had me hooked. I was naive thinking this was just a kids film. The animation is beautiful, the story is gripping and the characters are genuinely believable. When I saw that the film had a backdrop of the cold War I was surprised but its made so well that even in this modern age of over sensitivity it can't be criticised any sane or rational individual."

I recommend this movie to everyone. It's not just for kids. The animation, editing and soundtrack is amazing. I am a huge fan of Disney movies, but I cannot think of a Disney movie that can touch the Iron Giant on any level. This movie can be enjoyed by kids, parents and non-parents alike. It's not just a great action movie with great writing it will also touch you on an emotional level as well. I have been waiting and watching for a sequel, but I don't think anyone involved in this production intended to do another (even though the ending leaves that wide open). This is the type of movie I wish Hollywood would do more of, instead of re-makes and movies based of TV shows."

        "review_detailed_main": "This was one of my favorite films growing up and it holds up extremely well. Apparently, this bombed during its initial release, as it was caught between the old ways of animated films and the new breath of fresh air in Pixar. Brad Bird will become well known for the latter's stellar films, but his directorial debut may be his crowning achievement.\n\nSet during the height of the Cold War in the '50s, the story follows a young boy named Hogarth, who lives with his single mother in a small town in Maine. He's obsessed with science fiction movies and comic books and finds a paternal relationship and friendship with an otherworldly giant robot. The film balances its obvious E.T. inspired storyline with its Superman-esque inspiration as well. It's seeped with 50's iconography and mood too, giving the audience a lot of insight into the Cold War and the red scare that was so prevalent at the time the movie was taking place. Its period piece offers much more subtext than a traditionally animated film.\n\nEvery character is charming and well rounded, whether it be Hogarth himself, Annie, Kent Mansley, Dean, or the Iron Giant himself. All the voice actors do extremely well too, especially Vin Diesel in the titular role, whose soft-spoken giant's relationship with Hogarth is the emotional backbone for the film. The animation and art style is beautiful, and adds to the depth of each character with exaggerated facial expressions, and offers a lot more focus on the emotions of the characters. The computer animation of the iron giant gives it an otherworldly perspective.\n\nThe Iron Giant is one of the best-animated films of all time, and a classic that can be enjoyed by anyone. It's an emotionally warm film full of vibrant animation, great characters, and a story that offers much heart and joy."

I also believe that this is a very important film for kids to watch. It is rare for a children's movie to have such a strong message that isn't just a shallow \"guns are bad\" movie. There are obviously low points (as there are with every movie) but the high points are so high that they make up for the low points and then some. If you are an parent who is hesitant about showing this to their child, just do it. But don't just show them this movie, sit down and watch it with them.

The animation is great and the silhouettes and framing are nearly iconic, unfortunately its story forgets all of what was mentioned in the first sentence of this review and its political messaging falls apart and makes you see the seams in its logic. It then turns to frame itself as being about \"choice\" and \"free will\" despite everything else up until that key moment having signified it was about something else entirely. Fun, but it lacks the script polish that would have turned it into a classic."

Containing a boldly pacifist theme, the film tells a story of a mechanism of war--meant to destroy--that, through the innocence of a little boy, learns to sacrifice in the name of peace and understanding, as apposed to killing in the name of ownership and power.\n\nI hope,as years pass, more and more people come to discover this gem so that they can share their experience with the Iron Giant, as well."

        "review_detailed_main": "Having to compete with Disney, Dreamworks and Pixar, Warner Brother's animation has never been at the forefront of the animation industry. Apparently all they needed was the brilliant Brad Bird to quell any doubt about their capabilities. The Iron Giant is one of the final films to be presented in the traditional animation form, but even this flick had begun the transition to computer generated visuals. A number of characters, including the giant, were inserted digitally over the hand drawn background, taking special care to perform this imperfectly so as to contrast the rougher backdrop. The finished piece is a visually flawless and captivating film and ranks among the best animated features to ever grace the screen.\n\nBrad Bird who began with significant role in The Simpson's cartoon, marks his feature film debut, and would follow up with the even superior films The Incredibles and Ratatouille. The Iron Giant is part political statement, part satire and part family fare, but contains more substance then most children's films, containing passionate and is reminiscent of classics such as ET and The Lion King. Based on the book by Ted Hughes, the tale tells of a young boy in Rockwell, Maine named Hogarth Hughes voiced by unknown Eli Marienthal who, if you must put a face to the voice played Stiffler's younger brother in American Pie, in Cold War era 1958. His mother voiced by Jennifer Aniston, works late shifts at a local diner, his father has been killed (presumably in combat, as we see from a photograph he was a fighter pilot) and Hogarth who has been moved up a grade, finds himself lonely and misunderstood.\n\nOn a stormy night, a mysterious object crashes off the coast, which to Hogarth's surprise (and everyone's for that matter) is a giant metal eating robot. Finding the creature to be as harmless and confused as a young boy, he befriends the behemoth, stashing him away in a local scrap yard, who the owner (voiced by Harry Connick Jr.) is not especially pleased about. After the giants shenanigans begin to be noticed, a federal agent, brilliantly voiced by Christopher McDonald, comes to investigate ands comes to suspect Hogarth may know something.\n\nThe scenes where Hogarth attempts to hide the creature are the most hilarious, one sequence after the giant loses his hand (which can walk on its own once severed) our young protagonist attempts to sneak it out of the house. But don't be fooled, the iron Giant is less comedy then it is bold statement, but don't let this turn you off either.\n\nBird's piece is riddled with political commentary on the Cold War and its effect on America and the society's obsession with warfare, weapons and at what cost freedom can be obtained, issues such as morality and death, and explores the human gift of free will, as both a blessing and as a means to do harm. The Giant, despite having every few lines is surprisingly layered and human, and has an innocence covering an inner evil turmoil. The message that you are who you chose to be is reminiscent throughout the whole film, but it never for a second feels preachy. The climax is a thrilling as any action picture, which I will say may be slightly too violent for younger children, and the closing act is as touching as any committed to celluloid.\n\nThe Iron Giant is a dazzling tale and complex experience which is bound to keep you involved, entertained and will give you something to think about after leaving the theatre. Ranking as one of the best films of 1999, if The Iron Giant marks the end of the reign of the traditional animation style, I say that no finer adieu could be given in this world, or any, dare I say it, beyond this Earth.\n\nRead all my reviews at: http://www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"

Revisiting this classic, I was reminded of the power of storytelling and its ability to transport us back to our childhoods. This heartwarming tale of friendship and understanding between a young boy and a giant alien robot evokes a sense of nostalgia that's impossible to ignore. The film's themes of innocence, trust, and the fear of the unknown make it a must-watch for both kids and adults.\n\nThis film is a testament to the brilliance of Brad Bird's storytelling and the emotional depth that animated movies can achieve. It seamlessly blends humor, action, and heart to create a memorable experience. The relationship between the two main characters is beautifully portrayed, teaching us valuable lessons about acceptance and empathy. Vin Diesel's voice work as the Iron Giant adds an extra layer of charm to the character. 'The Iron Giant' is a prime example of how animated films can transcend age boundaries and deliver a timeless message of friendship and understanding."

        "review_detailed_main": "At the preview for \"The Iron Giant\", my kids could barely hold their excitement. They've seen the commercials and knew several of the characters already. In advance, I had warned them that there weren't any sidekicks or catchy songs as they've been accustomed to. By the end of the film, their eyes were downcast...and it wasn't from sleep-deprivation.\n\nThe film isn't all that it was hyped to be. Much of what you see in the commercials is the whole film...why go to the theaters? The commercials tell you everything! Moreover, the story isn't widely original, either. If you've ever watched \"We're Back\", \"Pete's Dragon\", \"All Dogs Go To Heaven\" or \"E.T.\" (all children/family movies) then you've already watched this film. It's the typical plot about children who find an amazing discovery, keep it a secret, abuse its powers, and learn to extend beyond their own feelings. For my children, probably the most damaging to the plot, however, was their dislike of the giant itself. There wasn't enough to connect him with the audience which undermines the emotion the rest of the film builds on. Without the connection between such a key character, the audience loses interest.\n\nFurthermore, the movie's animation barely matched with current releases. There weren't as many lush color tones or smooth-running lines to make the film visually appealing. Don't get me wrong, Warner Brothers has had great animation in the past (although its last ventures \"Quest For Camelot\" and \"The King and I\" were complete flops). If they'd only stick with Bugs Bunny, they'd have the works played out in their hands. \"Space Jam\" was wildly successful, plus the shading and colors of \"old\" characters brought new life to their persona. In several aspects, \"Space Jam\" was far superior from animation to plot, aesthetics to witty lines when compared to \"The Iron Giant\". Where past Warner Brothers animation aimed toward the family, \"The Iron Giant\" aimed for the commercial. Several times, the topic of Superman (a character which Warner Brothers owned) was brought up. Soon, we'll see Superman figures lined up with the corny Iron Giant banks and toothbrushes.\n\nLastly, there's the objectional material. For the first time in my life, I saw the main character of a cartoon, feature-length movie use the restroom. The use of the bathroom is all too common in live action films, but they've begun to pass surreptitiously into cartoons. Why does such a scene need to take place? All in all, the film relays an anti-government atmosphere. The main characters are always on the run while officials heartlessly chase its \"victims\". I admit, several children's books are perfect for Hollywood. This one may have been one if taken from a different approach."

It's a very touching story and one with deep meaning. I really like director Brad Bird's pitch \"What if a gun had a soul and didn't want to be a gun?\". I'm glad to see this underrated gem slowly become a classic.\n\nGee, I wonder where they got the idea to cast Vin Diesel as Groot in 'Guardians of the Galaxy'?"

I believe this is based off a book called 'The Iron Giant' or 'The Iron Man' or something. I'm not too sure - never read it.\n\nBy the production studio _not_ being Disney, it really is a no-holds barred scenario. No cushy wide-eyed animals singing in dewy meadows, or bad guys in epics fights missing every blow almost as it were blatant. No, this movie has an extreme sense of emotion, realism, and feeling I only ever felt in one other animated movie (Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust). The absolute jolt in the `emotional quotient' at the end of this movie is a mental roller coaster, it's a hill you know is there but it 'gets' you every single time.\n\nIf there is an \"animated movie gauge\" this should be what the rest measure up to.\n\nIt's a masterpiece."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm going to say one thing. When I first saw this back in 2016, it did seem interesting to me. I thought it would be just an enjoyable sci fi film. But honestly, I did not expect this to be one of my favorite animated movies. The Iron Giant may possibly be the best animated movie Warner Bros has produced worldwide. At first, it seemed it was just gonna have a little cheesy giant monster film. But this is more than that. The story was incredibly written that's about a giant robot that is taught to be a civilized monster. It has profited a lot of character development. And this has presented top notch animation with some of the best effects for an animated film. It's not enough to make a reason how I consider this a masterpiece. It's how heartfelt it is. If you have actually seen monster movies, the setting is in the 50s. And you'll see they normally either take over cities or destroy the world. But this is a lot different. This is about how the giant learns about the world, what happens in life and why everyone would be afraid of him. I'm not gonna spoil it, but let's say that the ending has been a true example. No matter what, you got to watch this film. The one thing that shocked me is it wasn't much successful at the box office. And now many people has given so much attention many years later. Not only is this one of the most underrated movies I've seen, but also one of the most feel good movies I've seen. As the giant himself said it best, souls never die."

        "review_detailed_main": "Neither of these questions is answered in this charming movie, based on a novel by Ted Hughes, but it doesn't seem to matter. The Iron Giant is highly emotional film, but in an understated way. The scenes of 1950s small town Maine were highly evocative without being overly nostalgic. Hogarth is a great role model for young boys, even if he can be a bit impulsive and doesn't always listen to authority figures: he cares deeply for animals, and in this case, his robot friend, whom he looks after and instructs as if a young child. Not having experienced that era myself, the depiction of the Iron Giant nonetheless reminded of postwar Science Fiction covers, as in Tales to Astonish, etc., even if his gentle character did not. And I liked the anti-gun theme: Hogarth's toy gun \"triggers\" the self-defense mechanism in the robot, who gradually learns of his strength and automated programming, and, with the help of Hogarth, fights it: \"I am not a gun.\" I also appreciated the ambiguity of the robot: is it aliens? Russians? Does it matter?\n\nWatched in February 2021, all three of us really enjoyed it. Sienna: \"one of the best we've seen in a long time.\""

To be honest, when I heard about it, I thought the animation looked simplistic and was another straight to video deserving flik.\n\nBut when I actually got to see it finally on TV it blew me away. Not only was the animation actually an artistic and in a few ways a technical achievement (nicely handled discrete use of CGI), the story and dialogue were far more sophisticated than the usual strand of kid's animation. So much so I became far more intrigued emotionally by the characters and the major plot twists then I have been by many live action movies. The humour was also subdued to short well timed bursts, not completely unbearable like some tripe i've experienced. The story is also told in a way that is logical; characters react accordingly to events and everything happens in a way that can't be questioned and is completely understandable, not overly simplified for the younger audience. Plus the ending was satisfying and a great way to round off an unforgettable experience.\n\nIt's a shame therefore that such an emotionally vibrant and surprisingly mature animated movie has to be judged on how good it is just by how much cash it rakes in, a dire fate that many a movie has been subject to. 10/10"

There's also enough humour to keep things a little on the lighter side. But the movie shines spectacularly in its portrayl of a 'friendly giant' and a kid who tries to convince the world that he's harmless. This is a total setup for a very sappy, preachy, and didactic story line, but the film is not like that at all. It comes out with the ingenious of an aesop fable handled with great simplicity and without being a paint by numbers moral lesson. Great for kids and even better for adults.\n\nRating 10 out of 10."

The camera angles and moves were excellent; if this had been a live action movie it would have been superb to watch.\n\nIn summary: Subtle, cool, funny, involving, moralistic, sad, fun, exciting.... this is one to buy on DVD and hand down to the kids as they grow up.\n\nWhen my 2 year old climbs up on the sofa, opens a cupboard, searches out the VHS tape of Iron Giant, rewinds it and puts it on the TV, for the 5th time, you know he likes it.

Best of all, it's nice to see an animated film without distracting musical numbers (don't get me wrong, I like musicals as well as the next guy) because done wrong they will handicap a movie (Prince of Egypt comes to mind. Also, I think it considerable courage to take an anti-violence stance and say something as radical as \"Guns kill people\" (the NRA won't be endorsing this film any time soon). This movie did not fail to deliver on any level and I will be seeing it again.\n\nMichael Eisner may want to cash in a few more of his options while they're still worth something, because if this is a preview of things to come from WB, there is a definite contender for the Disney crown."

It's quite sad at times too, it doesn't hold back on showing real things and even commenting on the atomic politics and such. The relationship with the giant and the kid is really special too.

        "review_detailed_main": "First and foremost, let's talk about the animation. Released in 1999, \"The Iron Giant\" still holds up beautifully today. The attention to detail is simply astonishing. From the intricate character designs to the breathtaking landscapes, every frame feels like a work of art. The animation team truly brought this world to life in a way that captivates audiences of all ages.\n\nNow, let's move on to the heart of the film-the story. \"The Iron Giant\" is a masterclass in storytelling. It weaves together elements of science fiction, adventure, and even a touch of comedy to create a truly unforgettable experience. At its core, the film explores themes of friendship, acceptance, and the power of choice.\n\nThe relationship between Hogarth, the young protagonist, and the Iron Giant is the beating heart of the film. Their bond is beautifully portrayed, and it's impossible not to be moved by their journey. Through their interactions, the film teaches us about empathy, compassion, and the importance of looking beyond appearances.\n\nThe voice acting in \"The Iron Giant\" is another standout aspect. Vin Diesel's performance as the Iron Giant is nothing short of remarkable. Despite having minimal dialogue, Diesel manages to infuse the character with a wide range of emotions. His deep, resonant voice perfectly captures the gentle and innocent nature of the Giant. The supporting cast, including Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jr., also deliver stellar performances that add depth and complexity to the film's characters.\n\nWhat sets \"The Iron Giant\" apart from other animated films is its ability to tackle thought-provoking themes. It addresses the fear of the unknown, the destructive nature of war, and the power of choice in a way that is accessible to both children and adults. The film encourages us to question our assumptions, challenge prejudice, and embrace our capacity for growth and change.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that \"The Iron Giant\" was unfortunately overshadowed upon its initial release. However, over the years, it has gained a well-deserved cult following and critical acclaim. Its themes and messages have resonated with audiences, and it has become a beloved film that continues to inspire and touch hearts.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Iron Giant\" is a cinematic gem that stands the test of time."

        "review_detailed_main": "'The Iron Giant' is a very loose adaptation of Ted Hughes' 1968 children's classic 'The Iron Man'. Whereas the original novel was a poetic and lyrical fairytale that read like modern mythology, Brad Bird's movie is a straight up sci-fi movie in the vein of 'E.T.' Set during the era of the Soviet launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957 and the ensuing Cold War panic, the whole thing looks like the kind of movie that Disney used to make at the time, all beautifully painted backdrops and hand-drawn characters. The evocation of the era is very well done, with a careful and detailed eye for period ephemera and styling. It's a gentle and affectionate movie with a distinct lack of the knowing, adult-oriented, pop-culture referencing attitude of most recent animation. But this back-to-basics approach, while refreshing, seems a little too simple, too na\u00efve, and too superficial. It's a good movie, and one I would encourage children to see, but a lot of rich potential was sorely missed."

While it has a pretty serious tone for an animated movie, it still has a great vibe, and I really couldn't see it as a totally childish movie. I love the giant and Hogarth's dynamic, and the animation. It's got some amazing visuals for an animated movie from 1999. I really wish there were more with that style. As far as storyline goes, it's amazing. It's perfectly paced, and the movie isn't very long at all. There is one extremely sad scene, another reason why it's isn't real good for a childish audience, but it's amazing. This is definitely a top pick for an animated movies list."

With the release of Multiversus, where Iron Giant is a playable character, I decided it was about time I rewatched this classic masterpiece of a movie. And this is probably the best animated movie ever. I love the look and feeling of this movie. It's a world you want to be in. The characters have depth, the animation is classic and the story is emotional and just fantastic. About the animation, I know that now we are experiencing the peak of animation, everything is realistic, we have realistic fur, crazy details in the animation and the line between real life and animation is almost barely visible. But I still prefer this kind of animation. It's animation, it isn't supposed to be real life. But anyways, the story is just fantastic. I never really cry with movies. This movie did cause me to shed a tear at the end. And that's special. This movie is special."

        "review_title": "A mirror held up to humanity",
        "review_detailed_main": "The enigma of the Iron Giant's complex nature is a literary device to make us look at ourselves. The Giant is a mirror of humanity; making him a space alien is a way of bringing another perspective to our human nature. On the one hand, we humans seem to be programmed as death machines. On the other hand, we have compassionate souls. Which will predominate? The key to the whole story is simply \"You are what you choose to be.\" Your innate compassion can override your death program.\n\nThe character of Mansley the bad guy is so malicious as to be actually psychotic. His only function is to show the madness of the human death programming taken to extremes. It makes us look back on the Cold War and wonder what the hell went wrong. The name \"Mansley\" symbolically reflects on Man, who has allowed this insanity to run away with the human race. The Giant's choice of compassion over death programming is inspiring and uplifting; to get that across in a movie any more you have to disguise it as a kid's movie, but this one is equally enjoyable for kids and adults alike.\n\nThe technical side of this film shows the impressive advances in conventional animation, to remind us that computer animatronics are not necessarily the last word in this art form. The most stunning light shows, however, involve weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThe Giant's seemingly miraculous ability to regenerate himself as well as whip out a mind-boggling array of destructive devices reminds me of Arthur C. Clarke's dictum: \"Any technology sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic.\""

Although it doesn't sound like a normal premise for a children's cartoon, The Iron Giant is actually really delightful for kids and parents alike.\n\nCartoons nowadays are sometimes just flashy and noisy, and absolutely torturous for parents to watch. And you'll be hard pressed to find one that actually teaches kids good lessons! The Iron Giant teaches good things. I won't spoil any plot points, but trust me, the lessons are ones you'll want your kids to learn. The last portion of the movie does have some violence, but compared to the loud, flashy scenes of today's movies, it's nothing your kids haven't seen before. And the animation is regular 2-D style, which I believe is better for kids' brains and developing attention spans anyway. When I watch a cartoon, I like it to look drawn by a person, not by a computer.\n\nIf you particularly want your children to be shielded from on screen violence, you can wait until your kids are a little older. Otherwise, it's a really great movie to watch with your sons and daughters!"

And I'm saying that because for unknown reasons, \"The Iron Giant\" was in my greylist. I was missing a gem!\n\nI watched the whole catalog of Pixar and Studio Ghibli, but I think no film portrayed better the pureness and the innocence of a child than this one with Hogarth. What an adorable boy, who builds a genuine friendship with a 15-meter tall robot. A robot that could (or should be) a military weapon.\n\nHogarth's mother doesn't appear much but she's a very difficult character to write: a good fool (I think the only other one I ever saw was the matriarch of the rich family from \"Parasite\"); Dean is one of the coolest adults I saw recently in movies; and Kent Mansley is a sociopath Ed Warren, I can't remember to see this level of obsession in an animated film.\n\nThe story is very simple, it's true, but first, this film is from 1999, it was almost impossible for an animated feature to have a complex story, as this type of production rarely lasted more than 90 minutes; and second, simplicity was not, is not, and will never be a demerit. What makes a film good is its efficience on what it purposes, and I think it's the case here. One of the best anti-war movies of all time."

I took my 5 year old son and since it was a cartoon, I was expecting your standard song filled, goofy side kick, and simple minded story lines many cartoons have. I was expecting to take a nice nap in the cool theater, but that immediately changed when we showed up to the theater. We were a couple minutes late and we came in during the boat in the storm scene. I was immediately impressed with the animation and the very first shot of the the Iron Giant. Any thoughts of a nap went by the wayside and both my son and I watched the movie with complete wide eyed awe. The characters were simple, real, funny, sad, and just perfect. The animation is what really made this movie so great for me and yes, I shed some tears at the end.\n\nIt's amazing that this movie was considered a bomb but it was due to the total lack of marketing and the commercials gave you no idea what the movie was about.\n\nIn 2019, we went to see the 20 year anniversary release at a local theater and it was so great to see again on the big screen. Leaving the theater, I chatted with a long haired, bespectacled older man and I mentioned how amazing the animation was. He said he loves to hear that because he worked on the movie. I asked him what he did on it and he said \"The water\" He did the water in the storm and tidal wave scene. I remember how cool I thought it was when I saw it in 1999, so it was really cool to meet someone who not only worked on the film, but did such an impressive job.\n\nThis movie is one of those films guaranteed to make me cry and it does for pretty much anyone I know who has seen it. I have a running joke with a friend when we have both been drinking and pretty drunk, I will turn to him and say \"You stay.....I go.... No following...\" and every single time he will say \"Oh, you SOB.....\" and start tearing up! Lol.\n\nAnyway........"

I was reminded of Don Bluth and such films as \"All Dogs Go To Heaven\". Not that Bluth made bad films, but by 1999 we were expecting a lot more from our animators.\n\nAnyway, my concerns on animation were overshadowed by a genuinely good film with some fun characters. Not a great film, but one that light-heartedly looks at the 1950s and 1960s Cold War era. This is a satire on a child's level. In some ways, it has a similar feel as Joe Dante's \"Matinee\" (1993) and could make a good double feature."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have seen many promos with this movie on television, and was curious to see it. Sadly, I didn't, so I guess you can say that I was lazy for not seeing it. No matter, I did see this on HBO and watch this many times as it aired as a 24 hour marathon on Cartoon Network when Warner Bros and Cartoon Network were promoting \"The Powerpuff Girls Movie\" with a music video during the end credits of \"The Iron Giant.\" The movie itself feels timeless, and I know this movie will continue to find an audience despite of its failure at the box office when it first came out in theaters. I am more than happy that this movie has a cult following, and there many fans that are embracing it. With that said, \"The Iron Giant\" its about a boy named Hogarth Hughes who lives with his mother Annie a waitress has discovered a giant metallic robot, who fell from space and befriends him. A beatnik artist Dean McCoppin looks out for the Giant at a junkyard, but federal agent Kent Mansley wants to find the Giant and destroy it. The movie is itself is like Steven Spielberg's \"E.T. the Extra Terrestrial,\" but it acts very much its own movie. I continue to love this movie as I watch it, and I see nothing wrong about it. The movie does look gorgeous in widescreen as it gives it a much epic feel to it in a CinemaScope format. As much as we love animated movies in CGI like Pixar or DreamWorks, but I do think its beautiful to see an animated movie to be all done traditionally by hand instead of having it all done by a computer. The animation is again beautiful with all the rich colors, and details that were all put into this movie. I do love how the movie looks as the movie takes place in 1957. The movie does have some funny moments, and I guess a bit edgy for an animated movie that features some curse words. The movie is made for kids, but its something that adults would enjoy. Hey, when I first saw this movie, I didn't expect to hear any curse words in an animated movie which I thought it was going to be a clean animated movie like what Disney did with their animated movies. I guess both Bird and Warner Bros. want it to take it up a notch. The movie is rated PG, and nothing to be worrying about. Or shocking for that matter. I do love the characters, and really love the way they're designed. Also, I thought it had great voice acting. Jennifer Aniston; Harry Connick, Jr.; Eli Marienthal and Christopher McDonald were all really good for their own roles. Vin Diesel, I thought, was perfectly cast for voicing the Iron Giant, and can't imagine any one voicing it aside from Diesel. Michael Kamen's score to the movie is very good, and nothing more that I can say about. I love its story and the direction that the filmmakers went, and I think its perfectly executed. This is Brad Bird's greatest achievement, and should be given a lot of credit for making this wonderful movie. I have heard that Bird and Warner Bros. are both working on bringing this movie for a limited release this year on September the 30th, and October the 4th for remastering it and presenting two new scenes for the movie. This new cut will be called \"The Iron Giant: Signature Edition.\" I am very excited about it, and would love to see this on the big screen like I never had before. I love \"The Iron Giant,\" and I am giving this movie a 10 out of 10."

He has no barriers, because his imagination can take him anywhere... And the same goes for Brad Bird, the director of this animation epic that can thrill you, like in the confrontation between the Giant and the Army or touch you deep inside your heart... There is no way someone can keep their eyes dry or a smile from showing in the face in the ending, when we see that the sacrifice that one robot did for humankind wasn\u00b4t without it\u00b4s reward.\n\nBEST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

It's message, that humanity should not attack everything it fears but has to treat the unknown with respect and kindness is always an important topic and can NOT be overused. Especially children can learn a lot from the film while being entertained with a well written and emotional story. The movie is only one hour and a bit over 20 minutes long, so everybody has the time to watch this.\n\nThe Iron Giant definitely earned it's place in the top 250 movies list and you should watch it if you did not already!

        "review_detailed_main": "Just watched this movie again on DVD with my 4- and 6-year-old boys. Truly this is a great movie for raising all sorts of moral, ethical, and religious issues with youngsters.\n\nWhich leads me to the reason for this post: To respond to the many viewers who are obviously concerned about the \"negative\" portrayal of guns as being \"heavyhanded\" or \"politically correct.\"\n\nSeveral of these viewers quite accurately point out that the depiction of guns is uniformly appropriate. Guns *do* kill, after all, and no one should be shocked to see a hunting rifle used to kill a deer (the hunters themselves are not in the least negatively characterized) or military weapons used in combat (and again, the uniformed military - in contrast to Kent Mansley - are depicted quite positively and professionally). Even Hogarth's numerous toy guns are given realistic treatment.\n\nRegardless of your position on hunting, gun ownership, foreign policy, or whatever, please don't miss the opportunity to use this movie to discuss these issues with your children in context. The Iron Giant, after all, is himself a (the?) super-gun -- that's the whole point of the movie. It's not the gun itself that's good or bad, but the use to which it's put. Guns don't represent evil in the movie, they represent power. And each one of us has in us the power to do great good or great harm, within our families, our workplaces, our communities, and so on. Teach your child to recognize his or her own powers and understand that he or she has the freewill to choose how they are used. Teach your child to be Superman.\n\nAnd of course, like other posters, you will find political and religious themes in the movie, or any number of other things.\n\nI'll say it again -- what a great movie for kids to see. Please don't automatically conclude its message is simply \"anti-gun\" just because guns are depicted being used as intended."

        "review_detailed_main": "There was a preoccupation with paranoia about invasion from aliens that permeated all the science fiction in the '50s. This story builds on that fear by giving us an E.T. sort of encounter with an alien, in this case a super-sized piece of metal called THE IRON GIANT, who is saved from extinction by a little boy who pulls the \"Off\" switch when it appears the Giant is about to be electrocuted.\n\nIt's stunning right from the opening scenes, animated with fresh originality and voiced by some expert actors (HARRY CONNICK, JR., VAN DIESEL, CLORIS LEACHMAN and the little boy voiced by ELI MARIENTHAL).\n\nNot only is the story engrossing, but there's a humanization of \"the creature from outer space\" that defies description. The animators manage to make his thought process apparent with minimal dialog and you can really feel for his emotions when he is asked to perform a noble act (at the climax) in order to save mankind from a fate worse than death.\n\nThere's an effective background score by Michael Kamen, without the songs that seem to irritate some devotees of animated films, and it moves briskly at a pleasing pace that should keep young and old riveted to the sometimes magical events.\n\nBriskly entertaining and well worth watching--among the best of the animated films based on pure fantasy. The very expert voice-overs make the characters seem amazingly real."

The highs for the Iron Giant comes to its script and voice acting, but this may also be its weaknesses. It is not too great, it is not too good. But the Iron Giant is a very good sci-fi film, its about a robot helping this boy, it is really a good plot. Unfortunately, the film does not depict this kind of genre, it slows to a kiddie PG cartoon, that's why I did not like this film. There are better films like Shrek, but I advise you do not watch this film. I give this film a 2/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Based on the poem 'The Iron Man' by Ted Hughes, Brad Bird's first feature length movie, The Iron Giant, tells the story of a huge alien robot who crashes to Earth, where he is befriended by a young boy named Hogarth, but also pursued by a paranoid US government agent.\n\nHogarth proceeds to teach his newfound metal pal about the wonders of life, the tragedy of death, the difference between good and evil, the joys of dive-bombing into water, and the all important moral 'we are who we choose to be'. However, when the boy innocently aims his toy gun at the massive mechanoid, the robot's true purpose is revealed: he is a walking array of extraterrestrial fire-power programmed to respond to aggression. And with the army on its way to apprehend the giant, it looks like the proverbial is about to hit the fan.\n\nWill the robot destroy his enemy with a series of high powered energy blasts from his in-built armoury? Or will he choose to fight his basic programming and become a hero?\n\nFeaturing breath-taking CGI-enhanced animation, flawless direction, and a script that brilliantly and intelligently mixes comedy, action and drama in equal doses, The Iron Giant is an unmissable treat for all ages.\n\nIn true kids' movie tradition, the story has several important messages to tell and a couple of tear-jerker scenes, but it thankfully never resorts to the heavy-handed moralising and saccharine sweet schmaltz of many an animated feature. Instead, Bird delicately handles his themes of anti-violence, freedom of choice, life and death, and sacrifice for those you love. And he does this without once feeling the need for a song and dance number. Nice one, Brad!\n\nThe film also succeeds in feeling very 'real', despite its fantastical premise. This is undoubtedly down to the well developed and likable characters (brilliantly voiced by a talented cast) and the incredible attention to detail in the animation, which not only includes loads of authentic 50s design, but also throws in some great references to the sci-fi movies and comics of the time.\n\nIf the majority of animated features of the past few years have left you less than impressed, do yourself a favour and track down The Iron Giant. Charming, exciting, and ultimately uplifting, it's a film that'll leave you grinning from ear to ear."

        "review_detailed_main": "An enjoyable and inspiring animated film for all ages. This modern fairytale is a story of a great friendship - that of a lively yet warm-hearted boy and a 50 foot iron robot with some very human qualities.\n\nIn 1950s America, post-war suspicion and paranoia give rise to a fear of all things different. A huge robot from outer space is seen as the ultimate threat. Yet one perceptive child discovers that the Iron Giant has the ability to combine superhuman powers with the best qualities of human nature. With the encouragement of his young friend, the gentle giant discovers his soul and learns about trust, friendship and respect for life. But will his true dark purpose lead to the destruction of all he has come to love? Is the power of friendship strong enough to save him not only from the prejudice of others but also from himself?\n\nThis intelligent and moving film has much to offer to anyone who can put their own prejudices against `cartoons' and `kids films' aside. While being good fun for children, The Iron Giant has a depth that adults will appreciate. This is a more `grown-up' kind of animation - no singing and dancing animals and attention-stealing backdrops, no caricature sidekicks or too bad to be true villains; instead we are treated to a fully developed characterisation rarely seen in feature animations. The result is a small cast of believable and engaging characters who draw you into what could have been a predictable plot and who leave you caring about what happens to them. The story is by turns amusing, touching, dark and inspiring. The animation is clever and seamless, but understated, letting the wonderful characters take centre-stage.\n\nA talented cast breathe life into the characters, without turning them simply into animated versions of themselves - unlike some actors in rival films. Hogarth Hughes, the boy who befriends the giant, is given a spirited and natural performance by young X. The powerful voice of Vin Diesel, by turns frightening, funny and heartbreakingly emotional, gives the mysterious yet lovable giant his soul. Jennifer Aniston is utterly convincing as Hogarth's mother Annie - a hardworking single mother desperately trying to be a responsible parent to her imaginative, energetic son, yet secretly in need of some magic in her own life. Harry Connick Jr. gives warmth and humanity to trendy beatnik Dean, a scrap-metal yard owner who turns junk into `art' and works hard at seeming a cool laid-back kind of guy, but hides behind the smooth exterior a caring, fun-loving personality who needs others more than he would admit. Y is the villain of the story, as Kent -, the government official on a quest to destroy the `monster'. Driven by fear, misunderstanding and most of all the opportunity for self-advancement, Kent poses a real threat yet is also amusing and thoroughly believable. It is this thoughtful characterisation that makes the film so special - there are no extremes of good and evil, simply characters not very different from us, with a range of emotion and the potential to become what they choose. The films message, `You are what you choose to be,' reflects not only the inner struggle of the Iron Giant between the desire to do good and the instinct to destory, but the struggle inside of us all to be the best that we can.\n\nI was pleased and not at all surprised to see this animation voted number one in the Children's category on IMDb (April 2000). Kids will love it, and will maybe learn from it's message of non-violence and shaping your own destiny. But, whether you have children or not, I highly recommend this heart-warming and intelligent film. It is so much more than just another feature animation. In The Iron Giant, Warner Bros. has succeeded in avoiding the all too common pitfall of turning an animation into a poor imitation of Disney. They have instead combined their talents to produce a deeper, more intelligent story with a magic that is completely their own."

The film, set during the Cold War, tells the story of a young boy named Hogarth who befriends a giant robot from outer space.\n\nDespite the praise this film has garnered, it simply didn't resonate with me. While the animation is undeniably well-crafted, the story felt a bit too simplistic and predictable for my taste. I found it difficult to fully engage with the characters, and the emotional moments, which many find touching, didn't have the same impact on me. The narrative, while solid, didn't capture my attention, and I found myself losing interest as the movie progressed.\n\nFor those who enjoy heartfelt animated tales, The Iron Giant might be a favorite, but for me, it fell short of expectations.

But no cartoon deserves more praise and acknowledgment than Brad Bird's The Iron Giant.\n\nThe Iron Giant is set in 1957 and stars Vin Diesel as The Iron Giant, an alien machine that crash-lands on Earth and is soon befriended by a little boy named Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marienthal), who discovers that \"Giant\", as Hogarth calls him, eats metal for food. Not long after all this, a government agent (Christopher McDonald) arrives and begins to cause trouble, and soon chaos as he believes Giant to be a foreign weapon sent to destroy America. I have never seen anything like this movie before; constantly heart-warming, family-fun comedy moments (which are great), and an emotionally shattering climax that is truly memorable. If you really love to watch movie and, not only be entertained, but moved, then The Iron Giant is one you have to watch. I would also have to say, Warner Bros. should be ashamed for the bad marketing they did for this movie; just like Brad Bird said, \"They had no idea what they had in their hands.\" This should have won a few Oscars and Golden Globes; it deserves it. 10/10 Stars***"

        "review_title": "The best American animated feature of the last 20 years",
        "review_detailed_main": "Since the release of The Little Mermaid in 1989, Walt Disney Pictures has produced a cavalcade of animated masterpiece after animated masterpiece. That movie's success and the subsequent efforts from the same studio ushered in a renaissance of American animation. Megalomaniacal visionary Steve Jobs' belief in a small computer graphics studio, Pixar was directly responsible for the birth of the computer animation feature movie. Their list of accomplishments reads like a who's who and gave impetus to other creative forces to do the same. Since the seminal Toy Story, DreamWorks and Fox, among others, have followed Pixar's lead in that genre of animation. Yet, given Disney's pedigree and Pixar's mastery, one would be incredulous to learn that the best American-made animated movie of the last 20 years was directed by a virtual unknown (at the time) and was distributed (if you can call it that) by Warner Brothers and not any of the aforementioned masters of the art. That movie is the Iron Giant.\n\nThe story of the Iron Giant is a cross between Beauty and the Beast and ET. It opens in space with a shot of Sputnik panning across the screen and something hurtling from space towards the planet. That something is the title character, a giant robot. Once on earth, the Giant proceeds to dine indiscriminately on the earth's varied cuisine of metal and steel. The Giant is befriended and spared electrocution by a young boy named Hogarth Hughes. The rest of movie tracks the two main characters on their quest to evade detection, have fun, and munch on all the metal that can be had. Along the way, the viewers are treated to a terrific parable about the futility of violence. Set against the backdrop of the early days of the Space Race, the reality of the Cold War helps to contrast the message the movie is sending.\n\nThe day may be fast approaching where computers and animators can replicate the entire gamut of human emotions and characteristics and render a digital \"actor\" as realistic and compelling as any Academy Award winner. What the computers may not be able to ever do though is replicate the raw emotion that can be discerned from the human voice. In The Iron Giant, the emotions that come to the fore more often are joy, exuberance, and wonder. It is a testament to the actors involved in this feature that the characters are so compelling. Eli Marienthal voices the character of Hogarth with such delight that we can't help but wonder what has gone wrong in our world that we can't feel the same level of enjoyment. The fact that the young Mr. Marienthal is given such tremendous material only helps. Hogarth is an optimistic young man; he thinks the best of everyone and everything and one can't help but wonder if such open-mindedness is as a mechanism erected to keep out the rigors of growing up as a latch-key kid in a single parent home. And, his understanding of death as a part of life makes perfect sense when one considers the fact that this child has been subjected to the \"duck and cover\" instructional in school every year of his short life.\n\nIf joy and optimism define Hogarth, then wonder defines the Giant. \"Voiced\" by Vin Diesel, the Iron Giant starts off as a enigmatic brute and transforms into an amalgam of childhood, best friend and parental figure. The young thespian gets very few lines of understandable dialog but those that he does get, he delivers with a tenderness that contrasts the mechanical nature of his character.\n\nAlong with the two protagonists, the rest of the voice work is also excellent. Jennifer Aniston does a good job as Hogarth's single mother, conveying the exasperation a mother must feel when she has to deal with a bright child with an overactive imagination. Harry Connick Jr. is amusing as the beatnik scrap dealer, Dean who Hogarth befriends and who in turn befriends the giant. It goes without say that, given his philosophical tendencies, Dean is the first to accept what Hogarth has to say about the giant's benevolence. Finally, John Mahoney as General Rogard and Christopher McDonald as federal agent, Kent Mansley are also very good. The former comes across as the same sort of caring realist he played in Say Anything without the pen chance for fraud. The latter is positively delicious as a fed that has bought in to all the hype of the Cold War; he is truly drinking the McCarthy Kool Aid. In fact, if he weren't such a despicable guy who does some pretty despicable things, you can almost feel sorry for him.\n\nTechnically speaking, the Iron Giant pales somewhat when compared to some of the other animated features that are its contemporaries. Even from a traditional animation standpoint, there are contemporaries whose craft stands out more than that of this film. And the main story itself is also simple. What makes this movie terrific is its heart. It gives us characters that we care for, human and otherwise and along the way of the story, it tries to teach it's audience profound lessons on fear and on violence as a solution (or, in this case, non-solution).\n\n9 stars out of 10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Back when Sputnik ! was still orbiting, young Hogarth Hughes (v. Eli Marienthal) tries to hide a giant, extra-terrestrial mechanical man that he has befriended, first from a smarmy government agent (v. Christopher McDonald), and then from the U.S. Army. The whole story is pretty trite and features most of the typical sentimental tropes supporting a simple pacifist message (which is a bit undermined when it is established that the Giant only resorts to force when immediately threatened, a response that many people might consider appropriate). The animation and the voices are fine and the titular mecha is a pretty good example of diesel-punk design. Fun film for the kids with a young hero frequently putting one over on the grown-ups, numerous amusing or exciting images, some minor poop-humour, and a satisfying, up-beat ending."

The direction which was made by Brad Bird was very good and he presented very well how friendship would be no matter the differences of each other. He also presented what people can do if they are united and support each other. I highly recommend everyone to watch this animation movie for all the previous reasons but also because I am sure that you are going to love it."

This is the best animation film I have ever seen. I loved Nemo, The Incredibles, Monsters Inc etc, but this film offered so much more in terms of emotional ties. I had tears in my eyes at the end of the film and had to hide my face from the family.\n\nIt is such a wonderful simple story and I cannot believe it did not get the commercial success it deserved.\n\nFor any people with kids or without, please give this film a chance and either rent or buy it. This film is what animation was invented for."

        "review_detailed_main": "Reviewed August 2011\n\nI had great expectations on this from hearsay but doesn't quite live up to all of them. Since I am watching it quite late, it felt like a combination of 'How to train your dragon' and 'Super 8'.\n\nA huge robot descends from the sky and has a rocky landing that makes it forget what it is. It reaches a small sedate village looking for metal to eat when a boy stumbles upon it and saves the giant from getting electrocuted. The giant grows an affection towards the boy and the boy teaches him words and general human stuff. When the government comes to know of it and comes with it's big guns, the giant has to remember what the boy has thought him.\n\nThe animation and mannerisms of the characters are very Disney like swaying away gaily. The story centers a lot on friendship and righteousness while the robot structure is too corny. It has to eat metal to survive, shows those funny expressions while showing emotions etc. Some action sequences at the end are pretty decent though.\n\nThough it is done with right intentions, it is strictly a kids movie."

There are several instances where the characters use \"colorful\" language that kids under 14 probably shouldn't hear. Check the \"Parental Advisory\" page here on IMDb for the exact words and occurrances. You'll be surprised. We watched about 15 minutes of this till the first \"who the hell\" popped up then decided it wasn't really the show for us. No wonder it bombed at the box office. I'd have walked out had I been sitting in a paid-for seat with my kids in tow. It's sad too, because the wife and I watched it later and it was a decent movie. Maybe they should change the marketing strategy when something like this is released so it's NOT specifically targeted to younger viewers. It'd keep us *real* parents from having to stop the movie midway through."

Toy Story 2 and Shrek are my all time #1 CGI movies, but The Iron Giant (which I thought would suck) turned out to be the biggest emotionally affecting 'cartoon' I have ever seen, its even more of a tearjerker than the ending of Monsters Inc.\n\nBeautifully animated and expertly executed, I was in both tears and perched on the edge of my seat for the last twenty minutes.\n\nAs of writing this review the movie is ranked #235 in the top 250, I strongly agree with its placement among the best movies of all time, but strongly disagree why it's not within the top 100. I have noticed one or two people (mentioning no names) have rated the movie a 1/10 simply because they disagree with its ranking, despite admitting they enjoyed the movie. Henceforth I have voted it a 10/10. Which incidentally is my rating for the movie :)\n\nPlease just buy the DVD, for a mere \u00a310 or less (or $12 if you are in the US) get this movie. I can't possibly imagine anybody would not like it, it's superb.\n\n10/10 - AN ABSOLUTE CLASSIC!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The short answer is I think not. This is the story of a young boy named Hogarth that grew up in the 1950's. His dad is not in the picture and we can deduce that he dies in world war two from a picture Hogarth has. Essentially friendless, Hogarth has a vivid imagination and a sens of wonder that we all lose as we age. He discovers a giant robot and befriends him. Yes, in similar fashion to ET, the Hogarth tries to hide the giant from the authorities. Also like ET, he fails. However unlike that movie there is a great conflict between the giant and the military.\n\nThis is a very heartwarming story and I am forever sad that there was never a sequel made to it, as it was worthy of another visit, yet the box office earnings were too low. My only problem with this film is that it is clearly meant to dissuade people from owning guns. Typical Hollywood bull, jamming their beliefs down our throats. All in all, this was a great movie though."

        "review_title": "Brilliant animated feature, easily one of the best animated films of the 1990's",
        "review_detailed_main": "The Iron Giant is one of the best animated films of the 1990's. It has everything you could ask for in a movie and it covers some great topics. It covers topics such as cold war tensions, childhood, and it even has an underlying message about anti violence and being yourself.\n\nThe story follows a gentle robotic giant who befriends a young boy. The giant has no recollection of his origin, or what he was designed for, but the young boy, Hogarth Hughes, tries to teach him about things, similar to how a parent teaches a little kid. At the same time, Hogarth also tries to hide the Giant and protect him from anyone who wants to destroy him. Unfortunately, not everything is well. A shady government agent is bent on trying to find the giant at all costs.\n\nThe animation is very colorful and very well drawn. The voice talents are all very good. What's interesting to me is how Vin Diesel, who later went on to be in action movies like Fast and the Furious and xXx, was the voice of The Iron Giant before all of that.\n\nThis movie has a great story, and there is a good message underneath it all.\n\nKids should definitely see this, and adults should too. Even though it looks like a kids movie, adults will be able to get something out of it and enjoy it as well.\n\nAnother thing this movie pulls off that many cartoons are unable to is to make you feel certain ways. When Hogarth and the giant are playing around and doing fun things, it puts you in a good mood. Later in the movie, when certain things happen to certain characters, you feel the way they feel.\n\nDirector Brad Bird later went on to make the excellent animated movie, The Incredibles. He has made some good movies, so I hope he can make even more good movies.\n\nThe Iron Giant is a brilliant animated movie, and as I said before, it has great animation and a great story, along with memorable characters, and a great underlying message. This is easily one of the best animated movies of the 1990's, and it has great elements. There is humor, but smart humor, not mindless fart jokes. There is never a dull moment, or a dumb moment. At certain points, there is action. Normally action at the end of a movie makes it that much more entertaining. It's very rare when you find a cartoon with all of these elements, and when everything works out perfectly. I recommend this for anyone, kids or adults, even teenagers."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm so glad that I finally found this masterpiece five year after this movie has been released. This is a really great movie and in my opinion it's one of the best animated movies ever made. I think the biggest flaw of the Disney animation is the complete lack of human characters. Disney and now Dreamworks made movies about fishes, sharks, bears, lions, dogs, bugs, ants, toys, superheroes and many other animals and creatures but you can hardly find single movie with human character from a real life . Well, all their characters can talk, feel and behave like humans but it is not the same. Most of their recent movies were good, funny and entertained but at the same time they look a bit childish and not so emotional, even cold. They are typical commercial stuff and with strong marketing studios often get good box office returns. The Iron Giant is a different case. This is a very intelligent, good-feeling and enjoyable animation with powerful and clever moral messages in its core. At first sight it looks like a kids movie but it's a wonderful movie both for kids and adults. In fact the movie idea could have been unnoticed for small kids. The story happens in 1957 in small town in Maine. It was a years of the cold war and military paranoia, a period of total fear and misunderstanding from both sides. It was really amazing to watch how brilliant was recreated the atmosphere of that period. All begins than the Hogarth, a young fatherless lonely boy found near his home mysterious Iron Giant. I think it was s a clever idea what we'll never know where this giant come from. Different and unknown doesn't always mean bad and enemy. Hogarth helped him and they become friends. He gave Iron Giant some moral lessons and even taught a basic English. But when in the town comes paranoiac special agent Kent Mansley they friendship now is in a danger. He wants to kill the Giant without any reasonable reason, just because he think what this strange robotic Iron Giant can be dangerous. Most surprising and intelligent element in the story was the fact that this movie didn't become a cheesy childish anti-gun propaganda. The message is more wise and intellectual. As Hogarth said we are what you we choose to be. Our acts are always our individual decisions and some things can't be simply bad or good, and only our choice can decide how we can use them. Also you can find in this movie many other strong philosophical ideas and thoughts. Overall, the story of friendship between young boy and The Iron Giant is very touching and emotional.\n\nNow about animation. It was absolutely fabulous. All movie is an amazing work of art. The Hogarth character so perfectly drown that you can easily forget that it's an animated movie. He looks like a real, well acted boy. I have seen almost all famous animated movies and I suppose he is a best animated character I have ever seen. The rest of main characters also very impressive, landscapes, sky and all minor details like ships and tanks were beautiful and looked absolutely real. The Iron Giant was the only computer-generated character and he didn't look as a soulless machine. He becomes a very warm and likable character.\n\nWith excellent characters development and interesting story The Iron Giant is an extraordinary intelligent movie. Sometimes it's funny, sometimes it's sad but it's always enjoyable, touching and entertained movie. If you haven't seen it before just go and buy, rent or borrow it. I recommend The Iron Giant to all people irrespective of their age. A solid ten. Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad English."

Set during the period of time when Cold War and sci-fi paranoia was prevalent, The Iron Giant embraces these themes and stokes them with lessons of friendship, hatred, death and pertinent reminders of pacifism. Directed by Brad Bird and scripted by Tim McCanilies and Andy Brent Forrester, The Iron Giant is one of those rare animation animals that delights the kids as much as it does the watching adults. Though the actual giant himself, with all his dazzling weaponry, is the star attraction on show, it's the iron colossus' inner conflict that gives the film its heart. Aided by his friend, young Hogarth, good old iron decides he doesn't want to be a big weapon, but the authorities, as is nearly always the way, just can't let it be. The unflinching attitude that ran through many of the 50s sci-fi schlockers was one of being \"because we don't understand it, lets destroy it\" is something that Ted Hughes and the film makers here capture perfectly. Sophisticated and intelligent in its approach and delivery, this is definitely one of the better animated film's from the modern age. 9/10\n\nVoice work comes from Jennifer Anniston, Harry Connick Jr, Vin Diesel, James Gammon, Christopher McDonald, M. Emmet Walsh and Eli Marienthal."

Aside from this their efforts have been somewhat useless. Content for a long time to release other peoples animated movies such as [Thumbelina] and [The Pebble and the Penguin] (go on, have you seen them?) they decided, on the strength of [Space Jam]'s success, to reopen their famous theatrical animation department in the hope that they could recreate the legendary success of their 50's short cartoons with full-length animated features. Their first effort, [The Magic Sword: Quest for Camelot], boasted as many words in the title as there were famous names in the voice cast but, sadly, boasted almost nothing else. Except that there were almost as many words in the title as there were people who went to the cinema to see it.\n\nSo, it is somewhat of a surprise to find Warner Brother's Feature Animation department releasing this upon an unsuspecting movie world, for this is the finest animated feature-length film to be released that has nothing to do with the mighty Disney studios (as of February 2000 and, it should be noted, that the key animators on this movie are all ex-Disney). Forget DreamWorks' glossy but botched [Prince of Egypt], forget Steven Spielberg's over-rated executive-produced [An American Tail], forget the excellent [Antz], forget even [Toy Story] and [Toy Story 2] (both co-financed and released by Disney anyway). The Iron Giant is cinema's finest non-Disney animated feature length film. It is a real shame that so few people saw it. Here's hoping that the home video market will discover this real gem."

The animation, using the more traditional approach, is impressive and most importantly adds to the story instead of becoming the story. The ending will make you get that tingly feeling that I believe tells you that the emotional story is effective. If you are a fan of the book you have nothing to lose, if you like the story, you win and if you don't well the book's still there. Oh and its Vin Diesel's best film to date."

Hardly surprising as he claimed to have been rescued by an hundred foot robot with bright yellow eyes. \"Hogarth\" is an enthusiastic young lad who wants to keep a pet. His mother (\"Annie\") is having nothing to do with this, especially after one of his candidates manages to just about wreck the diner where she works and turn scrap man \"Dean\" into \"Deana\" in the process. Dejected at home alone, he hears some strange noises and armed with his pop gun and a torch, sets off into the forest to find the source. When he discovers that the fisherman's tale wasn't so long after all, the pair begin to bond and the story takes on a familiar look. It does have shades of \"The Day The Earth Stood Still\" as it shows clearly the typical reaction to something strange, new and big - the government and the army are soon in hot pursuit with little intent on diplomacy but with plenty of tanks, missiles and ultimately the \"bomb\" - just as destructive to them as to the \"monster\". It's really the characterisations that help this stand out. The style of animation is simple yet potent, the creature positively emanates a degree of decency and charisma and the relationship with the young boy that manifests itself to us is one that amiably resonates whether that be with a real friend, an imaginary one - or one from outer space who doesn't much like guns and has an almost infantile approach to life. Proof that when you have a solid story and tell it well, the gadgets, gismos (and there are a few, here) and visual effects don't matter so much as the soul of the thing."

Iron Giant is a no name robot who's origin and purpose for creation is unknown, but is surprisingly innocent and powerful. It has a sense of purpose and has loyalty and decency we don't even see in ourselves until it is provoked and shows what it might have been created for - weapon of mass destruction. Who created the Iron Giant with its heart of gold and body as indestructible weaponry ? Was it part of an unknown robot army from another planet that got strayed from its squadron ? The story leaves lots of plot holes that beckons us to know more about this character. Would the writer of this story do a sequel that fills in all the gap in the robot's back ground, and help us look deeper into its character ? It seems to be one of the best character to come along in many years. Although the scope and the period setting is similar to \"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\" this animated character is much more lively, and thought provoking."

        "review_detailed_main": "Earth 1957. It came from space. A giant metal-eating robot crashes to Earth.\n\nIn films like 'E. T. The Extra-Terrestrial' the little alien's goal was to get back home again, and he was trying to contact his kind. In 'The Iron Giant' there seems to be nothing driving the robot/The Iron Giant.\n\nWandering through the forest, the robot stumbles upon a power station and starts eating the metal tower. However, he gets electrocuted. A young boy, Hogarth Hughes, who went into the woods after seeing strange lights, saves the robot by turning off the power.\n\nAs a result, the robot follows Hogarth. Hogarth teaches the robot to talk, and they become inseparable friends. It is a beautiful story of a most unusual friendship, but I still felt the film lacked a driving force. It was fun seeing Hogarth and the robot together, and it was absolutely hilarious when Hogarth tried to hide to robot from his mother in their home.\n\nThe film's antagonist is Mansley - a government agent who wants to destroy the robot. Being an animated movie, I expected it to be cartoonish at times, but luckily it never was, nor was it slapstick. 'The Iron Giant' is actually a very special little film with a message of friendship. The third act is action-packed and heartfelt. I found it exciting and definitely entertaining."

Why is it there?\n\nI said it's a fine STORY; as far as the telling of it goes, something is lacking. I'm not sure animation was the right medium for it. It's fashionable to decry Disney's reliance on such things as fairytales, fantasy, anthropomorphic animals and musical numbers - but these, after all, are the kind of thing that can indisputably be done WELL with animation, and there's nothing wrong, surely, with making sure that form matches content. But animated science fiction like \"The Iron Giant\" never quite works. (No, not even when it's done by the Japanese.)\n\nThe giant itself is a masterpiece: the precise angles of every spring and hydraulic chamber have been calculated by a computer, then outlined so as to match the hand-drawn characters ... indeed, I get the feeling that the giant could not have been portrayed any other way, which, I'm afraid, means that the film was doomed, since when the humans are drawn and animated and characterised so as to match him, they don't have any life.\n\nIt's a noble, honest attempt (apart from the ending), pleasing to look at and certainly worth seeing. The extravagant praise heaped upon the film at the time of its release is probably due to the fact that it HAD just been released, and people hadn't had time to forget it. Surprisingly little time is required."

Arriving from an unknown place at a time filled with post-war fear means that most people immediately fear the giant, even though he's as friendly as can be thanks to a bump on the noggin and a heavy dose of electricity. It isn't just his initial trauma that keeps him kind, though; it's the teachings of our protagonist, who firmly instils a sense of self in the being and tells him that killing is wrong. The first half of the flick is basically about the blossoming relationship between its two leads, which is charming and well-paced. The second introduces some resonant themes - regarding choice, discrimination and, even, what it means to have a soul - and brings its antagonist, a selfish and nationalistic government agent, further to the forefront. This all builds to an effective finale that successfully pushes the movie's message of tolerance and the ability to choose who you are. Its final emotional punch really is as impactful as its reputation would have you believe. In general, the film doesn't seem as though it panders to kids at all; it tells a relatively grown-up story that should appeal to all members of the family. It's a beautifully animated adventure with a giant heart at its core. 7/10."

There are obviously no opening credits to the film so guessing the voices is cool fun. But it's impossible to guess who plays the Iron Giant.\n\nBut the Iron Giant himself is a wonderful hero. It's cool to watch him learn simple things and having him eat cars is a neat little characteristic. I like when he's bored and he plays with the hood with one of the cars in the junkyard. You cannot dislike the Iron Giant.\n\nI think it was a wise and creative decision to make this cartoon in 2.35:1. Most cartoons by Disney are in 1.85:1 or even worse\u0085in 1.66:1. Warner did a great job with this movie. These days it seems that Dreamworks SKG and Disney seem to do all the feature length animations. But Warner beat them all in 1999 with this movie.\n\nMy only gripe is that it should have been longer. At 87 minutes, it's all over too quick. But it's still cool."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Iron Giant (1999) : Brief Review -\n\nBrad Bird gives an extra push to the evergreen stories of King Kong and ET with his mechanical-animated-classic. Mercin Cooper's timeless classic \"King Kong\" (1933) and Steven Spielberg's groundbreaking classic \"ET: The Extra Terrestrial\" (1982), have been loved by the critics, audiences and even kids. We know the basic stories of these two films: a monster/creature arrives in human society and then humans try to beat him up, despite the monster/creature being harmless. King's tale had a girl factor, ET had a kid factor (along with his family and friends), and even Brad Bird's Giant Iron Man story has a kid again, along with his mother and an adult companion. Just like in those two stories, we have a creature here who enters human society, becomes friends with the kid, and then the defence system tries to attack him for no apparent reason. But there is an emotional boost in the climax, which is quite an intelligent mix of Kong and ET's endings. As we know, Kong dies and ET leaves, and here we have a sort of mix in The Iron Giant. Bird actually plays a smart trick of having a happy ending just after the sad one, which leaves us emotional, especially the kids. It was for the sequel. Yes, I get that. \"You are what you choose to be. You don't have to be a gun. Gun kills,\" says Hogarth. That was some quote for a small kid, no? I also loved the aggressive factors shown by the writers that the robot is ready to destroy the one who harms him. He is not too soft like the regular protagonists we see in such stories. The human belt is terrified to see it, and that's what shows us our lameness. The voice cast is fine, and so are the visual effects. Overall, a superb adaptation of timeless tales with a beautiful machinery touch to it. Much much better than your popular \"Iron Man\" from the Marvel Cinematic universe.\n\nRATING - 7.5/10*"

The voice talents are well cast with Vin Diesel doing a great job voicing the giant. The animation of the giant is also good with the last act of the film, when the giant shows a new side, being easily as good as Disney could manage.\n\nFor me, the film is made by the story and the issues raised, especially the ending which always brings a tear to my eye.\n\nAll in all, go and rent this film, it not just for kids but for the whole family.\n\n10/10"

It does not have a plethora of sound-alike songs written by a big name in sound-alike songwriting, instead it has a pleasant background of songs true to the setting. It does not have the \"Disney Romance,\" a major relief. Most importantly, The Iron Giant does not talk down to its audience. The characters had multiple dimensions to their personalities, a feature rarely given to animated characters, details of real people (note Hogarth's crooked tooth), and even *gasp* realistic dialogue. The Iron Giant even has a good moral, something I can't seem to find in most other animated features. I can only hope to see more movies as worthy as this one."

I do not think it's too bad that we have too much 3D animation movies but most movies and I mean films in general are bland and they're just too different. This topic already looks like a lost art because such films are no longer made these days. If you made a live-action movie out of it then only Steven Spielberg would have the talent and experience to get close to this result. With a \"PG-13\"? I'm not 100% sure because we know that Spielberg can also press on the violence Tube, when I think of the scenes in which the robot goes rampage, I wonder if Spielberg would hold back nowadays.\n\nBrad Bird is just an artist and a genius. Not only do we have a movie with a realistic kids character that is not a bit annoying, but we have real family drama but not the embarrassing way of today's reality TV of all Kardashian scrap, proper social criticism but the message of the movie is not going to be that extreme beaten whit a Sledgehammer so that it is the movie enjoyment in the way. And I was fascinated as a little boy by the mother (Annie Hugher). As a child, I have seen very few animated films because I find them just too childish, uninteresting and too good. Besides, the constant musical numbers just annoyed me. Thankfully, this movie has none of this * and I love it *. (Of course not every movie needs sex, violence and cussing but not every movie has to be like a fairy tale)\n\nI have never had to cry at a movie, but this is one of the few movies where not much is missing to open my locks.\n\nHowever, my heart always is.\n\nThis is one of the smartest movies I've ever seen in my life. Unfortunately, he is a dying race, both in terms of style and genre, one more reason to keep the movie in his honor and show it to as many people as possible.\n\nI thank you for your criticism and your super interesting videos quieter more often videos about movies from the nostalgia department I'm curious what other people say about it and if maybe there is not one or the other movie of which I have not heard."

What matters is that this is smarter than all those put together. The way this shatters old perspectives is placed directly in the visual narrative -- the part where the kid watches the brainlessly stupid movie about the man-eating brain -- all intended to point out the superior intelligence of what we have here.\n\nSecondly, the use of the Giant's exaggerated height gives Bird the advantage of exaggerating the perspective of the 'camera'. He gets to play with focus and composition -- this is superbly detailed from every angle and in every trajectory...Anime without the losses in translation."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Iron Giant\" had to be the best of the first three WB animated movies. I liked the flawed but enjoyable \"Quest for Camelot\", (hadn't seen the WB animated \"King and I\", was that movie any good?) but \"Iron Giant\" is now the one to best.\n\nThe story involves a young boy named Hogarth Hughes (voiced by Eli Marienthal) who likes science-fiction, late night movies and MAD magazine, and later, befriends a 100-foot tall, metal munching machine, and needs keep him safe from those may report him. Meanwhile, Agent Kent Mansley (Christopher McDonald) is aware of a giant metal beast and believes it might be a threat (designed by who? The Chinese? The Russians? Martians? Who?)\n\nIt's not a silly little kids' movie. It's one the whole family will grow into liking. Also, I can't picture Disney making this movie, at least, not w/o (some or any of) the following: retro '50's stuff (ie. sock hops), Hogarth wanting to hide the giant and impress a girl he has a crush on, Hogarth having an obligatory comic relief in the form of a pet (his mom doesn't want one) and presence of heart. All current Disney movies seem to have all of the first three, but none of the last one.\n\nWhat angers me, though, is the fact this movie bombed at the box office. I hate it whenever an animated flick bombs just because it seems like the only reason being is it wasn't made by either Disney or DreamWorks. Maybe if only a LITTLE bit more advertising was put in...\n\nHowever, I contain boasting rights to this movie. In August of 1999, I could've been a sucker for hype and Happy Meals. I COULD'VE seen the snoozefest \"Blair Witch Project\". I COULD'VE paid for that Happy Meal disaster \"Disney's Inspector Gadget\". What did I pay for? WB's \"The Iron Giant\". And I know I got my money's worth. If you haven't seen it, my suggestion is to buy it.\n\nRating: 12 out of 10"

That pet peeve is the likeable child trying to hide the robot from adults. This absolutely gets on my nerves! If a child can handle being aware of the robot, then he shouldn't be afraid to share it with adults. I hate it when a film uses the ploy that only the child will understand and not the adults.\n\nJust an average 5 rated movie. Not bad, but not good either."

This movie costed enormous 70 mill. And was a huge disaster at the box office. But money aside, i found this movie surprisingly well made with very satisfyingly ending. The story here is kinda universal for all ages - young people will enjoy it same as grown ups. The ending was moving and pretty emotional. Also it was superbly paced - director Brad Bird did a splendid job with this animated movie.\n\nOverall, \"The Iron Giant\" is a classic not without a reason. It has great message and delivers it with grace. Excellent film for anyone to watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Iron Giant is an animated film directed by Brad Bird in 1999. It tells the story of a young boy discovering an out-of-this-world giant in the forest. We are led through their relationship and the journey to the giant's societal acceptance. It is a charming tale of choosing your own destiny, alongside others who are rooting for you.\n\nThe story takes the fable of a gentle giant and adds an American twist. The Cold War aspect is an interesting addition. The film is set during the 1950s, with propaganda being a large part of midwestern American culture at the time. It serves as an outline for the increased paranoia surrounding the giant. The film could have been done without, but I believe it adds another level of intrigue. Read into the propaganda related content as you will. I'm personally fine with it because in the end it sends the message of choosing to be good and promoting anti-violence and anti-governmental intervention. When I watched this for the first time as a child, the idea of nuclear war went over my head, but I still understood the general concepts of the film, which is arguably the most important. A child does not have to understand the idea of nuclear war in order to understand the movie's message and enjoy the film.\n\nThe voice acting in this film is brilliant and well cast. My favorite voice actor would be the governmental agent, Kent Mansley. He is voiced by Christopher McDonald, who has consistently played a villain incredibly well. His voice is strong and just condescending enough for Agent Mansley's character. As a kid, I remember being slightly afraid of him, just as Hogarth is in the beginning. As for the Iron Giant, his voice is done by Vin Diesel. It is hard to explain why it works so well, but he finds a way to create a gentle voice while still sounding like a robot. The gentle hums of the giant make him feel safe and kind, which is what he and Hogarth are trying to prove to the world.\n\nThe animation style in this film is so artistic and beautifully done. Even as a Warner Brothers film, it strays from Disney's mainstream and original animation style. It adds another level of depth to the characters and their environment. On a technical note, the color palette is not overstimulating, which makes it clear that this film isn't simply animated \"content\" with the only job of entertaining children. Which I deem as important because much of today's mainstream animated content are fluff pieces with little depth. This is a lovely contrast.\n\nThere are so many reasons to watch this film. For one it sends the message about choosing your own destiny, wanting to be good, and the distaste for violence as an immediate response. It is simply mesmerizing to look at, with the animation style as strong but not overpowering. It was refreshing to see Warner Brothers take a new look at their animation. I know many people are hesitant to watch animated films because they don't want to see a loud musical, or too childish of themes, but this film truly challenges that. This is one of the movies when I was little that made me fall in love with animation in the first place. The Iron Giant is a must watch."

It still holds up today and the animation looks incredibly fresh. The Iron Giant sees a large robot land on Earth in the 50's. A young boy soon makes friends with it, while a government agent investigates the sightings. The robot has forgotten who he is, but trouble arises when his built in defence mechanisms may be a danger to the small town. The Iron Giant is base on the book The Iron Man written by Ted Hughes. A book I remember from primary school. This adaptation has Americanized it, as well as making it more of a space themed Sci-Fi. The book had a battle with a space dragon, something I would have actually liked to see, even if it didn't work. The 50's setting is perfect for this kind of film. It's all about friendship, and being able to make choices no matter how we were raised. The giant is both sympathetic and cute, as well as being dangerous. It's the age old case of violence begets violence. I did find certain moments rushed in the film, as animation is usually short, but most of all I had trouble associating with Kent Mansley. He just goes too haywire towards the end. This is great stuff though, with strong animation, good vocal performances, exciting action sequences, and messages about friendship, peace, and sacrifice."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Iron Giant (1999) is a movie that I recently watched on HBOMAX with my daughter. The storyline follows a young boy on the coast of Maine who one day thinks he saw a shooting star; but upon exploring where the star landed he discovers he has seen much more...he has found a robot from outer space. He will do his best to make friends with the robot and teach him the ways of Earth. Meanwhile, the robot eats metal things to survive and the more he eats the more at risk he is of being caught. If someone discovers the robot its life, and the boy's life, may be at risk.\n\nThis movie is directed by Brad Bird (The Incredibles) and contains the voices of Vin Diesel (The Fast & Furious), Jennifer Aniston (FRIENDS), Cloris Leachman (Young Frankenstein), Christopher McDonald (Happy Gilmore), M. Emmet Walsh (Blade Runners) and John Mahoney (Moonstruck).\n\nThis picture has a lot of the cool science fiction elements that will be a big hit to fans of the 1950s era space movies. I loved how those elements were spun into the unique storyline. The robot was awesome and it is easy to root for the kid and robot. There's a swimming scene in this that's awesome and always makes me smile. The animation is very mediocre compared to other gems released during this era, but the storyline makes up for it. The ending is triumphant and grabs your heart.\n\nOverall, this is a unique and worthwhile addition to the family animated genre and an absolute must see. I would score this a 7.5/10 and strongly recommend it."

It was a beautiful film that reflects the Communist paranoia of 1950s America through a boy and a metallic alien in rural New England. This movie is a genuine treat. It is something that adults can relate to with the myriad of reference to 50s culture, and both children and adults will love its innocence.\n\nThe film is drawn in a classical animation style like early Disney films to give the audience a feel of the time in which it is set. Unlike recent Disney films (thankfully), The Iron Giant does not have any cutesy little \"friends\" that serve as comic relief or to create nausea for the viewer. Instead, the filmmaker respects the audience's intelligence (both children and adults) by giving us a simple story that does not rely on embellishment to make itself more viewer friendly. It doesn't need it.\n\nThe author started with a concept - what if a gun had a soul? - and created this brilliant animated feature in the same vain of Spielberg's E.T.-The Extra-Terrestrial. It stands as a testament to what animated films should be (it is possibly the best in over 50 years), but what's more, it stands as a testament to what FILMS should be.\n\nI can't stress this film's greatness. Just see it for yourself, and be a kid again."

The actors voicing the characters are all great (especially Harry Connick, Jr. as a Beatnik scrap metal dealer), the story is very touching, and the film incorporates just enough reminders of '50s Red-scare paranoia and sci-fi influences without letting them overwhelm the story.

        "review_detailed_main": "Back in the late 90s, when most theatrical animation was trying to emulate the success of the Disney renaissance, along came a smaller albeit unique feature from Warner Bros. called The Iron Giant. Despite receiving critical acclaim, it was a box office flop on its original release due to poor marketing. However, thanks to a growing cult following on VHS and DVD, and the film's director Brad Bird creating Pixar powerhouses like The Incredibles and Ratatouille, the film eventually went from an underrated gem to one of the greatest animated features ever made. After over 20 years in its existence, I think it's time to owe back its debt.\n\nSet in 1950s America during the Cold War, the film follows Hogarth Hughes, who discovers and befriends a giant intergalactic metal robot. In response to the U.S. military, Hogarth must fend them off from destroying the Giant. The movie's main plot is a mix of the common young child meets strange creature narrative and the old fear of beings beyond our worlds common in 1950s sci-fi films. What makes the otherwise familiar storyline fascinating though is how it develops the Giant as a legitimate character, from letting its monstrous size tell many scenes themselves and Hogarth mentoring it like a father teaching its son all the advantages in becoming good, as if a machine could actually have a soul. As for the sci-fi aesthetic, the film cleverly plays around with the themes of paranoia from nuclear war common back then with a supernatural twist, since what's beyond their world was too much for them to even comprehend. Of all the films to blend thrilling sci-fi, atomic fear and heartfelt tenderness together, this movie knocks it right out of the ballpark.\n\nAs this is a character driven story, almost every figure in the movie plays an important part in some shape or form. With Hogarth being a rebellious albeit responsible kid, he also has the misfortune of his single mother working overtime, which makes his role to the giant as a teacher all the more engaging. In fact, because the Giant is often curious about the new world of Earth, he learns more from the values of friendship and life through Hogarth and the beatnik artist Dean, making their bonds all the more sincere and heartwarming. Speaking of Dean, he's more of a hip outcast to society that makes his own artwork from scrap and junk, yet that all leads to him reluctantly becoming part of the Giant's presence. Then there's the antagonist Kent Mansley, who perfectly represents how the government wanted America to think in the 50s, as he believes anything outside the U.S. and Earth is a threat and must be destroyed for the \"good\" of humanity. Rarely have animated characters been this relatable and this human before, including a giant metal robot.\n\nEven for a movie that strayed away from the Disney formula in the 90s, the film is animated nearly as well as any product from the Mouse House. Brad Bird is known for his exaggerated and stylistic character designs, and this film is no exception, as every character sticks out based on their physique and personality. The character animation adds in smooth movements, realistic attributes common in human anatomy and bold gestures that sell the performances. However, the film's true highlight has to be the CG work done on the Giant itself, as the crew created it with a cel-shaded approach that helps it blend extraordinarily well with the hand-drawn characters. The lack of overly detailed lighting also helps, since it keeps the contrast of the Giant simple and easy to look at without coming off as distracting. Also, major applause must be given to the cinematography and shot composition, as every color and every single frame conveys what the scene is communicating emotionally, whether it'd be completely visual with no dialogue or an intense thrilling scene with quick cuts and frightening glares.\n\nNeedless to say, The Iron Giant stands the test of time thanks to its heartfelt story, themes of acceptance over fear, lovable characters and wonderful animation. If you're yet to check this film out for yourself, then this is a must watch for anyone, not just film and animation buffs. It's not common that a feature communicates the idea that supposedly dangerous weapons could actually have a soul to them, yet this film found a way to do so through humor, pathos and ideologies that are still common today. Remember, even things we might take for granted can have more substance than we give them credit for."

        "review_detailed_main": "Outstanding, colorful, emotional, moving and fantastic. Those are just a few of the words I can use to describe Brad Bird's Iron Giant Movie. This man clearly has a knack for making movies. Let's start off with the first thing::\n\nCASTING- The casting on this film is so great you can picture these voice actors doing a live-action interpretation of this film.\n\nANIMATION- A unique style of animation that gives realism and quality.\n\nHUMOR- Brad Bird is good at this. Kent Mansley is the type of villain you dislike, but love to make fun of, especially when he is on his craziest moments.\n\nAnd Lastly:\n\nCHARACTERS- The Iron Giant himself is a very emotional and well written character, Hogarth is a likeable protagonist and you feel for them both when they are in danger or apart.\n\nI remember seeing the Iron Giant on VHS. And loving it, now that VHS is long past, I've purchased it on Blu-Ray and love the signature edition of the film. If you haven't seen this movie, you're missing a great deal. Watch it, I guarantee you that you will have a good time."

        "review_detailed_main": "Some years before The Incredibles and Ratatouille, Brad Bird directed this animated film, which was apparently a box office bomb (despite great reviews) and has since went on to become a cult classic. Even if this isn't quite as good as those later films, it's close (and it's definitely different, being a little more low-key and not fully computer-animated, of course).\n\nThe story is very simple. It is essentially E. T but with a giant robot befriending a young boy being raised by a single mother instead of an alien. Naturally, the government don't like the idea of some kind of potential threat, and both movies ultimately portray the government and/or army as the bad guys.\n\nThe Iron Giant is just really charming. It's got a good heart, and even if the story is familiar, it's told well. The end is quite emotional, and the characters are fun throughout, and easy to care for or dislike. It works well as a kids movie that can also keep the interests of older viewers, making it among the best animated family films of the 1990s."

This is the best animated film to come out of an alternate studio since Secret of NIMH (not counting PIXAR's two efforts).\n\nThe animation reminds me of 101 Dalmatians, and is a nice departure from what we've been seeing in animation lately. The script is smart, funny and tugs at the heart.\n\nGo and see this movie or you won't see more like it. The fate of the WB feature animation unit will be decided on the results from this movie and at this point it doesn't look good, despite the nearly unanimous great reviews."

Which is a shame, because this is a unique, outstanding movie.\n\nUnlike most of the animated films made in the States, TIG relies on characterization rather than on insipid humor(not that there ISN'T humor in it because there is)to propel its story, which in itself is constructed on 50's paranoia,and the damaging effects of fear. I also enjoyed the music by Micheal Kamen,the voice acting(Vin Disel actually has been in a good movie) and the ending, which I will not reveal.\n\nWith a new DVD release, hopefully \"The Iron Giant\" will get some of the recognition it deserves."

        "review_detailed_main": "Imagine \"E.T.\" as a towering metal man, and you have some of the appeal of \"The Iron Giant,\" an enchanting animated feature about a boy who makes friends with a robot from outer space. The giant crash-lands on a 1957 night when America is peering up at the speck of Sputnik in the sky, and munches his way through a Maine village, eating TV antennas and cars, until he finds a power plant. That's where young Hogarth Hughes finds him.Hogarth is a 9-year-old who lives with his single mom (Jennifer Aniston) and dreams of having a pet. She says they make too much of a mess around the house, little dreaming what a 100-foot robot can get up to. One night Hogarth discovers their TV antenna is missing and follows the Iron Giant's trail to the power plant, where he saves the robot from electrocution after it chomps on some live wires. That makes the giant his friend forever, and now all Hogarth has to do is keep the robot a secret from his mom and the federal government.\n\n\"The Iron Giant\" is still another example of the freedom that filmmakers find in animation: This would have been a $100 million live-action special-effects movie, but it was made for a fraction of that cost because the metal man is drawn, not constructed. And here is a family movie with a message: a Cold War parable in which the Iron Giant learns from a little boy that he is not doomed to be a weapon because \"you are what you choose to be.\" The movie is set in the 1950s because that's the decade when science fiction seemed most preoccupied with nuclear holocaust and invaders from outer space. It includes a hilarious cartoon version of the alarming \"Duck and Cover\" educational film, in which kids were advised to seek shelter from H-bombs by hiding under their desks. And the villain is a Cold Warrior named Kent Mansley (voice by Christopher McDonald), a G-man who of course sees the Iron Giant as a subversive plot and wants to blast it to pieces.\n\nThat political parable is buried beneath a lot of surface charm; the film's appeal comes from its \"E.T.\"-type story about a boy trying to hide an alien from his mom. The Iron Giant is understandably too big to conceal in the closet, but there's a funny sequence where Hogarth brings the creature's hand into the house, and it scampers around like a disobedient dog.\n\nLike the new Japanese animated films, \"The Iron Giant\" is happy to be a \"real movie\" in everything but live action. There are no cute little animals and not a single musical number: It's a story, plain and simple. The director, Brad Bird, is a \"Simpsons\" veteran whose visual look here, much more complex than \"The Simpsons,\" resembles the \"clear line\" technique of Japan's Hayao Miyazaki (\"My Neighbor Totoro\"). It works as a lot of animation does, to make you forget from time to time that these are moving drawings, because the story and characters are so compelling.\n\nAs for the Iron Giant himself, he's surprisingly likable. He can't speak English at first, but is a quick study, and like E.T. combines great knowledge with the naivete of a stranger in a puzzling land. His voice is by Vin Diesel and sounds like it has been electronically lowered. He looks unsophisticated--something like a big Erector Set construction with a steam-shovel mouth--but as we get to know him he turns into a personality before our very eyes--a big lunk we feel kind of sorry for. By the big climax (which, also like \"E.T.,\" involves a threat from bureaucrats and technocrats), we're hoping Hogarth can help save his friend once again.\n\nIt must be tough to get a movie like this made. Disney has the traditional animation market locked up, but other studios seem willing to throw money at Disney musical look-alikes (like \"The King and I\") even though they might have a better chance moving in the opposite direction--toward real stories told straight. \"The Iron Giant,\" based on a book by the recently deceased British poet laureate Ted Hughes, is not just a cute romp but an involving story that has something to say."

I hadn't been moved by a movie so much in my life let alone a 'cartoon'. The next few weeks was me racing against the clock to get everyone I knew to see it before it's short theatre run was over.

This was a tremendous feature which was very emotionally driven towards the end, which is what made it so special to me, and hence shot my rating up to a 9. But even if the ending wasn't so emotional I was still planning on giving this movie a 8, as it was enthralling throughout. Whilst it may have been a tad too clich\u00e9, even for a children's film, it was not only brilliantly entertaining, but also laugh-out-loud hilarious! And despite the relatively staid and uninspiring animation (although I do understand the limitations which the animation team had to deal with so I won't scrutinize this aspect), Bird manages to convey a beautiful and delightful story about the heartwarming bond between two very different beings. That may sound very generic, but it is Bird's execution of such a plot that elevates it from a simple, boring one to one that is utterly riveting and compelling.\n\nAdditionally, it's funny how much Vin Diesel suited the role of The Iron Giant, his voice was bizarrely ideal for playing this robot!\n\nI do want to talk a little bit more about the ending, as it was perfect for a family picture. Sad enough to stir the hearts of adults yet happy enough to not leave children in mourning for days on end! Thoroughly impressive.\n\nOverall, this is a magnificent animated movie and one that I would definitely recommend for those of you looking for something to watch with your kids, or even just for yourself!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Lonely kid Hogarth Hughes (Marienthal) discovers a giant metal man which soon becomes the friend he as always wanted whilst a government agent seeks to destroy it.\n\nThe Iron Giant brings together a sentimental story of a young lad with no friends but a vivid imagination and when The Giant comes down and the two share their first meeting, humour and sentimental emotions are flying around to make a wonderful film that is as sharp as many Disney pictures and is the first full length animation for the then relatively unknown Brad Bird.\n\nBird would of course go on to win 2 Oscars (and possibly more) with so far The Incredibles and Ratatouille that had a subtle blend of humour and family magic, and this is where Bird began his magic in the animation industry.\n\nBased on Ted Hughes' book, The Iron Giant is scripted with an imaginative realism. It is designed around a lonely boy who unfortunately causes trouble with every pet he owns and his mother comes down hard on him when he tries to express his repressed feelings.\n\nHogarth is a cheeky character that generates plenty good comedy in this picture. His imaginative nature makes you wish you were young whilst his enthusiasm at tackling exciting new opportunities, such as jumping in a freezing lake and going on his own adventures brings that accurate youthful mind that is scripted so exquisitely you will be flashing back to your own childhood.\n\nLike all Disney pictures, this Bird film has a strong message to portray to the younger generations. Lion King was the circle of life; Monsters Inc was child security whilst Robin Hood looked at the rich and the poor. Iron Giant has perhaps one of the strongest natured meanings at looking at life and death since Bambi. When The Giant is targeted he is triggered with a defence mechanism whilst Hogarth preaches to him about violence. It is powerful stuff that is all relative to the development of the young mind as this script looks to develop itself by looking at how to use violence and the context in which it is appropriate and when it is not. It is quite strong stuff, even for perhaps an older audience. When the Giant encounters the deer and the aftermath is very shocking. This by all means portrays the hard aspects of real life, blended with a sharp intake of science fiction.\n\nThe means by which The Giant communicates and discovers the world's systems shows the contrasts with our world and the outer realms. The scope of technology the Giant brings is vastly different and we see a shocking look at other worldly technology versus the U.S Governments.\n\nThe picture has its drawbacks. The humour is by no means on par with Pixar being awkwardly crude and in bad context.\n\nBut significantly the rightful message is portrayed and it is a wonderfully made picture"

The Iron Giant is simply put, one of the most beautiful and simple stories ever told in an animated feature. I went to see it 5 times in my country, and each time i couldn't help the tears. Gee, this is such a very touching film. Now i know it's getting high on video rent, but you'll never experience it as in the theater. It really makes us think about not judging a book by it's cover. I just wish Warner comes up with another film like this one. Disney sucks !!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is about a young boy (between the ages of 8-10) who thinks his family is a loner. So... he goes off to do what he wants to do, and suddenly feels something strange. He goes off out of the house in disguise and finds a giant (which happens to be the iron giant) who eats up metal. He then talks to his students about it, his mom, and then sometimes he just wants to teach it some things and make it stay out of the house (to not let his parents know).\n\nThis movie is slow at first, but then in the middle, it's hilarious. It's really charming and a great reference to Superman. Despite all that action, language and angst, young children would enjoy it too. While the movie is endearing, beautiful enough for adults and is as entertaining and funny as it is to kids, this Sci-Fi adventure filled with angst, spies, film noir and detective themes is a joy to all ages!"

It was certainly a breath of fresh air from all the Disney-ish cartoons out there. The animation is of a classic style and goes together with the actors voices perfectly. The setting, which is in the cold war culture of the 50's, is also an added bonus to the story as the fear of the Giant gets out of hand. The bottom line is that it is very enjoyable and teaches a lesson about violence and intolerance in a way that isn't sappy. Enjoy"

        "review_detailed_main": "I, for one, have tired of the typical Disney formula movie. The movie that has the same rags-to-riches plot, the search for self, the romantic culmination, the comedic sidekicks, etc, etc. And Disney has watered down its moral message so much to prevent offending anyone that there is hardly a moral message at all. The Iron Giant is the movie you WISHED Disney would make.\n\nThe Iron Giant is set in the late 50's. The dual optimism and fear so prominent in that time period is reflected in the movie and used to great effect. Young Hogarth represents countless boys who have grown up wistfully dreaming of space fantasies. Mr. Mansley represents the fear of the Soviet Union and nuclear annihilation of that period.\n\nThe boy finds the Iron Giant and is at once scared and sympathetic. The movie goes on to show how little boys are actually more adept at looking past fear than adults.\n\nThe relationship shown between the boy and the Giant is one of the best demonstrations of friendship I have ever seen in the movies. This is a relationship you care about, far more so than in any of the Disney movies.\n\nAnd, unlike Disney, this movie takes moral stands unambiguously. The wildly careening and inappropriate grace is hysterically funny and very much believable for a young boy. And the thoughtful conversation between the boy and Giant about having a soul is filmmaking at its finest. The Giant's uncertain status-- Is it alive? Does it have a conscious? Does it have free will?-- makes one think more about the afterlife as a result.\n\nThe confrontation between the Giant and the military is the one part of the movie that is action-oriented. And, like the rest of the movie, it is well-done.\n\nUnlike the Disney movies, or most any others, this is a movie that you do not know how it will end. I thought this as the confrontation started-- and wondered, will I be disappointed? Not to fear-- wow, the ending is super! It packs an emotional wallop. In fact, this ending will have you and your friends talking for days.\n\nI've been frustrated all too often at Hollywood movies for such technical brilliance but lame plots-- here is a sterling exception. The plot is what makes this movie so memorable. And not only for what it says, but for what it doesn't. Questions such as Where did the Giant come from?, Does Hogarth have a father and, if so, where is he? are left unanswered-- and the movie is all-the-better for it.\n\nThe excellent story, emotional resonance, and wonderful moral messages make this a movie not to be missed (unfortunately, too many have since no Disney marketing campaign backed this film). Here's a movie truly for kids and adults."

I usually skip animation at the theatre, but I made an exception on this one and I am glad that I did. I would even go so far as to put this film in my Top 10 list for 1999.\n\nTHE IRON GIANT not only had a positive message, but was funny and heart-warming too. As a guy who is totally at odds with the unduly graphic, formulaic, impersonal and dumbed-down movies of this era, it was a unique experience for me to walk out of a movie feeling good about what I just saw. For example, although FIGHT CLUB (8.5/10) is easily one of the top five movies of the year, I must admit that I did not feel particularly good when I left the theatre that day. Shocked is the word that comes to mind, but \"good\" is not one of them.\n\nAfter thinking over the films I had seen so far this year, not unsurprisingly, almost none of them made me feel good. Oh, I may have been intellectually stimulated, but was I encased in a field of positive energy? No.\n\nIf you want a big, warm fuzzy, this film, THE IRON GIANT, is certainly the one to watch.\n\n8/10"

Is well adapted from a classic anti-Cold War children's book . After a giant robot falls from the sky and frightens a small town , only a young boy (Harry Connick Jr's voice) is willing to befriend the iron man (Vin Diesel's voice) . As the young boy befriends a giant robot from outer space that a paranoid government agent wants to destroy . With his new friend , he teaches the townspeople a lesson about being afraid of what is different . Some secrets are too huge to hide !. The story of a boy and a giant from another world who became a hero on this one !! Something humongous is among us !. It came from outer space!\n\nGreat animation and interesting tale propel this story above average the level of most of kiddie fare . This moral picture effectively dramatises the war between responsible , imaginative solutions on the one hand and gung-ho rule of force on the other , whithout losing sight of youngster friendly action-movie requeriments . Along the way , the movie pays tribute to Science-Fiction genre of the Fifties and Sixties .The picture is developed with sensibility and sense of wonder and being quite entertaining, apt for small kids , adolescents and adults . And accompaning a sensitive , evocative musical score by Michael Kamen. Based on the 1968 children's book by Ted Hughes , which was also used for a 1989 concept album by Pete Townshead . This splendid and attractive picture , became one of the first of any kind to gross over the box office all around the world. Jennifer Ashton and Harry Connick Jr provide the voices for the splendid protagonists , along with others such as James Gammon, Cloris Leachman, Christopher McDonald, M. Emmet Walsh, John Mahoney and special mention for Vin Diesel as The Iron Giant.\n\nThis riveting cartoon movie was compellingly directed by Brad Bird . He's an American director, screenwriter, animator, producer and occasional voice actor, known for both animated and live-action films. He has been referred to by some as the modern-day Walt Disney and even designed the character Sideshow Bob for The Simpsons. His influences include Chuck Jones, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd , Orson Welles and Pixar co-founder, John Lasseter. And he also made a non-animated film : the blockbuster Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol, stars Tom Cruise .Bird has got great successess and big boxoffice hits, such as : Incredibles 2 (2018), Tomorrowland (2015) , Ratatouille (2007) . And his movie Incredibles (2004) is ranked #40 on the Top 100 Grossing Movies of all Time. The Iron Giant (1999) rating : 7.5/10. Better than average. Well worth watching ."

It does have some appealing, an emotional plot and a good ending, but, for me, it stays at 8/10 because I feel I have seen this type of movie before. A kid that founds \"someone\" that is very unusual or big, no ones believes him. Then people discover that he does exist and are afraid can be harmful, so they decide to eliminate him. Then at the end, that creature confirms he is good and it's a happy ending. So it was very predictable for me, but it doesn't mean it was bad. Another thing is that it let me with some questions like, where does the robot come from? How does he understand so well English? But I think that the movie let that to the audience to think. I recommend this movie to a family with kids, you will enjoy it for sure!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The roaring success of Disney's The Lion King (no pun intended) in 1994 inspired something of an animation boom, during which various production studios attempted to cash in on the trend to varying degrees of success. Warner Bros. Feature Animation had a moderate hit with Space Jam, but underperformed with the likes of Cats Don't Dance and Quest for Camelot. They had one bona fide hit with The Iron Giant, a truly wonderful little feature adapted from Ted Hughes' 1968 novel The Iron Man. It didn't leave much of a dent at the box-office, but found a loyal audience on home video. In the 19 years since its release, The Iron Giant is fondly remembered as one of best animated features of the 1990s, and saw director Brad Bird poached by a little up-and-coming studio called Pixar.\n\nIn the fictional town of Rockwell, Maine in 1957, the residents are busy gazing up at the sky in fear of the Soviet Union's satellite Sputnik spying on them, and school children are shown Duck and Cover style educational films to prepare for a nuclear attack. In the surrounding forest, a huge object crashes down to Earth, alarming local fisherman Earl (M. Emmet Walsh). 9 year-old Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marienthal) spends his nights watching cheesy sci-fi movies and dreaming of owning his own pet. His mother Annie (Jennifer Aniston) thinks they cause too much mess, a point that seems to be proven when young Hogarth accidentally releases a squirrel into the local diner. With his mother working late one night, Hogarth wanders into the woods and comes across the object Earl insists he saw: a giant alien robot (voiced by Vin Diesel) that enjoys munching everything from train tracks to the local power station.\n\nThis kind of allegorical coming-of-age tale has been done before (think E.T. but with an adorable weapon of mass destruction), but rarely with such charm and genuine emotion. It's influence can be felt in everything from the recent Pete's Dragon remake and A Monster Calls, and it's no surprise that the film continues to attract new fans. The Iron Giant questions what would happen if a gun could feel. The titular giant occasionally turns aggressive in the face of possible danger, as the alien's true purpose becomes increasingly and unnervingly clear. But with no memory of his mission, it's down to Hogarth to teach metal hulk kindness, and the youngster does so in a way that only an innocent could. A moment in the woods sees the unlikely friends come across the corpse of a deer. At first, the giant cannot comprehend death as he can regenerate, but Hogarth manages to teach him about the finality of death. It's incredibly powerful, and it's message is even more relevant today than it was almost 20 years ago. We all have choices in life, and sometimes simple human kindness and empathy can be infinitely more powerful than brute force."

The Iron Giant is a great entertaining movie, however there are some deep emotions and thinks in it. It's more adventures than Finding Nemo, more funny than The Incredibles, deeper than The Lion King, the recall of the Cold War feeling is brilliant, and the final action-scene is...

The end is heartbreaking and the last scene is a fantastic way to end the movie.\n\nLaughs are made all the way through the movie and my personal favourite part was when Hogarth was trying to get the giants hand out of the bathroom, in doing so, creating so much noise that his mother and Kurt - the inspector - run upstairs and storm in on him on the toilet.\n\nThis movie is fantastic and no one should miss the chance to experience such a marvellous film.

        "review_title": "An entertaining and heartfelt cartoon version of \"E. T.\" and \"Star Kid. *** out of ****.",
        "review_detailed_main": "THE IRON GIANT (1999) ***\n\nStarring the voices of Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick Jr., Christopher McDonald, and Eli Marienthal Directed by Brad Bird. Running time: 87 minutes. Rated PG (for animated violence and mild language)\n\nBy Blake French:\n\n\"The Iron Giant\" is much like a cartoon version of \"E. T: The Extraterrestrial\" and \"Star Kid.\" It is an effective, empathetic journey into the life of its characters. Although the film is animated, it keeps a mature edge on its concepts. There are no outrageous characters, over the top musical numbers, or a bombarding number of shallow, unbelievable happenings. This is an animation in which children will enjoy for its message, but also adults because of its qualities and depth. If we were to replace the cartoons with real people, that would be possible here. That is how down to earth this movie is.\n\nThe story details the life of a lonely boy named Hogarth Hughes, who is about nine years of age. He lives a very dual and boring lifestyle with his mother, Annie. He has made a hobby of gathering animals from the wild to be his household pets. His mother is a very busy individual, working full time as a waitress for a small town coffee shop.\n\nThis is a fabulous, descriptive opening. We learn several elements about the characters, structure, as well as the movie's style. We learn that Hogarth's single mother is extremely busy and has little time with her son. We also see that due to the significant time this child spends alone, he has a great imagination. This is the internal problem, that Hogarth is somewhat lonesome spending all this time by himself. This film has well-developed characters, better than some more adult movies.\n\nOne day, while alone in the house watching television, something happens to Hogarth. His electrical power supply to his TV set goes bad. In a desperate attempt to fix the problem, he climbs on the roof of his house to discover half his antenna has been bitten off. What could have done this? The first clue is the massive footprints leading into the woods. Whatever made these prints destroyed everything in its path.\n\nThe thing that caused the destruction, technical difficulties, and placed colossal holes in the ground, is a massive iron giant from space who has recently crash landed on earth. Hogarth quickly greets the robot and makes friends with it. The story propels from there after we see the humanity and gentle attitude of the android whom we share empathy with and are able to understand and relate to. The first act is solid and clear cut, proving to us that this is not only a well-animated cartoon, but also a well structured one.\n\nThe film introduces the external problem when an insane detective places his nose where it doesn't belong and discovers the gigantic metal creature. Hogarth is forced to keep his robot secret so that it is not taken away. This detective's purpose in \"The Iron Giant\" serves as more than meets the eye. His motives are understandable and developed, although shows signs of existing as a plot device rather than a real character. Also, he is used to increase the line of dramatic tension as he grows closer and closer to finding the robot. This is a very sufficient and well-written character who contributes to a lot of positive material and many possibilities for the film.\n\nThe only problem I had with the film is how it never actually explained what the iron giant was. It is an amazing creature, able to heal itself, shoot out lasers, contribute in conversations, and yet we never know how it is able to do these things. Did it come from another plant seeking help for its dying race? Is it on a mission to gather important materials for its existence? Perhaps the android was built by a cruel human inventor on earth but was overtaken by the size of it ands thus allows it to escape into space and become lost--leaving the iron giant no choice but to return to his home where he discoursed along the way and crashed. The possibilities are endless. Too bad the filmmakers took such a shallow look at our title character, otherwise, this would have been one of the year's most entertaining family films.\n\nBrought to you by Warner Bros."

        "review_detailed_main": "A 2-D animation movie with a great script, characters and old-style animation.\n\nThe Iron Giant tells the story of the fall into Earth of an alien giant robot, and his relation with a naughty child who lives with his single mother in a small town in the States.\n\nThe movie is set in the 1950s, during the cold war period and the space race, when aliens and robot populated TV shows and comics, and the imagination of the population. The movie is able to reproduce the mood and style of the era, even the animation style, but with all the improvements that technology has brought to animation.\n\nThe characters are psychologically drawn with great talent, as it couldn't be otherwise by a Warner Bros's movie, and it is just them, their human qualities, what makes the viewer click with them and believe they are real. Moreover, the cartoons have a superb body movement, facial expression.\n\nThe script is engaging and very entertaining, very funny and lovable. At the same time, the film address serious social and political issues in a simple approachable way, without lecturing: You are who you decide to be, if you respond to violence is your option., it is in your hands to make your own destiny no matter what your past is, your heart is always a great power to connect with others, no matter how different they are. Great messages to pass on to children.\n\nEli Marienthal is terrific as the little hero Hogarth Hughes. Jennifer Aniston is extremely lovable as his mother Annie (perhaps Aniston's best performance ever...),.Harry Connick Jr is very likable as the quirky Dean McCoppin, Vin Diesel very sweet as the \"brute\" Iron Giant, and Christopher McDonald terrific as the annoying paranoid Govt Agent Kent Mansley. In fact all the voice actors are terrific, and the movie is never dull, but cheerful and full of life thanks to them.\n\nThe Iron Giant did not have success at the box office when first released, due to poor marketing and a lack of promotion, but it has proved to be one of the most charming, entertaining and lovable animation movies of all times, to be put together with Miyazaki's and other classics of animation because of the quality of its animation and story.\n\nA classic for both children and adults"

        "review_detailed_main": "I'll admit it, I am beyond biased when it comes to The Iron Giant. I first saw the film when I was four back in 1999 and I immediately fell in love with it. I wanted to be Hogarth, I wanted my own Iron Giant, and quite frankly I wanted to be a filmmaker. This movie was my first real introduction to Superman, it was my first introduction to the Cold War, and it showed me the kind of America that I wanted to live in.\n\nI know that's heavy and seems like a lot, but honestly The Iron Giant is one of the best, if not THE best, animated films of all time, as well as just straight-up science-fiction masterpieces of all time. Just recently the film was re-released into theaters for two days as the \"Signature Edition\" with two additional scenes that they fully animated for this re-release. I was so excited to go but seeing as how I got to school in Bozeman, MT I was afraid that we wouldn't get it at our theater and I would have to drive to find one, but nevertheless it was there for two nights, and I went both even taking my 11 year old sister to one of my viewings.\n\nThe Iron Giant teaches you the moral lessons you need to survive childhood and develop into who you are. \"You are what you choose to be\" is the main quote from the film and it certainly rings true. The Bible says, \"For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he...\" (Prov. 23:7), and this is exactly the message that this film points towards. It's funny, it's exciting, it's entertaining, it's compelling, and it's over-all original in the sense that the magic of this movie has never been re-created on the big screen, in my opinion.\n\nThe Iron Giant is my all-time favorite film, so I'm obviously biased, but beyond the emotional attachment I have to it from my childhood, as I continue to watch this film throughout my adult life, it always brings out the child in me, and I always tear up at the end (don't worry, I won't spoil it). This movie rocks, and I can't thank Brad Bird enough for bringing to life Ted Hughes' \"The Iron Man\" in the form of The Iron Giant."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is a tremendous shame that this film has reached such a small audience as in my humble opinion, its one of the finest animated pictures to come out of the US. Sure, it does not pack the epic scope of The Lion King, but it is a very touching (but not schmaltzy) work and is one of those films that can literally bring a smile to your face that will not leave for days.\n\nSet in the 1950's, it tells of a young American boy obsessed with science fiction comics and movies, who befriends a massive, alien robot that has crash landed in the countryside surrounding his home. The two form a bond as he gradually teaches the giant about his world and the story then focuses on his attempts to keep the giant hidden from a US government official and the military. Not easy when you're a 30 feet tall, clanking mechanical marvel with footprints the size of cars.\n\nAlong the way, there are plenty of sly touches. The feel of the 1950's is perfectly realised with milkshake shops, bad horror films and the sense of paranoia that came from being one of two super powers dominating the world. The animation too is beautifully done, with even the metallic eyes of the Giant displaying tremendous emotion behind them. The story at times is very sentimental, but it's also loaded with a knowing sense of wry humour and though this may be a film with a child audience squarely in mind, I defy even the toughest of souls not to feel a little choked up come the ending."

        "review_detailed_main": "Now first off, I must set the table before we can dig into the meat of this review. This movie was not made by the likes of Disney Animation or their then-fledgling affiliate and now property, Pixar. It was made by Warner Bros. Now, in the 90s, particularly the late nineties, there were a rush of animated movies not made by Disney or any real animation company that won't happen again. It was an interesting time for animation. Not a good one, perhaps; other than this film, the best of these so-called second-string animated movies (not counting TNBC, which is stop-motion) by common judgement is Anastasia, a movie that I professionally dislike and personally despise. But an interesting one.\n\nThis movie is a great example of why it never happened again. Here is one of the best movies of the year in a year that was filled with great movies, and yet it completely flopped at the box office due to legitimately horrible management by Warner Bros. Seriously; this movie was not relatively expensive (though it looks the part), and it has a very marketable premise. How do you screw that up? That's not rhetorical; I'm confounded. Yes, I'm aware Warner has a history in animation. But that's mostly in television; they should leave movies to the experts.\n\nWow that was long-winded. Thankfully, this movie is not; at only eighty-six minutes, it flies by. You often want it to stay longer; not because it does anything incorrect, but because you don't want it to leave you. This is the kind of film where, if I saw it at the cinema, I would stay during the credits and afterwards. I would stay until they forced me to get out; that's the sort of film it is.\n\nIf the animation is not as well-funded as Disney's, it does not show it. There are ambitious scenes in this film, scenes that seem to be the lovechild of 70s Disney, 80s Ghibli, and 00s Pixar. You can't honestly say that Tarzan looks like it has more money poured into it than this movie. The motion is especially eye-catching. Speed is one of the hardest things to get right, really right in animation. And yet when it is done right, there is nothing on planet Earth that looks prettier.\n\nMiyazaki is the best at this; the first time I watched a scene in the third act of Porco Rosso, one where Porco flies his plane for one last long sequence over the land and to the sea, to meet his final challenge, my life was forever changed. I'm not exaggerating; those were some of the most invocative, most profound minutes of my life. But Bird clearly takes cues from, and shares interests with, Mr. Miyazaki. It does not surprise me that the two of them are friends. And of course, thanks to him helping bring Miyazaki's works over to the West, I'm glad they are.\n\nThis is a movie that gets darker as it goes along, but it does it in a smart way, a sensible way. And a way that can still get a kid-friendly rating. When I first-watched this movie, the first thing I thought of was eighties Spielberg (though without some of the sappiness.) If this isn't already, (I don't know) it should be one of those films that is in everyone's house, along with Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Toy Story, Totoro, Finding Nemo, Kiki's Delivery Service, etc. Kids deserve to have this movie be a part of their childhood. If I have kids, I'm showing them this.\n\nAnd of course, it is a gift to us adults as well, whether or not we believe that we deserve it. After the first ten minutes, the transition from 2D to 3D, doesn't feel weird at all. Even more, it feels magical, like it were conjured out of some fantasy world that we only by chance get to see. The writing is stellar and shows a lot of that quick wit that would latter become a staple of his. You get a lot of great lines without the sense that they're trying too hard like you do in The Avengers.\n\nI wouldn't say the music is spectacular aside from a few pieces, but it does fit the tone of the film well. The same is true to some extent with the characters, who are my one grievance with the film. They feel too clich\u00e9 and used. The good acting, particularly from the stars, Connick and Aniston, helps, but overall, he doesn't play enough with the characters. That's the main reason this film isn't as good as The Incredibles and one of the reasons why it isn't as good as Ratatouille (which also could have used stronger characters (except Ego, who was brilliant) but it is not as big of a problem and the rest of the movie is ambient enough to cover for it). And it's the reason I would give this film a 4.5 out of 5.\n\nBut that's just me comparing Bird to the ridiculously high standards he has set for himself with his era-defining work. I will go as far as to say this is the best American animated film of the late nineteen-nineties not including the Toy Story movies. Better than Hercules or Mulan or Hunchback. It's a whimsical film, it's arguably the essential 'Boy and His X' film, and it is a film with something to say. If this was made after 9/11, it would be the essential post-9/11 movie. The military are the villains and its clear they are acting out of misery instead of 'For the Evulz.' But above all this, I say that I look forward to watching it again. And I believe that's one of the endorsements I can give to a film.\n\nAnd remember: sentient robots are not guns.\n\n(P.S. This movie takes place in Bird's birth year, 1957)"

What really bothers me is the fact that this flick bombed at the box office, WHY? Did the Giant suffered enough already? Any way this is also one of the last hand drawn animated movies to be made before their type ,when close to extinct in the twenty first century. For just think how many animated flicks were in theaters(video movies don't count) in last decade and a half, which weren't made with computers, I am sure that three to five is the maximum number for most of us, for by experience know only five! FIVE, in Fifteen years !\n\nNow I don't for any reason hate Nemo, Toy Story ,WALL-E, Ice Age and Schrek, no are some of my favorites and Lego was hilarious. What I am saying is that Iron Giant apart from its great story, images and moments \"You stay ,I go, No following\" ,man I still cry when I think of it, had also the \"luck \" to see its kind in its last days of glory, before Pixar and Dreamworks took over the industry. #MOLOPOLY!\n\nTo the film itself ,at the high of the space race a robot from space crash land in the USA and befriends a boy, which teach it, who to be like superman. The effects are great and even the setting look accurate for the fifties period, why it earn 23 million to a budget of 70? The answers are ,the Six Sense which opened the same week, with the Giant and blew audiences away and the themes were judged by many parents as too adult. For real I feel go to an adult in the twenty first century and see an animated film and not be laugh at for that, in the end a good flick, is a good flick, end of story, because that argument of 1999 is obvious stupid!\n\nIf you haven't show it to your kids yet, do it, JUST DO IT! Bonus if Micheal Bay had think of making the Tranformers ,more in line of this film the films would be so much better."

        "review_detailed_main": "Brad Bird's \"The Iron Giant\" is, in my opinion, a flawless and superb animated film that is well suited for the entire family. I saw it once in the theater and loved it from the start. A few years passed by before I saw it again and I loved it even before upon my second viewing. As I've gotten older, I've come to respect it even more for being a film of quality substance, excellent animation, humor, voice casting, and even great action sequences. It's a film that's not afraid to get violent from time to time, not even to show a tad bit of blood, but it doesn't go over its head to disturb the kiddies too much. That's why parents are recommended to view it with them.\n\nThe animation designs of the characters and the voice actors who made them come to life verbally was absolutely perfect. The voice of Hogarth, our main human character, fitted very well with the animated design of the character. The character of Dean was just as good at being humorous and was not under-developed. The character of Kent Mansley, our main antagonist, was very well designed and acted. His overly large and forward-jutting eyebrows as well as his slender head and relatively calm voice was perfect for an animated villain. But who really steals the show is the Iron Giant himself, a giant hundred-foot-tall extra-terrestrial invention made of metal but containing a vast array of emotions, feelings, and thoughts somewhere within his several-ton metal body.\n\nLike I stated earlier, this film is not afraid to show a little violence or hard action. In fact, there's a lot of it. And it does not become overly powerful to be frightening, except maybe to young kids. Another thing is that it's not afraid to use a minimal amount of vulgar language, which is another reason why parental discretion is advised. But we have gunshots, explosions, and plenty of destruction on screen. But with no carnage. As far as I know, there is no body count in the entire film, which is appropriate. It makes the film suited for everybody.\n\nAside from the action sequences, we have an extremely well-written storyline and plot. And it knows exactly which subplots of the film to emphasize and which ones to keep a minimal level, such as a small romantic subplot. It is shown enough to make the story compelling, but does not become too involved to distract us or slow the movie down. \"The Iron Giant\" almost seems a little bit too short for its brilliance, but nonetheless, it does play at a very reasonable running time.\n\nBottom line, this is one of the best animated films there is out there. I highly recommend it for its brilliant animation styles, lovable characters, somewhat original plot, and overall style. It works out very well."

See this movie if for no other reason than to watch animation without Elton John or Celiene Dion all over the soundtrack.

The animation is incredible, the story, while nothing too revolutionary, serves as a basis for a great message.\n\nThe movie is filled with some great moments that are cute, while not cloying. The action, such as it is, is handled well and does not glorify violence.\n\nPerhaps most refreshing is the lack of wisecracking animal sidekicks and musical numbers that Disney has made so popular.\n\nIf you're a parent, rent this one for your kids. If you have any amount of childlike wonder remaining in your being, watch this movie. It will not disappoint."

With the help of a beatnik scrapyard owner, he takes on a government agent filled with Cold War paranoia in order to save their iron friend. The Iron Giant is funny, thoughtful and has heart. The script respects the intelligence of young and old, and the under-90 minutes running time attests to the brisk pace and judicious lack of exposition. Our hero Hogarth has a child-like curiosity about his new friend, and a fierce loyalty, all the while keeping sentimentality in check. A quasi-religious theme is lightly threaded through, and an anti-war message is more more strongly foregrounded. But none of these elements detract from an engaging tale of a young boy who is bullied at school looking out for his new-found friend. A good example of what animation can achieve when the screenplay is considerate of its audience."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Iron Giant presents a well-written and visually appealing story that works better than most Disney movies. Set in 1957, it explores half-seriously, half tongue-in-cheek the stereotypes and the reality of \"G-men\" and the US military mindset, the cold war, and life at the start of the space age.\n\nThe story is told from the point of view of the boy, Hogarth, who is a believable and sympathetic character. A couple of anthropomorphic elements can be seen in the robot, but it's not hard to suspend disbelief since these elements are subtle and not the primary driver of character development. The robot character is somewhat enigmatic/alien, which only serves to make the story more intriguing rather than confusing.\n\nThe other characters are enjoyable, even though they are somewhat flat (to varying degrees). The humor is not as sophisticated as, say, The Simpsons, but it's never annoying, overly juvenile, nor over-the-top as it can be in most Disney movies.\n\nBy the conclusion, I found myself unexpectedly moved, thanks to the well-crafted sympathy-inviting character development. Despite the use of some standard plot devices, The Iron Giant is certainly a movie I plan to share with my future children, and one that I will enjoy right along with them. Highly recommended. Overall score: 9."

Set during the paranoia of the 50s, it shows how humanity creates humanity and how violence creates just more violence. It has a message for the 90s and for all time. I am glad to hear a movie be so bold as to tell us the truth -- guns kill, and none of us have to be guns. We can be people.\n\nThe animation in the film is beautiful with rich colors and believable characterization -- unlike the over-done wide-eyed stereotypes we keep getting in the assembly line Disney cartoons recently. This is a real family film -- both the kids and the adults can enjoy it. And to top it off, we have a robot who becomes a Christ figure. GO SEE IT!"

As a 31 year old, I still cried when watching the re-release. This is the only animated film that has made me react emotionally. Not even my favorite Disney film Beauty and the Beast made me cry. So for people who dismiss animated films as \"kids stuff\", you are wrong. In my opinion, this is the greatest animated film ever made, and I'm glad that as time has gone on, it status has grown. It under performed back in 1999, due to bad marketing and competing films of the time, but it's now regarded as one of the all-time greats\n\nSimpsons veteran Brad Bird has been one of my favorite directors for a long time, and this, along with Ratatouille is one of my favorites of his films. The film's score is fantastic too. The animation is amazing, the voice acting is brilliant. And I'm a sucker for a film set in the 50s.\n\nIf I have to pick one thing I didn't like, it was the reinstated dream sequence for the signature edition, where we scenes of his home world. I felt it demystified the origin of the giant, whereas the original kept it ambiguous. But that's a minor quibble. If you can make a cartoon film that makes me laugh, cry and get emotionally invested, you've done a fine job."

Here you simply never feel that way; the story and characters are put first, not some self-righteous posturing done 1,000 times before.

However, I have fond memories of my childhood, the days of Toy Story and Disney Classics. I say this to give context behind me stumbling upon The Iron Giant today on television. I partly remember really liking it as a child so I put it on in the background while I did some work, but within 5 minutes I was completely engrossed as this film is fantastic.\n\nThis film is about a giant metal robot that arrives on Earth in the 1950s for unknown reasons and a boy who finds him and befriends him. The two form a heart-warming bond as the child tries to protect his new friend from a paranoid government official. This is set against the backdrop of the cold war and the suspicion and fear that came with it. I wont spoil any more but this film is so emotional I'm not ashamed to admit I felt a few tears once or twice. The story is very simplistic yet it touches on a number of ongoing political issues, most importantly that just because we don't understand something, doesn't mean it's a threat.\n\nDespite gong into these themes, the film never feel like it's preaching or talking down to the audience, and fortunately it came before the era when everything had to be very PC so don't expect anything like this film to be showing any time soon.\n\nTo sum up my short review, this film is a must-see even for those who don't like animated films, I don't usually watch them but this is definitely an exception. This is a film to watch with your family on a wet weekend day when you're in the mood for being cosy. I think children will enjoy the aforementioned giant metal robot but the film goes so much deeper than that, making it possibly the best animated family film I've ever seen."

        "review_detailed_main": "More of a retrospective commentary than a review; what follows is completely spoiler-free in terms of plot points, but is intended as an admiring post-script annotation to the film's thematic legacy and resonance.\n\nThe Iron's Giant is simply the best animated feature ever made and one of the most subtly sophisticated conscience driven \"films\" in all of Cinema. In addition to the elegant old-school cell animation, wonderful adventure, and truthful humor -- auteur Brad Bird's tour-de-force quietly and magnificently emerges as much more than just another innocuous warm-hearted family friendly diversion.\n\nSet in cold-war paranoia & post nuclear Rockwellian/Capra-esque New England/Americana nostalgia, this all-time classic gem -- with sublime eloquence and earnest maturity -- beautifully dignifies powerfully principled pronouncements on prejudice, xenophobia, alienation, anti-authoritarianism, nonviolence, and moral identity; Of lonely boyhood reverie and single-working-mother/son repport; surrogate family in father figures, secret bonds & empathetic brotherhoods; tolerance, compassion, free will, devotion, sacrificial love, and the nature of consciousness and the concept of a spiritual soul. But far from heavy-handed frothy proselytizations, it wisely finesses those virtues subtextually into the nuances while rendering a completely involving fantasy story of a boy coming of age through a symbiotic relationship with an otherworldly friend that rivals Spielberg's \"E.T. The Extra Terrestrial\" in pure exhilarating enchantment! This movie is all lunch-boxes, no soap-boxes.\n\nPerhaps The Iron Giant's most profound platform however is the bitterest pill: running against the modern hedonistic zeitgeist of coddled indulgence and fickle fluidity to shrug, \"The Iron Giant\" gracefully drives its primary message that each sentient individual of seminal volition is autonomously responsible for the decisions that ultimately define their position as a cognizant being. Regardless of birth or influence, every conscious entity with the capability to express love or hate beyond self preservation, has the self-agented obligation in full context of their ethical effect upon the existing morale they help mold to mindfully choose what and who they are -- even at the rejection of core inclination. It's the total opposite to excusing one's self because of proclivity. In this life each Soul is sole, but the lone quest to find purpose through harmonization, because all are connected beyond the dirt we return to, and everything counts, every attitude ripples, and every action reveberates. No one who is able, can dismiss that ability by citing implement or impediment as the deciding factor to their path. It doesn't espouse the total embrace of what one wants most, but rather the total thoughtfulness to what wants most from one -- what is right and worthy of one's \"oneness\", and where one fits into carrying that through for the sake of togetherness.\n\nDisney will glorify the vapid virtue of \"being yourself\", while The Iron Giant will implore the existential ethic to find yourself by being beyond just yourself. The high-road will always be up-hill, but \"you are who you choose to be\".\n\nIn empathetic powers, anyone can resolve to become \"Super\" by submitting to a supreme ethos/pathos/logos which reciprocates the sacrifice of superficial selfishness with the significance of synthesis in shared sacredness.\n\nWho you choose to be is dependent on what you will choose to service."

The people are unrealistic but this can be tolerated because they are stylised, which is fine if you like that sort of thing. Some of the backgrounds ARE beautiful especially the sea and snow, it is also nice to see how the weather and seasons slowly change throughout the film.\n\nThe main problem (as I see it) is that some objects, especially the cars and quite noticeably the tractor looks 2 dimensional. This is the first time I have ever noticed this on ANY movie. I suppose it is because the quality of animation does not match the background.\n\nThe actual robot is computer animated but because he is put into a movie with low quality animation you simply don't notice it, instead the robot looks like he was drawn with great care by a skilled animator (with normal animation) and then placed in TV quality animation.\n\nBut I am afraid I am just being picky the quality of animation is unlike don Bluth or Disney but it is effective. After 10 or 20 minutes you forget about the animation and fall in love with the story.\n\nThis is one movie where the STORYLINE TOOK PLACE OVER THE EFFECTS AND ANIMATION. Which is a nice change especially since the horrible trash Disney produced last year with Tazan. This is what made it such a pleasure to watch.\n\nIt is a touching film in which I dare anyone to view and not feel compassion for the giant robot with a big heart. The animators did a noticeably good job at making a ridged iron face show warmth and love .\n\n(WARNING THE NEXT FEW LINE MAY CONTIAN MINOR SPIOLERS DEPENDING ON YOUR OWN POINT OF VIEW)\n\nThe part when he prodded the dead dear and when he thought the boy was dead was quite frankly a masterpiece of effort. It is this sort of atmosphere that so many modern animated films lack. The LAND BEFORE TIME showed this depth of sadness and it can be seen with this film as well. To really enjoy a happy ending you must first feel sadness and pain. This is how I feel anyway a sad part in a film is essential for getting it's audience to care about it's characters.\n\nI gave this movie 9 out of 10, because I really do think the quality of animation (not the style the quality) could have been improved.\n\nBut the best comment I can make on this movie is this- I asked my little 7 year old brother whether he liked the movie or not and he said `I WANT TO SEE IT AGAIN' . He had never said that about any movie he has seen. So I can think of no higher praise for such a brilliant movie."

They are one of the few genres left where writers, actors, and directors feel safe to tell a story in ways that honor both an audience's intelligence and desire for entertainment. I loved *Charlotte's Web,* I loved *Babe,* I loved *Fly Away Home* and now I'm happy to love *The Iron Giant,* which goes on my shelf to have on hand whenever my friends, both children and adult, come for a night at the movies at my home.\n\nAs we were leaving the theater, my friend said \"I wish it'd been made 20 years ago\" and I agree. At the suggestion that the family find a fallout shelter once the nuclear missile is aimed at the Giant, Dean sadly replies that \"It doesn't matter...no shelter can protect us.\" And Hogarth tells his friend \"We're all going to die.\" Using the old \"duck and cover\" cartoon is brilliant: what a contrast between that moment of boundless optimism, and the end, when reality hits! For that reason, and for the love that so evident here between all the major characters, I wish I'd grown up with this movie. In an ever more violent America, I wish there was just one other release this year with a line like \"You choose who you are. You can choose *not to be a gun.*\" One of my favorite films this year."

        "review_detailed_main": "Set in a small town in Maine during the height of the cold war, this film is based on Ted Hughes' children's book \"The Iron Man\" and brought to you by The Simpsons' Brad Bird. It tells the story of a giant, amnesiac robot who falls to Earth, and is eventually befriended by a local boy, Hogarth Hughes. Hogarth must hide the robot from a paranoid government agent who suspects it a Soviet weapon of war. The truth is that the robot is indeed essentially a giant gun, but hails from a distant planet and bears unbelievable firepower! Ultimately, it is the friendship with the boy that brings out the robot's compassion and humanity, and saves the town from annihilation.\n\nI liked this film so much that after I saw it, I emailed everyone on my many contact lists and practically begged them to put on their shoes and hit the theatre to support this amazing film. Why should I care? Because I am an ardent believer in supporting cinematic--or any other--efforts that one feels strongly about. And I do feel strongly about this film. The Iron Giant is one of the finest, well-written, non-formulaic, intelligent pieces of animated film I have seen in a long long time, and I watch a lot of cartoons. At the time, just a few weeks after the film opened, it came to my attention that it was not doing so well at the box office. My bulk email was a modest campaign to boost awareness of the film, because in Hollywood there is just one truth: the success of a movie is based on its gross. If a piece of s**t movie does well, more piece of s**t movies like it will get made. Conversely, if an intelligent, well-written movie does not make its financial mark, that kind of movie will fall out of favour with the fatcats who make the decisions back at the studio. I personally would hate to see the entire genre suffer because The Iron Giant is recognized by a wanting dollar return and lack of ubiquitous Happy Meal tie-in claptrap. The Iron Giant is an inspiring movie that can be appreciated by adults for its genuine characters and solid story (not to mention its welcome lack of ill-placed Disneyesque singalongs) and by children for its well-executed animation and springboard for the imagination. If you can still find The Iron Giant in theatres, go see it (again). If not, it's coming out on video shortly.\n\nAnd if you don't want to take my word for it, I can send you the barrage of reply emails I received, with subject lines like \"Thanks for the great recommendation...I loved Iron Giant.\""

I saw it last night and my head has been so busy with thinking about it that I just had to sit down and send a quick note to my friends to let you know how wonderful a movie it is. It has so much love and care put into every frame and it shows. The characters are nicely fleshed out, the voice performances are wonderful, the themes of the film are so seamlessly sewn into story that it never feels preachy and most importantly, it is 100% entertaining. I went into the movie with extremely high expectations having heard others rave about it. I felt sure that I would be let down some because of the hype. Not for a moment. I was pulled in from frame one and was taken into this little boy's world until the very end. It does not pander to kids and it does not try to be cleaver with a wink-of-the-eye towards adults. The message that this story, set in Maine in 1957, brings to America in 1999 cannot be ignored.\n\nYou do not need a child to accompany you to see this film but when I walked out of the theatre I was trying to think of nieces, nephews, neighbor kids, or anyone who could provide me an excuse to see it again. If you were already going to see \"The Iron Giant\" (or have already seen it) that is great. However, if reading this has put you one step closer to seeing a film that you were going to pass on then I am glad."

For that reason, maybe, it drew genuine emotion out of me, something that hasn't happened since I first saw Barry Lyndon (of all things) years ago.\n\nIt's sad that Disney has such a stranglehold on the genre. I was so grateful that there was not a single syrupy pop song in this movie that on the strength of that alone I might award it a \"10\" on IMDb. But fortunately, Iron Giant succeeds more for what it is than what it isn't."

What follows from that point is true friendship, lessons of war, anger, parenthood, and the bound between a boy a Giant Robot with incredible capabilities. This movie is great family entertainment and should be seen with your kids or parents. Basing this story in the 1950's was a great idea, since war was just itching to happen and people didn't really have a whole lot back then. A little boy and his Mother just getting by in a small town of Roswell, ME really shows that adventure and the love of life can be found anywhere you go. The seen with the deer dying and the explanation of guns killing people were right on target. Yes, guns don't kill people. People kill people, but with GUNS. The NRA may not like this movie, but the fact that it shows parents and kids alike that guns can cause violence and bad things to happen is perfect in this day in age. The movie isn't very long, but the message it gives is worth the time of seeing it. Rent this movie if you missed it in the theater."

Really good one the story was simple and awesome the characters were remarkably fits the story and pretty much I was with movie flow shouting 'Kent Mansley' sometimes hehehehe.

The fact that it is animated only adds to its magic. The animation is absolutely superb, strongly rivaling Disney's best. The screenplay is wonderful, all of the characters are incredibly three-dimensional (something which, alas, I have a difficult time saying about the most recent Disney films), and the voice-over acting is simply the best ever. The young boy who voiced the character of Hogarth Hughes is a true talent - his voice coupled with Hogarth's animator's drawing prowess gives the audience the best depiction of a young person ever. Hogarth is very honest and real-to-life, from his innocent romping and make-believe sessions to his deepest and most heartfelt emotions; at no point in the film does director Brad Bird patronize youth. Hogarth is unabashedly human and not a \"boy as he should be\" caricature. Not since Elliot in \"E.T.\" has a young character been so real.\n\nThe character of the Iron Giant is so well drawn - both visually and emotionally - that I often had to remind myself that he was not a living, breathing human being. In fact, the magic and mystery of this film is the fact that it took a character of cold metal and made it more human than the average person one sees walking down the street. The Giant is a wonderful symbol of modern man and the beautiful heart that is still within him, albeit buried deeply beneath layers of materialism and aggression. This movie is a great reminder of man's true nature - \"souls don't die\" - and the possibility that, with the help of the Hogarth Hughes within him, he will discover the Superman he truly is."

The robot's desire to be a hero like Superman really tugged at the old emotions on my part. The robot, even in his darker moment, was truly an innocent.\n\nI hope the low box office sales don't scare Warner Brothers off from trying something like this again.

Such a case is The Iron Giant. Many people are blaming its poor showing on Warner Bros lack of advertising, which is ridiculous. I dislike the idea that unless we're inundated with Happy Meal tie-ins and action figures, the film is under-advertised. There certainly was adequate advertising for this film; it simply wasn't in titanic Disney proportions.\n\nThe Iron Giant is, no exaggeration, one of the best animated films of the last ten years. As a childhood fable, as a view of fifties foreign paranoia, as a statement on violence, it works perfectly. There isn't a single flawed scene from beginning to end. And it proves conclusively that animation can work without cute animal sidekicks or overwrought musical numbers; just a great story, brilliantly timed comedy, and some truly touching moments.\n\nThe combination of cel animation and computer imagery is seamless, with each technique used to its best effect. The voice-acting is top-notch, with Christopher MacDonald particularly good as the paranoid government agent. Having not read the book myself, I can't vouch for the film's adherence to the original story, but I highly recommend it to any lover of animation.\n\nIncidentally, lest you think it's purely for children, I watched it with a group of men over thirty, and we all loved it. Let's hope this film gains the recognition on video it was denied in the theater. A solid 10."

The film is beautifully directed and the voicing seems to have a depth and character that I can never remember seeing in any Disney film. It is in many ways a re-telling of one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time, \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" and is just as powerful, intelligent and moving. It is with out a doubt one of the best animated and sci-fi films ever made. Klatu Viratu Niktu (I hope I spelled that right)."

In the Iron Giant there are some serious parts like when the Iron Giant saves the town (Rockwell, Maine) from a huge missle or when Hogarth saves the Iron Giant from being electricuted. I doesn't seem to be a real kiddy cartoon but at the same time it is funny. Hogarth Hughes is hilarious especially when he put a little something in Kent Mansley Coffee to give him have diarrhea. You need to see this movie, you will enjoy every second of it!"

I will just explain here that you really should take your kid to this movie, especially on a big screen. It's very powerful, and very well made. It's a beautiful tale for both girls and boys.\n\nIt also is very good for children to see certain realities displayed onscreen, regarding talking to strangers, even if they say they wear a badge. These days with the CPS stealing children from their homes like crazy it's good to have the child know not to get in strangers' cars no matter what they pretend to be and not feel that they have to speak to them without a parent present. A definite recommendation. I'm also happy this was a Warner Bros release because there's a nice exchange/moral lesson about Superman that would not be there if this had been filmed by another studio. Beautiful. I cried and I'm almost 30!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Without doubt one of the best films of the past ten years, animated or not, IRON GIANT is a fabulous love letter to 1950s science fiction b-movies and b-fiction. The central figure, the alien robot construct, is as grand and cool a physical design for a robot as ever put on film; but then this is perfectly balanced with the character of the robot, a being who is sentient and loyal, as he understands it.\n\nThe robot, befriended by a young boy who is himself a SF b-movie junkie during the reactionary '50s time period, engages the boy and the boy's beatnik confidant with his trust, allowing the film to briskly detail the Giant's advances, as he comes to understand his own nature, the possibility of becoming a deadly weapon and a \"monster\" from the boy's comic books, and his understanding of heroism and love for his friends. In a world which is dangerous for the robot, and he in turn a danger to it because he is built to destroy, rather than love, the Giant's story of coming to the realization of what and who he truly is has a poignancy that is simply amazing. It is a story of redemption as great as the classic monster icons that have inspired this movie, such as the deformed Quasimodo of Notre Dame's saving of the beautiful, wrongly-accused Esmeralda who will be executed unless he protects her, even if he must die for her, loving the unattainable beauty he loves but can never have, or Frankenstein's Monster destroying himself and his newly-created Bride of Frankenstein because they are, in the Monster's opinion, a vile affront to nature.\n\nThe Giant too realizes he must do what he has to, in order not to be a monster. It is one of the grand moments in cinema when the robot faces his fate, and becomes more than human in the process. An amazing film worth seeing many, many times."

Eli Marienthal was an excellent choice for the voice of Hogarth, also, and who knew that Vin Diesel could sound like a robot? I can't tell how many times I've watched this movie with my little brother now...it has to be on of the best animated movies ever created. It can get one very emotional also...::sigh:: I almost cried when the robot quoted Hogarth and went to stop the bomb.

After being saved by a 9 year old boy, a series of at first comic, then later more serious adventures begin.\n\nThere's some very funny jabs at the cold war mentality, and some terrific, unusual supporting characters, including a mom more interesting and complex than you find in most cartoons, and a local wanna-be beatnik artist who joins in to take the giant iron man's cause.\n\nI love the look they designed for the Iron Giant himself, there's something wonderfully retro and almost art deco about him, and they do a great job of bringing heart and emotion to this gigantic metal creature.\n\nBy the end I was shocked at how moved I found myself. A lovely, well told, fun fairy tale that is as much for adults as for kids."

Wonderful animation, likeable characters and GREAT writing set this gem apart from its rivals, and despite not being a giant box office draw I suspect its gonna be revered for many years to come by children and adults alike.

Kill a few hours, enjoy the evening.\n\nI was quite surprised at what I discovered.\n\nI never expected to encounter such a rich story with beautiful animation, three dimensional characters -- even the antagonist wasn't your run of the mill clich\u00e9. I especially loved the intelligent dialogue that provided sharp insight into Cold War and even modern day paranoia. And the climax...just not something no one but Brad Bird and his team would have the cajones to put into a kids film.\n\nMany have harped on the marketing and I am piling on, Warner Bros. screwed up royally.

        "review_detailed_main": "Like all great stories The Iron Giant works on a number of different levels. In the simplest sense, it's a first-rate adventure story for kids with a nice balance of action and humor. There's a \"moral\" to the story but very little actual moralizing and none of the groan-inducing variety. The artwork and the music use familiar elements without falling into clich\u00e9.\n\nBut there's more. The Iron Giant also works as a re-telling of myth, combining elements as old as storytelling itself. In Joseph Campbell's landmark book, The Hero With A Thousand Faces, he shows how certain themes are constantly recurring in mythology, religion, psychology and literature. Campbell's work leans heavily on the writings of Carl Jung, who believed that these ideas are part of our human heritage and understood on a deeper level (often without our awareness). While this may seem like a lot of baggage to be strapping onto 90 minutes of family entertainment, it works. Furthermore, poet Ted Hughes, the writer of the story on which the film is (loosely) based, knew his mythology as well.\n\nWhile a small book could be written on the themes running through The Iron Giant it's important to avoid the \"this = that\" sort of allegory found in Cliff Notes and high school English courses. The giant does not \"stand for\" this or that figure in religion or myth. There are elements of Osiris, the Egyptian figure whose body is scattered and re-assembled and Iron John, from the European folk tale collected by the Brothers Grimm and the subject of Robert Bly's generally misunderstood book. There are lots of interesting twists on the classic themes. The character of \"Dean\" functions partly in the Iron John role and partly as the Old Wise Man. This figure is often a wizard in folklore (think of Merlin or Gandalf) but the writers turned him into a twenty-something Beatnik sculptor. The list goes on and we haven't even mentioned Hogarth.\n\nIf this all seems a bit too much like a Required Reading list or a homework assignment ignore this and see the movie. If, however, this all sounds interesting, read Joseph Campbell and see the movie. Ten or twelve times."

For some reason, I passed. A few years later, another friend's 4-year-old son told me what a great video this was, but I still declined to watch it. And even later, when my own nephew (then 6) told me what a hilarious scene he'd just witnessed in \"The Iron Giant\" (the one in which young Hogarth drinks espresso and starts talking a mile a minute)...well, even then, I still ignored the advice. Anyway, all the above folk will be happy to hear that I finally DID watch this animated sci-fi film last night, and found it absolutely charming. Featuring wonderful animation, nice touches of warmth and humor, and wry commentary on '50s paranoia and A-bomb lunacy, the film really does have appeal to young and old. Lovers of sci-fi and/or action films should especially enjoy the film's latter scenes, in which the lovable Giant gets ticked off and morphs into an unstoppable killing machine. My hat is certainly off to everyone involved in the making of this most entertaining film. And this \"special edition\" DVD, filled with more extras than you can imagine, certainly does live up to the advertising. Hmmm...maybe I SHOULD take my nephew's advice and finally rent out his favorite movie, \"Toy Story 2\"..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Animation today seems to be focused on grabbing the attention of both children and adults. The fact is most kids going to see a movie are going to see it with their parents, so it makes sense. There are pop culture references, and jokes strewn about movies that fly over the kids heads, but keep the adults entertained while struggling through the movie. But as of late I've found that all the kids get out of the movie is funny looking characters doing funny looking things, and all of the dialogue is centered on the adults. The reason for this is the idea that kids don't get it. Some movie makers think that movies with adult themes will be too much for the child, and in turn stupify the movie. Once this is done they have to fill it up with silly references and jokes that the parents will like. The end result is a less than entertaining film. Then there are the movies that say \"screw it all\" and actually focus on making a good animated feature. The Secret of Nimb and The Black Cauldron, and now The Iron Giant are each excellent examples of this. The makers of these movies give the kids a chance to get what the movie is trying to say, and the kids do. The political undertones of the Iron Giant may not be something that the kids will relate to and say \"oh look, a cold war metaphore\" but they understand the story and plot, possibly better than those who see what this is all based on. Too add to everything, the animation in this film is fantastic. Great film all around."

The opening where Hogarth goes on the roof to check the antenna and then into the woods with the flashlight has much more suspense, as it appears to be night in the Signature Edition. The glowing power station and the Iron Giant getting shocked by the wires has much more pop in the Signature Edition. Hogarth coming up the stairs with the TV lighting the stairwell when he goes to check on the noise upstairs while watching TV is another good example.\n\nThis is a really exciting and touching movie which highlights the intolerance and prejudice of people. Humans are out to destroy what they don't understand, rather than reaching out. The animation is superb, especially, the showdown at the end of the movie. The film leaves us guessing what the robot actually is- is he an alien from outer space, or a military experiment? This is an intelligent kids movie which will have you thinking about it after it has finished. Children will identify with the appealing lead character, as he struggles to help his friend. there are some really funny sequences in the film too, like when Hogarth gives Kent chocolate laxatives when he starts asking too many questions, and when the robot hand comes detached and starts wondering around the place.\n\nOverall rating: 8 out of 10."

Each movie features young protagonists who are dreamers and outsiders of their societies and present refreshingly peaceful resolutions to their respective conflicts.\n\n\"The Iron Giant\" has a wonderful nostalgic, small-town atmosphere that is brought to life by the stunning animation that is on par with anything that Disney has produced recently. The attention to period detail, from the cheesy educational videos that Hogarth's class is forced to watch, to the way townspeople talk, is faithfully recreated and really goes a long way to drawing you into this engaging world. In some respects, the animation style of this film recalls the early, groundbreaking Fleischer brothers Superman cartoons of the 1940s with its depth of field, but without the German Expressionist influence.\n\nThe real strength of this film is the relationships between the characters -- something that is often overlooked in animated films for flashy visuals and epic musical numbers. \"The Iron Giant\" has the feel of a very intimate, character-driven film with the relationship between Hogarth and his robot friend as the emotional centre but with several other relationships (like the ones between Hogarth and his mother and between him and Dean) also featured prominently as well. This is no simple Saturday morning cartoon but a strong feature film that actually has something to say.\n\n\"The Iron Giant\" is one of those rare animated films that appeals to both children and adults, that doesn't contain one annoying musical number a la Disney, and that isn't one long advertisement for a toy. In fact, this film is an entertaining, even touching, story about tolerance and compassion. \"The Iron Giant\" refuses to talk down to its audience (the usual tactic of most animated films) or spoonfeed them any answers. It also deals with real issues like death and bigotry -- pretty heavy topics for a children's animated film.\n\neasily one of THE best animated films i've ever seen..."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm pretty stingy about giving out my 10's on this site, but this movie did get one of them. It's quite simply that good. Anyone who misses out on it because it looks like a kiddie cartoon is sadly mistaken, as it features better characters and a more heartfelt story than most any other hollywood movie. You'll care more about the Giant in the end than any cookie-cutter stereotype in that \"realistic\" movie you were thinking about seeing.\n\nThe parallels to E.T. in the storyline are undeniable, but this film has a philosophical twang to it that in my opinion gives it the edge. The joy of childhood, the realities of death, the possibility of afterlife, the numbing effects of paranoia-no other film deals with such difficult subjects, and is fun to boot! Watch it with your kids, or someone you care about. You'll like it, I think."

Excellent writing, wonderful animation -- a truly memorable, moving, film experience.

This is the most heart wrenching and exciting tale I have seen this year. When this movie is released on video I will be the first in line to buy it. It not only is a beautiful film to look at, but it teaches morals like no other animated film I have ever seen (and I am a HUGE animation fan).\n\nDo yourself a favor and buy this film when it becomes available. This film deserved a better treatment at the box office. I only hope that video sales will help to make a profit for this great film. If not, Warner Brothers and other studios might be afraid of losing money on other similar movies and that would be a shame."

        "review_detailed_main": "Can it be that the best film of 1999 is....a CARTOON? I would have to say yes. This is perhaps the best animated feature in the past 10 years (or maybe even further back than that.) What makes it so great? First of all, it is a visual marvel. The film contained some of the smoothest animation ever, with CG elements flawlessly incorporated into the traditional elements. Vibrant colors and wonderfully expressive characters make the movie much more than a cartoon - it is merely animated life. The story is a gem. The hypothetical question \"what if a gun had a soul?\" lies at the heart of the plot, and issues, of spirituality, redemption, and sacrifice make the plot much more substantive than anything Disney churns out to make a quick buck. There are parts where I actually teared up. Yes, I admit it, a strapping young man such as myself actually cries at films if they deserve it, and this one does. The fact that very few people actually saw this film is very upsetting to me. It is the perfect movie for parents to take their children to, because not only will their children be wildly entertained by the endearing, larger-than-life title character, but they as parents will also enjoy a rich movie experience - thanks to a script which pokes fun at Cold War hysteria and propaganda, among other things. This review might ramble, but let's wrap it up like this: This is a fabulous movie for the young and old. If you are a parent, PLEASE show this movie to your children. And if you don't have kids, watch it for yourself. You won't regret it."

Parents who take their children to see this masterpiece will get so much more out of it than the tykes will. I think people who remember the early stages of the cold war (which I don't, I wasn't around yet) will watch this film with a nostalgic eye, while those of us who remember the last stages of the Vietnam War will see analogies to the anti-war sentiment of the time. Their are many metaphors spread throughout the course of the film, giving everyone something relevant to the era of their upbringing. Do yourself a favor, and catch this one at a later showing, you'll want to avoid all of the kiddies who's parents are too rude to keep quiet...then take your favorite niece or nephew to a matinee (but be kind enough to make them view the film respectfully and quietly)."

There's references kids won't get, like the \"Duck and Cover\" cartoons, Sputnik and general Cold War paranoia, which I remember quite well.\n\nNice that there's actually some sympathetic adults in this, especially the sculptor/junk yard dealer where the Giant hangs out.\n\nBut I did miss Townsend's music, even if they bought him off with a producer credit.\n\n(originally written 8/22/1999)"

After a few infuriatingly condescending remarks to the locals and jotting a few scathing remarks into a tiny notebook, he gets into his car to drive off, presumably to find the \"Big Stuff\" he was only just so helpfully (?) explaining to the locals. ** It's at this point that he discovers exactly half the passenger side of his vehicle has been bitten off and he jumps 10 feet or so out the driver's door, producing a noise that sounded a lot like \"ohmyGOD!!!!\"\n\nBefore he can make a coherent further statement the rest of the car disappears, apparently meeting an identical fate (the Giant must have been a bit peckish at the time). ** The other was when the Giant imitates Hogarth's rather unimpressive \"Banzai!\" leap into the lake and, of course, causes a fair-sized tidal wave. ** I happened to notice Dean McCoppin, sitting on a bench behind the inevitable newspaper, was still sitting in, and holding onto, his bench while being tumbled round by the water and watching an intersting display of fish swim by. ** He finally lands in the middle of he road, looking rather like a drowned cat. A truck pulls up just then and a brief exchange ensues:\n\n\"Hey!\" Without turning his head Dean looks askance at the truck driver and says carefully: \"Yeah?\" The driver then says, somewhat unnecessarily, \"You're sitting in the middle of the road!\" Without moving even slightly Dean again answers identically, except with considerably more force: \"YEAH??\" At which point the driver mutters \"Allright...\" and drives off. ** The second time I saw this scene I cracked up laughing.

With the robot apparently having lost his memory from a bump on his head, he befriends young Hogarth....actually, Hogarth befriends him. As most reviews have stated, there are no stupid Disney-used traits at all in this film. NO dumb sidekicks, no stupid songs, and excellent characters, including the Giant himself. Hogarth, his mother, and the rest, all feel and act like they should from their respective backgrounds. So no one here is exceptionally heroic, or sarcastic. I have endless praise for this film. It is bold and grand in every aspect. It is my favorite film of all time, tied with the Matrix and South Park: Bigger, Longer, And Uncut. And on one last note, it would be a tragedy if this fine film is overlooked by other underdogs from this year such as the Sixth Sense and....well, so far, these are the only 2 movies this year that I have seen (with the possible exceptions of south park and the matrix) that deserve to be nominated this year."

        "review_detailed_main": "Having heard great things about The Iron Giant, I decided to get it myself and watch it. What I saw was a wonderful event of animation, with plenty of depth and imagination.\n\nAnimation has come a long way from the days of the old Looney Tunes and Disney cartoons, and now with The Iron Giant we have a seamless merging between traditional 2D animation and 3D animation, with the Giant being fully animated in 3D. The result was the most visually stunning animation I have seen in a while.\n\nThe Iron Giant had a great story to it (being based on the book by Ted Hughes), one that was meaningful and one that allowed interaction with the viewer to use their imagination (there are questions which are not answered, you really have to use your imagination). All the voice performances were exceptional, and really added to the characters in the film, instead of making them one-dimensional. The Giant in particular had a lot more emotion then you'd expect from a giant robot made from iron.\n\nThis is the best animated film I have seen since The Lion King, it had everything in it, from laughter to drama, from happiness to sadness (the ending brought tears to my eyes). This is an animated feature not only for kids, but for anyone of any age. It's a shame it wasn't given the exposure it deserved, it probably would have done a lot better at the box office. If you're a fan of animation, or you just want to see a great family film, you have to see this. I give it 10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Scrolling through the comments for \"The Iron Giant,\" I found so much praise for this simple, beautiful film that it seems unnecessary to add another glowing review. So why am I writing one anyway? Because it's the kind of special movie you feel compelled to rave about, no matter how many others have already done so.\n\nWhat Disney has done to animated film the past decade is evil. They've churned out increasingly soulless, formulaic movies that exist solely to bleed every last penny from parents. They take their children to the theater, pick up cheap tie-in toys at the fast food joint, trek to the toy store for more shoddy ancillary crap, and buy the video so their little drones can sledgehammer the pointless sludge that Disney has to gall to call entertainment into their skulls by watching it 72 times. (Not that it bugs me or anything.)\n\nThankfully, \"The Iron Giant\" is the complete opposite of all this. A quiet, touching film filled with delights both large and small, its heart is as big as its brain. It's got a gentle, thoughtful essence that most movies of any kind simply lack.\n\nI am late 20s with no kids, and rather cynical (if the Disney rant didn't clue you in). I watched this film with my wife, and we both melted. If you have kids, this is a must-see. Even if you don't, I still recommend it. It's clever, well-written, thought-provoking, and it will resonate with anyone who has a sense of humor and empathy. Give this film 90 minutes and it will give you reason to believe that there are still people who use animation to make something special, not just make a profit."

Set back in the 1950's, there a young boy named Hogarth(Voiced by Eli Marienthal) who lived with his single mother. His favorite playground is a junkyard. Then one day, he meets an alien robot known as The Iron Giant(Vin Diesel) who is stranded on Earth. He becomes friends with the metallic being and he has a ball. Especially when he gets in an old Cadillac and it's spun around like he's in a merry-go-round. Since he was his only friend, he had to protect the robot from paranoid government agents. When one of them thinks the Earth is under attack, it was up to Hogarth and his mother and boyfriend to stop the Military for making the biggest mistake of their lives. Well, the Iron Giant does his duty by stopping the missile from destroying the Earth. That's true heroism. I enjoyed this movie. Like E.T., only metallic! 5 stars!"

I went into this movie thinking I'd catch a quick nap and instead I was captivated by this incredible movie. Not only did my nephews love it, but so did I. It was a great plot with an excellent storyline/moral. Great animation too! It's not a fluke that this move has an 8.7 rating at IMDB, it should probably go higher. Compared to some of the latest offerings from Disney, this movie outshines most of them (It was head and shoulders above Disney's Tarzan and Dreamwork's Prince of Egypt). Take your kids to see this movie, better yet, buy it for them. This will be a timeless classic in children's animation."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Iron Giant is an animated film directed by Brad Bird. It is about a giant alien robot who landed on earth from outer space in the year 1957 and seems to have gotten amnesia. He meets and befriends a young boy named Hogarth, who shows the robot how to be a good person. While doing so, he must keep the robot safe from the public and especially from the U.S. government who is trying to track down what crashed on the planet.\n\nI watched this movie at my local theater this week because it was only two dollars a seat and because I was very curious about this one and I left the theater very satisfied with my experience. I couldn't have liked this movie more if I tried. The critics don't lie with this one, it's a well-written, well-polished animated family masterpiece. It is something that both kids and adults can watch and enjoy wholeheartedly.\n\nStaring with the animation, it uses a combination of both traditional animation and computer animation. Almost everything in the movie is traditionally animated and then we have the robot who is, at all times, computer animated. Surprisingly, the animators manage to blend in the robot with its surroundings perfectly. The animation doesn't feel out of place with either the 3D or traditional animation, which is a pretty amazing sight to see.\n\nThe overall feel to it felt out of the ordinary from what you would find in most modern animated movies outside of Disney and Pixar. I feel like a lot of other companies try too hard to make their animated movies part comedy nowadays. With this movie, there were some funny moments, but they didn't parade the movie entirely. Instead, they're replaced with emotionally swinging, powerful moments that give it a very mature feel. For a family movie, it is quite mature, it's one of those movies that's rated PG for a reason. It delves into some very sensitive topics that were and still are relevant to the movie's time period such as fear and prejudice as well as what could lie beyond our world. To further that it's a more mature film, it does have some adult humor and language.\n\nI liked all the characters in the movie. I liked the simple, quirky and lonely boy that was Hogarth. Kent was a menacing, unsettling villain who always kept his watchful eye on the main character as two examples. My favorite character of them all has to be the titular character. He's a simple, yet deep and complex character. I won't go too in-dept on him since it would go into spoiler territory, but we do find out about his complexity much later which changes the mood of the movie.\n\nGoing blindly into this movie was a decision that I do not regret. The Iron Giant is a must watch for anyone who loves animated, movies or just wants a good movie experience. I don't think I found a single flaw or con with this movie when I watched it, it was an experience that I won't forget.\n\n10/10"

By keeping the number of core characters to a minimum, the film-makers allow us to learn about the players and see their personalities unfold without resorting to cheap dialogue tricks. Despite being animated, the characters seem real (my oldest asked me if it was a true story - a previously unheard of question about an ANIMATED film).\n\nThere are few other animated films which captivate my children in this way.

        "review_title": "Really impressive and vastly superior to a lot of other animated films.",
        "review_detailed_main": "I liked The Iron Giant, I liked it a lot. The film, surely, has to be recognised as one of the last, great two dimensional animated films that the Americans made at the back end of an era. If we formally acknowledge that the new 'era' of animation is, or was, from 1999 onwards predominantly three dimensional from an American perspective, then this is the last great film of that time. Here is an animated film that does not rely on purely the visual, even if they are as impressive as they need to be and opts for story telling and emotional involvement more than anything else. Sprinkle on a little bit of Cold War paranoia and you have The Iron Giant, a period set character study of a human being and a creature not of this world.\n\nThe film is one of which it is difficult to not just sit there, and stare in both wonder but more importantly appreciation at what's being presented to you. While both colourful and atmospheric, I was most impressed with director Brad Bird's attention to character detail when it came to the animation. It's the little things; the way in which the Iron Giant himself moves around in the manner in which he does. The Iron Giant is big and hulking but its presence is juxtaposed with the very fragile and delicate relationship he has with a young boy, who is established to be pretty desperate for a friend or companion early on. The Giant's presence and traits are comparable to the only villainous character of the piece, an F.B.I. agent who's grossly smaller than The Giant but seems more threatening despite the height difference and jolts about in an urgent and jittery manner giving off an entirely different feeling to that of the large, lumbering but friendly robot.\n\nBird's work here reminded me of Nick Park's Wallace and Gromit series, a series which I feel has since partly been inspired by The Iron Giant. There is that knowing feeling behind the production; that setting in the past and that referencing to what the filmmaker enjoys or grew up enjoying, indeed The Iron Giant's tag-line is 'It came from outer space!', maybe a nod to Hollywood science fiction films of the 1950s and 60s that dealt with the fear of impending Communist-related invasions. The link is uncanny \u0096 a giant robot the most antagonistic character of the film, believed to be Russian, sent to 'the good ol' U.S.A.' in order to destroy the nation from within.\n\nThe hero of the title is a nine year old boy named Hogarth Hughes (Marienthal) and lives with his mother Annie (Aniston) and in a desperate attempt to prolong some sort of relationship with another being other than his mother, he brings home little animals not exactly fit for household domestication. The establishment introduces this fact and acts as a good introduction to post-modern artist, working in a time not ready for the post-modern, Dean McCoppin (Connick Jr.) who's a friend and ally for them later on. After some other initial events, a large robot voiced by Vin Diesel, who merely has to supply some grunts and other such noises that eventually turn into synthesised words, comes into contact with Hogarth and they strike up a friendship following a train-wreck.\n\nEnter F.B.I. agent Kent Mansley, played by Christopher McDonald in the sort of slimy role you'd associate with him, in all his paranoid glory. I think initially, we don't really mind if Mansley gets his prize. He makes some enquiries and asks about but he's just doing his job. We know about as much about it as he does and it hasn't really earned its place in our hearts but it's not until Bird brilliantly brings together both the Giant's friendship with the boy and Kent's gradual obsession with the capturing of the robot until we veer more into a thought process that demands we don't want to see him get his man.\n\nEchoing what Bird sets up at the beginning, The Giant acts as a fatherly figure for Hogarth; wearing a constant smile on his face and vastly becoming one of the friendliest non-human components to a relationship involving children we've seen on screen. From the Cold War era sci-fi films of the 1950s onwards to Spielberg's E.T. and Cameron's second Terminator film, the referencing and inspirations flow and flow. Additionally, the other feelings I got amidst all this harked way back to comedy of the silent era and the use of heartfelt music and shots of character's reactions while humorous exchanges were played out \u0096 it seems Bird's knowledge and love of cinema-past knows no end.\n\nDespite this phenomenon of a giant robot landing on Earth and a child taking a likening to it, the film looks at the identity of the robot more than it does anyone else. As a grey and hulking thing, is possesses neither the colour to place it into any particular category nor the necessary intelligence to place it within another. What reminded me of the second Terminator film apart from the obvious fatherly connotations was the scene in which the boy teaches it the difference between good and evil, and the poor kid uses all the facilities available to him, which peak at mere comic books, to give this creature some sort of identity and how he can be 'good' like Superman instead of 'bad' like the typical 'destroy the world' aliens \u0096 perhaps a reference to more recent blockbusters like Independence Day which rely on flashy visuals, hostile aliens and zero logic. The Iron Giant is the opposite of this and is vastly superior. Towards the end, there is one lump in the throat moment and I don't think the immediate ending does the film a disservice. The Iron Giant is truly a special animation for children and adults alike."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Iron Giant is an underrated animation film and is just plain excellent, more so than it ever has a right to be. On paper, it's practically an animated version of E.T, but the film works despite the non-original story. It is full of substance and style with an underlying political commentary that will appeal to the adults. The kids will love the gorgeous animation (very good for a 1999 film) and the story about an unlikely friendship. I haven't seen this in many, many years until recently, but it was always one of my childhood standouts.\n\nBrad Bird's earliest theatrical film is about a kid named Hogarth befriends a giant robot from another world, during the height of the Cold War and the launch of Sputnik. Hogarth tries to protect the giant-sized robot not only from his mother, but also from a bunch of bureaucrats believing the giant is actually a spy for the Soviet Union.\n\nThe voice acting is not that bad. The robot does not speak English at first, but when he does, it was voiced by Vin Diesel who made the robot seem even more lifelike. We also have some solid voice acting from the likes of Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick Jr., and Eli Marienthal.\n\nOverall, The Iron Giant is one of those rare gems that appeal to both adults and children. The story is executed well enough against the backdrop of political and historical issues and the film is also a visual spectacle with the animation way beyond its time. Who cannot resist a film among the veins of ET, especially one that is good as this. It's a beautiful, must-see film. I rate this film 9/10."

I hope Disney is taking notes - can't remember the last time I heard applause at the end of one of their movies.\n\nThis is a fantastic show for any child this summer and a must see for us baby-boomers.\n\nWhen I went to the preview last night with my wife and two boys (age 8 and 5) I hadn't seen much press and didn't know what to expect. The boys laughed along and got caught up in the suspense & emotion as did the whole audience. We loved the story and I got a kick out of some of the memories of the day (duck and cover...). There is a great moral overtone that is delivered in such a smooth and natural way it is not at all crammed down your throat."

The story is kept moving along without the now obligatory song and dance routines and goofy sidekicks perfected by the Mouse. Instead the animators rely on a carefully crafted script and characterization. The main morals of the movie are \"You are what you choose to be\" and an anti-violence message that seem particularly pertinant in this year of classroom horrors. As the director Brad Bird has said \"what if a gun had a soul and chose not to be a gun.\" Overall, a stirring and timely classic that will stay with viewers long after they have left the theatre. I dare say, worthy of Oscar recognition for best picture of the year. Not to be missed!"

I know I may say it often, Nevertheless The Iron Giant is probably the most underrated, ignored and forgotten about movies.\n\nThe animation, story, characters, soundtrack was so great. I almost cried. Jokes, but I surely did this movie did have an emotional vibrational effect on me.\n\nBesides its tiny appearance in Ready Player 1 I'm not sure if it's a good thing a sequel/remake/tv show has not been made. I say this because current movies/tv shows in the last 15 years have been mostly hash. Take away the MCU and there is nothing putting people in the seats.\n\nThe Iron Giant was a beautiful movie.\n\nWhat can be learned? If you have good things the Government will want it.\n\nVerdict: Purely Legendary."

Now, I love Disney movies, don't get me wrong, but this movie has a different quality to it. Instead of having song-and-dance numbers, or slap-stick animal characters, it's just a movie. It's like a normal live-action type movie, but everything is drawn instead. I love the medium of animation, because you can do so much with it. The special effects blended much better with the hand-drawn animation in this movie, then I've seen anywhere else. In many recent animated movies, it seems like the characters are drawn into a background where they don't belong, or even fit in. This movie has restored my faith in Warner Brothers Animation. The story was wonderful, the voice artistry wasn't over-done, and the animation was nearly flawless. This movie is definitely one that everyone can enjoy without feeling as if they're watching a \"kiddie\" movie. What are you waiting for? Go see it before it's gone!"

This movie touched me very deeply, and I can't remember any other movie that made me so angry and sad about the way humans (can) think.\n\n24 years old, it's a cartoon, and it's \"only\" a machine, but at the end when the worst of all things happened I cried like I have never cried during a movie. It has been years since the tears ran like that. I don't think I ever will forget that moment.\n\nI almost missed this movie, because I regarded it as a children's movie, and even though I always go to Disney's cartoon to see the fantastic pictures, this cartoon does not have that kind of drawings. So I was lucky, that so many other liked it, because when I saw that it was in top 100 on IMDb's Top 250 I said to my self: \"Well maybe this is worth watching\", and now you know that I think it was.\n\nBefore the terrible moment, there are laughs, excitement and all the other stuff that makes a good movie. I loved the scene with the hunters that shoots a poor deer, and then looks up, sees the Giant, and cries out: \"Oh no, it's the monster\". That's so ironic as can be. I think the movie does a good job; it can be enjoyed both by kids and adults. I have already mentioned why adults would like it, but when I just saw it, the rest of the audience consisted of children with there parent(s). I could here that the children liked it. I don't think they really understood what happened in the worst part, they didn't sound scared. And of course, as this IS also a movie for children, it has a happy ending, smoothing out on all the bad things we have just experienced. And that's good."

But what shines is the writing. Brad Bird and Tim McCanlies have produced what may possibly be the best screenplay ever written for an animated feature film. As good as a few of the Disney features have been, and as good as Fox's recent ANASTASIA was, this is better. Add a solid, effortlessly smooth ensemble of voice performances, and you have a story that viewers will remember and return to with pleasure.\n\nLook for THE IRON GIANT on awards ballots -- and not just for animated films or SF movies.

I saw the film the day that it came out, and I was so taken with it that I had to have a memento of some kind. But there was nothing. No books, no toys, no posters. Except for an advertising campaign that seems to have peaked two weeks ago, publicity has been almost zilch.\n\nAll of this is a shame, because this is the best animated film I have seen in years. Brad Bird has crafted a fully realized world from the fifties, and set it in the animation style familiar to those times. There are shades of Lady and the Tramp in the large lines and fluid movement that the human characters exhibit. More telling than any technical aspect, though(including the amazing computer-generated giant), is the script. This is a beautiful one. Simple enough for children, but aimed at adults, the movie had everyone in the sparsely populated movie theatre laughing and cheering.\n\nThis movie should be seen by everyone it can.
