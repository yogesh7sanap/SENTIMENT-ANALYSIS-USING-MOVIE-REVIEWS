With all the excitement around the release of this feature, the movie does not even come close to the hype generated by it. What contributes to this mess is that there is not a single stand out performance that could have carried the movie somewhere.\n\nIt starts off with the four friends discussing their plans after finishing their school played by four highly overacting teens. The movie then jumps 10 years later, where Rishab(Sumeet Vyas) proposes marriage to Kalindi Puri(Kareena Kapoor) who has no plans of marriage but yet reluctantly agrees. Then follows the 'Siyapa' around the big fat Punjabi wedding intertwining with the real life problems of the Veeres.\n\nThe movie has no real sense of direction with everything coming to an expected happy ending eventually. The characters seem mingled up and a couple of them could have been interchanged. The performances are average while Swara Bhaskar's(the most talented of them all) is a complete waste. 'Veere Di Wedding' is a struggle eventually giving up rather than defying the challenge."

One of them sleeps with a random guy called 'Bhandari', she doesnt even know his first name. Excellent performances by #swarabhaskar n #shikatalsania. Hope to see them more often. Kareena n Sonam r okay. The film also teaches parents an important lesson, let kids make their own mistakes. Women should definitely watch it, with or without their men. Rating 3.5/5."

Yes, it can be educating women and empowering them in the workplace. But it can also be acknowledging that they're also just human beings like anyone else. Oh, are you offended this movie shows women drinking, cursing, and talking about sex? Do you not think some women do this nowadays?\n\nHonestly, I felt this movie was pretty relatable if you're not a prude, not a \"all I do is work and have no fun\" kinda person, not a \"wow I can't watch this with my mom, dad, sister, brother, cousin, aunt, nephew, step-cousin\" kinda person.\n\nSo, basically, if you're an average person living in the 21st century, you'll be fine."

The film is not on women empowerment, doesn't deal with women heroes. Fair enough. This has been made abundantly clear by the cast and crew and that is fine. Not every movie needs to be a serious women-centric movie. Some can be fun. And Veere is not even fun, not even close. It's plain bad.\n\nKareena looks real detached from the role, Swara is fine in acting department, Shikha is the best among them all along with Summeet Vyas. But Sonam Kapoor! Why why why is she an actress? She is unbearable in her dialogue delivery. Plain horrible especially in the scene where she is berating the arranged marriage guy. Half baked acting combined with bad and underdeveloped script and an overdose of abuses to look cool doesn't equal a good movie.\n\nPS: Anyone else seeing the sudden influx of 10/10 reviews from 2nd and 3rd June? Most of these accounts were created just couple of days back and have reviewed only this movie. Smells fishy. Is this some sneaky move by production house? Wouldn't put it past them."

I can't say one good thing about the movie other than its women movie having fun time in life.

        "review_detailed_main": "In a modern world full of chaos, Shashanka Ghosh's four protagonists try to find harmony in their relationships, both familial and external. Highlighting their journey through deft realism and contrived drama is what she manages in her comedy drama Veere Di Wedding, after being on a four-year hiatus to mourn the failure of the 2014 debacle Khoobsurat. In a hackneyed story that has been sampled in countless art forms before, Kareena Kapoor plays Kalindi, a young, chic woman who is about to get married to her boyfriend (Sumeet Vyas) of 2-3 years JUST because he proposed to her with a diamond ring. Introspecting her decision through the days before her nuptials along with her equally chic three friends who are confused but more (sexually) frustrated than her, Kalindi fights her familial issues and inner doubts that are mostly triggered by the blanket controlling of her beau's family in everything that she does, including the wardrobe. Director Ghosh should be lauded for crafting an indomitable chick-flick in Bollywood despite the trite nature of the story and the unnecessary hyperbole. For instance, the controversial masturbation scene involving Bhaskar's character is the most unoriginal thing in the film, which makes me doubt both Ghosh's and the writers' (Nidhi Mehra and Mehul Suri) intentions behind making this. There are many more scenes that come across as exaggerated, which although are hilarious, could have been soaked with realism to make the film not look like an exercise in man-hating and namesake destruction of the patriarchy. (Wonder what's the deal here, after the recent Lipstick Under My Burkha (2017) by Alankrita Shrivastava that also depended on exaggeration and far-right feminism!?) Nonetheless, there are a lot of great things to appreciate here: from Kalindi's gay uncles to the incredible performances of Bhaskar, Sonam Kapoor, and Shikha Talsania to the portrayal of men (Vyas's and Vishwas Kini's (fantastic performance) characters) to the free dialogues that bring out the best in the film. It's a well-made film even if we disregard the conspicuous and therefore poor placement of ads in the film for HSBS, Uber, and Gulmohar Lane. Plus, if you notice, all the books (in the bookshelves) in the film look irritatingly unnatural. I'm a 100% sure that these books were borrowed in bulk from a nearby sale (those 300 rupees per KG book sale shops that have cropped up these days) and stashed in the shelves because never have I seen the books of Bill Bryson, Wilbur Smith, and Danielle Steel in a single room; it just cannot and should not happen. What an amateur work by whoever designed the production set. Enough with the digression; Veere Di Wedding is overall a good effort for a comedy chick-flick and surely paves the road for more such films. Regarding it as crass just because you don't get the point that Ghosh tries to make makes you a hypocrite. TN."

This is basically what happens when you take few good-looking women and tell them to \"act\" in a movie with an awful plot. If you value your time and money, please avoid this movie."

This movie is not the picture that many share in India but certainly a change the existing state of affairs. Not certainly the cast and direction are superb. Swara with her new look is fascinating, Sonam with her innocence and Kareena with her independent thought all are enough to win hearts. Many myths and notions are broken through this movie. This shows the way film industry is taking turns to experiment with portraying the rapid changes in society. Good one overall."

In past, Bollywood has given brilliant films on friendship -Dil Chahta Hai, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara or even Rock On but this would have been probably the weakest of all. I did not find any songs that was tuneful which was expected in movie like this.\n\nThe only silver lining was the performance by the four protagonist - Kareena Kapoor, Sonam Kapoor, Shikha Talsania and Swara Bhaskar, who was the best among them.\n\nOverall, it is a colossal disappointment. Avoid at any circumstances. Horrible 1/5"

And fortunately i didn't pay for my ticket so I'm thankful for that. 'cause it's just waste of time, brain. You could lose few brain cell after watching this crap. Acting- kareena kapoor, since she's in this industry for more than 10 years, she knows her way out. But this isn't her best performance, actually not even good. She need to spend more time with taimur so can paid media can let her in the news through him that because after watching this, I don't think that her career is going to step up. Sonam kapoor, there's no word to describe this penguin. Just born with silver spoon in her mouth doesn't mean you know how to act, you can not act Sonam kapoor. Ms bhaskar, she's good actress but after her contravarcial tweets about present political conditions, i think this will hit her. Now about that fourth girl, shikha, in wake up sid she was good, and this crap, she's decent. Screenplay- it's not that screenplay is bad, but it really really bad. I wanted to leave the theatre between interval, but my cousins didn't let me. Music is as usual, bhangda, wedding music. And it's going to played in weddings for next 2-3 months. In my opinion, watch old classics, or sleep for 2 hours in your bed, cause in theatre your gonna do the same anyway."

        "review_detailed_main": "Veere Di Wedding (Veere - Friends in English) is a female-led adult comedy-drama film directed by Shashanka Ghosh.\n\nThe film follows four happy-go-lucky childhood friends Kalindi (Kareena Kapoor), Avni (Sonam Kapoor), Sakshi (Swara Bhaskar), and Meera (Shikha Talsania); who are now grown-up and engaged in their own lives. Until one day, when Kalindi decides to get married to her long-term boyfriend Rishabh (Sumeet Vyas). Now, Avni, Sakshi, and Meera must reunite to participate in the celebrations of Kalindi's big marriage. Rest of the film follows the fun ride of ups and downs through which all these friends must go to find best in them.\n\nThe film, at its core, talks about the importance of having friends and families in life, and the little moments of joy and fights which they share with each other. The film also discusses the significance of appreciating good things while accepting the flaws and moving on. Besides, the film is also filled with swear words, slapstick moments, and some hilarious one-liners, and it hold back on nothing. The film is hilarious in a first half, and in the second half, it goes for some deeper character arcs. The aspect of friends and family dynamics had already been explored in some really good films, so nothing new to serve in this one, but characters are refreshing and alive, plus the flavor of adult comedy.\n\nVerdict : It's definitely not the best film but a good one time watch."

If Hollywood does it, they know how to pull it off. All of this doesn't fit in the desi culture no matter how modern we think we have become.\n\nA movie in bad taste. Hopefully the directors will understand that they are misreading the audience. This is not what they need in the name of women empowerment."

When Richa Chaddha abused in Gangs of Wasseypur, it looked natural, but none of the actresses' abuses in Veere di wedding looked natural. This movie looked like an attempt of female version of Zindagi na milegi dobara, but it failed there too. It was all about product placement - Air India, Bikaji, HSBC, Videocon etc. The supposedly best performer in this movie - Sumit Vyas was not given a proper length in this movie. All in all, a totally pathetic movie. Bollywood has nowadays totally lost it."

It blatantly steals the plot and even the characters from Hollywood's Sex and the city. But keeping that point aside, I thought the movie was refreshing. Bollywood rarely produces movies where women are the target audience so most of the time people are stuck watching lewd 'item numbers' and beautiful, helpless airhead women with no purpose other than being the love interest in a man's story where she is only expected to be sexy portrayed in the the movies. This movie gave female actors character and important roles. Also, India is a super conservative country and the fact that they at least brought out some of the least discussed issues out in the open is a big deal. Change does not happen overnight. Now that these issues have been brought under the lime light, other movies can begin to address them and finally step by step lead to equality."

Its also a wonder how the censor board has allowed such a film to be released as its certainly very harmful for impressionable minds who could emulate these performers justifiably. Anil Kapoor is associated in this and that for sure has tarnished his image in my mind as he was always known for Gandhi my Father like movies and not Gandi Like this one. If modernity means obscenity & if freedom means pervert actions than I rather stay well away from being modern or free.. This movie should be banned as it depicts careless candour. IMDB should allow negative rating till -10 from now on.."

It is a 2 hr disaster of a movie with actors trying to portray roles totally not meant for them. The only saving grace were Vivek Mushran who portrays a \"Modern Family\" type Gay older couple, Shika Talsania as one of the Veere, who is natural with her comic timing and Sumeet Vyas whom we all love from the TVF web series brings in his charm. There is nothing novel in this tale of womance. Just a waste of good actors in a total vapid story and an annoying first half. Even the cliches don't work well like the grand Punjabi wedding or hook ups or even a bachelorette/honeymoon party in Thailand. Bollywood makes better bromance movies. Disaster of a movie. By the way this movie sponsored by Bikaji chats, Uber, HSBC and Amanpuri resort Phuket.."

This film fails to deliver as a traditional chick flick or even as a comedy. People unaccustomed to American cinema may find that the film works in terms of its \"shock value\" including curse words and \"liberalised values\" such as smoking / drinking. Firstly smoking and drinking excessively are no longer cool the world over. I wonder why Hindi films in particular are fixated on smoking for example. Not only is smoking known to be extremely harmful but fewer western people are actually smoking these days (especially in England it's seen as pretty uncool and antisocial to smoke) - people saying the characters have \"western values\" are certainly ill-informed as these are not western values at all and certainly not values you'd want to ape. Secondly the film simply isn't entertaining. Agreed that some of the clothes look good and maybe the rich lifestyle paints a picture of aspiration for some Indians, but that isn't enough to redeem a film. More work could've been done to establish the chemistry between the leads which I think wasn't convincing enough. It was loud, brash and for something wanting to be different, extremely stereotypical! I expected to have fun and was unfortunately let down."

Be Rooted: However much one may be sophisticated, donning the luxuries and living in the upper spectrum of the society, one must always be desi in thy taste. Like digging into our desi brands Amul Ice-Creams, Bikaji Bhujias, and uttering only sadak-chaap gaalis. 2. Live Life king-Size: Splurge in the designers outfits, make impromptu international-travel plans, take bikaji along, dip into the infinity-pool, slosh away your worries with friends.For everything else there is HSBC credit card. Apply for it. 3. Don't Worry, Be Happy: Every character in the movie seemed troubled except the one and only one Carefree- Underdog-Chichora, 'Bhandari', who has all the fun throughout. Give-a-Damn, Care-a-damn! 4. Keep making mistakes: Even if it causes lifetime addiction. 5. Vocabulary Improvisation: Did you know words like 'Veeres', 'Wast Delhi', ' Charmsukkh' and many such frivolous ones before?.. Must learn coz knowledge is power!"

By the way, if Kareena is Kalu, then I am the darkest shade of Black. I am a great fan of Swara Bhaskar; she effortlessly faked the often faked gasps, moans and the ecstasy.\n\nHaving paid for the movie tickets with my HSBC credit card, I immediately felt connected watching Sonam Kapoor and her girlies using the same card; on multiple occasions. Watching them board Air India reminded me of my bland maiden flight to Mumbai in a lusterless Air India vimaan. Their presence glamorized the otherwise unstimulating government airline. Apart from Kareena, Swara, Sonam, Shikha and Sumit Vyasa the movie also featured Uber, Bikaji, Amul, Videocon, Air India, HSBC and a few other brands that the poor me couldn't identify.\n\nVeere Di Wedding is definitely not a chick flick. It's about woman empowerment; her pleasure lies in her own hands. Glorified."

But depicting Sonam kapoor in one night stand under the influence where the guy clearly knew she was under the influence of alcohol, is stupidity or rather i called a sex assault not bravery of Sonam kapoor to go out of norm. Glamorizing such type ideas where in asian society the education and sex education is not common is very misleading for adults and teenagers."

Than again since it was being produced by Sonam Kapoor's DADDY guess her cost was not included and she for the same reason is having more screen time than the others. Than again, there is nothing special about this movie. Its highly impressed by Sex and the City. Kareena certainly not at all looking from the same age group as being played.

To be honest the film was just boring, I feel like they were trying to make a modern film like zindagi na milegi dobara, well they needed a better storyline and director. I don't think any of the cast were at fault really, but the group of 4 girls didn't have much chemistry as a friendship group.

The chemistry between the 4 is beautiful. The supporting cast included Sumeet Vyas, Neena Gupta, Vivek Mushran, Manoj Pahwa, they were all the toppings of the cake, which well suited the whole cast assemble.\n\nPLOT 4 school friends who were now at different stages of life, each one facing their own sets of problems and yet friendship glued them together. Veere Di Wedding is lighthearted, yet opens up eyes of the mediocre mindset. There were a lot of shocking dialogues and scenes, which were probably first timers in Bollywood. (definitely not advised for kids hence R21).\n\nSOUNDTRACK We all have been loving Badshah's Tareefan since a while now, however the title track Veere surely reminds everyone of their Veeres. I personally enjoyed the foot tapping Bhangra Ta Sajda as well."

Identified with the city liberated girls, discarding the rules imposed by society via double standards for men and women - men seeking liberated women while wanting the coy bride to please the family. Successfully showed we are not perfect, it's okay to make mistakes and we learn from it. And it's okay for women in today's world who are taking in so many responsibilities and roles to seek their sexual pleasures and happiness in life without any fear or ridicule. Put the double standards of both men and women in it's place. The movie and characters are based on 'Sex and the City'. What I disliked however was the use of extensive foul language. That I guess is Hindi cinema overdoing things and creating steoretypes. Using foul language does not mean you are liberated, intelligent, independent person - be it man or woman. All vulgar language displays is lack of elegance, classiness. It shows only craziness and a cheap upbringing. So I wish Bollywood stops portraying this message that only hurts liberated women and distracts you from the real theme and meaning of the movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Veere di Wedding' is your typical friendship themed movie complete with raunchy dialogues, bold situations, flawed characters, and underlying heart. The only difference is that it's about 4 women. And that's a big difference and a welcome change. Eyebrows were raised when the trailer was released. People (read: men) scoffed at the idea of women behaving in such an atypical manner. I just hoped for a good movie to silence the critics and boy, I should say girl, did they hit the nail on the head.\n\nThank God it wasn't censored! That was the first thought that went through my mind when the veeres started swearing like it was going out of fashion. Nothing is off limits in this movie; the makers aim to shock and scandalize...but you know what, nothing that happens in the movie is actually outrageous or obscene. It's just that we've never seen it shown so openly on screen before. There's a particular scene in the 2nd half that literally had the theatre gasping because we couldn't believe the audacity of the filmmakers. A nervous and appreciative chuckle followed the gasp when we realized that this is for real. I hate to state the obvious but women, like men, swear, drink, talk about sex and almost everything else under the sun. So why the hypocrisy? I'm not going to pull at that thread but I will give major kudos to Rhea Kapoor and Ekta Kapoor for backing this project and not shying away from, like I said, the obvious.\n\nKalindi (Kareena Kapoor Khan), Avni (Sonam K Ahuja), Sakshi (Swara Bhasker), and Meera (Shikha Talsania) are childhood friends who despite the years and distance have remained close. When Kalindi cringingly accepts her boyfriend's proposal the friends come back together to celebrate their veer. Everyone's dealing with something or another but that doesn't stop them from sporting designer outfits, driving around in a Bentley, and going off to Phuket on a whim. I mean it's a Kapoor led film, did you expect anything less? If you don't cry and have a mental breakdown in heels with your hair done up are you really a Kapoor? I think not. Frankly, the characters' problems are superficial, the extravagance is well, extravagant, and the blatant product placement is absurd. But that's the fun of it all. Director Shashanka Ghosh of Khoobsurat fame knows how to keep it light and entertaining. His cast is having a rollicking time and the audience along with it.\n\nKareena is a born star and she knows how to use it. She headlines the cast with tremendous oomph and might I add looks incredible doing it. The new Ahuja and former Kapoor does what she always does. Sonam's outfits are on point and her acting, while not worthy of her former surname, works fine here. Swara has the challenging role in the bunch which she enacts it with confidence and Shikha delivers her crackling lines with humor keeping the audience in splits. A genuine camaraderie between the veeres helps balance the film nicely.\n\nThere is a clear target audience for this movie. Where else will you get to know what charam sukh is? Everything is mounted glamorously giving the actors a chance to be stars instead of characters. And the music is some of the best I've heard in recent times. This veere's wedding is a blast!

That's something special for a big budget Bollywood movie.\n\nSo, are the men in this movie more feminine and the women more masculine, read: promiscuous? No, because life and sharing life has nothing to do with gender sentiments. It is about equality in sharing everything. And let's be honest; on a physical and mental level, a woman will always outdo a man, on, for instance; exploring her sensuel side. That has nothing to do with ill behavior or copying a man. It's biology. It's healthy. It is human. It is what you will get in a growing economy. And that is what all the men (and some women!!??),who slammed this movie on IMDB are afraid of."

        "review_title": "Of filter-free, fun and fabulous Veeres",
        "review_detailed_main": "Veere Di Wedding was worth every micro second of the long wait if we go by famous words uttered by the ever-articulate Swara Bhasker: \"It's taken 105 years for mainstream Bollywood to make a film about four girlfriends and none of them are falling in love with the same guy.\" Truth.\n\nWe haven't had a high-spirited female version of Dil Chahta Hai (2001), for lack of a better comparision, with mainstream actors. VDW gets the core of breezy group friendships right and doesn't delve much into life stories as its depth lies elsewhere. The awesome foursome glide in tandem taking us on a rib-tickling, racy and memorable adventure instead.\n\nFreely living in their space without filter, we have seen these girls in real life but they have been missing from Hindi cinema. A young mother needs to party hard; a bride demands a drink to ease her stress; a single girl leads a kiss because she is horny; a woman screams expletives into the phone. No judgment. No justification, aid or loophole either.\n\nWow. Like, really. Wow.\n\nWhen I go to watch Biwi No. 1, I don't expect Masoom level of nuance. Similarly when I go to watch Veere Di Wedding, I don't expect Lipstick Under My Burkha. Having said that VDW will connect with more women purely because within that genre they have socked convention out the park. They have basically managed to pull off a Rajkumar Hirani I would say. :)\n\nNot every venture featuring lead women actors needs to bear the burden of being chick flick or feminist. There is a commercial place between frivolous and serious which can still convey an important message by just being. This is that.\n\nDirector Shashanka Ghosh and writers Nidhi Mehra and Mehul Suri do an outstanding job with the storytelling, script and dialogue and this is where true gold is. An ordinary story turns extraordinary with mundane scenes that knock Hindi cinematic boundaries subtly and beautifully, boldly touching upon and normalising aspects of female sexuality, motherhood, marriage, and single life.\n\nCommitment issues in a woman, check. She races into a toilet at the mere thought of marriage before saying yes, the audience I am watching it with goes into double splits. Perceptions of motherhood, check, check. She vomits a mad, drunk night into the toilet pot as her two-year-old cutely imitates \"uwooah\". More amused women in the cinema. Masturbation, check, check, check. She is gadget-happy, nothing comes between her and a good time. Giggles and laughs. A man who has different views of wife vs. girlfriend, check, check, check, check. She calls him out pronto, and finds a man who doesn't. The Nirmal and Bhandari characters elicit the right responses from women.\n\nThe lives of Kalindi (Kareena Kapoor), Avni (Sonam Kapoor), Sakshi (Swara Bhasker) and Meera (Shikha Talsania) unfold in an OTT Delhi wedding setting which works like a charm. Especially with the banter and colourful vocabulary. The girls meet after 10 years for Kalindi's wedding. With dysfunctional families in the mix, life's complicated while they are caught amid the flamboyant and hilarious celebration prep. All that jazz does happen for real, complete with a couple mounted on a fake moon and a wedding scene with varying degrees of flashiness. So it gets both the Delhi wedding culture and sarcasm down pat.\n\nKalindi fears marriage even as she accepts boyfriend Rishabh's (Sumeet Vyas) marriage proposal. Their relationship is captured well. Everything is right and yet external pressures weigh on them. Avni struggles with the lows of single life, a pushy mother completing the picture. A suitor tanks and a fling soars who she judges rather unfairly. Only she gets over it, unlike her male counterpart Nirmal. Sakshi is battling a separation from her husband, trying to steer her mind away from the final decision by having a good time partying. Happily married to American John (Edward Sonnenblick), Meera is having body image issues after the baby.\n\n\n\nThe choreography is excellent, mapping the comical wedding dances and the friends' emotional journeys. Music is racy and blends well with the grandeur, despite varied composers. Shashwat Sachdev composes the loony Pappi Le Loon (Sunidhi Chauhan, super), crazy Bhangra Ta Sajda, peppy Bass Gira De Raja and the melancholic Aa Jao Na. White Noise creates the quirky Laaj Sharam and Vishal Mehra the lovely title song Veere and lively Dagmag Dagmag. Qaran's Tareefan is s..s..super sizzling.\n\nThe editing by Shweta Venkat Matthew is meticulous, crisp and in tune with the entertaining and warm tone. Sudhakar Reddy Yakkanti's cinematography is immersive.\n\nPerformances are above par, across the lead and supporting cast. Neena Gupta (Avni's mother) is graceful, Anjum Rajabali and Kavita Ghai (Kalindi's father and mother) are effective, Ayesha Raza and Manoj Pahwa (Rishabh's mother and father) are rollicking. Alka Kaushal is perfect as Santosh Aunty. Vivek Mushran (Cookie Chacha) and Sukesh Arora (Keshav) rock as an everyday gay couple (sans usual mannerisms).\n\nThe few good men supporting the women are talented. Vishwas Kini makes Bhandari likeable and balanced despite the initial creepiness. Edward is earnest as the quintessential husband. Sumeet Vyas is A-excellent and holds his own splendidly opposite Kareena. They are quirkily flawless as a pair.\n\nKS3 are electric and magnificent as buddies. They nail the Delhi banter, camaraderie, body language, chemistry, insecurities, parallel long-distance lives and naughtily push each other's buttons.\n\nKareena Kapoor is exquisitely understated, lending calm and charm to Kalindi. Her eyes do most of the talking. Sonam Kapoor makes Avni delightfully goofy, correct and heartfelt. Watch her regal stance when she interacts with the brazen Bhandari. Shikha Talsania's Meera is sweet as sugar and mad as a hatter as the need arises. Her mother dairy act is effortless and sparkling, she delivers some saucy lines with deadpan relish. Swara Bhasker's Sakshi is the knockout performance in technique and spirit. The masturbation scene will etch her name in history. She's the real bro, effortlessly wild and cool.\n\nRhea Kapoor and Ekta Kapoor, heartfelt gratitude, words are not enough to convey my joy. Thank you for Veere Di Wedding and for not screwing it up. (Except, do go easy on the product placements next time and be confident your movie will earn its own money.)\n\nIt is six on five for the VDW team. The one extra is for educating us urbanites on what an orgasm is called in Hindi. Khh baby khh. Send your thinking brain on a vacay to experience the joys of this Charam Sukhh."

Men get to have bro comedies with no purpose other than to entertain a group of friends, and it's only fair that women should get one too. If you want a deep female led Hindi drama about societal issues, watch Lipstick Under My Burkha, Angry Indian Goddesses, Parched, Lajja, or any other brilliant film with wonderful performances. But women deserve to have some fun in this world too, and that's where Veere Di Wedding comes in. No, it's not the strongest plot, and yes, the acting is a little shaky sometimes. But it's FUN, best served with some sangrias and to be watched together with your closest veeres."

        "review_detailed_main": "A complete entertainer full of comedy, drama, emotions, masti, relationships, bonding & the amazing graph of all these characters.\n\nSTRICTLY no male-bashing, no feminism & no women empowerment naatak. Just a story of four women who face life as it comes. Let's celebrate friendship and be there with each other when we need them the most. It also teaches you to celebrate imperfections and refrain from labelling anyone.\n\nMusic blends so well into the movie. Each song has something to say, there is something for everybody. The sangeet song #PappiLeLoon being my top favorite! Lots of EDM, Rock and Funky Dance numbers to keep you grooving.\n\nThere is not a SINGLE dull moment in #VeereDiWedding! Tight screenplay, hilarious dialogues, unfolding of drama, casual flow of narrative, performance by each and every side cast, all these pluses make the film almost a perfect watch.\n\nEvery action of these four amazing girls, be at the wedding or the vacation, will be RELATABLE AF with the girls. You will know when you see it. These are happy, self-independent, financially secure urban, stylish women trying to sort out personal situations & be friends with life as it is.\n\nThere is no scope of vulgarity (except if you consider cussing as vulgar, which was shockingly allowed in UAE cinemas too for a change). We do cuss in our everyday lives and it was shown as it is in the movie as well, I see nothing wrong there.\n\nVeere Di Wedding wasn't trying to prove to be anything in the first place that it deserved the negativity it did on Social Media. Don't like it, don't watch it, let others do!\n\nMy Favourite characters: 1) Sonam Kapoor - I never thought I did say this but she is extremely cute and adorable when her character is very very confused and cute (very unlike herself), smooth yet strong and holds her base right in whatever she is asked to do. 2) Undoubtedly Kareena Kapoor had to have the maximum screen time. The SUPERSTAR is back with a Bang! A very mature, smart and restrained performance. Kudos!\n\nSTAY AWAY from the movie if you are one of those who get easily triggered by just seeing HAPPY women on the screen! For the rest of us who love Bollywood & love to keep personal ideologies separate from the films we watch, have an amazing time at the theatre\n\nLet's all be PRO-CHOICE & let everyone survive in the eco-system. It is OK to have flaws & it is OK to be what you want. I may just watch Veere Di Wedding again with my other girl-gang and I am totally vouching for a sequel already\n\nRating: 4/5 BOOK YOUR TICKETS NOW!"

My only complaint is that the climax could have been a little better shedding some light what happened after the wedding. But if rumours are to be believed, VDW part 2 might just happen. This movie is of a different genre and should not be compared with Raazi and Parmanu. If you don't have an open mind, simply don't watch it."
