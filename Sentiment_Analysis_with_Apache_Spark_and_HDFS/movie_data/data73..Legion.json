They work at Paradise Falls diner in the middle of nowhere with Percy Walker (Charles S. Dutton). Kyle Williams (Tyrese Gibson) has come to buy some drugs. Sandra (Kate Walsh) and Howard Anderson (Jon Tenney) are waiting for their car with sexual daughter Audrey (Willa Holland). Communication is cut off from the outside world. The group of strangers must battle all of heaven to save the world.\n\nThis movie has lots of interesting ideas and visual takes on this world. It's a shoot-em-up horror crossed with a graphic novel. The problem is that it's extremely underwritten. There is nothing to the story and the dialog is unimaginative. Otherwise it has good action and a few good actors. It's a bit of B-action."

In the meantime in an god-forsaken diner in the middle of New Mexico several lost travellers and the diner's employees surprisingly become a central point to the apocalypse. All because of the unborn baby of the diner's hapless waitress. Soon people possessed by angels appear and only Michael's arrival helps stave off the impending doom...\n\nEven with the above basic premise it is easy to figure out where this movie is going. It that sense it is basically a homage to the brilliant Prophecy series (brilliant more in content than acting or direction). Now I must say that I am extremely surprised by the low grades the movie has on IMDb, given that so many worse movies have ratings in their 6s or 7s...\n\nThere are definitely things not right in this movie with the whole middle sequence surprisingly poor and borderline terrible in its lack of logic - possessed suddenly stop attacking and let the one thing they are preventing from happening happen... That said the acting was at least good and characters are well presented. Add to that a very good fight sequence with the angel Gabriel and I found this movie a good if uninspiring watch."

All Hell (excuse me...HEAVEN) breaks loose. Then just as soon as the film got going, someone stabbed a pitchfork in it and turned it over. It totally changed gears.\n\nOnce the film first set-piece ended it turned into a slower version of Night of the Living Dead. This is largely due to a plot point that set this rule into action: God put a restraining order on all ZombAngels. They were not allowed to get too close to the main protagonist. So without giving anything away; you can now imagine the pacing of the film up to the climax. Slow and uneventful.\n\nThe acting was a caliber above most Horror films. Quaid, Black, and Bettany were all fine. However none were memorable. Even the two main Godsends, Gabriel and Michael, managed to have conflict that was forgotten seconds after the next scene started.\n\nSo I would say it's a \"Catch on Cable\" viewing. Unless you're a huge Bettany fan. Then I would say avoid this like the plague."

The pacing is horrendous. The action scenes are few, far between and horribly rushed and the down time in between them slows to a crawl. This time is used for each of the uninteresting, two-dimensional characters to melodramatically shed out stories of their troubled pasts. We just don't care about ANY of them due to minuscule character development and a horrible script.\n\nThe whole film is terribly written with some questionable scenes that seemed to have been written only for the convenience of the characters. The plot is pretty simple but mostly unexplained and full of holes. SO much is left in the dark and the main point of the film isn't even explained so it's hard to care at all during the supposed dramatic moments.\n\nToo much talking and not enough action for it to be a wicked B-movie and the overabundance of melodrama and terrible writing keep it from being a serious, dramatic epic.\n\nThere are slivers of a good film and some great ideas that occasionally appear and the few, brief action scenes are fairly entertaining, but everything else is so terribly executed that it isn't worth any kind of recommendation."

But the good thing about it is, you can sit back and enjoy it, without having to think about certain story related problems or continuity and other stuff.\n\nOf course if you were to use your brain while watching this, one of the things you'd notice, is the fact that Dennis Quaid seems to have a bad choice of movie roles lately. \"Bad\" if you consider what he is capable of and what he ends up playing (this might actually take under 10% of his abilities to pull it off). But then again, you shouldn't care. You also shouldn't care too much about cardboard cut outs presented as \"characters\". But if you do, this is were I warned you. Which is more of a warning then someone else gave before unleashing ... but you know the rest or are about to see the rest.\n\nThe Prophecy is still the better movie (first one), but for a quick and fun movie, you can always rely on the action on hand here (which is shot very nicely)"

Even with good actors reading it, some of the dramatic parts drag on unbelievably. And there are just way too many of these parts for such a horrible script.\n\nThe plot and characters are underdeveloped, the acting is horrible, and the movie just drags on and on.

Low-attention-spanned action-buffs will find dull, repetitive fights and action sequences.

I say decent, and not good, because that's all it really is. There is a SINGLE DECENT fight scene in the movie. Again, not good, only because of lazy choreography and being too short.\n\nThere is a lot of thought put into this film, it's fairly obvious.

I'm not a big fan of horror movies. This is more like a action/fantasy movie.\n\nBasically this is another movie about the Apocalypse.

But there is one rebellious angel who declares his protection of a mother who is carrying a child who is deemed to be the savior of all mankind.\n\nI am a big fan of Paul Bettany. I have seen almost all his movies and I pretty much liked all of them. My favorite scene from this movie is the grandma scene. I thought that was hilarious.\n\nOverall, this is a great movie.

I would have to reply a resounding 'No.' However, that flies (like an angel?) in the face of the fact that I originally hired it, then bought it on DVD and have subsequently watched it a few times since. What can I say... I clearly have little taste in films! Sometimes you don't want DeNiro's excellent acting ability, or Christopher Nolan's tales of head-scratching, mind-bending concepts. You'll even forfeit decent dialogue and little character development for simple shooting monsters with big guns. And this is what you get right here.\n\nBasically, God himself is disillusioned with the human race and decides it's time to get rid of them (and kill a baby while he's at it). However, God's top angel (played by Paul Bettany) says 'No way!' and decides to save this special child and, while he's at it, all of us mortals. Now, if this sounds like a feat that couldn't possibly be crammed into just an hour and a half, it all takes place in a restaurant by a freeway in the middle of the desert. Our - sort of - winged hero has to help a band of human survivors fend off wave after wave of (fallen?) angels until the child is born.\n\nIt's basically a 'siege' movie. Think 'Assault on Precinct 13' but with monsters attacking those held up in a small, barricaded dwelling. There's nothing more grandiose than that, so if that's the sort of low-brow film you want to watch at the end of a long day's work then you should get what you're looking for. There's plenty of action and shoot-outs and for what it is it's not bad. Just don't go expecting anything too deep and dramatic and you won't be disappointed. Oh and Dennis Quaid is also in it - he tries to act his best with the script he's been given and occasionally comes close to succeeding. But then another battle comes along and you end up losing another extra in a hideous way possible.\n\nIt's not amazing, but then I don't think it ever tries to be. Know what it is and keep your expectations low. Don't worry, there's plenty of time to check your smartphone during the lulls in the action. You won't miss a thing."

Legion went for this, but failed. After seeing the trailers, I was hoping Legion would kickstart 2010's horror'ish lineup into full gear. I couldn't have been more wrong.\n\nLegion is the holy roller's rendition of \"The Terminator\" mixing elements of classics from almost every genre of film. Sometimes, a film can pay homage to cult classics, and give birth to an all new sub-genre. Legion is more like an abortion than a birth.\n\nCheesy dialog during forced character background scenes fill up 3/4ths of the film. The action scenes are few and far between, and what little we are given, is very anti-climactic. From the trailer, we were all but promised plenty of zombie-like scenes of innocent people being possessed by angelic forces to facilitate the extermination of the human race. If this is what you're expecting.. don't. 90% of the \"cool\" scenes of possession are shown in the trailer, the rest are pretty much forgettable.\n\nHaving not seen \"Daybreakers\" yet, so far my 2010 has begun with a dud. Legion is insulting to the viewers intelligence. Save the cash, and wait for this turd to show up late night on the syfy channel."

With such a high concept, it's weird how it's actually taking place in a rather constrained space : a truck diner lost in an American desert. My first impression was that the special effects looked cheap (witness the first human transformation and the way \"it\" talks while barely moving its mouth). It's an impression that stayed with me throughout until perhaps the final antagonist. My second impression was that the acting wasn't that bad. I didn't recognize the actor playing the main angel character (Paul Bettany) until the day after while reading the credits. He's not one we usually see as an action hero in this kind of flick but he gave a decent performance as the strong stoic type. I also remembered Lucas Black (playing Jeep : what a lousy character's name) from the time he was a talented child actor. He still is. We also have the ever reliable Dennis Quaid in a supernatural thriller yet again.\n\nMy third impression was that the little old lady (seen in previews) reminded me of the crazy old gypsy woman from \"Drag me to Hell\". It's no wonder she's shown in previews, it's one of the best moments. However it spoils the surprise. My fourth impression was that following the granny, the \"possessed\" people were rather slow, stupid and not particularly menacing, very much like zombies even though they were not. My fifth impression was that at least the filmmakers were trying to achieve character moments instead of tiring us out with incessant action. My sixth impression ,after the film, was that considering the origin of the possessed humans and the objective desired, it was really ridiculous and unbelievable to proceed that way especially considering the supposedly superior intelligence at work. My last impression is that although it's certainly watchable as a distraction, it's not really effective or a particularly good film in the genre despite the \"angels\", seldom seen in features these days. Don't watch \"Legion\" expecting a big-budget epic fantasy, it's more like an intimate, closed space, last stand b-movie thriller without that many thrills.\n\nRating: 5 out of 10 for mediocre\n\nP.S. Don't watch it expecting a \"legion\" of \"angels\" either. You would be disappointed."

An out- of-the-way diner becomes an unlikely battleground for the survival of humankind as Michael and a group of strangers defend themselves against God's legion of angels. Michael must protect a mother (Palicki) and her baby, for it is the key to ending the Apocalypse. Let me start off by saying that Legion is not a good movie, however, it is not terrible by any means. Unlike recent biblical horrors (The Unborn comes to mind), Legion tries very hard not to follow the lame clich\u00e9s of recent horrors; I always commend a film for trying to be good. Unfortunately, it takes itself a little to seriously with God's legion of zombies that are supposed to be possessed by angels. The film also was terribly written, (\"What's your beef?\" \"Simmer down!\" \"Hold on white boy\") with weird scenes that needed some serious editing. Besides the bad script and erratic editing, the acting was terrible. The only exceptions were Paul Bettany (who seemed to have flown into the wrong movie) and Lucas Black (Sling Blade, Friday Night Lights). Everyone else was uninspired and made the bad screenplay look much more terrible than it was. The action scenes are where this film soared. The fight between the two Archangels was incredible, and the visual effects were on par. Overall, Legion is a biblical Assault on Precinct 13. It lacks a good script, editing, cinematography, and acting. I commend it for trying to be less like recent horror films that really shouldn't even call themselves 'films\". I think deep down, on the cutting room floor, there was something there, but we don't see it. Legion is by no means horrible, but I can't recommend it.\n\nRating: 5/10"

Even lesser known actors were up there doing it with the masters of the industry. Paul Bettany is one of the most underrated actors of our time. When has he ever given anything but a solid performance? Dennis Quaid? His prettiness might be a thing of the past, but as a performer he grows with every movie he makes. The same goes for the whole cast. They all acted like superstars.\n\nYou won't like this movie if you're into mindless B-grade BS.

        "review_detailed_main": "Words can not express just how DIRE, this film really is. It is a confused screenplay, messy plot, and very average special effects.\n\nAs the film started I actually thought that this could have been a modern zombie classic with hints of parody of other films. It was even funny, the grandmother scene is hilarious, as is the stretchy guy. If the film had carried on in this way, it could have salvaged itself. But no. The angel concept was badly considered, there was no explanation of the rational, and frankly if the best anyone's god can send to eradicate mankind is a swarm of flies, followed by a relatively small army of fairly useless zombies, then its no wonder mankind got itself so screwed up! The concept of the saviour child, is not explained, so everything seems relatively pointless. The premise for this film could have been an absolutely epic, apocalyptic feature with feuding angels, fire and brimstone, humanity brought to the edge of destruction, mammoth scenes of human zombie carnage. But No, it was this pile of dross, that was most probably funded by the catholic church in some vain attempt to make angels / religion \"cool\".\n\nDon't waste your life on it. Don't wait for it to come out on DVD. The best thing about this film, was that the cinema we watched it in didn't treat us like criminals after having spent the best part of \u00a320 on tickets."

Most of these films have one decent actor trying to carry a bunch of weak unknowns. Legion has a far better cast than watchers will expect. Every one of the folks in the \"alamo\" is, at least, a very good TV actor and there are four quality movie actors in this crowd.\n\nThe end suggests a sequel, but I'd rather see an extended version which didn't slice out all the plotting which might have made this one hold together better. Meanwhile, it's certainly worth renting."

The plot is that an unmarried young woman is pregnant with a baby boy that will save the world (sound familiar?) and the angels are sent to destroy the baby as God has given up on the world. The most ridiculous plot hole was that the angel-possessed populous became immobile when faced with the baby. What purpose would there be in the angels \"possessing\" the people if the people are incapable of doing anything?\n\nWhen Paul Bettany is on-screen, the viewer is transported and believes. When Bettany is absent from a scene, the movie lags, drags, and fails. Someone ought to give Bettany an award for carrying this movie from \"walk out and demand your money back\" to \"tolerable!\""

When the films ' prophecy and Constantine ' arrived in 1995 with Christopher Walken, Angels became real, but their combined stories were difficult to comprehend. The synopsis explained, a rouge angel decides to take matters to bring about the end of days. In this film \" Legion \" we once again have the same premise. The Archangel Michael has been assigned by God to destroy the last vestige of Mankind's hope and thereby bring about the Appoclypse. However, Michael's refusal causes God to substitute the Archangel Gabriel instead. This battle of the Angels takes place in the middle of the desert in a run down diner wherein a group of strangers have collected. There, the Archangel Michael (Paul Bettany), Bob Hanson (Dennis Quaid), the restaurant owner and his son Jeep (Lucas Black) and others meet and face the Archangel Gabriel (Kevin Durand) and his zombie-like minions. The movie is action packed and frightening. With special-effect scenes and war-like action, this movie will prove exciting and terrifying. It may begin sleepy enough, but the presence of Quaid, Kyle Williams and Charles S. Dutton, as well as the Trumpets from War of the Worlds, will more than wake up the dead, it will make this movie a Classic. ****"

First, the angels were dressed in black and were all somber and gloomy, and carried some really nasty weaponry. Well, if those are the servants of God, then the Almighty Lord is not as benevolent and forgiving as the Bible would have us believe (and I am not just saying that because I don't believe in God). Secondly, an infant born without an umbilical cord? Hmmm, interesting. And thirdly, why do all wicked/evil people just have to listen to metal?\n\nAnyway, the cast was good, and the acting performances good. Bringing some sense of enjoyment to the movie. The sets and props were nice as well, very detailed. And there was a constant momentum to the movie, it never became stagnant or boring, so you were never losing interest.\n\nI watched it for the entertainment of it, not caring about the Biblical aspect, and I think the best experience is obtained by forgetting about the Bible and what you know about Christianity. Just watch the movie for what it is, A MOVIE!\n\n\"Legion\" failed to punch through in a memorable way, for me at least, but it did provide me with entertainment throughout the entire feature.

We began to root for god to destroy mankind so we wouldn't have to listen to these people anymore. We sat through the movie laughing at just how BAD it was! (Think 1950's B-movie, but unintentionally). At some point, we had to pause for a moment and wonder whether it was actually meant to be a comedy, but sadly, no. What a disappointment. The movie had so much potential, but every dimension of the movie fell short of success.

It contains thrills , chills , twists , action-filled with fierce fights and lots of gore and guts . The terror and action moments are fast moving and compactly realized . The film turns out to be a crossover among several films , taking ideas here and there , resulting to be an entertaining movie . And of course the theme of people being stranded in a hostile , perilous environment with attackers creatures is justly reminiscent of many others films as Pitch Black , Pandorum , Descent or Resident Evil and especially from The Prophecy saga by Gregory Widen . The creepy images of wide range from the genuinely fantastic to the bizarre along with an eerie and amazing frames . It's predictable but also its predictability is redeemed for some extraordinary surprises and in part by the charismatic acting from the main protagonists . The violent , bloody and monstrous Angels appearances deliver the goods, plenty of screams, shocks and tension. The make-up assistants and visual effects artists create the truly terrible creatures , accomplished visual effects and adding spectacular frames . Horrifying and astonishing images about eerie events and creepy scenarios are colorfully photographed by John Lindley , and including shading scenes from a dark desert . Thrilling and suspenseful musical score by John Frizzell , an expert on gothic atmospheres .\n\nThe motion picture was well directed by Scott Charles Stewart , a visual effects specialist and who also made a similar terror/apocalyptic flick titled \u00a8Priest\u00a8 starring Paul Bettany, Maggie Q, and Christopher Plummer for producers Mike DeLuca , based on graphic novel by Min-Woo Hyung with interesting screenplay by Cory Goodman . After centuries of war between humans and vampires , the Church assigns warrior-priests to defeat the vampires , and a major priest : Paul Bettany . Previously, Stewart wrote and directed \"Christmas\" starring Seth Green as part of the horror-comedy anthology feature film \"Holidays\" for XYZ Films which premiered as an opening night selection at the 2016 Tribeca Film Festival.

Needless to say, the movie itself doesn't sound that appealing to me.......maybe on a 'Drive In' movie basis, but nothing that can be taken that seriously. The phrase \"Half Cooked\" comes to mind when i think of this story. It was very conflicting, and really didn't make sense at all. When it comes to a story like this, you really need a lot of depth. Because lets face it, the basis of your movie is something that almost everyone on earth is familiar with......no matter what religion you believe in. But they try to sum up everything that made no sense with the phrase \"Dont believe everything you have been told\".......yeah, real original. Your meaning to tell me that 5 hoosiers and 1 fallen angel can stand up to the wrath of god and an army of angels? Yeah, im sorry, but im going to believe everything i know. Not only that, the little demon creatures that you see in the previews......yeah, they are not demons.....they are actually humans being possessed by angels. Which im sorry, i think that was a little dumb on the writers part. And to be honest, the writter made numerous flaws in this script. Yeah sure, the idea might pass if you present it in the right fashion.......but rather than go for credit points with its in-depth story and dialogue........it traded that in for okay action sequences, mediocre acting, pittifull dialogue, and a conflicting storyline that is filled so many holes. Bottom Line.......the best way i can describe this movie is this.......i think the writter and director watched way too many Michael Bay movies before they made this film. It's cheese, laced together with a half cooked story and horrible dialogue, and it tries to keep your interest with action rather than story......which in this case, is not a good thing. You want a crazy action movie like this? Go and watch one of the hundred zombie flicks that have come out......because believe it or not, they make 100 times more sense, and they are a hundred times more entertaining. It's just a plain ol' mess."

        "review_title": "Underrated, Misunderstood Film...maybe hard to get it",
        "review_detailed_main": "I don't generally review horror movies but I feel there is injustice done to this film (so I'm playing the role of Michael against Gabriel and the army of angels). Most reviewers miss the boat on this movie. And missing the boat is easy, since the producers gave the wrong port. Read and you'll get what I mean.\n\nPoor reviews and the box office failure spell doom. The major problem of this movie is that it sold itself differently, like Tiger Woods (lol). Many write they can't believe angels being bad or it was a boring apocalyptic movie. Most people going to see this B-movie are going for the thrills and horrors. We all have our biases and most people think of angels as good and demons as bad. This movie is different and challenges perceptions.\n\nThe plot is a movie of a heavenly battle to bring down mankind. It's not unGod-like as many people say. It happens frequently in the Old Testament...such as Sodom and Gomorrah. The Old Testament Jehovah is a jealous God with emotions. This is not His first time in human disappointment. Michael and Gabriel are warrior-like angels. It seems many reviewers have some difficulty comprehending Michael going against God. (religious reviewers find this hard to swallow and non-religious reviewers find it nonsense...I'm taking a neutral approach and looking at historical depictions of angels). Keep in mind, Lucifer was also an angel. Historically Michael is often depicted holding an unsheathed sword and is the defender of Israel against other angels (e.g., Samael). In this case, he battles against Gabriel. The historically depicted Michael represents all that is kind in God. He was the best choice as the defender of the hopelessly lost (at the diner). Someone commented how could Michael kill the two cops? Well, he didn't. One cop was possessed by an angel and shot the other cop. Michael killed the angel. In Hebrew literature, Michael does battle other angels.\n\nGabriel is God's messenger. So if God wants destruction, he will call upon Gabriel to lead. In fact, the Apocalypse is often depicted as being led by Gabriel who blows a trumpet. Other movies such as The Prophecy with Christopher Walken actually depict Gabriel less accurately as a evil-doing angel. Gabriel is only sometimes depicted as a warrior as John Milton did in Paradise Lost (Gabriel as the Captain of Heaven's Guards). (One reviewer incorrectly mentioned Gabriel is never a warrior). In essence, we see an Old Testament version of God and angels...which is not most people's perception.\n\nThe diner has plenty of lost \"souls.\" It represents a Pugatorial station on Earth. Nothing fun about it. But a great setting to develop the characters for this movie. We see a dysfunction family with the parents fighting and the daughter flaunting. (Nothing new). Bob Hanson, the owner of the diner played by Dennis Quaid is a bit of a loser...and so it everyone else there. Kyle, played by Tyrese Gibson, is divorced and on his way to get custody of his son. He is also armed and not quite friendly. So no one at the diner appears to really be \"good\" or worth saving. Even Charlie (played by Adrianne Palicki) who is pregnant with a child we don't know whose father it was. That sounds like the New Testaments, right? So perhaps she is a Mary figure.\n\nPersonally I didn't like Jeep (played by Lucas Black) who is a simple character faithful to Charlie and his father. We realize he is the \"good' character that Michael keeps faith in. This movie relies on keeping simple characters, all with human flaws. But in a horror movie, it is the standard not to develop the characters too much (with some exceptions like Sigourney Weaver in Aliens).\n\nThe script is actually very good. And most of the acting led by Paul Bettany Dennis Quaid, and Charles Dutton is mostly strong. Most of the movie is spent in the diner with dialogue and character development. The second half is shoot 'em up but by then, if the crowd is looking for a B movie, this isn't quite it.\n\nIf you take the movie for what it really is, it is superior to most Zombie or apocalyptic movies. Compare for example, \"I am Legend\" which really has a weaker script and plot but people love Will Smith so it gets favorable reviews. Or everyone's favorite: \"Terminator\" which really is a B-movie since the script and acting is bad....but it's a cult classic! \"Legion\" has as good acting as \"30 Days of Night\" with a better script. \"30 Days of Nights\" is more fun, however...and \"Legion\" has its fun in the grandma scene, the ice cream man or the kid in the car (trap).\n\nTwo other things I thought were problems: was why not bring Charlie and the rest of the defenseless up to the roof? That was safer. The 2004 film \"Dawn of the Dead\" which was also well-acted (maybe the best zombie film). Near the end, everyone is on the roof (there's an army on the ground. And then the rollover, the baby survived that? But it is hard to believe that Dawn of the Dead got a 7.4 and this movie only got a 5.0.\n\nLegion should have been made with less CGI, less action and marketed differently. Then it might have appealed to a more intelligent, smaller market. Or make the script dumber, characters weaker, and lots and lots of action and you might get a higher IMDb popular rating. Either way."

        "review_detailed_main": "Just watched Legion (2010) It starts like Terminator. It ends like Terminator, Sarah Connor's bandanna included. And maybe even the guns in the back of the car. Several scenes cry out Matrix reference, but hey, it's almost a must. Besides, Matrix fan here, so I guess this could be a biased perception. The first half of the movie looks like an imitation of 'Constantine'. Francis Lawrence and his director of photography ( one Philippe Rousellot) should be proud. I guess. Heck, even Connie's lighter makes a cameo appearance in this film ! Then it's all a messed-up mix of various references. Matrix, The Seventh Sign (1988) Jet Li movies, you name it. Okay, I know it's a post-post-modern world out there. But there's a fine line between ( close) references or homage and heavy borrowing. And when I hear lines like \" Why do you continue to fight? When you know all hope is lost?\" and the hero's answer is 'Fuck you\", my mind stops \u2013 and then in a split second pulls out of the archive the 'Oh! In two hundred years we've gone from \"I regret but I have one life to give for my country\" to \"Fuck you!\"? \u0085 I'm glad Neo isn't alive anymore to hear this. :(\n\nAnd the above reaction/analysis could mean several things. One is that I should stop watching movies in Keanu Reeves movies terms. ( Although it's hard to see how this could be done, as, to quote a friend, I've got Connie engraved on my brain cells. ) . The other, far more disturbing , is that I've fallen into the (amateur) film critic's mind set. Which is something I promised myself \u2013 ever since listening to the film critics' commentary to the Matrix movies ( shrewd, the Wachowskis are ) - to never let happen. Begone, Satan !\n\nStop. Replay. The movie, I mean.\n\n\u0085 and I still see all the above. But I like the idea of Michael being the rebellious one. To quote my friend ( again), \"Gabriel is the decision maker, Michael the warrior.[\u0085] decision makers learn not to second guess themselves - warriors just carry out the judgments [\u0085] which means that the warrior can take a moment to think it over - and second guess..\" I wish the moviemaker would have played with this idea more. Instead, we're given action scenes over action scenes and just a \"You gave him what he asked. I gave him what he needed\" line. And Michael's little chat with Jeep in the still of the night. But I wanted more talk and less fighting. More food for thought and less action scenes. In the same time, a comment on these pages says : \"Jet Li movies have a lot more \"kung fu\". In fact, so does The Matrix, and that also has gun-fu.\" (KentaroK) I had to smile. Oh well, can't please everyone\u0085\n\nAdd to all the above the annoying, 'in-your-ears' too obvious score.\n\nThe film had potential. Too bad the angels got to it first."

At least a 6.5 would have been nice. Now, moving on to the aspects of the film that I feel makes it stand out.\n\n1. It's not like most of the main stream horror movies these days where most of the elements comprises of cheap scares, skin and awful remakes.\n\n2. The story is not top notch but it is interesting. What makes it a bit weak is that the writers tried a pilot project that had the potential but were unable to flesh it out. Still the story passes the mediocre line.\n\n3. The action scenes are executed with dexterity. Not too shaky nor too fast. The main thing is that the viewer gets a thriller without eye strain.\n\n4. The acting was not bad.

It is set in a small desert town where a single pregnant woman is living amongst a close-knit community, working in a small diner. They have no idea who Michael is when he arrives, but they had just witnessed some supernatural craziness.\n\nThis isn't a particularly GOOD movie. It's not meant to be an Oscar winner. It does, however, inspire some thought about good versus evil, giving a different spin on humanity and religion, even if particularly far-fetched. It's also mostly entertaining, with some halfway decent cast members, including Dennis Quaid, Paul Bettany, Lucas Black, Adrianne Palicki, Charles Dutton, and Tyrese Gibson. It's not super well-acted, but then the dialogue doesn't exactly feature great writing. Considering what the cast had to work with, it wasn't THAT bad."

Frankly I'm not interested in its theological accuracy because I don't think this was its point. A tip to begin with: If you want to watch films with religious objectives or for theological accuracy then do not bother with this...\n\nIf, however, you want to watch a fairly entertaining film with some good action (albiet not wall-to-wall, some good acting and a few really creepy moments then give this a go.\n\nThere are some criticisms that I do accept. The characters could be fleshed out more fully and the script is equally patchy at times, but, the film has a mystery about it. The reasons for God's wrath are not entirely clear though they are hinted at, the identity of the infant saviour is not apparent, nor what can be done to redeem humanity. Personally I like a bit of mystery.\n\nIf you don't want to be educated by films (I generally don't) or intellectually challenged (I do at times) or to have your religious views reinforced/endorsed (I don't have any) then I think you should give this a chance."

        "review_detailed_main": "LEGION attracts the viewer because of the cover of the DVD: would Paul Bettany, looking very buff as a cross between evil dark gear under the glow of divine light, betray his fans by making a bad picture? Well, yes. And so is the case for Dennis Quaid, Charles S. Dutton, Tyrese Gibson, etc. perhaps there just aren't many scripts form which to choose that draws actors of this quality into a unintentionally comical dud. But here we are with over two hours of nonsense that may have at its core a good idea but escaped the borders of good taste and character/story development. Scott Stewart wrote (with Peter Schwink - neither with impressive credentials except for 'unlisted special effects' work in prior works) and directed this plodding CGI mess and even Paul Bettany can't save it.\n\nGoing on the prediction that 'when the last angel falls, the fight for mankind begins', Paul Bettany as Michael falls to the earth in Los Angeles, cuts off his black wings, kills a couple of sadistic cops, and steals their vehicle to drive to the desert (apparently in Arizona) where dwells a grumpy Dad (Dennis Quaid) and his son Jeep (Lucas Black) in a little trailer hut cum diner/truck stop. The reason for the destination is that here lives the very pregnant tacky unmarried young girl Charlie (Adrianne Palicki), cared for by Jeep, who is apparently carrying the infant that will save the world after Armageddon: Percy the cook (Charles S. Dutton) just looks on. Michael arrives, a lost man (Tyrese Gibson) with a past seeks information about his destination, a cranky couple with daughter (Willa Holland, Jon Tenney, Kate Walsh) complains about everything and the delay in their car repair by Jeep, and Jeep yearns (it's hard to tell his emotions since his acting ability is minimal) to care for the reluctant Charlie. Out of a flock of flies and other insects come a crazy possessed old lady (Jeanette Miller) who climbs the ceiling, an ice cream man (Doug Jones) who morphs into a silly CGI creation, and a whole flock of displaced persons who are driven by the need to kill the baby in Charlie's womb. The rest of the 'story' is pure CGI stuff which becomes almost intolerably boring.\n\nWith all of the fascination with the approaching prediction of the end of the world in 2012 it is understandable that everyone wants to jump on board a popular topic. Hopefully a sensitive version will come along, one that makes us think instead of cringe.\n\nGrady Harp"

Nevertheless, LEGION is decently scripted with its attempt to serious cerebral dialogue as a more balanced character set in a number of cases.

I thought I was gonna see something better than Gabriel, judging by the fact that it was also about angels and salvation. I was dead wrong. The movie could have been a thousand times better if they only worked on the last 20-30 minutes of the movie. The acting was fairly acceptable, that is if I were watching The Days of our Lives and listen to them whine about their sorry lives. But THIS is a MOVIE and it should have a plot. Sadly the plot was eaten away by, well, the plot itself. The movie's attempt to create a unique and out of the box scenario only destroyed the sole purpose on why the people watched the movie in the first place. I don't want to be harsh and say that this is the worst movie of 2010, but because I wasted my money to watch something that was entirely not to what I expected, I think I deserve to be harsh and say that THIS is the worst movie of 2010."

I have to admit that i hadn't seen any trailer before i started watching Legion. The movie captured my attention when i took a look at the DVD cover. The impressive wings on the angels back reminded me somehow of X-men's Archangel. So i just started watching this with no expectations at all.\n\nThe opening 20 minutes were not that much interesting to watch, but than again i can never stop watching a movie in the middle of it. So if you consider stopping this movie in the first 20 minutes i can assure you you'll miss all of the best bits! So hang in tight and get past the first 20 minutes or so.\n\nThe actions scenes are good i guess, at least i enjoyed them! The best thing about it is that they modernize biblical aspects very well. A modern view on angels and demons if you like! The setting of the movie is rather strange at this diner in the middle of nowhere but than again maybe thats what makes it so special.\n\nIn conclusion this movie gave me more than i expected, as a matter of fact if you could compare it with any other movie i would like to compare it to Constantine that in my opinion really disappointed me, while Legion gave me what i expected from Constantine. Bare in mind that both plot lines are different of course! I enjoyed watching it, really got in to it at times. Not the best movie i've ever seen but definitely not a waste of time either in my opinion!"

This coupled with a very very week plot and an ending that looked so pieced together it is best to save your $8 to $10 and go see Avatar again. The CGI effects are decent, and if you ignore the horrible storyline and just go for the action scenes then perhaps its worth seeing at the dollar movies or wait for it to come out on video.\n\nI gave it 4 stars simply for the effects."

And I can see how the critics thought it was really bad, because there are elements to this film that just aren't good, but the movie as a whole is not god awful like many have suggested. One of the things that does not work in the movie is Lucas Blacks performance, it is very wooden and fake. I haven't really seen him in much, but dear god I hope his acting was better in his other films. Another thing that I thought was weak and underwhelming was Paul Bettany's acting at times. His performance wasn't bad throughout, but there are a few scenes where you just can't take him seriously. Now, for some things that worked. I liked Dennis Quaid, I thought he did a very nice job with his role, and the other actors did well also. The action sequences are constructed well, they're exciting and engaging to watch. The special effects are doable, definitely not the best, but they do the job alright. The pacing is choppy sometimes, going from deep talks between characters to shoot em up action scenes. Overall, I don't really recommend Legion. There are better movies in this genre to be watched. It was alright, nothing too special. 6/10."

However, if you take the movie for what it is, you'll greatly appreciate the fast moving plot, and decent acting. This film isn't about fleshing out characters, or creating sub-plots. If you pay attention, you'll realize it sticks to what the director or studio intended, with some comedic surprises thrown in to try keeping you off-balance. The action is good, the dialogue is decent, and the actors do their part. I would say this will be a successful box-office hit, because of that. You won't waste your money seeing this one. It was nice to see Lucas Black alongside Dennis Quaid. They do a very good job portraying their roles as father and son."

The premise is pretty straightforward and has no depth. Although it could have because of the biblical references. For whatever reason the makers of this movie decided to keep it simple,throw the plot overboard and focus on action.And there you have it, \"Legion\" is an action movie pure and simple. The horror elements are only there to intensify the action scenes. It is not important why events are happening but that that they are happening. Forget about the plot and you will be entertained!"

St. Michael shows up and helps a bunch of folks make a stand in a old diner outside Paradise Falls in the Mohave Desert. One of them is pregnant with the child who Michael knows is the key to humanity's salvation.\n\nThis formula has been done a million times before. Writer/Director Scott Stewart thinks he can get away with using it simply by changing the shape of the antagonist. There are no zombies/werewolves or vampires here, there is something much more biblical idiotic. Surprisingly, Legion is not quite as bad as most people say. It's moderately entertaining. The problems are in the direction.\n\nScott Stewart may have a nice juicy resume for a visual effects artists, but he is no director. His attempts to flesh out characters are noble, but he does it using your basic amateurish over exposition dialogue, and the middle section is bloated, with boring one on one conversations between the six or seven people we are supposed to be rooting for. A good director would dedicate about twenty to twenty five minutes of screen time to character and the rest to action. That doesn't exactly happen here.\n\nLegion is not scary but it is frequently amusing. Among other things I got a kick out of Doug Jones' cameo, as a possessed ice cream man. There is also one short sequence in heaven where St. Micheal and St. Gabriel have a brief conversation about the fate of humanity. Somehow it turns out to be more humorous than was probably intended.\n\nConsidering angels are supposed to be immortal, the whole plot is pretty pointless, but that's pretty much the only way you can treat Legion if you want to come away from it having been somewhat entertained. It probably would have worked much better as a comedy like Zombieland.\n\nA few evocative shots, some silly/fun action scenes, a couple of unintentional laughs, and a mystifying performance from Paul Bettany, are just barely enough for me to give Legion a pass."

Expecting great things and getting nothing but a muddled story, ridiculous plot and a screenplay written by someone with very little spiritual understanding.\n\nTempting as it is i shall avoid the theology lessons and just talk about the film.\n\nThe film has an abundance of serious flaws that ruin it from misguided Biblical interpretation to poor continuity, diabolical acting and ... so on and so on. The action scenes are minimal, telegraphed and not properly delt with. The characters are so uninteresting, two-dimensional and pathetic that you simply just don't care if they live or die.\n\nThe script is weak, the plot full of holes and contradictions and scenes involving mortal men shooting bullets at eternal Angels are so bad it's laughable, when it's actually supposed to be serious. Here's the thing if they'd just gone that step further and intentionally made a bad B-movie that you could laugh at ( i.e Evil Dead) fine, but Legion takes itself too serious and so therefore you don't laugh at the laughable as it all seems just pathetic. If you compare it to Dogma as a comedic narrative with a moral theological plot then it fails to make you laugh as Dogma did, compare it to Fallen with its deep spiritual and demonic thread then the film fails, compare it to Evil Dead well it just fails again. This movie then, fails on every level and it just drags on and on. There's no explanaition as to why this baby in this town makes any difference but honestly by the time you get to that part you're so sick of this rubbish film you really really really don't care.\n\nThinking that Legion needed to be seen in all it's glory on the big screen, It was the first time I have actually been angry that I didn't wait for the DVD. there was one good part, it ended. Terribly disappointing.\n\n1/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I find myself drawn to these types of movies. Which I find strange because I'm in no way religious. But jumping right in. For the most part, this movie is an amalgam of at least two others. The premise is that God has become dissatisfied with humans and has decided to destroy us (again). Only this time, there's no Ark. However, there is a pregnant woman that is soon to give birth, to a baby that isn't supposed to be born, and two archangels. One angel is trying to do what he's been told, destroy humanity, the other is trying to do what he feels is right, save humanity. I'm sure you can see where this is going. Biblically and philosophically, they're on a dangerously creaky limb. Especially for Michael because he's disobeying God's command. It's an old dilemma that soldiers face. Is what I'm being ordered to do right and moral? The stakes are high when your boss is God.\n\nThe ending felt like it was pieced together at the last minute and left me thinking, \"that's it?\" But it did offer an \"inferred\" hint of the future. IE: The Book of Revelation and the Second Coming. \"He came as a lamb; He returns as a lion\". Thereby fulfilling prophesy? If you watch to the ending, it'll make sense when you see all the weapons.\n\nFor those of you that have seen the movie's I've alluded to, you understand my point of view. Did this movie really expand and build on an existing theme or story line? Not really, except for the last 10 minutes \"inferring\" the second coming. And it wasn't done all that well. As I mentioned, it felt like the ending was put together at the last minute.\n\nOverall, if you haven't seen the other movies, The Seventh Sign (Demi Moore) and The Prophecy (Christopher Walken), it'd be an interesting watch."

While I have always felt the horror film was absurd enough without adding religion, all too many genre filmmakers just can't help themselves from persistently pilfering 'The Good Book' and director, Scott Stewart's 'Legion' is more gleefully god-bound than most! Sticking resolutely to a prototypical Romero scenario, a disparate group of demographically divined screenplay archetypes are anxiously holed up in a remote, rundown eatery called Paradise Falls, frantically fending off a ravening horde of piranha-toothed demons all apparently doing the lord's (Skynet!) busy work, namely consuming the fleshly faces of those once so lovingly made in his sacred image and being murderously possessed to single-mindedly kill the fledgling saviour child (John O'Connor). No, I merely jest, as the mewling infant prophet/protector of errant mankind remains unnamed, but, for me, he definitely looks like a John! (Sorry, my bad!!!) As a claustrophobically mounted ensemble piece, the acting is fairly robust across the board, but the especially gifted character actor, Charles S. Dutton's earnest portrayal of the Truck stop diner's demon-beleaguered, one-armed, philosophically-minded short order cook lends the frequently formulaic, clich\u00e9-riddled, bullet-raddled script some much needed three dimensional, flesh and blood humanity. In this increasingly bellicose people vs. Pestilence, bible-pilfering B-Movie apocalypse, the colourfully CGI-assisted action comes thick and fast, doing its boisterous best to noisily distract the viewer from its innately Cameronian premise! Right at the very end it becomes abundantly clear that 'The Terminator' allusions were somewhat less than illusory, since the very last scene has our plucky survivor's drive off into an uncertain future with its portentous, Noirish voice over is practically a straight lift from James Cameron's still evidentially influential work! As an enjoyably hokey, fast-moving, bathos-bloated example of sub-Twilight Zone ephemera, ''Legion' certainly makes for some effectively brainless entertainment."

        "review_detailed_main": "Legion is a flawed but decent action thriller from director Scott Stewart who does a good job of making this movie despite it's problems. I didn't think this film was the disaster critics made it out to be. Yeah it has flaws which I'll get into later and it isn't necessarily the best movie I've ever seen but it certainly wasn't the worst either. Paul Bettany is solid as the arch angel Michael who disobeys gods orders to wipe out the human race and instead decides to fight for them. Thats right people in this film God and his angels are the villains. This may upset some people but I felt it was an interesting twist and it worked for the movie. Paul Betttany is quite convincing as Michael especially in the action/fight sequences. I will give him this too. Bettany's character knows how to make one hell of an entrance. He shows up early on and then he disappears for most of the beginning which made him feel a little short handed development wise. When Bettany reappears as Michael at the diner luckily he's in it more after that. Granted Bettany may not win any awards for this role but he still turns in a good performance none the less. The rest of the cast including Lucas Black, Tyrese Gibson, and Adrianne Palicki turn in decent performances. Black sort of sits out action wise until the third act but he delivers a good performance as Jeep Hanson an average joe whose taken under the wing by Michael. Tyrese Gibson is okay as the mysterious drifter Kyle Williams who *spoiler* sort of disappears late in the second act with no explanation after getting bitten. He does what his role requires through I guess. Adrianne Palicki plays Charlie a pregnant waitress whose unborn child must be protected for somewhat unknown reasons except that he will somehow save the human race from annihilation. Palicki is all right as the character who like Gibson does what the role asks of her. The same can be said for Charles S. Dutton, Willa Holland, Kate Walsh, and Dennis Quaid who are effective in their limited screen time. Walsh however seemed to over act at times and I felt she was the weak link in the cast as Sandra who just complains and complains which kind of hurt the film until she eventually bites the dust. Walsh isn't that bad of an actress but this wasn't her best performance. Dutton is good Percy Walker despite not having a whole lot to do and being written out rather quickly in the second act. Quaid like Dutton doesn't have a lot to work with but he brings what he can to the role of Jeep's father Bob. There was some chemistry between him and Black which made their father/son relationship believable for the most part. Kevin Durand is decent but underused as the arch angel Gabriel considering he's only in it for 15 maybe 20 minutes tops. Durand like some of his co-stars does what is asked of him though. Jon Tenney has what amounts to an extended appearance doing what he can with his very small part before becoming a background character for the remained of the second half who like Dutton and Gibson is written out too soon for you to care whether he dies or not. The rest of the relatively unknown cast including Grandma Gladys, Doug Jones as the Ice Cream Man, and the actors playing the possessed are effective in the few minutes their on screen. The action is well executed and the special effects work for the film mostly even if you can some of it is obviously CG. The showdown between Michael and Gabriel near the end is kind of short because those expecting an epic battle royale between two titans will be disappointed but their fight is pretty well choreographed none the less. The movie seemed to take it's time at least trying to develop the main characters in attempt to make you invested in their struggle before diving into the thick of the action which was a nice change considering films of this genre seem to be more about the spectacle than the story and characters. Now that I've mentioned what I liked about it I'll get into the flaws. Many characters (Gabriel, Percy, and Kyle to name a few) aren't developed enough. They are just there with little to do and their characters can come across as one dimensional. A little more development would've helped because if you can get the audience to care about the characters with action sequences well paced they will enjoy it more than a film that was made purely for the spectacle. The dialog wasn't the best at times with characters making stupid decisions sometimes like running out to save people who already dead only to die yourself because it was a trap. The story itself was okay with an interesting twist (God and his angels being the villains)yet it could've been handled much better. There were some predictable moments which weighed down the film a bit. Overall though I didn't find Legion was the epic disaster most critics made it out to be. Yeah sure it has plot holes and flaws with questions left unanswered but Legion wasn't that bad. And if you give the film a chance which I did who knows you might end up enjoying it. I for one thought it was flawed but decent. Legion has enough action, a little suspense, some character development, and solid performances from the cast (especially Paul Bettany) who make this action supernatural thriller worth watching at least once."

For those of you who say your intelligence may have been insulted by watching this movie should watch it again before encouraging others to follow such blindness. This movie is not all about shooting heads off and creepy crawly's, its not the best movie I've seen, but it should not be simply dismissed because you heard its not scary, etc.\n\nThis movie did for me what 2012 failed to do, which is to tell a revised old age story without all the Hollywood flash and predicable scenes."

Sure it's not the brightest movie and is very predictable but saying it's boring with bad acting and calling it the worst movie of the year as some people are claiming, NO WAY! I've seen way worse movies out there with bad acting like the other religious themed horror movie House, now that one sucked and was a snoozefest. The acting in this film isn't the best ever but it isn't horrible as people are saying and at least they make it interesting and fun in a late night grindhouse flick sort of way and that's fine by me because it didn't bore me but I have to say that it has a pretty random cast of stars in this movie. This was pretty graphic and violent at times but it wasn't as gory as I thought it would be and it was almost more of a action flick than anything but there was some fun, creepy and wacky scenes here and there. My one complaint is that there was too much dialogue and jibber jabbing between scenes and not enough demon attacks and it could of had a better conclusion. Overall it moved at a fast enough pace, was fun and entertaining with a likable yet random cast, had enough action and thrills and at parts was goofy and funny, not one dull moment for me and what else could you want and expect from a movie especially like this one, definitely not the atrocious, dull movie I was expecting. Overall go in with very low expectations, don't take it seriously and you might have a good time with this popcorn flick, I know I did. Recommended! More of a 3.5 out of 5 stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "God lost faith in humanity and sent the angel Michael (Paul Bettany), along with a legion of angels, to start the apocalypse. However, when Michael arrives, he decides to oppose the orders received and protect the humans. The battle stage will be in the interior of the United States, where there is a diner managed by Bob Hanson (Dennis Quaid) and his son Jeep (Lucas Black). Along with Charlie (Adrianne Palicki), a pregnant waitress, and Percy Walker (Charles S. Dutton), they must find a way to survive the angels who want to exterminate them at all costs.\n\nIn 1836 (in real history) a siege of Mexicans arrested John Wayne (this one, in the film produced in 1960) and a lot of people in a fort in the middle of Texas, the \"Alamo scheme\" was created there (before the name of the strong). In fact, my first contact with him was with another film, the four years younger, Zulu, by Cy Endfield (one of the victims of the Hollywood blacklist in the 50s) and starring a young Michael Caine, in which he, surrounded by a tribe of Zulus in the middle of Africa, tries to defend his point. Your Alamo.\n\nPerhaps by definition, this \"Alamo scheme\" (which I may be coining that expression or not), is one where a group of characters need to defend a location, or simply try to survive, while surrounded by an immensely greater number of evildoers. Romero made his Poplar of Zombies (Night of the Living Dead), John Carpenter in his 13th Precinct (13th Precinct Assault), as well as Howard Hawks, well before all these, had Sheriff John Wayne guarding his precinct in the old west (Rio Bravo). A quick look will reveal a lot more of these, especially nowadays, where nothing is created and everything is copied. Scott Stewart's Legion follows this path, badly, but it does.\n\nIn fact, not only it, but a lot of movies, from time to time, come around with this same premise, or a variation of it, which leaves a sloppy impression with every attempt, as if no one else can perceive the weight. Situation and simply use a lazy, emotionless formula. Stewart creates an apocalypse where Archangel Michael descends to Earth to protect the mother of the savior, in the best Terminator style. Turns out she's 50 miles from nowhere working at a roadside diner.\n\nStewart has the tools, but doesn't seem to know how to use them. From the beginning, thanks to competent photography by John Lindley and an interesting art direction, what he has in his hands is a modern look with the face of a music video, which would be consistent with a jet-setting and full of emotion, until the moment when that he seems to realize that his characters have not been developed enough and the rest of the time the viewer is forced to see them divided into pairs talking about their hardships and disappointments. From time to time, it's true, everything stops and a lot of shots roll (with close-up detail on the bullets falling and everything else), but the impression is that at no time are they in danger, as they have enough free time to talk, as if you knew that the only thing that would kill them there would be your stupidities (which of course it does). In the end, Archangel Gabriel sounds his trumpet and shows up, but until then there's a lot of talk and little emotion.\n\nIt's still funny to realize how much this could all be resolved without the initial sequence, where Miguel arms himself to the teeth in a moment \"Commando paraMatar, since without it, those people inside the cafeteria wouldn't have a horror movie in their hands , with an old lady climbing the walls and a bunch of \"zombies\" attacking the place in unison (which must be, since no one remembers to mention the subject, the so-called Legion of the title) as they start to suspect the apocalypse itself . Perhaps a subtler Miguel who brought a message and not a trunk full of weapons, and a \"they are here\", would do a better job, if not at least much more interesting.\n\nThe plot, as you can see, hardly presents anything new, after all, conflicts between beings from heaven and hell have already been seen in numerous productions out there. Legion's differential is that it manages to be fun, without insulting the viewer's intelligence or patience. Director Stewart, with his vast experience in the field of visual effects, uses them well in the film's favor, although there are some very clumsy mistakes, such as the old lady who attacks the group in the cafeteria. Stewart still surprises with his good action scenes and the way he conducts his film, which manages to hold attention.\n\nAt the time of its release, the film had several controversies. The controversy begins at the beginning, the hero (Archangel Michael) is shown falling to Earth, then cutting his wings and soon after a kind of collar falls from his neck. The collar would be a kind of \"divine tracker\" according to the author, yet, for the most fundamentalists, it is symbolism to show that Miguel was free from God's authority, which would be, in the film, being comparable to a handcuff/collar/prison.\n\nGod had lost faith in humanity and so he ordered the angels to exterminate the race of men. Miguel disobeyed the order and descended to Earth to try to save humanity. There's nothing wrong with that, though... it would be Michael the archangel who was supposed to lead the angels in the battle against the demons in Armageddon, and in the movie he does just the opposite. Another interesting thing is possessions. Angels have human bodies to perform their task. So far so good, but here in the movie, they get absurdly scary, in the movie. In the film, people are possessed by angels, not demons (the scene with the possessed old lady in the cafeteria is remarkable). That's one more point: the way angels are portrayed, totally evil. Of course angels, biblically speaking, are soldiers, the problem is that in the movie they are more like monsters.\n\nNow finally the \"X\" of the question. The story revolves around Miguel trying to save a pregnant waitress, whose child would be the new messiah, the only chance of salvation for humanity. The possessed and even Gabriel in his physical form are sent to kill the waitress and the baby. Now, this new messiah would be the child that would give humanity a chance to survive, so he would lead a rebellion against God and thus... he would be the antichrist. That is, Miguel fell to save the Antichrist, and the Antichrist is portrayed as the hero who will save humanity... you understand, right?\n\nDespite a few more holes in the script (it is unnecessary to go into details about them) and some problems in the technical part (such as the already commented scene of the old lady), Legion is recommended for those looking for uncompromising entertainment or for those who love to see the Bible being distorted."

That is exactly what happens here.\n\nThe script makes no sense at all. I don't mean whether it is true to the Bible (it's not), but whether it is true to at least minimal logic and reason. The Supreme Being in this film is not like any I've ever heard of. So all of the \"action\" is caused by the motives of an unknown person. Well, that seems about the same as justifying totally unmotivated actions.\n\nMaybe the relation between the action and \"real life\" was edited out. If characters in the film were supposed to be a counterpart of a Biblical character (there seemed to be some hints), the correlation was not made clear.\n\nAnd I assume the ending was supposed to be a surprise. I was surprised at how incomprehensible it was.\n\nBut there were some fun parts, especially those which make monsters out of little old ladies and cute little kids, thereby authorizing the extremely guilty pleasure of watching them die in gruesome ways (which would be unthinkable in a normal drama).\n\nI don't recommend that you see this on screen. It might make an acceptable late-night film on TV at home, where if you doze off, you wouldn't miss much."

This would have been perfect if we still had midnight drive in's for the b feature, it has its jump scares and rarely a dull moment. If your looking for Citizen Kane you won't find it here, but it's a enjoyable view free of thought provoking questions, sometimes a movie is just meant to be fun and that's exactly what this is. It's fast paced, gory, with plenty of demons and bullets. The dialogue leaves something to be desired but the special effects are good, and just enough story to keep it together. Recommended for a boring rainy afternoon."

Plus this film has got to have on the worst dialogue I have ever heard, not only is it very cheesy it's cringe worthy bad. And for a movie about the apocalypse the almost the whole film takes place at a restaurant. You can tell by the actors and actresses that no one even tried and knew this film was going to be a piece of crap, especially Dennis Quaid who was probably just in it for the paycheck. And the film also has a lot of plot holes, this movie sucked plain and simple. I am actually surprised it actually made it into theaters instead of going straight to DVD. Still not one of the worst movies I seen this year.\n\n3.8/10"

The angels are very real and there are some good innovations, as special effects go,you won't be disappointed.\n\nFor me it seems like this is a 90 minute (or so) reader's digest version of the 5 year TV series Supernatural with dealing with the Apocalypse and good and bad angels.\n\nPS: The Angel was hot, like Castiel on Supernatural too =) eye candy is always great in a good flick LOL"

As a bonus, the movie was good, too.\n\n'Legion' is an apocalyptic (in the making) fantasy action horror film full of surprises and boasts incredible visuals. The acting wasn't really anything to rave about, but it was perfectly suited for this type of film. My only casting criticism was Tyrese Gibson, who - once again - serves as nothing more than comic relief with an indispensable character - similar to his character in the Fast and the Furious movies. Yawn, Tyrese, yawn...\n\nPaul Bettany was good as protagonist demon hunter (and angel) Michael. I enjoyed the characters, who all had a purpose (except for Tyrese's character, off course...). Dennis Quaid is generally good, but I must admit there was nothing special about his character or acting in this movie. Bettany stole the show in every scene. Then again, this film is not about great acting or compelling characters, as it may. It is about a fight between good and evil, and a film laden with special and very good visual effects.\n\nYes, there are flaws, but the entertainment value is very high and there's loads of action and suspense. On the downside, no matter how many times I watch this movie, I still don't understand why this particular baby is so important. Not enough information is given on the baby and why it is so special.\n\nDespite these issues, I do live this movie. It is entertaining and that's what movies are all about. I was entertained, and I have a good time every time I watch it. Enough said!"

That's why films like this will always have some success; there will always be some moviegoers who in the back of their mind will think \"Yeah, that could happen\".\n\nBeing a recovering Christian myself I appreciate it when the Bible, and biblical themes, are exposed for what they are; products of the mythmaking process of Iron Age nomadic desert tribes.\n\nPlus 2 stars for Paul Bettany's performance, but otherwise this film is confusing, derivative and preposterous. Angels fistfighting?!. This is 2010 and CGI is putting incredible things on the screen, and the best this director can come up with is angels fistfighting? This film even steals freely- the sound made just before Gabriel comes is the exact same sound used by the tripods in Spielberg's remake of War of the Worlds. I doubt if Spielberg feels complimented by having his idea copied in this high-school film class project."

        "review_detailed_main": "Is it blasphemous to describe a film in which a Christian God decides to usher in the end of days as being sort of, you know\u0085fun? Fear not omnipotent deities, Scott Stewart's Legion isn't really that good but I'd be lying to if I said a part of me didn't enjoy the campy action/scares, the deep cast, and the back and forth between two Archangels. Amongst all these positives though there is one underlying truth here, this plot is a mess and a half. In a film where dialogue is at a surplus for our band of survivors both human and divine, you would think a lot more time could have been spent on the motivation of the God in question.\n\nFor those frequent and veteran moviegoers out there you will certainly recognize some obvious Terminator parallels. Not necessarily in plot but in some key scenes. Our protagonist Michael (Paul Bettany\u0085typically commanding here as he usually is) arrives in a dark L.A. alley at the film's start. After his intro we get to know Paradise Falls (obvious no?), which is a diner out in the middle of New Mexico. Here resides Charlie (Adrianne Palicki) who is pregnant with Jesus: The Sequel. She is accompanied by Jeep (Lucas Black\u0085and yes he does have deep Southern accent; what 'Jeep' didn't give it away?) who is truly smitten with her even though the child isn't his and nor is Charlie. Jeep's dad is Bob (Dennis Quaid, who puts his accent on a little easier) who co-owns the diner with Percy (Charles S. Dutton). The two men are a contrast of one another. Percy is upbeat and is a believer. Bob is an aging cynic who doesn't even bother with a possibility of a higher being. They are joined by a snobby family (Jon Tenney as dad, Willa Holland as the immature daughter and Kate Walsh who seems to have fun as soon-to-be out of her mind mother), and lastly by hard ass Kyle Williams (Tyrese Gibson, who adds attitude to any picture he is in). All have no idea what they are in for. A possessed Golden girl gives them quite an idea.\n\nThe real success of a film like this hinges on the ability to balance campy with chills. We may smirk at the idea of a grandma cursing her head off and taking a chunk out of a cast member or two. However we also might have the hair on our necks stand up at the idea of a possessed toddler attempting off our supposed savior. The Casting director deserves a bonus. In the hands of lesser actors this probably would be straight-to-DVD. I suppose that is because of how miserably the plot fails here both in the common sense and biblical departments. If God really wanted to 'Noah' us all again would he not have simply sent all the angels down to do the job, instead of having them possess humans who can be killed like zombies? Or can the angels only come down through a human? How come Gabriel can come down from the heavens wielding one hell of a hurt stick? The film doesn't answer. Nor exactly does it answer why God's breaking point came at this point in time. Normally I would pass this off as movie logic but I just so happen to attend church. I'm no adamant disciple but I know enough, or perhaps believe enough, to say that the logic and ideology here needs to be explained because it is simply unbelievable.\n\nRedeeming the film of this flaw is Bettany and the relationship between his Michael and Gabriel (Kevin Durand, please give him a full role Hollywood). Bettany's characters command our attention with their confidence and tenacity. Michael is no different. Thankfully he doesn't get bogged down in too proclamation. He knows what he believes he must do and he does believe in it. The exchange between him and Jeep is perhaps the film's best. Gabriel is his foil, a noble soldier and that is it. He too has belief in his commander. Despite the vast storytelling shortcomings these two give the movie some serious credibility. The performance of Palicki is good in its short supply. She simply doesn't want this, and her immaturity to begin with is surprisingly real.\n\nThere is a lot to consider when watching any film where a specific religion is the focal point. Legion doesn't ask us to check our beliefs at the door, but it still sorely fails at giving us the depth we need in regard to its source material which will seriously turn some of its audience off regardless of how they spend their Sundays. Thankfully the cast provides some likability, and the action provides the thrills. At the end of it all though conflicted and unintrigued the best words to describe Legion. I think the cast and crew were aiming for 'entertaining.'"

Everything about this movie is ludicrous, from the acting, to the art direction, to the ridiculous special effects, to the story itself. Yet somewhere someone thought this story good enough to invest money in this project, which proves once again that, the current economic hardships notwithstanding, there's plenty of money out there. Yet the movie does feature some interesting and amusing scenes, such as the old lady who crawls on the ceiling and throngs of possessed people stumbling around with spinning heads. But enough said. If you want to learn more about the bible, pass on this movie and instead read the book.\n\nWhat is one to do when a old lady enters a restaurant, orders a raw steak and then proceeds to crawl on on the ceiling? This is one of the interesting questions explored in this offbeat but entertaining take off on the apocalyptic theme. The movie has its flaws, such as its rather pedestrian interpretation of Biblical scripture and its rather laughable special effects which could give some in the audience a headache (to appreciate this better one must see the movie). If mankind is at the brink of extinction and must rely on one hero to save it, then we can only hope that that hero is NOT the angel Michael depicted in this movie. Angels are supposed to be powerful all knowing messengers of the Almighty and should be depicted as such. To depict them as being something else is not only stretching literary license to the limit, it distorts the biblical message and reduces the movie to being just another fx extravaganza, interesting to watch but dramatically empty."

        "review_detailed_main": "Since Al Gore told everyone that the world was going to end very soon there has been a noted lack of guidance about what to do when the inevitable actually happens. Hollywood, as always, has stepped into the breach, presenting a series of likely disaster scenarios and how to survive them. The most recent of these is Legion, a step by step guide on evading a vengeful god.\n\nIn Legion, God (Christian, white) has decided that enough is enough and humanity should be punished for all its warring, raping, pillaging and general good times by being extinguishing it. Archangel Michael, heaven's equivalent of General MacArthur, couldn't disagree more and decides to stop his old boss by travelling to earth, robbing an armoury and shooting anything that looks evil (apparently God also has demons). It's not just a straight out fight though, every fantasy story also needs a macguffin and Legion's is a mystical baby that Michael must protect for humanity to survive. It's a little bit like Terminator 2, but with a less believable antagonist, and based at a truckstop in the desert.\n\nTheoretically, an action film with a massive special effects budget and a plot that revolves around gods and guns shouldn't be too difficult to make. Unfortunately, when you combine the two and get the guy who normally does the effects to also write the screenplay it is doomed to failure. Scott Stewart, the writer and director of Legion has done exactly that, managing to make a film that feels like he's just strung a series of his favourite special effects together and then wrapped it in any old hackneyed plot.\n\nDespite the below par narrative, Legion has a reasonable cast. Paul Bettany is convincing as the tortured ex-angel Michael, while Lucas Black puts in a competent performance as Jeep Hanson, the mystical baby's slightly dim step-father. It's sad to see Dennis Quaid being given so little in such a mediocre role, but as the saying goes, you can't polish a turd, and he, like the rest of the cast, does the best with what he's given.\n\nLegion is a difficult film to watch, building up tension before letting it slowly wind down in lengthy character development dialogues, which then usually culminates in a totally unrelated special effect. A more specific and focused plot it could have made it a reasonable film, but as it stands it seems more like a made-for-TV late night special than a Hollywood blockbuster.\n\nwww.theworstseats.co.uk"

And the one liners are so cheesy that they're hilarious. I found myself laughing a lot. The ending was great and reeled me back in. the film would've been better if it had more of what happens at the end. If you just don't ask questions, the movie can be a pretty enjoyable watch."

I Love Bettany, Black, Gibson and Quaid, but I found myself wanting to contact them to find out why they would have allowed this to go public. I am not a writer, director or FX guy, but if I were, I know I could have done a better job than this. The subject matter is the perfect story and almost writes it's self. The special effects, what little there were are OK, but this is like watching a firecracker blow up when you are wanting a stick of dynamite. Please, don't waste your time."

He brings an interesting depth to the moral discussion of free will when he brings a angel who enacts his own free will trying to save humanity from the apocalypse. I think this allowed for a rather deep examination of how we as humans choose to spreed our humanity, and the lack of compassion that we often display, but I digress.\n\nI give this movie a 6/10 because despite its inability to keep the viewers attention it still was able to deliver some good key moments."

This being my first comment I just wanna say that this is by far the single worst movie I have ever seen. Not only am I glad that I didn't give the production and studio company money to go see this steaming pile of crap, but I hope they go out of business forever. I hope the Scientology lawyers sue them into non-existence for making such dribble even though it has nothing to do with them, but lets face it, they have the best lawyers. I\u2018m currently wasted out of my gourd and I still want to pull my brain out and smack it stupid for continuing to watch this all the way through. This is literally the biggest waste of time I have ever done. I think my computer wanted to melt itself rather than have the misery of playing this. My girl is crying in a corner begging to be put out of her misery now. My cat just clawed its eyes out and jumped out the window. My fish drowned itself. And Captain Morgan just left the building. I thought I should let you all know this before I go hang myself since I can\u2018t seem to get the images of this movie out of my head and I've seen leprechaun TWICE!!! Goodbye cruel world. I can see now there\u2018s nothing left for me in it.\n\nHere's my review....\n\nIf you want to go see this movie 1st: Go shoot yourself. 2nd: Should you survive the shooting, consider yourself immortal enough to make it through anything. 3rd: Proceed, as a immortal, to try to find odd prophetic ways of killing yourself since #1 didn't work. 4th: Watch movie. If that doesn't kill you, you are in fact truly immortal. Step 5: Institutionalize yourself along with the writers of this crap as that will be the only thing to save yourself from a eternity of true damnation.\n\n... oh yeah, the review. um... can we say Shatolla here? What's it about... no one seems to know... it has nothing to do with the bible or Christianity or anything that makes any kind of sense... period. In the end you will be more confused than a hillbilly at a NASA convention. The only person who could explain this would be Ex - President George w bush using his \"special words\". I cannot define the stupidity without using abstract dance. $ ^ * % # U ) & ! Did you see that? No? Well let me tell you, it still made more sense that this movie.\n\nI want to take Ronald A. Katz (inventor of \"you have reached Microsoft, please press 1 for Russian and 2 for Romania..\" guy and Peter Schink and Scott Stewart (written by) in a cage with a starving wolverine. Or the Wolverine. Whoever's worse. I ... I.. I....\n\n*chair tips.\n\n\"gag sputter... \""

In response, in particular, to monster92's review...\n\n1. I had not seen a trailer so had no real expectations. You have to be rather naive to think that a trailer represents the entire content of a film. How many trailers for action/comedy films have you seen when the trailer actually contains the best bits? I for one remember my utter disappointment at seeing the first Michael Keaton 'Batman' movie. As a 19 year old life long fan of Batman (at the time, somewhat longer in the tooth now!) and a disciple of the Moore/Miller comic revolution I was thrilled at what. in the trailers, appeared to be a tour de force of action etc. My best friend and I queued for hours in Leicester Square to get in.....and left 2 or 3 hours later feeling completely dejected and disappointed at what we had witnessed. So...lets forget what trailers promise for now, they promise much but deliver little like any form of advertising.\n\n2. I personally felt the action was well paced throughout not a full out 'last 10 minutes of a Rambo movie' but steady and fairly well executed on the whole if at times a little predictable.\n\n3. Of course the acting was 'melodramatic' considering the situation the characters were in. Would you have preferred them to all be relaxed and smiling?? 4. The character backgrounds were telegraphed but in a film with few characters how else can this be done? It seems to me you were expecting a film that consisted entirely of angry angels flying around attacking humans for 100 minutes and no actual plot. Perhaps that is why you feel disappointed.\n\nOther reviewers have cited 'Prophecy' in their comments and to be honest I agree. 'Prophecy' was an amazing film for its time and Walken as Gabriel was quixotic and enthralling. If you have seen 'Prophecy' then consider this film as a CGI remake. It does not have the power of the original (perhaps because it lacks an actor of Walkens ability in a lead role) but is certainly, in my opinion, worth watching as a modern 'remake'. Not brilliant....will be forgotten quickly...but not as bad as some would have you believe (depending on what you expect from an 'action' film).\n\nWorth a watch :o)"

Unfortunately (or fortunately if you have anything against bad scripts and worse acting), these \"living\" characters start falling for well-tested zombie ploys and charging stupidly one-by-one to their demise as the cast narrows obediently to the select (very) few for the final, incredibly stupid conclusion.\n\nAnd through it all runs the thread of God's \"will,\" as articulated by writer or writers who can't possibly have gleaned their craft from anything more complex than Harlequin novels. The God of Legion is easily bamboozled by patronizing angels into destroying mankind with a plague of B-movie zombie-types (who even bite on the old vehicle-by-the-gas-pump trick that George Romero pulled off in 1968), yet bright enough to see the error of his ways, maybe.\n\nEeesh, this hound was painful to sit through.

Actually, the only creepy part of the movie was probably the ice cream truck scene and the grandma scene (both of them were definitely iconic). Moreover, the graphics and the CGI of the movie were terrible and they weren't realistic, at all. Sadly, it was a very boring movie (especially, the 1st part) and it wasn't really intense (except, the fight scenes). The ending scene was definitely predictable and it was just fine.

The scene is set with the archangel Michael (played brilliantly by Paul Bettany) coming to earth in an attempt to save humanity. The majority of the film takes place at a deserted diner in the middle of nowhere and it's a really good spot accompanying the horror theme in the more violent scenes and the apocalyptic brooding of the rest of the film. This does make it sound more serious than ultimately it is; it is played with a straight face throughout which is why I think it doesn't fully work but I also thought it was actually quite darkly comic, particularly certain scenes involving possession of an older person which was hilarious as well as edgy! The supporting cast are very good and everyone puts their all into it but it is Mr Bettany who makes the film more memorable"

My favourite line came from the character who, when asked \"Where did the flies go?\" responds with an exasperated \"I don't know - you're asking me to explain the behaviour of a mother-f***ing pestilence!\"\n\nThis film has the usual portentous end of the world prophesying, but it is laced with good humour, silly shocks, explosions and shoot-outs, acrobatic kung-fu-type fights between warring Angels, and a cast of characters who behave according to character, rather than obliging with the kind of nonsensical behaviour demanded of characters in horror/slasher films where the dwindling cast gets picked off one by one due to their irrational decisions.\n\nThis film is great fun, and though played straight by the actors, provides an amusing and entertaining 100 mins. If you don't approach it as a critic, you will enjoy it."

It has plenty of memorable monsters/sequences, from the cursing granny, to Gabriel's awesome bulletproof wings. It's a B-Movie, and one that is comfortable with how much it can achieve. Some things are left unexplained, and it constantly feels like it is trying to set up a franchise that may never arrive. Still, if angels and guns are a couple of words that get you excited, this is some enjoyable escapism."

Anyway, I preferred Priest a lot more than this one, I was hooked and this movie sadly could not do that. Without the famous actors this wouldn't even be on my radar. Although the unknowns did very well themselves, but let's face it, celebrities sell movies sadly. Unless the movie sells itself, and this one sure doesn't."

Michael, one of the angels, thinks God is wrong and in order to save humanity, he goes to this small diner in the desert in order to protect an unborn child. He says the child is the key to save humanity; however, no further details are given. More should have been said about the baby and why he was so important. So, the people trapped in this diner must keep the angles out. The angels take over human bodies in order to attack, so they are easily killed. That part made little sense, if you have supernatural powers, why not use them. Gabriel, another angel. fights Michael and wins, but Michael comes back again. I didn't get that unless God decided Michael was right and that humans deserved another chance. I didn't like how a lot of things were not explained.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: It was OK, but had a lot of plot holes. It was a good idea, but more should have been done and it could have been a much better film."

Charlie's child is to become a savoir to mankind.\n\nWhat I didn't like about the film - was a new \"savior\" for humanity. That part just got on my nerves a bit because that goes against the Christian teachings. I also didn't like the angels acting and looking too much like demons - that part is just over the top.\n\nI like the film to a degree - it's interesting to watch. A pretty good film to kick back, relax and be entertained but if you are a Christian be forewarned - the angels act and look demonic at times.\n\n6/10"

This has a nasty habit of heating up quite nicely only be let down by sluggish pacing and an overly long run time. There's a scene that by the end amounts to the best part of the film which features a freaky old woman that as it happens is more funny than scary, and if the film had carried on at that pace then this could have been a halfway good watch, but sadly no, as the rest of the film is hardly worth watching.

A lot of the film is a shoot em up that is hard to follow and frankly boring. Dennis Quaid is totally wasted in this doomsday vehicle. I suspect it was strictly a paycheck for this aging leading man. Paul Bettany as Archangel Michael comes off only slightly better. CONSTANTINE was superior to this, and CONSTANTINE sucked. You may safely skip it.

Because as crappy as this is, (and it is indeed crappy), it is good-bad rather than just bad-bad or even boring-good.\n\nIt knows that it is ultimately a trashy flick and rather than try to elevate itself above and pretend it is something it is not, it embraces the trash and actually turns up the ham-ometer to 11 in the last 20 minutes.\n\nAn angel lands in Los Angeles 2 days before Christmas. How do we know he's an angel? Two words: Big F*cking Wings.\n\nAt least initially, he promptly cuts off his wings, marinates them in a light sauce and finds weapons. I made part of that sentence up, you guess which.\n\nMore things happen, but ultimately the ex-angel and a bunch of random characters end up at a remote diner on a highway seemingly in the middle of nowhere called the Paradise Falls Diner.\n\nKooky.\n\nThe diner is owned by Dennis Quaid and staffed by his son, a cook and the waitress Charlie, who is pregnant. Charlie is the only character worth naming here (even though the other guys are fine and actually include some really good actors), you'll see why soon. Similarly the clientele of the diner includes a family with a teenage skanky daughter, and a black guy.\n\nAll up there are 8 people in the diner\u0085 Until a kindly old lady shows up and after a friendly chat with the staff and customers, she orders a rare steak, swears profusely, rips out a throat and climbs the ceiling.\n\nAll in roughly that order.\n\nOnce the old lady is dispatched all involved are understandably a little perturbed, and after an aborted trip to the hospital (Cut off by swarms of insects. Might I suggest a plague?) it becomes evident that everyone is trapped by a storm that is encroaching on both sides.\n\nNow Paul Bettany shows up as the ex-angel Michael and this is where things get even zanier. Michael is grim and serious but not very enlightening, even though he always seems to be holding back a chuckle. His only warning is \"They're coming\", and to barricade the diner and brace for impact.\n\nWhen the full on assault arrives, it is driving an icecream truck. I mean, what else would it be? Once Mr Icecream truck driver is no longer a more typical horde show up, consisting of people that have been possessed by something. All need dispatching.\n\nBy this stage you might justifiably be asking \"What the hell is going on?\", I was.\n\nTrust an ex-angel to sort us out. During an inexplicable lull in the attack Michael explains: Charlie the waitress is pregnant with a baby that can turn the tide in an angelic war. Michael is trying to protect it, everyone outside; including the aforementioned Icecream man is trying to kill it.\n\nGlad that's settled then.\n\nThe final 30 minutes had me grinning from ear to ear as I struggled to accept that the filmmakers actually believed that they could pull this off. There were fistfights, sword fights, gun fights, an exploding husband, redemption for some, doom for others, swarms of baddies being slaughtered and much preposterously pompous dialogue.\n\nThere was a heap ripped off from The Prophecy, a bunch from The Terminator and it was all topped off with some all-original Legion cheese.\n\nAnd it was all funny as sh*t.\n\nI dunno, this was never going to be a work of art. I guess it is up to you if you can muzzle your bullsh*t detector and spend the 90 minutes watching this stuff. For some reason this mostly hit my funny bone, not my gag reflex, so while I fully admit this is a steaming turd, I thought it was hilarious.\n\nFinal Rating \u2013 6 / 10. There aren't many more enjoyable 6 / 10 films out there.\n\nIf you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "Legion brings forth a somewhat new perspective. Its setting is in a somewhat post apocalyptic era in which the city is deserted and little to no people are out. However a cop just happens to be on patrol and the story begins when he is possessed by \"God' apparently. The angel Gabriel chooses to break away from God. The basic run down of the story is that an angel, who leaves the side of God because he has a plan to wipe out the human race due to his resentment for his own creation. A savior is born however, the very angels that God sends possess the humans and their sole mission is to kill this pregnant woman and her baby so that the human race is destroyed. The plot is quite interesting but overall this film just does not deliver.\n\nThe trailers for this movie basically showed all of the action within the entire movie. It leaves you feeling cheated, the whole movie is just talk that can get somewhat confusing if you don't pay close attention to it. The action scenes however are very impressive, my favorite part within the whole film is when the ice cream truck approaches the diner, and steps out and his arms and legs grow double their length and he attacks the stragglers. But this is ultimately cut short when he is shot, guesstimating his entire screen time was about 60-90 seconds which was a big let down. As the movie progresses you begin to think which isn't at all good. The movie just leaves your mind plenty of time to wander when it should be focusing on the movie. Towards the end of the movie, all of the characters that the typical movie viewer would become attached to die. This movie just continues to annoy you, but the actions scenes and creative plot line is really what gave this movie a 70% Overall if you have some time on your hands, and you want to see a decent movie this is probably the movie you're looking for."

I predicted every scene, every death and the way it is going to happen, every jump scare and every dialog. Actually, if I think about it, I could have told you what the movie was going to be like after watching the trailer and thinking about it a bit.\n\nI can honestly say that the only scene that evoked any kind of feeling other than amusement was the dialog between the angels Michael and Gabriel, where Kevin Durand, best known for cardboard characters in all kinds of sci-fi movies and series, displayed something that was akin to emotional range. It just jumped at me because he was the last I would have expected it from, when playing in a movie with Dennis Quaid, Paul Bettany and Lucas Black, but really... if I have to choose, he was the best actor all around, the others could have just as well been computer generated characters (and I mean their personality here).\n\nBottom line: no wonder the world is turning the way it is when God throws random acts of pointless rage and the angels are incompetent even when acting like demons. Did any of the possessed notice the object of their murderous query was hiding in a gas station? Best served intoxicated."

The trailer looks compelling too, so I decided to watch it, despite another reviewer here in IMDb told me not to, whom I should have listened to.\n\nThe story is, an angel called Mike refused to carry out Apocalypse and decided to defend survivors in a highway service area.\n\nThe beginning scene where Michael cuts his wings is quite a surprise, but then the actions are boring and completely expected. The dialogs before granny turned to a zombie were completely dull and not related to the theme at all.\n\nThe scene where the bugs shaded the sky was fascinating and I thought the movie is starting to be fun, but I was wrong. The movie turned out to be an average zombie movie after Michael the angel arrived. Now that we know the mighty god's Apocalypse is carried out by angels enchanting everybody to be a zombie to kill a baby in one of the survivors womb. The world-wide Apocalypse is just about a few survivors shooting baby-hunting zombies(or angels) in a service area in the middle of nowhere! The thing I don't understand is, if angels can enchant all the LA citizens into baby-hunting zombies, why don't angels enchant those people inside the restaurant too? Isn't that a apocalypse war should be like angels fighting with telekinesis power? The last 30 minutes actions are pretty good though, the scene Gabriel spinning his metal wings and swinging his utility hammer is very cool. The angel dual fight scene is the only reason I'm giving the 3 scores. The ending is nothing but just funny. Mike came back from dead and killed Gabriel with a bang because god wanted love. Come on, why didn't god say it earlier and save us all these troubles?"

(For sheer creepiness, you can't beat \"The Prophecy.\") The story is a well-worn one, but not offensively so. It's pretty much a combination of every stuck-in-a-diner movie and zombie movie you've ever seen.\n\nThe first hour or so is acceptable, though the CGI FX are pretty lame. Bettany is actually pretty convincing, while everyone else (including Quaid) is a stereotype. Forget about the plot, though, as it makes no sense whatsoever. Editing is par for the course, which means a lot of confusion during fight scenes. Pacing is not as good, as the film has very little flow.\n\nOne area that is above-average is the sound. (I watched this on Blu-ray with a decent system.) The surround effects are definitely nice, though they don't define the standard or anything. One thing that really jumped out at me were the gunshots. Most filmmakers are total losers when it comes to gunshots, reducing the volume significantly and using some canned sounds that are totally inappropriate for the specific weapon. The gunshots in \"Legion\" are pretty intense, which adds to the tension during gunfights. (On the other hand, the stupid armorer/prop master for the film pulls the usual newbie mistake by handing several of the weapons to the actors with only a round or two in the magazine. The actor fires the required number of rounds, the slide on his pistol locks back indicating that the magazine is empty, and the actor just keeps on firing in the next shot without ever reloading. In most movies, you'll see that the slide locks back at the completion of every single shot. Are these guys idiots, or what? You can get around this by loading a snap cap after the last round so the slide doesn't lock back. This ends the shot with an inert round in the chamber.)\n\nSo....I give it five stars. Better-looking and sounding than a lot of films, but a disappointment in many ways, particularly the story."

But when it touches on it's back story or history, it doesn't warp it in a sense that it rapes the facts to serve the film's storyline. It's quite on par and the explanations, when given, are brief, accurate enough and don't make the hair on the back of my neck stand on end. So, I check off the history and now I can enjoy the movie\u0085and I did. I'm not all business, mind you. I enjoy comedies and action movies and all sorts of genres, but it seems I gravitate to historic venues. I must say, I really enjoyed 'Legion'.

I love most end-of-the-world and survival movies, especially supernatural ones with zombies or vampires.\n\nWhile I never wanted to walk out of the theater, there was little keeping me in my seat.\n\nThe acting was strong enough, considering what they had to work with. (Except for the actor who plays Dennis Quaid's son : Jeep). Where the movie went wrong is with it's action and its overall story. The few action scenes were lame. The battles made no logical sense, and just served as \"insert battle here\" to keep the movie going. Considering the purpose of the attacks in the context of the movie, each and every individual battle was useless (considering these attacks were planned by God...).\n\nWe are never given explanations for any of the key points in the story, we are expected to sit back and watch angels and those possessed by angels fight it out for some reason or another, among several paper-thin characters.\n\nThe two creatures shown in the trailer (the reason anyone is interestd in this movie at all) The wall-cralling granny and the stretched ice cream man... they serve no purpose whatseover. In the context of the movie, they still make no logical sense as to why they were sent in on their own. They are just pretty pictures, and are probably the only two memorable scenes in the movie.\n\nThe movie is filled with unexplained plot holes (and Terminator similarities...), including a couple which render the entire movie nonsensical. This movie is just a light show, with nothing memorable, and nothing new to bring to the genre. Skip it and wait for the next one.\n\nThe Book of Eli was much better, and Daybreakers was mildly better.\n\nNote: Dennis Quaid always gets a bad rep for making a slew of lame movies and playing the hammiest character in them. I actually found him very likable in this movie along with Charles Dutton. The acting was the one strong point in the movie. (well maybe not strong, but it wasn't bad)."

One of Michael (Paul Bettany) just prodding around what we later assume (if one even cares to try and figure out the plot after seeing it) is downtown LA. He cuts the area where his wings were, and sews the wounds up.\n\nTyrese Gibson shows up at a diner and seems very strange, like he's on the run or something, but that's not explained either so who cares. Then there's some talk in the diner, every character gets their chance. Including Dennis Quaid, who obviously thinks the script is garbage and just plays his character comically (to good effect).\n\nSome old lady shows up, and from the camera angles and score, we know there is something not quite right. Then crazy stuff happens that isn't really explained, Michael shows up, there's lots of fighting, Gabriel shows up, nothing is explained. Mankind will either live, or die.\n\nI found this movie weak on plot, and it's lack of follow through on any of the major plot points is a let down. However, take the whole thing with a pinch of salt, laugh inappropriately and Legion is not all bad. One wonders whether the humour was intentional, but it certainly is there.\n\nLegion really is only for those who enjoy to laugh at a ridiculous plot and scenes that are seemingly random. Also, the action isn't half bad, but you really don't root for any of the characters, so it comes down to seeing the best explosions/deaths. 4/10."

Legion tries to show a handful of depressed people in the middle of no where struggling to stay alive, and does this poorly. What it does show is that God in his wisdom cannot make up his mind. The angels are fighting over the same things we find ourselves fighting over today. Should the word of God be taken literally or not, and for my money this movie picked the right side. The acting was OK, but the dialog was awful. My wife we went with me to this film commented about halfway through that it appears they where going for Dogma meets the terminator and this would correctly sum it up only they failed to capture the idea of either one of those movies."

The fact that angels possess human beings and have them murder and harm other human beings is preposterous. I am not religious at all, but even as a non-believer I had a hard time hearing angels toss out the F-bomb over and over again. I had a hard time watching innocents (children possessed) killing other folk. This movie is awful and should be avoided---the DVD would only serve one use---to use as a coaster to sit your drink upon while watching something else."

At its origins it is full of good ideas, but somehow, on the way, thanks to a mediocre writer, a weak director and an awful, annoyingly awful editor, it falls apart, down to its atoms. But let's take it a bit slower: although some might find it too religious, others sacrilegious, the idea, the foundation this film is built upon is not that bad. And one could have turned it into a metaphysical art-film, or into an action flick. When chosen the second path, it still presented lots of opportunities, chances, which were lost one by one on the way. With all the weaknesses of the crew falls the story apart. Sometimes its an action flick, sometimes a zombie apocalypse, and so on, but it never manages to decide upon one. It has great actors, it has buds of character-development, as clich\u00e9d as it is, yet, without much reason and remorse throws those away in ways that just don't do justice to the characters motivation, only serve them to a more or less inventive death. By the end it loses completely any sense, but by then we couldn't care less. To sum it up: \"Legion\" is another Hollywood blockbuster wannabe that just never made it. And it never will. Ever."

The acting was bad - I felt a bit of second hand cringe for the actors while watching it.

        "review_detailed_main": "What angers me most about this movie is that it had potential. The idea is that God has lost his faith in humanity once again and he has sent a legion of angels (hence the title) to wipe out the human race and the only thing that can stop them is this one woman's baby. I never thought it would be a masterpiece by any means but I did hope for a fun popcorn flick along the line of The Expenables. However, now that I have seen the final product, there has been no such luck.\n\nFirst of all the only good thing in the movie, the effects. The look of the angels are really inventive as other than Paul Bettany, who plays the Michael who is the good angel whom God banished and is helping to save humanity, and Kevin Durand who plays Gabrial who has wings of steel (I'll get to that). Other than that all the angels are depicted to be these demonic creatures almost as if God has recruited hell's minions to aid him. Also Paul Bettany plays his role well, it's nothing special but at least it's better than every other performance in this train wreck.\n\nThe rest of this movie is just, just god awful. The acting (with the exception of Paul Bettany), the overly serious tone and the countless dumb moments that either make no sense or are just unintentionally funny. You know when you have found a bad movie when you have good actors in it and they are terrible, Legion is one of these cases. When you have Dennis Quaid in a movie, and he is terrible in it, you know something, somewhere down the line went wrong. My guess why the majority of the movie is so laughable is the script. There are so many bad lines in 30 minutes of this film than most B-Movies have in there entire run time. Also the fact that it takes itself way to seriously. It wouldn't bother me if any of the movie had a remotely serious moment but it doesn't. Not to mention what seems to be an endless stream of dumb moments including a moment where an old lady demon bites a man's neck and starts to climb on the walls. Also, the fact that Gabrial has wings of steel just made me think of Batfink and that's not good. When you have something in you movie that reminds people of one of the cheesiest TV show ever, that said I'd rather watch Batfink than this piece of s***. It's moment like this that make me check out of movies and wonder why I put up with films like this.\n\nIn conclusion, Legion is definitely the worst movie of 2010 and one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It makes no sense why movies like this keep getting made, they have very few if any redeeming features. This movie belongs in the pits of hell where no one would ever find it. Unless you want to keep spreading the film version of herpes throughout your cinema, stop seeing these sorts of movies."

The mindset for this film must contain an active engagement with the story and ones ability to see it as the director envisioned. This contains some of the best CGI fighting sequences I have seen. For anyone commenting on the plot they should regard the film in its entirety. The biggest flaw is not taking advantage of the PG-13 market which would probably sacrificed the films integrity. The plot is not distracting like it was in transformers two. Though the action scenes alone are well worth the price of admission.\n\nIn the end take this movie head on with an open mind and be prepared for some angel on angel action! lolz"

It's possible it looked good on paper and went downhill during production and post-production, so you're off the hook this time... just.\n\nNote to everyone else: steer clear of what will surely be the year's biggest flop. Legion is cram packed with unintentionally laughable dialogue, awful acting and shocking special effects that would struggle to meet the CGI standards of 1985. It's a shame everything fails so epically though as the trailer promised some dumb 'tattooed angel blasts his way through meaner angels' amusement, as low-bar-setting as that is, which could have passed as b-grade schlock if nothing else.\n\nWriter-director Stewart attempts to add a moralistic message \u2013 be kind to your fellow man and try to do right \u2013 to the proceedings but when the very next scene involves some preposterous spider-alien-thingy driving an ice-cream truck it only serves as another reminder of how this film gets it all wrong.

I will have to agree with Shawn Savage...the back story dialogues REEKED of cheese and lulled the watcher to a semi-catatonic state. The only redeeming quality of this movie was Dennis Quaid, and even HE looked like he didn't want to be in it. I wouldn't for a moment attempt to entice a viewer into watching this movie...it's OK for teenagers freshly burnt on whatever pot is fashionable these days but for the average SANE adult it is mildly insulting to have spent the exorbitant sums that the theatres charge for admission."

        "review_detailed_main": "Besides some really cool special effects, this movie was pretty bad. I heard that it was rated horrible because of the whole religious background. Saying that God is tired of humans so he basically wants to kill them all off. That angels are bad and he also controls demons. So I had to watch this. I love movies that push the limits. But when it was over, I realized it was not the background making the film bad, but the story itself. It was all over the place and just ended to sudden, you would think it was a joke. Some of the cast was OK, others I feel sorry for. Dennis Quaid has a horrible character and did not really get into it. It seemed like a joke. The girl that the movie was based around is Adrianne Palicki. Not a great choice for a main character. The only guy I really enjoyed watching was Kevin Durand who played Gabriel. If I was to think of an evil angel for Gabriel, Durand had the look and the voice for the part. Now Paul Bettany played Michael and he looked and sounded the part also. But he came off a little wimpy. I really wanted to see some cool fighting with him. I got one good scene and that was it. The film again had some interesting scenes that were both cool looking and even a bit scary. But that did not help make me enjoy this film when it was over."

See \"I was a shorty\".\n\nThe set was decent enough. It was isolated and offered everything a horror/action/thriller should.\n\nThe angels themselves were disappointing. They waited around for the humans to get ready. They didn't even try to kill the more possess them half of the time.\n\nIt's riddled with plot holes. Why is this baby important? Why are the people possessed? Why not have a more catastrophic means of destroying the world. Seriously wouldn't a mass fire or possibly another flood do it justice? Or is that not 'cool' enough?\n\nIt's full of unintentionally laughs. The scene with a little boy and a knife is certainly a good example.\n\nIn conclusion it only offers some good actors, who deliver performances ranging from mediocre to slightly good; some awesomely unintentionally funny scenes; and a decent premise that was not at all executed right.\n\nThis could have been frightening and intense but sadly it wasn't."

But I tend to judge a movie by what the makers were trying to do, and I think Stewart is trying to tell a \"Lifeboat\" type story here -- yes, the whole angels vs. humans thing is going on, and that's not spoiling anything if you've seen the trailers, but the focus is on the characters trying to survive it.\n\nAnd those characters are well written and acted. Focus on them, and this film is a good character-driven action drama with an apocalyptic horror backdrop. Focus on the supernatural action movie you imagine this is, and you won't enjoy it. It's as simple as that.\n\nI liked the movie a lot once I figured out what kind of movie it was. The only problem I have with it is the way it ended. Without spoiling it, it left things open for a sequel -- way too open, without really concluding or explaining anything. The conflict is ended, and it seems unlikely that it will happen again, but more questions are raised than answered about why this happened, and the future of the world is uncertain. The good news is that since the film is really about the characters, and since the characters' individual plot lines seem to have been resolved, one way or another, I'm not left unsatisfied by the movie on that level.\n\nAnd I totally agree with other reviewers that scenes that are supposed to surprise the audience shouldn't be shown in the trailer -- I really wish they wouldn't do that. The trailer should give you some idea what a movie's about, and maybe show some cool scenes, but it should NOT spoil the movie's surprises, and _Legion_'s trailer spoiled it."

I was expecting something a bit more serious, not a messed up, illogical and crappy movie that should have been written with a way more serious approach! I would really like to see some good writer write a script based on this idea because the idea it self promised a lot! Too bad it wasn't developed to be so!\n\nLegion is a terrible movie that can be seen once but don't expect a good time or something! A bearable time, maybe! But definitely not a good time!

One angel, Michael (Paul Bettany), rebels, and comes to earth to protect an unborn baby who somehow holds the key to getting back in God's good books and saving humanity. Said baby is in the womb of a woman working as a waitress in a little diner on the edge of the Mojave desert, and she and a group of people will be trapped in the diner as the Apocalypse is unleashed. So, from the start, there will be those who will be offended by the plot, and they should skip the movie. If you are looking for a mind-bending theological thriller/horror, you can forget that, too: the movie's own internal logic is fuzzy to say the least. What's left is to do an action/special effects movie that concentrates on style over substance, and that it does pretty well. The actors also do an amazing job of selling such a weak storyline and script, with Dennis Quaid and Lucas Black especially good, along with Bettany, but the real stars of this film are the special effects and stunt people. Great effort is expended on scene after scene, and the results look polished and slick. But as a total movie experience, this is, at best, a guilty pleasure, and the scenes of character development are, well, mostly boring (although there is one terrific father-son advice scene with Dennis Quaid and Lucas Black early on in the movie). So, if you want to kick back and have a beer and pizza action Apocalypse movie, it's at least very competently done, but for most, this is one you can skip without fear of incurring the Almighty's wrath...."

As a supernatural tale about a God, presumably the Christian version, giving up on mankind it's an original idea for a plot and it's not half bad especially due to some of the casting, particularly the talented Paul Bettany. He's out to prove this God wrong in a diner in the middle of nowhere where a waitress is carrying the future of mankind if it is born?! Bettany is good enough, Quaid is in his scenery chewing mode, Kate Walsh seems to be having a good time and there are a few more people for some reason all in this remote location when this begins. That's about it. The rest is about Bettany and another angel duking it out to save or not save mankind."

Almost to the point of it being silly, and similar to the aftermath of any \"Terminator\" movie concept which involves the 'one' and only baby that can save the world from destruction kind of thing therefore it must either be destroyed or to be saved at all costs. Again, too much familiarity with other films doing it better and downgraded by some one-note characters with some obvious annoyance particularly the Kate Walsh character as Sandra Anderson, and idiocy with the Tyrese Gibson character as Kyle Williams. The movie also stars Dennis Quaid as Bob the owner of the diner and Lucas Black as Jeep playing his son."

There's a fine line between telling a great story and preaching at someone and I found myself getting irritated at the heavy handedness in this one.\n\nTo sum up: 5 out of 10 stars for good acting, and an interesting premise, but it goes south after midpoint, and it's a bit too preachy."

The writers seem to have raided a script store and taken scenes from about 20 different films, hoping nobody would notice when they are all put together.\n\nYet through this dense jungle of sheer movie awfulness some sunlight squeezes through and we get occasional glimpses of the blue sky above. Dennis Quaid plays a gaunt haggard old man owner of a run down grease pit of a restaurant in the middle of the desert. The character and his circumstances seem to painfully mirror Quaids own life and you wonder how much he is actually acting. But none the less he holds the film up from oblivion giving a competent performance. As for Paul Bettany he goes at each line which such passion and energy you would think the director fooled him into thinking he was making a lost Shakespearian play. But his 80's petshop boys collarless jacket is unforgivable.\n\nOne of the most entertaining aspects of this film is how oblivious the actors are to how bad the script is. They go at each scene as if it is has Oscar wining potential. They pour out their hearts and souls to dialogue that would be too cheesy in a daytime soap. It's the fact that the director, actors and the FX department are so committed to this film that you can come away with some entertainment value. There are some good action set pieces; however the best two have criminally be used in the trailer, diluting their impact. You have some good actors, although mixed with some more wooden that an oak tree. The religious aspect of turning angels into commandos with weapons skills that would put a navy seal to shame is going to be in poor taste to some. To sum up it's a bad film but does have some entertainment value, not a film I would ever recommend paying to see, but might not be a bad choice on a late night when nothing else is on."

Perhaps it's the choppy pacing or editing, or the uninteresting cinematography. At any rate it never really grabbed me, though I would recommend it, provisionally, and there are several moments when it works well. I don't often find myself in agreement with critics, but in this case, I might. It's not as good as \"Zombieland\" or \"The Crazies\" though it is blacker than both and some might disagree. Dennis Quaid often finds himself involved in trashy B-movies (\"The Horsemen\",\"Pandorum\") and this may be another case. His role, in fact, is interesting. He plays the owner of a diner in the remote desert whose bimbo pregnant daughter, who works as a waitress at the diner , lives out back in a trailer. She later turns out to be the movie's New Madonna. A traveling couple and their teenage daughter, who stop by the diner, are in the wrong place at the wrong time. A swarm of insects is the first sign of impending doom. Paul Bettany as an avenging angel could also be cast in Clive Barker's Book of Blood. He makes one grand entrance out of a ring of fire, and another out of a car. As the movie progresses it turns into a zombie-fest, as some movies are wont to do. The most interesting character, in the latter portions, is an avenging child zombie. The avenging and protecting angels then engage in an Epic Battle which is, somehow, less than Epic. The movie ends on a positive (?) note but by that point I did not really care."

It's a companion movie to the same director's equally disappointing PRIEST, two films which never seem to break out of a predictable Hollywood B-movie mould.\n\nThis one's pretty much a single location movie in which a bunch of strangers are holed up in a desert diner and trying to survive against the odds. Bettany underplays it throughout, but he's an acting colossus compared to a rubbishy Dennis Quaid (playing a character who boozes throughout the production) and his equally unmemorable acting companions. The only exception is ALIEN 3's Charles Dutton, whose screen time is all too limited unfortunately.\n\nLEGION has plentiful action but none of it is inspiring despite a handful of grisly shock scenes. Instead this seems to be a movie which borrows liberally from the likes of THE PROPHECY, ROSEMARY'S BABY, and at the climax THE TERMINATOR, particularly when Kevin Durand's character comes into it at the end. The most noticeable thing about the movie is the lacklustre quality of the script, complete with insipid dialogue and a lack of realism throughout. Give it a miss."

There is a bit of action and a lot of dialog, although a movie not necessarily must be only action. The plot is simple, but wants set the attention about the life value, a value which seems to be despised in the relativism and hopeless of what we commonly call \"modernity\". The movie says that the comfortably egoism gives illusion of freedom, but makes people incapacitated to show love, making them suspicious, individualistic in continue familiar conflict. It will be a challenge for human beings but also for angels: \"love is hard but possible for people choosing to have faith in it, and could became a challenge also for angels\". Good the interpretation of the actors, Lucas plays a credible good simple boy, xcellent the interpretation of Gibson as well."

Could have done something better, I totally dig films about this kind of satanic stuff , don't even have to be a masterpiece for me to enjoy , f.i I found End of Days , The Prophecy , Stigmata highly enjoyable . But this is a total lack of time and a wasted effort. If the director thought for a second that adding up zombies , fallen angels. a group of guys isolated in a gas station in a Romero's style and tons of special effects he would came up with a good film\u0085sorry to say that he failed miserably."

Legion is not that movie.\n\nWhat a tremendous disappointment this movie was. As others have noted, the concept was fairly original and definitely held much promise. Unfortunately, the people in charge of bringing the concept to life were entirely incapable of doing so. There were so many problems with this movie it's hard to know where to begin.\n\nTo be fair, the acting wasn't bad. Nobody is taking home an Oscar, but the characters were somewhat believable, if not fully developed. I definitely had a hard time connecting with some of the characters, but that had more to do with the God-awful dialogue they were forced to recite. Whoever wrote this movie should do the world a favor and remove all pens, pencils, markers and anything else that could be used to put letters on a page from their reach forever.\n\nWhile the characters weren't saying things that were either completely unnecessary or just plain stupid, they were doing things that were completely unnecessary or just plain stupid. I understand that movies like this require the viewer to suspend disbelief in order to appreciate the story, however, it would seem that the writers and directors expect the viewer to suspend their abilities to think and reason as well.\n\nUltimately, this was a blown opportunity of epic proportions. The directors took a great story idea, decent acting, a substantial effects budget and turned it into an uninspired and totally forgettable waste of two hours."

Falling to earth, he loads up on artillery and heads to the desert to protect the unborn child of a waitress (Adrianne Palicki). Arriving, he finds her and others (Tyrese Gibson, Kate Walsh, Dennis Quaid) defending a diner from an angelic onslaught.\n\nWhile Legion's last-stand scenario isn't damnable, its lack of realization is. Using an archetypal list of characters, and loose interpretations of the bible, it creates a conflicted narrative that fails to engage.\n\nConversely, after a battle between heaven and earth, it's all-you-can-eat angel wing night at the pub.

So here's the rundown on the basic plot - a pregnant woman is going to give birth to mankind's last hope, but God has lost faith in mankind so he wants to kill all of us ... so he tries to have his angels kill the baby but Micheal (the archangel) does believe it is a good order so he defies God and protects the girl along with everyone else in the small diner that is under attack. That is the whole plot. The issues I take up with it though are the fact that nothing seems to line up correctly. Micheal explains that the possessions are actually by angels (but they seem far too sadistic and bloodthirsty to be heavenly creatures) and Micheal talks to Gabriel saying that he was always eager to please God ... Gabriel is a fallen angel though ... biblically. On top of that, the description on the back of the box talks about how a group must fight off an evil demonic legion and even the title itself \"Legion\" is not a reflection of anything. Legion is the general of Satan's army. I may be nitpicking - but when there are such glaring inaccuracies - other things like the gas station pump making a smaller explosion than the stove in the diner seem too minimal to pick at."

Maybe I'm alone in this, because other reviewers are singing his praises, but he was terrible in this film--the overly fake accent, the earnest good boy BUT I LOVE HER EVEN IF SHE IS A CHAIN-SMOKING WHORE spiels, multiple fatherly speeches from other male characters, and NO good action scenes. He was totally unnecessary in the film. The writers should have ditched Jeep and had Audrey take the place of that character, because apparently his most important roles were driving the damn car and almost getting killed by Gabriel.\n\nSpeaking of Gabriel, there's quite a bit of Kevin Durand hate going on, which surprised me because I actually liked his performance. No shitty accent, no monologues, just some good old fashioned Wrath o' God going down. I just wish the writers would have spent more time on the angelic badassery between Michael and Gabriel and less on the shitty people in the shitty diner."

(you know angels don't got self control right ?) after that we see a Police wants to kill people innocent people ... (which actually means Devil is controlling the whole world) and it goes on ...

But when the movie goes downhill, it proceeds to go down that hill until the credits. The action scenes were insanely boring and only few things kept my attention span. Around the hour mark, I started to continue my day otherwise than watch this trash of a movie. And then the baby? THE BABY? That made me turn it off and not suffer the last 10 minutes.

It's never gory or even scary, the only disgusting scene is when someone is hanging upside down on a cross and things go wrong with his body.

But now director Scott Stewart has discovered Bettany and cast in the leading role in Legion and Priest.\n\nAt Christmas time God has lost faith in mankind and plays to send a swarm of angels to exterminate all of mankind. The angels take over the weak to kill the strong. They main target is a pregnant waitress, Charlie (Adrianne Palicki) in the Mojave Desert: she is carrying the mankind's only hope. One angel comes to Earth to protect the baby, Michael (Bettany) and in a small caf\u00e9 with a group of non-affected people against the swarm.\n\nPaul Bettany does give his all in the film and tries to make Michael an interesting character. He is a character with a claim demeanour. Bettany had to act with a collection with a forest of actors and he still tried his best. He physically looks the part of a fallen angel. The only other actor who was decent was Kevin Durand as Gabriel, God's personal messenger and best warrior and I really like how he was given a heavenly sounding voice. It is an interesting idea of angels clashing amongst each other and Michael becomes a fallen angel, like Satan rebelling against God.\n\nThe religious story is obvious, a baby that is going to be the survivor of mankind is going to be born in the desert at Christmas time. There are ideas of the apocalypse/rapture of God turning on man and leaving humans with no hope. But Legion does not fulfil all this promise.\n\nLegion also take ideas from other films. One film it has often been compared to is the first two Terminator films, with a protector sent to save a mother and child from some powerful element. The way people turned into demonic angels was pretty much lifted from The Matrix when ordinary people turned into angels. The way the angels looked was like from a combination of horror films, from 28 Days Later, the remake of Dawn of the Dead, Zombieland and I Am Legend as well as the Futurekind from the third series of Doctor Who. The siege element was very much like a zombie film, like Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead (both versions) and when Michael has to battle his way through a lot of Angels it was like the scene in The Matrix when Neo raids a building and throws away different guns when he uses up the bullets. Also I thought the story reminded me a little of the Doctor Who episodes the Impossible Planet and The Satan Pit, where Satan takes control of an alien species and attacks a small group of humans in a space station. Those episodes were better then Legion.\n\nLegion is basically an exploitation film, but will intentions of being something smarter. It is set around a three action scenes involving the siege, a prologue scene and a final fight scene. It is violence and is almost like a Uwe Boll film with the use of children in the horror. It is done simply for shock value. There is early promise when Michael falls to Earth and he hacks off his wings. But Stewart does film some of the action scenes with almost no light and make its hard to see anything. The fight between Michael and Gabriel should have been epic but the lack of light ruined it.\n\nMany of the other characters in the film are simply stock characters and we do not get to know much about them. Stewart pretends to give them depth but it fails. We just do not care about them. It is fun to look at Willia Holland dressed in a short skirt and a low crop top but the film really does suffer when Bettany and Durand are not on screen.\n\n3.5/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film has attracted some really bad reviews but I decided to see for myself just what everyone was getting so het up about. Well, although it's not the best film in the world, it's far far better than many would have you believe. Yes, the premise is pretty preposterous, but I like the execution and I like the performances and so it turned out not as awful as I feared. I should say for the record that I'm not a religious man as so wasn't offended by the use of religious iconography in this film.\n\nA waitress, Charlie, who works in a diner on a deserted road in the Mojave Desert is heavily pregnant. She is looked after by Jeep Hanson and his father Bob, who owns the diner. It's a typical day with the usual comings and goings, but there's something in the air. And when a sweet old lady tells Charlie her baby is going to burn before going crazy and trying to kill everyone, they all know something is seriously wrong. Then a stranger arrives, he is heavily armed and ready for a fight. He calls himself Michael and claims he is a fallen angel. He has come to save Charlie's baby from the coming apocalypse as he is the only hope for mankind. More people arrive, but they are possessed and have only one thing on their minds. Many are killed but they are soon beaten back. Can this small band hold out until the baby comes, or will the possessed return to take the baby? A tough one I know, but I'm not going to tell you here.\n\nThe film is pretty well made with some nice special effects and some decent performances. It is let down by a rather weak story that could have been done with much more mystery than it was. Decent performances all round; Paul Bettany did a good job as Michael, although I felt he wasn't really stretched, although he did have some of the best dialogue. Lucas Black was OK as Jeep Hanson and it was nice to see Dennis Quaid as his father Bob. Tyrese Gibson was also good as the reformed bad guy Kyle Williams and Adrianne Palicki was OK, without being spectacular as Charlie. Finally a mention for Charles S. Dutton who did a good job as the chef, Percy Walker.\n\nIt very much put me in mind of the 1976 John Carpenter film, Assault on Precinct 13 with the quite claustrophobic feel of it. It's just a shame that the premise behind the storyline wasn't better thought out, or that the character of Michael didn't have more mystery about him. As I said at the beginning though, I think it was well produced and there were some decent performances. I know many won't agree, but I didn't dislike it all that much\u0085 I won't recommend it, but neither will I consign it to the reject pile, with this one I'll give you a free choice.\n\nMy Score: 5.2/10"

Regardless of my religious beliefs or any pretext surrounding Christianity, there's more reason to believe in God then there is to \"have faith\" in this atrocity. An angel has been sent to down to protect a diner full of people, including a pregnant woman, as he disagrees with God's plan to wipe out humanity. So he/she/it chooses to send angels to destroy humanity instead of flooding, nuking or imploding the world. He has lost faith that much, that he/she/it couldn't be bothered to do it themselves? Surely, suuuurely there are more methodical ways to kill us. Why has he/she/it lost faith in us anyway? Rise in terrorism? Overpopulation? Global warming? There was no reasoning for this catastrophic decision. And so, ultimately, the film makes no sense and holds no purpose. There are only three good scenes: crazy old woman climbing the ceiling and stating \"your baby will burn\", an elongated ice cream van driver and the fight between Michael and Gabriel. That's it. Nothing else is redeemable and worth your time. The acting, ohhhh the acting. Bettany must've had some religious epiphany or some weird experience, for he also starred in 'Priest' a year later, so I can only assume it was his mid-life crisis. He was fine. Everyone else? No. Black should be drifting in Tokyo. Gibson shouldn't be in films. Quaid doesn't even care. The rest of the cast were just B-list stars trying to give their all to a lacklustre screenplay which contains no character development whatsoever. These characters are lifeless. You don't care about their outcome, heck I wanted the angels to decimate the entire diner so the film could end. The fact it was all set in one location may seem inspired, but the horrific use of CGI (I mean seriously...) negated any \"genius\" environmental set pieces. Urgh, I'm done. So pick up your Bible, and throw it at the TV if this film is on. Amen."

When Percy talk to Kyle about Kyle's gun, you can hear some really nice words from Percy, about what his father was talking to him when he was young boy. Also, Michael's: \"You've done what He wanted, I've what He needed\" is great quote, too, and it should be directions in our relations with close friends and family. Other characters are good-shown. They are different, and all of them are good in they way, and bad in they way (like most of persons). Because of using religious theme, but nothing to do with it, my vote is 4."

During the film I frequently asked myself: Why do these bad films keep on being made? Why manufacture \"more of the same\"? OK, some women are very nice Willa Holland & Kate Walsh, probably even nicer. And there's the occasional line by a big actor that tries to deliver us from pain. In this case, Paul Bettany's. But saving this film is like trying the \"unsink\" the Titanic. Dennis Quaid should be banned from cinemas, like an alcoholic/ any drug user :).\n\nIf I had to get any \"redeeming qualities\", trying hard I'd get the modest \"philosophical\" dialogues when the willfully opposite characters speak out their conscience during guards, before \"the evil ones come up to get them\". And I did feel moderately scared at a couple of times, thou probably an expensive cinema's sub woofers helped a lot to fabricate this desired effect. But it was Amazon reviewer Paul Gaita who really gave me the creeps when he wrote that there may be a sequel coming...\n\nMy favourite character would be Doug Jones. His wicked ice cream vendor is scary, thou we all know it's just the juxtaposition of \"something really good, associated to childhood and its easy pleasures\" and well, \"violent hungry dead people at night\" or whichever crap that stuffs our nightmares. Charles S. Dutton's down to earthiness was also refreshing, pity his character is dealt with so simply. I liked the trite but effective \"father's words of wisdom\". Yes, it's been said before, and way better, but \"Carpe diem\" is never completely put to practice in our lives, right? Adrianne Palicki is nice in the IMDb pictures, but not on the film, which proves how bad cinematography is. Corny, dark in a bad sense, trivial.\n\nAvoid at all costs, unless you want to have some cheap fun.\n\nPS: If you insist on enduring it, get some beer and an XL popcorn, for this film really sucks. In a world where you can watch a Pasolini film, hear anything of Bach or watch a De Chirico painting. this kind of films..."

Then they try to build up the drama and develop the characters, but you just don't care enough to follow. Acting is average, dialogs are average, the story is...well average. Everything is just average.\n\nAlso, since when can demons be killed with normal bullets? What's the point of being a demon if you can get killed so easily -_-'? And I hate movies that randomly pick some baby to be the Savior of man kind. What makes that baby so special? Nothing at all, maybe that would have been the one and single only character development they should have focused on.\n\nThen there's the pace of the movie. You get 20 minutes of action, 50 minutes of boredom and 20 minutes of nonsense.\n\nThe only good thing in Legion were the effects which aren't too bad. Other than that, there's really no reason to like this movie.\n\nAnyway, avoid Legion, don't buy it on DVD, don't rent it and for gods sake, do not pay a cinema ticket to see it."

Editing errors created non sequitur shots without reference points. (Unfortunately, the unreferenced shots were the only intriguing moments in the film.) This movie couldn't decide if it wanted to be a drama, a horror movie, or a religious allegory, but the script was too weak to support any choice very well.

The theme is not new. The Christopher Walken trilogy pretty much sets the bar for this sort of story. And HEAVEN KNOWS our relationship with our Creator is complicated -- an episode of Touched by An Angel comes to mind, where a town decides to sue God in court, and Monica has to appear to defend --- but (to repeat the point of the review) Bettany soars (as if he had wings?) over the heads of the other actors, many of whom appear lost or miscast, (Lucas Black as an adult never rediscovered the niche he had enjoyed as a child actor), and it is his performance alone which makes this entertaining and worth watching. Plus, the creepy possessed people scenes -- few as they are are -- are SERIOUSLY creepy,"

Personally I would class it as a cross between the Prophecy films (without Christopher Walken hamming it up!), and something like 'The Crazies'.\n\nI actually found the character development just fine, and I enjoyed the slower pace which reflects movies such as Carriers and The Crazies rather than Quantum of Solace which seemed hyperactive and crude by comparison.\n\nI thought there was a good undercurrent of humor throughout and the actors were top notch. Everyone comments on the special effects and a certain fight scene but I felt that by far the best thing about this film was the feeling of indecision and uncertainty which lent it a far greater realness than endless testosterone fueled 'action stars'. Great stuff!"

Firstly, the cast is pretty decent, the plot is granted formulaic, there's suspense coupled with the biblical supernatural which allows the film to move along at a pretty good pace. There's some pithy one liners that I can guarantee you'll repeat at some point. It ain't Hamlet but just pure escapism and should be reviewed and watched with this at the forefront of the viewers mind. I've seen reviews that pick apart minor details about plot errors or biblical inaccuracies which if that is to the extent you've sat down to watch this movie then I can only assume you're after perfection, which sadly doesn't exist. Sit back and just enjoy it for what it is."

        "review_detailed_main": "In this film we are looking at the usual end of the world setting. But even then its always interesting to see what happens next.\n\nFrom the previews seen from Legion we've already learned that its about God giving up on man and He sends angels to destroy man. So now an angel that does not believe in God's orders goes out to save mankind by protecting a woman who's baby is the only hope mankind has of surviving. The story is very interesting and the cast is perfect for this movie. Before the movie is over it leaves us on a little cliffhanger. Its hard to tell if the \"extermination\" is over or not. But still the battle of Gabriel and Michael is pretty good. Some of the things that happened are definitely leading up to something big.\n\nSo is this the next big action-apocalypse of the decade probably not. But still a pretty good action film that not all but a lot of movie goers will enjoy. Me on the other hand I'm looking forward to a sequel and the upcoming developments to see that will definitely be enjoyable."

        "review_detailed_main": "While gathered at a remote truck-stop diner, a small group of inhabitants finds that the mysterious stranger who arrives is an Angel of Heaven looking to keep a pregnant member of the group alive as God sends forth an army to wipe them out as part of his Armageddon plans.\n\nOverall this one was quite an enjoyable effort. The biggest factor for this one is the fact that this one really lets loose with lots of great action throughout here, giving this one so much to really like here from the numerous encounters. There's tons of bloodshed and some creepy moments here and there from scenes like the first shootout from the armory with the turned policemen, the diners' encounter with the old woman who begins flying around the ceiling attempting to get at them in the middle of a huge gunfight and the blazing firefight on the top of the establishment with the endless stream of possessed coming along in cars leading to the flaming crashes and burning bodies left behind as the gunfights take out dozens more in fine fashion. The other ambushes on the patrons inside the diner are quite fun as they attempt to break in and get at them forcing some thrilling action to barricade them off which makes the whole segment quite fun along with the later attacks here with the trap involving the family coming to the gas pump and setting off the trap which is quite a blast overall here. The big final assault here makes for quite a big spectacle here as the initial charge on the building and the pre-natal conflict to keep the baby alive in the midst of a furious hand-to-hand battle between the supernaturally-powered aggressors throwing each other around the diner and brawling with intensity and fervor that matches the brutality of what's coming on. The spiritual context of the fight helps to give this a stronger sense of fantasy and spectacle than otherwise expected, which gives this one a great visual sense to go along with the engaging story which gives this another piece of the strong plot. As well, the fact that there's a lot to like with its make-up work on the possessed deformities and the strong, bloody gore all work together with these factors here to make this a rather enjoyable effort. There's not a whole lot really wrong here, as there's really only one main problem here as there's some truly bad and obvious CGI found here. The transitions from the possessed as they begin jumping and flying around in really ludicrous manners that are tacky and stand-out in the diner attacks and the finale which are the most obvious and distracting parts. Otherwise, there wasn't a lot of other flaws here.\n\nRated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, violence-against- children, drug use and strong religious themes."

If you are a regular reader of the bible and of bible prophesy then this is a must have movie. I was able to purchase the Legion Blu Ray DVD for only fifteen dollars on sale at Best Buy in Portland Oregon 97266. Legion is worth every penny with the outstanding state of the art special effects including the great battle scene between the arch angel Michael and the avenging angel Gabriel. Outstanding it does not get any better. The audio effects are first rate and definitely state of the art. Disregard the negative critical reviews as they are no doubt written by individuals who prefer the BLOB."

Also, the fact that Jesus is part of the Trinity (he IS GOD) the idea that \"God\" would want to stop Jesus' second mission is absurd. They are ONE GOD, one being in 3 persons. (Much how a wave is part of the ocean...or although it's not totally accurate, an apple has, the fruit, the skin, and the core...except God isn't \"split\" into 3 ...it's too complicated for this review, but Jesus is God, as is the Holy Spirit, as is The Father) so if you can suspend what you know of the Bible and treat this as much of a religious movie as Terminator is a science movie ...you'll be just fine!!\n\nHis name evades me, but the man who plays the \"ice cream man\"...he is an AMAZING actor who is known for being able to do creepy things with his body, and he's a highlight.\n\nGive it a try, it's not trying to be biblical!!!!"

Quaid isn't on his best form but he still delivers an entertaining performance. The rest of the cast fill their roles equally well, and Kevin Durrands Gabriel is an unexpected stand out role.\n\nThis is a film best enjoyed from your couch with the lights down, popcorn in hand and your other half at your side.\n\nI'm glad this film made its way to Netflix.

A very interesting and original idea for a horror movie (and no, there are no DETAILED explanations as to why angels turn against humanity and why the baby was the saviour - but who cares? Perhaps this is a suggestion for a sequel?). The suspense was created and built up in a great way. Oh and Willa Holland looks absolutely beautiful in this. An icing on top of a cake. If anyone is reading these reviews whilst thinking whether to watch the movie or not - watch it. Even if like the other critics on here for some reason you won't like it (for example, in one scene a pen is at the wrong angle or something else extremely offensive), it i still worth a go.

Of course some things don't match to any biblical sense, as for one, Angels are not sent to kill someone, they don't have sharp teeth, nor do they have black eyes. Angels do server purposes to fulfill Gods true purpose of protecting humans and serving them, as we are His children. This is somewhat of a scary movie, more or less just weird, yet, it gets the adrenaline pumping and rushing on the fight scenes. Even though, I wouldn't believe that Arch-angels would fight each other, its not in their nature to do such thing."

        "review_detailed_main": "this is only the second IMDb review I've written, but I feel I need to defend this movie! yes, there are plot holes wide enough to drive an ice-cream truck through, and yes, it rips off \"The Terminator\" and \"Constantine\" and probably other movies...but there's something about it that keeps me glued to the TV set anytime it's on cable.\n\nfor one thing, it's got a really nice desert vibe (which also explains why I love the dreadful \"Route 666\"). for another thing, it's unusual that a horror movie can make you care about the characters, but this one does. the parents and their troubled teenage daughter...the man in love with a woman who doesn't love him back...the gas station owner who's been a failure at everything his whole life...the hip-hop dude locked in a custody battle for his son....I found myself hoping things would work out for them all.\n\nthe cast was excellent too; the girl who plays Audrey was particularly wonderful. you don't expect a lot of character growth in a movie like this, so I was impressed.\n\nI'm a sucker for God-sends-his-angels-to-earth movies, even if I did wonder why angels had to rely so much on automatic weapons and locked doors instead of some sort of heavenly assistance.\n\nif you're looking for a movie with a few genuinely scary jump-out-of-your-seat moments and are willing to overlook some silliness of plot points, you'll enjoy \"Legion.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm pretty sure I watched this years ago but when I scrolled across it in Netflix, it didn't look familiar. I'm glad I dialed it up.\n\nIt's kind of a judgement day story that doesn't get bogged down with too much religion. I typically like movies with some religious underpinning while not being overtly religious.\n\nThe story keeps good pace, only slowing to develop some relationships and the smallest of backstory.\n\nPaul Bettany is his usual awesome self and Adrianne Palicki is very good as well. The rest of the cast does a good job too. If I were to be picky, Quaid and Walsh maybe push the unnecessary edges of their characters, but they don't go over the top\n\nThe resolution of the movie is good enough but has me thinking a sequel could tell an interesting second chapter."

The old lady turning into a deon and crawling across the ceiling had many in the audience gasping.\n\nAfter seeing the low rating on IMDB and reading some of the bad reviews I almost skipped this movie to move on to something else. I'm glad I risked wasting an hour and 40 minutes of my life to see it. I was very entertained and I would recommend it for anyone that hasn't seen it.\n\nThe special effects were well done. The storyline was interesting. I thought the acting was better than a lot of films I've watched. Overall it was an 8 for me."

        "review_detailed_main": "I cannot understand why this film is dismissed by both the critics and the public. I have watched it several times and think it is one of the best films of 2010. The cast is excellent and there is real chemistry among the characters. The location is in the beautiful New Mexican desert. And the plot has just the right amount of action and character development. It is the rare type of film that as I watch it again I see new things in it each time. However I suppose you have to like Zombie films. But as for the hate this film gets. It is totally irrational. I can only guess that people who don't like this film are either put off by the religious themes or just hate zombie films. Perhaps there has been an organized effort from Christian groups to down-vote this great film. Anyway I give it an easy 8/10. I hope they make a sequel."

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't watch movies for stylistic elements or the scene-by-scene, I watch them for the story and the action. This movie has a very compelling story, and some great action. I also liked the line about God being sick of mankind's BS.\n\nSeeing as it's part one of what is supposed to be a trilogy, I don't expect the entire story to flesh itself out, but I want to be hooked. I find the idea of the protector, the (as yet unseen) prophets, rune tattoos, and the child not-meant-to-be suitable to the task. The ending has received some complaints, but, such is always the case with trilogies: some people just don't realize how trilogies get made; you leave the viewer wanting more. If the ending were satisfying, then there would be no point to continue the story. I'd love to see the next movies get produced and the story flesh itself out. Done right, the next movies could be better than the first. Especially if they make the lore as interesting at it promises to be."

If you look at the cast they are a list and it's a great plot. I still have to keep talking. Umm. Bethany is very good as are all the secondary characters. Great to see Dennis quail in this. I'm 251 characters short. So it's like a zombie apocalypse in a diner. The granny who turned into a killer freaked me out. Thingy from lost them turns up as the main baddie. He's great but I assume he specialises in playing evil baddies. I think I've got the numbers to post :)"
