        "review_detailed_main": "No one was expecting a remake of Black Christmas, nor was anyone asking for it, so its announcement in June felt sudden. What kind of interest can there be in the cult proto-slasher of 1974? Especially after the notorious 2006 remake, which many still either recall as a nightmare or consider it an unintentional comedy because of its torture porn elements, plot holes, and ridiculous killers. However...\n\nThe rights to the concept were bought by Blumhouse with director Sophia Takal and screenwriter April Wolfe to helm the newest incarnation. Takal had previously shot some lazy indie thriller about mean-spirited female friendship and a full-length episode of the anthology series Into the Dark... also about mean-spirited female friendship. And with New Year's entourage. Perhaps, everything starts there. The two saw the opportunity to depict all of their modern ideas, only with some snow and toothless screamers.\n\nDon't try to find any tributes to the original besides a gender-swapped sorority house cat (in 1974, we had Claude, now we have Claudette) and an attempt to strangle one of the villains with polyethylene. Instead, there's a group of stereotypical modern college girls, one of whom, Riley (Imogen Poots), suffers from emotional trauma after being raped by one of the frat bros (Ryan McIntire), who escaped the punishment and even dared to return to the college grounds. But the girls have worse problems: the most obnoxious student, Chris (Aleyse Shannon), demands the dismissal of one of the old-school professors for his boomer-ish way of teaching. While Professor Gelson (Cary Elwes) is trolling the Twitter suffragists by quoting Camille Paglia, female students begin to disappear. At first, nobody cares about the off-key acting blonde girl from literally every trailer and promo (Lucy Curry), but the further disappearances begin to slowly alarm. The campus police shrugs and isn't eager to do anything (another clumsy curtsy to the original), so Riley begins her own investigation.\n\nWith the subtlety of a jackhammer, Takal and Wolfe eagerly expose the cult of toxic masculinity, and every man is either evil or stupid. Armored with the tenets of Judith Butler, Gloria Steinem and many other founding mothers of women's studies, the duo weaponizes their liberal arts degrees but quickly finds itself cornered by their own ambition, unable to materialize timely messages, so they resort to supernatural gimmicks, where \"toxicity\" becomes literal. No Billy, no Agnes, no real freedom from male opinion. Somewhere in 1974, Jess Bradford sighs heavily while firmly announcing to her boyfriend the decision to have an abortion. Turns out that women's rights aren't about freedom of choice, but about driving away the \"white men science\" from universities.\n\nBlack Christmas doesn't want to be a horror movie. In fact, it doesn't want to be a film. But it wants to be an essay, wrapped in Christmas lights in a hypocritical attempt to capitalize on a familiar title. An essay, albeit with a budget of $5KK, is not capable of being exciting and thrilling. Even in others negative reviews, only Imogen Poots is rightfully praised, but she is underutilized by the writers, who didn't care to give her character a decent development. Cary Elves wasn't told this isn't another Saw movie, and something like \"game over\" is always about to burst from his perpetually menacing grin.\n\nThe film is mostly praised for showing certain socially disturbing topics familiar to many upper-middle class millenials. Campus abuse and rape culture were highlighted in The Hunting Ground, and the pointless gory gender violence was shown in epic Assassination Nation. What do we get in Black Christmas? The fear of walking down the street alone at night, the keys clutched in a shaking fist, and the annoyance with \"not all men\".\n\nBlack Christmas is a boring, bloodless, cheap-looking thriller that dramatically lacks appreciation for the genre, opting instead to radicalize the audience without a single care for the horror fans. Unlike the first two films, this one won't be fondly remembered in decades to come. A famous Russian actress Faina Ranevskaya is quoted as saying, \"Making a bad movie is like spitting in the eternity.\" That's exactly what Takal and Wolfe did."

The characters were exceptionally bad and unlikable and had no depth. The scares were clich\u00e9 and very unoriginal. It's a total introvert to the 1974 cult classic. The original actually had suspense, a creepy atmosphere, scary scenes, and an effective direction. This one had none of those things... I'm very surprised because Blumhouse usually makes quality films, from my experience. Very disappointed.\n\nDO NOT ruin your holidays and see Black Christmas! The original is great, but not this one!"

The direction and cinematography is dull and uninspired, and the film feels completely lifeless as a result, lacking in any mood and suspense almost entirely, and substituting with way too many cheap jump scares.\n\nThe script is just as awkward, with unbelievably cringeworthy dialogue, unlikeable characters, with them making too many questionable decisions, and frankly, it asks a little too much for suspension of disbelief.\n\nAs a remake, it misses the mark horrendously. As a horror film, it leaves a lot to be desired. It's both a bad film, and an incredibly boring one."

A little heavy-handed at times, but be honest with yourself - first-wave slashers like the original weren't exactly bastions of subtlety. It's got a nice colour palette, well-staged shots, and some clever if pulpy plot devices. Characters range from sympathetic to one-note, which is probably better than most college-kid-horror films.\n\nWhat is probably most striking about the film is the reaction it's solicited from audiences. For many of the negative reviews read as though they were written by the villains of the film itself. Something to think about, hmm?"

        "review_title": "Completely inept feminist claptrap",
        "review_detailed_main": "The original Black Christmas is a cult favorite, if only because of Olivia Hussey and the little well-known anecdote that it inspired John Carpenter to write Halloween. Sadly, since the 70's the \"teen slasher\" genre has been done to death (no pun intended), and whilst films like You're Next and Happy Death Day attempt to breathe life into a stale formula, we haven't really seen a great slasher film this side of the noughties.\n\nThis brings us to 2019 and the latest Black Christmas remake, which desperately wants you to take notice of its existence. It wants you to know that it's sincere, and hip and \"cool\" because it taps into the feminist movement. The first remake of Black Christmas was torn apart by critics in 2006 for its gratuitous violence and paper-thin female characters. The latest remake, helmed by Sophia Takal (who also contributed to the screenplay) fixes that by giving the female characters empowerment and an agenda. Think Charlies Angels with a bit of When a Stranger Calls and half a dozen fairy lights thrown into a slop bucket and you sort of get the idea. I am all for strong female characters. Laurie Rhodes from the aforementioned Halloween and Ripley from Alien are just two classic examples of empowered female leads in a horror franchise. Both of these characters are constantly one step ahead of the (usually male) antagonist and it reminds us that female characters are not only equal to their counterparts, but they often become a force to be reckoned with.\n\nBlack Christmas (2019) spends so much time telling us that the female characters are awesome that it forgets to develop any of their actual character. Most of the female characters might as well be referred to as \"Girl 1\" and \"Girl 2\" because their sole reason for being on screen is to be quickly bumped off in festive fashion. In a film that is clearly influenced heavily by the MeToo movement, to have such weak characters is detrimental to the whole saccharine message the film wants to convey.The male characters, most of whom are Fraternity Jocks are presented as either creepy, misogynistic or both. This film wants us to root for the female characters by forcing us to swallow the idea that the male characters are all wicked and degrading jerks. There is even a jolly festive song about sexual assault thrown in for good measure. This all makes no sense when a film about empowerment of the gender resorts to doing the very thing it is supposedly criticizing to get its point across.\n\nOf the film itself, Black Christmas (2019) is decidedly dull. The original was a creepy little penny-dreadful type chiller. The remake was gratuitous fluff but it at least gave gore-hounds something to lap up. This one is both bloodless (physically and metaphorically) and is about as scary as a Christmas candy cane. The script feels like something out of a high school amateur production and most of the cast overact and chew the scenery. To achieve a PG-13 rating the violence was toned down so much that this feels like something off The Haunting Hour. All of the kills are off screen and so much time is spent with long and drawn out conversations between the female leads that even the short running time seems to drag on, and on and on. The film takes itself far too seriously, but then pulls the rug from under our feet right at the end when the \"twist\" is revealed. I won't spoil what happens, but the supernatural element that they tacked on did not make any sense and just made the whole thing even more ridiculous.\n\nWatch the original. Heck, even go back to the 2006 remake, but skip this turkey."

Personally, I don't have to \"agree\" with every movie I see in order to enjoy/appreciate it for escape and entertainment's sake, and I am hard to offend but get that nowadays many get off on being constantly offended (not pointing fingers to specific individuals, just generally speaking, tho I get the feeling that those who couldn't handle the female Ghostbusters or Charlie's Angels (2019) or this Black Christmas and just enjoy an entertaining movie for entertainment's sake because they get their political feelings/feathers ruffled easily prob won't like this film).\n\nBut YES, I LOVED and appreciated it for its originality, for being DiFFERENT and for its effort in being contemporary and relatable to a modern audience and for NOT just being cookie-cutter with its approach as a slasher.\n\nHALLOWEEN (2018) could've been more original and less cookie-cutter than it's predecessors in my opinion (we've seen them all before and, its throwbacks to the originals and its approach to the script are carbon-copy ripoffs of what \"Scream 4\" already did in the name of originality in back in 2011 with \"Scream\" (1996)) and, \"Black Christmas\" (2019) took some great risks that ultimately didn't pay off with the mainstream audiences but, like I said, I can appreciate that it sticks with its guns and brought originality and relatability instead of regurgitating what's already been done a million times - and YES, entertaining regardless in my opinion, but can respect that we all have our own tastes.\n\nI def think it was unnecessarily hated and if you are an open-minded person who can appreciate originality it's at least worth a view in my opinion."

Even the remake, which I re-watched a few years back was mildly entertaining. So I thought, another update while wildly unnecessary, would still be a good watch. Boy, was I wrong. This film is so boring and all around terrible that is very much so the worst movie I've seen in 2019.\n\nThe film is about a group of sorority sisters who want to bond over the holidays and also spend time to uncover the men in a local frat who have committed crimes against them. However, it turns out members of the sorority start getting murdered right after receiving texts from someone impersonating the controversial founder of the college that they attend. This film stars Imogen Poots, Cary Elwes, and a bunch of terrible actors no one cares about.\n\nNot only is this film mind numbingly boring for an hour, its overbearing theme of modern feminist and touching on modern women v men issues completely takes away from anything the film wants to build up. It was so off putting, the dialogue ludicrously bad. I feel like this script was written by a high school student who likes to go to parties, and goes on Twitter to glaze over whatever people are outraged about.The acting is no good, although Poots tried her very best. The scares are so predictable, there's no interest in who the killer is because I was so far removed from interested.\n\nYou can make a good film that is strong on feminsm without being so on the nose about it! These characters are all so shallow and blend into one another.Also, the plot gets so horrendously bad as it goes along holy cow. People at the cinema were audibly annoyed with the ridiculous writing. This is certainly the worst film I've seen all year and makes it predecessors look like absolute classics. Do yourself a favor, and don't make the mistake of seeing this crap.\n\n2/10"

All we did was laugh during the whole movie because the scares were nonexistent, the characters were basic chicks and the plot was messy and dumb. Dont waste your time with this movie if you want to have someone tell at you about being scared of men when really it's even between men and women. This director needs to stay away from anymore horror movies because it's clear she didnt do enough research for this movie and its main plot. Dont watch it or you'll seriously regret it!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Bob Clark's underrated 1974 masterpiece, Black Christmas, was a shining example of how to make a horror movie with a deep message attached to it. Sophia Takal's remake is a political message with a terrible horror movie attached to it.\n\nThis is a film with the subtlety of a man being run over by a pink Greyhound bus. Characters in this film talk entirely in buzzwords and taglines, and if you make the mistake of going to see this then you better get used to it, because the filmmakers were far more concerned with getting their agenda across than making a horror movie. Large chunks of time pass where it feels like the film is far too focused on beating the audience over the head with its message that it forgets to be scary, and once it actually tries, it falls flat on its face. Of course, it doesn't help that this movie clearly got axed hard in the editing room to get a PG-13 rating, leaving very minimal onscreen bloodshed to make the final cut. The plot is also so wildly different from the original (a simple look at the trailer gives that away) that aside from a wink or two here and there, this really is just a remake in name alone. For that, the 2006 remake of Black Christmas at least deserves a touch of credit in retrospect for trying to show some respect for the source material. Sure, it's still a very flawed film in its own right, but at least it actually resembled a film.\n\nImogen Poots and Cary Elwes are the only reasons why I'm even giving this a 2/10 instead of 1, because bless their hearts, they were trying."

        "review_detailed_main": "Is Black Christmas (2019) a perfect film? No. But is it the atrocious mess that people who haven't even seen it are claiming? No, not at all.\n\nThe truth is that Black Christmas is a very topical film that was clearly made by women, for women. And there's nothing wrong with that. Yes, in a few parts the social commentary felt a bit heavy handed. But guess what? The original Black Christmas also contains content regarding women being women that shocked audiences at the time with its frank, in your face nature.\n\nThis modern reimagining of Black Christmas has many nods to the original while still telling an original story. There's much social commentary to uncover about toxic masculinity, women sticking together instead of tearing each other down, etc.\n\nIt starts a bit slow, but the tension increases around the halfway point. Once the killer gets into the house, the movie kicks into high gear.\n\nI saw this in a packed theater with people of all ages, genders, and ethnicities. What I observed was that most of the men looked uncomfortable several times. Meanwhile, most of the women were so into this revenge fantasy that they cheered numerous times.\n\nOverall, the audience was engaged. People screamed. People laughed. People shouted at the characters. Many, many viewers walked out humming, whistling, or singing the movie's catchy rendition of a classic Christmas song.\n\nThose who feel threatened by a movie for calling out rape culture need to take a good long look at why they're upset. Those who've been hating on this movie just for being rated PG-13 are showcasing a completely disingenuous take on the genre as a whole. There have been many beloved horror films that were rated PG-13.\n\nYes, a few scenes were cut short to get a PG-13 rating. But the movie is still ultimately satisfying and a lot of fun. And those who demand an R-rated film will almost certainly get the original cut when the movie comes out on DVD.\n\nPurists who are mad that this isn't a direct remake of the original need to give themselves permission to view this movie on its own merits. It doesn't mess up the original in any way. It's just a fun, topical take on the general subject matter that's a great fit for women who have embraced the Me Too movement."

ZERO. actually negative since i was laughing at most of the scenes intended to scare me. dialogue? trash. acting? awful except imogen poots. the story??? OH EM JEE. couldn't believe it. the action-y parts? a joke, couldn't see anything. the.... character decisions............................. bro, among worst of all time.\n\nthe dumbness rating of this movie is infinity. i really can't believe someone wrote this stuff and thought it would be good. it was never intriguing or suspenseful. not even a droplet. it is complete and utter garbage.\n\ni rate it an 8 out of 10 on the hilariocity scale #stucky (1 viewing, 4/29/2020)"

Its really nothing new especially if you've seen the tv show Buffy the Vampire Slayer which this actually feels like an extended episode of. And I say that with admiration because that's my favorite show. As the film goes on the \"woke\" gets to be a touch too much towards the finale but it is entertaining and the points that are made in this genre themed battle of the sexes is really quite intriguing. The kills happen mostly off screen and because the killers are quite menacing some pay off gore would have been appreciated with an R rating. That being said I appreciated all the clever bits to the exorcist 3 homage to the rakes on mistletoe and women rougeing their cheeks. It all leads up to a girl power finale that's cheer worthy. In the end it's a refreshing take on expected material that deserves way more of the right attention than it's been getting.\n\nBudget: $5m Domestic Box Office: $10m Worldwide Box Office: $19m\n\n3.75/5"

If you're looking for Billy or phone calls from the moaner, you will be disappointed. I think you have to go into this knowing it's its own movie and not part of Bob Clark's \"Black Christmas\" storyline. As stated in many reviews, it is pretty heavy-handed with its messaging. The messaging itself is fine and good. Personally, I prefer subtlety over an in-your-face approach. For instance, I love when actors can convey so much with a look and not require dialog to tell the audience what he/she is thinking. There is no doubt the filmmakers were going to make sure everyone understood the purpose of this film. Even at the end of the movie when the explanation is given for what's going on, I would assume most audience members already had it figured out, so, again, we didn't need a drawn-out explanation for the proceedings. All that said, I thought the first 70 minutes of the film were great. Although predictable and heavy-handed with the message, I liked the lead characters and cared about them. I thought the actors did a great job, and the movie went along at a nice pace. All the scares have been seen multiple times before, so there wasn't anything scary in the action. The final 20 minutes, after the lead figures out what's going on, is a let-down. I understand its inclusion and drives home the point they are trying to make, but I thought it was a little too much, having me wonder if the filmmakers think I'm too dumb to figure this out. If they wanted something scary, I think they would've needed to keep everything at a human level. Anyway, overall, I thought the film had a great beginning and progression, but the payoff was lacking with a message too in-your-face where a little subtlety could've made for a better viewing experience."

But someone thought of bringing in a supernatural twist, unfortunately one of the most farfetched, ridiculous and childish kind that I've ever seen! Add to this the facts that all killings take place outside the camera, that main character Riley is an unattractive and self-righteous goody-two-shoes and with that extremely annoying, and that there isn't one tiny drop of humor to be found in the whole movie!\n\nAll this makes for a rather tedious 90 minutes. Even made harder (if possible) by this dark (not shown, only talked about) background for the Riley-chracter, having apparently been raped recently and then having faced disbelief by everyone around her. This fact plays a pivotal role in the story and even results in some sort of demonstrative feminist misandry by all the sorority-sisters, as opposed to the blatant misogyny of the guys in the enemy fraternity. In such a flimsy and ridiculous movie as this, this all feels rather contrived, uncalled for and pointless."

        "review_detailed_main": "This version of \"Black Christmas\" is the third film with the same name and same BASIC plot. The first came out in 1994, another in 2006 and now this one. However, I really am not sure how much this new film is a remake...it's more a massive reworking of the old plots. So, instead of a mindless film with lot of females being killed, this time it's a lot of politically correct feminist women being killed. And, I honestly think this strong woke feminist theme in the movie is why the film is now on the infamous IMDB Bottom 100 List.\n\nThis infamous list SHOULD represent movies which are horribly made...films which are amateurish, with horrid acting and inept direction. Films like \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\", \"Robot Monster\", \"Birdemic\" and \"The Room\" easily fit this bill. Oddly, the only one of these four that DID make the list is \"The Room\".\n\nInstead, many of the films on the list simply made it there because they were featured on \"MSTK3000\" or have an offensive and irritating message or irritating people (such as Paris Hilton). Some films clearly deserve inclusion for this reason...such as the \"Human Centipede\" films..which feature some bad acting but mostly are gross murder porn films with no socially redeeming values. But many don't deserve the inclusion and a worst of list should NOT be because you disagree with the philosophy or politics of a film or hate an actor or actress....and I think this is exactly why the 2019 version of \"Black Christmas\" made the list.\n\nBecause \"Black Christmas\" is on the Bottom 100, I initially assumed it would technically be a mess and I was ready to hate it. It wasn't and I didn't. The cinematography was actually exceptional...with a moving camera that WASN'T the god-awful 'shaky cam' but which made it look as if the camera was organic...a part of the scenery. It was lovely and showed a lot of skill. The acting also was pretty good...and the direction was also very good.\n\nNow I am NOT saying it's a great film. Much of it does seem heavy-handed and the feminist message hits you over the head like a sledgehammer. But does this mean the film should be flooded with 1 votes as well as one to two sentence reviews that say, essentially, that 'it sucked'?! Of course not...this is slamming a film because you don't like the message or messenger. This would be like me giving 1s to all the films of a few actors simply because they are people I don't like. Too many, apparently, hated the heavy-handed feminist message of \"Black Christmas\" and decided, en masse, to attack the movie. As I said, technically, the film IS well made.,,but I've seen such attacks before on IMDB. Chances are, as a result of my review, I'll receive 1001 'not helpfuls'.\n\nSo apart from being technically well made, I do agree that the writing certainly could be better. Most viewers simply go to movies to be entertained...and this is especially true of the slasher films which are notorious for being rather mindless. So I could imagine MANY folks going to the theaters to see a Freddy Kruger or Jason sort of film being mad because they felt they didn't get what they expected. For some, this could be a positive selling point...but for many they probably just wanted to see mindless violence. Or, they wanted to see a real remake of \"Black Christmas\". For me, none of this is something I particularly want....I hate mindless violence and preachy plots and non-remakes. I just saw the film because of the controversy about it and because, oddly, I try to see all the Bottom 100 I can (95 and counting as of today!).\n\nI also occasionally hated the writing because some scenes didn't make a lot of sense. A great example is the initial killing, as an icicle is plunged through a woman's rib cage...which is impossible, as the icicle would simply shatter since the rib cage is so much stronger and harder than a piece of ice. I think the only way this MIGHT happen is if an icicle is shot at a person at several hundred miles per hour....and even then, I am doubtful. Or, if it's inserted between the ribs. Additionally, the whole 'Satanic-like possession' and black blood angle in the film also was dumb...and actually diluted the feminist message of the film and was also just silly. Apparently such Satanic-like plot devices are common in the genre...but it really worked poorly here.\n\nThe bottom line is that this film isn't great and has some problems but is certainly NOT worthy of the dubious distinction of inclusion on the IMDB list."

First of all, absolutely NO relation to the original. Zero. Zilch. Why even bother calling it Black Christmas? What it was, was . . . a poorly done version of a Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode? You know the one I'm talking about. The one about the frat house. It was that. Only without the talent of Joss Whedon involved. Truly, utterly without merit. They say no one sets out to make a bad movie, but whoever greenlit this should be ashamed of themselves. I would almost say OFFENSIVELY bad. Felt bad for Cary Elwes having to appear in this piece of crap. Bob Clark is rolling over in his grave. This makes the (pretty mediocre) 2006 remake look like Citizen Kane by comparison. WHAT on EARTH were these people thinking? Who the hell is the audience for this thing. Bad. Bad. BAD!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay, I can understand there are tons of bad reviews about this movie. Let's hear what I think about this movie. I have a theory that there are a lot of subtle tropes hidden in this movie. The villain never goes out of style in any year, decade, century, or millennium. So, of course, we all love slasher movies, but it doesn't mean every movie has similar methods or plots. I can see there is an art of war with black magic, which feels like medieval times mixed with modern times, and it borrows some visual methods, like the lack of action, which was a thing in Black Christmas (1974). I can also see another hidden trope: the betrayer. One of the girls is the betrayer, which feels like an evil queen during the art of war, medieval times mixed with the modern slasher in 2019. The art of war during medieval times mixed with slashers in modern times is very 2019. We're in 2025 now. So maybe there are three genres: horror (slasher), wartime, and dramatic with social norms. Social culture always changes every decade. I enjoyed this movie because of the camera angles too. It looks like it got mixed between 1974 and 2019-very dramatic perspectives if you look carefully. The ambiance, the art of time, the way every victim met their demise during those camera angles, and the medieval methods in modern times-very 2019! Of course, time always changes through every decade. Black Christmas (1974) was the first modern slasher with one genre: horror. Of course, the original always has its own way of inspiring new ideas with new improvement methods for later times. Black Christmas (2006) was heavily gory with a vibrant ambiance and very creative camera angles, combining two genres: action mixed with horror. Action was very popular in 2000s. Drama was very popular in 2010s. I enjoyed all three movies; 1974, 2006, and 2019."

        "review_detailed_main": "This would have been better served with an original title instead of having to live up to a classic. It would receive far less vitriol if it weren't associated with the original. Studios just can't let the siren song of tying things to previously successful properties just for name recognition go, and it does this film a disservice. The target audience for this film doesn't even know Black Christmas 1974 existed. The audience that does is not going to react well to this ones message as seen all over social media and these reviews.\n\nThe cutdown to PG13 is really felt while watching. The cuts are too abrupt during the kills and take you out of it. What would have been a pretty amusing retort in the climax was just left hanging as a \"suck my (total silence)\", that was a dud. You couldn't have the actress come in and dub over the word *ss if the assumed cl*t was too much for PG13?? I think they censored themselves too much fearing combined with the rape themes the MPAA would still give them an R??\n\nYes the message was heavy handed but it's the horror genre your allowed to be over the top.\n\nImogen was amazing as usual some of the other characters didn't really have time to develop. I appreciate a tight old school hour and a half but this needed some room to breathe and perhaps everything wouldn't have felt so crammed down your throat. If these girls were shown living their lives a bit and not constantly talking about men and the evils they have wrought. It would humanize a bit and make the medicine go down smoother perhaps?\n\nOverall I look forward to the unrated version and maybe an extended cut."

Black Christmas is filled to the brim with themes upon themes upon themes, the the way this film portrays these themes are incredibly misused, problematic and irresponsible.\n\nThis film takes its message and shoves it down your throat rather than actually doing anything meaningful with it. The end result is a poor attempt at talking about current topical themes and it is incredibly mishandled.\n\nThe horror in the film isn't scary, it's very much laughable and gutless. But a PG-13 is the least of this film's problems. The actors are alright, the characters are even worse. The best is Imogen Poots who is clearly the only one trying and is the only one bringing something to the film. The rest of the time it's just bland boring and doesn't know what it wants to be.\n\nThe film wants to be topical, it wants to be a horror film, it wants to be satirical and it wants to be supernatural and none of it ends up working. It's terribly written with terrible characters, bizarre decisions and it's ultimately just a very cringy film with very little to offer."

        "review_detailed_main": "I really do get what this movie was trying to accomplish. Female revenge and empowerment are satisfying themes, and basing a horror film on campus rape and toxic frats touches on a very real, frightening, and topical nerve. However, this loose reboot takes it too far, and goes quickly from feminist to just plain sexist, thereby destroying the intended effect. (Feminist movies are great. This is SEXIST.)\n\nKris is by far the most annoying character I have seen for some time. I'm fairly certain I heard her advocating that there should be more TRANS AUTHORS in the CLASSIC LITERATURE curriculum. It's the earliest indication that the writers are creating straw men to make their points. Speaking of men, the only two \"good\" male characters are shown to be easy victims of \"brainwashing\" into their \"true natures\" as men, which of course involves aggression and violence towards women.\n\nThe director has stated she wants the audience to \"feel seen.\" I didn't feel seen. I just felt misrepresented by two-dimensional women. The characters are so insufferable that their plight means nothing. Obviously they're meant to be the heroines, and we're supposed to root for them because they're outspoken against white men and they STAND UP FOR THEIR SISTERS. That is literally where the characterization ends; no one bothered to give them personalities. They are all slightly different shades of the same person. At one point, one girl apologizes to her friend for dragging her boyfriend along everywhere and says \"I like it best when it's just us four girls.\" I must not be a feminist if I enjoy hanging out with my boyfriend!\n\n(Side note: in the trivia section, it's stated the stage performance in this film was intended to be the \"feminist answer to the misogynistic Mean Girls.\" You know, Mean Girls -- the movie about women becoming comfortable with their true selves and learning to love one another as they are, instead of competing and hating. Again, point: missed.)\n\nBut let's get into this movie's most egregious offence, which is that it's not even high quality horror. I love horror and watch it almost exclusively. This is bad horror. Dollar store bad. It's cheap with the scares, and for all its attempted subversions, it's really bland and basic. Filmmakers like Jordan Peele have proven recently that it's possible to address serious social themes while terrifying your audience. To do this, the writing needs to be strong, the acting emotive, and the directing creative. This movie has none of those elements.\n\nSo, yeah. I hated this movie. I'm glad others hate it as well. Audiences recognize pandering nonsense when they see it. Hopefully this doesn't do damage to the marketability of female writer/directors -- we do need them!"

Highly odd for Black Christmas if u judge it by the 2006 BC. Although i did read it that this one was initially an R-Rated movie but was cut to be a PG-13 and it REALLY shows in its final result.\n\nThe twist of the story which is different from the two previous films is not as effective for me. Seemed kinda ridiculous, especially if the result of the movie was different.\n\nIts a very talky movie, more of a drama for the most part, female issues against men and certain men in the story. Takes up most of the movie.\n\nThe characters all make stupid decisions, which u can usually forgive as its the horror genre but this one is all the more frustrating since they presume they're all so intelligent and awesome. but they're just as dumb as potato. The men are portrayed as equally stoopid. It feels like a bad 80s's B-movie slasher you haven't heard of in that sense.\n\nThe final action sequence is pretty laughable and cringey, very far fetched and unbelievable.\n\nEven with all the talky dramatic scenes, if there was just more action and suspense i'd definitely have rated it higher and wouldn't have seemed a waste of money.\n\nOf all the movies i've seen at the cinema this year, this one would win the Razzie of the Year for me."

The movie is clearly sending an anti-abuse message, but their inclusion of rape as a plotpoint was incredibly tasteless and seemingly only included to have a clear message. Sexual abuse and rape especially is extremely hard to write. This movie failed on a pretty huge level. Everyone knows that sexual abuse is horrible. Rape should be handled carefully in stories specifically focused on the suffering and healing process of victims, not as a tacky add-on to a slasher which uses it as shock factor to make the culty bad guys extra evil.\n\nThis movie left me uncomfortable on all the wrong ways.

It's not no groundbreaking horror movie or bloodbath, but it's still popcorn fun. My only main issue was that too much was shown in the trailers. Way too much."

        "review_detailed_main": "I had trouble overcoming the fears of watching this movie, because they already let me down once... Can it get worse? Can it!? \"Black Christmas\" of 1974 is my all-time favorite slasher, and one of my favorite horror movies, it's minimalistic, obscure, atmospheric, well-acted, suspenseful, beautiful looking... The remake back in 2006 was very underwhelming and way too numbingly straight-forward, but even that doesn't seem as bad after seeing this one - one messy, messy \"re-imagining\" of a classic.\n\nJust to be clear, the movie isn't bad because it deviates a lot from the original. It's bad because the script, atmosphere and character writing is, frankly, either a complete mess or just plain flat. I think compelling and entertaining is what they wanted, but what they got is rather nonsensical and very lackluster even in the most crude terms of horror. I get it, it'd probably been received a little better if it wasn't using the weight of a franchise/classic name, but altogether, as a stand alone, 2019's \"Black Christmas\" is a failure at using its domain as a vehicle for badly done social and political messaging. The merry many of characters are very one-dimensional, the villain side is whack, the twists induce an \"ummmm\", and the overall suspense is executed with a very, very light hand.\n\nThis is a movie that doesn't inspire a lot to talk about, because of how wrong it goes in almost everything... For those that have never seen a \"Black Christmas\" movie, and/or those who are into modern teen horror, try it, but beware, there are many better, similar adventures out there. 3/10."

However the acting was decent, Riley (the main character) is likeable and fleshed out, the plot is fine (if a little predictable) and the hint of romance isn't too cringy or overbearing. Riley is the main reason I liked 'Black Christmas', she's a decently developed character and I could relate to her want to try and forget and not be a 'loud' feminist, contrary to the wishes of her sorority sisters. Most of the reviews seem to have a problem with the feminism. In my opinion this is done quite well actually, it isn't constant and adds to the characters. This mainly stems from the main character, Riley, who was raped, and her friends defending her and generally being modern, independent women. Therefore the feminism isn't needless or irrelevant and develops the plot. If you view this film separately from the original it is half decent and definitely deserves more than one star."

        "review_detailed_main": "1974's slasher flick 'Black Christmas' is a classically overlooked horror in which a group of sorority girls get stalked during the titular holiday period. When 2006's unnecessary trashy remake got critically slammed, it was a big surprise producer Jason Blum announced another remake to be in development with a more modern twist. Let's just say, this version is nothing like the previous two and could easily have been released under an original title instead of relying on some sort of legacy the '70s film has built throughout the decades.\n\nEverything starts off with a pretty basic premise we're all familiar with. A group of female students are stalked by a stranger during their Christmas break. That is until the young sorority pledges discover that the killer is part of an underground college conspiracy. But as the trailer kind of spoiled to whomever watched it, there's not just one killer, it's most of the young men that are part of this fraternity as some sort of hazing ritual.\n\nVibrators for secret Santa and one too many threatening texts coming from the long gone Hawthorne college founder later, girls are being killed offscreen - because this film is being released in Australia with an M-rating - and thus no blood shall be spilled. Unlike some mysterious black goo that appears everywhere the stalkers pay a visit.\n\nWhile Kris (Aleyse Shannon) pisses people, excuse me, boys, off by going around campus with a petition to fire professor Gelson (Cary Elwes) for his misogynistic literary choices in class, Riley (Imogen Poots) is dealing with her own personal demons. When the cause of all this revisits campus for the annual Christmas talent show, it's up to Riley to face her fears and stand up for what's right and call out the issues this school has been facing for far too long. With the help of her other sorority sisters Marty (Lily Donoghue) and Jess (Brittany O'Grady) she will have to fight off a horde of angry, blood thirsty, wannabe alphas and show this college how girls, I mean WOMEN, really fight.\n\nSophia Takal's (Always Shine) take on the slasher genre is both unique and ballsy. Blum producing a project with such a loud voice, is not only promising, but also shows that the big screen is a place for original stories to be told. The execution however is lacking something more. Takal and fellow screenwriter April Wolfe (Widower) have a lot to say and aren't subtle about it, which is incredible in every way of the word. But Black Christmas doesn't deliver on any other level. It promises a slasher survival film and what we get is a social commentary on white supremacist patriarchy and smart women fighting against racism and sexism. Hands down one of the strangest and empowering things you'll see this year, yet it's forgettable and mostly disappointing because there's nothing else to support those important words. A missed opportunity in what could've made Black Christmas the new standard in horror filmmaking. The horror genre struggles as it is. If Takal and Wolfe gave the horror aspect of their story more attention, so it could be just as strong as its feminist standpoint, the film would've been that puppy under the Christmas tree you've always dreamt of.\n\nIt's also important to note that this film shows how awful women are treated by men that don't understand the issue of sexual assault, consent and concerns. Kris' passion for equality in the film is engrossingly fascinating. It's also Aleyse Shannon (Charmed) who surprises and jumps in front of lead actress Imogen Poots (I Kill Giants), to steal the spotlight, and deservedly so. She brings a natural charisma and dominating energy to her character, while everyone else is barely present to even care if they'll make it to the end or not.\n\nThis \"remake\" would definitely have benefitted from an MA15-rating to amp everything up and raise the stakes. It's all just a bit too tame for a film of this genre and although Takal's efforts don't go unnoticed, I sure hope she gets to direct and write something with just as much freedom as she clearly had on this project. Despite the absurdness of everything else that happens on screen, unfortunately Black Christmas is nothing more than a bag of coal on a sad Christmas morning."

        "review_detailed_main": "2019: Black Christmas, directed by Sophia Takal, was a very bad, predictable reboot of a reboot (if you will), with CRYSTAL CLEAR messages, that they jam it down your throat every twenty minutes; it gets so damn frustrating!\n\nThere really was no \"definite\" story here; it played off of the few messages they kept mentioning as often as possible, and the boring, one dimensional characters, that lead me to keep looking at my watch to see how long was left.\n\nThe screenplay by Sophia Takal & April Wolfe was bone dry, to where it became hard to keep my eyes on the screen. Takal spent so much time developing these pointless characters, rather than building a great story. They all might as well have been cut out of an oak tree, that's how wooden they were - On top of that, there wasn't even an exciting villain, or really a villain at that!\n\nThe action was so cheesy, I could've slapped two pieces of bread in between it, and put it in the toaster oven and called it a grilled cheese. The kills were so boring and unoriginal, and for the most part, absent from the flick. There was no real build up for anything! Everything just happened out of spite.\n\nThe cinematography by Mark Schwartzbard was too dark and dreary. I actually had to squint a few times to try to get a better look at what was going on. I can appreciate the tone he was trying to set, but he just went way too dark with the palette.\n\nThe only few good things about this film, was the release date, and the duration. I couldn't have sat there for another minute! I am genuinely mad that I gave this film eight dollars, of my hard earned money. I sincerely hated this film to where I'd consider starting a boycott. One of the worst movies of 2019 !"

Some of the ending felt a bit abrupt, and I assume a lot of that was editing down to get that PG-13.\n\nOverall, I thought it was suspenseful enough and did have some surprising and fun kills. There were a few tip of the hats to the original that I enjoyed.\n\nSome of the activist stuff was a bit heavy handed, but I really think that the rape culture messages in the movie landed pretty cleanly.\n\nI would recommend seeing it on a Friday or Saturday night. Honestly, the audience participation in my theater was entertaining. It's that kind of horror movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Black Christmas' is the second remake of the 1974 festive slasher flick of the same title, which is arguably one of the best horror films of all-time, a perfect chiller for Christmas. The 2006 remake was pretty awful, but it at least had some fun with the gore content. This version however is extremely dire that constantly shoves feminist issues down your throat and lacking any sort of joy or redeeming qualities whatsoever.\n\nThe plot = A group of sorority sisters are terrorized by a masked killer during the Christmas break. That is until they discover that the killer is part of an underground campus conspiracy.\n\nWhen this originally came out, I had NO interest in viewing it after seeing the awful trailer that gave almost everything away as-well as the waves of negative reviews from both critics and horror fans. But one night it came on TV, and I thought oh why not, how bad can it be? Trust me this was bad from the weak screenplay, awful writing and shockingly messy editing, hell how does this even qualify as a remake as it basically has nothing to do with the original. Even as a stand-alone horror flick this is a failure, lacking any sort of tension instead focusing more on it's woke message which comes across as heavy handed. Hell even the outlandish final act couldn't save this turd and you could tell that nothing was given enough attention or care, instead it wants to beat you over the head with its message.\n\nOverall 'Black Christmas' 2019 totally SUCKS and in my opinion one of the worst slasher movies I've ever seen."

        "review_title": "Ignore the Men's Rights Activists: A Real Review",
        "review_detailed_main": "I just saw this movie after reading a bunch of snowflake men's activists on IMDB giving it 1 star and deciding I'd actually watch the movie and rate it myself. The verdict? This was a fun movie, that wasn't perfect, but had a lot to offer fans of the original and slasher films overall. Not every movie is out to reinvent the wheel, and this one doesn't. But it does enough things well with a different and clever spirit, more than enough to warrant its existence. How so?\n\nLet's start with my favorite aspect of this movie, the mise-en-scene. There were just a lot of really interesting shots in this movie. It was kind of beautiful in the way that people and props were placed on screen. The best example is the opening kill where the woman is made into a snow angel in the snow. Another great example is a complex stairway scene zooming out to show the chaotic nature of the holidays.\n\nAnother great aspect of this movie was the characters. It had a likable lead with an interesting back story. She was date raped on campus three years prior and the police didn't believe her. However, unlike the men's rights activist reviews on here, she is more three dimensional than just an angry feminist. In fact, all the characters are, even the one that is an angry feminist. That character receives push back from the other women, showing how nuanced feminism and women's attitudes towards fighting patriarchy can be.\n\nNone of the characters come across as one dimensional and there are some great male characters, including a pair of fun love interests (because women can fight for equality and date men, duh). Any men's rights activist who says this movie is about all men being bad obviously haven't seen the movie. It IS a movie about how awful rape culture is, and that's a real thing that should be exposed.\n\nNow to address the elephant in the room: does it respect the legacy of the original. I'd say yes. There are some great call backs, and while the original story isn't used, it lives up to the spirit of the original much more than the earlier remake. What the men's rights activists who trash this movie but glorify the original are forgetting is that the original was about a strong woman who makes the choice to have an abortion. It was kind of feminist itself. Also, just in terms of the tone it hits the mark (minus some supernatural schinanigans that is actually kind of fun). This movie isn't overly gory, which neither was the original, but it is creepy. Back to that mise-en-scene, the shots of the characters being watched through a window on campus or the creepy attic piece are all artfully done.\n\nOne last thing that the men's rights activist are ignoring. While the writing/directing team are two women, this movie has the backing of one of the most powerful men in Hollywood right now, Jason Blum. The production values really show. It also has horror legend Cary Elwes in a scene chewing role that is gleefully fun. Additionally, if the men's rights activists even saw the movie, they probably walked out before noticing that the film was dedicated to a man named Victor (not the MO of a bunch of men).\n\nSo is this a 1 star trash of a film about how all men are bad? Absolutely not! You might be one step ahead of the plot the whole time, but this is a well done and fun movie that has a lot to offer slasher fans. You don't have to reinvent the wheel to deliver a fun and clever take down of rape culture, which this movie absolutely succeeds at."

To attempt to do one with the world holding so much scinesism is brave. I genuinley thought they pulled it off!\n\nI liked the 'who's gonna die next and how' vibe that you just don't see anymore. I liked the basic tale of the story, with a girl poweresk vibe. Some good death scenes (without giving spoilers, watch out for icicles) and a good play on the having to go a bit silly vibe that sadly the Scream and Scary Movie genre of films created. This was backed up by it being a christmas homedy.\n\nI think go into this with an open mind, ready for a new funny christmas take on the slasher genre, and you'll enjoy it. Take it any more seriously than that and you'll hate it."

        "review_detailed_main": "That's the more accurate way to qualify this movie. Even the worst B-movie is better than this. I don't get how the ideology spread into this production has passed its way into the theatres. Well, it's clrearly infringing some guidelines but then how to speak about the main subject of this movie without myself infringing these same guidelines? I'll just say it bashes a certain group of people, without any nuance in an extremely grotesque way. It feels like it's been written by a frustrated kid that has just been dumped by her boyfriend. A pretty juvenile revenge movie, in all it's worst glory. This is important to denounce what this movie is really about under its inaccurate title. First of all, this movie could have been called Black Easter, Black Summer, Black Carnival or Black Whatever, that wouldn't have changed anything to the plot and storyline. The original left the identity and the intentions of the killer as a full mystery, then we could imagine stuff and so on, the 2006 remake gave it a clear connection with Christmas, but here, this 2019 version has NO connection at all with Christmas, naratively speaking. They obviously used the notoriety of the original 1974 movie just to spread some disgusting ideas in the mind of the public. Again, I can't say more about that here without crossing the established line. This movie is ludicrously full of clich\u00e9s (in every aspects...) and fall into the same deviance that what they are supposed to denounce. Fighting clich\u00e9s by spreading a ton of other clich\u00e9s. Insane. Nothing seems to save this movie from the disaster, except maybe the play of the main actress Imogen Poots that gives her character some welcomed nuances, and a few scary scenes (reminding a bit \"Scream\" actually...). And justifying that by saying \"to each their turn\" is just pathetic and irritating. I would have expected to watch an entertaining movie, but that's all but that, it's a high moralizer flick, worthy of the inquisitors burning the \"dirty witches\", which they actually do literally and figuratively. This film shows us that you must fight back the supposed oppressors... by taking their place. Just do to them what you don't like they did to you. It doesn't push reflection, it just arouses hatred. Don't loose your time on this! I would have put a zero star if there was the possibility. So it gets 1, the worst rating ever."

Not a fun bad movie.\n\nAs movies go, I wouldnt put this in the B Movie column as with too many bad horror movies, which are still awesome as long as you know its not Schindlers List, but I cant even call this a B Movie let alone a horror movie. More a message movie, a very bad message movie that probably had a different title that they changed because they realized thats the only way to get people to watch it.\n\nSkip, even if you love bad movies (which I do)."

I mean by the halfway point the director doesn't even try to hide it. \"HATE MEN\". And even tries to continue this \"HATE MEN\" agenda absolutely destroying this films integrity but shoving political nonsense down our throats.\n\nAs with a lot of female directors nowadays who seems to have had some trauma involving their relationships with men. They try and use this guise of \"Toxic Masculinity\" by grouping all males into the \"poisonous\" category and saying they should apologise for their existence, without even realising what they are trying to fight against.\n\nIf anything, the \"Feminist movement\" is the most venomous undertaking in the world to date (Yes, including the current conflicts happening in 2023). As they are not trying to fight for women's rights but more attack a man's lifestyle and their \"Privileges\" of just being a man.\n\nThe worst thing about this film is that it had a solid opening sequence, about women's fear of walking home alone, and holding her keys in a tight grip as protection as a suspect character is walking behind her. These fears are very real, it's a shame they decide to overshadow them with obvious force from the director by forcing their own agenda.\n\nThen the film gradually goes completely off the rails, becoming an all-sisters pledge with a sub-standard plot about a supernatural \"Bust\" who infects all the males who then decide to worship this Charles Hawthorne Bust infused with dark magic and become \"Just Men\"\n\nAs a positive I do adore that American college life and wish we had similar in Australia. The different fraternities and competitive superiority are enthralling, and I wish they kept to this premise rather than trying to attack their audience with nonsensical rubbish that all men are inherently evil.\n\nProfessor Gelson (Cary Elwes), Helena (Madeline Adams), Langdon (Caleb Eberhardt) along with Riley (Imogen Poots) were the most notable performances and seemed stand out which was hard with such a simple and lacklustre story.\n\nAnother negative is the film doesn't grip you with any x factor moment. Random fraternity boys with superhuman strength that start killing the girls that won't step in line, is so bloody weak, hasn't got deeper foundations, and lacks all sorts of morals and ambiguity.\n\nThe female leads apart from Riley (Immogen Poots) were written to be annoying and entitled as hell. Kris (Alesyse Shannon) was the most infuriating character and everything wrong with today's generation in the world. I was desperately praying for her death on every possible occasion. Nate (Simon Mead) seemed to understand the messaging and at least brought it up as why he is just lumped with the other rapists and bad eggs just because he is a man?\n\nNot a long review, because this film is as toxic as it gets. The storyline has little potential but completely caved in to cancel culture.\n\nRebutting the director, this is not what it feels like to be a woman in 2019, stop brainwashing young imbeciles with your fake patriarchy and male-bashing as it causes greater damage in today's world and is most likely caused but some deep wounds or daddy issues you have experienced in your life which you really need to seek professional help.\n\n1/10."

PG-13 : It's not so much that it's missing the stronger gore / violence, it's that it was filmed as an R rating and then sections cut out to lower the rating, because it does show in the film and makes some of the film incoherent and flow badly. Overall : still worth a watch"

By my teens, My Grandmother was a Stephen King fan from the start, and i got all her used books, so i guess rollercoaster fear & adrenaline entertainment are in my blood. Over that time, horror has evolved, changing repeatedly up to todays murder age of which I'm no fan. I actually like a plot more than i like more buckets of sadistic gore. Not that anythings wrong with sadistic gore on screen. I felt like this film was smart in the way it rehashes the boy vs. girls argument of the loneliest incel. In true millennial fashion, \"Black Christmas\" is chocka block full of social justice warriors trying to go after every issue & save the planet too like its a #MeToo fever dream. But this movie makes it hell of a lot funnier than arguing with online trolls. It makes enough fun of everyone so as to cleverly never take a side, it just lets the left & right have their say, and then they fight it out. Overall, its the body count, uniquely bizarre ways to murder victims, and the final twist along with top quality acting that really keep it fresh. In a good way, its not like anything I've ever seen. I sincerely look forward to more horror from this creator."

Still the ending was intense and overall that's an easy B- (7 out of 10) from me. if they had skipped that crap of the supernatural element and if the story was a little better this could be a very solid B-HORROR flick. still it's worth your time and money and at least it's much better than the previous beep remake. not as good as the original but better than remake NO 1. give it a chance."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie by no means is perfect. It is a fast paced little flick with a little bit of subverted tropes to keep it feeling a little fresh. This is by no means a top-notch horror film either. But just like the 80s when the classics that are now being remade or deemed as terrible, these are their modern-day equivalent. if one goes and trying to over analyze every little aspect of the movie and compare it to the original 1974 film, you are obviously going to have a bad time.\n\nHorror fans are honestly the most spoiled of all genre fans. They scream they want content like the old days, and when they get it, they throw it aside like a petulant little child. Then when they ask for original content and somebody puts something of substance out, it gets dissected unnecessarily into the most my new pieces so that I can be compared to other cinema and rendered derivative or copying something else. Viewers need to make up their minds and simply take what is happening at face value...\n\nPeople just like you love and appreciate the same films that you watched, but they wanna bring it to the modern age. If that doesn't show a sincere love for the art of filmmaking that they would imitate another artists work-which is the sincerest form of flattery-they need a reality check.\n\nIn all honesty this is a fun little flick with a little bit of a nasty little twist thrown on it. It has some fun, sick little moments with genuine flair, if you're willing to look past the simplicity of the plot, save for one big change as to the origin of the villain, you will have an exciting time that's by no means going to break the barrier of new age horror, but usher in a sort of love letter to the craft of slasher film creation. Keep it simple, keep it fun, keep it rolling, and just keep it entertaining.\n\nIn the end, that's all we want isn't it? To be entertained? If one goes into this movie expecting absolutely nothing they will get their moneys worth for a little adrenaline kicking feminist themed horror that throws modern fears of girls who this time around aren't going to grovel and plead to not die; they're going to fight back and show they aren't going to submit to death just yet."

Well, firstly it was a lot better than I thought it would be after reading loads of negative reviews.\n\nIs this movie a masterpiece, no! However, it is a fun watch. You can clearly tell this movie was intended to be more graphic but you can tell it was clearly cut to target a younger audience. It had some interesting kills (eg when a girl was murdered with Christmas lights) I liked this, was a festive way of slashing I just would of liked to see longer scenes of this, they were over in seconds.\n\nThere are several homages to the original classic such as the infamous bag killing scene. The character of Marty reminded me of Jess from the original, her look and mannerism mirrored each other. The film had a 70s vibe to it, with the styling and shooting. If you took out the phones, you wouldn't be able to tell which era it was.\n\nMy biggest 2 gripes with this movie are: 1: there are no creepy calls, the girls get a text just before they get murdered. They lead you on with one scene and you think yes here it is, but it was a red herring. 2: the supernatural element was bloody ridiculous, it wasn't needed and the inclusion of a cult wasn't needed.\n\nGiven this, it was a tense watch at time's and it had several good scenes. I thought it was better than the 2006 remake which was a bad bad bad movie but they had a better cast.\n\nIf you any a fun watch, I'd give it a go but go in with a clear mind and try not to compere it to the original. If you don't compare it, I reckon you'll enjoy it."

Thinking nothing could be any worse, I watched this film with some hope that other reviewers may be wrong, but sadly that wasn't the case. This film is a god awful mess. I hated the 2006 remake, and in the end, this film does prove to be better in some circumstances. However, where the 2006 remake was still somewhat fun and campy in an enjoyably bad way- Black Christmas is entertaining, but often incredibly annoying, making it quite a chore to watch. I must say that Imogen poots did try her best in the lead role, but every actor besides her really overdid it and proved to be of no help to the story or film in general. This film takes a very weird approach into retelling the classic film, with it being hardly anything like either film before it, but really vague interpretations of some of the settings throughout. There is a weird social commentary and overabundance of political correctness and feministic views- its not that I mind these things in any sort of way, but it just feels so incredibly out of place, and so forced that I can't help but lack the concern to take any of it seriously. It often incredibly overdramatic, dull, and far too serious for a film of this nature. The antagonists are empty stereotypes, as well as many other characters in this film, and the entire twist ending the film tries to go for is easily the most ridiculous thing I have seen in film in a long time. In the end, this film is garbage. It has one good performance, some potential, with none of it properly executed. Simply stated, this film deserves a lump of coal in its stocking. My Rating: 2/10"

Why I'm rating this so bad is because of the poor marketing decisions made for this: the trailer contains almost the whole gore and action scenes, lots of spoilers and on the other hand manipulated scenes which are never shown like this in the movie. Fortunately I haven't seen the trailer before. Also, the movie was cut down to make it less violent."

If only the plot followed that simple scenario, sadly this is a very poor re-imagining of the 1974 classic for the woke generation. Instead of having one killer there are multiple ones, I don't want to give too much away but rather than stick with the original psycho backbone this goes for a ridiculous frat boy cult, in the extras the feminist director says that it is a movie that addresses male dominance, blah blah blah. I am so glad that I didn't pay good money to watch this on the big screen, I'd have been fuming! The 1974 original is a classic, I do enjoy the 2006 remake but this 2019 version is an insult. Technically the cinematography and acting are OK and I enjoyed seeing all of the Xmas decor, however the kills are very lame and the film lacks any credible suspense. I will end my rather negative but honest review with a joke from the movie - \"Why is Santa Claus scared of getting stuck in the chimney? Because he's Claus-traphobic!\" That's about the only laugh that I got from watching this Festive turkey."

Giving it a PG-13 rating in some kind of inept to appeal to younger audiences just makes it less appealing to even casual horror fans.

        "review_detailed_main": "I wish 'Black Christmas (2019)' was better than it is. It has so much untapped potential, often teetering on greatness, and its unashamedly feminist message is fantastic. Sadly, though its heart is in the right place, it's rather flawed, skimping on the scares and being marked with several clear signs of some sort of studio interference. It feels like it's been cut down for its PG-13 rating (which is apparently what actually happened), with its quickly-cut-away-from violence being shaky and its dialogue often being obviously dubbed ('jerking off' becomes 'junking off', for example). A lot of the storytelling is also conveyed via audio looping, which is one of the classic traits of post-production rejigging. The end result is poorly paced and has a strange structure. It also features a few nearly nonsensical sequences that must've made sense in an earlier cut and takes a bizarre turn towards its finale that threatens to derail the whole endeavour. At one point, it seems to posit that sexism is the form of some sort of supernatural intervention, which would kind of ruin the entire point of the piece; there should be no excuse for sexism, no \"it wasn't really me, I was possessed\". Thankfully, the flick manages to sidestep this possible issue and is, ultimately, wholly on the right side of history. It isn't subtle, but it's about time someone literally smashed the patriarchy on screen. It's nearly satirical at times, with its villains earnestly complaining about the supposed marginalisation of straight white men, but it's played straight for the most part. It's at its best when focusing on the strong sisterhood between its leads, which feels genuine and celebratory. Sometimes, it bites off slightly more than it can chew and struggles to know what to do with the excess. Perhaps its biggest issue is that it isn't scary (at least there are no 'false' jump scares, though). It's not boring but it isn't particularly entertaining, either. It's not bad, by any means. It is underwhelming, however. It has a good message and feels so close to being a great vehicle for it. It's refreshingly bold and it knows exactly what it's doing when it comes to its feminism. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem quite as confident in its filmmaking. It's a decent effort, but not much more. Like I said, I wish it was better. 5/10"

Usual young adult partying, sex talk, bantering. Lots of plot holes like lack of investigation when coeds going missing. The lone dumb sheriff character was, well, dumb. Also dumb were scenes were the females band together & go charging/screaming after the baddies.

It is pointlessly distressing to all anyway, let alone the fact that there is no mention of it until you have sat down with your popcorn.

Feel sorry for the actors but they should never have agreed to the film anyway, hence the complete lack of a face that anyone has seen in film before. 100% would not recommend this film, it is an hour and a half of downers and negativity followed by a way too long, slow motion and unrealistic fight scene at the end."

Yes it has plenty of propaganda that is being shoved in our faces as of lately. And I suppose if you want to be offended by it then you may immediately down vote this movie to oblivion. But I honestly enjoyed this movie as much if not more than the last Ghostbusters. It has plenty of flaws. Does not have anything to do with the previous Black Christmas's. But once you see the film then you understand why they used the name and I think it fits quite well. The story reminds of a mix of a several different movies and shows that are centered around cults and secret society's. Is it super original? No. But it still offers a compelling and semi unique setting.\n\nAs for the acting I wouldn't say there is anything to write home about here but at the same time it wasn't that bad either. Other than the dj kid who I would argue wasn't as strong of a choice in comparison to the others. Some of his line deliveries were forced and not natural.\n\nIf you are just looking for a slasher film that entertains but isn't trying to shake up the genre too much then you will certainly find it here. Keep your sexism and political agenda out of it and you will probably enjoy it a bit more. However considering the name it shares I would hoped to have been given a bit more. It certainly leaves things to be desired for but overall it is worth a watch. And for those who want to find a fairly clean movie. This doesn't have much swearing and no nudity so that can be a plus or minus depending on the situation. Something that is getting harder and harder to find."

        "review_detailed_main": "James Brown once belted out that this was a man's, man's, man's world. The Godfather of Soul was right, of course, and one only needs to turn on the evening news to have that position put on full display. So, then, it's a breath of fresh air to see the suspenseful, sly, and sharp 'Black Christmas' use the slasher genre as an opportunity to call this out and even preemptively lampshade some of its most vocal critics. Camille Paglia fans, you are warned.\n\nTo go into this 'Black Christmas' expecting a beat-for-beat remake of the original would be a mistake, and one that is unfair to either film (or to filmgoers.) There are nods to the 1974 'Christmas' for those who know their stuff, but this film finds its own voice and is superior to most remakes for that reason.\n\nThe basic plot elements are there: murders in a sorority house during the Christmas season, a twist involving the mystery of who's carrying out the grisly crimes, and such. However, director Sophia Takal and her co-writer, April Wolfe, make the choice to give the film a point of view that is its own. Audiences are given a movie with that dares them to engage with it rather than replay other films' beats, and it's a better film for that reason.\n\nThe sisters speak truth to power and, in return, face the rage of a certain kind of entitled male figure. To some, that may be more stomach-churning than the shot of car keys to the jugular, but I suspect that is the point. While the film exists in its own celluloid world, it acknowledges that there are monsters who walk our earth and enjoy a certain degree of privilege not afforded to all, and that's as chilling a thought as any monster under the bed.\n\nSome of the film's best bits, in fact, come from smaller transgressions against that status quo - the \"Up in the Frat House\" song and dance that the sisters perform early in the film is hilarious even as its narrative is supremely uncomfortable, and there's a running gag about a missing Diva Cup that is smartly turned into an \"aha\" moment in the third act.\n\nThe sisters put a nice twist to the \"final girl\" trope. Characters have as much of Cady Herron from 'Mean Girls' in their DNA as they do Laurie Strode. When decisions are made based on their own agency and initiative, they are rewarded. Riley (Imogen Poots), in particular, has to overcome past trauma in order to not just survive, but to triumph. History informs actions, characters have distinct perspectives, and motives are clear and understandable.\n\nI went into 'Black Christmas' with an open mind and was rewarded with a wickedly fun trip to the movies. That it made me consider perspectives other than my own was a sign of good storytelling and refreshing in a time when remakes often feel the need to timidly toe a reverential line. Recommended."

        "review_detailed_main": "I liked the original Black Christmas (1974), it was creepy and an unsettling horror film that had interesting characters, I also liked the the 2006 remake Black Christmas (2006) which was also creepy and unsettling with it expanding on the idea of the original, despite some people not liking it; the 2019 movie is another remake or has been said to be a reimagining of the original. The remake/reimagining Black Christmas (2019) was a terrible horror movie that has a message that is too in your face, the performances are not that great, the dialogue awful, bad editing, and bland uninteresting characters; this movie was too focused on getting its message across instead of making a good horror movie.\n\nThe main characters in the sorority house are bland, uninteresting, and annoying to watch, except for one character; the only character I liked was Riley played by Imogen Poots, her character has gone through a traumatizing event with a guy who keeps making weird looks at her, and she is trying to get over it normally while her friends are trying to push her into doing it badly. All the men in the movie are unlikable jerks with them talking about woman poorly and woman talking about men poorly, except for one male character who is nice and likes Riley; it is hard to care about what is happening when you do not like any of the main female characters or every male character throughout the film.\n\nThe movie's message is as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face, I am fine with a message, but it is supposed to be a movie with a message attached not a message with a movie attached; the dialogue in the movie is awful and the way lines of dialogue are said is bad, with it basically explaining everything you are watching with lines of dialogue that sound like people arguing on Twitter. Cary Elwes plays a professor on campus who is stereotypically evil, and these hooded figures are connected to something that is so stupid and makes no sense, leading to the main antagonist hammering in the message and explaining everything and his plan. Also, every action scene is badly edited because of the PG-13 rating it has and why there are no gory kills, which is why they cut a lot and quickly cut away from any kills so you cannot see what happened to them.\n\nI know you cannot talk about this movie without being put on one side of a spectrum, especially any men who watch this movie, but also, women will say this movie is not for men because of what it is about, but I think men should watch this so they can understand what women are going through; despite all that, I am talking about this movie as someone who just sees this as a horror movie and someone who likes the original Black Christmas (1974). Black Christmas (2019) is a bad horror movie that was not scary with bland characters, bad editing, and a message that distracts you from the entire movie and can be offensive; I highly recommend watching the original Black Christmas (1974) or the 2006 remake Black Christmas (2006) over this 2019 remake/reimagining."

The plot of the movie was very interesting, mysterious and kinda similar to the previous movies. The storyline was well-written and everything was well-explained, even though it was way different than the previous movies. The characters were very interesting and kinda likeable, but they weren't well-developed. The filming location of the movie was just a snowy sorority house in small creepy town. The casting was just nice and their acting was descent. Sadly, it wasn't a very scary movie and most jumpscares were kinda predictable. However, it was very intense and most chase scenes were really good. The killcount of the movie wasn't bloody, at all and most kills were done off-screen... In my opinion, that movie should be R-rated, instead of the PG-13 rating. Because, it's a slasher movie and it should be full of gory deaths and creepy scenes. The opening scene was definitely predictable, but it was kinda promising and the death scene was nice! The ending scene and the plot twist were both kinda unpredictable, but I really enjoyed the 3rd act. Overall, it was an enjoyable remake, action-filled, but not very bloody and I would probably recommend it to my friends. Last but not least, that movie definitely deserves a sequel or a remake...!"

This one has none of the atmosphere of that film though. It is filmed in a prosaic TV drama style.\n\nBut the main sorority characters are barely introduced when suddenly they are all getting murdered in quick succession. I could hardly recall who was who half the time then they are killed. The second half quickly descends into ridiculous superhero sci-fi fantasy nonsense.\n\nPretty bad."

All of these plot lines are great. The problem with this movie is that these elements were not properly used or utilized. Had they used them correctly & done this movie with a more bleak or indie tone. It would've given it some realism. I just wish they had really taken the central themes of this movie more seriously. I'll admit I've watched this movie several times. Basically trying to find the \"ok\" in it. There are some elements I like about it & it's one saving grace is the lead actress, Imogen Poots.

        "review_detailed_main": "This horror film is centred on a group of sorority friends; in particular Riley Stone. She had, sometime previously accused a frat boy of sexual assault but wasn't believed by the authorities. In the opening scene we see a girl being murdered a dragged off by a masked individual; she isn't reported missing till later. After an event at the frat house, where the sorority girls sing a song suggesting they are a bunch of rapists the girls start being attacked. It looks like to them as if it is revenge for the insult. They later learn it is something deeper than that... not all of them will survive.\n\nThe original 'Black Christmas' was a solid little slasher film that wasn't trying to push a message... the same can't be said of this. It started well enough and successfully introduced the key characters. The fact that the girls upset the boys, who didn't think one of them could be a rapist wasn't really a problem and there is nothing wrong with the message that flirting isn't always an invitation for sex. The problem is it felt like a lecture within the framework of a horror movie rather than a piece of entertainment. When it looked as though the murders were the work of one or two individuals the story still worked reasonably well... the revealing of what was really behind the attacks was very disappointing and silly. The acting is solid enough, it is the material that is the problem. It doesn't help that it was edited to open it up to younger viewers; horror fans want scares and I can't imagine this appealing to young teens anyway. Overall I wouldn't recommend this unless you want toned down horror with a heavy handed message. I'll give it 5/10 as it did have some enjoyable moments and I don't regret watching it."

Is it tied in to the creepy fraternity that's been harassing them?\n\nThis new version of Black Christmas has a lot of big ideas and many of them are pretty exciting. It can't seem to get them all on one side, though, and it's obvious that being a horror film is one of the ideas the creators aren't the most interested in. Scenes of terror and suspense are tossed off as a minor footnote to 90-something minutes of sorority/frat drama that's executed with the subtlety of a drum solo.\n\nSome of this drama is good such as the backstory for Riley, played by Imogen Poots. Most of her material is handled in a more subtle fashion - it's the secondary characters who feel like brash cartoons. From annoying social justice crusader to drunken ditz, all the other characters feel like they're made out of cardboard.\n\nIf you're going to have such disposable characters, at least make the death scenes count, but this movie is chaste even by PG-13 standards - usually cutting away before there's even an attack. At least the 2006 remake, after realizing it couldn't compete with the original film's creep factor, loaded up on the gore and sleaze, turning it into a campy disaster of a movie that could still be enjoyed by bad movie fans. This new Black Christmas feels more like a student film thesis that's more to be admired for trying something different than enjoyed as entertainment."

It has it's own unique story and is nothing like the far superior original. Also I feel like the movie played it too safe with the PG-13 rating. Do they give away too much in the trailer? Yes, but there's more to it. Does it villianize men? No, not at all! Is the ending a little cheesey and bonkers? Absolutely! If you do choose to watch the movie don't go in expecting a remake and maybe you'll like it. Also if you are offended by the term \"toxic masculinity\" or like a lot of gore this movie isn't for you! You won't like it at all."

That said, if you can look past the comically bad twist, the final act isn't terrible.\n\nSure, the majority of the movie plays out like a PSA for female empowerment, but it's 2019, heroins are commonplace and I have no complaints about that.\n\nThe real crime is the misuse of Cary Elwes whose better days in Hollywood have come and gone."

This new Black Christmas gives us all the answers, but gives us a few of them a bit too soon, which leaves the film without a lot of suspense or tension. Subtlety is not the word of the day for the filmmakers of this new take on the slasher story and its attempts to be political lack nuance and make the entire endeavor feel more like a preachy student film or a very special episode of Saved By the Bell where the entire goal is to stand on a soap box and lecture you for 90 minutes instead of tell an interesting story with timely, political themes.\n\nAt a certain point, Black Christmas completely forgets it's a horror film altogether. In fact, it's obvious that telling an interesting, suspenseful, and scary story is the last thing on the creators' minds, which is a shame, because there are some good ideas that could have been explored involving sexual assault, rape culture, and men vs. women.\n\nImogen Poots is the clear star here and she does what she can with the material she's been given, but her main story arc involving a frat party sexual assault might have been better served in a more serious minded film that's more interested in nuance and real human truths."

For example, we are far from the quality of the last Halloween, also produced by Blumhouse. And in the end, the story is completely different from the other 2 films, they could even have given a different name. I particularly appreciated the last 30 minutes thanks to its atmosphere, but the big defect is the lack of gore, it is TOO censored. And knowing that the film was shot like an R movie, but that they censored it for its release in PG-13, it's disappointing for fans of horror movies and slashers. We see that they cut the scenes, and suddenly the tension does not work. We come to see a slasher and they hide absolutely everything, and do not even serve the minimum of hemoglobin... But otherwise, it is not the stew criticized by frail people who feel offended by the feminist and progressive side. The films that instrumentalize women and idolize men, there are hundreds, but no, it just cries because for once it is not they who are highlighted... It is true that the aspect feminist is less subtle than last Halloween (for example), but it's still a teen movie (a genre that is not known to be subtle), so it didn't come as a surprise. And in the end, I have already seen 10 times worse as a slasher, so this Black Christmas is pretty good overall."

The comedy was perfect imo opinion and all the death scenes were great, I especially loved Barb as a character. The second movie obviously didn't live up to expectations and there were lore changes that I wasn't fond of. The 2019 failed on every level for me. I couldn't find anything redeemable about this film. It's just strange to take the villain out of a slasher series. If there's no Billy, there's no Black Christmas. It just seemed like they used the namesake just to get guaranteed views which isn't uncommon nowadays. Pg13 slasher films just don't work, I wanted blood and guts yet I received agonizing mediocrity. Honestly as a feminist myself I found it disgusting that this was advertised as a feminist film when the original was much better at being both a feminist film and a slasher film."

The setting of both movies are the same dealing with someone/something killing sisters in a sorority house around christmas vacation. However, that's about it. This movie did have a twist that I should have saw coming but i like to watch movies while making models so I wasn't keen on thinking about why the camera showed a certain scene but for those who don't do what I do I would assume it would be seemingly predictable. This movie focuses of female empowerment between the sisters and feminism as the main theme. It's really just a movie that digs at Male ego.

        "review_detailed_main": "2 out of 5 stars (Has some good moments, but is overall bad)\n\nNote: Black Christmas is about sexual assault on college campuses. If that subject is uncomfortable for you, I advise skipping this film. Black Christmas is the 2nd remake of a cult classic 1970's slasher about a group of sorority sisters surviving masked assailants. I haven't seen the original film or its 2006 remake, so I figured I could analyze the new Black Christmas on its own terms. Unfortunately, my enthusiasm vanished faster than toasters on Black Friday as I watched a movie with solid acting, several good jokes, and isolated moments of tension be drowned out by a bafflingly mishandled message. Black Christmas is a giant lump of coal that fails both as a fun horror film and topical commentary.\n\nCollege girl Riley (Imogen Poots) is looking forward to celebrating winter break with her interchangeable sorority sisters (Aleyse Shannon, Lily Donoghue, Brittany O'Grady, and Madeleine Adams). A victim of sexual assault by the head of the campus fraternity (Ryan McInTyre), Riley and the girls call out the frat's actions via a Christmas performance (an admittedly satisfying sequence). However, the sisters soon find themselves cyber-stalked and chased by a mysterious hooded figure, putting them in the fight for their lives.\n\nBlack Christmas is well-cast and hits its comedic marks, but lacks effective scares. Imogen Poots and newcomer Aleyse Shannon are standouts, with the former providing a grounded performance and the latter (despite playing a wholly unlikable character) possessing a strong screen presence. According to my college-age sister, everyone looks and talks their age. Also, the presence of Cary Elwes, the heartthrob from the children's classic The Princess Bride, hints at the cheesy fun that could have been. Unfortunately, the kills are more obvious than the unhealthiness of a Big Mac, the supporting sisters have less depth than a slice of bologna, and 2 narratively critical scenes occur offscreen, yet the film is written as though we saw them.\n\nHowever, the biggest sin of Black Christmas is its attempt to marry sexual assault with fun popcorn thrills. It feels like chunks of 2 radically different movies were smashed together rather than one cohesive vision, offering a simplistic, one-size-fits-all nonsolution for real-world victims while also failing as a horror film. Skip Black Christmas.\n\nRated PG-13 for Violence, Terror, Thematic Content Involving Sexual Assault, Sexual Material, And Drinking"

This movie might has well have put the words \"all men are bad\" across the screen in flashing lights. There were a couple moments that I really liked, such as the main character's relationship with her creepy old professor, and someone being killed with a plastic bag over their head (great callback to the original). Other than that though, this movie was so forced, and even included a previously well liked male character starting an argument with his girlfriend and yelling \"NOT ALL MEN\". It's just so heavy handed. They could have made the very same points more subtly & used it to further the story of the characters, but instead it just turns into this random cult story that made me instantly not take it seriously. For me to say a movie is too man-hating says a lot, but I'm glad I got this movie with a free Redbox code instead of paying for it."

Is this movie perfect no not at all but the movie is not as bad as everyone is making it out to be and it is a lot better than a lot of movies I saw this year especially horror wise. The cast all does a great job and the horror elements are well used. The Dialog is at times wacky but not in a bad way. But where the movie flops is when it try's to get all political and it just ends up being triggering but when the movie is not doing that and it's being a horror movie it's a lot of fun to see unfold because the story is alittle over the top. Overall I enjoyed this movie it's not anything special but still it's a fun Christmas horror movie I can see myself watching again."

From the positive you can only rescue the suspense, the setting, the production and the photography. All else fails because this is a different movie that just takes the original movie title and some references. One of the big flaws in this movie is being PG13 because that can't be done in a slasher. The death scenes and violence feel heavily censored, which makes this movie fail as a slasher. This third installment of Black Christmas is undoubtedly the worst in the franchise and one of the worst reboots. My final rating for this movie is 4/10."

Note that the movie is tailored to a teenage female audience, hence the heavy theme of girl power and bringing attention to the terrors of rape, the underlying theme provides more horror than the actual movie. Most of these reviews are just men complaining about it, when the men are not the target audience. The characters are like able but sadly are hardly developed with the exception of Kris and Riley. The movie definitely could have done with a better pacing and bring more light to Jesse and Marty who were definitely strong actresses with not prominent enough of roles to real develop what are otherwise like able people. (Especially Marty who's actress, Lily Donoghue, has great charisma and charm that I hope to see later in her acting career.) People constantly beg in the horror community for something classic and simple, which this movie delivers, but still have to find a way to complain. Overall, Black Christmas is a great addition to the series of remakes but given its name, is burdened with living up to the previous films which were tailored to different audiences. The movie is a good slasher and despite its PG-13 rating is able to still provide a quality time."

I do love the movie's new take on how college/university doesn't believe the women and the men do get away with these horrible crimes which is so true in today's time and putting a horror spin in the movie and staying true to the original. If anyone who is a fan of the original Black Christmas please check out the new movie and watch it all the through before even passing judgement and then give your honest opinion. Lastly I had great time watching the movie and though some muddled dialogue and more character development could improve more but in the end it's worth seeing this holidays."

        "review_detailed_main": "Black Christmas (2019) is the second remake of the 1974 film of the same name. The film suffered from review bombing due to its focus on real issues that women must deal with on college campuses and society in its entirety (a potentially budding relationship portrayed likely wasn't to the taste of those who would resort to the tactic). Consent, sexual assault, and the fallout of speaking out against abusers are front and center in Black Christmas, making it a highly unique horror film.\n\nThe dialogue of Black Christmas is intelligent and realistic. Kris (Aleyse Shannon), a feminist activist, is at the heart of passionate and important conversations with her sorority sisters, Riley (Imogen Poots) and Marty (Lily Donoghue). Marty and Nate (Simon Mead), who are dating, have an argument that captures the debate around the language, who is to blame, and how society can combat sexual abuse.\n\nSeveral scenes display the non-belief of victims, the dismissive language used, and the feeling of betrayal is well done. Sophia Takal (also the Director) and April Wolfe did a great job with the script of telling a story that often isn't heard in film and much less in horror.\n\nBlack Christmas also steps out of the norm from typical slashers, displaying those being hunted fighting back rather than simply running when pitted up against an intruder. Those scenes were well done, showing the use of force multipliers to build tension, building a sense of an equal fight after an initial ambush.\n\nDespite the qualities of Black Christmas, there are some tiny plot holes that go without answering when the final reveal takes place, leading to several questions about how certain things were arranged. However, those issues aren't large enough to detract from the quality of the film.\n\nThe weight of the topic matter makes characters feel to have more of a purpose than simply being killed, which is a fresh take on the slasher genre, also making deaths affect the viewer a little more than the typical horror film.\n\nIf you care about a fresh horror take that tackles serious subject matter from the viewpoint of a survivor and is loaded with symbolism, then Black Christmas is worth watching. Don't pay attention to the review scores, this is a quality film that is worth examination from film students and horror fans.\n\nReal Score: 7.3."

Every time they had the chance to show us some blood and gore they would cut away with just the illusion of it, and this was consistent from beginning to end which may have watered down the suspenfulness of it all. I'll admit, at one point I was even like \"oh come on\" as I watched it. Pretty sure that this was the point of the movie, but i honestly did not connect with it. It's one of those situation where I was expecting one thing that I like, got something different, but the different did not replace what I came for. I did like the feminist concepts of the film. I thought this set up help to heighten the fear and made in scary. So it was scary. A little too obvious at some points that they were trying to scare us. Almost a few points in which they were poking fun at the genre but forgot to make us laugh. It was a good attempt. Maybe history would look founder on this film then I did today. Maybe you have to break a few eggs to make that omelet, but overall I wanted to like this movie once I fully understood the premise but I possibly got turned off the same way any women would get turned off of watching a naked dumb blonde being stalked by a slasher."

How can you do movies like Upgrade, Get Out, Split, Insidious, and even Happy Death Day (a decent PG13), then put out garbage like this sorry excuse for a horror film. The plot was changed, the acting was a mess, and it had feminism written all over it. If I want politics, I'll watch the news. I don't want it in my movies! And I'm a women!

Feminist ideologies empower women to reclaim their power and assert their worth. Unfortunately, most of the ideas in Black Christmas are half-baked. The feminism is mostly shallow and reduces several of the characters to \"man-haters\", when the reality of feminism is much more than that. The sisterhood between the characters is also weak.\n\nThe biggest disappointments about the film: poor pacing and lame kills - the first half of the film was particularly slow. There was also little tension, and most of the characters were undeveloped. The film also features one of my most aggravating horror cliches: a villain with a mask being incapacitated and no one bothering to remove the mask. The film loses 3 points for that alone.\n\nStrengths: the movie showed some promise during the sorority house invasion scene, when the women banded together and fought back, but that was short lived. That was probably the only tense sequence during the film.\n\nOverall, the film had promise but I would not recommend."

        "review_detailed_main": "Members of a sorority are being stalked and killed over holiday break in the second remake of the Black Christmas series.\n\nWe first see a young female college student stalked late and night and killed by what seems like more than one masked figures. The rest of the college meanwhile is prepping for the Christmas break. Our lead heroine Riley is still struggling to deal with being raped by a frat boy months prior. Also at the sorority house are her sisters Kris, Marty, Jesse, and Helena.\n\nDuring a holiday performance, Riley calls out the boy who attacked her while she sings a Christmas song. This seems to trigger a group of frat boys to get angry with the sorority sisters. Also involved is a professor who has a petition circling the campus about him and certain misogynistic teachings. A few more women are murdered by the masked killer leading to a bit of a supernatural reveal and ending that involves the issue of sexism and female empowerment.\n\nI have to admit, I was skeptical of this movie after reading harsh reviews from critics when this was released. I am a huge fan of the original 1974 classic, so I knew this wouldn't come close to touching that one. But I did expect a better result compared to the 2006 remake. In some ways this is a better film, but it doesn't feel like a Black Christmas movie which the '06 attempt at least gave fans. In this one the director has completely veered away from the Billy storyline all together. Outside of a few cute Easter eggs (Claudette the cat and a murder scene via plastic bag), there is no connection at all to Bob Clark's masterpiece\n\nThe acting is very good by all involved. Imogen Poots leads the way as Riley and does a fine job as the films lead. I really enjoyed the work done by Aleyse Shannon who in my eyes was the strongest character in Black Christmas. She brought a lot of fight to the role and it was fun watching her character.\n\nThere were definitely a few scares that got me. I found the killers costume/mask to be very intimidating and creepy enough. It lacked the tension that the original gave viewers with the man in the attic, but a few moments showed glimpses of hope. The message of female empowerment and mysogny on film is strong in this movie of course which has been well documented. I think it's a good thing to be told especially in a horror film. That's not the problem with this remake. My issue is having the Black Christmas name and not following the story in any way. Another flaw was the identity of what has caused the holiday massacre and the supernatural twist the movie took. Thats not scary to me which is why the ending fell a tad flat for me.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed Black Christmas way more than I thought I would have. It isn't the terrible movie a lot of people have painted it to be, yet at the same time is not an excellent horror movie by any means. It's better quality film/script/direction than the 2006 remake, yet I enjoyed that one more for at least trying to stick to the 1974 storyline. Perhaps if this didn't take the Black Christmas name, I would have enjoyed it slightly more than I did.\n\n6/10"

As a woman who has sat in an interview and listened to a white man tell me he was \"only interviewing me because he was required to and that women should remain homemakers\"....I get the battle for equality. However this movie was atrocious. It does nothing to empower women in its plotless script and everything to have us take 20 steps backwards. The attack on men was so over-bearing it was sickening. I don't need to beat men down to make them pay in order for me to be a strong independent and worthy woman. The lead female's acting wasn't very good either. She was supposed to be learning to fight after a traumatic event. Instead she was weak, inaudible, and cried a lot. Not a heroine. In the end their act to lock their attackers in a room made them stoop to the level of their attackers rather than overcome anything."

Sadly, the direction they chose was one that was not the best for me. My friend said it best as, \"A Twitter Post turned into a movie\", this horror/thriller will not offer scares, thrills, or even a semi-engaging story for those who are fans of the genre. This new take is much more political and has sacrificed so much to cram the beliefs of the production heads of this movie in that it was more infuriating than enjoyable. Again, the issues are not the problem, it's the presentation, and we've seen plenty of popular culture films handle political issues with much more class. After reviewing everything, this movie is not meant for the theater unless you are all about in your face popular event topics with a Halloween mask to get you into the film. I'd say this film is best left to accidental stumbling upon and would look to other options instead.\n\nMy scores are:\n\nHorror/Thriller: 4.0 Movie Overall: 3.0"

So, they wanted to make something special and then it was all downhill. The story was so over the top ridiculous that no sane person could take it seriously. There was only 1 other person in the theatre with us and he asked how we liked it. Turns out his friend was the co writer for the film and believes she was trying to put satire into the film and everyone missed it. So, knowing this, I may give it a second look from that perspective. He believes it will end up a cult classic. Time will tell."

Personally, I thought this film was enjoyable / mediocre / good - i wouldn't necessarily call it horrible. But I'll have to give kudos for Mr. Blum for picking this film up - it may not be a good film all through, but it is a starting point and an important time in cinema history, hopefully not the last feminist film to hit the big screen.

Some good horror scenes especially when the arrows start flying and an icicle is used as a deadly weapon.

Average horror which didn't live up to it's satirical potential directed and written by Sophia Takal. 6/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "I loved the original and the 2006 remake wasn't too bad, but what is this nonsense? First off, PG-13? Really?\n\nI did some research and the director said she \"worked extensively to make her vision of Black Christmas as feminist as she could\" and \"I wanted to make a movie where instead of feeling objectified or watched from a distance, the audience felt seen.\"\n\nWhich audience is she referring to? Obviously not a wide mixed audience of horror fans, especially one made of 50% males who aren't looking for sledgehammer social lessons. So I'm assuming she was aiming this at a small niche of women out for revenge against society?\n\nFine, I'm sure there's an audience for that, but why derail a classic film, which already had strong female characters (and I am a big fan of strong female characters), to make some airhorn-blasting statement? Make a separate horror film with a totally different title and plot instead.\n\nOnly thing I can assume is the director wanted to draw in a large male audience under false pretenses to slap them across the head with some \"see what absolute scumbags you are?!!\" message. It didn't work.\n\nMost male audiences will just get irritated and switch channels, if they even bother watching in the first place with the PG-13 rating. So your message is ignored.\n\nAnd the men who are actual scumbags will just laugh it off. It won't change their attitude or actions. So your message is ignored.\n\nMost female horror fans will no doubt be turned off by the heavy handed message too. So your message is ignored.\n\nSo that means you're basically preaching to the converted with the remaining target audience. Again, that's fine. But, again, don't take a classic and popular horror film just so you can twist it into some unrecognizable fluff for your personal sermon. It won't work. And it didn't based on most of the negative fan and critical reactions I've seen.\n\nMake your own film. And use some subtlety like other more talented directors do. Subtlety sneaks the message in. Bull horns and sledgehammers drive people away."

        "review_title": "Not just the worst remake ever made, but the worst high budget/theatre movie made.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Where do i begin? First of all, i am not a remake hater. Actually i enjoy them most of the time. I am of the mind set that a remake, no matter if good or bad, do not touch the original legacy, its just another version to enjoy. For instance i had fun with the Robocop remake even if it does not come close to the original. I took it for what it was, an average action popocorn movie that entertained me for 2ish hours. Some remakes i actually prefer like Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Ill admit i saw the OG very recently and i just feel it aged poorly, and maybe this is exactly what remakes should achieve. Bring the story to a new audience. The worst remake i saw before this one was probably Ghostbusters, but even that, as poor as it was, still managed to have redeeming features. The characters were poor, the plot wasn't good, but i dunno, i didn't cringe nowhere near as much. I don't wanna see it again sure, but im not against its existence...\n\nBut lets get back to the Black Christmas movies. I never saw the original. It is fairly old, and knowing myself i don't really enjoy movies made in the 70s. I recognize their historical values but usually i am bored. I do try to watch 1 or 2 a year just to be able to say i watched them. I saw the 2006 version same year it came out and i really enjoyed it. I taught the camera work was great, the atmosphere well done, the kills were brutal, and it featured a ton of actresses i either loved already or grew to love a lot since, wich make a rewatch always pleasant. I feel its been unfairly trashed and it deserve much more than the 4.6ish it got here on IMDB.\n\nI almost saw this 2019 version in theatre but can't remember exactly why i ended not to. I don't live close to the theatre so may have been simply logistic or another movie coming out same period wich i chose over. Then reviews came in and they were...not great, so never was in a hurry to watch it. Almost did last year but again for some reason just didn't happened. And i wanted to keep it for Christmas season, like i do with Halloween movies.\n\nThen this year i stumble across it in a video store clearange in a 3 for 5$CAD bin. I was like \"why not...\" And i decided to watch it yesterday after a few beers, wich is usually cool to enjoy a slasher for me. But after 20 minutes i turned it off, it was such a cringe fest. I decided to continue it tonight because im just like that, i hate leaving stuff unfinished and unlike video games wich may require 8+ hours investement, a movie is only 90m or so. Usually i will do it in one go but yesterday i didn't wanted to waste my good moob and beer on this.\n\nAnyway, sorry for this long review but i want to be honest, despite the bad reviews i still wanted to give it a chance, and i am not against women getting revenge on men in movies. I absolutely love the I Spit on your Grave movies (yes the remake, its unlinked sequel and the third one wich is a sequel of the first).\n\nI like rooting for the final girl, i like seeing bad guys get whats coming to them. But in this movie, its like the 2 screen writers absolutely hated men to a degree the revenge was actually them writing this script.\n\nEvery couple minutes you get cringe lines on how men are toxic, horrible, and they got \"white men privileges\" for whatever this is. Don't get me wrong, the whole situation of a rape victim not getting believed is truly possible and happen too often. But here they just try everything they can to make you believe every men are pigs or morons at the very best. Every male characters is threated so poorly its insane.\n\nThe trailers pitched this movie like a bunch of killers who attacked the wrong peoples but they fought back in cleaver ways. Lets just say this is not what you get here.\n\nI want to keep this spoiler free, but the majority of the movie is simply bad dialogues trashing men. There is very few tension in the typical slasher stuff, for almost 2/3 of the movies when there is violence involved its off screen.\n\nAnd it may not be that important but this movie simply borrow the title Black Christmas, it has almost nothing to do with the 2006 version or from what i read the OG. Yes there is sorority sisters getting attacked on Christmas, but thats as close as it get. Thats clearly a case of the crew being \"cleaver\" in using a known title to push a terrible movie that would had otherwise fail even harder, probably wouldn't even had been greenlit for theatre release, at best a VOD/DTV low budget slasher.\n\nAlright ill try to end this review, but really its fairly rare i HATE movies, at most im a bit bored and go on twitter a few times during them and when i finish them im like \"yeah meh...\" I then give them like 4-5 stars, 3 at worst, cause they ain't horrendous, they just slightly below average or a tad boring. This one is probably my worst rating ever. Don't quote me on it, but i think despite hating Star Wars Ep8 for what it did to the sequel trilogy, Luke Skywalker and SW as a whole, i think i still gave it a better rating.\n\nDid i seen worst movies in my life? Yes. Low budget stuff that was simply ridiculous. I don't think this movie has the worst acting, camera work or special effects at all. Its actually ok in that. The issue is the story, the dialogues, trying to push this ridiculous extreme feminist agenda to a point that as a male viewer, i can't find enjoyement in it. Its not even to a point where you know in slashers sometimes characters are dumb and you root for the killer and creative kills, no here you get none of that. Everyone is terrible and badly written and there is no fun kills, its as best generic kills that don't look horrible or badly done, but that are nothing special. Ok im sorry im out now."

If so, then that's actually kind of a brilliant attack, as it was in the movie. I give it a true 1/10.

        "review_detailed_main": "During the winter break at a college campus, rape survivor Riley Stone (Imogen Poots) is pressured by her friend Kris (leyse Shannon) to do a public performance calling attention to rape culture at a local fraternity. After the stunt is done, Riley and her friends are inundated with threatening texts and DMs, and many of their friends vanish without a trace. The tensions build until they find themselves trying to survive the night.\n\nBlack Christmas is the 2nd remake of Bob Clark's 1974 slasher classic, following a mostly forgotten 2006 remake that was critically and commercially panned. The new Black Christmas has been met with mixed reviews from critics and extremely negative reviews from audiences, but while I don't think the movie is good, it's not nearly as bad as people have been saying.\n\nThe movie does have a decent lead performance with Imogen Poots as Riley Stone, and she does a good job of serving as an emotional core for the movie by creating a sympathetic character. The movie does also try to address rape culture and toxic masculinity (even if this is clumsily done), and I respect that it tries to go a different direction from the original Black Christmas, but it's so far removed from the original it has no business being called Black Christmas down to the fact it's not a slasher movie.\n\nThe movie instead of being a slasher film feels more like a combination of the 2006 Wicker Man, Meangirls, and very watered down elements of You're Next and Ready or Not. The movie also adds a supernatural twist which I supposed is supposed to be serve as a metaphor for the toxic nature of tradition, but it's yet another element that divorces this movie from its source material. The movie doesn't have an awful premise (for the most part) and there is fertile ground that is touched upon. One scene towards the middle of the movie I liked was where Riley calls out Kris for exploiting her assault to spread awareness which was a nice moment of complexity that could've lead to an interesting discussion, but not only does the movie drop this point, it let's Kris off the hook in the process.\n\nBlack Christmas 2019 isn't an awful movie, but it's not a good movie either. It's well intentioned and has a decent lead performance with Imogen Poots as Riley Stone, but it's also ham fisted with its approach to the material and its themes, not scary, and doesn't even have any decent shock moments thanks to a PG-13 rating. I've seen worse, but I've also seen better."

        "review_detailed_main": "Black Christmas Directed by Sophia Takal. Written by Sophia Takal and April Wolfe\n\nOh boy... Let me start off by saying that I really don't like PG-13 horror movies. You have to cut the suspense at the knees. Horror is about expecting the unexpecting. PG-13 puts a cap on what can be shown or even implied. It is especially devastating to a slasher film. It neuters the film.\n\nSo this movie is already off to a weak start. The opening kill of the movie was a bloodless affair. Girl gets stabbed in the chest with the flimsiest looking icicle. No blood. Killer drags her away and the camera is trained on the entire time. No blood. I don't understand the point of neutering a slasher film to this degree. Extravagant kills are one of the backbones of the slasher picture.\n\nThe other problem is strapping this story to the baggage that comes from calling it Black Christmas. Black Christmas is one of the original slasher films. It has a certain villain and certain expectations that come with it. Why bother calling it a remake if you're basically grafting a brand new story onto the corpse of the name?\n\nI don't understand why they just didn't create an original film. There's a story here that could work. Building the framework of college rape culture into a supernatural story could have worked. Imogen Poots is amazing. Between this and The Art of Self Defense, I'm a fan. There is more going on there than the thin script gives her. She deserved to be in a horror film that was going to celebrate the cerebral work that was going on in her eyes. The trauma and pain of living in a place that is filled with haunting reminders of her attack. Her friend wanting to push back against her attackers and the culture of the campus that allowed her attacker to go free only rattled her more. But there's more to it than that. There is a force lurking within the college that is unleashing the worst traits buried in the men. The worst aspects of toxic masculinity if you will border on downright misogyny.\n\nSo there is a nugget of an idea inside this neutered horror flick. I could tell what they were trying to accomplish and honestly the ending bothered me a bit. It was not earned or built up. It just comes out of nowhere. It doesn't work as a horror film. Even with the good performances, it still feels silly. Much like The Hunt, this also felt like a Facebook comment section came to life. It lacks some of the nuance that could have brought to life. The characters needed it for us to feel anything for them. And for God's sake, don't call this movie Black Christmas!!! I give it a D."

        "review_detailed_main": "The trailer made it look like this would be a fun, sorority girls, slasher, kicking butt movie. The minute I rented it I felt I'd been tricked by the trailer's slick editing and I was in for a super low budget film in the hands of an amateur. Why remake a super low budget movie with another super low budget movie? That makes no sense. I though this would be a fun upgrade of a fun '70s? '80s? slasher. Nope. It's just a bad student film.\n\nLike, was there even a cinematographer on this film? A set designer? Who did hair and makeup? The actresses? It was very hard to find any production value whatsoever other than there are actors, a script, sets, a director...and, I don't know, I'm not sure if there was any other crew on this film. They didn't even have music for the girl's Christmas musical number even though there was a guy, Landon, who was clearly supposed to be a DJ. It says it was a $5 million budget but my guess is the director embezzled that money or was so incompetent she blew it...who knows, but it wasn't on the film. $5 million is not a lot but it's not a little, and it can certainly do a lot more than is shown on screen. And given Blumouse gives a set budget everyone must adhere to, plenty have managed to make good films on a small amount. Like, this wasn't even as good as a low budget SyFy movie that revolves around mutant animals.\n\nI was mostly confused by how bad it was. I've come to expect more from Blumhouse. The Hunt, Happy Death Day, Ready or Not, Fantasy Island, Get Out, Truth or Dare, all very entertaining films by Blumhouse of varying levels. I thought wrongly this would be on the same level. Imogen Poots was fine, everyone else was fairly terrible. I felt more like they pulled people out of an acting class, said there would be no pay but they would at least get Kind bars and water from craft service, and a credit on a film. The script is bad as is the directing, or lack there of. Did they have lights? It's the flattest film I've ever seen and the colors just all mashed together. I simply don't know how this woman was allowed to direct a film. It was basically, an embarrassing step for women. Clearly she's somebody's niece 'cause I don't know how else she was allowed to direct or even write a film.\n\nBlumhouse seemed to be on a roll until this film. A major disappointment."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have to start this review by saying that this film has absolutely no business being a 3.1/10. That is criminal. Is it a masterpiece? No. Is it one of the worst films ever made justifying the the 3.1/10? Absolutely not either. Like most horror movies there is some good stuff and some not so good stuff. I'd even suggest there is a lot more good stuff in this one than your average horror movie made today. I think a lot of people have jumped on giving this a 1/10 without even seeing it based on the fact that it's a remake, the fact that the original trailer gave away far too much information and because the film was rated PG-13. Very unfair and unjustified.\n\nThe thing about being a PG-13 horror movie is that you have to be really smart to get away with it. You have to have an edge in your story-telling, an X-factor if you will, that can drive the horror and make people forget that what they're actually witnessing isn't as violent as we have become accustomed to seeing. 'Black Christmas' tries really hard to have this, but ultimately comes up short. It has tried to reinvent itself into a \"Girl-Power\" film, and actually has some moments that were well thought out, but the ending leaves a bit of a sour taste in your mouth in that respect.\n\nIf you broke the film down into thirds the final one would be by far the weakest. It undoes almost all of the good work put forward in the first two. The film sets itself up in a way where we are focused on a group of girls who have some things going on, and some conflict with the boys yada yada, and inter-spliced with that are random kill scenes of various girls. It sets itself up in a way to be a whodunnit (I haven't seen the original or the first remake to know whether that was the same in those films). Then along the way we meet various characters who could or could not be behind these killings. That was the element of the story I liked the most by a long way.\n\nThen the final third rolls around and some characters make some unbelievably stupid decisions (what else is new right?) and the movie becomes something else. It's still a horror movie, but also it's kind of not anymore. The \"Girl-Power\" side of things suddenly becomes overwhelming and instead of invigorating the movie, it drains all the energy out of it.\n\nI was really excited when I heard another 'Black Christmas' movie was coming out because I had never seen the original or remake and I thought this was the version I will actually get around to seeing. It was filmed in New Zealand too which was an added bonus. Then came the news about it being PG-13 which was admittedly disappointing, and then came the news that it was no longer going to be released in New Zealand due to poor quality and then the poster came out and was incredibly bland - and with each bit of news like that my excitement levels depleted. I'm glad I did get around to seeing it in the end though because it is nowhere near as bad as people are making out. It may not be to everyone's liking, but I would implore you to at least make up your own mind on it and not be deterred by the unwarranted hate this film has succumb to."

It's the \"stupid\" kind of bad. Too stupid to be taken seriously, but not to the point you'd ignore its stupidity to make it fun. The movies apparently tries to take itself seriously, and one simply doesn't buy it. So, I wouldn't call it bad, because bad can be fun. It's stupid. Take it from a person who normally likes movies that get a lot of hate, such as Star Wars I, Ghostbusters, the forgotten sequel of Carrie. Black Christmas is definitely not worth your time. Look up the story online, with spoilers, and you'll see what I mean. If you really want to watch Black Christmas, go for the 2006 version. It's bad, but not \"stupid bad\", it's \"kinda fun\" bad. I can't unsee it, but you can save yourself. Stay away from this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film essentially begins with a female student at Hawthorne College by the name of \"Lindsay\" (Lucy Curry) walking out of her sorority house at night on her way to see her grandmother. Suddenly, she is accosted by a man wearing a hooded robe and brutally murdered. The scene eventually shifts to another college student at that same sorority named \"Riley\" (Imogen Poots) getting a call from Lindsay's grandmother saying that she never arrived. Around that same time, Riley had witnessed what appeared to be a strange initiation ceremony at one of the nearby fraternity houses but decides not to say anything about it as she has other issues on her mind. We then learn that Riley had been raped by one of the members of this fraternity and has had difficulty dealing with it ever since. So, to show their support, several members of Riley's sorority band together and perform a musical number at the fraternity house where they mockingly accuse them of tolerating date rape. Not long afterward, members of the sorority begin to die one by one. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this film started off well enough and seemed to have definite possibilities. Unfortunately, rather than making a horror film that could appeal to fans of the genre, the director (Sophia Takal) decided to deviate from tried-and-true horror techniques and appeal to feminism instead. The ending was especially ludicrous. One other aspect worth mentioning is the fact that, in spite of the title, this film bears only a slight resemblance to the 1974 classic and as a result viewers should not be misled into believing it is a remake. Be that as it may, I don't consider this to be a good horror film by any means and I have rated it accordingly. Below average."

However, this film aint good. Now, I consider myself a feminist and am all about girl power but this film AIN'T SUBTLE. None of these characters feel real. They feel like caricatures. It was tiring. I mean there is a scene early on where one of the girls takes a diva cup and inserts it in front of one of her sorority sisters. Is this supposed to be empowering? Cause it's just plain nasty. And its an extra fail because for a film that is supposed to be all \"girl power\" I didnt find myself really rooting for them. They just werent very likable characters. The only one that gets any sort of depth is Riley (played by Imogen Poots). The men dont get any depth either. It basically boils down to \"men bad and power hungry\".\n\nAlso from a horror aspect, a lot of the scares are very cliche. With the bad guy(s) seemingly disappearing and reappearing out of thin air and convenience of plot. And also without giving much away there is a certain twist later on the film with a character .....but it makes the scene prior with them make absolutely no sense. And a minor quibble but I feel like it has to be said...why do all the girls have the same ringtone?\n\nDo I have anything good to say? Well I think Imogen Poots was good.

No, I don't want to raise any existential, rhetorical, or philosophical questions; - just wondering because I don't necessarily see the 2019 version of \"Black Christmas\" as a remake of the almighty 1974 classic. Sure, the events take place on a university campus around Christmas time, but the plot - and especially the denouement - are very different. And luckily so, I daresay, because if the dumb plot twists of this script had featured in the original, it probably never would have become a genre landmark.\n\nThe 2006 version, starring Lacey Chabert and a whole lot of other contemporary scream queens, is much more of a straightforward remake. When it was released, I was one of the many people who labelled it as a redundant, disgraceful, and terribly inferior to the Bob Clark original, but if you now see what a chaotic and frustratingly woke version writer/director Sophia Takal came up with, \"Black Christmas\" 2006 isn't so bad in retrospect.\n\nThe Christmas holiday break is approaching and a bunch of girls from different sororities are being stalked and killed by a maniacal killer with a mask. So much for the resemblance to the original from 1974. The female main characters have been completely upgraded to #MeToo and Black Lives Matter figureheads. These female students fight back hard against the male fellow students (and teachers) who still consider themselves superior and think that they can violate female students without consequences. The result is that every man in \"Black Christmas\" is very caricatured as either a sexist pig or a spineless sulk. The girls, on the other hand, are feminist to the extreme. This means preachy and no longer objective. The plot ends with an absurd and anything but believable twist that doesn't belong in a slasher at all, but rather in a very bad & low-budget B-movie about witchcraft or something.\n\nIt could all have been quite fun and entertaining if the idiotic plot was camouflaged by extremely bloody murders and gratuitous blood of sex. But the murders are tame and mostly out off-screen (just to get a darn PG-13 rating) and the girls are too emancipated to walk around in underwear. In fun woke movies (such as \"The Slumber Party Massacre\") this is creatively solved by gratuitous male nudity, but \"Black Christmas\" is not that clever.\n\nThe film does get two extra points. One because Cary Elwes plays a very silly role with a lot of dedication, and another one because I thought the act/song \"Up in the Frat House\" was funny."

I knew this 2019 remake was going to be completely different. I thought it might be fun like the 2006 version. I'm not a hater, especially when the director takes a classic film in a completely different direction rather than trying to duplicate the original. I expected a popcorn film, so my expectations were low.\n\nPerhaps I have a different perspective than most of the reviewers here - I have always acknowledged how feminist and progressive the original 1974 Black Christmas is. The \"final girl\" is pro-choice, sexually active, breaks up with her fiance, and is seeking an abortion. No silly rules about virginity or explicit nudity. It's part of the quality of the Bob Clark film. But only a part. Still, I respected the huge feminist turn this re-imagining took to the left. It was a bit obvious and heavy-handed, but it's also a film for young people so I was along for the ride. I found the social criticisms timely.\n\nBut they lost me with the black goop plot line. The first two films aren't supernatural at all (although the atmosphere and framing of the 1974 version is arguably spiritual in a haunting way) and this third installment did it poorly. Very poorly."

This film can be seen as feminist and yes I believe it is. However I liked the fact it was different and is seen as a feminist film.

        "review_detailed_main": "The stage curtains open ...\n\n\"Black Christmas\" has been receiving some bad reviews, and a couple of my friends told me not to waste my time on it. I should have listened to them. Yeah, this movie is pretty bad. It's the ultimate exercise in Girls vs Boys with less than satisfactory results. Why, oh why, do movies like this even have to be made in the first place? I guess if we didn't have underachieving movies, we wouldn't appreciate the truly good ones as much.\n\nThe story centers around our main character, Riley Stone (Imogen Poots), the silent type ... a recluse who would rather sit in the corner unnoticed than take any chances. As the story develops, we find out that Riley wasn't always this way. In fact, she was quite the opposite until she fell victim to a local frat boy, who took advantage of her in the worst possible way. While this is going on, a killer begins to pick off sorority girls one by one until it becomes obvious that there is some sort of strange conspiracy going on. Riley and her sorority sisters are all in danger and need to find out the reasons before it's too late.\n\nWell, where do I start? To begin with, the production values are very low here. It felt like someone was walking around filming the scenes with their smart phone and then it was cut later with no success. This, in turn, gave us below par cinematography and editing. The direction was okay, but the acting didn't measure up - except for Imogen Poots, who really seemed to care about her part in the movie. Even Cary Elwes drops the ball here. And the premise behind it all was absurd.\n\nThis movie is an atrocity. The only reason it gets a 2 star rating instead of the lowest 1 star, is because of Imogen Poots. She made a few scenes interesting and worth watching - but seriously, that's it. This is a pass. Believe me, if you never see this movie, you aren't missing out on anything. It was a waste of my time. 2 stars out of 10."

The only real factor that tends to be of much use here is the solid and far more enjoyable stalking scenes than expected. The central concept of the evil fraternity coming under the influence of the special goo that turns them into raging misogynistic killers and striking back against the sorority to install a long-forgotten notion of male-dominance in the school works as a plausible enough reason to get everything started off here. While that works nicely enough, there's also the series of encounters that take place with the full-on out-of-control beings that are in place here, with a solid sequence along a general suburban street decorated with plenty of lights and lawn ornaments, a couple of attacks in the sorority house that makes for some admittedly tense moments, and the interesting shenanigans that take place in the finale involving the sorority group fighting back against the cult offer up some frenetic sequences. These offer up the main likable factors as there are a multitude of issues here holding this one down. One of the biggest drawbacks is an absolutely asinine and illogical storyline that never manages to be anything more than a thinly-veiled attempt at misguided toxic masculinity. The entire notion of their skits and outbursts through the film is based on attempts to condemn males for their traditional values and standing in the community being able to do what they please at the expense of women who are just supposed to take it, but it does so as angry and confrontational in the approach as it can. Lumping all men together regardless of their intention, upbringing, or background and arguing for the sake of putting forth this combative form of feminine power is the completely wrong way this type of mindset should work as the supernatural exploits trying to pull off this wrong-headed gender politics makes for an utterly maddening time. That ties into the other big overriding issue with the film is that there's so much time spent on this political mindset being bombarded into the viewer that it refuses to be a genre effort for much of the running time. Far too much of the film consists of the group making grandiose speeches about the evil nature of men or browbeating anyone over the head who disagrees with them to make the group appear right but instead come off as irritating busybodies with how they approach everything that the film has such few encounters with the killers it can feel quite dull. Very little of this one has anything to do with the original that there's no reason for the turtle connection, and with these few encounters all generating so few scares, a sanitized sense of gore or bloodshed, and such dark lighting as to make most of what's going on immensely difficult to tell what's happening all combine together to be an absolutely useless genre effort.\n\nRated PG-13: Language, Violence, intense themes of sexual assault, and drug use."

The pacing of the film is absolutely terrible, and the sorority girls spent over half of the film just screwing around before any of the action and \"scares\" actually start. Speaking of the scares, it was not scary at all. None of the jump scares work, and the film lacked anything creepy or disturbing. The film also aggressively pushes a feminist agenda, which I personally have nothing against. I just think that if that is the route that you are going to take in a film, you should make sure that the movie is actually good, otherwise you're not really doing yourself any favors.

        "review_detailed_main": "One of horror's biggest horrors in this current age is the updating of classic material to fit modern social issues, or to reflect new processes in storytelling. It has produced some decent material (\"Halloween,\" Child's Play\"), some excellent material (\"The Invisible Man,\") and some absolute tosh (\"Pet Sematary\"). You can add this update of \"Black Christmas\" to the latter. In the original Black Christmas, an unseen menace called the vulnerable sisters of a sorority, and as the calls increased in frequency and madness, girls began disappearing. The denouement and climax wherein Jess finds herself alone in the house with the madman is a short orgy of horror, a classic build up of tension and a twist that has since been repeated all too often. In 2006, Glenn Morgan took on the legend of Black Christmas and created a messy, silly confection that took the premise and turned it into a throwaway, fun horror with eyes being popped, icicles falling indiscriminately and a hilariously tasteless backstory for the killer. It was not liked by critics at all. But history might look fondly upon that addition when comparing it to the 2019 addition.\n\nAs a girl struggles with her masked assailant in the snow, her efforts result in a snow angel being created as she is stabbed to death. Dragged away, the camera stays on the remnants of an angel murdered. Can you say \"basic\"?\n\nIn \"Black Christmas 2019\", college girls are still receiving text messages from an anonymous source threatening death, but it's given a feminist twist (and a trailer that gives it all away). It manages to reference the original, remake (along with blatantly stealing one of cinema's biggest scares from Exorcist 3) without any of the tension of the original or fun of the first remake. The makers also made the confounding choice to remove all gore \"to ensure young girls can see it.\" The hubris is astounding.\n\nWhen taken alone, some moments do pop - the first home invasion is a fun bit of female violence and one attic scene does manage to drum up some menace - but it collapses under its pompousness as it tries to re-balance the scales of horrors that have befallen helpless women over the past 40 years in slashers. Perhaps had this been released without the connections, the creators could have found a fun quasi \"Your're Next\"/\"Girls with Balls\" with the same message but instead it just comes across as a humorless bit of tripe."

Boy was I wrong!! Honestly the plot was stale, boring and predictable to the T. The ending was trying to create a climax of feminine super power but it just lacked vigor and was rather awkward and didn't flow. I had to give this a rating of 2/10 because the only reason it didn't get a 1/10 from me because I respect the effort put into it by the director and the crew.

I'm a man and I'm feminist, but the script treats many men as bad and just two as good ones, also there is silly situations about some events and even stupid supernatural moments. The cinematography is the best of the film, but the direction and acting are really awful. Cary Elwes is a good actor but this time his performance was weak, only Aleyse Shannon's acting was good. The film is bad, not a big trash, but not good either."

Yes the audience learns early on who the slasher is, so to speak, but that hardly makes it predictable. We know Michael Meyers is the murdered in Halloween-are the same reviewers ranting against that? I didn't think the acting and writing was terrible either. Yes, some characters make stupid decisions-again not unusual for a horror film so why have beef with this one? I'll tell you why. Because this movie also has a message against the patriarchy. It's a movie with feminist characters who are fighting back against violence against women and male supremacy. The horror is not that women are being murdered. The horror is that there are still men who are threatened by women finding their voices and power. I also saw some complaints about the PG-13 rating and lack of blood and gore in this movie. I actually appreciated the lack of blood and gore that is so gratuitous in other horror films. I have an imagination, so I can use it and don't need to see blood, brains, and guts everywhere. Overall I wasn't at all disappointed by Black Christmas. It was what I expected, maybe corny here and there, but a decent slasher flick."

The characters, particularly the protagonists, are insufferable, making it hard to root for anyone or care about their fate. The main character is especially frustrating-she feels like a less compelling, even more wooden version of Bella from Twilight, which is no small feat. Her dialogue and actions come across as forced and devoid of any genuine emotion, which drags the movie down further.\n\nIn hindsight, I wish I had done my research before sitting through this movie. The trailers might have promised a modern holiday slasher, but the final product is messy, uninspired, and a complete letdown. Black Christmas (2019) fails to deliver on its horror roots, making it a regrettable viewing experience."

For whatever reason, the feminist stuff didn't bother me, and without factoring that in, the movie is just the average horror crap we get every year. Oh, believe me, I agree it's ridiculous and implausible, but years of watching bad, low budget slasher movies already prepared me for that. I agree that going PG-13 made it less interesting too, but for whatever reason, I didn't hate it."

Somewhere in the middle of these two are about 5 cursory minutes worth of scenes trying to remind us we're watching a slasher movie.\n\nOne could easily see both variations of this film working in their own ways, but together, it's like watching The War of the Roses as the mismatched couple realizes they just can't live with each other and are completely incompatible together.\n\nI couldn't help but picture a film where sexual assault is still addressed and toxic frat boys still hold a sorority under its grip of terror for naming one of their own as a sexual abuser, but without all the silly cult stuff and poor attempts to be woke with that awful friend of Riley's who bristles every time a man walks by her or opens his mouth."

        "review_detailed_main": "Yes, Black Christmas (2019) is very feminist (I personally didn't mind as I didn't find it too distracting/offensive to me, considering I am a male). Yes, Black Christmas (2019) has a lot of the #MeToo movement type-of-messages within it.\n\nHowever, I can easily look past all of this because the film tended to have a lot to it that helped it not be annoying to me.\n\nThe writing I found to be great. The characters I found to be extremely likable. The chemistry between the leads is good, The twists are unexpected and shocking. While some of the dialogue has a lot of cringe within it, I found the film/writing to be mostly realistic enough that the dialogue blended in because in the end, Everyday we say a lot of cringe, and this film does it well.\n\nPeople kept complaining about jumpscares, but I found there were probably under 10, and even then, Most of them weren't too annoying for me (and I hate jumpscares too). To me though, The jumpscares somewhat helped the films creepy vibe, I don't know.\n\nThe direction is average. Not amazing, but certainly not anything below OKAY. The direction is good enough, and the cinematography is fine. I don't look for amazing cinematography in the films I watch and if you're like me in that sense, You'll be just fine.\n\n(If you do look for exceptional cinematography though, Go watch Little Women or The Lighthouse.)\n\nNow, It is time to address the elephant in the room.\n\nTHIS IS A REMAKE.\n\nA second remake. Now, Here's where everyone reading this review questions me. I have never seen the previous films. I watched this due to the fact I love slashers, and this one was the newest to release to DVD (and during this pandemic, Walmart is still open, and I got money I wanted to buy a new release with!). I also loved the cast (the acting is great also) so I bought it to watch. From what I've heard, This film is nothing like the previous two, and I suppose if you're looking for a true \"Black Christmas\" It seems you won't get that (why is it called Black Christmas though? I question that slightly).\n\nOverall rating: 6.5/10. I personally loved it but find that a 6 fits it best. THE GOOD: Cast is great. Great characters/character development. Never boring. Writing is better than most BLUMHOUSE productions. Creepy vibes that might just scare you. Great soundtrack/score (For the few seconds you heard it THAT IS). Great twists/Awesome ending. Decent-enough tone. Somewhat funny at times (intentional I'm assuming). Cast shares great chemistry. THE BAD: The feminism might divide viewers (me personally, I had no problem with it and if anything, kinda enjoyed the added feminism purely because it made the film feel more unique, which is what I freaking love in fun horror flicks like this). Somewhat bland direction despite the great pacing. Film leaves a lot to be desired due to all the \"quote unquote\" cuts made to make the film PG-13 (which I didn't mind personally). Has barely anything to due with the originals (once again, I DO NOT MIND THIS). Cinematography might just be too average for some viewers (not me though). Jumpscares might annoy some."

It is a good horror movie. I am a man and I like this movie. And it is not a remake."

        "review_detailed_main": "Black Christmas is more a reinterpretation of the original material and therefore does not have much in common with its predecessors. And let's be honest: a third time the roughly same story, which was already seen in dozens of different versions in other Slasher movies, would not have been worth the effort. So here is trying to give the genre a new perspective, which is sometimes more, sometimes less. The film itself has been rated negatively by the press and the audience for the most part, although the criticism partially agrees. However, the film is not as miserable as many claim."

        "review_detailed_main": "Wowwww I almost didn't watch this movie based off the rating, and I am so happy I did. Let me preface by saying I didn't watch the original or any other versions. I love old horrors when I'm in the proper mood, but nothing beats a modern movie with a decent budget that just doesn't feel cheesy bc is the bad cameras. This is a good movie with a decent budget. Horror movies are few and far between, if you're like me and love movies so much you'll watch anything decent. Watch this movie! I am not a movie snob so be warned, of course I love amazing movies like There Will Be Blood, but I also like movies like the roommate and Pet sematary (all of them).\n\nSo all in all, these negative reviews are for die hard fans. But if you need a decent horror movie to watch you've never seen, give it a go. Definitely not a 3.5 out of 10 lol that's so ridiculous. I mean it's well made enough for at least a 5 from people who think it is a bad remake. Talk about sore losers."

If you don't think of it as a remake and just an independent movie then it's pretty amazing. The other reviews who rated it 1 or 2 stars only did that because it was a remake.\n\nThe acting is really good so I have no clue why everyone's saying it's bad. Because it's not. And the direction of the movie was good and there was really nothing wrong with the movie. It wasn't too gory and it had a good ending.\n\nThere are a few small plot twists, Like Helena. So if you've rated badly just because it's a remake then shut up."
