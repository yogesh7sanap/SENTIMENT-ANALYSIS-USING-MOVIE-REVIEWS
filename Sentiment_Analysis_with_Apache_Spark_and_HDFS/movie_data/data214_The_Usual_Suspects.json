        "review_detailed_main": "Out of the mind of Christorpher McQurrie comes this incredible story of a man in search of the devil. The film is called \" The Usual Suspects\" and what could be more appropriate than an unusual movie about five suspects who are anything but usual. The story originates with the only survivor of what the police conclude was a murderous and explosive drug deal gone bad. His name is Roger Kint (Kevin Spacey is perfect) also known as 'Verbal.' From the mouth of this innocent storytelling, con-artist comes the fantastic tale of how he and his fellow criminals, Stephen Baldwin, is Michael McManus, Benicio Del Toro is Fred Fenster and Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney were originally assembled and then set-up. Beginning with a mix-up by law enforcement to put several guilty men together in the same line up, the tale proceeds cross country and culminates with a powerful, but mysterious kingpin by the name of Keyser Soze. It's through his attorney, Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), the men learn they are marked for death unless they undertake a dangerous assignment. The center piece of the Unusual group is their leader, a remarkable individual named Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne, incredible performance). What transpires in this movie from moment to moment is a lesson in sleigh of hand. What we and the police Dave Kujan, (Chazz Palminteri) are told is not what we see. Conversely, what we see is not what we have been told. In the end, this film with it's haunting theme by John Ottman, is nothing short of incredible. A superb classic in both mystery and action entertainment, by Bryan Singer. A great film indeed. ****"

        "review_detailed_main": "Ah, the Usual Suspects. My personal favorite movie of all time. Don't let my bias be a fool. Perhaps it's not THE best movie ever, but it's one that I never get tired of.\n\nIf you like flash and bikinis and breath-taking camera angles, you won't find them here. Usual Suspects is not an \"epic,\" and it doesn't pretend to be. It's a modestly-budgeted piece by a fresh director (who later went on to do the X-Men movies, a FAR departure).\n\nA great, gritty script, beautifully-acted characters, and what many have called the greatest movie ending of all time, are some of the shining qualities that make the Usual Suspects an object worthy of praise above its humble-looking shell.\n\nThe casting is very unusual but somehow fits perfectly. Gabriel Byrne is convincing as the ex-con trying to build a new life when he gets drawn back into his old life. Stephen Baldwin has the role of his career as the smart-mouthed and cocky professional. Kevin Pollak takes a big departure from his usual good comedy self to take a more dramatic role. Benicio del Toro literally takes a one-dimensional character with absolutely nothing in the script to give him character, and he fleshes it out with brilliant mannerisms and memorable mumbling to show incredible acting creativity. Kevin Spacey as we know him was born from this movie. His manners and fast-talking yet shy gimp nature are a treat to listen to throughout the flick.\n\nWithout giving away the plot, the best and most genius parts of the movie are the subtleties. After you see the ending, and the truth hits you like a ton of bricks, you have to watch it again. On the second time through, you'll jump up and point at the screen whenever you spot a clue you missed the first time. It's even possible to watch the movie multiple times and see something new with every viewing. It's that attention to detail that make the deceptively innocent-looking Usual Suspects one of the greatest movies of all time."

        "review_title": "the American thriller of the nineties",
        "review_detailed_main": "One day in a bookshop, I flipped through a book entitled: \"the movies of the nineties\" and this movie wasn't included! How can a book specialized in cinema skip such a milestone of the last decade? Any movie buff, any cinema critic must have considered the nineties a fruitful era for the American thriller. According to one's tastes, some will say that the best thriller of the nineties is \"Silence of the Lambs\" (1991). For others it will be \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994) while others will praise to the skies \"Se7en\" (1995). For me, the pinnacle is this present movie, \"the Usual Suspects\" (1995) with its staggering story (to put it mildly). It's a sensational debut for Bryan Singer which enabled to put him on the map. With a little help from his accomplice Christopher McQuarrie, he signed an unparalleled gem in the landscape of the American thriller, even the whole cinema.\n\nThe average viewer who watches \"the Usual Suspects\" for the first time might think that the whole crew concocted him a meandering story with as a leading thread, Spacey's convoluted story. At the end of the projection, he may feel puzzled and will probably wish to watch the movie a second time. He won't regret it and Singer and McQuarrie will rejoice at it. Their masterwork gains by several repeated viewings to appreciate the subtleties of a rich movie with a convoluted construction which will take its seemingly definitive form in the five last minutes. To watch \"the Usual Suspects\" is like gathering the pieces of an intriguing puzzle, a little like any other suspenseful movie but in the case of Singer's flick, one will never really be able to completely end it. So many things happen in less than two hours that we are never really sure of what we watch and this is reinforced by a breathtaking unexpected twist at the end which makes our assumptions falter. Singer and McQuarrie take a mischievous delight in taking the viewer in their nebulous scenario and to follow it according to Spacey's declarations and it's obvious that they raise more questions than answers. It's up to the viewer to make his imagination work and to bring his thoughts on the film. This is what inspires its pernicious charm.\n\nFrom Spacey's story, the authors developed a top quality script, set with clockwork precision. Singer's directorial style virtually evolutes on the razor's edge and conveys an increasing tension. It is filled with ingenious visual ideas and served by fluid camera movements. Singer was in his early thirties when he shot his film but it presents the signs of a seasoned author. There's also a tight editing and a unsettling score which cement the movie in its place of winner. More remarkable, the authors pull off with gusto to increase the audience's curiosity throughout the film in spite of a somewhat deliberate confusion and the interest won't weaken until the end which constitute the apex: an unexpected twist which will leave the audience speechless once they understood it. In Singer's flick, it doesn't disappoint because there are little but noticeable visual and verbal clues which justify it. However, it has something unsettling. We believe that we are at the end of the maze but there's more to the picture than meets the eye. Maybe this \"coup de theatre\" veils one more truth. Maybe also the shrewdest ones will have guessed it but the result is the same for any viewer: Singer puts a baffled spectator in his pocket.\n\nSinger and Quarrie show a perfect master in the domain of the film noir: an ominous atmosphere, nocturnal scenes which stay rooted in the mind and a deep psychology of certain characters which give more substance to the film. Considering the last point, the character of Gabriel Byrne is the most interesting one: a former crooked cop who seemingly redeemed himself in catering but caught up by his past and forced to come back to work. I personally think that Byrne is the stand-out of the topflight cast the movie boasts. But don't neglect the other members. Kevin Spacey pocketed a deservedly Oscar in 1996 and the rest of the cast doesn't stay on the bench. Maybe Singer grants a little shallow attention to the three others baddies in the gang but in a way it's necessary to underscore the fact that they're lousy gangsters embroiled in a infernal spiral and unable to perceive what lies beneath all this. Pete Postlewhaite and Chazz Palminteri make their scenes count too.\n\nA riveting storytelling, a painstaking flash-back, a tight and first-class directing, a thoughtful twist, a topnotch cast, \"the Usual Suspects\" includes almost everything a director would sell his soul for. Everything contributes to make it a stalwart model in the suspenseful movie and the whole cinema. After the first vision, be prepared for mental gymnastics and for a second screening..."

Just when you think you know all, they pull the rug from under you, and make you think again. Direction is taut, the script is impressive.\n\nI would argue this is one of Spacey's best ever performances, if not the best of the lot, he is phenomenal here, and really does stand out in a crowd of immense talent, hopefully he'll get his career back on track.\n\nGabriel Byrne and Pete Postlethwaite shine, as does Stephen Baldwin, a time where that handsome brotherhood seemed to pop up everywhere, but he was excellent also.\n\nIt's a super slick production, with some pretty fine special effects, and good use of pyrotechnics, a polished production, one that's not overdone.\n\nThis is one of those movies that you can watch and watch again, it simply doesn't diminish or lose any of its intrigue. You know there's a twist coming, you'll sit there waiting for it, and the first time round your jaw may drop, it's a very well delivered moment. The ending of this film is fabulous.\n\n10/10."

While this film was unique and captivating, no other mystery will ever accomplish this sort of cult status, single handedly shaping a genre. While most mysteries try to shock you too often with twists and even more twists, it turns out to be overkill. This film encompassed such ideas with flair and originality, which is probably the reason Brian Singer is sticking to sci-fi action films. Only Memento and The Game are the only recent mystery movies worthy enough to stand beside this film. Sadly, Singer has somewhat sold out by doing the X-Men movies, but I guess trying to make films like this would be too taxing. This film will always bring a smile to my face when I watch it with someone who hasn't seen this movie. A good viewing every time I watch it, the new special edition DVD is awesome."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Usual Suspects only works because of its infamous twist ending. Until then, it is simply a convoluted mess that does not offer any ways to resolve its twisting and unreliable plot threads. Films with plot twists work well if they are enjoyable up until the revelation, like The Sixth Sense (1999) or The Prestige (2006). They offer enough mystery to tease a potential revelation and enough clues to figure it out. The Usual Suspects, however, revels in sheer incomprehensibility and hollowness that necessarily demands an explanation to appreciate even at a basic level. Even afterwards, the revelation clearly exists more for the audience's emotional reaction rather than making any sense within the scenario of the film. Gimmicky storytelling aside, the acting, production values and sense of suspense were all handled quite well for a low budget film."

I was excited 'The Usual Suspects' is a mystery film about what cargo was on board the ship when it was destroyed and the events leading up to it as we are told from the only known survivor of that accident.\n\nAround 45-50 minutes into the movie, I was starting to find myself a bit tired and thought the movie may perhaps have dragged along just a bit. I was becoming rather disappointed. Then the film truly began to change in such a way that I find it rather hard to explain. The characters began to get a little more entertaining, the pacing certainly began to pick up, the dialogue was getting more interesting and overall, I was more excited.\n\nThen comes the amazing final twenty minutes with the plot twist and the story finally closing in perfectly, making the story more understandable. However, the final 5 minutes of the movie are some of the best moments of movie ever made and that is the ultimate plot twist which surprised the hell out of me! It was a cheering end to what ended as a great movie and a movie I would be more than happy to check out again and again! A-"

        "review_detailed_main": "Boasting petty criminal characters conceived so brilliantly they achieve near-mythological status, The Usual Suspects is known for riveting suspense and action, an intriguing plot line and a jaw- dropping twist at the end. It also features some of the most memorable lines of the 1990s: \"How do you shoot the devil in the back--what if you miss?\" The characters, Roger \"Verbal\" Kint (Kevin Spacey), Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) and Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) have real character details and cues.\n\nThe film is set in the aftermath of a ship fire that totally burns the cargo and crew. Though meek and disabled, Verbal is the only survivor to walk away from the incident unscathed. He is taken into custody and grilled by the police. Brilliantly played in a characteristic, understated style that earned Spacey an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, Verbal is cleared and allowed to leave. But before he can go, agent Kujan from US Customs shows up to interrogate him. Kujan is trying to build a case against Keaton and he wants Verbal to testify in exchange for immunity. Verbal refuses, but Kujan still bullies Verbal into recounting his story of Keaton, McManus, Fenster and Hockney, leading up to the explosion on the ship.\n\nWhat follows is a fantastic yarn of lies and half-truths sprinkled within the facts of the case. It is all masterfully portrayed as a series of flashbacks while Verbal and Kujan sip coffee and talk in the LA police station. The story begins six weeks earlier in New York City as Verbal and the other four criminals are brought in to stand side-by-side in a police lineup. None of them are formally charged with a crime, and there are indications Keaton has actually gone straight prior to the roundup. But before they are released, the five hatch a plan to get revenge on the corrupt NYPD and make a large sum of money in the process by robbing a police-protected jewel smuggler and leaking news of the police involvement to the press. Keaton is reluctant and must be coaxed into it with the promise that no one will be killed in the heist. He agrees and the quintet pulls off the robbery to perfection. The acting and writing take chances that pay off, with each actor fully immersing himself in his role. Del Toro creates a uniquely colorful persona in his portrayal of Fenster, Baldwin conveys a reckless abandon and lust for violence, Pollak shows steely courage and resolve, Byrne is a complex mesh of toughness with motives pulling him in all directions. Each actor is at the top of his game.\n\nThe five criminals go to Los Angeles to lay low in the aftermath of the New York heist. There, they are enticed into another robbery that is also supposed to involve no killing. Unfortunately, this LA heist goes horribly wrong. As Verbal recounts this carnage, its aftermath and the growing problems and hostility in the crew, agent Kujan receives a tip from one of his colleagues who has a survivor pulled from the water near the charred wreckage of the ship. The witness is badly burned and cannot speak English, but insists that the man responsible for the destruction of life and property on the ship is named Kaiser Soze.\n\nWhether it is attributable to lies in Verbal's yarn or odd casting decisions, several characters in The Usual Suspects add to the film's mystique. Chief among these is the Irish Postlethwaite cast as the Japanese Kobayashi. There is a strong clue at the end that the name Kobayashi is used solely to mislead Kujan. But Kobayashi is not the only instance of a character's name failing to match his appearance. Another example is McManus' contact in LA, Redfoot, which one would expect to be the name of a Native American. But Redfoot appears to be caucasian. Again, at the end there is an indication that Verbal used Redfoot to avoid giving Kujan a real name. Strange ethnic inconsistencies crop up constantly. Kaiser Soze is said to be Turkish, possibly with a German father. These mixed-up character portraits add a layer of complexity to the plot, but one must always consider the source, Verbal Kint, and his motives.\n\nThe dynamic between Kujan and Verbal itself is pure entertainment. A kind of cat-and-mouse game, nuances are thrown into the proceedings that make it more interesting and add depth to the characters. Even the way the interrogation is filmed is unique. Verbal didn't achieve his nickname for no reason. He knows how to run his mouth and Kujan has a difficult challenge in corralling him. Underlying the interrogation is Kujan's suspicion of Keaton and his belief that Keaton manipulated Verbal. But Verbal is hard to pin down and Kujan occasionally resorts to bully tactics. But who is Kaiser Soze? Did he orchestrate the police lineup in New York, and pull all the strings ever since? Is the cargo of the ship drugs or only human cargo? Why did Verbal survive unharmed while so many others did not? Did Keaton really die, as Verbal insists, or did he slip away, as Kujan believes? Is Verbal telling the truth? Much is revealed in the final moments of the film, which wash over the viewer like an enormous wave of recognition. Snippets of dialogue from earlier in the film are montaged over the complex score, providing spine-tingling clues about exactly what part of Verbal's yarn was fact and what was fiction. The final snippet of dialogue, followed by a fortissimo string finale is especially powerful: \"and like that...he was gone.\""

It stars Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Spacey, Kevin Pollack, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro, Chazz Palminteri, Pete Postlethwaite, Giancarlo Esposito and Dan Hedaya. Music is by John Ottman and cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel.\n\nHeld in an L.A. interrogation room, Verbal Kint (Spacey) attempts to convince the feds that a mythic crime lord, Keyser Soze, not only exists, but was also responsible for drawing him and his four partners into a multi-million dollar heist that ended with an explosion in San Pedro harbor - leaving few survivors.\n\nIt sort of sidled into movie theatres in 1995 with no fanfare or heralded notices. Yet it wasn't long before word of mouth got around that The Usual Suspects might actually be the must see film of the year. Fledgeling director and writer - Singer and McQuarrie - produce a masterclass of crime/mystery/noir plotting in a whirl of intricate plot shifts and deft sleights of hand.\n\nThe core essence of the story is simple, just who is Keyser Soze? His reputation is one of utter fear, he may even be the devil himself. What transpires throughout the film is a number of scenes told in flashback form and narrated by Kint as the cops put the heat on him.\n\nWe are introduced to the five criminals who make up the suspects of the title, where dialogue pings with machismo laced humour. The addition of Postlethwaite's Kobayashi character, one of Soze's harbinger's of doom, further ups the ante of the story's deliciously corkscrew intrigue.\n\nIt all builds to a climax that - has you pondering just what you have watched previously. Yet here's the key as to why the pic still holds up on repeat viewings, we have been outsmarted, for as we dive in and enjoy the across the board great perfs, we have been privy to something that will stand the test of time for the genre it sits in. The repeat viewings factor still, some decades later, is as strong as ever.\n\nThe advent of time and home format releases etc have only improved the pic's own mythical status. Behind the scenes egos and dislikes on set only add further strength to the characterisations, as does one main man thinking he himself must be Soze when in fact he was way off. There's a trail of clues in the film that will reveal who Soze is - who knew!? - and on it goes. The Usual Suspects is the filmic gift that keeps on giving. 10/10"

For most of this, the audience is working hard to keep up with the characters and the story. It all makes sense but every once in a while, something sounds suspicious. When I first saw it in the theater, more than once it left me scratching my head. Then the twist comes, blows my mind, and explains all the suspicions I had.\n\nThe five men crew is played expertly by Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, Benicio Del Toro, and Stephen Baldwin. They are all acting at the top of their games. They needed to be great to sell this noir crime drama. This is one of the best."

There's so much detail here that it definitely would benefit from more than just one viewing.\n\nThe entire cast gives wonderful performances, but Kevin Spacey stood out among the rest with a stunning performance. He stars as Verbal, and the entire film is based on his version of events.\n\nThis is the type of film where you very carefully have to pay attention to every detail, and every bit of dialogue. This will make you understand everything much better as it can be confusing if you don't follow closely. The film revolves around a group of criminals who came together to pull off an impossible job, and the events leading to that fateful night.\n\nThe characterization is excellent as we deal with five very different characters, and we're told about each character in a way we can make up our own minds whether we're rooting for them or not. The writing really is fantastic, with good dialogue - and funny even! And then there's the mysterious Keyser S\u00f6ze. Is he real, or a myth? No spoilers here, so you're going to have to find out for yourself!"

Is Verbal Kint actually Keyzer Soze? Or is Verbal Kint one of Keyzer Soze's men. Or did Verbal use the myth of Keyzer Soze to get away? Or is Kobayashi Keyzer Soze? Even Keaton could be Keyzer Soze? It's not definitive. This film is a high achievement, it entertains with dialogue, flashbacks, suspense, shocking moments of realization followed by more shocking moments of realization. Most of the plot relys on the flashbacks told by Verbal Kint, leaving the audience stunned after viewing it. As Keyzer Soze is the myth the criminals fear, and may or may not be real."

        "review_title": "MOST Definitely... NOT Your \"USUAL\" Movie!",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Usual Suspects\" certainly defies pigeon holing or labeling! Its larger-than-life allure results from a seamless blending of elements: Psychodrama, Action, Suspense and Mystery, all built on intricate storytelling, a dynamic screenplay and taught direction, by Bryan Singer. The aforementioned are all bolstered by credible in-depth character development, brought to life by an outstanding cast, who flesh out each role to chilling near perfection. (Kevin Spacey, seen here before most people would have recognized his name, received an Oscar for his \"supporting\" role!)\n\nBut let's not get sidetracked. More than anything else,\"SUSPECTS\" is about the unparalleled unsettling reaction you get from viewing it! From the first scene to the end credits, it gets a headlock on your psyche, while sending the pit of your stomach into endless free fall! The only way to illustrate this, without giving away any key elements of the film, is a detailed look at the opening scene....a peerless example of instant timeless classic film noir.\n\nOn a boat, docked in San Pedro Harbor, the dying sole-survivor of an apparently devastating bloodbath shootout, painfully ignites a thin trail of gasoline. His obvious intention: Destroy EVERYTHING...himself included! From a deck higher up, an unseen someone pisses out the trail of flames.\n\nThe shadowy figure then casually walks down the stairs with an unhurried deliberation and saunters over to the agonizing man he has just saved. They exchange somewhat forced greetings and a few disjointed words of banter.\n\nWithout warning, the intruder firmly raises a pistol, his unblinking gaze reflected in eyes locked in contact with his own. Unhesitatingly, he fires two consecutive shots. A brief pause of contemplation ends when he casually lights a cigarette, strategically dropping his lighter to rekindle the liquid fuse, and then beats a hasty off-board retreat.\n\nWhat better way to introduce a character whose twisted iron resolve is so perverse, so deranged, that he saves a doomed man seconds before certain death, solely for the unmitigated pleasure derived from looking him squarely in the eye, his victim looking right back, while pulling the trigger himself. Without uttering a syllable, his actions shout out, \"I piss on you and your puny existence!\" His victim's final moments are thusly converted into a living/dying testimony, clearly demonstrating who it is that decides the particulars of when and how he will die!\n\n\"SUSPECTS\" has been severely critiqued by a vocal minority (to paraphrase another reviewer) for not knowing the difference between a plot twist and a non sequitur. With all due respect to the reviewer, who painstakingly highlighted the difference for us, perhaps a careful second viewing would shed some light on the source of this common confusion. After watching \"SUSPECTS\" four times making every effort to employ my most discerning eye, I am convinced the true genius of the movie hinges on this particular point!\n\nLet me underscore my unequivocal recommendation of this film with a special note to those of you who avoid the Action or Suspense genre because of your distaste of the excessive violence that generally characterizes them. Well, THIS IS NO Robert Rodriguez FILM! A lot of the scenes are done in the \"Old School\" style, where the violence is kept off-screen.\n\nAlthough there is considerable TALK in \"SUSPECTS\" about some of the most dastardly deeds imaginable, virtually none of this is graphically portrayed. So, PLEASE, if you have not seen it yet, because of this reason, I urge you to make an exception in this case...\n\n10* STARS! YOU MUST GET IT AND WATCH IT... CAREFULLY!!!"

I usually don't hand out perfect grades, but from beginning to end it takes you on a wild ride. And you will want to see it again to see if there are any \"tells\" you missed the first time. Somewhat like the fantastic \"Prestige\" of ten years later, except that was in the realm of magic and this is a thriller/heist film.\n\nFive guys who have absolutely nothing in common but a criminal background meet during a line-up over a hijacked truck full of gun parts and then team up in two different heists and then a third job on a boat. The first two heists they do willingly, the last job they are compelled to do. What do I mean by compelled ?- Watch and find out.\n\nThe first five minutes are confusing - You see two characters on a boat, one in full view, one whispering and seen only in shadowy profile. One shoots the other with the victim's seeming complete consent. The shadowy profile then sets the boat ablaze, escapes, and then the boat explodes. The film then starts out answering the question of what exactly it is you've just seen, and for that matter, what it is you haven't just seen.\n\nI wish I could say more, but I really can't without spoiling it, at least to a degree. With a brooding score full of regret, a first class ensemble cast, and the point being the power of story, I wouldn't suggest you watch this close to bedtime if you intend to sleep."

Six weeks ago, they met each other at the line-up in the police station and decide to team-up for a heist under the command of the former corrupt cop Keaton. After delivering the jewels to the fence Redfoot (Peter Greene), they are hired for another heist and then the lawyer Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) approaches to them and tell that the notorious Hungarian gangster Keyser S\u00f6ze had offered them to go to the ship to destroy the cocaine they are transporting. They go to the ship and do not find any drug, and Keyser S\u00f6ze killed each one of them. Who is Keyser S\u00f6ze?\n\nTwenty-two years after the releasing date, \"The Usual Suspects\" is still a great film that has not aged. The impact reduces a little if the viewer still recalls who Keyser S\u00f6ze is, but the film is still one of the best of the genre. Kevin Spacey was not well-known and Bryan Singer was in the beginning of his career, but the direction and performances are top-notch. The screenplay is one of the best written in the cinema history for a mystery film and the result is a fantastic movie. My vote is nine.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Os Suspeitos\""

With its intricate plot and masterfully woven narrative, the film keeps viewers on the edge of their seats, expertly balancing tension and intrigue.\n\nThe story unfolds through the perspective of Roger \"Verbal\" Kint, played exceptionally by Kevin Spacey, who recounts the details of a shocking crime to a police interrogator. As Kint, a small-time con artist, spins his tale, the film artfully reveals layers of deception and misdirection that keep the audience guessing until the very end.\n\nThe screenplay, penned by Christopher McQuarrie, is tightly constructed, filled with clever dialogue and unexpected twists that challenge the viewer's perception of reality. The performances are stellar, with an ensemble cast featuring Gabriel Byrne, Benicio del Toro, Kevin Spacey, and Chazz Palminteri, each bringing depth to their roles and contributing to the film's overall tension.\n\nVisually, the film employs a gritty aesthetic that complements the story's dark themes. The direction by Singer, combined with a haunting score, amplifies the suspense and pulls the audience deeper into the convoluted plot.\n\n*The Usual Suspects* is more than just a typical crime thriller; it's a labyrinth of manipulation, exploring themes of loyalty and betrayal. Its iconic ending and meticulous storytelling have left an indelible mark on cinema, making it a must-watch for anyone who appreciates expertly crafted suspense and character-driven narratives. Highly recommended for fans of clever mysteries and cinematic twists."

The police interrogate the witness and hear an unbelievable tale of a drug kingpin and a band of misfits who come together to pull off a heist like the department has never heard of...\n\nThis movie is directed by Bryan Singer (X-Men) and stars Kevin Spacey (House of Cards), Gabriel Byrne (End of Days), Chazz Palminteri (A Bronx Tale), Stephen Baldwin (Fred Clause), Benicio Del Toro (Crash) and Pete Postlethwaite (The Town).\n\nThe storyline and characters for this picture is brilliantly written and presented to the audience in a perfectly paced manner. The cast is well selected and everyone executed their character perfectly, especially Spacey who delivers my all time favorite performance of his. The sub plots were very well developed and presented to the audience and police officers. The interrogation scenes are so good. The soundtrack is also epic and the conclusion is cinematic gold.\n\nOverall this is a masterpiece and an easy 10/10. I would strongly recommend seeing this."

Fully deserving of its reputation as one of the best modern, and perhaps overall, films ever made. Not everybody is going to disagree and that is fine.\n\n'The Usual Suspects' is slickly and audaciously made, filmed with a lot of style and is atmospherically directed. It is also hauntingly scored. It is intricately and intelligently written by Christopher McQuarrie, some of the best screen-writing he ever did. It is beautifully and deftly directed by Bryan Singer. If remembered correctly, neither McQuarrie or Singer were well known at the time and it was 'The Usual Suspects' that put them on the map.\n\nFilm is famous for the iconic line-up scene, the noticeboard that haunts everybody forever and its killer twist, one for the ages and not one to forget in the long one. Twists have wildly varied in film, there are some ingenious ones but also some naff ones, 'The Usual Suspects' is one of the ingenious ones. 'The Usual Suspects' as said before doesn't just have its twist going for it. The flashback-packed story is similarly intricate and never feels muddled or convoluted.\n\nIt has some of the finest ensemble acting there has ever been. This is especially true for a mesmerising Kevin Spacey in one of the most deserved Oscar Wins that year. Spacey is just one of the all round brilliant performances. Pete Postelthwaite, an always dependable actor who is still very much missed, is suitably mysterious, and Dan Hedaya and Chazz Palminteri make their mark as the confused cops. Steven Baldwin doesn't have a particularly challenging role but has never been better, Gabriel Byrne is also solid.\n\nOverall, magnificent film in every sense. Recommended with no hesitation. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

Kevin Spacey's performance of Verbal deserves the Academy Award that it won for Best Supporting Actor in 1996; I would consider it one of the best performances of a character in film history. Brilliant execution from the rest of the cast, each bringing their piece to the table. There were notable standalone scenes that have been valuable to the success of this production, and I loved every part of it. Thank you, Christopher McQuarrie, for writing this gem."

Just like I said before, if you don't pay attention you will get lost in the story. Probably one of the best movie endings I've ever seen in my life without exaggeration. Of course I couldn't help but comment on the plot twist, probably one of the best I've ever seen but I won't say what it is, I'll leave it for you to see \ud83d\ude09.

Plenty of twists and turns, with the ultimate twist being what makes this film so entertaining when realising for the first time or rewatching and knowing all along, making the movie that more impressive.\n\nStephen Baldwins performance as 'Micheal McManus' was funny and entertaining. Learning that the lineup scene was unscripted made watching it so much more entertaining. This was also the case with Benicio Del Toro's 'Fred Fenster' character whose brilliant mannerisms and memorable lines shows top tier acting.\n\nThis film made Kevin Spacey, his performance as 'Verbal' was interesting and iconic, making the ultimate twist that more satisfying to watch. Admittedly, this film would not be as good as it is without the twist but to think this is to be in denial that this is an incredible film with a great script and praiseworthy performances by a great cast.\n\nI would give this film a more accurate 8.4/10, definitely worth a watch for one of the greatest twists in movie history."

From start to finish, it grips you with its masterful storytelling, breathtaking performances, and mind-bending twists and turns.

I won't spoil it here, but suffice it to say that it will leave you stunned, amazed, and wanting to watch the film all over again just to catch every little detail you may have missed.\n\nOverall, \"The Usual Suspects\" is a true cinematic masterpiece that is not to be missed.

        "review_detailed_main": "A different gangster story.\n\nI watched the film with an open mind. I did not watch the trailer or read the plot. After watching 'The Usual Suspects', I can now say it is now one of my favourite films.\n\nI was confused at the beginning; the film switches from the past to the present so often which made it difficult to follow. They lay out the backstory and how the group forms quickly; this gives the viewer context and the film is able to jump straight into the story. Pacing is one of the film's fortes; it moves swiftly with not a tedious moment. We are introduced to the characters and their backstories instantly. The main focus of the film then moves to a police interview between Verbal (Kevin Spacey) and Dave Kujan (Chazz Palmintetri). This is the narrative. Everything that happens is explained through this interview.\n\nThe story is compelling and entertaining right from the start. With an amazing performance from Kevin Spacey. We are taken through many sequences in which we see the characters' relationships build and the plot slowly builds up to a climax. The characters seem to develop close relationships; they form trust, friendship and a sense of love between each other. Ultimately, the character development is something that also stands out to me. As the film progresses the characters become more likeable. Developing the plot further through every story told, we are introduced to the bigger picture of how their gang works.\n\nThe cinematography matches the film very well as does the colouring. It gives the film a mysterious effect whilst giving it a dark aesthetic that matches the tone. The mood shifts around the middle when we are introduced to a character: Keyser Soze. He is portrayed as a demonic figure, someone everyone should fear. The Usual Suspects are made to do a job for him. Infiltrating a drug trade (this is the climax) is the final scene where everything happens.\n\nThe final sequences are exciting and engaging with the big question being asked: who is Keyser Soze? No one knew. As anyone who knew his identity would be killed immediately. As the interview between Verbal and Dave slowly comes to an end, a very big plot twist is revealed and it leaves us questioning everything about the whole story. The film then ends with perhaps one of the best lines in cinema history: \"The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he wasn't real\"."

Every one of these guys went on to have a great career. I wish they had the budget to do these mid budget feature films nowadays. It makes me sad that the death of DVD killed the mid budget level movie. The only movies they make nowadays are the big tent, pole movies, or the super mini budget that a studio has nothing to do with. In other words, someone's grandma paid for the film and you're praying that it comes out OK. Classic films that will never be made again."

He's an English guy and i think it's mentioned in the movie that he is English/British. I just couldn't make out where the accent was supposed to be from and why he would have it, so you think he may be Soze? Turkish nationality? Before i leave i want to say i really love this movie, but let's think about the plot for a moment. This is Soze's plan all along to get rid of an eye witness on board the vessil right? He goes to ALL that trouble to shoot the witness and in the end the police, everyone knows what Soze looks like anyway as they had the sketch faxed while he was being questioned. Why, if he was so smart and calculating, would he risk all of this to almost be caught in the very end?"

Not only does subtlety reduce the ridiculous amount of \"in-your-face-quality\" that today's thrillers seem to love, which effectively makes then just plain old action movies, subtlety shows that a film has respect for its audience. It doesn't feel like it has to explain everything at every step of the way since it knows that an interested audience will be on the lookout for hints as to what is going on. That's what makes films like this enjoyable. In fact, that what makes any film enjoyable. It isn't just a barrage of images, but rather an engaging sequence of them. This sequence can be unchronologically organized or in any number of ways obscured to create suspense, but as long as it is engaging, the audience will be happy.\n\n\"The Usual Suspects\" is such a thriller. It can be enjoyed with the eyes as much as the brain. There are numerous hints as to what is really going on and the final climatic twist is really a great one. Even then, upon seeing the whole film, the second viewing only gets better as that is when a keen viewer will pick up on all those subtleties that hint at the result which they are now familiar with. These subtleties are not just obscurely placed props but are woven into the film's montage with clever camera angles along with certain key objects seen on screen. It is a thriller worthy of Hitchcock or the best of DePalma. Nothing is in needless excess and even the profanity is well written and there are no pointless macho wisecracks. Simply put, everything works in this movie. And it works very well. Even upon multiple viewings the film captivates with its clever composition and that can only be a good sign. --- 10/10\n\nRated R for violence and profanity. Ages 13+"

And I will say, it's very difficult to discuss the film at any length without giving away the ending. The script is good, the visuals are fantastic at points (that shot of the shattering coffee mug will live rent-free in my head for quite some time), and the acting is pretty spot on. You can tell these boys had a fun time making this movie. I will say though-some gripes that I'm not faulting the movie itself for, since it was made in 1995-it's difficult in the year 2022 to watch a movie with so much unchecked casual homophobia, and it's genuinely a little hard to differentiate five individual main characters when they are all white men.\n\nAll told, though, this movie is good. As a screenwriter myself, I'm definitely taking notes on how to craft a satisfying ending that ties just enough up to be satisfying and still leaves you with a lot of questions. The last 15 minutes of the film alone are worth the price of admission. I'll be curious to watch it a second time knowing the ending and see what I pick up on that I didn't on this first time through."

To start, the plot alone is intelligent and baffling, so much that the general public is challenged to piece together a seemingly surrealistic account of mystery and murder. However, there's more to this movie than just the mere genius behind the plot. For starters, the cinematography, editing, and acting are captured perfectly to not only portray a story, but involve the audience as though they were to experience the story themselves. Additionally, the actors are brilliant and capture each character as precise as necessary to accurately forshadow the climactic point of the movie that leaves audiences breathless.\n\nHowever, behind the brilliance of the film, the editing, the acting, the storyline, the script, and the cinematography; are the ingenious facts hidden within the movie's composition. The antagonist himself was based off of a real-life serial murderer, whose actions are depicted in the film under alternative pretenses.\n\nIn all, this movie portrays the perfection of cinematography and should be the precedent that movie-makers strive to achieve."

        "review_detailed_main": "Five hoodlums are hauled into a police station in a dragnet roundup of The Usual Suspects that are brought in for questioning when something big breaks. Good chance any one or all could have been involved. If you remember in the film The Brink's Job, there is a scene where within a day a lot of Boston's known hoodlums are brought in for questioning. The dragnet brought in Stephen Baldwin, Bernicio DelToro, Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, and Kevin Pollak. From this motley crew a gang is born.\n\nFlash forward to several years later when there is a horrific fire on board a freighter where there has been a gun battle with many deaths. Kevin Spacey managed to survive along with two others of the freighter crew and is being questioned in the police station by US Customs Agent Chazz Palmenteri and LA cop Dan Hedaya.\n\nAfter a couple of other jobs, this crew winds up working for a criminal mastermind from the Balkans who is known as Keyser Sose who is known to be so ruthless that the criminal population itself is scared to death. This guy is spoken of like he was Satan himself and of course the police want him big time also.\n\nI can't say much more because the plotting of The Usual Suspects is so intricate and filled with unexpected twists that to spoil this film would be a crime itself. Some here like Stephen Baldwin give their best performances on screen. Kevin Spacey won his first Oscar, this one in the Best Supporting Actor category. The category has me stumped because it's his character that's the key to the whole film. The other Oscar The Usual Suspects won was for Christopher McQuarrie for one highly original Screenplay.\n\nThe Usual Suspects has enough action for those who crave that, especially when we do see the final battle on that freighter and it's also some highly literate dialog for those who appreciate that. It's best compared to that granddaddy of all caper films The Asphalt Jungle, it's that good."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's a crime movie set in the 1990s in New York City and Los Angeles, California. It rests almost entirely on the plot rather than on developed characters. It follows five criminals who seem to be thrown together by circumstance. Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin) and Fred Fenster (Benicio del Toro) are two hardened criminals who have worked together for five years. Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollack) is a loner. Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) is a former bent cop who spent five years in prison and continued in crime but is now trying to escape the underworld because of his lawyer girlfriend, Edie Finneran (Suzy Amis). The fifth hood is a seemingly low-level con man, Roger \"Verbal\" Kint (Kevin Spacey), who limps because of a twisted foot and crippled hand.\n\nCrooked cops set up the five for a crime in New York City, but they are released. They take revenge against the police and head to California to fence the jewelry they stole. There, they encounter a fence named Redfoot (Peter Greene), a lawyer named Kobayashi (Peter Postlethwaite), and hear of a Turkish crime godfather named Kayser S\u00f6ze, who involves them in a climactic caper that results in 27 deaths, and only one of the five survives. As the only survivor, Verbal Kint is interviewed by LAPD Sgt: Jeff Rabin (Dan Hedaya) and Federal agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri). The film follows this interview, interspersed with flashbacks to events going back to New York City. Verbal spins a very complex story to Kujan, who leads the interrogation. The movie's ending reframes everyone's assumptions about what has just been seen.\n\n\"The Usual Suspects\" is an entertaining, if unbelievable plot. Spacey is excellent as the \"everyman\" who is not what he appears to be. One reviewer compared this film to \"Pulp Fiction,\" but it doesn't come close. In this film, the viewer needs to work to track the plot, and at the end, you scratch your head at gaping logical holes. But Spacey's performance under interrogation is worth a watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "A fine example of a movie trying really hard to be a Rubik's Cube. When a movie starts tripping over itself just for the sake of complicating the plot--that's when I throw up my hands and say, \"Enough already!\" It stops being entertaining and enjoyable and begins to be nothing but a chore. I tried to like this movie, but after being introduced to about 300 characters who all look and act alike (their names even rhyme, for God's sake!), and when the plot demands that we memorize all sorts of details about each one of them to follow the story, that when it stops being fun. I felt like I was working overtime just to keep up with this mess.\n\nWhen the ending is finally sprung, and I thought about it in the context of the rest of the movie, it should have all made sense, justifying the over-complicated story, but it didn't. Holes opened up large enough for houses to fall through. It seemed as if the writer just threw in the most unlikely possibility to astonish the audience. After the maze he leads us through, it's easy to forget why this doesn't make sense. It's a real cheap shot."

        "review_detailed_main": "A movie whose name is gotten from a line in the old classic, Casablanca \"The Usual Suspect\" is about an interrogation gone wrong. The movie is very hard to connect together, and the masterful twist ending for some did more harm than good, but for me it was the thriller of the whole movie. The fact that after the movie is over I still have to sit down and think about it, connecting the dots and wanting to have another re- run of the movie to be sure that I don't miss any dot, that is the reason why this movie is a master piece.\n\nWritten by Christopher McQuarrie, the Keyser S\u00f6ze character is based on the accounts of John List, an accountant who murdered his family in 1971 and then disappeared for almost 20 years by assuming a new identity before he was eventually apprehended in 1989. McQuarrie got the name Keyser S\u00f6ze from the name of his former supervisor Keyser Sume, and the last name S\u00f6ze is Turkish which is translated as \"talk too much.\"\n\nThe Interrogation scene was first shot and it ran for 6 days, and the rest of the movie was put together next and editing was the grand touch that made this mystery thriller that good a movie to see.\n\nThe movie plot is about the interrogation of a small time con man named Roger \"Verbal\" Kint (Kevin Spacey), who is a one of the only two survivors of a heist gone wrong that resulted to a fire on a ship. He tells the interrogator the series of events that led him and four other criminals to the boat.\n\nThis series of events are shown to the viewer in the form of flashbacks as Kint narrates his story to the over confident interrogator. As the story goes on and gets complex the interrogator connects the dots and explains the story better to Kint, only to get the shocker of his life when he releases Kint believing he was used by the other four.\n\nDone with a 6 million dollar production budget, the movie recouped its production cost and more; the well crafted screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie gained him an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and Kevin Spacey won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as the criminal Keyser S\u00f6ze.\n\nThe Usual suspect is a fine film, well developed to push the imaginations of the viewer, the unexpected ending is the cream on the top of this delicious masterpiece and one thing is sure, you will be asking for seconds after you are done seeing it the first time.\n\nwww.lagsreviews.com"

It's an airtight movie with so many small details and clues that create a sense of misdirection to the twist near the end, and the storytelling itself is amazing. And that twist gets twisted with more details and clues, ultimately making this the perfect crime/mystery. The comedy lands correctly when its needed. Every character is great, and the actors all sell their roles perfectly. I love this movie, and it's a major recommendation from me."

Don't get me wrong it was a very good film and I am glad I finally got the chance to see it but with critics going on and on about it, they kind of kill the magic of the movie. However that really did not hinder my enjoyment as I decided to treat this just like any other movie. Basic concept of 5 cons on various heist missions until one goes terribly wrong and then the authorities try to establish what went wrong hearing this from the account of one of the crippled crooks (Kevin Spacey). Gabreil Bryne was a excellent in his role as the lead crook and Benico Del Toro was also a stand out performance but we all know that Kevin Spacey was the man who took joy in playing the audience like a piano. A film can start of slow but the ending is the most important thing in the whole thing and I am glad to say that this ending was nothing short of a slap in the face.\n\nTHE USUAL SUSPECTS - 8.1 OUT 10\n\nTHE GREATEST TRICK THAT THE DEVIL EVER PULLED WAS CONVINCING THE WORLD THAT HE DOESN'T EXHIST AND JUST LIKE THAT.....

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a stylishly made, crime film noir with a surprisingly brilliant script that will literally sneak up on you in how detailed and creative it is. I think that word- creative- is what so many people like about this film. It takes risks and has the gall to stick to them, and that seems to be something that has tended to work in this genre with the favorites it generates.\n\nFor those who dismiss this as a one-watch film, they are sure missing out. I was one of the skeptics who felt it may not be rewatchable originally, but the truth is that the script writing is that good that it holds up in quality on repeat viewings.\n\nAnother misconception some have noted is that they have concluded that \"none of the story was true\", which is not the case at all. The detective is investigating the crime scene at the dock. He even details who was on the boat and how they were connected to the ringleader, the infamous Kaiser Soze.\n\nIn addition to the scriptwriting, this film uses understated and subtle music and camerawork that distinguishes it from a majority of other run-of-the-mill heist or crime films, but where it really excels is its handling of its mysteries, revelations, and its own mythology.\n\nWhen watching this film, you may enjoy the conventional crime suspense as you would in the genre, but what you may love is how it messes with your head. With so many remakes, clich\u00e9s, and dumbed down movies that have all been done before, real movie lovers sometimes have an innate desire for a film to totally screw with their head, and the way the Usual Suspects does it is not through horror, excess gore, or outlandish jump scares or CGI; it does it through intelligence, subtleties, and outstanding film editing overlapped with unforgettable musical scores that all can combine to send chills down your spine.\n\nBut to make it even more eerie and somewhat profound, it even includes classic lines like this: \"Dean Keaton once said, 'I don't believe in God, but I fear him. Well, I believe in God, and the only thing in this world that scares me is Kaiser Soze\" and \"The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.\"\n\nThis crime world blends elements from the underworlds of Argentina, Hungary, Russia, and elsewhere, as mythological, notorious villain, Kaiser Soze, makes chess moves around the globe to protect his assets, as well as his identity. His underlings handle all of his dirty work, as would likely be the case in the mob hierarchy, so there is definitely an element of realism within the story and script. But with his obscure existence, can Detective Kujan identify him with the help of the one person who may be able to finger him in a lineup?\n\nThis is a low budget, indie hit that won't be for everybody, but most fans of artistically-made original movies will probably like it. Strong performances by Chazz Palmieri, Gabrielle Byrne, Giancarlo Esposito, and Kevin Spacey, as well as a creatively strange one by Benicio Tel Toro carry this unusual entry to the crime thriller genre. Hold onto your hats."

There is one enormous surprise which I will not reveal to you, as it would ruin your viewing experience. But suffice it to say you will not figure out what it is. Del Toro, Byrne and Spacey give outstanding performances, and the writing of Chris McQuarrie is first-rate.\n\nSteve Baldwin is entertaining in his roles, but there is one actor who steals the show; and once again, I will not tell you who that actor is; it would spoil your enjoyment."

        "review_detailed_main": "******SPOILERS****** Highly overdone movie about a mass killing in a shoot-out and explosion of a ship docked at San Pedro Harbor with connections to a notorious Hungarian drug gang. As well as a crew of hoods recruited out of NYC who tried to rip the gang off of the 91 million dollars of coke on the ship. Added to that a mysterious mob kingpin who set up the whole operation, for very personal reasons, to use as cover for him to knock off a witness on the ship that was to be turned over by the gang to the FBI as a witness against him that could land the mob kingpin behind bars for life.\n\nAll this is seen in flashback, at the San Pedro Police Station, with Special US Customs Agent Dave Kujan, Chazz Palmintri, interviewing Roger Verbal (Kevin Spacey),the only survivor of this holocaust, for what seems like the time you would have sat through an old movie triple-feature with cartoons newsreels and coming attractions added on. We're bombarded by Verbal's story that goes on endlessly about how he and his fellow hoods were recruited by Mr. Kobayashi, Pete Postiethwaite, back in New York City some six weeks earlier to do a job for the mysterious Kayser Soze (?) ,whom they are told by Kobayashi that they are in debt to. Verbal goes on endlessly talking about this very strange and confusing plan that the Kayser concocted which in the end turns out to be an elaborate hit, by himself, of a protected government witness.\n\nYou would think if this Kayser Soze was as smart as the movie makes him out to be why didn't he or his mouthpiece, Kabayashi, tell these hoods just to knock off the witness instead of having all this killing going on at the San Pedro Harbor as well as all over the country with all of them ending up dead except Verbal? And even more important why did he, The Kayser, have to kill the witness himself leaving himself open to being killed or captured by the Hungarian drug gang as well as the recruited hoods themselves if they ever found out who he was, and what he was planing for them, or the police?\n\nAnother thing that doesn't make sense about the movie \"The Usual Suspects\" is that this Kayser Soze who is so unknown and secretive even to his fellow mobsters, it seemed that only Mr. Kobayashi knew just who he was, would be that well known by the FBI or local police to be identified and arrested? And who would their protected witness know who to finger if this Kayser Soze was so unidentifiable? What was so important about this person that the Kayser was dealing with, and wanted to knock off, that he would reveal his real identity and place of residents to him where he would blow the cover that he so painstakingly built up over the years? Was this individual involved in preparing the Kysers Federal and State Income Tax returns?\n\nEven at the end of the film when it was finally revealed just who the Kyser was you still didn't really know who he was since he was using an allies just like the name Kayser Soze itself obviously was. And even if the FBI and local police really knew who he was and where he was and went to arrest him would the murderous and cunning Kayser Soze just stay there and let himself be taken into custody? With all the avenues of escape and control with his mob's vast resources available to him?\n\nThe ending of the movie shocked you only because it seemed to make sense at the time that you were exposed to it but after getting over the shock and realizing just how irrational it was, as well as the whole film, you began to see that's all it really was: An end to the movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "For some reason, I didn't get round to seeing this film until quite recently (just one of those weird things). I was excited to finally see it since I'd heard so many people rave about it, but I have to say I was somewhat disappointed. Without question it is an entertaining, surprising, and well-acted film, but I can't see why it gets quite such high ratings on here.\n\nKevin Spacey does a fine job of playing the part of Verbal, and Gabriel Byrne is okay too, but otherwise there were no outstanding performances. Similarly, while the plot was clever, it was nothing that amazing, and I saw the twists coming a mile off. Unlike something like Reservoir Dogs, which gave the gangster film a much-needed injection of not taking itself seriously, the crims in The Usual Suspects are just the typical bad-boys-who-fancy-themselves. Also, maybe Americans can accept Pete Postlethwaite's bizarre accent and make-up, but for me it really detracted from the film - what WAS he supposed to be? Indian??? If so, why on earth didn't they get an Asian actor? Sorry, I don't mean to slag off a film that I know a lot of people really like, I'm just giving my honest opinions. I suspect if I'd seen it when it came out, I too would have found it an amazing groundbreaking piece of cinema, but IMHO it hasn't really stood the test of time.\n\nStill, it was a decent way to pass a couple of hours, so I've given it 7/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie was directed by Bryan Singer and was released in 1995. This is a great action, drama, mystery movie all wrapped up into one. It is a movie about five criminals that are well known in New York. These five criminals were initially brought in for a police lineup but then the movie really builds from there. These five criminals all vow to get back at the police force. This takes them on a journey of criminal activity. First they get back at the cops by exposing dirty cops. Then they start working other various jobs together. Then one turning point in the film is that they are called upon by Kaiser Sosa to take on a dangerous job. Kaiser Sozas character is then built as spooky, vicious underworld figure that even the most notorious criminals are afraid of.\n\nThere are five main characters that this movie is based around. Verbal Klint, played by Kevin Spacey is a crippled conman that doesn't like violence. Michael McManus, played by Stephen Baldwin, is a top level entry man that is deemed to be a little psychotic. Todd Hockney, played be Kevin Pollak, is a hardened criminal wise cracker. Fred Fenster, played by Benicio Del Toro, is a partner of Michael McManus. Dean Keaton, played by Gabriel Byrne, was and ex cop turned notorious crook.\n\nThe movie goes throw many flashbacks to give you pieces to the big puzzle that unfolds. There are many details in this movie and after watching it 30+ times I still don't understand all of it. Maybe Bryan Singer wanted it that way, to keep you intrigued and wondering.\n\nThe movie really was edited and directed in very sophisticated way. All scenes were masterfully directed. The lighting was great in various sense throughout the moving. This lighting really accentuated the scenes. All of these aspects gave the film a great visual style and a truly grandiouse feel.\n\nThis movie continually builds to the conclusion. In the end of the movie Kevin Spacey pulls off a great performance. He is being interrogated by agent Kujan. Verbal Klint is making up a very details story about what he is being interrogated about. As soon as Verbal is released Kujan realizes that he had been duped. Virbal then enlightens the viewers that he is the notorious non gimpy criminal called Kaiser Sosa.\n\nThis movie really doesn't have a parity that I am aware of. It is unique, intriguing and keeps you mentally engaged throughout the movie. One quote and really the central theme to this movie is: \"the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was to convince the world he didn't exist\"."

I felt like there was too much reliance on name dropping and intentional complications, which I guess fits in with the big twist at the very end, but that doesn't suddenly make it excusable. Tough to follow at many times, with some interesting storytelling experiments along the way; it's a good-to-very good story that often gets too caught up in itself."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is mysterious from the beginnig. Night on the deck of a ship strewn with bodies, apparently an aftermath of a shoot-out, a wounded man, who later we know is a criminal Keaton, resignedly looking up at a figure who he calls Keyser, then Keyser aims a gun at him, and bang, bang.\n\nThen it is exploring what has lead to the culmination. U.S. Customs agent Kujan sets up an unofficial investigation into a survivor Verbal, through whose statement we follow the series of events that he, Keaton and other three fellows went through for weeks.\n\nThe five men's mug-shot scene, six weeks before the ship and just after a truck-hijacking, is iconic. I already know in terms of plot, Keaton and Verbal are the main, and other three are something like supportive. But each man is equally attractive as a character. I love especially Fenster's babbling. And each man is a man who 'never bend over for anybody'.\n\nAfter released, the five men go on to the next heist, and next. But pursueing is somehow turning into being pursued and manipulated. A lawyer calling himself Kobayashi shows up, and alleges his employer is Keyser S\u00f6ze, who is told in the fearsome underground urben myth.\n\nThe plot is so complicated that you will hardly keep track of everything. But no matter how well you comprehend the plot, you will be drawn to the mystery anyway. As Keyser Soze's invisible influence is looming, their fate become desperate. This is a film noir, all about the misery of criminals, and that is poignant joy to us viewers.\n\nI'm sure it must have been very astonishing Kevin Spacey's acting as Verbal was, as he was much less known back then. His expression is interpretable as A or B, which in turn irritates Kujan, played by Chazz Palminteri, who is also excellent. It often uses close-up shots, and every character's close-up face is tight and powerful. The suspense will never loosen you up to the ending, one of the best ending scenes I've ever seen."

The writing is fantastic, with sharp dialogue and a well-crafted screenplay that makes for an engaging and thrilling watch.\n\nThe performances from the entire cast are outstanding, with Kevin Spacey giving, what is is my eyes, his career-defining performance. His subtle nuances and mannerisms add depth and intrigue to his character, and he delivers some of the film's most memorable lines. The rest of the cast especially Benicio Del Toro and Stephen Baldwin, all shine in their respective roles, with each bringing a unique energy and personality to their characters.\n\nThe directing by Bryan Singer is also brilliant, with his use of camera angles, lighting, and music hightening the tension and atmosphere of the film. The music is also excellent, its haunting melodies and intense percussion do a great job of adding to the film's suspenseful moments.\n\nOverall, this film is a brilliant and timeless classic that will continue to stand the test of time. Its intricate and clever storytelling, coupled with outstanding performances and direction, make it a must-see for any fan of crime and thriller movies. It is a solid 10 out of 10 and a true masterpiece of cinema in my opinion."

        "review_detailed_main": "Wait a minute... five criminals in one lineup? There's something wrong here, right? Right... In \"The Usual Suspects,\" not only every line but every gesture, every facial expression and every camera cut counts. Even if you distrust the story being told, you can't exactly pin down everything that's wrong with it. The plot unfolds through the tale extracted from Kint, one of two survivors of a massacre and subsequent explosion on a boat docked in San Pedro Harbor, by U.S. Customs agent David Kujan (Chazz Palminteri). And at the same time as Kint is spinning his yarn, in a nearby hospital the other survivor (badly injured and fresh out of a coma) helps a police sketch artist draw a picture of the mastermind behind the scheme - \"the devil,\" Keyser S\u00f6ze. You can watch this movie countless times, and you will still discover new subtleties every single time. Not only will you find that it still makes sense after the story line has been unraveled at the end (which therefore is a plot twist, not a non-sequitur). You'll also discover nuance upon nuance in Kevin Spacey's incredible performance. You'll see that tiny apologetic grin on Todd Hockney's face as attorney Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) lists a weapons truck heist - the very act which brought them together in the initial lineup, and which they have all come to believe to have been a trumped-up charge - as Hockney's latest sin against Keyser S\u00f6ze, now forming part of the debt to be repaid by participating in the suicide mission in San Pedro Harbor. And at some point you'll also have figured out all of Fenster's lines (not being a native English speaker, I am relieved to find that I wasn't the only one struggling with them at first)... although the mumbling is of course part of his character, and is as excellently delivered as every other aspect of Benicio del Toro's acting, his lines are so funny and to the point you almost wish he'd speak more clearly so you wouldn't miss half his punch lines the first time around.\n\nThis masterpiece of cinema deservedly won the best screenplay Oscar and best supporting actor Oscar for the wonderful Kevin Spacey in 1995. The film is a modern day classic with all the elements of great film making coming together. A fantastic script combined with brilliant direction and a cast that seemed to be thoroughly enjoying itself, this is 1940's film noir at its very best, brought thoroughly up to date for the 1990's, combining clever little references to the past with very modern settings at that time. Action, suspense, plotting, double crossing - the whole kit and kaboodle.\n\nOverall rating: 10 out of 10."

It is expertly shot, written, and acted. This movie, along with Seven, L.A.

He went on to win an Oscar for his performance in this movie, although I believe the only reason he won over Brad Pitt (12 Monkeys) that year was because he was also brilliant in Seven, but I digress. But, let's be honest for a moment. The real reason this movie is brilliant is because of the total knock-out ending. It is the kind of ending that pulls the rug out from under, and right as you stand up and figure out what happened, they do it again."

The beginning of the movie is a bit convoluted, but it resolves itself out as it goes on. The strongest part about the movie is that the climax doesn't feel either uncanny or unpredictable, and yet it still manages to pack a punch of surprise. This movie quite easily features one of the best storytelling mechanics, and ironically runs storytelling as its core plot point."

The twist is a classic, sending you back to the rest of the movie with all kinds of questions. I just wish those questions extended beyond the details of the plot or the nature of the plotting. As an enquiry into the nature of telling a story, it languishes in the remedial class, opting for a cute but rather cheap revelation rather than any serious interrogation into the nature of a thriller, which is what it seems to want to be.\n\nA good watch and never dull or dragging, but a movie which leaves me with a rather hollow feeling. Disappointing, particularly for something which came heaped with so much critical praise."

This is what really marks the film out as something special. The way the story unfolds and how it is told is very clever and entertaining, building towards a fantastic ending.\n\nSeveral elements and stylistic choices haven't aged awfully well in the 27 years since release, but this is a minor point.\n\nA terrific crime thriller."

        "review_detailed_main": "The problems with movies like \"The usual Suspects\" is that they are taken too seriously. People flock to identify a hidden meaning, a socially relevant message or a reflection of time when it was made. While a good movie may and, sometimes, does have one or more of these attributes, still the basic point of every good movie is to entertain. If the movie has involved me in it, made me suspend my disbelief to move along enthusiastically with the story, it has done its job. The Usual Suspects does just that. You may sit comfortably long after the movie is over and think about how some parts make no sense or are improbable. But, while watching it just sweeps you, partly because of its same improbability and also because of its pace. The pace is just right, not fast enough to make you lose track of what is happening, or slow enough to second-guess the motives and figure out the plot twists. The way the movie unfolded and ended was enough to keep me interested throughout. The ending is a classic, even if you guess it a little before you are expected. Of course, the delight in watching it the second time is immense as armed with the revelation at the end, you can view a lot of scenes with an investigative interest and come off totally consumed. Besides its plot, TUS has brilliant performances to keep you entertained and some great dialogs. It is one of those movies form which you can take nothing home, apart from the pleasure while watching it. I say, thats enough!!"

        "review_title": "Quite ingenious crime film that lets you in and then doesn't give you so much as a sniff unless you can spot all the visual clues and then some more.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Only a film as cryptic as The Usual Suspects could keep you coming back for more and more. A film that is so involved and so smart and engaging in its delivery that it drops several clues to its ending while simultaneously not entirely making them obvious for first time viewers. In fact the series of clues; ideas and the overall ending is so famous, it's been referenced and spoofed in so many other pieces of text that these days it would be almost impossible to watch without knowing what everything revolves around. The mere fact the ending and whole idea has featured in these other texts only confirms The Usual Suspects' cult status and is really just an appreciation or 'acceptance' that it is truly a fantastic film.\n\nThe film is an all over the place (in the nicest possible way), crime drenched neo-noir which cuts back and forth from police station to detective trying to get to the bottom of a supposed drug deal gone wrong on one equilibrium; but also to the flashbacks which are the making of the drug deal on another equilibrium. The film sees visual references, audio references, what characters do as well as general dialogue drop hints as to what is coming and what the truth really is \u0096 hell; in one instance, where a certain character looks is an important clue. But The Usual Suspects is more than a series of tricks and gimmicks masquerading under a decent cast and a well shot, well lit crime saga. It is a journey into a world of the detective; it is a race against time and it is a non-linear crime saga revolving around organised crime, criminals and drug lords.\n\nI have to admit that I didn't fully understand the film first time I saw it, but with the added aid of research and DVD extras, The Usual Suspects quickly became one of my favourite films in terms of atmosphere, narrative and the general pacing of the story being unfolded. The film also carries a certain air of manipulation and ambiguity in its presentation, forcing us to think one thing; forcing us to recognise with seemingly the most unnecessary things imaginable: the way a certain character speaks nearer the beginning; the direction a certain character looks and what they're looking at as well as what certain characters are telling other characters and how they're reacting to it despite the fact we've already seen it.\n\nIf it all sounds complicated then that's because it is, but that's the beauty of the film when it comes to multiple viewings. Everything is set up in a fast and urgent manner after a more sedate and much more calmer opening in which the aftermath of a shoot out on a boat introduces the prologue to the main strand of the film: an interrogation (or a 'friendly chat' according to the interrogating police man) between Verbal Kint (Spacey) and the officer, David Kujan (Palminteri). The brilliance in the delivery of Kint's story to Kujan lies in its parallel placing with the scenes revolving around the rounding up of the criminals which culminates in that famous line up shot; the developing of their friendship/hatred; the jobs that they do for a mysterious figure known as Redfoot (Greene) and the situation they all find themselves in once crime king Keyser S\u00f6ze (can't put actor's name in brackets) catches up with them.\n\nIf we look at how the criminals consisting of McManus (Baldwin); Keaton (Byrne); Fenster (del Toro); Hockney (Pollak) and Kint are rounded up in the first place, we can see that out of all the arrests Keaton's is given the most dramatic and most coveted. When he is arrested, he is in an expensive restaurant indulging in a rich conversation as opposed to the others whom are crudely rounded up on street corners and in garages. From here Keaton is made to look, perhaps not the most criminal, but certainly the most intelligent of the band but the rest of them are petty criminals or in Kint's case, crippled. This immediately places a higher opinion on Keaton in our minds and already, the film is attempting to brainwash us with its 'who's who'. The extensive dialogue later on constantly keeping Keaton in the dark as to who he could really be helps maintain this doubt as does his scrachy background and his failure to get a business empire off the ground.\n\nThen there is the manipulation of the supporting characters. I mentioned Redfoot being mysterious, something the film establishes with eerie music as his car rolls up to the gang. They meet amongst some odd looking Japanese mise-en-scene definitely un-associated with the location they're currently in: Los Angles, further adding to the bizarre and somewhat surreal nature of both the scene and the film. But there are several incidences where what you think was right, indeed wasn't and as the film develops things become increasingly dramatic culminating in a scene involving a notice board that still chills me even after so many viewings. Quite simply; The Usual Suspects is a smart and engaging film, the likes of which can be revisited time and time again."

Fully deserving of its reputation as one of the best modern, and perhaps overall, films ever made. Not everybody is going to disagree and that is fine.\n\n'The Usual Suspects' is slickly and audaciously made, filmed with a lot of style and is atmospherically directed. It is also hauntingly scored. It is intricately and intelligently written by Christopher McQuarrie, some of the best screen-writing he ever did. It is beautifully and deftly directed by Bryan Singer. If remembered correctly, neither McQuarrie or Singer were well known at the time and it was 'The Usual Suspects' that put them on the map.\n\nFilm is famous for the iconic line-up scene, the noticeboard that haunts everybody forever and its killer twist, one for the ages and not one to forget in the long one. Twists have wildly varied in film, there are some ingenious ones but also some naff ones, 'The Usual Suspects' is one of the ingenious ones. 'The Usual Suspects' as said before doesn't just have its twist going for it. The flashback-packed story is similarly intricate and never feels muddled or convoluted.\n\nIt has some of the finest ensemble acting there has ever been. This is especially true for a mesmerising Kevin Spacey in one of the most deserved Oscar Wins that year. Spacey is just one of the all round brilliant performances. Pete Postelthwaite, an always dependable actor who is still very much missed, is suitably mysterious, and Dan Hedaya and Chazz Palminteri make their mark as the confused cops. Steven Baldwin doesn't have a particularly challenging role but has never been better, Gabriel Byrne is also solid.\n\nOverall, magnificent film in every sense. Recommended with no hesitation."

Still, it's strangely compelling, and I'm always waiting for that ending to come again. For some reason, I feel it different every time, as if I keep finding clues that I missed in my last watch.\n\nKevin Spacey is great on this one, you end up feeling sorry for the guy at some point. The rest of the characters make a beautiful team, and I wish we had a little more banter between them. Especially by the Benicio del Toro character, who's totally nuts.\n\nThe movie looks great, especially considering its budget. The actions scenes are nicely done, it has awesome shots of the sun above the river and the city, disturbing flashbacks scenes, and cool dialog. The duration is perfect, it doesn't go overboard.\n\nA must see!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of my favorite movies. The acting is top-notch. The cast alone is a tip-off it's something special, featuring Spacey, Benicio del Toro, Gabriel Byrne and Chaz Palminteri. Even Stephen Baldwin turns in what might be his best ever performance. Then there are a number of perfectly cast character actors throughout.\n\nThe plot manages to remain gripping and grounded throughout, even with a series of unforeseeable twists and backstories that border on the realm of fantasy.\n\nIf you haven't yet seen this, I'm jealous! If you have seen it, in my own experience, it's just as enjoyable the second time.\n\nIn fact. I believe most people - like me, will want to watch it again. It was during my second viewing that I looked for and identified the subtle cues that are in there that point to the solution of the puzzle. Enjoy!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Thanks mainly to Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992), the 1990's saw the re-emergence of crime noir - talky, violent thrillers packed with colourful characters and even more colourful language. Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects was one of the best of the bunch, thanks mainly to the director taking influence from past masters such as Hitchcock, Lang and Kurosawa, rather than the many Tarantino copycats that flooded the 90's cinema market, who did little but poorly imitate the big-chinned one's chatty screenplays and outlandish, darkly humorous violence. It also had a killer twist; one that will baffle as much as it will surprise, or possibly induce cries of cheap manipulation.\n\nAfter what appears to be a heist gone wrong on an exploded boat, the only surviving witness, Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey), a disabled con-man, is brought in to be interrogated by customer officer Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri). Having already been acquitted by some mysterious higher powers, Kint is probed by Kujan for more information. He tells a story of five criminals who meets in a line-up - Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), a steely criminal gone straight, Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), an entry man with a short fuse, Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), a hijacker, Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), McManus's partner, and Kint himself. Having being picked up one time too many, the group hatch a plot to pay the crooked cops back, and eventually start taking jobs from the shady Redfoot (Peter Greene).\n\nWhile the build-up to the explosion seen at the beginning of the film is relatively formulaic in its execution, Singer and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie (who won an Oscar for his efforts) inject enough humour into the script to bring these characters alive, and bring them over to your side. The clever thing is that it soon becomes apparent that everything were seeing either isn't true or isn't at all relevant, and it's the increasingly looming presence of the mysterious and infamous criminal mastermind Keyser Soze, who may in fact hold all the cards. The twist is not particularly clever at all, and isn't that hard to guess, but the director's skill in capturing it is what makes it so memorable.\n\nThe now-iconic poster wouldn't be so iconic if the characters hadn't been so memorably played by it's cast. With the exception of Kint, the characters are little but stock characters, but there is genuine chemistry, especially in the line-up scene where they crack up after Baldwin's over-the-top delivery of a line. Byrne proves again that he is much more deserving than the mediocre roles he tends to land, and Spacey bagged a Supporting Actor Oscar for his puppy-dog con-man. It's far, far from deserving of its place as #23 on IMDb's top films of all time, but The Usual Suspects is riveting stuff, even after it's umpteenth viewing.\n\nwww.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

But of course a movie doesn't just pop up to #20 for luck right? Although there are some movies that doesn't deserve to be on the top 250, like American gangster...\n\nAnyway more to the movie, the first 10 seconds of watching i was already excited, the music was perfect which kept me busy. And then when the movie was over i was like \"Wow...this is perfect\" And it is really. This is the ultimate thriller, i know understand why it's on #20. The characters were very well prepared so the actors had really easy to go into them. I thought the most well played actor was Benicio Del Toro, he played \"Fenster\" and he did it really good, so my hat goes off for him.\n\nAnyway the movie was as i said perfect, which it why i gave it a 10/10 which doesn't happen to often. The movie was so clever that in the end of the movie you'll go \"Oh..how come i didn't notice that?!\" I'm not going to reveal anything of the plot, that's up to you to see but i will give you this hint: \"Keep your eyes open\" The usual suspects 10/10 \"Brilliant,perfect,clever, this movie will never die\""

That includes a ending twist that negates the whole film.\n\nStill, there are many good things in this film, including fine performances from Stephen Baldwin (surprisingly so), Benicio Del-Torro, Gabriel Byrne, Chazz Palmienteri, and Kevin Spacey (his first Oscar he earned for).

Yeah, this is a good movie, but I don't see how it separates itself so distinctly from every other movie like it. Don't say there aren't movies like it because there are every year and there were every year before it for the previous 20 years. By the way, Kevin Pollack is a hack comedian who has relied on three impressions to make a career. It seems I'm of that generation that thinks every decent movie of the 1990's is an all time great, but I really think time will show that there are many, many better movies than this."

The writer, Christopher McQuarrie, justly won the Oscar and several other awards. The film and director Singer probably deserved more awards than they received, but it doesn't matter.

        "review_title": "A Convoluted Crime with a Great Escape",
        "review_detailed_main": "The Usual Suspects is a 1995 Crime-Thriller directed by Bryan Singer. The film stars Kevin Spacey, Benicio Del Toro, Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, and Kevin Pollak as the film's group of hardened criminals. The film follows Kevin Spacey's character, Roger \"Verbal\" Knit as he narrates a series of crimes to the Police to find the truth of a high scale massacre.\n\nThe acting in the film is hit or miss. For the most part, the main cast does a great job in the portrayal of their characters. Kevin Spacey's portrayal of Verbal is well done. Verbal has a physical disability and is considered to be stupid. Spacey displays a convincing lack of mobility in the film. Simultaneously, Spacey's body language is believably timid and mild manner. Moreover, Benicio Del Toro's portrayal of Fred Fenster was fantastic. Del Toro engrains Fenster with a thick accent that lends a realistic and natural spirit to the character. Gabriel Byrne plays Dean Keaton, serving as the assumed leader of the criminals. Byrne's portrayal of Keaton grants the film levity and a cooler head. Byrne's facial expressions are really well done. Keaton is a character tormented by his past. Despite being haunted, Keaton serves as the straight man, driven by love as opposed to gain. Chazz Palminteri acts as Officer, Dave Kujan. Palminteri does a great job showcasing intensity and grit when needed. He drives the film by answering the questions when needed. Despite moments of great acting, the dialogue suffers from poor writing and delivery in some aspects.\n\nSome characters are one-dimensional. Certain actors deliver their lines with too much force and intensity. Verbal has the best dialogue in the film. \"The greatest trick that the devil ever pulled was making people believe he didn't exist,\" is an incredible line. The police officers in the film are also afforded some great lines, and engaging moments of discourse. At times, anger throughout the film feels unnecessary. In terms of being written, specific characters are very dumb, whereas others are brilliant. The aggression in the film is heavy handed at moments, diluting the story's progression. Up until the conclusion, the story is convoluted and predictable. The time jumps and flashbacks are placed poorly at moments. The story could've benefited from more \"present day\" moments, rather than flashbacks. On the other hand, the ending makes up for a lot of these issues by being so impactful. The convolution of the story is a testament to who is truly narrating it.\n\nThe cinematography is decent for its time. Mostly, there's no unique style to be had in the cinematography. The camera work is atypical for an action film in the 90s. The best shot moments in the film come from the conclusion. The action in this film is decent. The audio mixing is bright toward the end of the film. However, the soundtrack is very bland, making the film feel like a direct to TV movie, as opposed to a theatrical release.\n\nOverall, The Usual Suspects is confusing at first, but recoups with an iconic and memorable ending. The Usual Suspects is a good crime-thriller driven by great acting."

People are afraid to say how lousy this is, because their friends will get on them. But I will say it. #1, Stephen Baldwin is in it...so how good can it be? #2 Kevin Spacey is a criminal. He lies to the police and makes up a story to cover his own butt. The cops have busted him, and instead of confessing, he makes up a lie about the Kaiser. This movie is considered original? A criminal lies to the police?? THAT is so original? It happens every single day, people!!! I can't believe so many people like this movie. It's about a crook who lies to the cops...like there's something original or shocking about that. Think about it. Do you really like this movie because of Stephen Baldwin and a man telling a lie, or do you like it because you know you're supposed to like it..."

        "review_title": "The best thriller of the '90s",
        "review_detailed_main": "The first and best reason to remember The Usual Suspects is one single line, spoken by low-level crook Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey): \"The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist\". The cult phrase refers to Keyser Soze, a legendary criminal mastermind who, while unseen (or not, depending on the point of view), dominates the events of Bryan Singer's small yet massive masterpiece, the most accomplished entry in the thriller genre made during the '90s.\n\nChristopher McQuarrie's complex, intelligent and Oscar-winning script (lots of flashbacks in this one) kicks off with the final stage of a massacre, culminating in the execution of a certain Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) and the explosion of the boat on which 27 people were brutally murdered. The sole survivor, the aforementioned Verbal, tells Detective Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) how it all started: six weeks earlier, someone stole a truck, and five \"usual suspects\" were lined up and arrested. These included Verbal and Keaton, plus the arrogant Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), the dim-witted McManus (Stephen Baldwin) and the latter's lover, the hard-to-understand Fenster (Benicio Del Toro, who apparently really had problems when it came to making his lines intelligible).\n\nNow, as Keaton pointed out then and Verbal points out now, the usual strategy is putting one real criminal alongside four random buffoons who practically participate in line-ups for a living. Why were those five sharing a cell, then? The answer pops up after their release: the five suspects are contacted by a sinister attorney who goes by the name Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) and told that they have to fulfil an assignment for Keyser Soze, otherwise they will all die. As the story proceeds, the incredulous police come to realize they're not dealing with the usual crime, or the usual perpetrators for that matter.\n\nThe film is clearly an independent production (all scenes were filmed in a limited number of locations, mostly indoors, and the director himself famously appeared in front of the camera in some of the close-ups), but it certainly thinks big, like most smaller films from the late '80s and early '90s. The title is of course an explicit homage to Casablanca, one of Singer's favorite movies, and the intricate plotting is blockbuster-worthy (if only most blockbusters were written this well). What it lacks in size it makes up for in mood and tension, both of which are provided largely through John Ottman's editing and music.\n\nThe other key attraction, sort of inevitably with such a cast, is the acting: Del Toro's performance promised a very bright future (and Traffic and 21 Grams have done nothing to prove him wrong), Byrne, Baldwin and Pollak delivered the last truly memorable silver-screen work of their careers (not that Baldwin had that much to speak of in the first place), and in the crippled, verbose Kint Spacey found the perfect role to impose himself as one of the fundamental screen presences of our time. And that's without mentioning the elusive figure of Keyser Soze: whether he's physically portrayed by someone or not, he is rightfully remembered as one of the most enduring cinema villains ever created. Not bad for a guy who hardly has any screen-time at all (or does he?).\n\nAlongside The Silence of the Lambs and Se7en, The Usual Suspects qualifies as the most intelligent and enjoyable thriller of the '90s. The extra points it scores are all due to the particular nature of its \"central\" villain: even more than Hannibal Lecter, Keyser Soze and his tricks won't leave your mind very easily."

        "review_detailed_main": "A lot can be said about the Usual Suspects that makes you wonder just what kind of film it is: epic twists, killer dialogue, excellent performances, hardcore action and much more. All of these beg the modern question... who did the director steal his best ideas from? Well that's just it. Although Suspects does owe a debt of gratitude to many films, Casablanca being one example, it was made a long time before the recent crop of films created by directors nicking their best ideas of other people.\n\nThis is no Tarantino-esquire film because it was made before he hit the full heights of his popularity. It has no Shyamalan style twist because old M. Night probably got the idea from Suspects. In short, this was the film that provided the catalyst for an awful lot of what we now regard as standard in our noirish, modern films.\n\nFor anyone who has yet to see this movie any talk of the plot would spoil the surprise, not just the one at the end but the genuine thrill of seeing every actor involved create an ensemble piece of such exquisite pace, tension and thrill. Whether it's Benicio Del Toro's bizarre Fenster, Kevin Pollack's bitter-sweet Hockney or even Stephen Baldwin's characteristic McManus, this film has a bunch of actors doing perhaps their best work to date, even beyond the five in the line up.\n\nThere are a few minor quibbles. Continuity provides a problem in places as does the explanations for some characters' motives. The film jumps around different time-lines fairly unpredictably and you can be forgiven for wondering whether the whole thing is just a big shaggy dog story. On the other hand, as twisty turny thrillers go this one can't be beat.\n\nIf you have yet to do so buy, not see or rent but buy, this film, watch it all the way through with no one (as they'll be hopping up and down on their seat desperately trying to explain the clever bits and pieces that Singer and co have strewn throughout) and enjoy one of the best examples of modern film making. You must be warned though, when I saw it for the first time I had to start it again right from the beginning just to get to grips with the ending!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Before I watched the movie, I've read many comments comparing \"The Usual Suspects\" with \"L.A. Confidential\", which concluded that this one is even better. So I held an eminent anticipation on it. But two hours later, I just could not understand why this nonsense got so much higher votes and evaluation than \"L.A. Confidential\".\n\nI'm saying this, not because of the labels people usually will put on this movie: confusing, twisted and so on. Actually, I don't think the plot is hard to comprehend. To be honest, I figured out who Kaiser is just at the very beginning. It was so obvious.\n\nThe reason is, many fabulous elements in \"L.A. Confidential\", or should I say, a successful movie, are missing. First of all, the most important thing: the vivid sculpture of the characters. From \"L.A. Confidential\", we remember the three young cops, the evil captain, the gorgeous hooker, the sly and sneaky little old news reporter\u0085 So many impressive roles there. But what is in \"The Usual Suspects\"? I feel sorry to say, nothing. Maybe Kevin Spacey's performance can be a little compensation, but not enough at all.\n\nSecond of all, the conflict. In \"L.A. Confidential\", conflicts are everywhere, between justice and crime, between righteousness and personal career, between love and cheat, between different parts or even in the deep soul of one part. While in \"The Usual Suspects\", without these conflicts, the movie is not dramatic and attractive but cadaverous and boring.\n\nThe third one, ambiance. In \"L.A. Confidential\", I can sense the emotion the director planed to deliver to us. Sometimes intensive, sometimes thrilling, sometimes dangerous, sometimes love-filling, sometimes nervous, sometimes horrifying\u0085.Well, when I watched this one, I almost fell asleep in the middle.\n\nI don't think we need a fourth reason to prove this crap. I hate these plays which consider themselves intelligent and tricky enough to make up some mendacious tales to bluff the audience, and turn out to be so stupid and fake. There is always a wire-puller in such movies, who seems to be omnipotent and can do whatever he wants, conniving some brilliant schemes. But finally these schemes are always deliberately mystifying and illogical. I prefer real and organized films like \"L.A. Confidential\". You know, we audience are also smart."

It opens up with the tail end of a massacre on boat just before being lit up to flames. We then end up in interrogation room with Verbal Kint (played by Kevin Spacey) telling the cops how he ended up on the boat. At this point the movie seems to pick up the events (mostly) in the order they happened until those crucial moments on the horrific ship. As Verbal goes into detail how him and four other ex-cons were wrongfully detained for questioning 6 weeks earlier and ended up working together 'taking jobs.' There's Keeton (Gabriel Byrne) who is looking for way out and go straight, Finster (Benicio Del Toro who really started his career here literally) whose horrible accent brings a lot of laughs but basically pals around his convict hot headed buddy McMannis(Stephen Baldwin). Then there's Hockney(Kevin Pollock)whose comedic input serves the tone well especially since he really plays the angry smart ass of the gang. I really don't want to type too much else cause either A most of you know the story even if you haven't seen it or B you've seen it. What I really wanted to say about this movie is that people who don't like it are people who never really got it or people who have not seen the whole thing from the beginning. Yes I said I love this movie and I'll always defend it. However, the movie holds up the best way in an initial viewing or maybe 4 or 5 times after that."

The characters are great and funny which does help tremendously.

I hate to say it but I'd have to join the small elite bunch who figured it out early on and didn't have much to watch afterwords. I've seen much better twists. This movie is a good first watch, after that it seems like every other action/thriller with a twist ending but not as thrilling or action packed or dramatic or envoking or ..."

The catch (plot twist, surprise ending) is so painfully obvious through the movie that you simply have endure ridiculous dialogue, mediocre cinematography and drillingly painful stereotypes to find out what you already knew. The only saving grace of this incredibly overrated film is the fine cast of actors, specifically Stephen Baldwin, Byrne and Del Toro. Spacey is so-so and Kevin Pollack is himself, but they are still far more enjoyable than anything else the film offers.\n\nOverrated and excessive. Certain to insult your intelligence. Grade: 65%"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Usual Suspects stands as an unparalleled masterpiece in the realm of crime thrillers. The movie will simply amaze you with its brilliantly woven narrative and an amazing cast that delivers exemplary performances.\n\nAt the heart of the movie lies its unforgettable cast of characters. The entire cast all add depth and diversity to the group of criminals. Each character is distinctive and brings a unique dynamic to the narrative, making the interactions between them as captivating as the plot itself. Every actor played their part perfectly and I wouldn't change anyone in any role I do believe. The movie owes much of its success to the incredible cast, whose talents mesh seamlessly to create a gripping and unforgettable cinematic experience. Although I say all this I do not believe it's the best acting from anyone individually. But that's because it's a true testament to the fact that case members can all come together to make the acting far better than it would be individually. By this I mean to say if you take a single actor and separate them the acting may not seem amazing. But the perfect cast was assembled that all together make the movie's characters brilliant. They all complement each other to magnificent effect.\n\nAnother brilliance of the movie is in its storytelling, which takes the audience on a thrilling ride through a labyrinth of deceit. The plot is constructed brilliantly with twists and turns that seamlessly fit together perfectly and don't seem pulled out of thin air adding nothing. All of this culminating in an astonishing revelation that leaves viewers in awe. The movie's ability to keep you speculating and engaged in discussions long after the credits roll is a testament to its intelligent and compelling narrative. Many a film have twists and turns that simply fall flat. So having twists/a twist doesn't necessarily mean a good movie. This is one such case of how it can work very well within a narrative. Utterly brilliant story. I feel the story will leave you both stunned and satisfied. Every piece of the puzzle falls perfectly into place, making it a cinematic experience unlike any other. Not a single moment in this movie bored me and made me want to skip ahead. This movie had me hooked from the first scene to the last. The movie encourages speculation and even if you managed to predict some aspects of the twists, the sheer brilliance of the storytelling and character development ensures that it remains an enthralling journey from start to finish.\n\nI am one such viewer that predicted the plot twist down to its most minuscule details. I predicted the final scene of the film as soon as it's possible to do so. Although this sounds like it's a negative, I had such fun throughout the movie and paused it several times to speak to myself for about 20 minutes on what I believe to be happening. The ending is one that I will always remember until I pass. It is truly one of the great movie endings.\n\nThe soundtrack of the movie must have been brilliant. However I would like to admit I cannot remember it even after only just finishing thee cinematic masterpiece. I was so infatuated with every other part of the story that I didn't even pay attention to the soundtrack. I must assume it's good however as if it wasn't I feel I would be noticeable. Apologies on this front but if I said anything other than this I would be making up stuff to say.\n\nThe runtime was a perfect length and the movie didn't ever feel like it was making itself longer simple to pad for length. Very well done to the director and their team for this.\n\nOverall the movie is a masterpiece that has stood the test of time. Its extraordinary cast, captivating characters, and masterfully crafted narrative make it a true masterpiece in the world of cinema. There is no room for criticism here as every aspect of the film is incredible. If you haven't experienced this cinematic triumph yet, it is a must-watch for any lover of thrillers and storytelling at its finest.\n\n10/10."

After finishing them, I surfed the web in order to find really good movies I haven't watched yet; more precisely on IMDb, when I checked the IMDb Top 250 list out . I knew most of the movies, at least I've watched the plot, nevertheless this didn't happen with Usual Suspects, I have never watched a trailer or read some synopsis\u0085Nothing. Therefore I rented the movie which from my point of view started kind of slowly. Afterwards, I honestly felt confused about the combination of scenes in different timeline; you need to pay close attention to the unexpected and subtle movements on the storyline. Suspense, tension and psychological terror might be the exact words to describe this masterpiece, tangled story with several important characters whom cannot be ignored, with the masterly performance of Kevin Spacey who totally deserved the Oscar for best actor. You must stay hooked up to the screen because this film has in my opinion the best movie ending of all time. Only thing that sucks about this movie is that you can only watch it for the first time once."

        "review_detailed_main": "Truly one of the funniest non-comedy movies I've seen. Jokes aren't forced either, they come from the characters' personalities rather than injected for cheap laughs. The script is amazing, one of my favourites ever. So quotable. it weaves together so well and there's so much call back, moving in an almost cyclical structure. The dialogue feels authentic and witty, especially how people like that usually would talk. Kevin Spacey has got all the talent in the world, genuinely one of the greatest actors of his generation, possibly of all time. This movie shows that as not once does he break character for not even a shred. He shows every emotion through the course of the movie and portrays that slight angst that something isn't quite right, which ultimately there is. The other actors are top notch as well. Namely Chazz Palminteri (Dave Kajun) as he portrays the thoughts and methodical actions of his work. I would say Benicio Del Toro smashes it, which he does, but it is a pain to try and understand what he is saying, and ultimately reading subtitles can suck you out if a movie (At least for me anyway). The uncertainty throughout makes us question everything in the movie. This perfectly sets up the final act, in which there is one of the best plot twists for any movie. The theme of trust is prevalent through the movie, no one truly trusts anyone, much less us for any characters emphasised by the untrustworthy narrator through the movie."

It isn't the best thing in the universe, but if you don't know how it ends, it's fun. When I was younger this was my favorite movie of all time. It has aged pretty well, and the acting is outstanding from everyone involved in the project. The surprises are throughout the movie, making it fun to watch. Del Toro's performance especially, the scene where he pisses on the fire, and the ending make this a must-see."

My father put it absolutely brilliantly when he said 'When I got to the end, I rewound it back to the beginning and started again. With no other film have I ever done that.' The first time you see this film, you are slightly confused perhaps even frustrated but it just gets better and better every time I stick it into my DVD player."

The plot is not too complicated, if confusing at first.\n\nHowever, the lines the characters feed us are a little too slick, and some of the acting is a bit over done, especially on the part of Chazz Palminteri and Stephen Baldwin. Benicio Del Toro is unfortunately not at his best, while Kevin Spacey presents the top performance of the lot, and the rest of the cast gives only an acceptable one, but not much better.\n\nIf you like criminal intrigue, you probably will like it."

        "review_detailed_main": "No matter how many times I watch The Usual Suspects, and believe me it's been many, I still get the same diabolical thrill, the same rapturous excitement and the same rush of storytelling and dramatic payoff as I did the very first time I saw it. Every performance from the vast and diverse cast is a devilish creation packed with red herrings, juicy dialogue and bushels of menace, every scene piles on the mysticism of the criminal underworld beat by beat, until the characters begin to pick it apart and the whole thing unravels like a great serpent coiling forth bit by bit, scale by scale, swerving toward the shocking, disarming third act that has since become as legendary as it's elusive and terrifying antagonist. In the crime/mystery corner of cinema, there's no arguing that this delicious piece of hard boiled intrigue reigns supreme, and it's easy to see why. In a seemingly random police lineup, five career criminals are harassed by an unseen hand, pushed into carrying out dangerous heists and violent manoeuvres by a shadowy campfire tale among the world of organized crime, a Boogeyman called Keyser Soze, if he even exists at all. Slick and sleazy ex cop Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) heads up this dysfunctional crew of vagabonds which includes hothead McManus (Stephen Baldwin in a role originally intended for Michael Biehn, which kills me to this day), weirdo Fenster (Benicio Del Toro, using an indecipherable mishmash of an accent that would be the first of many), spitfire Hockney (Kevin Pollak) and Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) the runt of the litter. The lot of them are intimidated into performing risky enterprises by lawyer Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) until the climate of their actions reaches a boiling point and answers emerge from the darkness. This is all told in retrospect by Spacey, to a rabid customs agent (Chazz Palminteri) who has designs on ensnaring Soze. Spacey scored Oscar gold for his heavy work here, spinning a tale whose layers interweave and pull the wool over our eyes time and time again before offering any glimpses of truth. Byrne is a fiercely guarded storm as Keaton, a man with secrets so deep even he doesn't know who he is anymore, letting the anger set and smoulder in those glacial eyes of his. The supporting cast adds to the class and confusion terrifically, with fine work pouring in from Dan Hedeya, Suzy Amis, Giancarlo Esposito and a wicked cameo from Peter Greene, who provides a moment of inspired improv. The score of the film rarely relies on dips and swells until all is said and done, keeping a tight lid on the orchestra and feeding us nervous little riffs of anxious portent that keeps tension on a tightrope and anticipation on call. A mystery this tantalizing is irresistible the first time around, but the trick is to make your story re-watchable, and I've seen this thing over a dozen times. Every viewing provides some new angle to the story I didn't see before, or I notice a subtle interaction in the very naturalistic and funny dialogue which escaped me in the past. My favourite thing to do is watch films with someone who hasn't seen them before, observe their reactions and opinions on every little story beat and cinematic flourish, it's almost more fun for me than the actual film itself. The Usual Suspects is a showcase piece for that activity, because you get to see this very complex revelation unfold through new eyes as you watch them experience the revelations. Whether your first viewing or your fiftieth, it never loses its power, and the spell it casts just doesn't dim. Masterpiece"

        "review_detailed_main": "Movies like this will make you yearn for the golden age of cinema that was the '90s, where seemingly Hollywood was just releasing instant classic after instant classic.\n\nThis was sadly one of those movies that I overlooked when I was younger. In my haze of binging Netflix DVD rentals as a teen, I remember watching the first 20 minutes of this and turning it off, not knowing that I was missing out on probably one of the most intelligently-written films ever produced.\n\nGranted, it's nonlinear structure might be somewhat confusing, but the movie isn't as complicated as some people say it is. The movie essentially unwraps in a series of interesting scenes related to a heist. As Spacey's character Verbal narrates all these recollections in his life to Agent Kujan (Chazz Palminteri), we learn more and more about the mysterious figure behind the madness, Keyser S\u00f6ze. The only question we all have is: who is Keyser S\u00f6ze?\n\nThe funny thing is, I already knew who S\u00f6ze was when I sat down with the intention to watch this film to its full conclusion, but that didn't detract me from appreciating the ending whatsoever. Nor did it stop me from appreciating the sharp screenwriting, excellent direction, and mesmerizing performance by Spacey, who rivals his role in Seven, which I previously thought was the top acting in his career.\n\nThis is one of those classics you want to rewatch as soon as it's finished, just because you're so blown away by the time it's all finished that you want to re-examine the pieces and figure out how the filmmakers were able to pull one over you so cleverly. Highly recommended."

I'm also tired of these Who-done-it movies relying mostly on narration to tell the story...Its like there saying..\"gee our story doesn't make sense so lets just have kevin spacey tell the story\". Movie makers like the narration approach because they can just make up whatever,whenever. Don't get me wrong, the film was entertaining but i freaked when i saw it rated 18th outta 250. Its hard to believe that this movie rated higher them Memento."

There is absolutely no logic in the story, the characters are boring and everything is mixed together and that makes the movie very confusing and extremely boring.\n\nFive stupid men are the main characters, and all they do is talk about stupid things in a boring way. Occasionally the director puts in a little stupid action which makes no particular sense.\n\nOverall: A very clumsy attempt to make a crime movie. And I'm sorry that it isn't possible to vote less than 1 for this movie failure. It's a disgrace to the whole movie industry.\n\nIf you want to see a brilliant crime movie you should try \"Seven\" or \"The Silence Of The Lambs\". True classics!"

The writing was just phenomenal by Christopher McQuarrie and the ending had me blown away, this movie has been honored as my favorite movie and one of the greatest thrillers of all time.\n\nWhen I had first seen this movie it had high expectations, it went above those expectations.

The Usual Suspects gets a 10/10 because it has and will always be a great movie."

Also, Benecio Del Toro The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.\" Five criminals are pulled in for a bogus police line-up, only for them to be set up to do a job by the feared & infamous keyser soze; they're hatching their own plan.

Kevin Spacey turns in a great performance as Verbal, setting an oddball tone. The rest of the crew is headed by Gabriel Byrne's Dean Keaton, with thugs Kevin Pollack, Benicio Del Toro and Stephen Baldwin along for the ride. This crew of five shows great clashing chemistry. In the end, you'll be shocked. \"The Usual Suspects\" has become a new crime cult classic."
