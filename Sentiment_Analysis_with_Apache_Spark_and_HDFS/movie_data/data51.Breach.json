The plot makes no sense, the characters make no sense, the acting is insanely bad.

It 's a 3-star movie just because the story is not that bad and literally 3 scenes of the movie are good. But i can't recommend this to anyone with a taste in sci-fi. Watch Pandorum instead or re-watch another sci-fi and avoid the disappointment. 3/10"

Bruce should buy up all copies, burn them; put a full page ad in the Times apologizing to his fans, friends, fellow actors, family and unborn grandchildren as well as give us all refunds!

The huge space ship puts everyone to sleep until they reach their new destination in about 6 months or so except a team of workers stay awake to make sure everything stays safe during the long journey & here we have our rugged team with the old A-hole veteran Bruce Willis as Clay & his new team mate played by Cody Kearsley (Riverdale) a maintenance/Cleaner & Johnny Messner (Sabotage) & a few other recognisable faces amongst the skeleton Crew & the leader/Captain of the ship the great B-movie legend THOMAS JANE (Deep Blue Sea, The Mist, The Predator, Nemesis, The Punisher) I'm a big Jane fan & even though he has basically a glorified Cameo it's better for the film that he's in it!!! Bruce Willis starts out as a big A-hole with a drinking problem & a bad attitude but as the film goes along he's the Willis we know & love. This Crew are up against an Alien creature that gets aboard the ship & starts to infect the workers & does all kinds of bloody & gross stuff & gradually are small crew have to gear up & fight this thing in an \"ALIEN\" kind of way & it's pretty fun B-movie stuff.\n\nThe effects are very poor & thats due to the tiny budget but the actual creature looks good & the possessed workers are pretty Cool in a \"Prince of Darkness\" kind of way & the film has that fun late-night feel to it which i love. Yes cheap & tacky effects & a Willis that really is only there for the paycheck but it's a fun little survival Apocalyptic sci-fi Thriller with a nice little bit for Thomas Jane. I liked it, good B-movie fun."

He actually has a decent amount of screen time and brings it with this film ' its a lot better than the majority of other VOD titles he has done as of late. This film is clearly competent and a fun no thought process needed type of film' reminiscent of the 90 style films made for a lot more than I'm sure this budget had even back then. I think it deserves at least a 6 so I bump it up to 8 based on all the hate. Lots of negative people reviewing too, have a look at most of their other reviews of other films, totally negative stuff.

I have to admit, going into it with all the low ratings - and Bruce Willis is in it, I was expecting another flop. Now I'm not saying this wasn't a flop, but it was an awesome flop. And Willis was actually somewhat convincing in this role.\n\nJohn Suits' directing was his usual amateur-hour. But producer, actor and co-writer Corey Large alongside co-writer and actor Edward Drake, managed to throw a whole bunch of popular sci-fi genre films in a blender, and come out with something so ridiculous, it was entertaining and hilarious at the same time. It had: Alien, Zombieland, Ghostbusters, Skyline, The Blob and many more, and although cheesy at first, the humor an audacity to do this worked for me. What's funnier, is that when I told friends about it, they were curious, and I actually didn't mind seeing it again - especially when we hit the bongs, and it was so funny and awesome, we were in stitches laughing! Try it, trust me, this is how this film was meant to be viewed.\n\nThe dated S/VFX, cheesy 80's sets, the excellent choice of colors and excellent cinematography, as well as actually having a decent score - rare for cheap B-grade films, just added to how much better this film was than any of us initially thought. The casting was ok, and although the performances lacked quality, I blame Suits for not directing his cast properly. The 92 min runtime was ok, but the pacing needed to be faster and/or the runtime cut shorter. Nevertheless, and I can't believe I'm actually saying this... but it's a recommend see, and a well deserving 6/10 from me!"

I'm sure this was shot on a very limited budget but its difficult to suspend disbelief when you are watching a spaceship with concrete walls and chipboard hyper sleep chambers.\n\nBruce Willis is actually in this one quite a bit, rather then the one scene films he usually appears in these days, but he doesn't really have much to do and most scenes are just him sipping from a hip flask and watching someone else work. I suppose you could watch this as a drinking game film and take a drink every time Bruce does, maybe thats what the writers were going for.\n\nThe plot doesn't seem to make much sense, why would you need five janitors to clean the bathrooms of 15 other people. How much mess can they make - clearly a lot as the protagonist has to spend a year cleaning toilets. Odd.\n\nI thought the directors last film, 3022, was pretty good and was surprised its the same director of photography on this film as it just looks so bad and the shots are terrible.\n\nI can only guess perhaps the budget wasn't there for this film or it was shot in a hurry for whatever reason. Either way its not much fun to watch unless you enjoy looking at how to cheaply make an unconvincing spaceship set."

        "review_detailed_main": "I wanted to post a quick review of this movie because I really don't think it deserves all the negative reviews it's getting here. \"Breach\", to me, very much felt like a low-budget science fiction horror movie along the lines of the ones they used to make in the 80s and 90s. It's dark and gritty and, what I found to be refreshing this day and age, not politically correct at all.\n\nOne reviewer complained the sets look bad, but I thought they appeared exactly like I expect (and want) the inside of a space ship to look like in a bleak, futuristic world where Earth has gone to hell and mankind is struggling to survive. Both it and its crew reminded me of \"Event Horizon\" since the atmosphere and look of \"Breach\" are very similar to that and also reminiscent of \"Alien 3\". Maybe those two won't go down in history as the best science fiction movies ever made, but I, for one, still enjoyed them and I would much rather watch something like \"Breach\" than all of those clean and realistic ones that are being produced nowadays, like \"the Martian\" or \"Gravity.\" Back in the 80s and 90s they made many dark, low budget sci fi movies, which were not very realistic at all, but that wasn't the point. They all took place in a bleak, hopeless future where humanity had destroyed all the beauty in the world and life was basically a daily struggle for survival in whatever setting the movie took place. But after \"The Matrix\" came out, science fiction changed (although, ironically, those films take place in a similar setting) and the only movies I can think of which were made in that style in the 2000s are \"Doomsday\" and \"The Gene Generation\", although they used a bit too much CGI for my taste. 2018's \"Death Race 4: Beyond Anarchy\" was better in that way and it was very refreshing to me to having been able to watch another film that tries to keep that particular niche alive. As for Bruce Willis, I thought he was very good in \"Breach\" and delivered pretty much what you'd expect from him in this role: the witty, tough as nails anti-hero that he's become famous for.\n\nSo give this movie a chance. Of course it's not as good as \"Alien\" or even \"Event Horizon\", but watching it, it brought back memories from when I was a teenager, checking out the science fiction and horror sections of my local video store, looking for exactly this kind of film. I'm happy it got made if only for allowing me to experience that sensation again years later when there aren't even any more of those magical places left in the world."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Breach\" is a film with a current rating of 3.1 on IMDB...low enough to merit its inclusion on its infamous Bottom 100 List. This would mean it's bad enough to be among the worst big budget films ever made...and as I watched the film it just didn't seem THAT bad...or even close. Sure, \"Breach\" is a bloody, violent and incredibly depressing film....and I am NOT singing its praises...but it is NOT 3.1 bad. It makes me wonder if there's something going on here...some attack on the film for some reason I do not understand. Again...I am not saying it's good....but it just didn't seem Bottom 100 worthy.\n\nThis very depressing story is set over 120 years from now. The population of the Earth is 19,000,000,000 and some sort of plague is destroying mankind. So, in desperation, some huge ships are sent into space in order to send a small number of humans to what's been called 'New Earth'.\n\nThe odd hero of this story is a stowaway. Most of the folk aboard the ship are in cryogenic suspension....with only a tiny complement to run the ship. During this time, some creature attacks and it's not only murderous but very smart. After invading a host's body, it begins working towards killing....and there's simply no reasoning with it....it only wants death. What's next? Well, I'm not going to spoil it in case you actually do want to see it.\n\nCould part of the reason the film did so badly is because during COVID folks did NOT want to see a film about the destruction of the human race? Perhaps. The timing certainly COULD have been better!! Maybe, maybe not...but it certainly is NOT a feel-good film!! But despite its gloom and violence and bloodshed, it's NOT a particularly badly made film. Depressing, you betcha. Bad, not especially and I have seen hundreds, if not thousands of worse films....worse films which, somehow, have much higher ratings and less hate than this film."

Ok, no problem. -But, we need you to finish the script today, because tomorrow we start shooting. -Oh, wow, wait... Don't you think...? -I know what you are thinking, but don't worry... We will do as we usually do: false advertisement, we say is the best movie ever, bla, bla, bla... And we just put a movie star there... I think Bruce Willis is available. -Ok... so, let's do it!"

I don't expect much from Bruce Willis anymore and he lived down to my expectations. They have a star aboard but can't afford stars out the portholes. For some reason, they CGI'd a lighter flame...badly...for lighting a cigarette. Set looks and sounds a lot like Red Dwarf left over. There is obviously only one corridor. The reactor core is a bundle of red toy lightsabers. The plot and dialogue might have been written by remedial high schoolers. I can't comment on the acting as there wasn't any.\n\nTo be fair, I have seen worse so I gave it 2 stars to reserve space for those."

They come across some parasite creature that infects a person. And spreads towards others.\n\nThe plot is decent. Concept of a space crew coming across something on the ship. That turns a person into a mindless mutant. And a monstrous creature in the end that is trying to consume life. There are other better films like this such as Pandorum. Alien.\n\nThe direction in this film is terrible. Characters do make dumb decisions. The writing is cheesy and dumb. The acting is stale. It does have a great cast ensemble of actors that were in old action movies. Like Bruce Willis. Johnny Messner. And Thomas Jane whos performance who wears aviators shades inside a spaceship. Cody Kearsley performance is stale. Everyone is wasted in a bad script. The film also lacks thrills and suspense. The action is forgettable. The cliffhanger ending is entertaining."

When he doesn't, it's because he has crap to work with. Most \"science fiction\" movies are utter garbage, or at least just barely watchable if you know how to drink your way through them. Or write a little poetry, or talk to your mom during the romantic parts. This doesn't pretend to be something it's not, and thus, doesn't take itself too seriously. When I saw the ratings and looked at the trailer, I thought \"Wait, something is a bit off here!\" I rarely review anymore because over the years there are more and more whiners and princesses, and self-entitled primadonnas who are 100% negative, and that is NOT a \"review\" of a film! Complaining and belittling of any creative effort, no matter HOW seemingly bad something might be doesn't create a whole picture of an experience using the objective mindset needed to accurately explain an 'opinion' that is worthy of being taken seriously. Meaning, that too often it's ALL about the reviewer's emotions and expectations and creative 'fragility', and NOT about the movie itself. This was fun and perfectly campy, well written well acted. Everything was pretty believable and didn't insult your intelligence by pretending it was anything other than it was. It was simple and genuine and the writer knew his characters fairly well. And he wrote accordingly. The strongest arm of the movie is that it had genuine suspense! I was certainly not expecting that. Sadly, there are more and more princesses in the world writing reviews and less and less castles for them to feel safe in so they won't be SO disappointed and bereaved when a movies falls short of their narcissistic demand that it should have been better. I give it a six. The extra star is for the fact that it didn't insult expectations I never had in the first place."

Not sure if they blew whatever budget they had on getting permission to use the Halo warthog gun turret sound effect but the other comical part is these \"futuristic\" guns utilize 50-round drum magazines, yet zero shell casings come out and the AR-15 bolt dust covers remain closed when they're fired.\n\nI've seen B-movies where one A-list star carried the movie in order to improve viewership as well as acquaint the audience with a no-name supporting cast.

        "review_detailed_main": "Anti-Life (aka Breach): Not as bad as some say but still a bit of a mess. Bruce Willis is getting as bad as Nick Cage in accepting every role he's offered and here he plays a grizzled old veteran Space Navy Captain busted to the ranks for disobeying orders. He's on a Space Ark (doing menial work), fleeing earth as the environment finally collapses. 300,000 colonists (most in cryogenic sleep) are onboard, voyaging to New Earth which circles a distant star. But there's an alien parasite aboard! It kills crew members and then reanimates their bodies. They act and look like fast moving zombies so this is basically a zombies in space movie. The plot is a bit confused with a few hole and non-sequiturs. The acting and set design won't win any award either but it has a certain charm which kept me engaged, maybe it was the zombie element. Or the homages to Aliens, The Thing and other SF/Horror films. It had the ingredients to be a much better film but is just about watchable on a rainy evening. Directed by John Suits from a screenplay by Edward Drake and Corey Large. On Netflix. 5/10."

        "review_title": "A c-level sci-fi/horror cut and paste job, only distinguished by the fact that Bruce Willis is in more of it than you'd expect.",
        "review_detailed_main": "In the 23rd century, Humanity and Earth are on the cusp of an extinction level event and have begun evacuations for the colony of New Earth. Noah (Cody Kearsley) stows away on the U. S. S. Hercules impersonating a junior janitor while his pregnant girlfriend Hayley (Kassandra Clementi) is granted passage due to her father being the Admiral (Thomas Jane). While the passengers are put into hyper sleep Noah goes about custodial duties on the ship under the supervision of a demoted captain turned custodian, Clay (Bruce Willis), until eventually members of the support staff turn up dead or missing with signs pointing towards something inhuman as the culprit.\n\nTo look at Bruce Willis' career is depressing because not too long ago the man appear in major blockbusters such as G. I. Joe Retaliation, RED 2 and A Good Day to Die Hard, while these movies weren't critically well received (for good reason) they were at least projects that made sense given Willis' status as an international action star. But outside of exceptions like Glass and a cameo in Motherless Brooklyn, Willis' primary output has been direct-to-video/streaming fodder for the company Emmett/Furla/Oasis with these film's featuring Willis prominently as the second billed actor despite only being in it for maybe 10 minutes with the rest done off camera or with a body double. With only two days of shooting and guaranteed $1 million pay day for each film it's no mystery why Willis has gone down this route. Breach (aka Anti-Life) isn't an EFO production, but it does reunite Willis with some crew who have worked on his EFO films, and while Willis is more prominent here than he was in many EFO film's the quality is definitely not improved simply because there's more of Willis.\n\nThe movie is supposedly set in the 23rd century, but begins with a bunch of stock footage framed with a fish eye lens before transitioning to our \"future\" which looks like a rented storage area with a few dozen extras and a shambly chain link fence. And of course once we're actually on the ship things don't improve because it's clear it's just a refurbished warehouse with some red and green lights shined on walls with maybe the occasional flatscreen TV or poorly inserted hologram effect to assure the audience \"no seriously, this is the future!\". The movie features some brief CGI shots of the ship, but they're not particularly well rendered and it just calls attention to the fact that sets the crew are using are much smaller than it is. Not only is it unconvincing but despite being set in the 23rd century, the bathrooms on the ship look like public restrooms one would find at a bus stop and they're still using regular guns (which are cheap plastic replicas) except for one point where they break out cheap plastic lasers.\n\nThe movie doesn't even have a good story behind its lackluster production values, because it's basically a cut and paste job of most of the Alien knockoffs of the 80s, but without any tradecraft or endearing qualities that made films like Galaxy of Terror or Creature enjoyable. Surprisingly though, the film despite being marketed as such isn't as directly ripping off Alien as one might think (at first anyway). The movie throws in zombie tropes, bits from The Thing, and even a little bit of Space Mutiny (though at least Space Mutiny stole special effects from John Dykstra). Most of the plot beats of this story you'll be able to predict as they're pretty much all here just because they were in other movies. Willis looks visibly uninterested despite being a prominent actor in the film with more screentime here than he had in most of his EFO projects, and Cody Kearsley of TV's Riverdale is not an engaging presence and feels hopelessly lost and confused with no real idea how to approach this character.\n\nOn occasion I got a chuckle from some of the line deliveries (sometimes intentionally sometimes not) and there was a creature effect in the last ten minutes of the movie that looked okay(not great, but good enough) but then they overextended themselves with some rather inept expansions on it to try and milk all they could from it.\n\nBreach is a sad movie. It plays like one of those 90s direct to video films that tried to ape Alien's aesthetic on a miniscule budget, but at least those were made with no name actors on shoestring budgets and were kind of endearing in how stupid they were such as Leprechaun 4: In Space. Breach is just bare basics recycled to diminishing returns with the barest minimum of effort put in and sold to you using cast members like Bruce Willis to bank on their name recognition."

Really beautiful photography and the sound is up to par as well, and I am one who is usually really critical of these kind of technical details.\n\nMore good: the supporting actors are quite decent. One of them being even really good. The bad guy of this movie is really a tough dude. Acts quite good. I have seen him in other B-movies and he simply should be starring in popular A-movies, because he honestly has got the charisma.\n\nConcluding: expect a B-movie and you could have a nice watch, full of suspense, action and cool, tough guys."

Why was that? Well, I mean a movie that had both Bruce Willis and Thomas Jane on the cast list? What could possibly go wrong here? What would there be not to like?\n\nApparently if you take the movies \"Alien\" and \"28 Days Later\" and mix them together, you'd have the formula for \"Breach\" (aka \"Anti-Life\"), except that \"Breach\" lacked the intensity and entertainment that both those movie have. \"Breach\" just feels like a watered down hybrid version of those two movies, where all energy has been sucked away.\n\nThe storyline in \"Breach\" was as unoriginal as anything could be. Again, I redirect your attention to the \"Alien\" and \"28 Days Later\" movies and you have the storyline that writers Edward Drake and Corey Large managed to come up with. I am especially impressed that something like this would pass today and make it to the screen.\n\nThomas Jane was not really all that much in the movie, which was good, as this movie will not tarnish his movie record all that much. Bruce Willis, however, was there almost all the time, and this movie was a swing and a miss from him, and it doesn't make a great addition to his repertoire of movies.\n\nI managed to sit through the movie to the very end, though I was hardly entertained by \"Breach\". In fact, I was more dumbfounded that a movie so blatantly ripping off two established movies could see the light of day. And the ending of the movie, now that was just a slap to the face. The storyline have you beaten down and stepped upon, but the ending just brings a cold, dead fish to the game and slaps your face repeatedly. That ending was just abysmal. Not only was it generic and predictable, but it was just saying that the audience watching it deserved no better.\n\nYou might want to do yourself a favor and give \"Breach\" a wide berth. It is not worth the time, money or effort, believe you me. My rating of this 2020 movie lands on a generous three out of ten stars."

An alien lifeform has somehow made it's way onto the ship and inhabits increasingly more dead crew mates.\n\nThe movie is predictable at every turn, the writing is poor and full of plot holes. The writers are completely incompetent. I actually feel hard-pressed to call them writers, as what they've produced is barely even a movie. It just felt like a bit of a bad joke throughout.\n\nI can't believe I wasted my time watching this, so I've just created an account in order to leave this review."

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay, I'm being VERY generous, giving this a 4/10, but I will admit I sort of enjoyed this in a 'so bad it's fun' way. After watching the truly execrable 'Cosmic Sin' by the same director, my other half and I decided to we had to watch 'Anti-Life' (or 'Breach) just to see if it was equally terrible. And you know what? Shockingly, it wasn't!\n\nThat's not to say 'Anti-life' is good, by any means. It's actually pretty dreadful, but in comparison to 'Cosmic Sin', it at least had a vaguely coherent storyline, and progressed at a reasonable pace. Given that Bruce Willis and Rachel Nichols were in this for most of its run time (rather than the usual 'I could've shot my scenes in a day'), and that they're both good actors, I don't know why they didn't simply re-write the script to make them the leads. They would have been far better than the rather ineffectual unknown who plays the actual lead, and his even worse-acting romantic interest.\n\nEssentially the whole thing is an ultra-low-budget 'Alien' clone, with a dash of 'The Thing', already done numerous times in the 80s and 90s. It's so low budget, I would be amazed if it cost more than... I don't know... $100k? And 90% of that would've been on Bruce, Thomas Jane and Rachel Nichols.\n\nIt's such a low budget production, that they've used every old trick in the book. Packing crates for shining light through, various randomly shaped packaging items on the walls, spray painted to match the colour of the set, etc... As such, it's actually a fun example of how young up-and-coming film students can create sci-fi sets with zero budget!!\n\nEven at 'Anti Life's worst, you can play 'spot the polystyrene packaging on the wall', which keeps things fun. Oh, and don't forget the painted NERF guns with badly composited muzzle flashes!\n\nIt's all pretty bad, but it IS entertaining in a silly, cheesy, low budget way, most reminiscent of 90s made-for-tv movies, when poor CGI was just becoming available for low-budget efforts to throw at the screen.\n\nWhat can I say? I've seen a LOT worse, and it was more entertaining than The Last Jedi (My favourite stunningly-low-bar comparison movie, for all bad movies to be compared against). I didn't fall asleep before the end, which is something I can't even say of some Marvel movies. ;-)"

Its not a hidden fact that he will only work for an enormous price tag and these are the producers (who aren't very good at writing films) willing to fit that bill and everything else is chicken feed left for the rest of creatives. Blame everyone for continuing to watch them because they see Bruce. Maybe pay attention to smaller productions that can evenly spread the effort to make a decent film. As a B-movie this is much better than the majority of others I've seen though. As I actually like B-movies and watch them, with the majority have terrible dialogue, and sound editing. This actually excels at sound that since a lot of action is happening off screen and the VFX are not doing it any justice but sadly they are very bad unfortunately which is breaking the entire filmmaking illusion. Its brainless fun even though overall the script was bad. Rating this a 8 because a lot have unfairly judge it, because they may see Bruce and expect the moon. Those days are over."

They just follow orders to be on a specific place doing specific things, but they lack emotions. No one can blame them, anyway. I missed several parts for obvious reasons but , given that when I saw the admiral's cowboy attitude and fake voice I knew it was going to be a awful movie... There's no problem with that. I just let it play so it won't keep on my Prime's homepage.\n\nThere's a chance you like Z-class awfully bad zombie movies, it's the only reason to start watching it if you read any review. I knew a guy who likes them. Even I played as an extra for one of his BS zombie movies, haha!"

As long as they are kind of similar.\n\nLike I said before. In this review, I don't care about the quality of this or any other movie. This is for that Troll or anyone that does the same thing. Comparing a movie to 4 others and claiming it is a rip off of all 4. Stop wasting people's time implying that every movie ever made is just a rip off because it resembles 4 other movies. Lmfao."

Bruce Willis is one of Hollywood's finest actors, he never chooses too overly complicated roles and always a quirky sense of \"why am i in this situation\" nevertheless he's a brilliant actor who always delivers his lines with impeccable timing and looks like a guy I'd be drinking friends with. The same goes for Rachel Nichols, she's a lovely wonderful brilliant actress who was under used in this role (I might add) the same goes for Callan Mulvey and Timothy Murphy, again underused as they are both good method actors..\n\nBut for me, what broke the 4th wall wasn't the effects or the god awful lighting or their use of grey corridors, but the use of the Red Dwarf bedrooms, in fact I'm pretty sure all the corridor scenes were stolen from the Red Dwarf set too.\n\nThe alien, doing then black goop eye thing was straight out of the X files as was the whole alien premise, but nevertheless a damn fine Sunday afternoon movie with a decent level of suspense. Breaking the suspension of disbelief, the autopsy scene is simply laughable, so why don't they get real specialists in to block out these scenes... finally, does no one know what a headshot is ????\n\nIn fact now I've gone back and looked at it, watch any Red Dwarf episode and you'll see what I mean about the sets..\n\nNevertheless, I'd still go drinking with Bruce or Rachel"

Sadly, it is bad on almost every level, set, script, ending, tech, CGI, (think; Star Wars - 35 years ago and compare).\n\nSo, well done Bruce for effort and a huge thank you to all fellow cast members for staying with, and supporting the, leading role, Bruce's behaviour may well have been a difficult challenge to work with."

I recognized them immediately, because I have one myself. It made me laugh out loud and I couldn't take the movie seriously after that. I kept thinking about it. What sci-fi filmmaker uses something like that without adapting it so that viewers will not immediately recognize it?\n\nAfter watching for about 20 minutes, I decided I did not want to waste my time any further on this, so I stopped. I actually came to IMDb to read the reviews and see if I missed something, but apparently not."

The script was worse than most fan fiction. The acting just grim, I can imagine that every shot was 'got it on the first take'.\n\nI gave it ten minutes on its own merits, and watched the rest to see just HOW awful it is. This is one of very, very few movies that truly deserves a 1.

        "review_detailed_main": "99% of all films about space and technology are pessimistic. \"The Breach\" seems to me refreshingly optimistic about technology if probably somewhat ambiguous when it comes to space and the future. Compared to the \"Alien\" franchise though which is unambiguously dystopian and where you find a lot of toxic masculinity, the masculinity at play here and its goal, most people will propably end up sympathising with. To me it smells a bit like the people behind this film had different opinions of what the message should be. Nevertheless this low-budget film is in my view by far the best about these topics, second only to \"Interstellar\" which is also much more serious in tone.\n\nAdmittedly, Bruce in his later years needs a good director to direct him, but as in \"Death Wish\" here it succeeds and Bruce's performance as a result is more than decent. Furthermore most of the other actors are top-notch and what we have is a very entertaining film. Especially the first hour and the ending I find hilarious. At first it may seem like just pure entertainment but I must say it has grown on me since I first saw it some months ago. It's not that it's especially deep but nor is it the opposite. When I first saw it I would have given it 5 or 6 out of 10 but maybe because generally I don't care so much about how expensive films look, I think there's more to it than maybe first meets the eye. The fact that I find the actors and the dialogue so good and funny is for me the most essential.\n\nI could imagine that some of the reviewers who give this a negative rating find the masculinity here a tad too toxic. For me they found just the right balance.\n\nIn fact \"The Breach\" should in no way be seen as controversial and is a prime example of how a film can have a lot of humor without seeking the limits of free expression. Certainly compared to the 80's it's very harmless."

Some of those become rally good, others really bad. This is somewhere in the middle. When you see \"Willis\", Racheal Nichols, and Thomas Jayne in a SciFi, you'd expect you'd get quality, especially if you add in supporting actors from the Marvel-Verse. sadly the technical side of the film is let down by some poor choices, both in the \"Lets do a whole film hand-held\" decision, and then the dynamic range of the final audio mix, leaving viewers needing to reach for the volume control to hear the dialog in quiet scenes, then feel ears battered in the action sequences. The lighting and props would be fine, if this had been released in the 80's or 90's, and if it had been shot on film or one of the film-like digital cameras, instead of the Red listed in the technical details. The dialog isn't poor, it's bland, and it shows in the performances. About the only two places where the production seems to hold a consistent technical standard, is the Smoke Machine Operator, and the Colourist. You don't have to avoid this one, but you're not missing out on anything if you skip it."

Some actors clearly took their roles too seriously, but several appeared to be having fun chewing the scenery. The story is pretty certain it makes sense, and only a couple times tries to be more than what it is.\n\nIf you're wanting some genuine scifi action-adventure, skip the hell out of this one.

At least he isn't in this for a few seconds, but is actually playing a character.\n\nMaybe the cast convinced him to do a bigger part, maybe producers finally caught up to his deals and made him be longer in a movie than just appear in it. Maybe he liked the Alien rip-off story. I can't say for sure - what I can say is that the movie - well I've seen way worse. I understand if people are dissapointed and I may be giving this too much slack, but I do like the people in front of the camera.

She could've picked a better film. There's a shootout between the crew and the alien's. She's clearly uncomfortable shooting alien's, Bruce is in his element, and it clearly shows why he's a superstar. The film isn't well written or acted. It's so boring, you could fall asleep. The only time the film really get's going, is near the end. Which makes it worth watching. The ending is intriguing. Don't watch this film because Bruce Willis and Rachel Nichols are in it.

Low budget, poor acting, terrible CGI, awful attempt at an Alien movie.\n\nIts meant to be a colony ship with 1000 people in cryo one of the last 4 ships of the human race going to New Earth. Half way through the movie after a few incidents (and still no mention of the sleeping 1000) Bruce's character pipes up \"we've got to get off this ship\". What about the 1000 poor souls still on it. I managed to get to the 58 minute mark which was pretty good going before turning it off.\n\nMr Willis appears in the whole movie, 2d facial expressions. At least Mr Cage has the good grace to appear for 3 minutes in his movies before doing a runner with the cash. Also why does Johnny Messner have to be in the same movies Bruce appears in, contractual reasons ? Terrible dont watch not even for curiosity."

The sets are cheap, 80s Dr Who looked more convincing, the special effects would look outdated even if they were filmed back in the 80s too.

It actually should have been classified as a comedy because the acting, effects and storyline were just so outrageously comical. I think Thomas Jane made a smart move by allowing his name to be second from the bottom during the credits. Pretty sure Willis and Jane just showed up the day of and were handed the script. They did not act at all, and the remainder of the cast tried to carry the movie. How it has even managed almost 3 stars is actually scary, and shows that some people have depressingly low standards for their entertainment. Pro- tip: avoid this movie like the plague and just watch Alien. I would give this film 0 stars if that was an option. If you are at all still interested in this calamity go read some of the other reviews for the next hour and a half and you would have better entertainment than this film. I feel bad for the people who helped make this film come together because this will follow them forever."

The special effects are horrible. I wouldn't criticise the acting because the dialogue makes a good performance impossible. I actually wouldn't give the film-makers and performers that hard a time because it's clear something somewhere went very badly wrong and that may have been out of their control. The awfulness makes no sense otherwise. I would actually recommend watching it in a way, because although it's not 'funny bad' like The Room it is grimly fascinating as a car crash."

It would be cool if they did it on purpose, but no. The only thing that piques interest is cool actors like Thomas Jane, Timothy Murphy and so on. Callan Mulvey and Bruce Willis look great on confrontation before the fight scenes .. uh .. it's like a school YouTube video. Very bad visuals of shooting, flames, monsters, explosions. I've seen homemade videos of the same or better quality.\n\nMaybe if they focused on the genre of deconstruction with small but high quality effects, it would be a great movie."

Not intentionally funny or entertaining, not full of action or tension.\n\nFor some reason, they also found it funny to insert occasional Alien references and even full scenes, seeing those really hurt me.\n\nI won't say they did not try, but this is clearly the case of \"this looked so much better on paper\" or \"oh, this is how it turned out?\"."

Bruce hasn't been good for thirty going on forty years or whatever year Blade Runner was made. He wasn't even the lead actor in his own sequel. Did I mention Bruce Willis is Old?\n\nHow old is Bruce Willis?\n\n1. Bruce is older grew up on black and white movies with no sound.\n\n2. Bruce once met Jesus seating olives in a carpentry seminar.\n\n3. Bruce planted the first vineyard in Eden.\n\n4. When Bruce writes it can be in Summerian.\n\n5. Bruce booed Copernicus at a Catholic hearing as a flat Earther.\n\nBruce is too old for making movies that are multiple decade old imitations of Aliens with much better actors like Seguorney Williams. And much uglier than her. I could barely watch the trailer of Breach. Apparently Bruce can't let his ego retire him to the local country club of ancient has been, washed up, actors on his millions he's worth. Unless he's broke thsnks to his former cheating wife Dimmy More who seduces very young men in the up and coming actor world.\n\nBreach is a sad tale of talentless writers, poor directors and trashy imitations and bad actors which Hollywood is always doing to satisfy the low morals and desires of movie going peons and Hollywood greed (Rings if Power for example).\n\nD."

        "review_detailed_main": "OMFG. Bruce Willis is an actor that a director has to know how to use to get the best out of. He has the acting chops, comic timing, and a star-quality presence, but to get an audience to buy what Willis is selling, the director has to package it right. This director couldn't wrap a Rubik's cube, let alone a complex beast like Willis, and he clearly couldn't afford a gift bag in which to hide his lack of packaging skills. Hence, Willis comes off as a cheap cardboard cutout, on which the film unfortunately blew the majority of its budget.\n\nThrown in with a discount-store 'junior Colin Farell and Jodie Foster knockoff Chinese Action Figurine' value pack, Willis doesn't even phone it in. In fact, I'm not sure if he even could be gifted with a generous \"he texted it in\". Thomas Jane gets off lightly by spending the great majority of the film in cryosleep - he may be able to wash off his association with this fetid puddle of space horror trope-vomit, given enough time.\n\nThis film lacks any originality, and is so mono-dimensional that any (possible?) attempt to tip its hat to the genre's greats telegraphs desperation, not pizzaz. The sets look like an elementary school cardboard diorama, and nothing is done to meaningfully disguise its low-budget nature. Foley frequently neglects to mask hollow, wooden clunks and thuds on walls and surfaces that should be metal. Lighting is flat and atmosphere-destroying (I've seen better-lit budget 1990s cable soap operas). Colour grading seems to favour uneven, generic \"point and shoot\" settings. Special effects are, well, bad. Some of the monster stuff is actually ok when hidden in the mist, but the ships and space scenes are worse than budget Dr who ships from the 70s, and effects such as muzzle flare look painted in with 80s paintbox technology.\n\nI not sure what this film thinks it is, but it isn't. Urgh. Raw sewage."

The rest of the movie is bad.\n\nThe plot is terrible, the motives and actions of people are idiotic, the villain and monsters are virtually flat. At times this movie feels like a parody, as none of the jokes, or conversations were executed well.\n\nIt just feels cheap on almost all levels. And it's a shame really, because if some of the scenes would have been deleted, a better monster was chosen with some suspense added - this could have been a \"pandorum\" lookalike.\n\nIn general I cannot recommend this to anyone except those few who are hardcore fans of Bruce Willis. All of the rest should avoid this movie.\n\nWith better writing, more suspense and less stupid and forced action this could have been watchable as at times it does feel like a horror movie.

Towards the climax, we see the zombie aliens attain their final form, and this must be the entire special effects budget, because by the end of the film, we've got some kind of stop motion 1933-King Kong lookin garbage, englarged with MS-Paint, and greenscreened into the background under a layer of dense fog.\n\nTrue to form, our heroes never seem to discover any way to kill the zombliens. There's several obvious options they ignore in favor of shooting nerf guns at them (props guy couldn't afford some black spray paint?). Which has the same effect as always when you shoot a zombie in the torso with so many BB-gun rounds.\n\nThe things is a mess from start to finish, and I'm just shaking my head, trying to find out how the director or lead is related to Bruce Willis that he volunteered to be in this."

The writing is bare bones soulless drivel, but that's pretty typical among these low rent scifi movies. To make the poorly paced writing worse, however, is some absolutely awful editing. The first 30 minutes of the movie feels like someone went at it with a chainsaw, leaving you wondering if you dozed off and missed something. It's possible that the script alone may have been merely bad if it had decent editing, rather than truly awful. The walls are papered with flat characters that serve nothing more than to become fodder later. Character motivations are flimsy at best. The camera work is at times passable, and at times seem like someone forgot they were operating a camera. Color grading ranges from jarring and off putting to \"I recognize that preset\". It's so predictable I could have told you the ending at the 30 minute mark. It's entirely forgettable. I just finished watching it about 10 minutes ago and already can't remember any of the character's names.\n\nThis film basically offers nothing memorable or noteworthy, not even brainless action fun. A solid skip in my book. If it's on someone else's dime, perhaps it may be worth the time investment if you just need some background noise."

The metal doors flapping about, the dead guy breathing, almost visible light bulb just outside the window, it's all just a bit tacky. The editing or lack of available scenes is criminal.

I dare say it's not the actors, they did the best with what they had, it's the camerawork. Which is down to the Directing...you see in something like this, there's no need to see the set because it's just the same dull grey/green flat lighting everywhere, you need pools of light to give dark corners, tight, fast, wobbly, whip pan, out of focus shots to give suspense and a feeling of dread. Instead we get static midshot cut to midshot continuously. It's dreadful. There's also no atmosphere and little to no music. With a better Director this could have worked but as is the Director needs to go back to film school and hand in his badge. This isn't his only dull flop of a movie, it seems he specialises in them.

Nothing and I mean absolutely not a single part of this movie is there anything you can be even the slightest bit positive about. It is 100% atrocious and a zero star movie if ever there was one and only a lazy actor who has given up on everything he once believed in would touch this with a barge pole.\n\nTime to retire Mr Willis, you have become an absolute joke, sunk to new depths and might as well just get yourself out of the industry and stop embarrassing your children before they disown you. I can only think this was a job you took so you can get your fix!"

This thing is so lazily written and acted it wishes it was a B-movie.\n\nI have so many questions about this movie that were never explained.\n\nWhat is the extinction event that forced people to leave Earth?\n\nHow did they locate a New Earth, and how did they find the technology to get there, yet don't have the technology to end whatever was going to make the Earth population extinct?\n\nHow did the planet get to a population of 19 billion and still be sustainable during the last 2 centuries without wasting all of Earth's resources with billions dying from it?\n\nWhy does a spaceship whose only purpose is to transit passengers in cryo-stasis need janitors?\n\nWhy is the concentrated cleaning liquid made of acid so strong it can eat through metal, yet no one tells the janitor it could eat through his skin while doing his job?\n\nWhy are the crew still drinking beer in glass bottles over 300 years after they were invented? How many empty bottles are they expecting to get through for the whole crew in 6 months, and where are they going to store them all?\n\nWhy does everyone on the crew look so old and close to death when they are meant to be the last and best of the human population?\n\nWhy does discount Viggo Mortensen have a huge scar on his face, and how bad does society become if they can't heal a scar 222 years from when this movie was made?\n\nWhy is it illegal to make moonshine on the ship, yet the commanders of the ship are aware of this and do nothing about it?\n\nWhy did 3 men who had cornered a guy with guns allow the guy to kill someone before they even start shooting at him?\n\nWhy at 52:26 in does Bruce Willis go from talking, to a wide shot of him standing there with his mouth closed?\n\nWhy does Bruce's character use a flame thrower when they clearly know there's a fire suppression system that's going to shoot gas at them from the ceiling because one person knows it's operational, yet weren't prepared for it and then have to be told to cover their eyes?\n\nWhy does the fire system only work once in one area of the ship, and not at any other time when Bruce is using his flame thrower?\n\nWhy does the plan of the air duct system look like a screensaver from Windows 98?\n\nThe only reason to watch this is if you wanted to see one of Bruce's final roles before he retires with his illness, or if you wanted to make a drinking game out of this, say every time a person attacks someone, every time someone dies, every time Bruce forgets what emotion is. Otherwise, don't waste your time.\n\nIt was so boring that I considered turning it off after 10 minutes, but I'm a completist so I kept it on in the background to see what other wacky things would happen.\n\nIf you must, watch it on Youtube for free, it's definitely not worth paying for."

There's an alien being on board,put there by someone on the crew unhappy with the destruction of earth, and leaving it behind with people dying of a plague.
