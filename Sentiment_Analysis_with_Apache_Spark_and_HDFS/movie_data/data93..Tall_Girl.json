It was mostly people telling us how amazing she is, but all we see is her being down or whinging about something. I would have liked to see the more caring and \"fun\" side. It was stated that she was \"fun\" a few times, but where was that?? It was very choppy in a few bits. Like there were scenes missing that could have added to the experience. There was one part, though, that made me a bit mad, and that was the caesarean part. I haven't had one myself, but that was incredibly offensive to millions of women. It's as though they were made to feel ugly for bringing life into this world and something that usually comes from an emergency. Not cool guys. The rest of the movie was average. In saying that, it was a nice, easy watch when you want to just turn off the brain and watch a Netflix teen romcom."

And sidenote, Sweden is the second best English speaking country for it not being the first language in the world, so a big part of the swedish population doesn't even have an accent. And also - no person in that young age would be named Stig or Ingvar. Those would be the names of 80 years old men. Is it to much to ask for Netflix to get an accent and a name correct? Instead they are lett with a really unbelievable story. G\u00f6r om g\u00f6r r\u00e4tt."

I had a short boyfriend in HS and everyone teased us and made comments, but it just shows how superficial people can be. I finally found my peace with my height and wouldn't want to be any other way! This is a fun movie with a good message and not here to solve world hunger, so just enjoy it for what it is.

Three inches shorter than our protagonist, but still, I think I qualify as a tall girl.\n\nThis movie was both stupid, AND inaccurate.\n\nOn one level, it claims that being a tall girl is one of the worst things on the planet. Let's start by clarifying one thing: tall girls are NOT a marginalized group. To claim so is ridiculous and offensive to marginalized people who actually face discrimination. Aside from that absolute clownery, the plot was predictable, cheesy, and just stupid.\n\nOn top of that, it didn't even get the actual experience of being a tall female right. The one thing they focused on was the \"boy problem\", which isn't even the worst of it. There was a whole shopping/makeover sequence and there wasn't a single joke about jeans turning into capris when you put them on, or putting on a shirt and having to accept it as a crop top. There wasn't anything about looking for shoes by size first, and then deciding if you like the style. The Tall Girl never once had to cram into the small backseat of a car and deal with the lack of leg room, and never was she asked to grab the cereal off the top shelf. Even with the absolute idiocy of claiming tall girls are discriminated against, it didn't even serve as an accurate representation of being one.\n\nThe best thing about this movie is the absolute hilarious criticism it has spawned on Twitter and YouTube, and I'd highly encourage you to seek that instead of watching this dumpster fire."

It is literally what you saw in those Disney Channel movies, the plot is of a girl who suffers bullying because only that is high. It makes me angry to think that jokes are not funny. The whole movie gives special cringe the \"Motivational Message\" it gives and I say it in quotes because it is not motivational. If you want to waste your time do whatever is less watch this movie."

He attempts to get her potentially harmful drugs which could affect her later in life and seemingly continues to prod her for her entire young life about what disease she \"must\" have in order to be so tall and freakish. It is so upsetting to watch a film with such terrible writing and even worse that it continues to isolate those who are on the taller spectrum of height. As a person with a female best friend who is 6'2\", I find this to be a terrible movie plot and I hope Netflix can get its act together and put out more uplifting and inclusive products."

No reason to make a movie with so many stereotypes. No need to make you feel bad for the main character, next time just make a movie with a tall or a short or a skinny or a fat or a normal Girl as the lead role, and make her confident from the beginning."

Life really must suck for her. No, seriously. I felt her solemn sadness. Being an attractive young privileged white girl with a height totalling, and this really takes the biscuit, six foot one really must take its toll. Six. Foot. Frickin'. One. Constantly getting remarks including \"how's the weather up there?\" and being titled \"beanstalk\" shatters the confidence and then some. I'm sure.\n\nUnable to obtain high school love and succeed in life due to her colossal height. Could you imagine being six foot one? Might as well just lobotomise yourself, y'know? Just so abnormal and rare these days. Tall females apparently don't succeed in life. Supermodels? Nope. Olympians? Who? Thank God this wasn't called \"Black Gay Jew\", as if it was treated with the same ill-mannered direction as Tall Girl, it may have been cited as a personal attack. Look, it's a somewhat innocent approach to acquiring self-confidence amidst a wave of pessimism. But when the script hones in on stupidity like cosmetic products inspiring confidence and automatically uplifting exterior beauty, to the point where you become a different person, it's just no! That's not the message we should be sending the next generation!\n\nMore importantly though, let's address the pressing matter here. No one, absolutely no one, gets bullied because of their height. No one! So automatically, there's no relation to the central premise. Never mind the mundane acting, ostentatious directing style and unhumorous dialogue. Those are just rotten ingredients in a disastrous meal. Netflix has, yet again, released another diabolically insulting high school \"comedy\" revolving around popularity and bullying. With a non-sensical reasoning for abuse that cements this as the worst of the year. By far. Six foot one!? Size 13 Men's Nikes!? She's not exactly \"Godzilla\" with clown shoes now, come on!"

What's up with that? -The big twist in the end was just too sudden and it should have happened earlier in the movie. -The ending was just idiotic.

        "review_detailed_main": "It was a great movie, filled with inspiration and EFFECT\n\nI really loved this movie,\n\nThis movie (Tall Girl) was about a girl who struggled with her height (it made her feel self-conscious). So basically she allowed it to overtake her confidence. It also didn't helped that she got teased for it for most of her life especially in high school (typical). Then later in the movie this exchange student came rushing in, and changed the bar for her. She crushed on him, and wanted him. Then it began that she started to get in this fight with this other girl (Kimmy), 'his girlfriend'. Jodi had a lot of empowering friends (Jack) who empowered her to be her unique self and her best friend Fareeda (the feisty one) who kept pushing & pushing & pushing, who had her OWN lifestyle.\n\nThe whole story that I took from it was STAND UP to adversity, because nobody is going to do it for you. She had a really supportive friend, one who bluntly was herself. She was strong willed and kind. She was basically 'the difference' in the whole story, (Fareeda) at least I believe that to be true.\n\nI think it was a very creative intake. When I looked at the cover of the movie, the thumbnail) from both NetFlix and YouTube I wasn't pleased, I felt I wasn't going to like it. It looked shallow to me. But my opinion was changed, when I watched the NetFlix trailer.\n\nThis movie basically teaches that it's okay to be different, that as a matter of fact it's GREAT to be different. I am very blessed to have seen this movie (Tall Girl) and that it was about a unique difference. The tallness thing meant a lot to me, as many abnormal differences would. Use your differences to empower you.\n\nIn this movie, there were a lot of the famous shows actors/actresses in it, and usually I don't care for that or just don't care. Just the people they put in, and how they 'roled' them in was just awesome. I strongly struggle watching this, especially if you feel there is something different about you and you don't like it. Because the truth people (*especially high schoolers) will usually see the worst and point out the difference in you in a very negative area. But please be strong. BE STRONG. Great movie, watch it NOW!"

If you are expecting something with real depth, look elsewhere, because you won't find that here. This film is cheesy and predictable! But that's not necessarily a bad thing. The basis for the plot is a unique one, the acting and direction was good, the soundtrack excellent, and the final scene made me really, really happy, and at-the-end-of-the-dat, isn't that \"ticking all the boxes\"?\n\nI agree with other reviews that perhaps this isn't\"realistic\", but it's not supposed to be!

The direction which was made by Nzingha Stewart was below average and I believe that her movie is for kids between 12 and 16. The interpretations of Ava Michelle who played as Jodi Kreyman, Griffin Gluck who played as Jack Dunkleman and Luke Eisner who played as Stig Mohlin were average and none of them succeed on creating a bond between him/her and the audience.

I have no sympathy for this girl whatsoever, especially considering how terribly she treats everyone around her and how she is constantly complaining about how bad her life is. Maybe the reason you cant find anyone to date isn't because you're tall, but because you literally act like infant. Like were we supposed to feel bad for you? I was genuinely confused. You want to talk about real oppression, make a movie about the people suffering in Afghanistan. Make a movie about trafficking. Make a movie about people experiencing racism. But making a movie about a relatively tall girl who cant find a date to prom because she is oppressed and goes to a school of men who are exclusively under 6 feet tall...? Yall are ridiculous lol.

Basically not essential to the plot line and ruins the point of loving yourself no matter what cause who wants an ugly scar across your belly (face palm).

Being called Sasquatch was a daily thing. Unless you were, the tall girl, I don't think you can actually understand. Always easy to find in a crowd, because you stood two heads over everyone. And for those saying 6'1\" is not that tall, it is when you're the only one around that's that tall. Most likely those people are younger because yes, girls are taller now. But back in the 70s, nope. And if you if you didn't play sports, well... I loved how people always asked if I play/played basketball. Really!

The scene where he goes into her room while she's sleeping is just creepy. He even says that he would wait for her forever even though she didn't want him at all. This movie tells guys everywhere that you can wear a girl down and to never take no for an answer. This guy had even an opportunity to move on with someone that actually liked him, but he wanted what he couldn't have. The dad wasn't much better because he kept basically saying there was something wrong with his daughter the way she is, though at least he realizes his errors.

Her sister is a pageant queen and her mom is shorter and 'pretty' I like the tall girl character, going through bullying myself, but it portrays a very unrealistic harmful view to girls mainly (like me) showing that all your worth is for a guy. Having bad social anxiety, I related to the main girl character who feels single. (doesn't get invited to prom) and gets jealous understandably. I have been in this situation before.\n\nNot really inspiring for females to be single or independent. Showing them 'all you need is a guy to be happy' and the kindest guy in the film didn't even get much attention. It's all about popularity and who's the best. I hated the popular girl who flirts with the new boy and found her soo annoying. She was really nasty as well. I don't think any guy in real life gets flirted with that much. It was sooo dumb. As if an average Swedish guy looks like that, he's a popular actor and gives false representations of men. A lot of good looking men in Sweden are 5'7, so it's putting them to shame."

        "review_detailed_main": "The redeeming part of this movie is the often-witty and enjoyable script. That kept me entertained most of the way through. And overall I enjoyed the film.\n\nHowever, a rather weak ending along with questionable plot elements pretty much knocked it off its perch. First: 6'1\" is indeed a tall girl, and school kids can be very cruel and mean. But every high school basketball team in the nation would be after her... as would any music academy (she was presented as an excellent pianist). So that fact kept sticking out all through the film. (On the other hand, ask anyone who has ever been teased about being short or tall or not the body-idol norm... and they'll verify the experience.) High school can be horrid for those who aren't \"part of the crowd\".\n\nThen there are the cliche characters... such as the older sister who pretty much had no purpose in the film at all. One might consider that between the two she was the actual \"freak\"... but it was a point poorly made and the part badly designed. The incompetent parent shtick, the all-knowing too-wise-for-their-age friends, the somewhat goofy principal... it's been done before. Lots.\n\nBut the biggest letdown (without spoilers) is the last 10 minutes of the movie, where it devolves into rather awful. The \"microphone\" scene was a complete wince moment that made me wonder what the writers were thinking (and what caused them to suddenly plunge to an after-school special mentality). The final few minutes while endearing were not enough to save the movie from what had gone just before. Ouch.\n\nSo all I can give this is a barely-above-mediocre 6 stars. I did find most of the movie entertaining, despite its flaws, but I do wish they'd have landed the ending better. It's like a plane that almost reaches its destination (with a lot of turbulence)... and then crash! Short of the runway."

This movie is terrible, with no redeeming qualities. I had no fun while watching and I couldn't wait for it to end.\n\nThe cinematography is bad, and you can tell no effort really went into it. The colour palettes are dull and the camerawork is lacklustre, the lighting is okay but very unimaginative. Additionally, the editing is too goofy, and not in a charming way. It just comes off as messy and irritating.\n\nThere isn't much to mention when it comes to the sound design, but the original score is terrible and incredibly grating. The soundtrack used is also very unfitting and makes the film feel even more messy.\n\nThe acting is bad from everyone, which isn't helped by the terribly written and dumb dialogue. The main character is extremely unlikable, and her best friend and eventual love interest, Jack, is even worse. Jodi and Jack have absolutely no chemistry, which makes the ending even more ridiculous and infuriating to watch. The writing feels super out of touch when it comes to teenagers and I can't think of anything nice to say about it!\n\nLastly, Tall Girl (2019) is a fast paced mess of a film, and not enjoyable in the slightest. The plot is so dull with no driving force, resulting in a movie that is almost painful to watch. The ending left me angry and I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone."

        "review_detailed_main": "I recently saw the movie, Tall Girl (2019), which is a Netflix rom-com movie. I came to know about this film because it is produced by one of my favourite producers McG who has earlier made films like Charlie's Angels, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle and Terminator Salvation. The movie is a good treat for the teens and college-going class. The film begins with Jodi Kreyman (Ava Michelle), who due to her abnormal height is not able to involve in any sort of relationship with her college mates. Though her role is quite serious, there are moments with a lighter note too. Paris Berelic plays the role of Liz who is Jodi's best friend and serves as a source of constant motivation for her. Sabrina Carpenter plays the role of Jodi's sister and an aspiring model. Griffin Gluck plays the role of Dunkleman who is Jodi's childhood friend and is in love with her. The events of the film take a drastic turn when the second main protagonist, Stig Mohlin (Luke Eisner), a foreign exchange student enter Jodi's college. I would like to mention that the cast does not disappoint us but I still consider it to be a very ordinary project. The storyline too is very ordinary while the screenplay and direction are fine. The matter of the fact is that the movie holds you till the end and does not bore you. If I summarize in two lines, I would say, Tall Girl, is not a movie with depth. It has nothing new or fresh to bring to the genre. I would give this film an average rating of 6 stars and would advise that if you have free time this weekend then give this movie a one-time watch."

Oh yeah, AND her father gave her HIV to go with it?\n\nWell in Tall Girl we have - brace yourself - a girl who's tall. I know, I had trouble processing it too. Game-changing and not for the faint of heart, this brave new movie punches the most terrifying of subject matters: a girl who's taller than her peers. So if you found Precious an uneasy watch, buckle up; Tall Girl surpasses that territory and goes beyond. I mean, she's...TALL, guys! How could anyone face such a reprehensible burden? Sure, it works for supermodels, female athletes and Olympic medallists, but putting them aside, no-one could ever conceive what a traumatic life tall people lead. Kudos to this remarkable film for recognising that long-ignored problem through an uncomfortably candid lens.\n\nJodi's self-inflicted insecurity is something all too many giants suffer from, it's high time they were acknowledged. Just listen to the breath-taking way she reveals at the start of this movie, 'You think your life is hard? I'm a high school junior wearing size-13 trainers. MEN's size-13 trainers. Beat that.' Wow. Preach it, sister. Certainly puts things in perspective, doesn't it? I know the next time I watch Precious, I'll be looking at the titular outcast and thinking, \"Get a grip, girl. So you've been put through years of violent abuse by your own parents, we've all been there. Now the lead star of Tall Girl, on the other hand - talk about untapped. Her classmates keep asking her the lazy, uninspired question, 'How's the weather up there?' Now THAT'S drama! Real problems that people can relate to! Finally, someone out there gets it!\"\n\nGod, I hate my generation."

There were no boys or girls in my high school who were as tall as me. I was not treated very well. If they weren't bulling me then they just avoided me as they saw potential issues with the other kids if they were seen with me. I was not a bad looking girl but I stooped trying to be smaller which didn't help my image. I wanted so much to be shorter. So to the women who have reviewed this movie so disparagingly and to the other who rated so low for other reasons I really don't understand you take. The movie was well acted, the script was good and the message was lovely. I have a 11 year old great niece who loved the movie and the message. I have seen much worse movies that have better reviews than this one so I really wonder at the way this movie has been disparaged. I for one identified with it. I wish I had gone to the prom and spoke up like she did. I wish I had had the guts to join the drama club at high school. I wanted to so much but just couldn't face it. I wondered what I would have been cast as? A boy? This would have been too hard for a 13 year old girl who just wanted to have boys interested in her. Yes I wasn't full of courage but I wasn't and that is sometimes how it is."

        "review_detailed_main": "I honestly could not finish this movie. Got to the one hour and 40 minute mark and decided I had had enough. From the first two minutes you can tell the dialogue is going to be garbage. It felt so inorganic and stale. It was cringe inducing. The \"mean\" jokes towards Jody were painfully embarrassing. \"More like taller Swift,\" lol. Dear God, it didn't even attempt to be creative. What's even worse is the way people reacted to the joke. Like, \"Oh, good one Kimmy.\" Is this real? Is this a real film? I felt like I was watching a parody. Someone actually wrote this, and an entire cast and crew filmed it. THAT IS INSANE!\n\nThe editing was also unbearable. There were so many unnecessary, distracting cuts and glaring continuity errors. Some cuts literally felt like a film student's second attempt at Premiere.\n\nBut by far the movie's worst mistake, its worst sin is, it treats being tall-a universally desired physical trait-like some sort of mayor deformity. In the beginning I though the film was being a little sarcastic and self-aware of its premise, but no. It takes the issue pretty seriously. And the problem doesn't lie in the main character being insecure about her above average height. You can have a pretty good movie about an attractive, tall character who is just insecure and unsure of herself. The problem lies in the way everyone reacts to her height. It's just not realistic in the slightest. You have an attractive main character with the physical attributes of a model, and everyone around her acts like she's Godzilla. I'm sorry, I just didn't buy it.\n\nOne thing the movie did right was her parents. It makes perfect sense that Jody would be so insecure with such a knucklehead of a father. If the movie had gone that route and focused more on the theme of her dad's insecurities affecting her self esteem, I think we would have a much better movie. Problem is, the movie doesn't understand subtlety, so it's not just her parents and one or two jerks here and there that have a problem with her tallness; it's EVERYONE. And I know the actress that played Jody had a rough time because of her height, but come on. An entire high school acting like they've never seen someone above five feet-in the United States of America, no less-is a bit of a stretch.\n\nIn conclusion, I did not enjoy this movie. It was boring, the characters were flat, I didn't feel the slightest bit of sympathy for the main character, the guy she ends up with is a manipulative creep, and it's just a bad movie all around. It's not even the premise. It's the way it's executed."

I was expecting her to be closer to 7 feet tall under the circumstances but she's 6'1? Seriously?\n\nHer dad considered having her hormones suppressed while she was very young even though one of the side effects is infertility. That's too far which sets the pace of how ridiculous she's treated because of her height when it's not even that tall.\n\nThey seemed to go out of their way to cast short people because she's way taller than everyone, guys included, at only 6'1. They must not have any basketball teams at her school or her city/town for that matter.\n\nIt would have been more relatable or realistic if she was just the tallest girl, which is what I was expecting. Her shoe size and all that isn't that hard to accommodate these days because of internet shopping too. They made it seem impossible but it would have been more believable if her frustration was because she can only order from online and not off the rack but no. They implied she can't get anything anywhere since she wears a 13 in men's. My oldest wears a 15 and I could get him shoes even at Walmart so I'm confused lol\n\nHer friend loves her the way that she is and she overlooks that because he's shorter than her (and most people). How ironic is it that she judges him for his height when she hates that she is?\n\nThey miss the mark so many times and ways. It's frustrating because it had potential. Her families obsession with beauty and what THEY deem normal was gross and unnecessary. I cringed at most of what they said and did, ugh."

It was obvious they wanted this exact person to play the role, because of her fame beforehand on \"Dance Moms\", knowing they would attract the fan base. Also, the other characters weren't written well, with the stereotypical best friend of a quiet girl and a boy who's madly in love with someone who doesn't even notice. The movie tried to make being taller a good thing, but it backfired terribly, achieving the opposite."

And as this movie is taking place in the US; where the heck are all tall people? I mean there's a great diversity in the States. Second, tall people aren't getting bullied as much as short people, on the contrary! My friends who are under 160 cm get bullied and they are discriminated like not being able to work as a flight attendant etc; and as we all know short people are having more difficulties in general getting a good job etc etc - all top ranked CEO's are tall. Really weird that Jodi's sister is a beauty pageant being 152 cm - that's very very short and absolutely too short for a beauty contestant. So even though tall girls can get bullied when young it's nothing comparing to how short women get treated in their lives. Second, this \"swedish\" guy Stig (Stig and Ingvar aren't at all common today except for old men around 70) doesn't even speak swedish and his accent doesn't sound at all swedish, more like a weird german maybe. But I have to say that I almost laughed when Stig talked about not being tall or even good looking comparing to other swedish guys in general - if you come to Sweden with this idea you'll be very very disappointed!"

And by the way---why are so many reviews REPEATED over and over---WEIRD.\n\nI loved it. Anyone that wasn't in the most popular crowd in High School can probably relate. The Tall Girl is representative of all the non athletic, tubby, too short, freckled, somewhat pimply or just not socially hip kids. Which is to say the MAJORITY.\n\nThe movie is pretty straight forward. Not difficult to follow. I CAN'T say the same for the reviews!\n\nCompliments to the cast. I think they did a great job with a script that isn't John Hughes at his best but is moving and heartfelt.\n\nAre producers supposed to stop making teen films because they may not be as good as 'Breakfast Club'???\n\nIf you're softhearted, watch it.

Don't get me started with that \"quirky\" crate thing that was supposed to turn into this \"cute\" stroke of genius moment at the very end. So predictable and just awful.\n\nNot only are the characters and acting terrible, the whole concept of this movie is idiotic, people don't get bullied for their height, that doesn't happen. I'm a very tall girl, always the tallest in class, taller than my older siblings, and I love it. Being tall is great, that shouldn't be a \"movie screen realisation\"."

The one good thing about it is the older sister who gets the only good lines - but the fact that she's a beauty queen doesn't exactly break the feminist mould.

The fact that she needed the boys and everyone else to realise her is just a little sociopathical and she is such a horrible friend! And the make out scene is REALLY culty. Has anyone realised that she actually isn't that tall? They hired shorter actors, for example, Sabrina carpenter that plays Harper is actually 1.5m tall. Also they use low camera angles to make her look taller and higher camera angles to make everyone else look smaller. I admire that the actor Ava overcame her height issues and that is great but I think that making a cringey movie about it is a bit too much. The most generic American movie I have ever seen."

Feeling left out and just wanting to find someone she can connect with, in comes exchange student Stig Mohlin (Luke Eisner) who shares a similar height. Jodi who doesn't seem to have any other goals in the film, drops everything including her friends to try win over the handsome exchange student.\n\nI honestly don't know what the message was in this film... Like I get the simple message at the end, but it was done in such a poor form. Jodi ditched her only friends, and went out of her way to look good for a guy to notice her. Are we trying to teach kids that if school students are making fun of how you look, you should up your game with new clothes and makeup so people look at you in a more respectful way? The way Jodi treated her two friends was so bad. They always had her back and Jodi was so quick to turn away from them when she didn't like what was she hearing.\n\nThe ending is cute, but yeah the messages are so bipolar and all over the place."

It's a fast pacing movie. However, the script is as if it were written by a twelve-year old. The main characther constantly repeats how much of a freak she is in conversations that have nothing to do with this topic. Overall, I don't see a person above the age of 14 enjoying this. I would've given the movie a lower rating if it weren't for the ending, which I honestly thought was quite cute."

Her emotions rang true and her personality underwent no drastic changes despite a spectacularly unrealistic ending.\n\nAlso, I give the film makers credit for doing a high school movie sans jocks and cheerleaders. However, therein also lies a chunk of the false premise the script is built on: that tall girls in 2019 are outcasts.\n\nSince the advent of Title IX in the 1970s, as opportunities for girls to play sports increased and female students were drawn to taking part, height became a desired trait to many at any high school. Basketball -- Jodi does reference people calling her \"Lebron\" but doesn't seem to be on the Ruby Bridges High team -- volleyball, swimming, track and field all prize height at certain positions or events. As girls and boys grow up together watching each other in sports, there is nothing \"freakish\" about a 6-1 or 6-2 girl.\n\nMy late wife (high school class of '82) was 6-1, our daughter (class of '12) 6-feet even. Neither took any crap for their height. Both played basketball. but I think their acceptance came more from being part of a team which also featured other tall girls than the fact they were both pretty good.\n\nI realize not all girls, tall or short, play sports, but Jodi's one professed interest -- playing piano -- is said to be something she is suited for because of her wide hands. The current reduction -- I would never say elimination because people at schools all across the country are still bullied for many traits -- in harassment of tall girls is partially a product of many taking part in activities where their height is a plus. Tall girls who are \"ordinary students\" aren't automatically thought of as freaks if those who do play sports or model or whatever all else fields are now more open to tall women are not."

I play volleyball and I'm the 5th tallest one on the team. My middle is 6'4\" and she is praised for being that tall. The story line sucks but the acting also sucks. The only reason the movie is trending is because it's a Netflix original and of course Netflix is gonna make their own movies trending. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! Also they literally make her look like a giant. Everybody looks like 5'2\" next to her. The camera angles are super deceptive."

It's about Jody's journey, her story, and her experiences with bullying. Maybe you weren't bullied because of your height, but that doesn't mean it never happened for someone else. The idea is this film is addressing bullying, period. Do the teenagers say stupid things at time like stuff about C-sections? Yes, but that's pretty realistic cause real teenagers say stupid insensitive stuff all the time. And as for the Swedish accent being terrible, who CARES?! That's your concern?! You can't enjoy a film because the accent isn't perfect?! Critical snowflakes lol.\n\nMovie review: personally, I enjoyed this movie a lot. Were there a lot of movies tropes? Sure. But I really enjoyed the relationship that had been developing between two of the leads. The music was modern and much of it was something you haven't heard before which is refreshing from the stereotypical highschool drama soundtrack. In the end, if you can manage to see this movie for what it has to offer and not make it all about you or your sensitivities, it's a fun, light hearted, and enjoyable movie."

Like for real... how pretentious do you have to be to be watching a movie such as this and be sitting there critiquing the accents?! Lol I am 29 and I am not tall but I totally empathized with the character, and as an adult, enjoyed all of the fun and clever humour. It was a great mix of deep enough and cheesy enough to be a really awesome show so don't listen to the reviews and just relax with some tea, chill out and watch it!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Jodi (Ava Michelle) is a teenage girl who has always had a difficult time at school. This is due to her being the tallest girl in her school and she is constantly discriminated against. After years of keeping her head low, this story captures her rise in confidence with the help of her two best friends Jack and Fareeda (Griffin Gluck and Anjelika Washington) and her sister Harper (Sabrina Carpenter) who show her just how beautiful she really is and how her insecurities will not define her. I really enjoyed this one from start to finish and this was mainly due to the fantastic performances from everyone involved. Michelle is a very strong central performer and she does a wonderful job in engaging the viewer from the very start in Jodi's story. Gluck is also brilliant as Jack who is madly in love with Jodi and the romance of this grows even better through the runtime. I was surprised to read so many negative reviews after catching this on Netflix; a lot of people found the approach of the film offensive or just extremely unfunny. I couldn't disagree more; I think it's a very honest film that handles its subject matter well while creating a good role model in its central character and portraying the abuse that comes from high school unsettlingly well. A big shout out to 'warthenee' and 'tallgirl-45656' who have stood up for Tall Girl on IMDB and related their own experiences to their emotional investment in the film. Lay back and enjoy!"

I might not be a Tall Girl like Jodi but I have spent the last few months learning to love myself, accept myself as me, learn and grow with people who will love me for my heart. I am usually not a huge movie person, but this movie was so empowering and heartwarming that it suddenly became one of my favourite movies. After watching \"Tall Girl\" I fell asleep feeling so happy and lifted as if someone had just come to me and said \"It's gonna be ok. You'll get through it.\" I would recommend this movie to any girls between 12-25, who feel like they are not good enough, feel alone and want something to comfort them.\n\nHere's a quick summary of the plot: 16-year-old Jodi is insecure about her height as she is taller than all the boys at school. Jack likes Jodi and wants to go out with her but she refuses because she doesn't want to date someone shorter than her. When a tall and hot Swedish exchange student, Stig, joins the school, every girl wants him. He ends up dating the popular girl, Kimmy. Soon after, Jack finds out that his family is hosting Stig. These two things cause many complications for Jodi. WATCH THE MOVIE TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS!!!"

The girl is first portrayed as a plain Jane type but by the end her natural beauty & humility shows her very attractive.

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't understand why there're a lot of bad rewiews. Personally I liked it. Well, maybe it's because when I'm watching film I'm trying to catch the feelings put in it rather than notice every detail here and there. And I caught it perfectly, even cried some times because I know what bullying is like in real life. So, if you're wondering whether to watch it or not, I suggest you to watch it. It's not that bad at all, believe me."

BUT, the odd movie that isn't my typical watch I decided to take a peak see how first 20 mins were cause there's nothing else on and I was glad I did cause Wow first off I decided to check it out cause of Steve Zahan who rarely makes movies anymore and then I got hooked from beginning to end. The girl Jodi is sweet, cute and funny she plays the perfect role not just for her height but because she's meant for this part it's like they wrote it just for her. Definitely worth a watch even if it isn't your type it's just that good. It leaves you wanting more."
