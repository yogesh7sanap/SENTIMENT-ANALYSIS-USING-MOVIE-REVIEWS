Yes, the cinematography is great, the acting is second to none, but how many eternal lines of dialogue came from this? 'Here's looking at you, kid,' 'This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship,' 'We'll always have Paris,' 'Round up the usual suspects,' 'The problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world,' 'I'm shocked to find out that gambling is going on,' 'Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine'.\n\nAs much as I prefer a happy ending, I'm gonna go ahead and say the ending felt perfect. It had to go that way. I think I'll end by saying Humphrey Bogart just might be the most watchable actor in cinematic history."

Casablanca, an amazing story on friendship love and patriotism is one of the best movies I've seen. Magnificent as always , Humphrey Bogart played Rick a saloon owner in Casablanca , an unoccupied region in France during the WW2. His ex lover Ilsa now wife to Victor Lazlo an escaped prisoner of the Nazis come to the saloon owned by Rick in fortuity. With no other choice but to seek help from her ex lover Ilsa tries to persuade Rick to help Victor escape the german to America. I was infatuated by the performance of Ingrid Bergman who plays Ilsa. She was an absolute peach with her amazing yet painful dialogues. Casablanca will always be a monumental work in the history of the cinemas."

        "review_detailed_main": "There are literally hundreds of comments about this movie on IMDB. Many of them exhort its greatness. I don't disagree with them.\n\nBut I'd like to add a suggestion to those of you out there who haven't seen this film. I'd like to tell you HOW to watch it.\n\nThe people who made this movie didn't think they were producing a masterpiece. Bergman left the shoot disgusted. The screenwriters were on salary for Warners, writing half a dozen movies a year, and this was just one more. Bogie was punching the clock in the middle of a workhorse career.\n\nSo as an audience member, you can't sit down expecting gilded greatness.\n\nDon't have a Casablaca party. Don't watch it on your first date, hoping it will lend that \"Romantic Touch.\" Don't watch it as part of your \"I need to watch the Best 10 movies of all time\" Film School project.\n\nBuy this movie on DVD. Have it at the ready. And then, one Friday night, when your plans fall through and you find it's 10:30pm and there's nothing on TV that's any good, open a six pack of beer, or pour yourself some wine, and watch this movie in a darkened room.\n\nThe characters in Casablanca are absolutely devoid of sentimentalism. Every one of them sees the world without a hint of rose color in their lenses. As Rick says, \"Three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this big old world.\" If you're in a mood where you understand what he's saying, watch this movie and it will transport you.\n\nThere is no single movie that deserves to be called the best movie of all time. Because movies, when all is said and done, don't amount to a hill of beans. They are meant to entertain us, not for us to worship THEM.\n\nBut no movie has ever known this fact like Casablanca.\n\nIf you watch Casablance this way, with no expectations, with no \"hype,\" you might catch 10 percent of its greatness on one viewing. And that will be enough to start you on your way.\n\nHappy viewing, kid."

        "review_detailed_main": "There is a scene about halfway through the movie Casablanca that has become commonly known as 'The Battle of the Anthems' throughout the film's long history. A group of German soldiers has come into Rick's Caf\u00e9 American and are drunkenly singing the German National Anthem at the top of their voice. Victor Lazlo, the leader of the French Resistance, cannot stand this act and while the rest of the club stares appalled at the Germans, Lazlo orders the band to play 'Le Marseilles (sic?)' the French National Anthem. With a nod from Rick, the band begins playing, with Victor singing at the top of HIS voice. This in turn, inspires the whole club to begin singing and the Germans are forced to surrender and sit down at their table, humbled by the crowd's dedication. This scene is a turning point in the movie, for reasons that I leave to you to discover.\n\nAs I watched this movie again tonight for what must be the 100th time, I noticed there was a much smaller scene wrapped inside the bigger scene that, unless you look for it, you may never notice. Yvonne, a minor character who is hurt by Rick emotionally, falls into the company of a German soldier. In a land occupied by the Germans, but populated by the French, this is an unforgivable sin. She comes into the bar desperately seeking happiness in the club's wine, song, and gambling. Later, as the Germans begin singing we catch a glimpse of Yvonne sitting dejectedly at a table alone and in this brief glimpse, it is conveyed that she has discovered that this is not her path to fulfillment and she has no idea where to go from there. As the singing progresses, we see Yvonne slowly become inspired by Lazlo's act of defiance and by the end of the song, tears streaming down her face, she is singing at the top of her voice too. She has found her redemption. She has found something that will make her life never the same again from that point on.\n\nBasically, this is Casablanca in a nutshell. On the surface, you may see it as a romance, or as a story of intrigue, but that is only partially correct.\n\nThe thing that makes Casablanca great is that it speaks to that place in each of us that seeks some kind of inspiration or redemption. On some level, every character in the story receives the same kind of catharsis and their lives are irrevocably changed. Rick's is the most obvious in that he learns to live again, instead of hiding from a lost love. He is reminded that there are things in the world more noble and important than he is and he wants to be a part of them. Louis, the scoundrel, gets his redemption by seeing the sacrifice Rick makes and is inspired to choose a side, where he had maintained careful neutrality. The stoic Lazlo gets his redemption by being shown that while thousands may need him to be a hero, there is someone he can rely upon when he needs inspiration in the form of his wife, who was ready to sacrifice her happiness for the chance that he would go on living. Even Ferrai, the local organized crime leader gets a measure of redemption by pointing Ilsa and Lazlo to Rick as a source of escape even though there is nothing in it for him.\n\nThis is the beauty of this movie. Every time I see it (and I have seen it a lot) it never fails that I see some subtle nuance that I have never seen before. Considering that the director would put that much meaning into what is basically a throw away moment (not the entire scene, but Yvonne's portion) speaks bundles about the quality of the film. My wife and I watched this movie on our first date, and since that first time over 12 years ago, it has grown to be, in my mind, the greatest movie ever made."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Casablanca\" remains Hollywood's finest moment, a film that succeeds on such a vast scale not because of anything experimental or deliberately earthshaking in its design, but for the way it cohered to and reaffirmed the movie-making conventions of its day. This is the film that played by the rules while elevating the form, and remains the touchstone for those who talk about Hollywood's greatness.\n\nIt's the first week in December, 1941, and in the Vichy-controlled African port city of Casablanca, American ex-pat Rick Blaine runs a gin joint he calls \"Rick's Cafe Americaine.\" Everybody comes to Rick's, including thieves, spies, Nazis, partisans, and refugees trying to make their way to Lisbon and, eventually, America. Rick is a tough, sour kind of guy, but he's still taken for a loop when fate hands him two sudden twists: A pair of unchallengeable exit visas, and a woman named Ilsa who left him broken-hearted in Paris and now needs him to help her and her resistance-leader husband escape.\n\nHumphrey Bogart is Rick and Ingrid Bergman is Ilsa, in roles that are archetypes in film lore. They are great parts besides, very multilayered and resistant to stereotype, and both actors give career performances in what were great careers. He's mad at her for walking out on him, while she wants him to understand her cause, but there's a lot going on underneath with both, and it all spills out in a scene in Rick's apartment that is one of many legendary moments.\n\n\"Casablanca\" is a great romance, not only for being so supremely entertaining with its humor and realistic-though-exotic wartime excitement, but because it's not the least bit mushy. Take the way Rick's face literally breaks when he first sees Ilsa in his bar, or how he recalls the last time he saw her in Paris: \"The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.\" There's a real human dimension to these people that makes us care for them and relate to them in a way that belies the passage of years.\n\nFor me, and many, the most interesting relationship in the movie is Rick and Capt. Renault, the police prefect in Casablanca who is played by Claude Rains with a wonderful subtlety that builds as the film progresses. Theirs is a relationship of almost perfect cynicism, one-liners and professions of neutrality that provide much humor, as well as give a necessary display of Rick's darker side before and after Ilsa's arrival.\n\nBut there's so much to grab onto with a film like this. You can talk about the music, or the way the setting becomes a living character with its floodlights and Moorish traceries. Paul Henreid is often looked at as a bit of a third wheel playing the role of Ilsa's husband, but he manages to create a moral center around which the rest of the film operates, and his enigmatic relationship with Rick and especially Ilsa, a woman who obviously admires her husband but can't somehow ever bring herself to say she loves him, is something to wonder at.\n\nMy favorite bit is when Rick finds himself the target of an entreaty by a Bulgarian refugee who just wants Rick's assurance that Capt. Renault is \"trustworthy,\" and that, if she does \"a bad thing\" to secure her husband's happiness, it would be forgivable. Rick flashes on Ilsa, suppresses a grimace, tries to buy the woman off with a one-liner (\"Go back to Bulgaria\"), then finally does a marvelous thing that sets the whole second half of the film in motion without much calling attention to itself.\n\nIt's not fashionable to discuss movie directors after Chaplin and before Welles, but surely something should be said about Michael Curtiz, who not only directed this film but other great features like \"Captain Blood\" and \"Angels With Dirty Faces.\" For my money, his \"Adventures Of Robin Hood\" was every bit \"Casablanca's\" equal, and he even found time the same year he made \"Casablanca\" to make \"Yankee Doodle Dandy.\" When you watch a film like this, you aren't so much aware of the director, but that's really a testament to Curtiz's artistry. \"Casablanca\" is not only exceptionally well-paced but incredibly well-shot, every frame feeling well-thought-out and legendary without distracting from the overall story.\n\nCurtiz was a product of the studio system, not a maverick like Welles or Chaplin, but he found greatness just as often, and \"Casablanca,\" also a product of the studio system, is the best example. It's a film that reminds us why we go back to Hollywood again and again when we want to refresh our imaginations, and why we call it \"the dream factory.\" As the hawker of linens tells Ilsa at the bazaar, \"You won't find a treasure like this in all Morocco.\" Nor, for that matter, in all the world."

        "review_detailed_main": "Spoilers ahead, but then again, who isn't familiar with Casablanca, even if one hasn't seen it?\n\nI've been watching 'Casablanca' over and over again since I bought the Special Edition DVD, and is there any film out there one can watch again and again without ever being tired of it? And does any film appeal to a broader audience? Just everything about it seems to be as close to perfection as it only can be.\n\nBut what exactly is so special about it? Is it its great genre mix, never equaled by another film? When we think of 'Casablanca' first, we remember it as a romantic film (well, most of us do). But then again, its also a drama involving terror, murder and flight. One can call it a character study, centering on Rick. And there are quite a few moments of comedic delight, just think of the pickpocket (\"This place is full of vultures, vultures everywhere!\") or the elderly couple on the last evening before their emigration to the US (\"What watch?\").\n\nBut 'Casablanca' is not only great as a whole, it still stands on top if we break it apart and look at single lines of dialog, scenes or performances alone. Is there any other film which has more quotable dialog than 'Casablanca'? 'Pulp Fiction' is on my mind here, and 'All About Eve' and 'Sunset Blvd.' come close, too, but still I think 'Casablanca' tops everything else. And not only is the dialog great, it's unforgettably delivered, especially by Humphrey Bogart (\"I was misinformed.\") and Claude Rains (\"I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on here\"). Many of scenes have become a part of film history; the duel of 'Die Wacht am Rhein' and 'La Marseillaise' is probably one of the greatest scenes ever shot (the only I can think of that would rival it for the #1 spot is Hynkel and the globe from Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator'), and the last scene is probably even familiar to the few people who've never seen 'Casablanca'. Am I the only one who is absolutely convinced that the film wouldn't have become what it is today if Rick and Ilsa would have ended up as the lucky couple?\n\nAbout the performances: So much has been said about the uniqueness of Humphrey Bogart's and Ingrid Bergman's chemistry as Rick and Ilsa, about Claude Rains' terrific turn as Renault, about the scene-stealing performances by Peter Lorre (one of the 10 all-time greatest actors) as Ugarte and Sydney Greenstreet as Ferrari and about Dooley Wilson stopping the show as Sam. I'd love to emphasize here two other performances, one that is not mentioned quite as often and one which is blatantly overlooked: Conrad Veidt as Major Strasser had a really difficult task here, as his character is the only evil one, but still Strasser is not a one-dimensional character, and it took more than 50 years until another actor gave an equally (maybe even more) impressive performance as a Nazi, Ralph Fiennes in 'Schindler's List'. But why no one ever mentions S. K. Sakall, who plays Carl, the jolly waiter at Rick's Caf\u00e9 Am\u00e9ricain, is beyond me. He has definitely more screen time than Lorre, Greenstreet and Wilson, and probably about as much as Veidt, and he's a joy whenever he's on the screen. I simply love his reaction when the pickpocket (\"Vultures everywhere!\") accidentally bumps into him, or the reaction to the \"What watch\"-dialog. Or how he says he gave Strasser the best table, \"being a German, he would have taken it anyway\". His performance is simply criminally overlooked.\n\nSo is there a weakest link in 'Casablanca'? Every film, no matter how close to perfection, has a minor flaw or two, so one can find them in 'Casablanca', too, if one really tries hard. So yes, one might ask how much sense the entire mumbo jumbo about the letters of transit makes. One might point out that Paul Henreid, although his performance is certainly good, doesn't come close to the greatness of any of his co-stars. However, the film is so close to perfection that I'm almost ashamed that I'm so desperately trying to find less-than-perfect elements.\n\nSo whatever films will come, how many sequels will overflow the screen, and how much junk we will have to sit through, one thing is certain if we're desperate to see a great film: We'll always have Casablanca!"

This would provide sufficient material for hundreds of movies, but enter Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, magnificent cinematography, role model storytelling, a perfect supporting cast, some of the best dialogue ever commited to celluloid and Dooley Wilson singing THAT song, and history was made. More than 60 years of jaw-drops are sufficient to give the sceptics a good reason to make them understand that this is probably the greatest classic movie of all times, and one of the best ever made in the past, present and future."

There are probably quite a few details that I didn't notice, but I don't think you should have to google \"why is Casablanca great\" to understand the hype surrounding the film.\n\nDo not misunderstand me. It was good. It was actually very good from time to time. Stylish environments and lovely vibes. However, I think that the explanations for why the film is good are rather reasons why the film is even better than what you already thought. Should a film really require so much analysis and thought? Yes, a movie like this might need it.\n\nI tried to see the film with an extra critical and objective eye. The plot is good, the characters are nuanced and many good questions are asked. The main character has had his heart broken and his ideologies have changed. It's an interesting premise. It's all good on paper and I imagine the film was a great when it came out during WWII. Can you imagine that? 80 years ago. There are people in this who were born in the 19th century. That is certainly interesting.\n\nIn conclusion, I was surprised that it was quite good, but I didn't really like it. It's undeniably a pretty good movie, but is it overrated? In my eyes? Yes, I would say so. Is it just because of the outdated technology? No, the plot wasn't very complex and the moral dilemma the whole thing was about is nowhere near groundbreaking today. Maybe it was 80 years ago but how do I know."

Many of these live up to their name (Zulu, Singin' In The Rain, Ben-Hur). I found Casablanca to be boring overlong and poorly acted. While the work of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergmen may have been good for it's time it is insufficient compared to todays advanced standards. The settings are dull and rather unimaginative.\n\nSure, you \"Cinematic Elite\" may like it, but is \"Casablanca\" really the kind of movie that would appeal to the average person at their local cinema.

It seems like every time I see this film I notice something new. This time it had to do with the Bulgarian woman, Annina Brandel, who Rick rescues from the carnal plotting of Captain Renault. I never gave this scene much thought, just assuming that it was a way to plumb the limits of Rick's cynicism, as noted above. But later, during the scene where Ilsa tells Rick that she'll stay with him if he will use the letters of transit for Laszlo, I realized that the two scenes were a common theme, that Rick realizes he'd be no different from Renault if he followed through with that. I guess one gets lazy seeing modern Hollywood fare. Nowadays, the director would have used a flashback image or something, in order to bludgeon the viewer with the correlation. But back then, with a better-educated public, one could allow audiences to discover things for themselves. It was also skillful how these films could be more or less suitable for children, as well as adults. When I saw this film as a child, it never occurred to me that Rick and Ilsa had had sex. But the clues, while too subtle for a child, were pretty obvious to me as a man. Like many people this film is my all-time favorite. Grade: A+++++"

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is a monumental piece of film history. I can honestly it might just be one of the best movies of all time. If anything, you have to acknowledge the writing. Almost every single line of dialogue in the film is a household terminology to this day, most people paying tribute to the film without even knowing it. That's why I wanted to use a less popular quote for the title, and it has its own meanings within the film. Another joy of the film is composer Max Steiner; yes, Max Steiner of 1933's \"King Kong\". His music is timeless, and he captures the mystery and romance of the film perfectly.\n\nIt's definitely a love story at a glance, one of the best ever told if not so, but I view it more as a story of sacrifice, on the part of both lovers. The film is also a piece of history, taking place during the Second World War It entails a time when the Third Reich's immense shadow was cast over all of Europe, and the film portrays this quite nicely. However the film is about more than Charlie Chaplin poking fun at the Nazi Party (gotta love Chaplin). There is quite a bit of nicely done comedy within the weaving of it all, but it's balanced just right.\n\nI'm not sure if it qualifies as a film noir exactly, but Rick (Humphrey Bogart) is cynical enough to fit the bill and the use of shadows is quite extraordinary. The setting and lighting during the best scenes of the movie are darkened rooms, making it all the more intense. As I said before, Rick, with his sarcasm and pessimism, is one of my favorite characters of all time. To me the movie is about him most of all. He sees the events taking place before him, knows he must act, but for a while chooses not to. The beauty of it all is that we know why and we feel for him.\n\nAll the performances are incredible. Like all golden era Hollywood flicks of the 50s, it draws our attention without the use of bloodshed and sexuality. Although don't be mistaken, it is indeed used here and very subtly I add. Its takes a film lover's eyes and ears to catch it, and the story telling is just marvelous.\n\nOne cannot be a true fan of cinema without having seen \"Casablanca\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's one of the great Hollywood legends how George Raft helped make Humphrey Bogart a leading man by turning down in succession, High Sierra, The Maltese Falcon, and Casablanca. Maybe Raft showed some good sense in letting a better actor handle those roles. In any event we've got some proof in the case of Casablanca.\n\nCheck out some time a film called Background to Danger that Warner Brothers did with George Raft that also featured Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. Had Raft ever done Casablanca the film would have been a routine action/adventure story just like Background to Danger. Instead with Bogey we get that, but also one of the great love stories of the century.\n\nHumphrey Bogart set the standard for playing expatriate American soldiers of fortune in Casablanca. Right now he's between wars running Rick's Cafe Americain in Casablanca in Morocco, an area controlled for the moment by the Vicky French government. He's got his fingers in a whole lot of pies, but Bogey operates with his own code of ethics. He sticks his neck out for nobody.\n\nNobody except the great love of his life Ingrid Bergman who left him mysteriously in Paris as he was fleeing the oncoming German occupation. She walks back into his life with a husband, Paul Henreid who is a well known anti-fascist leader.\n\nThe rest of the film is a contest for Bogey's soul. Torn between his great love, his own anti-fascist beliefs, and certain practical necessities of operating a liquor and gaming establishment in a hostile environment.\n\nSo many things combine to make Casablanca the great film it is. Ingrid Bergman's lovely incandescence melding and melting Bogey's cynical screen persona. The indelible characterizations of Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt and the whole rest of a 100% perfectly cast film. And the revival of a great ballad which serves as Casablanca's theme song.\n\nI say revival because As Time Goes By was introduced in 1931 in the George White Scandals on Broadway by Rudy Vallee. He made a record of it which sold quite a few disks back then. But by the merest of coincidences there was a strike that lasted two years that just began around the time Casablanca came out. The Musicians Union struck against the record companies. With no new records being made RCA Victor re-released Vallee's record and it became a monster hit on revival.\n\nAlso when Casablanca came out as if the White House had a personal interest in the film FDR and Churchill had the first of their wartime conferences in----Casablanca of all places. Jack Warner must have said a prayer for that to happen.\n\nThere are so many classic scenes and lines from Casablanca you can write a comment just by listing them. But my favorite has always been when the Germans have taken over Rick's place and are singing some of their songs, Paul Henreid goes to orchestra leader and asks him to lead La Marsellaise. With a nod from Bogey, the orchestra plays, Henreid leads them and the rest of the non-Germans in the cafe join in. Over 60 years later, one still gets a thrill from that act of defiance.\n\nBogart and Rains were nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. Any of the others could have been as well. As I said before Casablanca is perfectly cast right down to minor roles like Curt Bois as a pickpocket, John Qualen as a fellow resistance leader, and S.Z. Sakall as a waiter at Rick's. If there was an award for ensemble cast, Casablanca would have won it. As it was it did win for Best Picture of 1943 and best director for Michael Curtiz.\n\nCasablanca will be seen and loved by filmgoers for generations unto infinity, as time goes by."

        "review_detailed_main": "Casablanca (1942)\n\nWhen Rick (the inimitable Bogart) says to Sam (the inimitable Dooley Wilson), \"If it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?\" he's announcing to everyone that this is a movie about Pearl Harbor. That is, it is about this hardboiled, pre-noir American type, who sticks his neck out for no one, and his growing need to go to war.\n\nNeed and desire. That's part of the compelling mood of the movie--everything feels like it has to be so. Americans are (by implication) really good at heart, and of course we'll come to the air of pretty Norwegians trapped by love and reluctant Frenchmen trapped by circumstance and all those very interesting lovable refugees (some real refugee actors), trapped by Nazi meanness and brutality, plain and simple.\n\nThe romance? That, in a way, is the MacGuffin, not the other way around. Certainly, the famous end to the movie leaves the romance in the dust. Casablanca is a call to arms, for all the best reasons, and it appeals across the decades, too. In fact, the movie premiered on Thanksgiving, 1942, so the U.S. is fully in the war by the time people see it. And it resonates as a confirmation, and almost as prescient. We trust Bogart, by now, to be the right kind of man in every circumstance, just like our own men, husbands, fathers, brothers on the field.\n\nThese great things don't make the movie great. Not as a movie. The writing, above all, does that (the Epsteins labored and were as inspired as they were gifted in this, with Howard Koch). But the filming is gorgeous, every scene filled with dense layers foreground to back, including layers of light, and often moving light, from searchlights and passing cars, or in the caf\u00e9 as the lights move from piano to band and so on. Actors move across the screen in fluid conversation, sometimes for a laugh, often for a drink, eventually to see Rick, or to fret about getting out, getting to Lisbon, getting to America. It's all idealized and frightening at the same time. The bit actors are astonishing, the direction by the seasoned but unexceptional Curtiz is compact and elegant. Bogart is perfect.\n\nThere isn't much to say new, or old, that's worth the time here, with everything out there so well said already. Just Google the movie and read away. Or better yet, watch it again. If you think you've seen the movie enough, look beyond plot and really listen to the writing, and watch the camera-work and lights. It's not a great film by accident, and it doesn't hide why it's great. There are better films, I suppose, of course there are, depending who you ask and on what day. But not many."

It is to experience lives that have never been lived - but are \"real to you.\" It is to know pain and joy, pride and pity for characters that are a fiction - yet are so real that you can't help but get lost in their story.\n\nAmazing cast, memorable dialogue, unforgettable story.

The Maltese Falcon showed a new kind hero, one with an edge. Bogart, with all the right things to say and seemingly never losing his cool. Then came Casablanca and the ages. The man's \u0096 man comes with a heart. Arguably, three of his best pictures. All showing a change in a man's character and the depths of what acting is supposed to be. Maybe it was Warner Bros all along. Maybe Bogart was simply Bogart.\n\nWhat can I say about this film that hasn't been said in over 60 years since its release. Is it a great film? Yes. Is it a showcase for Bogart? If not, than what else. Was Bogart the coolest guy to ever live? Absolutely. Casablanca is a different kind of love story, more likely to infect rather than effect.\n\nShe almost makes me believe it every time. When she says, \"You're very kind.\" Bergman was more than just beautiful. And with Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt and Peter Lorre, cinema magic was created. But to me, Bogart was the greatest actor of all time. It's hard for me to believe he died almost 50 years ago. Every time I watch his films, it's like they were made yesterday. And that's why he is timeless. I'm still trying to figure him out.\n\n\"I should never have switched from scotch to martinis.\" Is said to be Bogart's last words. A legend, indeed."

        "review_detailed_main": "Although I have so far reviewed over 5700 films, I haven't yet reviewed CASABLANCA--mostly because nothing I can say about the film can add to the many excellent and insightful reviews for this cinematic masterpiece. But, having seen it several times, I guess it's worth at least saying a few words out the film.\n\nAlthough Humphrey Bogart is one of the finest actors ever and he made many, many wonderful films, I think it's not much of a stretch to say this is his best performance and best film. He was perfect for the world-weary and cynical Rick. Sure, African QUEEN, THE CAINE MUTINY and several other of his films were brilliant, but none come close to CASABLANCA because in my opinion CASABLANCA is a perfect film--or about as close to one as you can find. If IMDb were not so heavily weighted in favor of newer films (just look at the top 250), it probably would be at the top of the list. For example, you can't seriously think that THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and THE DARK KNIGHT are better films, though they both are ranked higher on the list. Now this isn't to say these are bad films--heck they are terrific,...just not in the same category as CASABLANCA.\n\nAside from Bogart, the film also is directed perfectly by Michael Curtiz--with excellent pacing, atmosphere and charm. The supporting cast is amazing--one of the best you could find in a film. In addition to the great stock Warner Brothers character actors (such as Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Cuddles Sakall), Conrad Veidt is the perfect scary Nazi, Claude Rains is his usual wonderful self, Ingrid Bergman luminous and Paul Henreid, though a great actor, is somewhat lost among all the immense talent! Amazing music, a top script and all the style and quality that Warner Brothers could muster--this is my pick for top film ever. A fine romance and a fine film about people."

        "review_detailed_main": "In December 1941, American expatriate Rick Blaine owns an upscale nightclub and gambling den in Casablanca. \"Rick's Caf\u00e9 Am\u00e9ricain\" attracts a varied clientele, including Vichy French and German officials, refugees desperate to reach the still-neutral United States, and those who prey on them. Although Rick professes to be neutral in all matters, he ran guns to Ethiopia during its war with Italy and fought on the Loyalist side in the Spanish Civil War.\n\nPetty crook Ugarte boasts to Rick of \"letters of transit\" obtained by murdering two German couriers. The papers allow the bearers to travel freely around German-controlled Europe and to neutral Portugal, and are priceless to the refugees stranded in Casablanca. Ugarte plans to sell them at the club, and asks Rick to hold them. Before he can meet his contact, Ugarte is arrested by the local police under the command of Captain Louis Renault, the unabashedly corrupt Vichy prefect of police. Ugarte dies in custody without revealing that he entrusted the letters to Rick.\n\nNow let's clear up some rumors. Muh has been written about \"Casablanca\" but a few rumors often get repeated. One of them is Ingrid Bergman saying \"The screenplay was not completed when they started shooting\". That is not true. Warner Brothers never put a film into production unless they had a complete screenplay. Now they kept a few things secret from Ingrid Bergman. She did not have a complete screenplay. The director and Warners thought they would get a better performance out of her if she did not know a few things. However it was not uncommon for \"things to change\" while a film was in production. \"Casablanca was no exception!\n\nAnother rumor was that Ronald Reagan was cast to play Ric! He was only \"thought of\" but for only a few seconds. Almost everyone in Hollywood was until Bogart was cast!\n\nRumor #3 The film was an out of control production! This is not true! This was shot in 18 days.\n\nAnother things people don't quit notice is how fast people talk in this film! The film runs 102 minutes. The screenplay is 125+ minutes. The average screenplay is one minute of screen time per written page! If this film was made by today's standards it would run almost 45 minutes longer.\n\nNow if you never seen the film you are lucky. The film is exciting as it is romantic. Not one minute of screen time is squandered. Today's filmmakers would not know how to make a film like this unless \"Batman\" plays Ric!"

During a time of political neutrality, America was entering the war as was Rick, our hard-on-the-edges protagonist. This can be considered an \"enlist\" film to anyone on the fence. Because of it's conviction-driven focus on ideas and philosophy, and how grounded those struggles feel, \"Casablanca\" remains one of the most well regarded classics of all time. The struggles of Rick are applicable to anyone who watches the film, drawing on universal themes like conviction, courage, compassion, and love.\n\nThe character of Rick is a fascinating one on an individual basis. We're set up to a character who's meticulous and thoughtful in the way he does things, paralleled by the chess game he has with no one. At the same time, we know of his loneliness without a partner to play with. We understand the respect he commands with patrons of the saloon yet the deep friendship he experiences with Sam. And while his corrupt inner shell shared with the chief is off-putting like a villain, we know he's \"...at heart, a sentimentalist\" when we learn of his passionate love for Ingrid Bergman's Ilsa.\n\n\"Casablanca\" also features some of cinema's most iconic and beautifully crafted cinematography by the great Arthur Edeson and of course the director, Michael Curtiz's masterful control of capturing the romantic moment. Not only on a story-telling, narrative perspective, \"Casablanca\" is worth studying for it's remarkable technical quality.\n\nWhile the film may be as close to perfect as one can get, some of the third act moments can feel unnatural and forced which could disorient some modern viewers. Nitpicking aside, \"Casablanca\" remains one of cinema's finest pieces of celluloid to date. Anyone looking for another round of film study or a clean dive into old classic films, this would be perfect to start with. It's rich in themes, characters, and intelligence."

        "review_detailed_main": "For the Allies, 1943 was perhaps the grimmest and most desperate year of the war, as the conflict threatened to grind on into stalemate. Back on the home front, movie production was responding appropriately, cutting back on the flag-waving calls-to-arms, and making pictures that were more about hope, endurance, and getting on with life during a state of war. This is where Casablanca fits in.\n\nEverybody knows about Casablanca \u2013 even people who think they don't will probably be tacitly aware of its many quotable lines. Why has the picture become such a cultural monument? The reasons are many, but that quotable script is as good a place to start as any. Casablanca is based on a (then un-produced) play by Murray Bennet and Joan Alison, which provided the outline. However it was given its Hollywood makeover by celebrated screen writing twins Julius and Philip Epstein, whose best picture up to this point had probably been The Strawberry Blonde (1941) with James Cagney; a witty, rather sentimental and very musical period piece. The Epsteins have brought many similar touches to this picture, especially their approach to music and comedy. Many of the key moments have a musical underpinning; not just the recurring love theme \"As Time Goes By\", but the playing of the Marseilles to drown out the Nazis, or the \"Knock on Wood\" number which is played in the first scene at Rick's, and very much establishes the atmosphere of the joint. The Epstein brand of humour doesn't rely on a handful of ridiculous and exaggerated characters, as was the usual at this time. Instead, the jokes all arise from normal things that we might laugh at in real life, such as the market trader reducing the price when he realises Ingrid Bergman is \"a special friend of Rick's\". This sort of thing is crucial for Casablanca, because it allows a little touch of humour without robbing the story of its dignity or credibility.\n\nThen there is the director Michael Curtiz, a man who has not been deified by the magic wand of the auteur theory, and yet one whom any serious film scholar is forced to pay attention to simply because of the number of important pictures he helmed. Despite this being his best-known picture, he is himself better known for the series of swashbucklers he made with Errol Flynn in the mid-to-late 1930s. It is true that Curtiz's style tended to be very technical, and certainly his most noticeable work has been in the action genre, so as such his having directed Casablanca is seen as being coincidental to its success. Still, his shrewd mechanical mind has added a thing or two to this picture. Take that opening shot of the city, panning down from the mosque tower into the busy street. It's a complex, cluttered shot, but it really gives us a feel for the location and that tense atmosphere, with great touches like those two extras bickering in the foreground. A lot of Curtiz pictures begin with a shot like this \u2013 crowd scenes that look completely random and extremely realistic, and yet are full of meaning and rich in detail. Curtiz was also not quite the mean-minded movie-making machine that he is sometimes painted as. He did have a feel for romance and sentiment if it was a picture that relied upon it. Casablanca features quite a few uncomplicated close-ups of characters in emotional intensity, just about the only uncluttered shots you get in a Curtiz movie, and they are incredibly moving.\n\nBut of course, what would these close-ups be if they weren't of great actors? Casablanca has a flawless cast, but also a very bold one at the time. Humphrey Bogart was only just starting to play leading roles, and even then he was generally an anti-hero. However, Casablanca solidified his screen-persona, a tough individualist on the outside, but a good man at heart, albeit one loathe to reveal it. By showing that there was a human side to his charismatic demeanour, he gave his best performance to that point. Bergman too was just on the cusp of stardom, but she pulls off a role of frailty and tearfulness without getting hysterical, as many a lesser actress would have done. And then there is Claude Rains, one of the few long-established players in the picture. Rains is playing his usual type \u2013 perhaps his archetypal role \u2013 and it is actually one not unlike Bogart's, with the crucial difference being that Rains revels in his amorality. And yet Rains's art is that he makes this character, who is utterly despicable on paper, likable on screen.\n\nOn that note, it's tempting to view Bogart and Rains as the two leads \u2013 not Bogart and Bergman. It is Bogart and Rains whose story arcs deal with the main theme of Casablanca \u2013 whether to strive for individual gain or to fight for the good of the people. And this is after all a movie about people, and hope in the unity of people. There is this feeling of people brought together by their desperate situation, which permeates Rick's and the picture in general, and it's something writers, director and cast have all contributed to. It makes us feel that the struggles of every minor player \u2013 Peter Lorre's nervous underground agent, Joy Page's young wife desperate to escape the city, S.Z. Sakall's jovial headwaiter, the sadly-unsung Dooley Wilson \u2013 are as important and immediate as those of the lead players. It is perhaps more than anything else this rich humanity that made the picture connect with wartime audiences, and has made it a work of power and resonance ever since."

Bogart is so ideally cast, the minute you see him on-screen in his white tuxedo jacket is a welcome sight. Bergman is somehow less interesting, and director Michael Curtiz keeps her crying all the time (usually in close-up), which, although appropriately tender and moving, becomes repetitive. The screenplay, reportedly the victim of frequent change on the set, is loosely structured and is often handled indifferently by Curtiz, who nevertheless stages some classic sequences, particularly the finale at the airport. But what does Rick mean by his line, \"I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship\"? Has Ilsa's emotional devotion sworn him off women for good? Beautiful cinematography by Arthur Edeson; Max Steiner's score is used to underline everything, but Herman Hupfeld's \"As Time Goes By\" makes up for the oversell. *** from ****"

I honestly don't care that it's an old film, I personally think that's not a convincing enough excuse for hating a film as wonderful as this , because you are seriously missing out, if you haven't seen it. The cinematography is just fantastic, with clever brooding camera-work. The music by Max Steiner is outstanding, from the sweeping haunting love theme As Time Goes By, to the excerpts of the french national anthem. The scene where everyone starts singing in the caf\u00e9 was extraordinary and one of the many highlights of the film. The screenplay is unquestionably one of the finest in the history of cinema, right up there with Shawshank Redemption and All About Eve, containing great memorable lines such as \"seems as though Destiny is at hand\". The performances were superlative, Humphrey Bogart giving one of cinema's greatest lead performances as the \"cynical sentimentalist\" Rick Blain. Also superb are Ingrid Bergman who positively lights up the screen as Ilsa, the young woman who breaks his heart, Paul Henreid as the fugitive husband, and Claude Rains as Captain Renault. The plot is a little complicated, but I couldn't help being impressed with the performances and the screenplay. Not to mention a timeless love story that I don't think has ever been topped. Overall, a masterpiece, that quite rightly received an academy award for best picture. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

But I think that Casablanca made its biggest impression when it came out, in the heat of WWII, and its reputation has carried it along ever since. I'm certain that very few will agree with me on this, but I think that many occasional movie watchers and many would-be experts like to chatter about this film's \"greatness\", when in fact, it has very little of that. Number one problem for me is Bogart as anyone's love interest --- think about this: his very best performances weren't romantic, or anywhere near it(I give \"African Queen\" a comedy designation). The other problem is the dated silliness (in the so-called comic characters) that I suppose was put in to balance the seriousness of being stranded in Casablanca with Nazis buzzing around everywhere. Then there's that ever-present song...not bad, but very over-used. Since I know I'll stir up a lot of folks, I apologize for criticizing the \"perfect film\", but there are just too many truly great ones out there to get all blubbery about this one. Entertaining for its time period, but not great. But cheer up, Casablanca fans, we'll always have Gaslight, Notorious, Maltese Falcon, and Treasure of the Sierra Madre'."

        "review_detailed_main": "The film \"Casablanca\", which was released back in 1942, is certainly a classic cinematic work that still remains an integral part of American culture. Director Michael Curtis has created a unique atmosphere where the historical context is combined with an intriguing plot. At the center is Rick Blaine, beautifully performed by Humphrey Bogart, who leads a secluded life in the neutral city of Casablanca, located in Morocco during World War II.\n\nActing in the picture is definitely one of the main strengths of this work. Humphrey Bogart perfectly conveys the emotions of his character, capturing his complexity and inner experiences. His laid-back charisma and impeccable playing style create the unique appeal of Rick Blaine. Especially impressive is his interaction with Ilsa Lund, whose image perfectly freezes in the viewer's memory. Thanks to Ingrid Bergman's good acting, Ilse's image turns out to be organic and definitely succeeded for the actress. I still can't understand why this duo didn't take the Oscars for the best male and female roles. Despite my reserved attitude to the picture as a whole, I think that Bogart and Bergman played well and could have become winners. And if the first one received a nomination, then Ingrid was not even awarded such an honor. A pity.\n\nThe picture will certainly pose a lot of questions to the audience about who and how should have behaved in this story. Where and whose place, how to be, torn between feelings and duty, finally, what will happen after the choice is made, first of all, in the soul of the heroes. The film, directed by Curtis, will allow viewers to decide for themselves what is right and what is not.\n\nDespite all the positive aspects, it is worth noting that the picture seemed boring to me. I understand that my expectations played a negative role. I have heard a lot of extremely positive reviews about this film, and when I got to know the picture myself, the film seemed ordinary and not very remarkable. Despite the presence of romantic and dramatic moments, \"Casablanca\" sometimes slows down the pace, which can be explained in the historical context and the nature of the characters. However, this feature can hardly be defined as a disadvantage, since it is part of its unique atmosphere and helps to delve into the specifics of the events and experiences of the characters. But I, probably, as a modern viewer, saw a negative side and a protracted narrative in this.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that the film is a vivid example of classic Hollywood cinema. The acting of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman impresses with its strength and emotional depth. But everything else passed as if in the background. However, it is worth noting that \"Casablanca\" was and remains one of the most important works of cinema and undoubtedly deserves recognition and admiration. Let the film look quite simple and even predictable today, the picture will definitely find its audience. After all, this is a classic.\n\n6 out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you help someone that is in need not only will that person benefit from it, but you will too. Rick fell madly in love with a woman named Ilsa. Ilsa broke Ricks' heart which made Rick change. When Rick arrived at Casablanca, he bought a bar and in almost every scene, he was drinking. The way I saw it was he was trying to drink his sorrows away. Rick mainly cared about himself and he said that he does not stick his neck out for anyone and he would not help anyone out if he would get in trouble for doing so. Rick would also not get close to anyone probably for fear of getting hurt again. Rick did not socialize with others unless it was business. When people in the bar would ask to have a drink with him, they were told no because Rick did not drink with anyone. However, that changed when Ilsa arrived and she asked to have a drink with him, he sat down and had a drink with Ilsa and her husband. When Ilsa came to his bar, Rick started breaking all of his rules. Rick stuck his neck out even when there was a great danger of him getting trouble and he was getting close to Ilsa again. The writing of this story shows that one person can change the way someone thinks, feels, and acts. This is a good example of a love story. Two men were madly in love with a women and one man had to let the women go because he thought it would be the right thing to do. At the end of the movie, the man let her go because he wanted her to be happy, even if it was not with him. If I were to write a love story, I would use this movie as an example because it shows that you can love someone and risk your life for them and they are with someone else. Rick was given a very valuable object at the beginning of the movie and that was some letters. The letters were very valuable and Ilsa wanted them. Ilsa wanted the papers for several reasons. First, they meant freedom from the Nazis and from Casablanca because the letters meant they could get enough money to leave to make it to America. Second, they meant mobility because they were worth enough money for Ilsa and her husband to get on the plane to leave Casablanca. Lastly, the meant a new life in America because they were able to get on the plane to leave. In a way, Rick was like the Nazis. The Nazis were very powerful people and Rick was a powerful man. The French police told Rick that Islas' husband, Lazlo, was not allowed to leave Casablanca and whoever helped him escape would be in a lot of trouble. Rick had power because he had the papers that Ilsa and her husband needed to leave Casablanca. The Nazis sent Lazlo to a concentration camp where he was not able to leave and Rick had the power to make Lazlo not leave Casablanca.\n\nIn the love stories I have seen, there is one person that sacrifices their happiness for the happiness of the person they love. Rick was still in love with Ilsa even though Ilsa was married to Lazlo. Rick could have made Isla and Lazlos' lives miserable by not helping them but, he wanted Ilsa to be happy so Rick helped them. Rick ended up losing his love again and risking everything he had and possibly his life. However, what Rick did for them made them happy."

The ending going against typical Hollywood happy ones, is the only other praise I could give this.\n\nThe 1st half hour or so of Casablanca wasn't bad at all & set up some fairly interesting premises. Likewise the last 15 minutes was an ending that still stands up well today.\n\nBut the period between 30-75 minutes was 3/4 of an hour of chronic boredom. There was no character to connect to or like until the finale & what plot there was, was in no way enjoyable.\n\nGood cinematography, romance & Nazi's together seem to account for the popularity of this, but in reality it was poorly executed & lacked a plot that could hold the viewer's attention.\n\nThere was too much dialogue sometimes & seemed an attempt to cram as many 'cool' lines into the film as possible. Some of them were good & fitted in well, but others, particularly \"here's looking at you kid\" don't hold up well at all, & by the 3rd or 4th time, made you cringe.\n\nA 50 word review of the film makes it seem fairly straightforward. Granted, the main plot was, but I had real trouble understanding the sub-plots & relevance of some of the secondary events & storylines or characters.\n\nThough this wasn't an awful film at all & may go up a mark or two more with another viewing. But like Citizen Kane which I found far worse, it seems another one thats liked because it's been drummed into everyone for 50 years that it's a classic & so we're supposed to like it.\n\nBut then what do I know, I'm just an ordinary bloke.\n\n3/10"

I think he's asking for it there, because I've certainly heard some negative comments in my time, but usually these criticisms come from the sort of people who have a seizure the moment they're forced to watch something in black-and-white. So, we can disregard their opinions then! Every movie lover seems to like Casablanca, and that kind of almost limitless appeal is certainly remarkable.\n\nI consider this movie a triumph in the name of good screenwriting. The directing and production values are certainly fine, for their time, but it's the great LINES that everyone remembers; yet Hollywood still rarely acknowledges the key role that writers play in movie-making, preferring instead to pump up the myth that directors are the sole creative forces that drive production (I'm not denying directors' importance here - merely arguing that it is perhaps exaggerated, as this movie's classic status indicates).\n\nMy favorite thing about Casablanca? Strangely, it's Claude Raines, who is simply so funny and seedy that he sticks in my mind every time I watch it. I love him, but because he's such a sleaze, I feel uncomfortable for it; in many ways, he's the most morally ambiguous part of the movie! Of course, Bogey rules too, and the supporting cast contains two of the greatest character actors...well, ever. Greenstreet and Lorre (or, as I prefer to call them, the Fat Man and the Bug) have more personality than most of today's \"stars\" combined, and they're just two of the many highlights here."

Casablanca is on French soil and Claude Rains (Renault) is the Captain in charge who must co-operate with Nazi Conrad Veidt (Strasser). The two cafes are riddled with black market shenanigans and into this town wanders Resistance leader Paul Henreid (Victor Lazlo) and Ingrid Bergman (Ilsa). In order to make it to freedom, an exit visa is required and this is what Henreid and Bergman are after.\n\nAn entertaining film with a good cast and very amusing dialogue. Bogart rattles off some classic lines but it's Claude Rains whose delivery tops the charts. One moment that I found funny is when a grateful couple approach him and enthusiastically let him know that they will be at his office at 6:00am to collect their visas. \"I'll be there at 10:00\" is his reply. The moral of that is don't be so keen, it gets you nowhere. A good lesson for anyone starting a new job.\n\n\"Here's looking at you\" gets a bit clich\u00e9d but it doesn't matter. I never cared for Humphrey Bogart and his man who stands alone image. It always struck me as cold and unpleasant. However, I'm starting to really like him these days.\n\nOne daft thing about the film is how the Nazis didn't find the visas. The hiding place is pretty obvious if you ask me.

While this film was a bit of a let down it was still somewhat interesting to watch. This film had great acting from both the main and supporting actors who really seemed to give it there all to portray these characters perfectly but that was the only part of this movie that really blew me away. The plot was somewhat interesting but moved a little to slow in my opinion. Overall this film is way over hyped and in my opinion should not be considered on of the best films ever made."

        "review_detailed_main": "Where to begin..? Originally believed a 'B' film in their product, Warner Bros. never conceived the effect the movie would have. Shot in sequence due to a script written daily, the actors never knew what to expect from the characters day after day. The fact that not even the writers knew who would win the girl till the night before the classic scene was shot. And yet 'Casablanca' is listed at No. 2 on the AFI top 100 films of all time (though should, in all actuality, be flip-flopped with 'Citizen Kane' for the top spot). With success in 'High Sierra' and 'The Maltese Falcon' (Thanks in large part to a rather ignorant George Raft) Bogart was well on his way to being a legitimate leading man. This film would make him a legend a studio star and later, a legend. Sure his body of work was the main factor, but 'Casablanca' in hand with 'Falcon' created the mystique of Bogart which films like 'To Have and Have Not' and 'The Big Sleep' only fueled. A mediocre effort from Warners which molded many of their castaway Euro-stars into a great and well written tapestry where everyone stole the scene from everyone else in such fashion it appeared seamless. The film moves along introducing us to each character in perfect detail, the harsh environment of Casablanca, that war-torn sweat-box which could easily double as a Tatooine spaceport from 'Star Wars', and the Nazi imperial rule who smothers them all. Never looked upon as epic and not even filmed as such 'Casablanca' exudes Epic film in a nice tidy package. With all around fantastic effort from everyone on screen with a great turn by Claude Raines the film is a must see and worthy of No. 2 on the list (sandwiched between 'Kane' and 'The Godfather'). Quickly paced and keeping you in your seat, get the popcorn and don't even think of going to the bathroom."

Pro war, pro allies, anti Nazi, even a little anti French, this movie was made smack in the middle of WWII when the outcome was still in doubt and designed get the public behind the war effort. It sure was more fun then those 'Victory gardens, paper drives and gas rationing' and other techniques to get public support. It is impossible for a film made for this purpose to stand the test of time, but Casablanca has, and that's why it is such an incredible film."

Starring Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund, the film weaves a compelling narrative filled with memorable dialogue and unforgettable moments.\n\nBogart's portrayal of Rick, a jaded nightclub owner in Vichy-controlled Casablanca, is both nuanced and magnetic. His chemistry with Bergman's Ilsa, a woman from his past who unexpectedly reappears, is electric and forms the emotional core of the movie. Their reunion sparks a series of events that highlight themes of loyalty, duty, and moral ambiguity.\n\nThe supporting cast, including Claude Rains as the charming yet shrewd Captain Renault, adds depth and color to the story. The film's direction by Michael Curtiz is masterful, creating a rich, atmospheric setting that enhances the narrative's tension and romance.\n\nDespite being released in 1942, \"Casablanca\" remains relevant and poignant, demonstrating the enduring power of well-crafted storytelling and character development. While some might find its pace reflective of its era, \"Casablanca\" is a cinematic treasure that continues to captivate audiences with its timeless appeal."

Ever since I was a kid, I heard of Casablanca as \"one of the best movies ever made\". Sorry, folks. I watched it three times, and the more I watch the less I like it.\n\nThe characters are as empty as sea-shells. Bogart (whom I never found a bit attractive anyway) mumbles through the story, as a one-dimensional \"cynical with a big heart\" (my god, what a novelty!!), Bergman cries a lot, but as a compliant female does what she's told and follows her husband: Rick is a man, he knows what's best for her, and her husband needs her support, he's a war hero!! I would rather be alone, anyway, if I had to choose between dull Laszlo and cowardly Rick!\n\nFortunately Claude Rains can be funny, though utterly unlikely as an officer who at the last moment chooses to \"be good\". Nothing is convincing!\n\nI have nothing against \"classics\", as Parca (another user) said before: I love Lawrence of Arabia, The Night of the Hunter (now THAT is a movie!!), Gone With the Wind... But Casablanca cannot be worshipped as one of the \"best ever\". It's the forties' version of a pop-corn movie. Should you see it if you haven't yet? Yeah, why not? Otherwise, how can you judge?\n\nJust don't think you HAVE TO love it."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie can only be described as GREAT - and it gets even better with the passage of time and the more you see it. The tone of the story, and the presentation of the legendary Bogart persona, and his most famous characterization, Rick, the American ex-patriot owner of the famous Casablanca night club, is completely exemplified in two early scenes. The essence of \"cool\" and \"authoritative,\" Rick is in the private area of his establishment. Sitting alone at a chess board, he nods to his large guardian (in Mideastern attire and fez) at the entry door as to whether persons seeking entry are to be permitted or not. One man, tall and pompous, a key official (perhaps the head) of Deutsche Bank, gets a \"no\" nod from Rick. As he protests, Rick joins the guard at the door, and indicates the man must limit his patronage to the bar. As the man, protesting still, hands Rick his card, Rick rips it and tosses the pieces aside.\n\nThe arrogant big-shot shouts, \"What!? Do you know who I am!?\" Rick,/Bogie replies with his unique look and tone, \"I do; you're lucky the bar's open to you!!\"\n\nNext, Peter Lorre, as the smarmy, little, shady character, Ugarte, sits down at Rick's table. He has the \"Letters of Transit\" which he later gives to Rick for keeping, and which comprise a key element to this story.\n\nBut before this, conversing, he says to Rick, in his quiet nasal voice, \"You despise me, don't you?\" To which Bogie replies, \"Oh, if I gave you any thought, I probably would.\"\n\nIt would be worth watching the entire film if only those two brief exchanges were all there was to enjoy. But they are only a preliminary to a picture and story which have offered everything one could desire, but even more as time passes. The drama, the depiction of the mood of the time and feeling of WW II, and sensational performances from the four principals - Bogart, Bergman, Rains and Henreid - and Lorre, Greenstreet, Wilson, Veidt, and the remainder of the supporting cast, all provide one of the most entertaining couple of hours you can find, regardless of medium or period presented.\n\nRegarding this turbulent time during the maturation of WW II in Europe and northern Africa - as an historical, nostalgic representation of that part of our history, and this film's representation of the best of Hollywood's craft during that era - it provides us more to appreciate today than it did when produced, or when it may have been viewed during years past, and closer to the time period of the story.\n\nIf someone were to place a gun to my head and demand a criticism of any aspect of this film, the only thing I could cite would be the thought that Henreid's Victor character show perhaps a bit more energy and charisma. Henreid was one of Hollywood's most suave, virile, \"continental\" characters, and the man who was already noted for his lighting two cigarettes simultaneously, for Bette Davis and him in \"Now Voyager.\" In \"Casablanca\" we are given to assume that the fate of the free world may hinge on his patriotic, underground leadership, and that the Nazis must fear his abilities more than Eisenhower's or Montgomery's. Granted he would have been low-key in not wanting to stir-up the authorities while seeking to leave - but Paul seemed to \"lower the key\" a bit more than he might have in his performance. However, this is minor, and in no way diminishes this film's greatness."

While this film is definitely iconic and is very culturally significant, I always find it hard to watch because I find it a tad boring. Maybe I'm just not getting the significance of the story. I do think that the cultural significance of the film is one of the most. Since this film came out during World War II, the people viewing it wouldn't necessarily have gotten an escape from their own real life realities. Films are supposed to give a sense of escapism. Even so, this film does have elements of resistance, which could help boost the moral of the people watching the film. I will say that the film had good cinematography. I also like the fact that the film took place in one location, as it felt like that made the story a little easier to follow. Even though I didn't like the film very much, I would still recommend that people watch it so they can form their own opinions on this definitely very iconic film."

One of the problems I have with Casablanca is that it tries to exist on two different plains. It expects us be drawn into the emotional struggle that Rick undergoes throughout the movie. But no matter how hard I tried (and believe me I wanted to love this movie), the film failed on the emotional level. Rick, as played by Humphrey Bogart, seemed horrifically ingenuine. He continually spewed out dialogue which pandered, even insulted, the audience. \"I stick my neck out for no one\", \"Rick never drinks with anyone\", etc., etc. These lines are definitely memorable, but a capable actor could have communicated Rick's veneer of cynicism without words, and trusted the audience's intelligence to figure it out. Indeed, it is this constantly simplistic dialogue, as well as the cardboard performance by Bogart, that continually held me back. I couldn't plunge into the emotional power of the film as I wanted to, and indeed I began to grow annoyed by the film because it seemed as if it didn't believe its own convictions. It seemed as if it would rather be hip than genuine. The film is not without its strong points, definitely: the great performances by Bergman, Rains and Wilson, the surehanded direction of Curtiz, and the memorable song \"As Time Goes By\". But Casablanca failed to draw me in emotionally, and also failed to invoke the feeling of Casablanca at that time. Compared to great films like The Third Man (which invoked the paranoia of Cold War Vienna), Schindler's List (the closing walls of the Holocaust) and Saving Private Ryan (the chaos of war), Casablanca fails miserably in comparison. Whenever I see Casablanca, I am always a little saddened. It could have been a great and profound film. Instead, it is a mediocre escapist entertainment.\n\n**/*****"

        "review_detailed_main": "This film started life as just another Warner pot boiler. No one involved thought of it as even potentially great. The script writing often progressed from day-to-day and the actors were bit players or not well known character actors. Many of the actors were recently arrived war refugees. Bogart was known for his gangster films where most of the time he dies ignominiously. Ingrid Bergman was largely unknown outside of Sweden and her beauty alone makes the picture worth a view. Today, most critics rank this film as the greatest ever made and I've no doubt they're correct. Much of its dialog has become iconic and has beome part of popular culture. The ending is breathtaking in it's simplicity and it is honestly without equal with one possible exception. I've seen this movie so many times that I've memorized the dialog and it always effects me in a way no other film does. Younger audiences complain about the black and white filmography, often overly dramatic 1940s acting style, and lack sex, violence, car crashes, and explosions. This film, thankfully, is guilty of all these points. Look past the typical triteness of modern cinema and see a film that's almost in a class by itself and has come to define a great movie."

        "review_title": "A truly excellent film that lives up to it's billing\u0085 'A Classic'!...",
        "review_detailed_main": "This is a film I've seen many times before but this is the first time I've actually sat down and 'watched' it. I must say I was surprised at just how good it was. Before, there had always been distractions, but today I watched it right through and I must say I was very impressed. It's the kind of film my parents would watch and so it never featured very high on my radar. But when I got into watching films more seriously this was always one of those that had a lot of critical acclaim and so I added it to 'The List'. It finally lands on TV and I had a chance to see it tonight\u0085 Truly excellent! I will explain what I mean by that after this very brief summary.\n\nAt the beginning of World War II many people tried to get out of Europe and one of the preferred routes was via Casablanca to Lisbon and then on to America. Consequently there were many refugees stranded in Casablanca falling prey to corrupt officials and other less savoury characters. Bar owner Rick Blaine wants nothing to do with all this business, in fact he doesn't even like people talking politics in his place. But when certain travel documents fall into his possession he finds it hard to remain neutral. Particularly when an ex-lover, Ilsa Lund, appears on the scene with her husband Victor Laszlo. Throw in a corrupt, but charismatic, French Police official, Captain Louis Renault, a German, Major Heinrich Strasser who is bent on arresting Victor Laszlo and, of course, Rick's piano player, Sam, and you've got the makings of a really great film. I won't say any more or the Spoiler Police (Classics Division) will have me in a concentration camp (again).\n\nYou would have thought a film made in black and white and shot in a 4:3 aspect ratio would be really hard to watch. I'm here to tell you it's one of the easiest films to watch I've seen it quite a while. All the action is concentrated in the middle of the screen; every shot is set up that way. I guess it helps that it is based on a stage play in that respect. Performance wise, well I cannot fault anyone, but I must give special praise to both Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund, both were truly excellent! Honourable mentions must also go to; Paul Henreid as Victor Laszlo, Claude Rains as Captain Louis Renault, Conrad Veidt as Major Heinrich Strasser, Sydney Greenstreet as Signor Ferrari and Peter Lorre as Ugarte.\n\nI'm not usually all the big on love stories but in this case I will make an exception. I think it's the quality of the performances that really makes this work as well as it does. There is a lot of political intrigue in there too. If you remember that at the time it was being made America had not joined the war in Europe and so what it says politically is pretty important too. But getting away from the politics of the thing, I found this film totally engaging all the way through with characters you could believe in and a great script. I said it at the beginning and I'll say it again\u0085 Truly excellent and VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.\n\nMy score: 9.7/10.\n\nIMDb Score: 8.7/10 (based on 204,219 votes at the time of going to press).\n\nRotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 97/100 (based on 59 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 94/100 (based on 319,465 user ratings counted at the time of going to press)."

I was constantly faced with the mention somewhere of this film or quotes from it. In General, it happened. The beginning was delayed immediately and seemed promising, but somehow unexpectedly quickly came the final scene and the film ended. From the point of view of emotional coloring, the movie is very pleasant, there are moments for reflection in the aftertaste. In terms of expectations-Casablanca did not meet my expectations. The biggest disappointment is the lack of epicness, which was suspected thanks to the presence of three Oscars, universal gasps and comparisons with such a masterpiece of cinema as \" gone with the wind.\"\n\nthe film is interesting, with a \"tasty\" game of actors. Dialogues me jobs indeed admired, sake of them can be even indulge, having revised picture still times, but in a whole the film leaves impression virtuoso theatrical setting. Ah there is no in offense scope, of course this not pulling on 3 Oscar, maximum on 1 nomination (what You will anywhere).

People talk so much much about those movies and praise it to such a degree that anyone ho hasn't seen them gets these expectations to see one of the greatest movie of all time. I wouldn't call it one of the greatest, but I will say that it is required viewing for anyone who is interested in cinema.

Sam, the Coupier, the bartender, the waiter, and of course Louie, generate the same electricity, heart, soul, in this one magical blend as we have seen in long running sitcoms like 'Taxi', 'Mash', and especially 'Cheers'.

        "review_detailed_main": "Casablanca is deemed by many to be the biggest picture ever made and one of most famous movies of all time . It's a masterpiece produced in 1942 that was thought as a run-of-the-mill studio production . It was only afterwards which it became clear that it would be a landmark cinema . Humphrey Bogart's forty ninth film , would transform the studio contract player into a superstar and to be the first in a whole string of Warner Brothers's classics in which he would play the leading role . Producer Jack Warner assigned the Rick's role for George Raft , however Hall B. Wallis wanted to Bogart who luckily obtained the important character , but he previously played only mobster roles and afterwards romantic protagonists , besides tough main lead. It's an extremely romantic film converted in cinema history with images (Rick and Ilsa embraced) , moving scenes (final farewell in the airport) and dialogs have been used or imitated in other films, spots and television programmes .\n\nCasablanca is homaged with fascination as in \u00a8One from the heart\u00a8 (by Francis Ford Coppola) or from irony as \u00a8Play it again Sam\u00a8(Herbert Ross). The movie has immortal images with memorable quotes and the best scenes ever written , such as the exciting final when Bogart bids Bergman farewell at the airport with \u00a8Here's looking at you kid\u00a8still has audiences choking back a tear. All film originates unforgotten characters as makes with Wilson, the piano player to whom Ingrid Bergman says : \u00a8play it Sam\u00a8. Bergman is enticing and wonderful , stunningly photographed by Arthur Edeson , she was fortunate to have Orry Kelly an hugely talented designer costume to dress her. His shone as radiantly as Bergman's luminous beauty who never looked lovelier. Along with a fabulous plethora of secondaries such as : Claude Rains , Paul Henreid , Conrad Veidt , Peter Lorre , S.Z.Sakal, Madeleine Lebeau , John Qualen , Dooley Wilson , among others . And a large number of extras , as in the famous scene where the \"Marseillaise\" is sung over the German song \"Watch on the Rhine\", many of them had real tears in their eyes ; they were actual refugees and Jews who had escaped from Nazi persecution in Germany and elsewhere in Europe and were overcome by the emotions the scene brought out . The motion picture with sensitive score by Max Steiner was very well directed by Michael Curtiz . Well worth seeing for everybody and specially to the classic cinema lovers."

Like so many of my most highly rated films, it's all about character. Someone said that modern film audiences don't see it as a classic. I love all kinds of movies. I am disappointed much more with contemporary films than older ones because filmmakers were forced to us a lot more imagination. Granted, there are many bad films in every era as well as great ones. When I see every reviewer start with an evaluation of special effects. Why is it that so many films need to rely on special effects. This movie is a romance of the highest order. It asks so much of its stars. The incredible lighting that accentuates the faces of the characters makes it all work. Then you have real stars in Bogie and Bergmann. Todays actors are so bland and interchangeable for the most part. There was a reason for a star system. Even today, I want to see the less glamorous actors: Hackman, Eastwood, etc. When Bergmann is on the screen, there is no one who can show the passion and pain that she does. Also, consider the vignettes concerning war embattled Casablanca. There is a force at work to destroy all that is good and right. The singing of the French national anthem is antithetical to that scene in Cabaret where the young Nazis sing \"The World Belongs to Me.\" See this if you never have."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am not getting into the \"The greatest picture of all-time\" debate. It's too subjective but if I forced to cast a vote, I would give this the most serious consideration. I mean, what aspect of this film isn't top-notch?\n\nThe dialog is superb, one of the best ever put on film. The acting is great, cinematography first-rate and the story offers an interesting mix of drama, action, romance, music...you name it. This film has everything but color, which might prohibit of a lot of younger folks from ever checking this classic out. That would be a shame because film- making doesn't get much better than \"Casablanca.\"\n\nAll of this doesn't mean it's my favorite film of all-time. It isn't even in my top ten but I always find it very, very enjoyable and the latest 2-disc DVD transfer makes it even better to view.\n\nHumphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, of course, are the stars but I always found Claude Raines' character the best to watch. His witty dialog as the police chief always makes me smile. He has many clever lines and isn't a guy you can figure out. He and Bogart's character are similar, essentially coming across as people who only care about themselves but deep inside are good-hearted people.\n\nThe ending is much discussed and very famous and helps make the movie so revered. There has been so much written about this film that there I won't add more except to make one negative statement but that's about a line in the story and not a reflection on the quality of the film. I wasn't impressed that Bergman, despite being married, was willing to run off with Bogart, claiming she \"doesn't know\" what's right or wrong! Are you serious? Well, judging by the marriage records of Hollywood over the years, maybe they don't know adultery just might be wrong. Anyway, other than that, this is a great movie with many, many classic scenes. Bergman never looked prettier, albeit the aid of soft lens shots on her closeups, and Bogey was never more, well, Bogey, than in here. Add Paul Henreid, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and other fine actors and wow, what a cast!\n\nAn added bonus is hearing \"As Time Goes By\" throughout the film, a haunting song. Actually, there are several songs played, mainly by pianist Dooley Wilson, and they're all fun to hear. As I said, one could go on and on about this movie. 'Nuff said."

        "review_detailed_main": "The purpose of writing this commentary is to solely state that the Writer in no way intends to compare Casablanca to any other movie in the history of motion picture; for the work is not only the pinnacle of Michael Curtiz career but also stands as a magical masterpiece in Twentieth Century Cinema.\n\nI hope I have the criterion to write a justifiable and unbiased review because this Movie is very special to me and I try not to become emotional when writing about this iconic monumental work.\n\nConsidering the fact that there's nothing new to be said about Casablanca, I wonder where to start; probably from Rick's (Humphrey Bogart) philanthropy, Ilsa's (Ingrid Bergman) reciprocation\u2014well reasoned and timely\u2014 her grace and heroism, the Battle of Anthems (German National Anthem vs French National Anthem), friendship, love, sacrifice, gallantry, patriotism, or plethora of amazing supporting actors such as Paul Henreid, Dooley Wilson, Claude Rains etc.\n\nMichael Curtiz surpasses in telling his story masterfully, directing every single actor in brilliant and indelible performance of a life time, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think. The writers and the Director truly outshine themselves with the phenomenal multidisciplinary story of humankind.\n\nThere's so much to grab onto with a remarkable film like this; say the soothing music for example--as time goes by--or the memorable dialogue:\n\nWe'll always have Paris. We lost it until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night. When I said I would never leave you. Here's looking at you kid. Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris? It's not particularly my beloved Paris. Can you imagine us in London? When you get there, ask me! I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met... Was La Belle Aurore. How nice, you remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris. Not an easy day to forget. No. I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue. Play it, Sam. Play \"As Time Goes By.\" Oh, I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it. I'll hum it for you. Da dy da dy da dumb, da dy da dee da dumb... The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like Casablanca to touch the soul. The only other movie I have ever seen that influences me as strongly is The Shawshank Redemption. Both movies leave me feeling influenced for having watched them; they have the power to inspire people and therefore I certainly say both pictures are neatly perfect organism.\n\nBut just suffice to say that in addition to watching Casablanca habitually, I also tend to watch it on the following occasions: When I see or hear cruelty or crises anywhere in this\u2014according to the movie, crazy\u2014world. When I decide to travel to places not being recommended by my family or friends. On the eve of Eid and New Year's Day. Every-time when I am down or empty, or whatever they call it.\n\nFinally, this timeless classic deserved not only three Academy Awards but definitely the remaining five nominations that it lost unjustifiably."

The story of Casablanca is simply straightforward, not witty or twisted ( oh, are all Hollywood films stupid so they call this one witty ??? ). The acting is fine, Ingrid Bergman is great but Humphrey Bogart looks damn boring like a sleepwalker ( or did he try to be cool? ). Ah, the only memorable quote to me in this film is \"The problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world\". The others are forgettable and they may be classic because people consider this one a classic. \"Play it again, Sam\" for instance, what the hell? The line \" You jump I jump remember? \" in the blockbuster Titanic is even much better. The message? Very clear: love, sacrifice, anti-war propaganda. That's all. Not deep or complex at all. The only thing I like about this film is the song \"As time goes by\". It is excellent.\n\nAnyway, Casablanca is not too bad, quite enjoyable. I give it 6/10"

At least Casablanca doesn't go on for several hours.\n\nThe usual plot of old lovers reunited after many years, once again in some Hollywood interpretation of a gratuitous exotic location. Bogart looks depressed, Bergman looks pretty. And that's about all there is to it. No depth of thought or character. Flat, commercial acting from the leads, even flatter and more commercial direction and script. If you like old movies from the 40s, why not watch Citizen Kane? There's considerably more thought and originality there.\n\nAnd I've never understood why people think the lines \"Here's looking at you kid\" or \"Play it again, Sam\" are *so* quotably witty."

Rather than some \"off the cuff\" comments, I'll quote instead from my article on Claude Rains (from March 2000 issue of CLASSIC IMAGES) that pretty well sums up the film: \"It was 1943's 'Casablanca', bustling with melodramatic wartime intrigue, that really put him (Claude Rains) in the forefront as one of the screen's smoothest character actors, almost--but not quite--stealing the film from Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, as the uniformed Captain Louis Renault who investigates the goings-on at Rick's notorious cafe.\n\nNobody associated with the film guessed that it would become a screen classic, least of all its director, Michael Curtiz, the prolific WB director to whom it was just another assignment. It went on to win the Oscar for Best Film of 1943 with an award for Curtiz' taut direction.\n\nOddly enough, the film's memorable airport ending was written and conceived just shortly before filming wrapped up, with neither Bergman nor Bogart knowing whether or not she would leave him for husband Paul Henried. Wartime audiences loved the film. Sydney Greenstreet, Conrad Veidt, Victor Francen and Peter Lorre all gave sterling performances and Rains was again nominated for Best Supporting actor.\" And by the way, I disagree with a former comment indicating the black and white photography of this film was primitive as compared to today's. Incredible nonsense!! As a matter of fact, the film's black and white cinematography was nominated for an Oscar! Ingrid Bergman was at the peak of her radiant beauty in this one--and Bogey was firing on all six cylinders. Great chemistry! As time goes by, we still have 'Casablanca'..."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Of all the gin joints in all the towns, in all the world, she had to walk into mine.\"\n\nIf there was only 1 movie that could be shown to show off \"classic\", old time Hollywood of the 1930's, '40's and early '50s, look no further than Michael Curtiz' 1942 classic CASABLANCA. While well known for the performances of the leads, the multiple quoted lines, Sam singing AS TIME GOES BY and the iconic ending, this film also is a time capsule to a Hollywood of another year - one that just doesn't exist today.\n\nStarring the great Humphrey Bogart in an Academy Award nominated performance (inexplicably, losing to Paul Lukas for WATCH ON THE RHINE), CASABLANCA tells the tale of Rick Blaine the owner/operator of \"Rick's Place\" a bar in Casablanca, Morocco in the early days of WWII. He is world-weary, beaten and cynical and is well known as someone who can get things done (for a price) but also one who will not stick his neck out for anyone. When a couple on the run from the Nazi's (Paul Henreid, Ingrid Bergman) enter's Rick's Place, Blaine (for reasons that are revealed in the film) decides to help.\n\n\"Here's looking at your kid.\"\n\nBogart is marvelous as Blaine, you can see every inch of his world-weariness on his well-worn, craggy face. He is perfectly cast as Rick and his mannerisms and vocal patterns depict a heaviness within. Bogart is often criticized for his lack of acting talent - nothing could be further from the truth here. He is perfectly paired with Bergman as Ilse - a former love of Rick's, who is now the wife of Freedom Fighter Victor Laszlo (Henreid). There is real chemistry between Bogart and Bergman in this film and you can tell that they are former lovers that still has a flame burning inside.\n\n\"We'll always have Paris.\"\n\nBut it's not just the leads who are terrific in this, it's the \"who's who\" of character actors that make up the Supporting Cast that really brings this film to life. From Peter Lorre to Sydney Greenstreet to Conrad Veidt to S.Z. Sakall to Dooley Wilson as Sam (who plays and sings AS TIME GOES BY), all bring interesting faces and characters to Casablanca (and Rick's Place) but the standout is Claude Rains (nominated for Best Supporting Actor - losing, inexplicably, to Charles Coburn in THE MORE THE MERRIER) as Louis, the corrupt Police Captain of Casablanca who becomes an uneasy ally of Rick's. Did I say that Bogart and Bergman had good chemistry? Check out the chemistry between Bogart and Rains, there was talk of a sequel to Casablance featuring these two - I, for one, would love to have seen that buddy flick.\n\nDirector Michael Curtiz won an Oscar for his work - and it is richly deserved. Nary a shot is wasted on this film, each picture a rich black and white portrait. It is interesting to note that this entire film was shot in California (not Casablanca), mostly on the Warner Brothers lot, but Curtiz was able to give the look and (more importantly) the feel of the place through the sets, costumes, lighting and atmosphere.\n\nBut it's the words that these characters got to say that really brought home the feel and atmosphere of the time, so credit needs to go to Screenwriters Julius and Phillip Epstein as well as Howard Koch who won Oscars for their work here. This is a masterful, classic work. One that stands up to this day. If you haven't seen this film in awhile, do yourself a favor and check it out - you'll be glad you did.\n\n\"Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\"\n\nLetter Grade: A+\n\nA rare 10 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

It seems everyone has a line worth repeating, however Bogey has the best ones. But what about the music? It was Max Steiner at his best!\n\nPS Besides \"As Time Goes By\" and \"La Marseillaise\" name at least one other song either played or sung during the movie. No fair going to the video."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we, we lost it until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.\" - Rick Blaine\n\nBefore, I wasn't really a huge fan of the romance genre. I don't know if it has something to do with the predictable storyline that always had a happy ending, dramatic moments that seem way too dramatic, or rehashing the same concept of love; it just wasn't my cup of tea. However, there was one film that made me change my views and to fully appreciate romance films, and that film was none other than Casablanca. It seems to have the same typical tropes that you would find in any other romance, but one thing that it did had that sets it apart from most romance films, and that is pure quality. What it ended up being is a beautiful looking and well-told story that has since became legendary.\n\nSet during World War II, the story centers around Rick Blaine, an American expatriate and former freedom fighter who now runs a successful nightclub and gambling den in the city of Casablanca. His seemingly peaceful life is then interrupted when his former lover Ilsa arrives in town with her husband, a resistance movement leader who's on the run from the Nazis, and asks for Rick's help to escape to Lisbon, so they can flee to America to continue their cause. Rick is reluctant at first, due to his bitter nature and cynical views on the world caused by his and Ilsa's past relationship falling apart, but now must make a choice between his former lover and a chance for hope as the fate of the war hangs in balance.\n\nFor 1942, this was considered a landmark achievement in cinema history. The elegant black and white cinematography gives it a timeless feel, the story moves at a steady pace, and it's all accompanied by a beautiful and heartwarming musical score. Also, so many memorable lines that has become iconic.\n\n\"Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she walks into mine.\"\n\nThe performances are all top notch, namely Claude Rains, Peter Lorre, and Sydney Greenstreet. However, it's the film's two leads, Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, who really shines here. Bogart plays it with charm and has such a hypnotizing screen presence you just can't take your eyes off him. Rick, at first, may seem bitter and wants nothing to do with the world's problems, but you soon start to warm up to him when you know a bit more about him and how he once had a happy and peaceful life with the love of his life until it was taken away from him, leaving him cold and heartbroken. You can feel the same for Bergman's Ilsa; how she seemingly lost her husband, but met Rick and both lived a happy life, only to find out her husband is alive and, in haste, left Rick without explanation. You start to actually care about these two when you find out more about them.\n\nOverall, Casablanca still remains as a high-water mark of the genre that gets better with ever viewing. After over 70 years, this timeless love story still stands the test of time, and I do believe I have a newfound respect for the genre.\n\n\"Here's looking at you kid.\"\n\nFinal Verdict: 10/10 with.... eh screw it, the Epic Seal of Awesomeness."

Whenever I watch it though, I can never really work out why. It's a good film, no doubt, but I can never truly get to grips with why it is so beloved. Whereas, the previous year's Citizen Kane is one whose excellence is very obvious, Casablanca seems more like a very well made yet conventional bit of cinema. Not that this is a bad thing of course.\n\nIt does have a pretty impressive cast though, that is one thing for sure. Humphrey Bogart as the cynical Rick and Ingrid Bergman as the woman, Ilsa, who changes him make for a memorable screen couple; while the support cast is even better, with Claude Rains, Peter Lorre and Conrad Veidt all at the top of their games in this one. The North African setting provides a nice exotic feel, while the World War II backdrop ensures that there is a definite menace underpinning everything. But this film is probably most famous for its romance, with a final few scenes that have become incredibly famous, with lines of dialogue that have been repeated and misquoted ever since.\n\nA good film but I still don't really get the unadulterated love."

It's pass\u00e9, where something like \"Citizen Kane\" still speaks to us.\n\nThe center of this, of course, is Bogart - an old-style Real Man, not unlike John Wayne. His acting is tight and mannered, to reflect what was expected in those days - tight control of emotional expression, control of the situation, no irony whatsoever...All sentiment is quickly dissolved in alcohol.\n\nThat said, what IS worth watching is how Bergman carries emotional content - specifically, within her eyes, which tell all. \"Here's looking at you\", indeed. It's honest, and Bogie feeds off of it.\n\nAnd how the musical 'accompaniment' moves the pieces on the chess board. The famous \"As time goes by\" and \"La Marseillaise\" are the expressions of this force which buffets the actors within the romance, and the actors within the political intrigues. The musical performances are both 'staged for us', as was de rigeur back then, but also is indispensable to the larger narrative.\n\nWorth at least one screening, but do take it with a grain of salt."

Still, I can certainly see why, with the interesting structure and progress from a 40s script, it would be so memorable even with today's standards. And I did enjoy the relayed experience and information of a situation from so long ago. The lightning during the entire movie is probably the single best thing about it, specially for a black and white movie. The pacing is also impressive, which makes it watchable still today.\n\nIt did entertain for the allotted time, but I'll soon forget it, I must admit (probably unwillingly).

It was maudlin and melodramatic; Ingrid Bergman was homely, no matter how many softening effects were used in the close-ups of her face (did a rodent gnaw off the sides of her nose? To say nothing of that masculine jawbone and those underdeveloped lips...); Humphrey Bogart was about as slick and charismatic as the Hunchback of Notre-Dame; and the story was undisguised war propaganda. One would have to have the mental age of 5 to think this movie was in any way great. Watchable, yes, but not great, and certainly not deserving of being on the IMDb top 250.\n\nThe movie was fast-paced, which was both good and bad: good because it would've been unbearable to watch otherwise, and bad because it didn't give the viewer time to get attached to any of the characters (which is just as well, since as I've said, it was war propaganda and so the less effective, the better).\n\nApart from a few good one-liners and patches of clever dialog, the only other positive thing I can say about it is that it was technically well made, in particular the lighting and the dynamic camera work (though I'm not personally a fan of this style of camera work, as I find it detracts from story and atmosphere). It was, however, irritating how the lighting would change whenever there was a close-up on somebody's face. What was the purpose of this? To try to mesmerize the viewer? Talk about corny.\n\nIf you've never seen Casablanca before, don't feel you have to, because you ain't missing much, \"kid.\" It's about as overrated as it gets.\n\n1 out of 10 stars, to offset the deranged \"I'm giving it 10 stars but I wish I could give it more\" reviews this cinematic mediocrity has been getting."

The quality of the acting makes the characters are very believable and enduring. The way Bogart was lit during his close-ups to show the lines of his face, really conveyed his emotional state and Bergman always appeared to be on the verge of tears (no doubt thanks to a special lens or camera effect).\n\nWhile I knew the movie had been released before the end of World War 2, it didn't occur to me that actually meant the movie was in a position to predict the outcome (or to at least postulate a much hoped for conclusion).

        "review_detailed_main": "Roger Ebert once said that his definition of a classic is a film which one cannot bear the thought of never being able to see again. The film he was referring to at that moment in time was \"Casablanca\", the movie that has become so loved and cherished over the past sixty-some years that its affectionately labeled \"everybody's second-favorite movie.\" And isn't it ironic that when the movie was made in 1942, nobody on the set even so much as dreamt that they were making anything special. Certainly they didn't believe their film would go on to become one of the most beloved in cinema history.\n\n\"Casablanca\" is one of those movies that holds up so well because it has appeal to a broad variety of audience members. The movie's basic plot is a love triangle set in French Morocco in World War II. But it's so much more than that. It's a story about patriotism, about the defiance of Nazism, about the struggle of humankind's search for glory and freedom, it's a satirical and witty drama, its packed with characters so fleshed-out and strong that you couldn't forget them if you wanted to forget them\u0085.\n\nI think you get the picture. And this is not a review coming from someone who just wants to jump on the bandwagon and praise what people like to call one of the greatest movies of all time. Because I don't have to pretend. \"Casablanca\" really *is* that good. From start to finish, the whole picture of full of instantly memorable moments, lines of dialogue such as \"Round up the usual suspects!\" and \"Here's looking at you, kid.\" that just lingers in your conscious for the rest of your days.\n\nBut here's the ultimate reason why \"Casablanca\" has succeeded so well. This is one of those pictures that you can watch over and over again and never become tired of. Even after you know the entire story and have the entire movie practically memorized as I have, it's impossible to become sick of. Even after so many decades of existence, the movie has aged tremendously well and it's just as wonderful and enduring as it was when it was first released.\n\nUsually in my reviews I like to describe the power of certain moments of certain films, but I will abstain in this case because I don't want to give away the movie for those who have never had the privilege to see \"Casablanca.\" But I will say this. Roger Ebert's definition of a classic is the quintessential way to describe \"Casablanca\" for it's also for me a film I couldn't bear the idea of never seeing again.\n\n\"Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world\u0085she walks into mine.\" (Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Casablanca is cinematic perfection in every way conceivable. The dialogue, the plot, the acting, and the music are just a few reasons why Casablanca is a masterpiece. Humphrey Bogart plays Rick Blaine, a cynical bar owner who is in love with a beautiful woman named Ilsa, played by Ingrid Bergman, but the relationship is put in a difficult position when a love triangle forms. Rick separates himself from Ilsa, being reminded of the song Ilsa loved: \"As Time goes by\".\n\nI don't know even where to start! This movie has everthing! It has action, comedy, romance, war, and drama, all packed finely into one masterpiece that will not be forgotten! The script is fantastic as one can see because of the innumerable quotable lines in the film. The acting is superb as one can tell through the numerous stars in it, for example Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, and Peter Lorre. With a cast like that, it is almost certain that there will be fine acting. The music, particularly 'As Time Goes By' is phenomenal.\n\nThe movie of course has received critical acclaim. The movie has a 99% Rotten Tomatoes approval rating, and 100% Metascore, all of which I believe are suitable ratings for it. Despite some negativity in the reviews here at IMDb, this is a movie that must be watched at least once in your life. Any film buff, if it has not been seen, must see it. I am one myself, and I thus decided to watch it. It has been one of my favorites ever since. God bless all who read this and bye!"

Even if you are not a fan of black-and-white movies, I can truly say this should be the only one you watch.

Although no imitators of course could hope to come close.\n\nThe acting, the script, the witty dialogue, the music, the atmosphere, all come together into a marvellous blend, albeit with faults - what hasn't got faults? Maybe too much corn and the fast speed at which Rick's patriotism suddenly rears its head, but these are minor considerations. Everything can be forgiven at Rick's.\n\nIt was dated the first time I saw 30 odd years ago, I think it is one of the few films ever made to have passed beyond that state, into a timeless world where all that is shown and all that happens on that screen is utterly believable - like a filmic fairy tale in fact! So many favourite bits it'd be easier listing dull moments: No, I still see Ilsa's tear-rimmed eyes and so submit to the inevitable - it's a beautiful film!"

Although the movie had a bit of a dark view to it (well, it was in black and white) and it seemed a bit confusing at times, it was overall a great movie. I must admit, I did get a bit lost and I felt that the storyline tended to be a bit clear. However, this tale of a war-based romance is gripping and intriguing. The main character, Rick, faces huge life hurdles\u0085including facing and finding his long lost love. It is a universal theme of abandoned love, with a historical twist of World War II. Overall, this wartime romance and adventure is worth the watch."

Brilliant performances by Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Rains. Paul Heinreid does an okay job as Victor Laszlow. Serviceable. Probably the weakest performance in the movie, but he's more of a side character mostly. Humphrey Bogart's character, Rick Blaine, is the true heart and soul of this movie. Torn apart between his cynicism over a lost love of the past, and his inability to guarantee anybody his loyalty, and his staunch neutrality towards all interpersonal matters, are what drive his character arc and growth in the film, and this is what makes \"Casablanca\" top notch as a romantic drama and a character driven plot."

Kudos to Curtiz. The set was nearly perfect and was very convincing. I felt the heat of the Moroccan town as the camera swept through the markets in the streets. I was amazed to hear that this was shot almost entirely in a Hollywood studio. I wouldn't have noticed unless I was told otherwise. The song \"As Time Goes By\" was moving even to a former punk/grunge rocker like myself which says something for its power.\n\nThe topic is very interesting in that it deals with the mystery and intrigue of WWII and the efforts to defeat Nazi tyranny. A beautiful love story was also mixed in with the political refugee plot which held my interest for the entire length of the film. The dialogue was excellent, the best I've seen from the era. This picture was so well written and directed that it would have been great without big name actors and actresses but it was because of the big name cast that it has become the timeless classic that it is.\n\nHumphrey Bogart as \"Rick\" was stellar in his performance. I believed the character to be a heart-broken man embittered and buried in self-pity all hidden under the mask of congeniality. This mask is rudely removed by a bottle of liquor. \"You played it for her you can play it for me!\" is only one memorable and dynamic line from this movie that launched the Bogart cult and mystique.\n\nIngrid Bergman as \"Ilsa\" was adorable. I could easily see why two men would both share a common love for her. I was enamored by her delivery and found myself sympathizing with both Rick and Lazlo for losing or almost losing her. This movie has sparked in me an interest for the work of Ingrid Bergman.\n\nThis was a film I would recommend for anyone who loves the cinema. It has truly lived up to its reputation as a dramatic film for the ages."

There is nothing I could see particularly insightful or original in this movie. It was as bland as a baked potato with no garnishings, not even some salt. Perhaps this is the type of movie that people who don't like to have to think to much, like. The plot is not so bad, it had potential, but seemed to be left to wither in the hands of a weak script and somewhat inept acting. Who is Bogart supposed to be, James Bond with a broken heart? Trying to put this ultra cool James Bond character into the \"real\" world, just doesn't work for me. I never really find Bogart's character believable, so I never really connect with the character. The catch phrase lines, like \"Here's lookin' at you kid.\" are as profound as Schwatzenager's \"I'll be back\". If this was an action type adventure story like Raider's of the Lost ark, I could overlook some of these things. But this movie seems to be first and foremost a love story. And in that sense, I think it fails. I could go on with much more criticism of this movie, but I don't want to beet it to death. It is not an awful movie, more of a very light cute little thing. But one of the greatest movies of all time??? Eeeh Gods, how can that be?!!! Perhaps Hollywood is not so off the mark when they dumb down movies for the general public."

It develops the characters beautifully as the story progresses.\n\nMichael Curtiz's direction is 100 percent. Curtiz knew just how much importance to give each scene, all the while keeping the \"romance\" part of the movie at the forefront.\n\nThe acting is perfect. Although I've heard of many actors being up for the part, I can't think of anyone being better suited for the male lead than Humphrey Bogart. Ingrid Bergman is just beautiful. She doesn't need to do much, because her eyes are so expressive.\n\nThe supporting cast consists of great actors, including Claude Rains.\n\nHere is a movie that didn't have any elements of action or sex or real violence, or any of the benefits of digital effects, yet it shines masterfully.\n\nIt's no wonder that Casablanca has made it on most critic's top ten lists."

We follow American expat Rick Blane through a minefield of political drama and personal deceit as he navigates his way and makes his choices between assisting his former lover and her freedom-fighter husband, and a collaborating, corrupt official and his Nazi superiors. Morals and personal scores are pitted against each other in the dramatic arena of murder and mystery that is Casablanca."

        "review_title": "Curtiz's Magnum Opus",
        "review_detailed_main": "A film that is regarded as a classic from most but does it hold up for me? Definitely. Michael Curtiz is the director of Casablanca, who has done a mountain full of films including The Adventures of Robin Hood and Mildred Pierce. I came into this with high expectations, even in my subsequent viewings, as it has an established cast, a well known composer, a prominent director and an experienced cinematographer. The film is definitely excellent but some elements, due to nitpicking, sinks this film a little.\n\nThe screenplay is developed by the Epstein brothers who had a reputation at their time, and with this project they seem to be in the top of their game. The film's story is packed, exploring a love story, a rebellion and the life of a citizens or immigrants in Casablanca. The film is generally well known for its love story but that wasn't the area that hooked me as I felt it was dragged by it's melodrama. The shifty and uneasy life in this desert city is what kept me hook and it dominates the first half of the film. It is from the start that the film establishes the importance of the city as a character along with the leading actors. The first and start of the second act is dominated with humor as a break from the main storyline which held my interest. I do not hate the love story but I just feel it doesn't hold up with me as compared to the more later love stories in Hollywood, Annie Hall, Vertigo and Beauty and the Beast. Then again, this is a product of its time and I can't frown upon it too much just because of that.\n\nThis is the only film I have seen of Curtiz's work but it isn't the only one I am aware of. He is an underrated director and one of the hardest working. With Casablanca, he just got hold of a fantastic script which got the general public to really notice him. Curtiz wanted this film to move quickly but also giving key moments in exploring the relationship between Bogart and Bergman's characters.\n\nThe year before Casablanca, Arthur Edeson did the cinematography for The Maltese Falcon and in that film, Edeson used shadows well and using lighting to create the mood of the scene. He brings it back here but more. This film is dark, for the most part as most of the intimate scenes took place indoors and at night. Shadow casts on scenes with Bogart and Bergman but at the same time not overshadowing the actors, especially Bergman's beautiful face as her beauty and vulnerability expressed by her face as both are important components of Ilsa. Edeson and Curtiz always have the camera moving, whether it is inside Rick's club or outside in the streets of Casablanca. It keeps the film at a pace that doesn't feel stationary and gives us a sense of exploration of the setting. This pace is also supported by great editing. In intimate moments, Curtiz really wants Edeson to have the camera get close on the actor's faces to not only have us focus on it but to create that sense of intimacy and closeness. Casablanca still has great photography, even in this day and age, and is an important piece in making it an iconic film.\n\nMax Steiner was nominated in 1939 for his iconic work in Gone With The Wind and he was also nominated a few years later for score in Casablanca. His work here in Casablanca is definitely something to be remembered by fan when remembering this film. This should have been an area where it definitely should have won the academy award but sadly it lost to The Song of Bernadette.\n\nFor a film focused on the love story and is this intimate requires actors that bring that chemistry in order to create a memorable performance. Bogart and Bergman definitely work well together but I felt that Bogart is a little too old for Bergman. I would rather have the age of Bergman's character be nearly level with Bogart's and replace her with an older actress, but would the film still be regarded as a classic if the casting choices were different? I think so and I am only nitpicking. Both Bogart and Bergman bring it their all, even if the script is a little melodramatic they make it work for the most part. I definitely enjoyed Bogart's embodiment as this stoic and tortured character who distances himself from letting people in. Bergman has the more overly dramatic lines but she still delivers by showing emotion and care for Bogart's character. As soon as she was introduced in the film and meets Sam (Dooley Wilson), you can see that pain and sorrow rising to the surface. The supporting cast are fine and are either used for plot tools or comedic relief. The actors giving comic relief, especially Claude Reins, had me smiling every time they say something witty.\n\nA film that definitely still holds a strong place in this day and age and is regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. It is a fascinating story of a love story and an interesting take on the life of Casablanca during the second world war. It has its flaws but it's overshadowed by its strengths. Casablanca is definitely worth your time and demands repeated viewings."

At the time it was made, it was put together in a rush by a whole group of different scriptwriters, with most of the people involved in the film seeing it as nothing special. I agree with them! I found it generally trite and predictable. Almost everything about this film is artificial - the setting, the plot and the ending, as is normally the case in wartime propaganda films hastily put-together or not. The person whose fate we are supposed to care about is presented one-dimensionally, whilst the characteristic which defines Bogart for what he is (hard-bitten worldly cynicsym) is the characteristic he will have to lose if the film is to have a schmaltzy ending. What is his real motivation? Why does he do the things he does? There is really no character development at all. Does he believe in ideals and if he does do they have to be other people's? Or is he just chivalrous, or even whimsical or perverse? At a time when the British Empire was close to exhaustion and millions had died in Russia and central Europe, there is a little too much of the lone American saving the conscience of the world about it for comfort. Of course, the makers of the film only ever intended to make a simple propaganda film and they did their job well.They gave the audience the Bogey they wanted and were suitably rewarded with affection from more than one generation of filmgoers. But this is not a serious film, whatever Woody Allen may think."

There aren't enough superlatives in the dictionary to describe just how perfectly the story, the characters, the images, the music, the sounds and all elements of the film's production are presented. The thing that sets Casablanca apart from the other films universally considered as being among the greatest of all time including Citizen Kane(1941) and The Godfather Part I(1972)and Part II(1974), among others, is the comedy of the piece. To balance the heart wrenching and soul shattering effects of war, occupation, fascism, betrayal and lost love with so much high quality comedy and so many great jokes is just stunning. Importantly, the comic elements disarm the audience without distracting from the life and death tension of the surroundings of the film. The emotions of the piece all feel very real and genuine and the audience is allowed into the lives of these characters in a way that very few films allow. Bogart's Rick is just about the coolest guy in the history of the world and Bergman's Ilsa it just about the most beautiful and charming woman in the history of the world. Claude Rains contributes a masterfully enigmatic performance as the police Captain Louis Renault and the entire cast of characters makes the place and the era come bursting to life. Curtiz's use of light and shadows sets the perfect tone for this perfect film and all elements of production are perfectly on point. I can't say for certain that Casablanca is the greatest film that has ever been made as I haven't seen them all but there's a pretty damn good chance that it is."

The results of that choice may be tragic, such as Oedipus' decision to pursue the mystery of his parentage, MacBeth's resolve to assassinate his sovereign, or even when Gene decides to cause Finneas' accident in \"A Separate Peace\". The choice can also be selfless, heroic, even transcendent. Atticus Finch in \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" agrees to defend a black man that prompts ridicule by his white peers. The passengers of the doomed cargo plane in \"The Flight of the Phoenix\" determine not to lay down and die in the desert but rebuild something from the wreckage that could save them. And Rick Blaine, played by Humphrey Bogart in his most memorable role, also makes an heroic choice in the ageless and timeless American film \"Casablanca\".\n\nThe film is set against the potent backdrop of World War II at a small town in Morrocco, Casablanca, and the majority of the action takes place in a restaurant-bar-casino owned by Rick Blaine. Many different personages of differing background cross the threshold into Rick's: French police, German officers, Nazis, and even members of the French Resistance.\n\nRick at first appears to be a selfish loner. He even says that he \"sticks his neck out for nobody\". At yet there are hints, even at the beginning, that there is something inside of him that has concern for others. The film appears to be about how Rick sets the nobler part of himself free from the cynical veneer that he wears. In the first scenes, Rick rarely smiles. He is quick to lose his temper, doesn't expose his emotions, and appears only interested in the profitability of his restaurant-casino. A scene early on exposes the selfless part of Rick briefly, but he brushes it off and quickly re-dons his cynical persona like a worn overcoat. Victor Laszlo also begins to suspect there is more to Rick when he says that he is \"a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart.\"\n\nThe episode that begins to bring that part of Rick back to himself is a former lover, played with magnetic emotionalism by Ingrid Bergman, who enters Rick's place after a long absence, escorting an important leader of the Resistance against the Nazis. I believe this portrayal may be the best romantic performance by an actress in a leading role I have ever seen. While at once feminine and gentle, Bergman is also highly resolved and dedicated to her cause. She is no wall-flower by any stretch. At first Rick appears tormented by her reappearance and a flashback to their love affair in Paris cut short by German occupation affirms the reasons behind Rick's attitude toward her return. (For a movie made during the war in 1942 to adequately depict how the German regime changed peoples' lives is one of several miracles that permeate throughout Casablanca.)\n\nTwists and turns throughout the story do not necessarily foreshadow the final choice that Rick Blaine makes in the end. And we find that Rick was always a hero, and every male in the world aspires to his heroism. This is one of the best reasons why, I think, Casablanca has become not only a classic but a cinematic masterpiece. We all want to make the transcendent choice that may not be best for ourselves, but best for others."

        "review_detailed_main": "The classic second world-war film of love, separation, missed opportunity and uncertainty in a world whose order is collapsing with each day. This has more action than UK's \"Brief Encounter\", but the on-screen tension between the main male and female lead is just as intense (if not more so). They are both stories of people falling in love - who shouldn't fall in love, and as with all great films you have to wait until the final scenes to find out who gets the girl. Casablanca has much more humour than Brief Encounter, but then it was filmed a long, long way from any actual military conflict. An excellent film to watch on a winter's eve on a sofa with your favourite munchies and no visitors."

But nowadays in movies they are all emotionally sensitive men.\n\nI liked this movie, I gave it 7 points because I like old movies.

        "review_title": "visually stunning, a legacy of film",
        "review_detailed_main": "Casablanca\n\nEvery time I watch this film every other film makes so much more sense. Over the years Casablanca has been referenced in more films then I can count, everything from the Muppets and film to the Simpson's and television.\n\nI thought it was interesting that the entire film was shot in studio except the one scene at the start when Major Strasser arrives. This probably has something to do with the director Michael Curtiz who filmed primarily in the studio throughout his carrier, as well this was the common way movies were made in the early times of film. Michael Curtiz, a renowned Hungarian filmmaker, began his carrier in Hungary and Austria making silent films He later immigrated to America in 1926 and began a lavish carrier in Hollywood were he directed over 100 films including; Captain Blood (1935), The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), The Sea Wolf (1941), Mildred Pierce (1945), White Christmas (1954), and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1960) to list a few. He has directed ever genre imaginable and is consistently one of the greatest directors of the 20th century.\n\nThe story Casablanca originated from the play \"everybody comes to Rick's\" by Murray Burnett & Joan Alison. It was later revised by Julius J. Epstein & Philip G. Epstein, who added more elements of comedy to the story. Later Howard Koch began writing for the film in conjunction with the Epstein twins, Koch highlighted the political and melodramatic elements of the story. As well the unaccredited Casey Robinson added some important scenes. I felt that because so many people worked and contributed to the script it formed a balance of genres it mixed comedy, romance, drama, and politics. Each writer wanted to do something different with the script and when they all collaborated together we sort of got the best of what everyone had to offer.\n\nThe director of photography on Casablanca was Arthur Edeson, who is well known as one of the founders of the American Society of Cinematographers. He is known for his work in film such as The Maltese Falcon (1941), Sergeant York (1941), and Frankenstein. Edeson is considered a pioneer of film and was one of the first to film a major wide-screen feature, The Big Trail (1930). Edeson enjoyed experimenting with light and different techniques. The dark film noir and expressionist lighting is evident in several scenes throughout Casablanca, particularly towards the end. When I watch the film the way the whole thing is lit and shot is fantastic the precision to details especially, for example in some shots throughout the film bars of shadows fall across the background and characters faces. This likely indicates their imprisonment, and emotional turmoil. It's details like this that makes Edeson one of the greatest DoP's in the 20th century, and makes Casablanca a masterpiece.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of the film is were the Germans start singing \"Die Wacht Am Rhein\" and the French begin the sing Marseillaise I felt that was the most powerful scene in the film. I thought it was amazing because it combined music and visuals perfectly, as well the French Marseillaise was played by an entire orchestra not just a small band like in Rich's caf\u00e9 the powerful music combined with the great camera work really captures and emphasizes the first time the Germans get defeated by Laszlo possibly foreshadowing the end of the film. Music is always an important part in film you can take a great film but with the wrong music it just doesn't work I felt the score in Casablanca, by max Steiner, fit perfectly.\n\nThe casting for this film was excellent I could not imagine anyone else as the main roles in this film. Humphrey Bogart is perfect for this role; the chemistry between him and the lead actress Ingrid Bergman makes this story come to life. I find that dramas are always tricky to do you can have all the best filmmakers in the world but without good actors you can't have a good drama. Casablanca combined good actors with superb filmmakers to create an everlasting classic.\n\nCasablanca is a part of film-making and that's the truth you can hate the movie or love it, but it will always be one of the greatest films of the 20th century. I would recommend this film to every filmmaker because even if you don't like the story, the film itself is such an important part of film history that it is a necessity to watch. I think this is a great film more for the technical aspects of the film then the actual story, which I find a little dry and uninteresting. Overall I enjoy this film every time I watch it, and I am sure I will watch it again."

It is certainly a classic with the memorable lines and the dramatic ending and the relationship between the characters, plus good 'photography' and shot composition. Certainly, the soundtrack is brilliant, and it probably is among the top films in soundtrack alone.\n\nAs a story and a film overall, my personal opinion is that this film is over-rated. Perhaps in the time it was made, it was among the best films. I think the majority of people would find the film tedious to sit through nowadays. (So, if you're in for a lot of action, you probably will not like the film at all. However, if you're looking for a good story about times past or just want to see what all of the hype is about, I don't think you'll be too disappointed.

        "review_detailed_main": "WARNIG! Don't watch Casablanca because you will regret it, \"Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.\"\n\nThe biggest travesty and atrocity a kid could ever be inflected with, is when you're given the crushing blow that Santa is not real. Well take that dreadful feeling and then multiply it by a thousand, and you might just be able understand the heart wrenching pain that I felt after so many years of eager anticipation to watch supposedly one of the greatest films of all time, only to find out the hard way upon watching Casablanca, that the film doesn't live up to anywhere close to all the hype surrounding it. Trust me finding that Rudolf, the elves and Santa workshop didn't exist was a walk in the park compared to this!\n\n1941 was in the grips of a deadly second world war, but while the rest of Europe was going up in flames, Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) was living it up in the sun, sea and sand of Morocco where he remained entirely neutral whilst cozying it up in a nightclub and gambling den in Casablanca. But trouble is at foot as the Germans come looking for a famous Czech Resistance fugitive leader by the name of Victor Lazio. But then to shovel another tone onto Ricks plate; \"Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.\" The love of his life Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) that once broke his heart returns to cause trouble again.\n\nOkay so what's wrong with it, gosh there is so much to point out, I'm going dizzy just thinking about it. Now I'm sat down, let me make it easier for myself, what's good about it...umm well? I'm stumped, I've literally scratched my head so much, I think I've left myself with a bald patch. The first blatant criticism is the rotten acting that leaves a wretched smell in the air and horrible unsavoury taste in the mouth. Like come on if I wanted to see such wooden performance I would go to a Shakespeare in the park where all the character are played by actual trees! Imagine how many times in the entire film did Rick ever show even a flicker of emotion in the film, the answer is (drum roll please) zero, cero and null. But this ain't an episode of who wants to be a millionaire and I'm not Terry Crews, so don't be expecting any cash prizes. Instead from Rick all you get is one long continuous monotone delivery of each and every line, which unfortunately to my ears sounds similar to a heart monitor flat lining. But don't think for a moment that Ilsa will resuscitate the morbid desolation that becomes of Casablanca at the hands of Rick. Because Ilsa has the habit of always turning smiles upside down, her character has no backbone and merely sways back and forth between both Lazio (Husband) and Rick like she were a hula skirt in the wind anytime she sees fit. In the entire film I'm pretty sure she doesn't have a single thought in the film that doesn't involve either one of the two men.\n\nHowever on a good note, while the acting was crummy, the words coming from their mouths were surprisingly rather good. I've used quite a few quotes from the film in my review because the dialogue in Casablanca was clever, witty and enjoyable to hear and thus quite right the scriptwriter pair of the Epstein brothers and Howard Koch received Oscar recognition for their exploits. Also what I do applaud is the way Michael Curtiz weaves into the film the ethos of always having the courage to resist and triumphing against whatever evil the world may try to put in your way. Anytime you see inside of Rick's bar it is constantly brimming with joy and happiness, which is a refreshing sight to witness when you consider that above all their heads is suffocating Nazi shaped black cloud. The best illustration of this is in the scene where Victor he spurs the customers in Rick's cafe to a deifying yet beautiful rendition of Marseillaise, effectively drowning out the chorus of Nazis singing. But don't confuse my compliments with me softening up to Casablanca, the film still sucks!"

In the meanwhile, the Germans in town are trying to find an escaped hero of their concentration camps, Victor (Paul Henreid). He is the most wanted man in Africa and word has it he's coming to Casablanca. Can Rick be an uncaring spectator forever? This beautiful, classic film has everything, as you have probably heard. It's a fine romance, with grand passion indeed. The story is a heart grabber and the cast is superlative. Made before anyone knew how long Hitler would remain in power, and at a time when he was winning the war, one sees how all of Europe wanted to escape his clutches. If you have never taken the time to watch Casablanca, don't delay. Almost every movie fan agrees that it is a top ten listing every time."

It's interesting. Lots of reviewers hated the fact that the characters smoked so much. Hello, back then everybody did.\n\nSome hated it, because it wasn't shot in color. (haha)\n\nI learned, most of the reviewers don't seem to have any attention span whatsoever. They perceived the movie as too long. (102 minutes btw) Anyways, the film is great, as it basically is about two plots.\n\nThe ill-fated love between Ilsa and Rick. And the refugee subject matter everybody is in. So what has changed after some 60+ years? Try to watch it, if you haven't seen it. Casablanca is a delight. Fresh. Honest. Exciting."

It's been enlightening to finally watch this timeless film and realise how many times it is referenced across cinema. I find the audio in Casablanca very consoling because the hubbub of background noises are muffled, so my attention is solely taken in the soundscape of the current scene. And yes that may sound peculiar, but it makes me very relaxed!\n\nLooking at the other reviews, there is not much more to add besides the wondrous tingling sensation I felt when the caf\u00e9 stands to sing Le Marseillaise to drown out the singing of the German soldiers, and the slightly comic repetition of Signor Ferrari swatting insects at the end of each scene in which he appears.\n\nTo any people of Generation Z put-off by black and white films (or anyone at all for that matter) give up on the Netflix pulp and spend your time watching awe-inspiring films like this!\n\nPS: We'll ALWAYS have Paris."

        "review_detailed_main": "The widespread popular reverence for Casablanca is rooted not in innovation, but rather in perfection. One would be hard-pressed to discern anything particularly radical about the film's primary components. Though captivating in their own way, the story, the characters and the direction are modest and unassuming. Yet it is a modesty tightly wrapped in excellence and precision. Simply put, this is as good as conventional cinematic storytelling ever gets.\n\nDuring the height of World War II, Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is the impervious American owner of a Casablancan nightclub, serving as the epicenter of social unease in what is still unoccupied France. The unexpected arrival of Czechoslovakian resistance organizer Viktor Lazslo (Paul Henreid) and his dazzling wife Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) forces Rick to revisit his painful past and take sides in a war he had previously tried to ignore.\n\nThe alluring, cosmopolitan backdrop of colonial North Africa compliments a remarkable cast of three-dimensional characters, who exhaust and renew their humanity amidst war's cataclysmic turmoil. Negative elements, including the unfortunate absence of native characters, as well as the demeaning treatment of the nightclub's black entertainer (Dooley Wilson, condescendingly referred to as \"the boy\" despite his advanced age), are not strong enough to withstand the overwhelming intensity of a truly exceptional film. Seven stars out of ten."

The 2 lovers parted abruptly and never saw each other again, untill they accidentally meet again in Casablanca during World War II. Will love blossom again?\n\nWanna see a real black and white classic romantic picture? Look no further than \"Casablanca\". I dont usually get easily excited about romantic movies, but \"Casablanca\" is definitely something else and then some! What a powerful alluring romantic story, photographed in a way that is just breathtaking. I mean I just dont know the equal of it. Ingrid Bergman just looks so magnificently innocent and angelic, that I just keep on hitting the pause button almost every other 10 minutes when there is another still shot of her face to be admired. All the characters though are photographed in a way that is just to die for. What a terrific still shots. Heavenly!\n\nBEWARE: All considered, there is not a lot of romance to be seen in this movie to be honest. I am not kiddin. This may sound strange, because I just labeled it as a terrific romantic movie, which it is, but \"Casablanca\" starts out as a suspenseful cat and mouse game, between the german nazi's and a wanted resistance leader during World War II. NO romantic scenes whatsoever at the beginning. The romance part stealthily sneaks into the movie later on and builds up in strength only at the very end. But at the end, oooooh, waves of passion can be enjoyed!\n\nHighly recommended. You got to at least give this classic a try, BUT BEWARE: you must be patient, because \"Casablanca\" starts out quite slow, so dont expect fireworks from the beginning, but it only gets better and more dramatic and romantic near the end. And what a glorious romantic ending it is..."

And of course, Bogart is massive in his screen presence. So, I was quite pleased to lose my 'Casablanca virginity', to put it fittingly!\n\nBut I found it to have problems shaking the fact that it's a filmed stage play, which makes it move a tad too slow for its own good, therefore the dramatic elements feel very controlled, contained and lose vital impact. Best scene I found apart from the classical ones: The old couple rehearsing their newly learned English lines!\n\nDoes anyone else feel the need to review older movies both from a cinematically historical perspective of importance... and then neutrally and separately - for what it's actually worth on it's own? I do- that's why this one can't get more than...:\n\n6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe."

(The principle reason for me bastardizing one of this movie's famous quotes) \"Casablanca\" has, undeniably, withstood the test of time!! This film evokes a romantic humanism into the thick of World War II!!! Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are magnificent as the tormented love interest duo who do not seem to be able to piece everything together, they just know they love each other, and more importantly, something clicks!!! Originally, Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheriden were cast for the roles of Rick and Ilsa, as it turns out, you cannot imagine any two other people besides Humphry Bogart and Ingrid Bergman for the roles!! These two performers exude more of a continental flair!! The American fascination for this flick is thoroughly justified!! Winning the academy award for best picture in 1943, \"Casablanca\" was just one of the many movies in the late 1930's and early 1940's which epitomized an era for excellent movies!! Based on the book \"Everybody Comes To Ricks\", Hal B. Wallis produces this film with a flawless orchestration!! The place, Casablanca, becomes a citadel of despondence and despair for so many people, yet for Rick and Ilsa, (Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman) the situation is tailor made for a passionate redemption!! Max Steiner encompasses a necessary nostalgia with the music in this film. \"As Time Goes By\" (made in 1931) became enormously popular with this movie!! The whole scene is set up whereby Paris becomes a venue for unprecedented and wondrous romanticism!! \"Casablanca\" is, without question, one of the greatest movies ever made!! You must remember this, a movie is just a movie!! Unless!! It is the movie of all time; \"Casablanca\"!! I will see \"Casablanca\" over and over and over again and never be tired of it!! EVERYBODY SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE!! I guarantee you, you will not be disappointed!!! This film has 6 of the top 100 famous quotes in the history of all American film making!! Humphrey Bogart and Marlon Brando may lay claim to the most quotes from this list. Many colloquialisms from \"Casablanca\" have fallen within the realm of popular modern day jargon!! This website ranks \"Casablanca\" 11th best picture out of the top 250. AFI (American Film Institue) ranks \"Casablanca\" the second best American film ever made. I feel this is very impressive!! You will truly marvel at this film, in fact, if you do not think \"Casablanca\" is not one of the greatest films you have ever seen, I will be utterly amazed!!! AN ALL TIME MOVIE CLASSIC!!!!!!"

Listed as \"Warner Brothers Project #410\", this film was supposed to be \"just another film\", but it turned out to be something more.\n\nStarring Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains, CASABLANCA tells the story of refugees trying to flee Nazi controlled France (via Casablanca) in WWII. Amongst the denizens of Casablanca, there is Rick Blain, proprieter of Rick's Cafe American - a place where one can buy documents needed to escape, as well as escape - through a bottle.\n\nHumphrey Bogart is perfectly cast as the jaded, \"I stick my neck out for no one\", Rick. He is cynical, corrupt, selfish...but he also has a heart of gold underneath it all. Bogie plays all of these layers - richly - at once, and was rewarded with an Academy Award nomination. He would lose to Paul Lukas for WATCH ON THE RHINE - a film I haven't seen, so can't judge as to the merits of his win. But...based on Bogart's performance...I'd say he was robbed.\n\nRick's \"partner in crime' is Capt. Louis Renault of the Casablanca police. He is cheerfully and unapologetic-ally played by Claude Rains, who also was nominated (but didn't win) for his performance. These two play off each other brilliantly and the chemistry between these two is evident and I would have LOVED to see another film featuring these two fine performers. I'd say the chemistry between these two actors is a high point in this film, if it weren't for...\n\nIngrid Bergman as Ilse Lund - a past romance of Rick's. When Ilse and her husband, Viktor Laszlo enters Rick's seeking transit papers to flee the Nazi's, the instant spark and chemistry between Bogart and Bergman is palatable. You can feel the heat between the two of them through the screen and the longing and regret for \"what could have been\" is heartbreaking. If you were to show an example of \"screen chemistry\" the scenes between Bogart in Bergman in this film would be \"Exhibit A\".\n\nCredit for all of this - and for keeping the plot machinations moving forward - is Warner Brothers \"contract director\" Michael Curtiz - one of the greatest Directors of \"old Hollywood.\" His credits include the Errol Flynn ROBIN HOOD, James Cagney's Oscar turn as George M. Cohan in YANKEE DOODLE DANDY, CASABLANCA, the Bing Crosby/Danny Kaye WHITE CHRISTMAS and John Wayne in THE COMMANCHERO'S - all big budget, big expectations films that delivered the goods. Curtiz won the Oscar for his work in this film.\n\nAssisting him are the two men who wrote so many memorable lines...twin brothers Julius and Phillip Epstein. They (deservedly) won an Oscar for their screenplay - the only set of Twins to win the Oscar.\n\nThe supporting cast - including Paul Henreid, Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre - are exceptional as well, as are great scene after great scene - including the \"Marseilles\" scene and, of course, the fog covered airport scene at the end.\n\nIf you haven't seen this film in awhile, do yourself a favor and check it out. If you have NEVER seen it, I envy you the experience of seeing this wonderful black and white film for the first time. It is consistently listed as one of the top 5 films of all time - and earns that ranking. It truly is one of the greatest films - with some of the greatest performances - of all time.\n\nCertainly, if you wanted just one example of Studio \"Old Hollywood\" movie making, this would be the one movie to watch.\n\nLetter Grade: A+\n\n10 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

        "review_detailed_main": "For years when I was younger I thought I had seen Casablanca, but it wasn't until I was 17 that I actually SAW the entire thing from start to finish. Before that, I had seen some of the most indelible scenes from the picture (I don't remember them all, but one had Peter Lorre, another was when Bogie is drunk in the bar after the bar is closed and Bergman's Isla goes to him and he tells her off, another was, of course, the last scene). It's when one sees all of the story put together and all of those really terrfic scenes in the club that it really does gell as being a classic. It might not be up there for me with the very great films ever like Citizen Kane or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but there's never a minute, a line, or a performance in Casablanca that turns out to be dull or un-watchable. It's by turns very funny in a few spurts even though it's a romantic drama of the highest Hollywood order. For some on the level of movies dealing with loves lost and found and lost again it's no wonder that this takes the cake. Even the last scene, the lines of which have been parodied God knows how many times now, still has that ring of emotion in the greatest escapist sense. It's a must-see-once kind of movie, even if you find that you don't like the movie.\n\nAnd the cast is probably one of the best reasons to see it. It's really got the best crop of stars and character actors from Warner brothers and beyond. Bogart and Bergman have their spotlight on them here at full blast and they each deliver impeccable performances in roles that aren't too unexpected, but never less than stylish and dramatic. Then there's Peter Lorre, Peter Greenstreet, and of course Claude Raines who probably gives if not his most memorable performance one of his most striking. It's rare that an actor is given such a part that really fits him and still keeps a hold on the viewer so many years later. From the story intrigue and deception and danger involving the Nazis, the heroism and sacrifice that gets involved, and at the core of it- after the club which Bogie owns- is the love triangle that gets resolved in a somber way that makes for a sensational ending. In fact, it's main goal is to be sensational, and for the most part it's truly successful, from its 'a kiss is just a kiss' song to the sweet one-liners."

It has everything a great movie should have: romance, sacrifice, wonderful lines, a memorable song, incredible acting (even in the smallest roles) and it is one of the few non-film noir movies filmed in the B&W era that I wouldn't want to see refilmed in color (that is in definite contrast to \"I Know Where I'm Going!\" which begs to be refilmed to show the beauty of its vistas). But the key that makes everything works is the ending. I don't think the ending that exists in Casablanca could be filmed today and though most have seen this movie (or any of its parodies) I don't want to give anything away. But I encourage you to compare the ending of this movie with the endings of other romantic movies such as \"An Affair to Remember\", \"Sleepless in Seattle\" and even the most recent animated \"Sinbad\" movie. Contrast their endings with Casablanca's ending and you see how Casablanca resonates. Many movies have tried to emulate the ending of Casablanca but it never quite rings true because hollywood movies aren't allowed to have this ending yet the only ones who try are either independent or anti-hollywood."

He spars with Claude Rains (the crooked police captain) and Sidney Greenstreet (a rival bar owner) like a trooper, has a quiet contempt for Paul Henreid (a freedom fighter) and Peter Lorre (a thief), gives Conrad Veidt (the Nazi Major) as good as he gets, is on the level with employees Dooley Wilson and Cuddles Sakall.\n\nThrough all this, truly loves Ingrid Bergman (the beautiful Ilse, the love of his life). It is their story, but not the story you might expect. This is the secret, I think, of 'Casablanca' and its lasting success. From the moment we see the map and the film title to the 'beautiful friendship' line at the end, we're hooked. Every performance is a lasting joy."

        "review_detailed_main": "Once in a while you find yourself stumbling upon a film whose reputation precedes it . It doesn't matter what anyone on this site or out in the wider world says about it . CASABLANCA is a case in point . Anything I or anyone else writers here is entirely superfluous because any insight has already been said and anyone saying anything negative is instantly considered a contrition merely for the sake of it . CASABLANCA is cinematic legend . End of . It should be noted however that despite being broadcast on a relatively regular basis in the 1970s on British television it hasn't appeared very often in recent years . It might be wrong to point out that it was a mainstay in the top ten of the IMDb top 250 but nowadays it's sliding down the list as more people are exposed to it and perhaps think its legendary status isn't as deserved as it could have been . Perhaps I too belong to that camp\n\nThe reputation means so many people have actually forgotten what the film is about . Slightly patriotic flag waver where the forces of democracy get one over on the vile Nazis , slightly romantic pot boiler , and very much redemption plot it's a film that does have a feelgood factor . The story revolves around Rick , an embittered cynic who is only interested in profiting from the war and as events turn out he's about to discover that there's somethings far more important than money . Everything could have been done a little bit better especially when you consider Michael Curtiz is very much a contender for best film director of the 20th Century who made a lot of differing genre films and was always very good at what he did . His problem was that his films weren't marketed for a bitterly cynical audience in the 21st Century and seem a little bit too old fashioned when seen today . That said the up side is you enjoy classic Hollywood with its emphasis on stardom , dialogue and feel good factor there's a lot to admire in CASABLANCA but you have go in to it with the certain knowledge that it's not quite the masterwork its legendary reputation suggests it is\n\nThat is the main problem with Michael Curtiz in general and CASABLANCA in particular . A film like ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES doesn't contain one single scene or line of dialogue that can be classed as realistic in anyway and a film like that which has lines such as \" Okay fellas let's say a prayer for a kid who couldn't run as fast as me \" would see pop corn and drinks thrown at the screen in 2014 . You have to meet these classic Hollywood movies on there own terms and sometimes cynicism gets in the way"

        "review_detailed_main": "Saw this classic in DVD format the other night. I must confess that it looks just as good as I remembered it. Michael Curtiz's film is a curious one. It enjoys presently perhaps more popularity than when it originally made its debut in 1942. As new generations discovered the picture, they made it a timeless film, and generations to come will also be charmed by it.\n\nThe story of Rick and Ilsa and their impossible love affair will be something to be treasured by film lovers forever. Casablanca in the 40s was a hot bed of intrigue; lots of people tried to get there, but perhaps leaving the place was harder because the red tape of that era and the fact that the Nazis had a way to spoil a party.\n\nIn a lot of ways, this is a dated film. By today standards it would be politically incorrect. But ultimately, we all fall under the spell that Michael Curtiz created and for almost two hours we are in Casablanca among the spies and would be travelers eavesdropping into their conversations and the different schemes going on.\n\nHumphrey Bogart was an actor without the looks of some of the handsome male stars of that era, yet, he is mesmerizing as Rick Blaine. It would be hard to imagine another actor playing Rick other that Bogart. Ingrid Bergman was at the height of her career when she made the film. Her chemistry with her co star is one of the best things going, since they made it believable.\n\nThe rest of the cast is flawless. Paul Henreid, as Victor Lazlo, cuts quite a figure and it is hard to think Ilsa would prefer Rick to this suave and sophisticated man. Claude Rains is good as Capt. Renault. Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, S.K. Sakall, and above all Dooley Wilson, as Sam, made a magnificent contribution to the film in small roles.\n\nCasablanca gets better and better, as time goes by."

        "review_detailed_main": "Casablanca is included on the list of the top ten movies that everyone should see in their lifetime. This is a classic movie that is loved by many. The plot and genre is very appealing to many people and I believe that Casablanca is definitely worth seeing.\n\nThe plot of Casablanca is a classic love story and focuses on a women torn between two men. This plot has been demonstrated in many other movies and books, but it is presented especially well in this film. Even for people who do not enjoy a good love story, this movie is still appealing. It takes place in Africa during World War II and can appeal to audiences who enjoy films in this setting. The plot depicts the trouble that people went through to come to America and be free during this time. Overall, Casablanca is attractive to all audiences and is accepted as a classic movie.\n\nTo enhance the excellent plot of the film, director Michael Curtiz used many filming techniques to make the movie more appealing. The cast was carefully chosen and the actors and actresses did a very good job in depicting the characters that they played. While the film is older and there are not many special effects, Casablanca is still appealing to younger audiences today due to the plot, cast, and other techniques.\n\nMany other filming techniques used in Casablanca that help to enhance the movie include the use of sets, scenes, shots, and lighting. All of these characteristics must be present to make a good film and all are apparent in Casablanca. The lighting in the movie is especially well done to enhance the mood of each scene. Without even listening to the dialogue, a movie viewer is able to decide the mood being conveyed through the lighting of the set.\n\nFlashbacks are also an important part of this film. Instead of starting the plot in France when Ilsa and Rick first met, the writers began it when the lovers met a second time in Casablanca. Effective flashbacks were used to show the past and make the movie more interesting. Through the use of fading from one time to another, the film has more excitement and keeps a readers attention.\n\nOverall, Casablanca is an excellent film that should definitely be seen. The movie uses many good techniques to appeal to viewers and is a classic love story and war video."

I also think the camera movements like quick zooms or when the camera moved up to a character, or shots like of the entire club were revolutionary and you can definitely see the influence of the camera work in later films. I feel like this is the film or one of the films in which our cinematic history transitions into the modern period with acting and camera-work the kind that were used to, the film strangely didn't feel old to me it looked and flowed like it could have been made yesterday. The plot itself isn't bad, it's suspenseful and exciting and interesting, Bogart and Bergman are talented actors but Bogart stood out to me the most.

There are enough plot challenges and twists that keep outcomes totally unpredictable. The characters are well developed, act credibly, and there are no outrageous plot twists to rig the outcome.\n\nActing is absolutely first rate by all the main players, with the exception of Paul Henried, whose stiff, mostly reserved personna works in his favor when he leads the legendary and emotional 'anthem competition' scene.\n\nThe dialogue seems just MADE for Bogart's cynical, world weary delivery...and his facial expressions are a delight to behold. Bergman is electrifying. Rains should have won an award as the opportunistic, slick, Prefect. Intrigue is EVERYWHERE in this movie, and the minimalist lighting, the heavy shadows, the bars and bar-shadows make this an example of a wholly developed, carefully presented, craftily written movie worthy of top consideration as THE best Hollywood can offer."

Here's a movie that assumes that the average audience has intelligence. And the tons of laughs were all in the right places for the right reasons. Twenty years later, I can still hear the laughter and applause...and the cheers; especially for that now classic closing line.\n\nIf more black and white classics were given this kind of DVD treatment (the recent 2 disc release), then I'd own more black and white classics. Bogart's brilliant portrayal was ahead of its time and no one else but Bergman could of been Elsa. Same for Rains, Henreid, Sakall, Veidt and EVERYONE else. Perfect cast, perfect acting.\n\nIt's a shame most people will never see this with an audience because this is a crowd pleaser if ever there was one. So the next best thing is the quality and care that was put into the new DVD. Believe it or not, this makes a great \"at home\" date flick. And even have a few friends over...but not the 'chatty' ones. There's just too much to miss if so and so starts to \"yackitty! yackitty! yackitty! during the many (& there are many) priceless and subtle moments. This movie deserves full attention. And the nice thing is...you pick up more the 2nd time seeing it (& 3rd, 4th...etc).\n\nMy favorite line (no way am I repeating it or any others) is Rick's \"poor salesmanship\" rejection. This one film has more great 'one liners' than some hundred movies put together. And it still seems as fresh today as when...well; when I saw it the 1st time.\n\nIt's not that \"they don't make em like this anymore\" applies to 'Casablanca' because most movies, for every year, in every era (since the 1920's); aren't very good. It's always the very few that rise above the heap, every year; especially when you take into account that over 100 movies are made every year. But 'Casablanca' represents a sample of damn fine storytelling for that particular era that time has proved to be...timeless.\n\nA 'must see' for most movie lovers (but not the 'yackitty' ones).\n\n10 out of 10!\n\n(Can't wait for Bogart's \"Treasure of the Sierra Madre\"s 2 disc DVD release next month. Another sample of just how brilliant Bogart's acting is.)"

One of Bogart's most sympathetic characters, in one of the most quoted (and misquoted) movies of all-time. Simply fantastic movie-making from a great era in American cinema. This movie, and Bogart's character of 'Rick' most notably, are reminiscent of other great genres of American cinema of the time, like film noir and the hard-boiled detective story (of which Bogart was a mainstay at the time). Anyone who considers his or herself a fan of love stories, drama, or American cinema (or nostalgia) must see this movie. It is the quintessential 40's American movie."

How complete is Rick's moral degradation? Is there any limit to the depravity of the Vichy regime's representative in Morocco? What happened in Paris between Rick and Ilsa? These questions are all addressed simultaneously as the action unfolds with hypnotic acting by both Bogart and Bergman and brilliantly tight plotting.\n\nSome of the other actors are not quite up to the standard of the leads, but I think this is the way films were made at the time, with broader acting by minor parts than we usually see in films today.\n\nSo much of this film is now cliche, but that's because it defined modern Hollywood cinema and thus had a tremendous impact on Western culture. With some essential cultural artefacts, this ubiquity can make them seem a bit tired or over the top, but Casablanca is so perfectly pitched and moves along at such a wonderful pace that it transcends its own transcendence to be what Hollywood has always aspired to - pure entertainment."

        "review_title": "A Celebrated Wartime Romance Classic with some Serious Flaws",
        "review_detailed_main": "I realize it's swimming against the cinematic tide to avoid gushing over this classic film. After all, its dialog, music and warehouse of awards, including 8 Oscar nominations and 3 wins (Best Picture, Director & Screenplay) single it out as one of the best films of all time. While it is certainly still enjoyable and contains a heart-rending love story, there are some aspects of Casablanca that relegate it to a less lofty pedestal in my opinion.\n\nBefore considering my specific criticisms, bear with me while I go over some historical context. America had avoided entry into World War II in 1939 while Europe was overrun by the Nazi menace. By June 1940, Hitler had occupied Paris. In December 1941, the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and the US declared war on them as well as their German allies. The day after the Japanese attack, production began on Casablanca. It was intended to be a patriotic gesture at its release in 1942. No surprise then that the Academy so enthusiastically handed out its top Oscars to this film. It was the right film at the right time.\n\nThe first third of the movie is the most problematic from my perspective. These are mostly the establishing shots that are intended to give the moviegoer a feel for Casablanca and Rick's Caf\u00e9 Americain. I found the dialog, acting and photography below par in this segment. Presented as a series of brief tableaux, the dialog is stilted and unrealistic, betraying its origins as an unproduced stage play. The photography in this portion and in some other segments (e.g., the Marseillaise vs. Nazi song battle) were clearly posed to capture a \"perfect\" moment. I found it jarring - other films of the era had abandoned this sort of interlude decades earlier. The model airplane used in several scenes instead of a real one was laughably bad.\n\nAfter the introduction, Casablanca picks up steam and moves to a satisfying conclusion. Odd because neither of them really wanted to be in it, the extraordinary onscreen chemistry between Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart is undeniable. So much so that Bogart's wife accused him of having an on set affair with his co-star. There are also many brilliant performances by other classic actors. But the unrequited love story is of course the true heart of the film. If you don't at least mist up in the final scene, you'd better see a cardiologist. Recommended."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a movie so flawed it is in danger of falling apart. Bergman is cold, confused and remote - unconvincing as the woman who dominates the lives of the mysterious and highly respected American Rick Blaine, and the much sought after inspiration of the resistance Victor Laszlo. The Paris sequence is corny and embarrassing producing one of the worse lines in cinema history - \"Was that cannon fire or is my heart pounding?\" Yet this film remains my all time favourite. No matter how many times I see it I'm still moved. I get goosebumps when Laszlo encourages the staff and customers of Rick's to sing La Marseilles in response to the Germans singing. I smile at the jokes. I melt at the supreme sacrifice at the end. I nod knowingly at the references to America's neutral stance in the war. I admire the theme of commitment and sacrifice in a time of stress. And I love the colourful, quickly drawn characters given vivid life by smooth, confident actors such as Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre. Why does it work so well? Is it Bogart in a white suit? Is it the impressionist tour de force opening where every character and every theme is introduced in a fluid journey through Rick's bar? Or is it the totally unpredictable and totally original story-line the conclusion of which could never be guessed, but which feels so right, so heroic, so romantic, so awesome. \"Here's looking at you, kid!\""

I mean before I didn't think I would like it at all, but I know it's revolutionised cinema, and I can now see exactly why. I watched this film in my Film Studies Lecture at Kingston University with about 200 other people. I haven't seen many films that are that old, but I now appreciate that these films were for another generation, and used all the technology available at the time to it's fullest, and if it wouldn't of been for these films, we wouldn't see the sort of films we love today. I thought Humphrey Bogart was extremely good in this film - he came across as a very cool character, and by the end I wanted to emulate his unforgettable lines such as: 'Here's Looking At You Kid', and of course the very final line in the film. This film also teaches many valuable lessons, that all of us can learn from. Finally, I recommend this film to everyone because of the epic values it portrays. Believe all the hype surrounding this absolute masterpiece!"

It also broke social ground, with Sam the pianist (Dooley Wilson) being one of the first black roles to be treated as (almost) an equal. Most of all, it's a film you can watch again and again.

        "review_detailed_main": "Claimed as one of the greatest romances of all time, Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman star in \"Casablanca\", a romance set in Nazi-occupied Africa, about the affection and heartbreak of love. The movie starts with Rick Blaine, portrayed brilliantly by Bogart, who owns a night club called \"Rick's Cafe American\", during December 1941 in the city of Casablanca. Set years after a devastating separation between he and a long-lost loved one, that particular woman, portrayed beautifully by Ingrid Bergman, who shined on screen, returns with a new husband who is on the run for the law, but she also faces serious love connections with a heartbroken Rick. Beautifully directed by Michael Curtiz, and written brilliantly by three or four separate screenwriters, \"Casablanca\" is one of the greatest movies ever made. This movie has more relative humor, strong heart, and memorable characters than the technological success of \"Citizen Kane\". These characters like Rick, Ilsa, Victor, Cpt. Louis, and Sam, are still memorable and lovable to this day. Also, there are so many memorable lines that can be spoken a thousand times, like my two favorites: \"Here's looking at you, kid!\" and \"Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship\", both quoted beautifully by Humphrey Bogart. \"Casablanca\" is a more beautiful and enjoying motion picture, and it is one of the many masterpieces for all cinema lovers. \"Casablanca\", in my review, \"the most beautiful and romantic masterpiece of all time\"."

Was it the director, Michael Curtiz? Was it the black and White photography, was it Dooley Wilson's haunting voice. Was it the superb casting? Who knows? but to think of anyone else playing the roles would have been insanity. Another Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Conrad Veidt, Bogart or Bergman. Impossible.\n\nAbout four years ago I was travelling around south-east Asia and in Phnom Penh (in Cambodia) and one night I went to the Foreign Correspondants club. It was my birthday and I was on my own so I stayed for a few drinks. I then found out that the club was showing THE ORIGINAL Casablanca. The benches the audience sat on were wooden. There were geckos running around the ceiling, no air conditioning, and it was heaven. The visa pronounced vezay, the gloved hand holding the 'aeroplane' Sydney Greenstreet swatting flies. Wonderful."

        "review_detailed_main": "CASABLANCA is a movie about love and virtue, heart and mind.\n\nAs time passes this movie gained the name of one of the biggest Hollywood movies of all time. Overall, I wonder what's so special. Average war drama characteristic of that period on the one hand and the perfection of the relationship of film segments from the other side. When all gather and take away, I find myself thinking that the Casablanca is damn good movie. Heartbreaking, great war drama thanks to its spirit of moderation and memorable roles. Great film about humanity and cynicism in the war-torn North Africa. The average movie, but probably remarkable human story. Here and there, there is a certain lack of logic and a lack of cohesion, but the action is smooth, clear and fast so it's almost impossible to notice. The plot, or the outcome at the end of the film is simply magical. It's risky, sad or politically unacceptable. So many tears and emotion, and yet the end is relaxing happy. I think the film would be even better if he had not had to deal with censorship. Music and cinematography are really impressive.\n\nHumphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine is bitter, cynical American expatriate. Features are there for a reason. Compassion, romance and sentimentality come with a story The focus is on Bogart's character, but that does not diminish the fact that it is a great performance.\n\nIngrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund at its best and the strongest role. She is the mistress and faithful wife at the same time. Her appearance in the film is captivating. Tearful eyes while she accepts the voice of reason and at the same time resisting his heart is impossible to forget.\n\nThe chemistry between the main actors is incredible. Although the stage lights shining Bogart and Bergman, a whole range of supporting characters is simply extraordinary, and among them leading Claude Rains in the role of the charming, corrupt French captain.\n\nCasablanca is a great blend of melodrama, intrigue and humor. The scenario is naturally repaired, but not bad. Uncertainty, acting and dialogue are unforgettable. Personally, the most important that this film in no case can be linked to a particular war propaganda."

I also may have been the only person who was thoroughly happy with the unusual ending that in my eyes wasn't predictable. That's the most I can say without giving it away. It had an array of comical and lovable characters that I couldn't help finding myself wishing that they'd have a happy ending. Especially Sam, the piano player, although he barely said two words throughout the film his charisma and cheerfulness in an otherwise very depressed time made him so lovable as a character. Rick Blaine was a strong character that you couldn't help feeling some sympathy for, but his character displayed selfless and humble qualities that made the movie all the better."

        "review_detailed_main": "'CASABLANCA' - 1942\n\nDirected by Michael Curtiz\n\nStarring Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid\n\nPlot Overview: Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), who owns a nightclub in Casablanca, discovers his old flame Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) is in town with her husband, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). Laszlo is a famed rebel, and with Germans on his tail, Ilsa knows Rick can help them get out of the country.\n\nI know, I know. It's quite frankly atrocious that it has took me so long to see this film. I say that because Casablanca is a masterpiece of epic proportions. I genuinely don't think I could name a flaw with this gem of a movie. It is a masterpiece and well and truly deserves its spot on the Film Hall of Fame. If you haven't seen it, then I highly suggest you do.\n\nSo what do I like about it? The story was fascinating and interesting and intriguing in all senses of the world. And don't even get me started on that ending. That ending, which I of course won't spoil, is easily one of the greatest endings in cinema history. It is a testament to the magic a GOOD writer can make.\n\nHumphrey Bogart was exceptional as Rick Blaine. I absolutely adore this performance and the character is also truly amazing. Words cannot describe the authenticity and skill that Bogart projects onto Blaine. It is a performance that deserves A LOT more recognition by the average movie goer.\n\nIngrid Bergman was, also, excellent as Ilsa. She didn't quite outdo Bogart in her performance but I would be lying if I didn't say she came pretty close. She manages to project so much emotion and trauma onto the audience in such a fascinating and spectacular manner.\n\nAs far as the supporting cast goes, they were also exceptional. Paul Henreid was excellent as Victor Laszlo and added a very interesting and intriguing character to the already riveting narrative. Claude Rains was excellent as Captain Renault and provided an excellent humorous backbone for the movie. He wasn't necessarily essential to the plot but he was essential to the tone and final product. Dooley Wilson was also excellent in his unfortunately short run as Sam. Truly amazing performances from each and every single member of the stellar cast.\n\nFor 1942, this movie is a technical wizard. The cinematography and editing were both incredible. The lighting is visually stunning and worked exceptionally well in the black&white environment. The music and sound effects were also excellent and the visual effects were truly admirable, especially considering the time at which they were created.\n\nAs a whole, 'Casablanca' is a masterpiece of a film and I can HIGHLY recommend it. As for flaws, I can not name a single one. It is a work of art and should be commemorated for its massive contribution to film and the art form. Please, if you have not, see this film; I assure you that it is worth your time. I'll rate 'Casablanca' 10 'Half a Thoughts' out 10!"

What's so refreshing about it, in spite of its classical love triangle theatrics, is that is never places romantic love on a pedestal. It realizes that in a world of uncertainty where neutrality is the biggest crime, there are more noble things than love.\n\nThis movie is sited by many critics and viewers alike as one of the top three greatest films ever made. It's easy to see why. It contains probably the greatest dialogue ever written for the screen. It stars two screen icons in their greatest roles and a superb supporting cast. It's directed by Curtiz with a complete lack of pretension. There's nothing overtly artistic about it, or any sign that anybody involved was trying too hard. Essentially this was a gathering of classy professionals who set out to accomplish one thing: make an entertaining film. In the process, they might have made the greatest. Unlike so many of the other classics of this period, you never have to view it \"in context\" to appreciate and enjoy it. Rock solid entertainment anchored by smart writing cleverly cast and competently directed translates well in any day and age. Play it again, Sam, and it gets even better As Time Goes By."

Not that many, let me tell you\u0085but Casablanca absolutely does! Casablanca has become history itself, a legendary production that'll live on forever. And it should! This film is essential viewing for everyone who ever showed interest in cinema. Every sequence in Casablanca is brilliant, every character is intriguing and every setting is breath taking. Especially when you're watching it for the first time\u0085you'll be surprised how much you actually know about it already. Multiple ideas, lines and sequences were so influential and important to cinema, that they have been used numberless times afterwards. You might even say that cinema would have looked completely different if it wasn't for Casablanca. It's a brilliant love-story with irresistible film-noir and comedy aspects. The entire script - line by line - is pure nostalgic and some of the dialogues originally shown here grew out to become pure historical art. This intelligent movie also depends a lot on its superb cast, of course. Bogart portrays a terrific character here\u0085a performance that yet has to find its equal. His brute and heartless portrayal of Rick is fascinating, especially because you soon find out that he is in fact just a hurt romanticist, heart-broken by a girl who's about to show up again. This girl (the stunning Ingrid Bergman) is practically the most marvelous lady who ever appeared on the big screen. Thanks to her natural charm and beauty, Bergman makes the most out of Ilsa. Film-noir stars Claude Rains and Peter Lorre supply the film with terrific supporting characters and a right amount of humor and parody. It's amazing how this film combines so many different genres successfully. The cruelty and drama of the war and the rise of the 'Third Empire' is mixed with comedy and romance in a unique way. It cannot be denied\u0085Casablanca is pure perfection and everyone should appreciate it. This film isn't to be missed by anyone, whether you're young, middle-aged or retired\u0085this film will move you."

        "review_detailed_main": "Casablanca is a difficult movie to review because there is nothing particularly wrong with it, but also nothing particularly excellent. It is more about whether or not you like its style.\n\nIts style is very misty-eyed. The insisting violin vibrato in the high register tries to cut into your heart, as the main hero talks harshly to the damsel, but inside we all know that in actuality he really loves her. This film can be impersonated by a lady who sighs as she holds her wrist against her forehead in a gesture of fainting.\n\nIs it cheesy though? Well, no, it does not go that far. It stays tasteful and professional, but its style is very clearly defined and may not appeal to all.\n\nThe undertones of the story are about a refugee crisis and anti-Nazi resistance, but the movie is really about the relationship and conversations between the main characters, and to its credit those interactions are good.\n\nHumfrey Boghart is not my favorite actor. He is the poster child of the over-stylised acting that was so persistent in the first part of the 20th century, but this is probably one of his best roles. The most interesting is probably Claude Rains who plays an opportunistic French officer.\n\nIt is competently made but there is nothing that strikes as particularly special about this film. There are worse ways to spend an evening than watching a good quality film, but all the hype that goes as far as perceiving this film as the best ever made is really unnecessary."

        "review_detailed_main": "Overall, \"Casablanca\" went a little overboard on being pro-American, but certain traits make it worthwhile. The plot of course has American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) owning a Cafe Americain in WWII-era Casablanca and meeting ex-lover Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman).\n\nMuch of the film's strength lies in its dialogue. Rick says \"I don't stick my neck out for nobody.\" Alone, this helps the audience understand what kind of a person he is, but the movie also shows his other side. When Ilsa comes to the caf\u00e9, Sam (Dooley Wilson) tells her \"A lot of water been under the bridge.\" This alone is enough to describe not only Rick and Ilsa's life, but also the events that had come to dominate the world during the past few years.\n\nAs for the other characters, Paul Henreid plays Ilsa's husband Victor Laszlo. Even though he has been fighting the Nazis, one wonders how much value he has in life. Capt. Renault (Claude Rains) is amoral but we grow to respect him. Conrad Veidt, Peter Lorre, and Sydney Greenstreet also provide great characters. All in all, \"Casablanca\" remains the embodiment of the phrase: \"They don't make 'em like they used to.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "Who can't help but to like this film? It has a rugged, square-jawed hero, bad guys (not just Nazis, but the French who would betray their own country to the Nazis), a pretty girl (very pretty), exotic locales, and lines that everyone can recite, a la Rocky Horror Picture Show. Lots of fun. However, the fact that this is on the IMDB top 250 is sad. There are at least 250 films better than it (notice I say \"better than\" not \"that I like more,\" nor \"that you like more\"). Degustibus non disputandus est. I will grant that. However, art has tougher criteria than \"I like it, and my opinion counts because I am Me!\" Casablanca is a disjointed muddle of a film. It is cliche ridden, as subtle as a ton of dynamite, and does not come close to true masterpieces of film art. Want to see a good wartime film with good heros and bad villains? See Rome, Open City or La Notte di San Lorenzo.\n\nFor a better, deeper critique of what is wrong with this film, I suggest reading Umberto Eco's essay on it. It is (I think), found in How to Travel with a Salmon or Travels in Hyperreality."

        "review_detailed_main": "In 1942, in World War II, Casablanca is the escape route to America for a few wealthy or influential people and limbo for many others that wait for a chance to raise money and get a visa. The expatriated American and former idealistic rebel Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) owns the Rick's Cafe Americain, the most famous nightclub and casino in the French Morocco's town. Rick is a bitter and cynical man that neither drinks with costumers nor involves with women, and does not stick his neck out for anyone, keeping a neutral political position in times of war. Rick has a good relationship with the corrupt French Chief of Police Captain Renault (Claude Rains), who is bribed to cover the existence of Rick's casino and protect the place. When two German messengers are killed and the valuable letters of transit in their possession are stolen, the Nazi Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt) arrives in Casablanca seeking the document and the Czechoslovakian leader of the European resistance Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). The Germans believe Viktor will try to buy the letters of transit and escape to America. Meanwhile Rick's acquaintance Ugarte (Peter Lorre) asks him to keep the letters of transit for a couple of hours, but is captured and killed by the police and the Germans. Later Victor arrives in the Rick's Cafe with his wife Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), and when she sees the piano player Sam (Dooley Wilson), she asks him to play and sing \"As Time Goes By\". When the upset Rick complains with Sam for playing the forbidden song, he sees Ilsa and recalls their romantic moments in Paris and the wound in his heart when Ilsa does not leave the town with him without any explanation.\n\n\"Casablanca\" is the most beautiful movie of the cinema history ever and the number one of my preference. I do not know how many times I have watched \"Casablanca\", but since the first time I have fallen in love for Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart and they became my favorite actress and actor. Further, I feel myself emotionally affected every time that I see this film, maybe expecting Rick to stay with Ilsa in the end. But Rick's sacrifice for love is certainly one of the reasons that made \"Casablanca\" an unforgettable masterpiece, maybe the most romantic film ever made. The sequence in Rick's Cafe with the French costumers singing La Marseillaise causes goose flesh on me \u0096 imagine in French people! The wonderful romance is disclosed through a magnificent screenplay, with memorable and witty dialogs, perfect development of the characters and the geopolitical situation of Casablanca in 1942 in a dramatic environment of war and a stunning chemistry of the leading couple. The direction of Michael Curtiz is amazing, using closes, shadows and exploring the talent of the cast at their best with the support of an awesome black and white cinematography. The music-theme is among the most well-known in the world. In the end, \"Casablanca\" is the perfect movie, and Rick and Ilsa will live forever together in my heart. My vote is ten.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Casablanca\""

My summer ran out before I could round out the top twenty, but of the handful that I got around to seeing, \"Casablanca\" was my favorite.\n\nI'm currently enrolled in a Gangster Films class, where we screen and discuss classic films in the gangster genre. Having seen films like the original \"Scarface,\" \"The Public Enemy,\" and others, it amazes me that, while these films are great, they feel extremely dated.\n\nThe dialogue is clearly circa 1930, and the sets are all clearly just that, sets.\n\nBut then, you see \"Casablanca.\" While the film is now 60 years old, it still holds up to modern cinema in every way. The characters are believable and sympathetic. Rick's unrequited love is painful (emotionally, not because it's awful, because it's not) to watch, not because Bogart is a great actor (though he is. One of the best), but because it's written in such a way that all of us who have ever pined for \"the one who got away\" know exactly how he feels.\n\nI'll spare you a summary, because by now, you know the story. You know the dialogue, you know the shots. \"Casablanca\" is one of the most important films ever. It is almost perfect.\n\nIt is my sincere hope that the handful of people who gave this film a 1 out of 10 had mistaken 1 as being the highest mark available, because I'd hate to thank that anyone could possibly dislike this film."

Sorry, folks, but anyone can pick more romantic movies-\"Sleepless in Seattle\", \"Random Harvest\", \"To Have and Have Not\", \"The Best Years of Our Lives\", \"Marty\", etc. Heck, there is more chemistry between Hepburn and Bogart in \"The African Queen\" than here.

        "review_detailed_main": "Casablanca is an enduring epic about the indomitability of the human spirit. Beside the obvious charisma and passion of the leading actors, Bogart and Bergman, it is also a glorious tale about the human condition. It is a tale about idealism, and idealism gone stale. It is a tale of greed, fear, resignation, smugness, indifference, and re-birth. In short, this is a monumental film about the vortex of human emotions that make up life as we know it, day in and day out.\n\nBogart and Bergman elude an electricity and a tension that permeates the entire drama. But these brilliant performances are enhanced by the wonderful supporting cast of real, down to earth, \"just plain folks\" character actors of the day. In their stellar performances we see Everyman: the idealists; the hopeful and the hopeless; the greedy, the needy, the brutal sadists, and the tender hearted. It is ourselves we see in the craggy faces which surround Rick and Ilsa. Unfortunately, we no longer see such faces in today's cinema. For it was their genuine \"ordinariness\" which shone so brilliantly from the screen, that grabbed us so tightly and swept us up into the turmoil of the story. It was the plainness of these supporting characters that framed the swirling epic raging round them, so unlike today's performers, who seemed to have stepped out from the pages of Elle and GQ with their polished good looks and vacuous performances.\n\nCasablanca is also an epic tale of the burnt out idealist in all of us who have pulled against the grain, but who, like Rick, have lost once too often. It is the tale of the twentieth-century. It is about a man who has spent all he had to spend, whose spirit which once burned with the fiery idealism of youth, is now but a flicker, only to be re-ignited once again by a lost love. It is an idealism rekindled by memories of joy and heartache, of a love lost and now regained--for a brief moment. For Rick is like all of us, far from perfect. In the deepest recesses of his heart, there is a war raging, one which rocks him to the very depths. The better angels of his long suppressed idealism struggle with his cynicism, his burning desire and his passion to be reunited once more with Ilsa, his first and only love. The good of the many takes precedence over the good of the one. It was that spirit that characterized the times, times long past and long forgotten. But times, nevertheless, whose idealism and generosity of spirit are sorely missing from our world today."

So, if Boogie Nights, Pulp Fiction, Swingers and Usual Suspects round out my top 5, why does Casablanca a B/W, 1942 romance movie take the cake?\n\nI could rant about the acting, script, story, direction and so on and so on. Its been done. Its the magic of the movie that makes it so great, not movie magic in general just the specific magic this movie emits each and every viewing.

I was a little bit confused at times about who was who, what they wanted, where they were from, and where they wanted to go. Casablanca is about a man from America named Rick who owns a very popular nightclub in Casablanca, a town full of people from all over the place trying to get to America but it's not that easy because World War II was going on. The beginning of the movie involves the police rounding up suspects who might have possession of letters of transit because they were stolen after the murder of two German officials. The letters of transit allowed whoever had them to travel freely which would make it easy for whoever had them to get to America. Rick met a girl, Ilsa, while he was in Paris before he came to Casablanca who he really loved and she planned to run away with him but when Rick went to leave she was nowhere to be found. One night Ilsa and her husband showed up at Rick's caf\u00e9. He was shocked, he thought he would never see her again. Rick was tipped of that she was there when the piano player at his caf\u00e9 started to play a song that he told him never to play but Ilsa requested it. Ilsa needs the letters to get to America but Rick didn't give them to her at first. She then held a gun to him and demanded he give her the letters and when she didn't shoot him she admitted that she still loved him and that when they meet in Paris she thought her husband died at a concentration camp. However, she found out he was actually alive and that was why she didn't go with Rick that morning and didn't give him any explanation. At the end, it seemed like Ilsa was going to stay with Rick but when they got to the airport Rick made her get on the plane with her husband even though she wanted to stay with him. He told her she would regret it if she didn't get on the plane so she eventually did but not before an officer got in the way and tried to stop them from boarding the plane. Rick shot him and Ilsa and her husband got on the plane. When the other police arrive, the officer who witnessed the shooting told them to round up the usual suspects in order to protect Rick from getting in trouble for shooting him. The end shows Rick walking away with the man who didn't turn him in and Rick saying the famous line of \"Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\" I didn't hate this movie but it definitely wasn't one of my favorites. The acting was great but I thought it was kind of boring and it didn't really change setting too much, the whole movie pretty much took place in Rick's caf\u00e9."

        "review_detailed_main": "Melodrama. Screen adaptation of the play \"Everybody Comes to Rick\" by playwrights Murray Barnett and Joan Alison. Happy May Day, comrades! It's time to go outside and clean up some of your own home. Is not it? So I think so. And since May has come, this month I traditionally watch military films, and then I decided to get to this cult classic, which occupies the highest lines in the lists of the best paintings, and is not inferior in popularity to the most modern megablockbusters. And although I have already pricked myself several times because of this, nevertheless I cast aside doubts and looked at this picture - and I was not disappointed, in large part. And here's my brief opinion - Throwing the soul of a cynical romantic. Despite the fact that I liked the picture, I will consider both its advantages and disadvantages, which I could not do without. At this point, let me finish with the introduction and get to the point.\n\nSo, the advantages: 1. Scenario - the action of the picture takes place in Casablanca - the port city of French Morocco at the end of 1941, which is ruled by the dictatorial regime of Vichy (after the defeat of France in 1940). Casablanca serves as a transit city between refugees from Europe and the New World, where all these unfortunates are trying to get, using money and power. Of course, there are also cunning businessmen in the city who make fortunes out of these people. Corrupt police. And here the cafe \"At Rick's\" is comfortably located, which is popular with all this public, since its owner does not meddle in politics, and does not attract unnecessary attention to himself, on a short leg with the prefect of police. But the war pushes both opposing sides together in his institution, and then forgotten love lights up with renewed vigor. How should Riku proceed now? Which side to choose? What will his heart decide? What will be the ending? There is drama here, but not much, since the script focuses on the romantic line of the characters, and everything else is just a background for the development of events. The script is simple, but attractive in its simplicity. And although the ending is obvious almost from the very beginning, you are still interested in watching the picture. There were no shoals and logical holes. I am already silent about dialogues and cult phrases. Therefore, to while away the evening is definitely suitable.\n\n2. The romantic line is definitely good. Yes, a reflection on the lost love, yes a love triangle, yes cliches, yes predictability - but the dialogues, \"spark\", and the great acting performance of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman did not let you get bored when watching. Moreover, lovers here are completely different people with their own view of things, who have excellent memories of the past, which even now look good.\n\n3. Atmosphere - the feeling of a blazing Second World War, which in 1942 was still in full swing, is present from the first to the last frame. It is especially bright in Casablanca, where many people and forces clashed, eager to destroy each other. This is especially evident in the example of the police prefect - a corrupt official, a French patriot, who is forced to submit to a German officer who has arrived from Europe, since the prefect - in the service of the Vichy government - is essentially a collaborationist. And not only him, because there are many minor characters, by the way about them.\n\n4. Vivid minor characters - from the Russian bartender (thanks to Leonid Kinski for such a charismatic hero) and ending with dishonest merchants. Frenchmen, policemen, \"slippery\" types, German officers, Italians. All of them are of interest, and the picture perfectly shows their real relationships, ranging from the Germans, who consider Italians weaklings and cowards, and ending with the French, although they lost the war, but did not accept this fact, and therefore are ready to go after General de Gaulle ... Well, and cynics who simply cash in on human grief, without a hint of feelings.\n\n5. Music - of which I can only mention songs performed by Sam, played by the negro Dooley Wilson - who was an actor and singer in his life, and very popular. It is he who is remembered most of all. What about the rest of the music? It will do.\n\nWell, thank you very much for the stage of the performance of La Marseillaise! Sang along in unison!\n\nSo the cons: 1. Globe at the beginning of the picture - more precisely, the western borders of the Soviet Union and Poland. Maybe this is a cant of the picture, or maybe the creators just took this globe from another picture. Unknown. We will consider this an inaccuracy.\n\n2. Cult status - here the picture was just lucky, because it came out just during Operation Torch - the landing of allied forces in North Africa, including in Casablanca (which is partly why it was renamed shortly before the film's release). And after that they were often shown on American TV. Although, judging impartially and objectively - \"Casablanca\" is a good, but a passing picture, which is perfect for a romantic evening, but to call it \"the best picture\" or \"the greatest picture of all times and peoples\" would be very dishonest and even selfish. Just \"Casablanca\" was lucky to get out at the right time and in the right place, that's all!\n\nA little about the main characters: 1. Rick Blaine performed by Humphrey Bogart is a cynical restaurant owner who has to sort out his feelings, decide on a side in a raging war, and decide in love, where can we go without it. Despite the protruding cynicism, both in words and in deeds, at heart he is a romantic, capable of performing a strong and noble deed for the sake of justice. I saw Humphrey before only in the melodrama \"Sabrina\" with Audrey Hepburn, where he perfectly played a similar character, and here he obviously learned to be such a convincing romantic on the screen. Bravo Humphrey!\n\n2. Ilsa Lund performed by Ingrid Bergman - Rick's beloved and the wife of Victor Laszlo, one of the leaders of the Resistance movement, who wants to take advantage of meeting Rick in order to leave Casablanca as soon as possible. Shown as a romantic and purposeful girl who rushes between two men. I liked Ingrid here. Clever girl! You believe her heroine.\n\n3. Victor Laszlo performed by Paul Henrade is an ardent anti-fascist who arrived in Casablanca in order to find a way to get to the New World, because the Nazis are looking for him for his active work, but there is no reason for arrest, because Casablanca is the territory of France, where there are subtleties. An ardent fighter, who piously believes in victory, whom Rick partly admires. Paul perfectly managed to convey the inner world and ideals of his hero, thanks in part to which Germany was eventually defeated four years later.\n\nYou know, despite the fact that seventy-nine years have passed since the picture was released, it is still good, and deserves your attention (just do not over praise it), and worth watching.\n\nAs a result, we have a good melodrama, with a simple and interesting script, bright memorable characters, great atmosphere, pleasant romance and great acting, especially Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman.\n\nMy rating is 7 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!"

I could not connect on an emotional level to any of the characters. I got the feeling the director was trying to create sympathy for Bogart's \"Rick\" but it's hard to feel anything for a self-abusive, chauvinist, murdering, adulturer who never sees the error in his ways.\n\nEvery character except Peter Lorre's \"Ugarte\" is a cliche and overacted. Hollywood could only have gotten away with this in 1942. If anything this silly was produced today, it would be laughed right out of the theatre and onto video in a just a few weeks for being so unbelievable and ridiculous.\n\nAnd what does \"Here's looking at you, kid.\" even mean? It's just another stupid, catch-phrase that has no real meaning.\n\nMaybe this movie's popularity was related to the anti-Nazism of the time. I don't know. I wasn't around then. Whatever it is, I don't get it."

'Its my favorite movie,' he told me, 'watch it or I'll pound you good.' Well, I delayed for a while but I finally got around to watching it and MAN WAS I SURPRISED! This was by far the best movie I had ever seen! Action, humor, romance...this one REALLY has it all. Since the first time I have seen it, it replaced Star Wars as my all time-favorite film!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Anybody that likes movies must know this story. What really makes this film stand out from so many others is the chemistry between Bogart and Bergman. The ending is classic since Ilsa and Rick are separated even though Ilsa wants to be with Rick rather than war hero Victor. Nowadays, the films ending would probably change and even if it didn't a sequel a couple of years later would see them together. The great thing about Casablanca is that we never know what became of these three."

        "review_detailed_main": "Arguably the greatest movie that was ever made..now famous for all the problems on set and casting decisions that couldve been made..until the stars all met. Bogie, Bergman, Paris, War, love, romance, adventure, this movie has it all. When it was made - late 41 early 42 (it was released in late nov 42) - World War two was by no means decided so this film also serves as a morale booster as the seemingly uncaring Bogie for love of a woman finds a conscience and helps win the freedom of a country. The metaphors are present if one looks: Bogie being US Bergman and husband being the allies..and of course the Nazi being the Nazi. Casablanca, translated from french, White House. An absolute masterpiece of a movie. A must see for all. On a scale of one to ten... 10 Best drama i have seen and the second best film (behind only Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Considered one of the greatest films of all-time this well-loved classic deserves to be here. It is the hallmark of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman's careers. It has one of the greatest scripts of all time and it has achieved legendary status over the years. Many consider it purely the best film ever made and in all honesty, I would never try to refute that.\n\nThis film holds such a tremendous presence in movie history it is amazing. Upon seeing the movie it made complete sense what all the hype was about. What more could you want than Bogey, Bergman, Casablanca, and some of the greatest quotes ever said? Do not forget the the French Captain Louis played by Claude Rains or the immortal tune of As Time Goes By. This movie has conflict and the uncertainty of war practically in every scene. We have a rogue gallery of everybody under the sun from Peter Lorre and Sidney Greenstreet to German soldiers. There is a broken romance and a forlorn hero who shows his courage in the end. If you take into consideration when this movie was made, it truly is wonderful to watch. You do not need explosions and violence only great characters and a story with both drama and humor. Up until the final moments of the movie you are captivated the entire time. Then fittingly you are left with the two men walking off into the night with the words, \"Louis I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\""

It's so great and I just love Ingrid Bergman playing Ilsa Lund. Her appearance and her lines. My favorite line of her: \"You know how much I loved you, how much I still love you\" But in general I think this movie just rocks the cinema. I have seen it once on the big screen and it was so different from watching it on TV. I bought that film in two versions (english+german) and I'm planning on buying it in italian, too. I can only say that it's the best movie I've ever seen and that it's my favorite one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Bergman's the best!"

'Casablanca (1942)' is a cynical but well-drawn piece with a gruff lead who's callously charismatic and charming in that straight-talking kind of way. It manages to make you care for quite a small story while highlighting that, no matter how insignificant it may actually be in the grand scheme of things, it means the world to the characters caught in the middle of it. 7/10"
