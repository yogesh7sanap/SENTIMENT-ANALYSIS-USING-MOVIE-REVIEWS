The Dude is given the chance to seek out those men.\n\nWhat a hilarious movie this is, from start to finish it's sheer brilliance, it doesn't matter how many times I watch it, I never tire of it, talk about a film you can watch over and over.\n\nIt's genuinely funny, and with plenty of mixed humour, some of it's smart, some of its slapstick, some of it's a little surreal, overall, it just works. I'm not sure the story is anything new or complex, but that idea of two people with the same unusual name being linked by a crime, it works.\n\nThe scene with Larry and the car is probably my favourite from the whole movie, talk about hilarious, that poor car.\n\nJeff Bridges has put in some marvellous performances over the years, for me though, this is the best, he just nails it, he's hilarious.\n\nJohn Goodman is great, he steals many of the scenes, Julianne Moore is terrific, not sure if I prefer the accent or hairstyle, she's so good.\n\nPerfect music throughout, seeing this you'll want to download The Gypsy Kings. You'll want to sip a White Russian at the same time.\n\nA Joy!!\n\n9/10."

The main characters are Jeff Bridges (who plays such broad roles like The Muse, The Contender, and Sea Biscuit), John Goodman (who should have won an oscar for best supporting actor for his character, Walter Sobchak)Juliane Moore (Maude Lebowski)and Steve Buscemi (who is unique in every Coen Brother movie).\n\nThe first time I saw this movie, I will admit that I enjoyed it, but did not fully appreciate its level of humor and raw talent. I thought the middle section was a bit too depressing and long. But trust me, this is a movie that gets more funny every time you see it, even if it's your thousandth time seeing it. Its level of comedy, action, brutality, and vulgarity become that much more evident and important.\n\nThe characters are brilliantly written by the coen brothers, and, likewise, are brilliantly portrayed by the actors. The Big Lebowski is like no other film. It will make you laugh and it will make you cry. There is no other film such as TBL that is sharp and witty all the way through. One of the Joel and Ethan Coen's best, and one of the movie industry's best comedic film of all time. You want to go see this flick."

You feel it in the sing-songy banalities of Fargo, and in the noiresque machine-gun dialogue of Miller's Crossing, but neither of these can prepare you for the feast for the ears that is The Big Lebowski.\n\nChanneling the opaque mysteries of Raymond Chandler, the Coens throw LA resident bum and Bowling aficionado Jeff Lebowski (\"The Dude\" to his friends) into a strange triple-crossing case of kidnapping, ransoms, nihilists and urinated-upon rugs. It is the equivalent of throwing unrelenting forces at an immovable object, the Dude's bemused stoicism at constant odds with the world around him. He'd much rather be bowling with crazed Vietnam Vet Walter (John Goodman) and pure silent soul Donnie (Steve Buscemi).\n\nAs with so much of the Coens' output, style is more than half the point: not just visual, though ace DP Roger Deakins paints an alluring canvas, but tonal and auditory. This is an insanely funny head-trip of a movie, with wonderfully idiosyncratic characters, down to the smallest part. Who better than the Coens to reinvent the comedy of errors?\n\nThis is without a doubt one of their very best, a personal favorite, an unmissable film and the kind of experience that will plant an indelible smile on your face. Do yourself and see this now, if you haven't already."

I do admit that this is a film that I had to see six times to get. Every time I watch it I learn something new. The genius of the film lies within a game I think the Coen brothers play with their audiences. There are the touches of the masters in many of their films. In \"The Hudsucker Proxy,\" it was Preston Sturges and Frank Capra. In \"Raising Arizona,\" I felt a touch of Sam Fuller. In this film, I felt many touches of greatness, but more specifically I felt John Sayles or even John Cassevettes in spots. The camera was manipulated beautifully and I felt a tinge of their talents lurking in at many a turn. The performances are astounding, especially Goodman as the deranged bowler still living deep within the jungles of the Vietcong. Huddleston is also quite wonderful as the title character. Turturro gives a fine cameo as \"Jesus,\" coupled with a rousing and humurous version of the Eagles, \"Hotel California,\" done in Espanol. I hope this is a film that is looked at with more seriousness. It is, once you dig deep, a fine piece of filmmaking."

Throughout their irreverent career, they have explored different subjects and themes. Their best stories evolve from kidnapping schemes in films like \"Raising Arizona \" and \"Fargo\", one of my very favorites. I thought that film was fervently free. I was so ever wrong. It's as if the Coen Brothers have celebrated their complete breakthrough success (Academy Award winners), and now are willing to do whatever they please. \"The Big Lebowski\" is a film so meandering, so wonderfully novel, that I found myself missing the many other sporadic jokes as I was heaving from laughter. The film is basically about mistaken identity, eccentric characters, and a soiled rug. This film extols the bowler, the allies, even the pins. We experience an actual bowling ball POV, as the Dude (Jeff Bridges) hallucinates. This film has nihilists, feminists, millionares, paedophiles, drugged out hippies, underachieving students, incompetent criminals, pornographers and 'Nam veterans. This movie is open to anything , anything... Some people are turned off by absurd looniness, because it's so grandiosely different. Yet who couldn't chuckle, if not explode, when a bowler dressed in a tight purple suit licks a bowling ball's finger hole, and the camera pans down to reveal his name as Jesus! I will disclose no more, but urgently recommend you to traverse to your nearest video abode and rent this true escapists' feature. Abandon all solemn inhibitons, though! One can not keep a straight face whilst watching."

The Dude's unstable friend Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) convinces him to go see the rich Lebowski for compensation for the rug. Later Bunny is kidnapped for a $1M ransom. Rich Lebowski asks the Dude to do the ransom hand off. Walter tries to double cross the kidnappers but the drop off goes terribly wrong. The money is stolen. All the while, the Dude and Walter is in a bowling tournament with Donny Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi). Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore) is Lebowski's daughter who wants the Dude to recover the money from the kidnappers.\n\nThis is crazy Coen movie. This is a weird black comedy. It reminds me of the craziest parts of 'Raising Arizona'. It's a little too meandering with weird characters coming in every few minutes. This is much more weird than funny. I found only a few big laughs like the fking toe. On the other hand, it is completely unique. A lot of it is weird for weird's sake. It's a lot of weird.

My friend was flabbergasted, as she couldn't identify any phrases, humorous scenes, or references that she had ever heard or seen her daughter's group use.

        "review_detailed_main": "I tried watching this film on TV a few years ago, but I made the mistake of doing so with my kids nearby. In the first 10 minutes of so, I heard 'f#@$' (a word you are NOT allowed to use even once on IMDb) dozens of times. Realizing that the film was NOT family-friendly, I turned it off despite all the very positive reviews I'd read for it. However, considering I've seen all the Coen Brothers films except this one, I knew that eventually I'd get back to seeing it. Nearly a decade has passed, and I finally got around to seeing this cult favorite.\n\nConsidering that there are nearing 1000 reviews for this film, I won't bother discussing the plot--it's been explained to death. Besides, the plot, believe it or not, is not all that important. As a mystery film, the mystery is figured out early in the film. So, despite this, why is the film so good--good enough that I gave it a 9 and many consider it their favorite film ever? Well, the Coen Brothers' bizarre and surreal style really make this film and off the top of my head I can only think of two of their films I liked better, THE HUDSUCKER PROXY (their most underrated film) and OH BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? (their film that gets better with each viewing). This is very good company, as these two other films are absolutely brilliant--and I consider THE BIG LEBOWSKI to be much more interesting that the much ballyhooed FARGO (which, inexplicably, won two Oscars--despite not being among the brothers' best films because it's way too normal--sort of like a Coen Brothers film for those who don't get the more bizarre Coen Brothers films).\n\nWhat, in particular, did I like? Well, the characters were THE best part of the film--as only the Coens can create such quirky and unique characters. Simply put, there is no one like Lebowski in any of the thousands and thousands of films I'd seen before--and uniqueness is something I value most in a film. The alcoholic, lazy and hopelessly pathetic guy is like no hero you'll ever see in a film! The usual quirky characters are here as well--in spades! What I also loved were the little movies within the movie. When Lebowski got knocked out, you got to see his bizarre dreams that were more like films than dreams--particularly the one later in the film that just killed me it was so funny and stylish. Believe it or not, the dream is a phallic-filled song and dance film...directed by a famous porno director (though without actual nudity). It just has to be seen to be believed and only HUDSUCKER PROXY had stranger and more entertaining interludes. In fact, I found myself laughing out loud at this great scene...and a few more.\n\nOverall, a highly imaginative and wonderfully quirky film with very little plot and gobs of cursing. NOT family-friendly or a film to show your mother (unless you DO want to give her a heart attack), but still well worth seeing. Oh, and by the way, the version often shown on TV recently is an edited version with many of the expletives removed. The original actors provided alternative words for the f-bomb and it's done reasonably seamlessly. Frankly, I don't think it hurts the film and you still get to hear words like penis which have not been changed."

Totally. Jeff Bridges is miraculous. His character is unique, never seen and at the same times is all of Bridges characters put together. I love him in this part and I love the Coen brothers for writing it knowing, I'm sure, that Bridges was going to give it that real, totally real surreal kind of life. Philip Seymour Hoffman, comes in to do what he does best, being memorable and then, of course, John Tarturro, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, delicious, each one of them - I'm pretty sure The Big Lebowski will be around for centuries and it will always have something to say even if we don't know exactly what."

Bridges' character is the laid back, sixties protest type who is accosted one day (a case of mistaken identity) as a couple of thugs beat him and one pees on his rug. This sets in motion and effort to find the man who shares his name and get his rug replaced (he ultimately steals one of the man's rugs). This sets off John Goodman (a poster child for anger management). They become involved in a kidnapping drop and I can't begin to explain the rest. Suffice it to say, these guys have a great chemistry and all Bridges can do is watch the dominoes fall. Goodman has made a career of playing lovable psychos for the Coen Brothers. This may be his masterpiece."

        "review_detailed_main": "Recently given a one night cinematic return to mark 20 years since its initial release. \"The Big Lebowski\" remains on the highpoints of the Coen Brothers remarkable career of excellence.\n\nTheir farcical homage to Raymond Chandler stars Jeff Bridges, as \"The Dude\" whose real name, Jeff Lebowski drags him into a plot to ransom the wife of his namesake, played by David Huddleston. Blackmailers come to the wrong address, rugs are pissed on and threats are made. Eventually the \"Big\" Lebowski chooses \"The Dude\" to be the bag man for the ransom drop off. A decision that all involved soon come to regret.\n\nTwenty years has allowed me to watch \"The Big Lebowski\" a few times, and to be fair it's a film that improves with each watch. The plot is nothing special, in fact it's almost non-existant. The character revolve around each other and at the end of it you're no wiser as to who, if anyone, actually kidnapped Bunny (Tara Reid) or what happened to the $1M dollars. . But you come to appreciate that the plot isn't as important as the characters and what characters they are. Jeff Bridges gives a career best performance as \"The Dude\".... Mumbling and \"man-ing\" his way through the film, which belies the wit that he sometimes allows a glimpse of.\n\nIt is one of the funniest, most quotable movies of all time. Full of the Coen's regular acting troop, some of whom show up for just one or two scenes, make their memorable mark and then are never heard from again.\n\nIt is a stone cold classic, and we'll still be watching it in another twenty years."

        "review_title": "Arguably the Coen Brother's funniest work, with a superb lead in Bridges",
        "review_detailed_main": "The Big Lebowski, whether you laugh during the film or not, is assuredly one of the most laid-back of the nineties. I don't mean that by saying that its main fan-base are slackers or hippies or other, but that the whole tone of the film has that air to it. The plot the Coens construct, which is as wonderfully convoluted as a 40's mystery tale (the kinds of stories they get inspired by- The Big Sleep was most likely their title goof), almost gets in the way of the main character and his friends' lives. \"The Dude\" Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) has a good, if devoid of \"meaning\", life- he bowls constantly with his crazed, Vietnam-vet friend Walter (John Goodman, also very note-worthy) and quiet friend Donny (Steve Buscemi, a fine performance based mostly on reactions), with the occasional setback or weirdo to confront him (i.e. John Turturro's Jesus, a highlight in the film's most absurd moments). Enter in a group of deranged ex-musicians turned nihilists (which include the likes of Peter Stormare and Flea), a pornographer, and a rich man with the same name as Lebowski and his family, and the Dude's cycle is turned upside down, though not knocking into his chemical intake.\n\nOn top of The Big Lebowski, at the core, one of the most odd, off-the-wall, and creative of the Coens' scripts, with a interesting story and dialog as real as it is sometimes insane, the casting is near perfect, if not so already. It's been said by the Coens that they write some of the parts specifically for the actors, and it shows because it's pulled off. Aside from some usual Coen regulars that don't disappoint, Bridges, for lack of a better term, displays his versatility in taking on this role. Often his roles are of the normal-Joe or the businessman, but what the Coens see is that with the right character he can be funny, and make the people around him just as funny. Not to say there aren't serious parts in the film, where he's put into a rut of conflict by way of the plot. But by the time the audience starts to shift its mindset, another strange, surreal, and/or hallucinogenic bit is kicked in.\n\nThrow in some unique production design, and Roger Deakins' expert eye on the scenes (will there ever be another film that captures bowling the way this film does, or at least in such scope and lack of subtlety?), and The Big Lebowski ends up as a cult classic. Not the kind of film that could really play for long in a multiplex (it made back its budget during its run, but not by much), yet one that will continue to have at least a little relevance in not just the indie crowd and Coen fans, but with the kinds of movie viewers who like to have a film on during a party or get-together. In fact, I'd say this beats films like Dazed and Confused and Mallrats as being something that can appeal to a younger (and older, depends) viewing crowd with its ridiculous set-pieces and still be a considerable artistic achievement. Look at it this way, think of the silliest, though smartest Cheech and Chong or Three Stooges film you've seen, and when filtered through a mindset that's loaded with European and film-noir influences, and you'll get The Big Lebowski. Not to mention it's one of the most quotable comedies of the 90's, and has a toe-tapping soundtrack. A+"

It's not a detective/comedy and it sure as hell isn't a bowling comedy; it's a lifestyle movie with wonderfully written characters. Jesus is a perfect example of comedic genius with a flat character. He's a pedophile bowler that has the ability to intimidate guys like the Dude, who probably doesn't really even care enough to be intimidated. But that's the type of conflict that this movie deals with. The Dude and Walter never really learn any lesson or go through any major character changes. You must keep in mind that this movie is just a crazy story whose main purpose is to express the comedic traits within the characters. Fans of character conflict should love this aspect. Those looking for a buildup and climax may not appreciate the story so much. The whole detective story is given to the audience blatantly. But, like the Dude, you become wrapped up in the craziness of all the distractions from the cast of characters such as Autobahn that are thrown into the mix. So when the story ends, you feel like the Dude; someone who just drifted along as everything sort of passed right by you. But worrying about all of it would be very un-Dude."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have been reviewing the top 100 film noir movies of all time (or 100 of the best, if not the best). And for some reason, this film was on the list. Believe me when I tell you that this movie has about as much to do with film noir as the original Frankenstein has to do with comedy. It is as funny as hell; and there are numerous outstanding performances. Among them are Philip Seymour Hoffman, who is hilarious, John Turturro, who is about as Hispanic as I am, but still very funny, Julianne Moore, who is a first-rate actress with a great sense of humor, and, of course, Jeff Bridges, who has his role of a lifetime in this film.\n\nI am a big Buscemi fan, but I did not find his role that ..satisfying. And the content for John Goodman's character was overly offensive to Vietnam Veterans (particularly the buddies with their faces in the mud lines). Goodman, who is a fine actor in both straight and comedic roles, was good in this one, despite the unfortunate dialogue he had to spew about Vietnam vets. The stereotype of the crazed Vietnam veteran was also not helped by this portrayal. Most Vietnam veterans are not crazed; we are relatively average.\n\nI do not know what Roger Ebert was drinking when he reviewed this film, but to classify it as noir is almost as silly as the film itself. Yes, there are mild noir elements in the film, but you could say the same thing about Steve Martin's Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid, which was not as funny as this movie, but had about the same noir content (which was about none). Seriously, folks, how many of you consider Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid a noir classic?"

        "review_detailed_main": "At first glance, The Big Lebowski appears to be a film about a man seeking compensation for a soiled rug. For that reason, I delayed watching it for years, anticipating that it would be difficult viewing.\n\nIn actuality, The Big Lebowski is a pleasure to watch. This is largely because it allows the audience to inhabit the headspace of the Dude, who moves through life unperturbed by external events and material losses. In seeing the world from the Dude's perspective, the viewer is encouraged to avoid getting caught up in the frustrations of daily life and instead cultivate inner contentment, or at least a more laid back attitude. In some ways, the film is disorienting because of the many repetitions in dialogue and setting. I believe this is a conscious choice by the Coens, intended to bring the audience further into alignment with the Dude by emulating the echoes and flashbacks that would be rife in the mind of a 48 year old stoner.\n\nSome critics suggest that in seeking compensation for his rug, the Dude is expressing a latent desire for order and meaning. I disagree with this interpretation. The Dude's uncharacteristic attachment to the rug is what embroils him in a string of calamitous events that test his equanimity. In my view, this is intended to convey that suffering is caused by attachment to material objects. The Coen brothers have rejected the notion that the film is conveying any particular message, so there is no definitive answer here.\n\nThis film inspired me to try my first White Russian (or as it is jokingly called in the film, a Caucasian) the following day. Unfortunately, I had an allergic reaction to the beverage and fainted in my driveway before being taken to hospital. I will therefore always have a strong sense memory associated with The Big Lebowski.\n\nMVP: Jeff Bridges as pyjamaed hero.\n\nMVQ: \"Smokey this is not 'Nam, this is bowling. There are rules\""

Now I don't think that Maude is a copy of Violet but if you listen to the way she talks and the way she leads a conversation you can hear a distinct similarity between them. The best part of the movie to make this comparison is when Hepburn is showing Montgomery Clift around her son's garden and the way she talks about flowers and her niece Catherine (Elizabeth Taylor) and then compare that to when Maude first meets The Dude and she is talking about art, the female form, sex, and her step mother Bunny. I don't know, maybe it's just me. For other Cohen Brother inspiration check out The Alan Ladd/Veronica Lake film \"The Glass Key,\" as inspiration for \"Miller's Crossing,\" and check out Akim Tamiroff as Uncle Joe Grande in \"Touch of Evil\" as a model for several characters that Jon Polito plays in a bunch of Cohen Brother's movies."

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, I love the Coen brothers. Just about every one of their films is stunningly written, with enough wit in their dialogue to rival Tarantino in his 'Pulp Fiction' form. Stunningly directed, riotously funny and brimming with unique and colourful characters, their films are always a pleasure to watch.\n\nJeff Bridges portrays Jeffrey Lebowski, a man who'd rather just be called The Dude. However, when criminals mistake him for a rich Jeffrey Lebowski (The Big Lebowski), a misinformed break-and-entry results in The Dude's prized rug getting urinated upon. \"That rug really held the room together,\" a dejected Dude remarks, and so he goes to visit The Big Lebowski, whom he considers responsible for such an unpleasant occurrence. Little does The Dude realise that his visit will bring about considerable more trouble than just a soiled rug...\n\n'The Big Lebowski,' like most Coen brothers' films, is certainly a funny and reasonably well-written story, however, I found myself slightly underwhelmed by it. A lot of the time, it felt like weird characters were simply thrown into the mix simply to be weird, without serving any real purpose. I'm yet to work out the reasons for including the Stranger (Sam Elliott), whose cowboy-type character narrates the the beginning and the end of the story, with a brief cameo appearance somewhere in the middle. The completely unnecessary breaking of the \"fourth wall\" at the end of the film just seemed out of place with the rest of the story. And how did the Stranger even know about the Dude's story, having just exchanged a few words with him at the bowling bar? It beats me, but perhaps I'm just completely missing the point.\n\nHowever, these grievances aside, it must be said that there are many genuinely funny moments in this film, most of them arising from John Goodman's perfectly-played character, Walter Sobchak. With stunning comedic timing, the Coen film regular (Barton Fink, O Brother Where Art Thou) hilariously spouts out his well-written dialogue, which usually (for no apparent reason) references Sobchak's own service in the Vietnam War, or otherwise belittles his under-appreciated and often-ignored bowling partner Donny Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi).\n\n'The Big Lebowski' is a funny film, and well worth your time. However, I was simply unable to take it seriously as a film (nor should I have tried), so I couldn't rate it any higher. It just didn't have the professional class of the Coen brothers' other films..."

John Goodman had a small role, the movie may of been more impressive if it wasn't seen as such as masterpiece. Worth watching ill admit but should not be raved about like a Pulp Fiction 2. Judge for yourself but your taste of movies would of swooped to a new low if you consider this as a 90's classic. Fargo, O brother where art thou, Paris... they can be remembered but this was just a standard movie to kill some time. Best 250 films of all time? hardly.. Feel free to comment back but don't blame me if you are utterly disappointed"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Big Lebowskiv(1998) is an enjoyable film by Coen Brothers that packs thrills , dry humor , action , wonderful songs and numerous cinematic references . Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is a stuck-in-the-70s stoner who insists on being called The Dude and loves to go bowling . He suffers a beating at the hands of thugs who are after money owed by a snutty wife who ruined some debt collectors. Being wrongly mistaken for a millionaire (David Huddleston) and along the way Jeff attempts to be compensated for his spoiled rug . While enlisting his bowling buddies (craxed, irascible John Goodman, and nice Steve Buscemi) for help while trying to find the millionaire's missing wife (Tara Reid). They figured he was a lazy, time-wasting slacker !. They were right !. Her life was in their hands. Now her toe is in the mail !. Times like these call for a Big Lebowski !. It takes guys as simple as the Dude and Walter to make a story this complicated... and they'd really rather be bowling. Lebowski: Not a man, a way of life !\n\nAn amusing and funny film in which our starring is drawn into kidnapping , attempted scamming of payoff money and more bowling . Starred by some rare characters suffering several Coanesque adventures ; what the protagonists encounter along the way are a number of surprising situations and weird roles that , when all is said and done , seem like just that individual incidents that never really add up to a whole plot . While this may seem like plot-a-plenty , it's mainly a showcase for the Cohen brothers' unique texturing of style and quirky but deep roles . Includes the Cohen's pithy dialogue , it looks and sounds marvellous . The film may not have the enigmatic elegance or emotional resonance of Barton Fink or Fargo , but it is still a prime example of the Cohen's efoortless brand of stylistic and sstorytelling brilliance . The highlight showcase is a stunning musical-bowling-fantasy sequence that would have made Busby Berkely proud . Main and support cast are pretty good . Jeff Bridges gives a sympathetic acting as the ultimate L. A. slacker Jeff \"The Dude\" Lebowski , mistaken for a millionaire of the same name and seeking restitution for a rug. Co-stars John Goodman as a fun and loud Vietnam vet who takes any opportunity into grossy obscenities. David Huddleston as the wheel-chair-bound millionare of the same name who assigns him to recover his sluttty wife performed by Tara Reid . While John Turturro steal the show as a pervert rival bowler who loves skintight lilac jumpsuits and polishing his ball.\n\nThanks to Roger Deakin's gleaming camerawork the film expand a colorful and luminous cinematography . T-Bone eccletic selection soundtrack and agreeable score by Carter Burwell . This fun and entertainining motion picture was well written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen . They have shared these duties on all of their films, but Joel has always been listed as director and Ethan as producer . The first Coen brothers film where both he and brother Ethan Coen are given directing and producing credits was Ladykillers (2004). Both of whom are part of the prestigious group of individuals to have won Oscars for writing , directing and producing in the same year, for the film No Country for Old Men (2007). Their career is splendid from first film : Blood simple (1984) to Arizona Baby (1987), Miller's crossing (1990) , Oh Brother ! (2000) ,Barton Fink (1991), the great Lebowski (1998), The Man Who Wasn't There (2001) , Intolerable Cruelty (2003) , Burn After Reading (2008) , A Serious Man (2009) , True grit (2010) ,among others . Rating : 7/10. Well worth watching , better than average. The flick will appeal to Jeff Bridges fans and Joel/Ethan Coen followers."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's rare that I feel obliged to write a review after seeing a movie but for this I felt I had to. This film does have a decent plot although not one you'd consider to be sensational. The main reason behind this film's popularity is it's script and characters. The performances in this film are flawless. Each actor is sensational and it honestly baffles me how there was no Oscar nods for any performances, or Oscar nods for anything at all. The script is funny although it's not one that would have you on the floor crying with laughter. The comedy is enhanced with excellent delivery and such memorability. There was a few scenes that had me desperate for air from laughing. Particularly the ending scene and the scene in which the dude nails a block of wood to the floor and put a chair against it for protection. Only to find it's an out swinging door. I would live to quote this movie with friends with lines such as obviously you're not a golfer, the dude abides, I'm the walrus or no I don't think he was close to cracking, but because of my age (I'm 16) it's rare people would understand what I'm saying and would just end up looking at me like I'm insane. Overall just a joy to watch. Each second is a pleasure and after each time I see it I find something new in the script that I'd missed before that makes it funnier. A true great that will forever be seen as one of the greatest cult movies of all time.\n\nP. S, I also love the conversations between the trio of The dude, Donnie and Walter, The way Walter shuts down Donnie each time he speaks and the way he constantly talks about the Vietnam war and being Jewish are hilarious."

        "review_detailed_main": "Those wacky and weird Coen Bros have come up with another off the wall masterpiece, off-beat comedy, crime thriller! The Big Lebowski is a phony business magnate/benefactor, legless war hero, who hires the lesser, and seemingly loser Dude Lebowski to deliver the million dollar ransom for his kidnapped young wife, Bunny, Tara Reid. The turn over of the ransom goes wrong and the bigger Lebowski accuses Dude of stealing the million. The much underrated Jeff Bridges plays the part of Dude, a laid back junkie bowler, to a tee! His best friend, Walter Sobchack is played by John Goodman, in one of his best roles to date. In his quest to retain the ransom, Dude encounters a bunch of Nihilists,A ticked off and thoroughly nasty Malibu police officer, and the daughter of Lebowski, played by Julianne Moore. The well meaning Sobchack manages to vandalise a brand new sports car to the chagrin of the real owner. The third part of the three stooge type bowling trio is played by the ever fluent Steve Buscemi. Ben Gazzara is the smooth operator of a Playboy type mansion, and look out for the cameo role of Sam Elliott, as \"The Stranger\"!"

Also, I found some characters haven't been merged well with the plot (even they are very meaningful like the rest of the characters as I said). That being said, these issues didn't bother me at all as I was so invested in each character and I really enjoyed every second in the movie.\n\nJeff Bridges maybe give the best performance in his career. It's really a shame he didn't get an Oscar nomination for his vivid and stellar performance in The Big Lebowski. John Goodman was great, and he had a wonderful chemistry with Steve Buscemi as well as with Jeff Bridges. Philip Seymour Hoffman didn't have a lot of time on the screen but he was so hilarious.\n\nRoger Deakins did an awesome job as usual and crafted not just a beautiful cinematography but also a very smart and shiny one that has aged (and will age) very well.\n\nThe soundtrack maybe is one of the best soundtracks ever put to movie. It's a very very underrated one.\n\nThe Big Lebowski is a delightful ride. It's one of the best Coen Brothers' movies, and hands down it's the most \"Coen Brothers\" Coen Brothers' movie.\n\n(8.5/10)"

Such a twisty, entertaining and hilarious plot with literally every actor/actress giving some of the best performances of their lives. As usual for the Coen brothers, the cinematography, soundtrack and direction are all wonderful. At the same time \"The Big Lebowski\" is a paean to Hollywood, LA noir (a sub-genre with some excellent precedents), greed, and selflessness.\n\nYou can watch this film on many levels - pure entertainment, a deeper set of character studies, and even a parable on American society that holds true to this day.\n\nThe Dude is an iconic character and worth watching TBL for alone, but there is so much else going on that - if you haven't already seen it - I won't spoil for you. If I have any advice to offer, it's don't read any reviews or plot summaries prior to watching for the first time. I wish there were movies like this still being made.\n\nAlso, by no means are the following films the same as TBL, but you might like them if you enjoy this.\n\n* Chinatown\n\n* Inherent Vice\n\n* Under the Silver Lake\n\n* L. A. Confidential\n\n* Mulholland Drive\n\n* Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\n\n* After Dark, My Sweet\n\n* The Long Goodbye\n\n* Brick."

But this film is not as great a film as it is rated as it lacks truly redemptive qualities of reconciliation, or say, tying together a greater purpose behind it, let alone a great plot like say its parallels with Raymond Chandler's 1939 novel, The Big Sleep, of which it does no justice to in being loosely related. However, in another sense, it's greater purpose can be looked at differently: that since its the ultimate slacker film, it has no need for a greater purpose in the first place. But, that's just like, my opinion, man. Let's say, just like the rug that 'held the room together', Bridges, the Dude, in an oddly engaging way, was the only thing that held the film together for me. And save also for an unbelievably spaced out and unconventionally witty and nihilistic (which is ironic considering the brilliant Coen brothers seemed to be mocking nihilists) script, not the plot, the film is one of the most anti-establishment in terms of relativism.\n\nOf course, there is a certain sad genius to it all, owing in some sense to the elements that lie in the film's references to double crossing and pseudo complications, of course, with updated time-lines (1991- Sad'm and I-raq) and anti-yuppie achievement ethos coupled with unconventional 'heroes', that is complete with the standard issue oddball fest of characters in Coen Bros parlance (they seem to be competing with Fellini for numbers of colorful characters). This film's best bits are in fact not the parallels with the Big Sleep but its unpredictably predictable plot directions which may be part underbelly psychological black comedy and part pseudo film noir laced with double entendres. The plot is not the main steal, rather its almost a straw man, as it is just a vehicle for the hilariously zany dialog between characters' to platform itself. Want to know just how insane the dialog was? Read the memorable quotes from the film on the Internet. There are even parallels in this film that might lead some to speak of a religion in 'Dudism' and its enlightenment of non-ideals, and I bet there are some crazed converts out there right now, lost in its futility. Nonetheless, because of these slacker ideals and the Dude's apathy or value system (relativism) toward life, and however I feel about the futility of it all, obviously, the 'Dude' character must have been classic enough to warrant such attention.\n\nIn the story, The Dude obviously steals the plot, for without him there is no impetus, after all, the plot is that he is forced out of slack jawed Bohemia as a result of his rug getting micturated on by a pornographer's thugs whose boss wants cash owed by the young trophy wife of a rich tycoon who is his namesake. Hilarity ensues under series after series of incredulous circumstances when the Dude asks the Bigger Lebowski for compensation and in turn gets the Big L offering a 'cash' job for him. The dude loses the 'cash' only to find he the had been duped in a 'ringer for a ringer' when the paraquat tycoon wanted his porn acting wife dead and handed him an empty briefcase. The Dude assumed the wife kidnapped herself, and then later discovers that nihilists want a share of the money and are out to kill him. Big L's daughter gets acquainted with the Dude as she opposes the plan, and a PI trails the Dude looking for the wife, who in the end, had just gone away for the weekend, in a shock Hitchcock-esquire secondary macguffin on top of the basic macguffin of the 'rug'.\n\nSome unique film techniques are also used in this film, including blending soundtracks from previous scenes by way of songs being played on radios, or having dialog repeated, such as when the Dude constantly rehashes phrases he heard in the previous scenes (from Julianne Moore's character, Bush's speech, etc). One of the most quirky bits of the film can be described by a phrase from the Dude yet again- occasional 'acid flashbacks'- spaced out hallucination scenes where the cannabis smoking Dude flies through the bowling lane, or over LA. Making the bricolage plot even more colorful is the character of Walter, played brilliantly by John Goodman, who is a highlight of the film- representing a Vietnam scarred war veteran who associates events in the world with the horrors he has experienced. Yet, what is interesting about Walter is that it seemed he is modeled as a possible cross between the Jewish German Walter Kaufmann (the irony again) and an anarchistic gun crazy war machine- a rambunctious combination that results in lines like 'at least the Nazis had ethos' and so on. Coen fave Steve Buscemi's character adds the fragile dimension by asking the obvious questions and being constantly told to shut up in a reference to their previous hit, Fargo, before dying off unceremoniously. Likewise, many of the other characters are borderline offensive to the mainstream yet one can't help but crack up in wake of their absolutely crazy antics- the visual gag that saw the Dude trace pornographer Jackie Treehorn sketching a giant erection was an absolute nut-job and case in point. The stranger has a memorable cowboy cameo just for 'style' while Da Farino's scenes were a study in comedic nothingness. And that's what this film is- nothingness that served no purpose- I mean, as I said, it's the dude, man. El duderino for those who think brevity is...but most important now, don't forget to sip that white Russian while you slack off watching this.\n\nBy Stephen Thanabalan"

        "review_detailed_main": "Ehm...they did not finish the story.\n\nWere we not supposed to notice or were we not supposed to care? Towards the end Big Lebowski had about 5 or 6 story threads going, but left 2 of them untied at the end, one of which was a relatively major one. There is unexplained plot point or two. All in all, the story ends up being kind of disappointing.\n\nThen again, the story is not very important because this movie is all about the characters. The Dude and Walter Sobchak, the main characters played by Jeff Bridges and John Goodman respectively are awesome and memorable creations. Yes, Steve Buscemi is there too, but he doesn't do a lot.\n\nAll of the characters in this film are eccentric. On the one hand, that is what gives this movie its colour, but on the other hand, this approach to character creation feels a step below simply having good believable people who are different from one another in a subtle but perceivable way.\n\nYou and I, we too could come up with some crazy personalities that would as a result be memorable: we can create a guy who makes racist jokes every time he appears on screen and smokes a whole lot so we will make him have two or three cigarettes in his moth at all times. Making ridiculous characters is easy and lazy. And while the Dude and Walter ultimately do work as characters, some of the others in this movie do not.\n\nThere are a few funny moments in this film, but there are equally few jokes that fail. The dialogue can be pretty good, pretty stupid and sometimes both at the same time.\n\nThe film has a number of interesting looking scenes, mostly when the main character is knocked out or drugged. The music covers the visuals with a layer of rock, complementary to the Dude's and Walter's 60s persona. It is safe to say that the film goes for a specific style and nails it. It is only unfortunate that it is a bit more style than substance.\n\nBig Lebowski is like the weird friend in your party who is awkward and sometimes ruins things, but he has in time grown on you and you know that the party just wouldn't be the same without him. In that aspect he is very much like the main characters of this film."

The two scenes in which a topless woman appeared were obviously inserted just so she could be shown, but there was no point other than that one. The scene in which a Corvette was destroyed was completely predictable, and it unfolded in a strange way, and then faded away.\n\nJulianna Moore was the best part of the film, and Joe Pesci's talents were wasted on a trivial part for which he clearly had no enthusiasm.\n\nJeff Bridges practiced in his role for his academy award as the character was identical.\n\nOnce again, Hollywood insists that all drug usage is good, lack of moral character is good, drinking is good, and being a bum is good if you have a heart of gold.\n\nThe film was long, too."

Instead of a competent detective however, they got a incompetent bowler thrown into the situation. The funniest thing is instead of smoking cigarettes like Humphrey in \"The Big Sleep\", the dude smokes joints. Walter played by John Goodman is also excellent. Every scene he is in is practically carried by him (Pulling a gun on Smokey, the money drop at the bridge, fighting the nihilists). His constant unrelated reminders that he saw his buddies die face down in the mud in Vietnam are also very funny. The supporting cast does good too (Buschemi, Seymour-Hoffman, Moore). Highly recommend this very funny and entertaining film. It might be the best Coen Brothers movie to be honest, although \"Fargo\" and \"No Country for old men\" are close."

Steve Buscemi plays a timid 'Donnie', constantly under the thumb of the domineering, Vietnam obsessed 'Walter' (Goodman). Whilst it is hard to pick an outstanding performance...John Goodman is stellar, consistently funny...but watch out for Jesus. Also, Flea has a brief cameo. All in all, a fantastic film, one of my all time top ten...I guess that sometimes there's a film which, well, it's the film for it's time and place."

There happens to be another Lebowski who is a millionaire, so a couple of guys mistake the dude for him when they are looking for a payoff.\n\nNow, the eccentric plot revolves around how 'The Dude' manages to deliver a million dollars to the kidnappers of The Lebowski's wife, that is the millionaire Lebowski.\n\nThe movie is filled with incredibly hilarious dialogues and some outrageous actions by the characters. The cinematography is fantastic and there are certain dream sequences which have been captured magnificently. The Big Lebowski has all the ingredients that are required for being a classic that will be remembered for decades to come. If you want a truly exhilarating cinematic experience, then go ahead and watch this movie now."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Coen brothers do have a special talent for magnificent opening scenes. The opening scene of \"The big Lebowski\" is very akin to the opening scene of \"No country for old men\" (2007). We see a prairi landscape and we hear a voiceover talk with a somewhat smoky old voice.\n\nBut then all of sudden the city of Los Angelos appears and the voice over (quote) \"lost his train of thought\" (unquote). This is no wonder because he is introducing Jeff Lebowksi alias \"The Dude\" (played by Jeff Bridges). This character is somewhat puzzling because it seems to be a somewhat outdated hippie. When the voice over says that he is \"The man for his time and place. He fits right in there\", he could not be more wrong. \"The Dude\" still lingeres in the Woodstock period, while his friend Sobchak (John Goodman) sees everything through the spectacles of the Vietnam war.\n\n\"The big Lebowski\" has a great cast but it really is the film of Jeff Bridges. Bridges is a great actor with an imposing career. As a young man he was already convincing in \"The last picture show\" (1971, Peter Bogdanovich) and more than 10 years after \"The big Lebowksi\" he was still shining in movies like \"True Grit\" (2010, Joel & Ethan Coen) and \"Hell or high water\" (2016, David Mackenzie).\n\nA funny fact is that while in \"The big Lebowski\" a kidnapping is combined with a rather dull hobby like bowling, in the previous Coen film (\"Fargo\", 1996) kidnapping is combined with an even more dull hobby (collecting stamps)."

With a dynamic and rollercoaster ride story, fantastic acting, and a great set of actors and characters. But for me, besides a few funny moments, I didn't fall in love with it, and find the latter half of the movie much weaker the more convoluted it becomes.\n\nDirecting is strong, creative stuff as well, the dream sequences are fun, though sometimes overstay their welcome. That said on a technical level some lovely transitions and smooth movements, aiding to the general feel of the story. By all means it's a not bog standard movie, it's very well shot. Pacing was fine, though again the latter half just adds too much to the mix.\n\nActing and characters, the main strength of this movie (+writing). Everyone preforms their best. Shoutout to Turturro ''Jesus'' as one of the funniest and side characters and great performance (as expected, he never fails). Bridges and Goodman though, what a great combo. Goodman was fantastic. Walter as a character was infuriating, so excellent and a testament how to do a dumb character. Bridges of course is perfect. Never failed. Just fantastic all around the main hook. And oh yes, Sam Elliott.. perfect.\n\nThe writing made for some iconic lines still relevant today, and if you're like me and haven't seen the movie yet some scenes just suddenly line up and you think ''I know what's coming'' but also some scenes don't and those are the funniest of the bunch. Just great writing all round, dialog writing. For the story, it's not that solid, it's convoluted, takes huge shortcuts, and all in all feels very secondary to the rest. If anything holds the movie down for me it's the story, it was neither satisfying, mysterious nor engaging enough. Imo a story with less elements that pull the Dude out would've been better. The Malibu scenes for example are wasted time. Also the blue beetle scene.\n\nMusic is fun and dynamic. Nice and versatile and keeps the pacing in tact. No main score though, just known music. VFX, there's some and most of it is fine, greenscreen is noticeable but it kind of fits the style of the music that it isn't all slick and perfect.\n\nNot a movie a fell in love with and hopefully a Coen brothers movie will be able to capture me at some point. Lot's to watch."

This movie is a series of loosely connected comedy sketches (well, some hardly connected at all). The result is an absurdest comedy that had very few laughs for me.\n\nI did not find The Dude at all appealing as a person. How much is there to admire in someone whose life goals seem to be bowling and drinking white Russians? I do give Bridges credit for inhabiting the role. John Goodman's character really grated on me--his passions seem to be bowling and the f word.\n\nThe positives: the scenes with John Turturro gave me some laughs; the scenes filmed from within a bowling ball were an interesting curiosity; some non sequiturs were worth a few chuckles.\n\nI guess one person's humor is another person's tedium.

There's simply so much to see, from the absurd musical sequences to the sociopathic behavior of John Goodman's character Walter Sobchak. Just trying to make sense of the convoluted and completely ridiculous plot is a game onto itself. The movie has an enormous amount of quotable lines and the dialogue is some of the Coen brothers' finest.\n\nThe characters are all imaginative and memorable, with Jeff Bridges and John Goodman wrestling for the best part. Goodman's Walter Sobchak is easily one of the most unsympathetic and frankly crazy Vietnam-vet characters in cinema, what with him constantly referring to his battles in Vietnam or spouting obscenities at everyone in sight. But Bridges' the Dude is just as charming: writing a cheque of 0,69$, crashing his car after dropping a joint on his lap and constantly drinking white russians. Even the small characters like the side-splittingly hilarious Jesus Quintana, the police chief of Malibu or the black taxi driver you will laugh at time and time again. The amount of small but memorable characters is almost too much to count.\n\nThe movie has some issues, though. Because of the narrative being so convoluted and not being the point anyway, the film feels at times like a series of isolated sketches than a consistent whole. It can also be very confusing for first time viewers who will try to follow the plot. To fully enjoy this movie one has to be in a certain mindset.\n\nRecommendation: Like all Coen brothers films, The Big Lebowski is not for everyone. But for those who enjoy this sort of comedy, finding a better film of this sort is hard."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've never been a huge fan of American stoner comedies; as somebody who is staunchly anti-drugs, the type of humour in these movies doesn't appeal and I usually just find them dumb. Not so with THE BIG LEBOWSK, the cult classic movie by the Coen brothers; this one's well-written and features an endearing cast of typically kooky characters in a plot that is very reminiscent of the Coen brothers style.\n\nJeff Bridges plays the likable lead as an exasperated chump who refuses to lose his mild-mannered world view despite getting mixed up in a plot involving reclusive millionaires and revolutionary weirdos. It helps that he has a fine supporting cast, in particular John Goodman who is cast completely against type as a far-right nut job who word has it was modelled on John Milius. Steve Buscemi is also a delight, even though he doesn't appear much; I tend to find everything that comes out of this guy's mouth to be completely hilarious.\n\nThe script is incessantly profane and yet, as in a Tarantino movie, the bad language has a natural flow and rhythm to it; it never feels forced or unpleasant. The oddball plot flows along nicely and there are few slow spots or mistakes along the way (an excruciating turn from Julianne Moore unwisely attempting a British accent being my only real problem with this). THE BIG LEBOWSKI, although not my favourite Coen brothers movie due to the subject matter, is a lot of goofy fun nonetheless."

        "review_detailed_main": "Like true heirs apparent of the great Billy Wilder, Joel and Ethan Coen can take any genre and place their own idiosyncratic DNA on it that stands head and shoulders above anyone else's. In the case of THE BIG LEBOWSKI, their follow-up to the Oscar winning FARGO, they tackle the urban milieu of Raymond Chandler.... albeit one through a drug hazed lens. It has become such a cult classic that there are Big Lebowski conventions in bowling alleys all over the world, where attendees arrive dressed up as their favorite characters.\n\nThe cult status isn't limited just to conventions. In 2005, and I'm not kidding here, a religion was founded called Dudeism, also known as the Church of the Latter-day Dude, with over 200,000 \"parishioners\" devoted to the philosophies of its protagonist. If that wasn't bizarre enough, two species of spider found in Africa are also named in honor of the movie, the anelosimus biglebowski and the anelosimus dude. Even the Coens couldn't have seen all that coming.\n\nAfter almost three decades in the industry, Jeff Bridges has the role of a lifetime as Jeffrey \"Dude\" Lebowski, an unemployed yuppie slacker whose laziness is the stuff of legend. A former 60s radical, the Dude writes cheques for amounts as small as 69\u00a2, smokes marijuana on more than a regular basis, is constantly late with the rent money, and enjoys bowling with his buddies Walter and Donnie. He's ingested so much pot in his life that he hardly comes up with his own sayings anymore; he just recycles other people's comments. \"This aggression will not stand\". \"The parlance of our times\". \"The Dude abides\".\n\nReturning to his bungalow one night, Dude is accosted by two thugs who mistake him for another Jeff Lebowski, a crippled millionaire whose trophy wife Bunny owes a lot of money to their boss. Realizing their error, the two leave his premises, but not before one of them relieves himself on Dude's beloved rug. It's an absolute travesty of epic proportions because....man, that rug really tied the room together!\n\nCommiserating at the bowling alley with Walter and Donnie, El Duderino is convinced to seek compensation for his rug from the other Lebowski because it was his wife they were looking for. Besides, the millionaire can afford it. Needless to say, the meeting between the dual namesakes does not go well, as the Republican \"Big Lebowski\" and His Dudeness could not be further apart in politics and lifestyle.\n\nLater on, the Dude is contacted by Big Lebowski's private secretary Brandt (Philip Seymour Hoffman) because it appears that Bunny has been abducted, possibly by the same goons that befouled Dude's rug. Skeptical, but enticed by a a generous fee, His Dudeness agrees to be a bagman with the ransom money. Against all logic, he allows Walter to tag along for the exchange as a bodyguard.\n\nBeing a Vietnam vet, Walter has a hair trigger temper that explodes without warn, to be followed afterwards by contemplative calm. Convinced without a doubt that Bunny arranged her own abduction to extort money from her husband, Walter not only brings a gun with him, but also a valise filled with dirty underwear to use as a ringer. Thanks to his hair brained scheme, they manage to lose the undies, the ransom, and the Dude's old rust bucket of a car before the night is over....and oh, yea, and no Bunny!\n\nFeeling low, El Duderino's spirits pick up when he's contacted by Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore), the Big Guy's daughter. Maude is an avant-garde artist with a refined education and slightly clipped accent who, with her father, is a co-trustee of the Lebowski Foundation. Apparently, the ransom money belonged to her late mother's charities and was intended for philanthropic use only. Suspicious of her much younger stepmother's kidnapping, Maude is convinced that the former adult film starlet is \"taking her father for the proverbial ride\", and hires Dude to recover the missing money, for which he will receive a handsome finder's fee.\n\nOverall, THE BIG LEBOWSKI is one big hoot, and that's like, my opinion, man."

        "review_detailed_main": "The story of the big lebowski is as difficult as funny. It begins with a lazy man in Los Angeles who's parents named him Jef Lebowski, but he prefers if people call him \"the dude\", played magnificently by Jeff Bridges. One evening two men come into his house and confuse the dude with Jeff Lebowski, a millionaire, where they want to steal from. One of the two \"pees\" on his rug and the dude wants a new rug. That's where the trouble starts. His bowling-mates Ronny (Steve Buscemi)and Walter (John Goodman)try to help him but do more harm than good, Jeff Lebowski's wife gets kidnapped and the dude has to help her back. But is she really kidnapped, is she really his wife and what's doing Maude Lebowski(great role by Julianne Moore)in all of this? Between all this adventure they have to play a tournament and might meet the incredible Jesus (John Turturro), who is a great bowler but \"also a pervert\". The movie contains hilarious scenes and unbelievable trips and is packed with great one liners. The dude is an anti-hero who does the things his way and most of the time, that's very relaxed. It's also relaxed for us as a viewer and the dude at some way is even inspiring. Maybe the Coen brothers made with Fargo a better movie, i was caught immediately by this one and since then i seen it over and over again but i never got bored. The film is based on a friend of the Coen brothers, who called himself the dude and Jeff bridges did nothing more for to make this movie then to eat and drink. \"the easiest preparation i ever had for a role\" as he said. It proved that he did his preparation well and its actually strange he didn't even get an Oscar nomination for it. If you never like to bowl, you will love it now. \"You roll!!\""

In this movie, he try different thing, it's to make a comedy genre films. But i think he specialize at character depth. Every movie he made such as \"no country for old men\" and \"true grit\" have very strong lead character depth in the films. And he also success in \"the big lebowsky\", the characters depth portrayal (Dude,Walter,Donny,nearly all of the actor and actress) were very exceptional and convincing.\n\nSome people said the best thing from this movie was it's humor, they said it's clever. But not for me, this movie has more artistry inside. the strenght of this movie definitely not from it's humor, but from the other things such as character performances, photography, rich script, art-decoration, and music although they're not reach a word \"superb\". We can't compare the humor from \"the big lebowsky\" with \"monty python and the holy grail\" (most intellect comedy), TBL was nothing. But when you see the performances, it is unbelievable. Dude portrayal was astounding even dude was a hard role to play but he did it, and the supporting all took part also. the music really match with the genre of the movie. The script was soft and light but it's clever, not too much badwords like comedy genre movie nowadays.\n\nFor me, this movie has good entertaining aspect. Because it's light, easy plot to follow, soft and rich script, with great music, and extraordinary acting. If you want got entertained from your stress in the weekend, watch this with your warm people, friends, family, or couple, and i assure you all will got a great experience."

        "review_detailed_main": "This my absolute favourite film of all time. I love most of the Coen brothers' work, but this is their masterpiece. I love films that have a strong sociopolitical message but are not melodramatic and instead bring it in a more fun or subtle way. This film delivers great commentary in promoting pacifism and nihilism, but at the same time it's a hilarious comedy, and a parody of the neo-noir genre (even the title itself is a nod to neo-noir, referring to the 1946 noir classic \"The Big Sleep\"). And most importantly, it does all those things perfectly.\n\n\"The Big Lebowski\" is a film about nothing, but that's kind of the point. Like in film noir, the plot is overcomplicated. Even the Coen brothers themselves have admitted to not even being able to entirely follow it. It's about the journey, man. The crime in this case is very ironic and satirical. Our 'detective' is a slacker who calls himself \"The Dude\" and spends his days bowling and smoking weed. Our crime is that said Dude is the victim of theft: his rug has been micturated upon and stolen. And that makes The Dude very upset, because it really tied his room together. Much potential for comedy in that plot, and the script more than delivers. Almost every line in the film is laugh-out-loud funny and the actors in the film all have brilliant comedic timing. Superb casting.\n\nIn this film, the Coen brothers seriously criticise the war. The Dude's sidekick, Walter, is a Vietnam war veteran and look what it did to him. The poor guy is seriously disturbed. It is even mentioned that The Dude's disabled name double, Jeffrey Lebowski, is in a wheelchair because of the war. The film also conveys the message that money doesn't buy happiness (which is a theme the Coen brothers have played with in most of their films). Almost all the characters (even the self-proclaimed 'nihilists') are after money and nothing good comes of it in the end. In the end, the Coen brothers are promoting The Dude's pacifist and abstemious lifestyle.\n\n\"The Big Lebowski\" is a perfect film that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good comedy. Everything in this film stands out, from the acting to the writing to the music to Roger Deakins' fantastic cinematography (those dream sequences!). 10/10"

Although perhaps the dude is a great character... the plot doesn't really go anywhere even though i though it had a lot of potential, it just came off weird.

The first attempt failed but eventually in February 1963 Qasim was killed in a Baath Party coup which was followed by an orgy of bloodshed. The leftists were all murdered and the lists of those to be killed were supplied by the CIA! Saddam eventually became dictator of Iraq and we played him like an instrument. George Bush Sr. needed to look strong so April Glaspie, (our Ambassador to Iraq) when approached by Saddam regarding Kuwait invited him to invade Kuwait by stating the following: \"We have no opinion on your Arab-Arab conflicts, such as your dispute with Kuwait. Secretary Baker has directed me to emphasize the instruction, first given to Iraq in the 1960s, that the Kuwait issue is not associated with America.\" We were setting him up to make Bush Sr. look like a strong leader. Anyone who spent the least amount of time reading between the lines knew this at the time, yet a horrible slaughter ensued that was so freaking unnecessary, but hey \"money trumps peace\" (quote from George Bush Jr.), in reality actually it's really more than just money! Okay enough of my rant to sum it up I loved the movie but cringed at the unnecessary propaganda that conveniently predated the release of the PNAC position paper! The performances were magnificent especially Jeff and John. I encourage everyone to watch it but be aware it's really a propaganda piece designed to get you ready for the next Iraq war! But I must say despite my misgivings I will always cherish this film and will remember it fondly in particular the performances by Jeff and John!"

Also starring are John Turturro as a sex offender, and Philip Seymour Hoffman as a servant. FYI, when John Goodman said all that stuff about Judaism, you may have thought that it was total nonsense given his character, but it was all totally accurate.\n\nTo think: John Goodman starred in four movies within two months.

        "review_detailed_main": "If you were a fan of \"Fargo,\" you might just like \"The Big Lebowski,\" a bizarre comedy whose hero (if that is the appropriate word) is played by Jeff Bridges as a spaced-out junkie who lives in Los Angeles, unemployed, with a trashy apartment and few belongings. His name is Lebowski, but he is known by his friends as The Dude, and he prefers that moniker rather than his birth name.\n\nEvery evening Dude goes bowling with his best buddies, Walter (John Goodman) and Donny (Steve Buscemi). Walter is a Vietnam veteran, and in his perception, all incidents relate to the war. \"What does the Vietnam War have to do with anything?\" Dude asks him at a fragile moment in both their lives. Instead of disputing, Walter gives him a big bear hug.\n\nThe story begins with a humorous and self-aware voice-over by the narrator, played by Sam Elliot in a few recurring cameos. He informs us that Dude's adventure started on an eventful night not very long ago, when a duo of criminals broke into his house in search of The Big Lebowski, a local millionaire who happens to share Dude's last name. After dunking Dude's face into a toilet bowl and realizing that they've attacked the incorrect individual, the pair of idiots urinate on Dude's rug and flee the apartment.\n\nDude figures that the only man truly responsible for the incident is Lebowski himself, so he makes a trip out to his mansion and is informed by Lebowski's assistant (portrayed by Philip Seymour Hoffman with the perfect amount of nervousness) that Lebowski's wife has been kidnapped and is being held for ransom. Suspecting that she is in the custody of the two men who attacked Dude, Lebowski offers the slacker a chance to be the courier of his ransom fee. \"Her life is in your hands,\" Lebowski tells him. He promises him some cash to transport a briefcase containing the money, and Lebowski agrees to help him out.\n\nUnfortunately, the kidnappers never receive their ransom, and Dude's car is stolen, along with Lebowski's money. It just so happens that Lebowski's unfaithful wife owed some money to a trio of German nihilists, as well as an adult filmmaker and an assortment of other odd creatures, and now Lebowski is being targeted for the cash. Everyone seems to think that the briefcase is in his possession, and he is threatened that he will lose his \"Johnson\" unless it is returned. Fearing for his life (and more importantly, his Johnson) Dude takes comfort in Walter, who tracks down the 15-year-old teenager who stole the car and the briefcase and has apparently bought a sports car with a small portion of the briefcase's contents. \"See this Tommy? This is what happens when you mess with a stranger!\" Walter yells at the boy as he single-handedly demolishes the sports car. We all anticipate the obvious punch line far ahead of time, but the result is nevertheless extremely funny.\n\nThe Coen Brothers, Ethan and Joel, are extremely gifted filmmakers. They burst onto screens across the nation in 1984 with their indie classic \"Blood Simple,\" which starred Frances McDormand and Dan Hedaya, the former of whom would later star in \"Fargo\" as the bumbling police officer Marge Gunderson.\n\nAs usual, the Coens fall back on their quirky characters for comic relief and enjoyable antics, particularly Buscemi, who is one of the best character actors in Hollywood, and who also manages to be funny in whichever role he chooses - despite having to say anything funny at all. In \"Fargo\" he was the blundering kidnapper, Carl, and in \"The Big Lebowski,\" he lets his hair part across his head and hang low across his face, completely changing his entire pattern of speech. He's the goofy little squirt who tags along with Dude and Walter, and manages to repeat everything they say and ask questions about discussions long after they have ended. \"You're like a child who has wandered into the middle of a movie and wants to know what's going on!\" Walter tells him. \"What's your point, Walter?\" he asks. But it's the innocent nature of his tone that leads us to like him, and it's Walter's crazy antics that makes us feel attached to him, and it's The Dude's trademark humor that makes us enjoy watching him. The Coens have succeeded at making a great comedy with characters that actually have their own characteristics.\n\nBut it is the Coens' eloquent use of proverbial language that is really what elevates the film above all else. The script is wonderful and witty. This has some of the best dialogue I have ever heard, ranking up there with \"Pulp Fiction\" and the work of Elmore Leonard. Walter's rants consume much of the dialogue, which I think is fine.\n\n\"The Big Lebowski\" is a movie with considerably large structural flaws and weaknesses. Yet the film seems to know this, letting the audience in on the secret during the introductory voice-over narration. \"Aw, I've lost my train of thought,\" we're told, as The Stranger mumbles on about the movie's plot. And towards the end, we're all told by The Stranger that he sincerely hopes we enjoyed the story, even if it's nothing special. Yup, that about sums it all up. \"The Big Lebowski\" is a movie with a lot of joy, wit, and wicked humor: three reasons you've got to see one of the most enjoyable films of the past decade."

This time with a hippy twist in Los Angeles, when the unsuspecting, self-medicated, \"The Dude\" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), gets mistaken by shady debt collectors, as someone else and in the process, his rug gets soiled. Seeking payback for the rug, he goes to the real Lebowski for restitution, but accepts a deal to make the payment exchange to the debt collectors for the millionaire Lebowski. He enlists the aid of his bowling pals, Walter (John Goodman) and Theodore (Steve Buscemi). From there they screw things up and get into a conspiracy involving Lebowski's missing wife, Maude (Julianne Moore), porn producers and nihilists.\n\nWhat Bridges, Goodman and Buscemi come up with is one of the best comedy trios seen in modern film. The patter that is thrown around between Bridges and Goodman is hilarious. You can feel Goodman's Walter, irritating Bridges' \"The Dude\" throughout the entire film. There also are other plot arcs that involve a colorfully, overly competitive bowler named Jesus (John Turturro) and the oddly eccentric life of Moore's millionaire Maude. Her encounters with the Dude are always interesting.\n\nThis film comes with a great soundtrack that helps propel the drug-induced wacky life of Jeffrey Lebowski. I didn't even get to mention the narrator and the Dude's conscience, Sam Elliott? All Sam has to do is start talking and he's already doing a great job. This is such a funny, good film. It is the ludicrousness of the whole situation, that the Dude has to face, that creates the comedic energy that makes this another Coen classic.\n\n8.9 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB."

It turns out his young wife Bunny owes money to a few people - one of them being Jackie Treehorn. Dude manages to get a rug from the house, but in time we learn the rug has sentimental value to Jeff's daughter, and she wants it back.\n\nWhen Bunny is kidnapped, Jeff asks Dude to deliver the ransom money. Dude's obnoxious friend, Walter (John Goodman) decides to go with him, and no thanks to him the plan goes horribly wrong. Now, the bad guys are after them, and Jeff wants his money back. But still there's more here than meets the eye...\n\nThe film has some very interesting visuals, but it is definitely an acquired taste. I therefore don't think I can recommend it to everyone. There's also a lot of swearing in the movie. I mean, jeez, do they swear enough, you think?? The performances from the entire cast was very good, but I did find Walter a bit of an overbearing character - well, more than just a bit... He was annoying at times.\n\n'The Big Lebowski' is a unique film that can't really be compared to anything else, so you're either going to love it for that reason, or hate it.

So goes The Dude as he appears in \"The Big Lebowski.\"\n\nMixing the once-disparate ingredients of dark comedy, stoner flick, and L.A. noir with telltale signs of the classic buddy movie, it's likely the genius casting of Jeff Bridges as the leisure-adamant Jeffery \"The Dude\" Lebowski that most acutely prescribed greatness for this one-of-a-kind film. The opportunity for an iconic performance was sure to have gone unrealized if placed in lesser-skilled hands, and Bridges' middle-aged, self-realized Dude is set into full motion by terrific fellow slackers of their own unique brands: Endearingly hostile Vietnam vet Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and the charmingly carefree Donny Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi) team with The Dude to squelch the machismo-driven bowling game of convicted Jesus Quintana (a remarkable John Turturro). Yet when a pair of arm breakers mistake him for a SoCal fat cat who shares his Lebowski surname, The Dude seeks out this supposed \"Big Lebowski\" and demands recompense. \"The Big Lebowski\" then begins its next-level ascent to wildly creative zeniths, mixing surrealist fantasy, bowling, and suspect private eye work into a joyously burlesque stew. We dial straight in to The Dude's laissez fare mindset as he wanders into an ensemble of wonderfully sketched characters placed throughout fascinating scenes.\n\nIn their interviews, the Coen brothers downplay what they surely must know they achieved with \"The Big Lebowski.\" In Bridges' manifestation, we do see the idler -- but we also see the possibilities of a truly carefree existence realized only by living comfortably in one's own skin. And that, perhaps, is this comedy's most aspirational of its many achievements. \"The Big Lebowski\" has a seat on the rug in the highest tier of uniquely great movies. - (Was this review of use to you? If so, let me know by clicking \"Helpful.\" Cheers!)"

John Goodman performs in as close to a leading performance a supporting role can be. Jeff Bridges steals the show, as he was intended to do, and portrays possibly the best character ever filmed--The Dude. He integrates the intended simplicity of The Dude's lifestyle, with the chaotic complexity of his philosophies and personality. Absolutely a must-see for anyone who gives a damn about breathing."

What if-\" - by this point they're already laughing themselves silly, and they're right: this stuff is very funny. But it doesn't add up to anything.\n\nThis is easily their most disjointed film (their only disjointed film, actually), and their least involving. But it's worth seeing once, if only for the wonderfully conceived central character (Jeff Bridges in a pitch-perfect performance); for Steve Buscemi's skillful, subtly hilarious puppy-dog performance; and for moments such as the narrator saying near film's end that \"it's good to know the Dude's out there\", a statement made humorous by the fact that the main character couldn't be less of a hero."

There is so much buildup that I expected something really grand as a climax.\n\nThere isn't really a climax..unless you count The Dude knocking Maude up.\n\nThings do get basically tied up, but not everything, and not very satisfactorily...did I spell that right?

Because this is once for every 50 people that told me this movie was the funniest most entertaining movie EVER. After years of being berated at parties and get-togethers with people spewing line after line from the movie, I gave in last week and rented it.\n\nWow.\n\nIt's so bad on so many levels it's hard to describe. Let me be very very clear: It's not funny. At all. It's mildly amusing in parts but of the six people I watched it with, no one laughed once. Not once. I don't think it's a spoiler to tell you the language is sickeningly bad. Up there with Team America bad. Like Scarface bad. There is one reason and one reason only that this movie is popular: College aged men (or guys who wish they were college aged) own the DVD and watch it repeatedly. After watching the movie once (and not laughing), they then watch it repeatedly memorizing the movie. They sit around the DVD owner's sectional couch elbowing each other before each \"big\" scene almost spilling their friend's beer and yelling, \"HERE IT IS! HERE IT IS! HE\"S GONNA SAY IT!\" They then laugh at how clever they are. They're part of \"The DUDE\" club and they are very, very special indeed.\n\nThis is the most unfunny movie I have ever seen. Other than Scarface and Team America, the movie contains the foulest most unnecessary language I've ever heard in a movie, and overall is one of top five worst movies I've ever seen (and yes, this includes You Tube cat movies)."

If you care about plots, suspense etc. this isn't going to be your cup of tea. The people I know that like this film tend to be film connoisseurs, intellectual males, peaceful, well balanced individuals.\n\nThe Coen Brothers went all out on this film. Every member of the cast made the performance of their career in this film, the cinematography is fantastic, there are so many scenes to be seen, the soundtrack is brilliant etc. etc. but what this film is all about is the dialogue. If you're a fan of films like Pulp Fiction and Fight Club where it's the excellent dialogue that brings you back then this is the ultimate film for you.\n\nI watched this by myself on a movie channel around the time of its release and a couple of years later when my younger brother told me to watch this film I couldn't remember a thing about it. I gave it another watch and half enjoyed it. My brother convinced me to watch it again so I did. This time I loved it and by the time I'd seen it 4 times it became my favourite film of all time.\n\nAfter 3-4 viewings you think Jeff Bridges' 'Dude' character is the greatest movie character of all time and that he should have won an Oscar. But by the time you've seen it 6+ you realise that the greatest movie character of all time is actually John Goodman's 'Walter' and it is he who should have received an Oscar for this film.\n\nThe more you watch it the more you understand the characters and find it more and more funny.\n\nYou end up with one of the most quotable films and find it hard to believe that any movie fan doesn't like it.\n\nThis is just my opinion man."

The film is a deft blend of straight-faced humour, farce, and satire with some surrealistic dream sequences thrown in, and may be one big 'in' joke to the Coens, who based many of the characters on people they know. The script is great and entire cast outstanding. Bridge's character has become something of a slacker icon - there is even a 'church' dedicated to celebrating his easygoing philosophy.

Plus of course the mighty Jeff Bridges, with the great portrait of DUDISM he offers us, and his phenomenal supporting actor, John Goodman, who doesn't wait for his time to shine to pull out the big guns. Speaking of plot, it might not be a kind of conventional comedy as we already know, and the beyond belief executions that it offers us through the movie will persuade you about my opinion. I had attempted to be hard on this movie and bring up some negative points, but I have to admit that you can't find a movie as sharp and witty as this masterpiece.

This film is funny without ever trying to be; which is a big contrast to the over-the-top comedies of the '90s like Dumb and Dumber (1994) and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994). The comedic nature of this film is more in-line with films like Bill Murray's classic, Groundhog Day (1993); with a pinch of stoner element, a dash of crime mystery and a spoonful of subtle political undertones thrown into the mix. On top the that, the visually-stunning representation of a stoner's psychedelic journey and the sharp (witty) dialogues are also worth mentioning. Most of the actors and actresses in this film are acting heavyweights; so you don't have to worry about bad acting. Strong performances overall; especially by Jeff Bridges and John Goodman.\n\nWHAT I DISLIKE: I am not going to lie; this film does lack a little in the plot department; which was redeemed by the quirky humours and the strong performances by the cast. This film is meant to be a quirky, idiosyncratic comedy; instead of a highly-analytical crime thriller that many had hoped for. This film is laid with a complex theme; deceit ciminality and death; which were swiftly diffused by the situational comedies. How could you cry for someone when the next thing after his/her death was his/her ashes flying right onto your face?"

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie grabs me for so many reasons. First of all I really dig the way the dude handles things. He's just so damned lax about everything. Watching the dude go about his stuff is the perfect antidote for the hustle and bustle of today's overly-corporatised world.\n\nThe humour of this film is unique and enjoyable because of the strong characterisation of the film. Praise goes to Jeff Bridges for totally immersing himself into his role and really embracing it. The humour of the film can be very subtle at times, and as you watch it and learn more of the dude's habbits, it becomes even better. It's a very detailed film. Support cast was terrific, esp. John Goodman as the rambunctious Vietnam vet. Go see the movie and be amazed at the production, witty (yet unpretentious) dialogue, quirky characters and an amazing soundtrack to boot."

How, then, is it so entertaining?\n\nJeff Bridges holds the thing together like glue. He plays the unflappable Dude -- who gets flapped aplenty -- with such wit and grace that he pulls off plenty of schtick, making this cartoon utterly believable and convincing. (Oh ho! -- he writes checks for less than a dollar! He smokes a joint and says \"bummer\"! He lives to bowl and yet never rolls!) The Coens were dead right to cast Bridges; any actor who misstepped would have sunk the ship.\n\nEven still, a quarter or more of the scenes don't work, but what does is very entertaining, very funny. Probably as much foul language per frame as GOOD WILL HUNTING, but at least here it seems to make sense; the Coens don't cram it into everyone's mouths unilaterally."

The Coen brothers are incapable of making a boring film, and this was no exception. Whether it's a great film (Fargo, Blood Simple, No Country for Old Men, Miller's Crossing, to name a few) or merely a puzzling one (Barton Fink comes to mind), their films are inventive, interesting, and memorable. Lebowski is closer to Barton Fink than the great films. There were many wonderful scenes, lines, and performances. However, to me, the overall effect was less than the sum of the parts. Even putting aside the numerous plot holes (because this film was clearly not about its plot), I found myself waiting for some narrative thread or theme to tie together the nearly random eccentric scenes. I left feeling the movie was strange, interesting, but ultimately unsatisfying. It wasn't a waste of my time, mind you, but no way should it be ranked as high as it is."

This was way too boring and pointless movie to me and it got 8.2 rating? :) Are you kidding me? I think even 3 stars are higher for this boring, jarring, pointless, stupid, silly, worthless, waste-of-time, mind-sucking movie. From the first scene to last scene, I have watched it and thought now there would be something now there would be something but no, at the end, credits started rolling and I simply threw the movie out of my collection.

Almost every line of the script is pure gold and if it does not bring the merest chuckle out of you then you are rolling around on the floor in fits of laughter.\n\nObviously the 'Dude' is a legendary creation, played to perfection by Bridges, but just outshining him is Goodman as Walter. He is quite possibly the funniest character to be portrayed on screen. You only have to go to the memorable quotes tab on the column to the left to experience just how funny this guy is. His constant bringing up of the Vietnam war into literally any topic of conversation never ceases to be funny and the scene he smashes up that blokes car shouting 'You see what happens when you f*** a stranger in the ass!' is the best of all the classic scenes that make up this masterpiece.\n\nThis is the one film I don't think I will ever get tired of watching. And if for some bizarre reason you don't like it, check your pulse you may very well not be alive."

The experience with \"The Big Lebowski\" was more or less the same. Fortunately, I watched it a second time before I returned the DVD and... my life changed. I immediately started building my own personal Coen brothers' collection (starting with, of course, The Big Lebowski). I have easily seen this movie more than a hundred times by now. In fact, I can replay the entire movie in my head if I need to!\n\nSome general suggestions for Coen newcomers: You have to allow yourself to be transported into the \"Coens' World\" before you can fully appreciate their movies. The guys have a quirky worldview and a rather twisted sense of humour. They also have a gift for writing fast, funny, quotable dialogue.\n\nTransporting one's self to the Coens' world isn't very hard: this can be accomplished by watching, for example, The Big Lebowski about 2-3 times (say within ten days).\n\nWhat you will get out of this movie: Several memorable quotes which will be a source of endless amusement throughout your life. And, if you watch it often enough, you'll also end up leading a more \"relaxed\" and enjoyable life. A word of warning: Don't overdo it! Overexposure may well diminish your enjoyment of the movie. (I'd say that 20 is a safe enough number of times that you can watch this movie. And then maybe you can continue to watch once or twice a year for pretty much the rest of your life.))\n\nEverything I wish to say about this movie has already been said and been said better. (If you're already an \"achiever\", do read other users' comments, they are great!) If you were waiting for one more recommendation before you rent it, here it is: Watch it! (Hopefully you'll like it as much as I did.)"

She is subsequently kidnapped and the big Lebowski assigns The Dude the task of being the bag man in return for a load of money. The mission is screwed up, however, when The Dude's friend Walter joins in and messes things up. This leaves The Dude in a shaky position where he has to attempt to reclaim the money.\n\nThis is a defiantly pointless film. It's a crime-comedy with very little emphasis on realism. It's played for laughs pure and simple. It benefits from an impressive cast. Jeff Bridges is good in the lead role, with some funny support performances from John Turturro as a sleazy bowler and Philip Seymour-Hoffman as the big Lebowski's personal assistant. Although I found John Goodman a little overbearing and annoying to tell you the truth. It's a highly stylised film, which you would probably expect coming from the Coen brothers. It isn't always as funny as it thinks it is though, although there are admittedly a number of very funny moments. It was nice to hear some good sounds in this one though. In particular a couple of ultra-cool laid back tunes from early 70's Italian movies, namely Piacere Sequence by Teo Usuelli (taken from the giallo 'Amuck') and Traffic Boom by Piero Piccioni (taken from the comedy 'All Screwed Up') - the latter of which was the soundtrack to the film within a film here.\n\nIts story-line is very unfocused, maybe that's the point I suppose but it certainly means that in order to enjoy the film you need to be able to overlook this. It's surely no coincidence that lots of people say they weren't too keen on this film the first time they saw it and it took subsequent viewings to appreciate. I myself am pretty much the same and this no doubt explains its lukewarm performance at the box office and then it's slow-burning success on home video. Having said all this, despite being an entertaining film, I still find it kind of hard to understand the real appeal of this movie. An amusing enough flick for sure but not a grade A Coen movie in my opinion."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Big Lebowski\" is a hilarious movie. It makes you laugh scene after a scene and that makes it a fine piece of quality comedy. It has a rather bizarre story which sometimes gets a bit silly, but it's still enjoyable all the way through. The story tells about a man named Jeffrey \"The Dude\" Lebowski. He is accidentally mistaken for a millionaire Jeffrey Lebowski and this leads him to things he wouldn't want to have experienced. With his bowling buddy Walter's help he tries to get things right but is constantly failed in his tasks, mainly because of Walter's strange personality and anger issues.\n\nThe best thing about this film is the characters and the role performances done by the actors. The characters are just great, they're vivid and they all have odd personalities and different ways of interacting. Jeff Bridges plays the character of \"The Dude\", a total looser who would have preferred bowling instead the things he accidentally mixes up with. Bridges is so real in the role, though the character itself is so surreal, sort of an ignoring person who pretty much defines stupidity. Although Bridges is superb in the role I thought John Goodman was more entertaining in the role of Walter Sobchak. The character of Walter is just so bizarre. He is a Vietnam veteran who constantly deals with his anger issues and thinks he's right when it comes to solving things, yet being pretty much wrong in every case. Trying to help \"The Dude\" he just makes things worse and doesn't even admit that he's been wrong. I've never really found John Goodman as entertaining as in this movie, so thumbs up for that. There are also other characters worth mentioning; The always enjoyable Steve Buscemi as Theodore Donald 'Donny' Kerabatsos who never seems to be able to speak up his mind as he is always bothered by Walter. Being a bowling buddy of \"The Dude\" and Walter he still remains as one member of the group and there is some sympathy showed towards him in the end. Julianna Moore is also in a so surreal role, the role of Maude Lebowski who is obsessed with sex, the British daughter of the real millionaire Lebowski. We also see for example Philip Seymor Hoffman and Peter Stormare in one of the roles.\n\nThe screenplay's very well written, written by Ethan and Joel Cohen it definitely mixes up everything from the beginning till the end. This what also makes the plot a bit confusing at parts. You really need concentration, as there is constantly this fast dialog between the characters and it's just impossible to know what is important for the plot and what is not. There is just so much fillings in the dialogs that it gets a bit messy. The directing pretty much does the same, directed by Joel Cohen. It can be described from what I described the plot and the dialogs. Being precise, entertaining and swift it also blends up with the story so well, making the whole movie this one big entity where the main theme is never lost. Although it does get a bit confusing it's still that definite quality and you just can't go wrong with that.\n\n\"The Big Lebowski\" is a good movie, it's nothing phenomenal but it's definitely something worth watching if you don't want to watch something that serious, as it just does include these irrelevant and silly, yet hilarious parts which in their way are simply one crucial part of the movie. You will laugh, if not because of the great jokes or the dialog, then the odd silliness it has inside it. Great characters, superb role performances, a plot that evolves to something you couldn't have imagined and a guaranteed laugh-packed ride. \"The Big Lebowski\" does what it needs to, it doesn't have to exceed that."

The Dude, Walter and Donny are nicely three sides of a coin, the lazy no good bum, the overly strict and cranky hot-head, and the cowering coward ready to run from anything that shows the slightest sign of danger. The acting overall is quite nice. Jeff Bridges proves his acting prowess in role here as the lazy bum. John Goodman really inserts the crazy comedies from his lines and character role. Having Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare really adds very nicely, while Julianne Moore and Philip Seymour Hoffman complete the angles needed for the story."

This is no dud, but a man of intrepid action, ably supported by the Alley Irregulars, a couple of great-hearted associates who help him solve the mysteries at the centre of the epic, and who bravely face up to a gang of demented blackmailers and foul extortionists. There are many twists and turns and surprises along the way. What was the significance of the phantom kidnapping? How did the Hollywood big-shot producer get involved? Why did the Police Chief put his hat on before throwing a right hook? Why was the central piece de resistance of the tastefully furnished, state-of-the-art apartment micturated upon?\n\nThe acting throughout this gripping tale is stellar, the dialogue is courteous and refined, but unfailingly witty. There are a number of Dali-esque dream sequences, possibly owing something to Busby Hitchcock in one of his more surreal moods. Two animals, a marmot and a Pomeranian, play significant roles as the enigma unravels. Several forensic crime investigators are called in. There is also a sagacious Western narrator, acting as a sort of Greek chorus, lucidly explaining the intricacies of the background to the interplay of the characters.\n\nMake sure you see this masterpiece before you die."

It is not FARGO - it is a comedy with a great deal of surrealism. There are no higher moral issues and no lessons to be learned (besides: never spread the earthly remains (ashes) of your friend against the wind!).\n\nThe three main characters are all great. John Goodman is perfectly cast as the \"can't-get-over-it Vietnam vet\" Walther and the scene where he jumps out of a speeding car with a Uzi in order to pursue the kidnappers is slapstick at its best.\n\nThe best scenes though are the ones with The Dude, Walther and Donny arguing what to do with The Dudes personal problems. It cannot get any better.\n\nIf you haven't laughed long and loud during this movie I will suggest brain surgery in order to find the lost sense of humour.\n\nRating: 9 of 10."

But sadly they occur only every half an hour or so.\n\nIn summary this movie is quite overrated, maby for people who like this kind of senseless movies. But thats nothing for me."

The humor is subtle and in my opinion barely existant. John Goodman was the main reason I continued to watch the film as he offered a character whose unpredictability sparked some interest in a almost uninteresting plot.\n\nIts not a bad film, it just never seems to go anywhere or offer anything. I'd recommend to watch it if you have the chance with nothing better to do, just for the sake of seeing a movie that isn't trash. However at the same time, don't expect a masterpiece of cinema or a great film.\n\nThe movie isn't funny for the most part, but I guess that depends on what makes you laugh. In the end though, its safe to say I won't be watching this movie again."

A bearded, unemployed, pot-smoking holdover from the '60s becomes entangled in corruption after he's hired to be the ransom-courier in a kidnapping. As the Dude, Jeff Bridges gives his all to this loose, shaggy character; the Dude is not just a textbook hipster, slacker or fish out of water, he's a laid-back guy cartoonishly naive of the craziness inherent in this new generation's loss of morals, and he's so generally good-hearted that he's blindsided by violence and craven villainy. The Coens nearly outdo themselves in creating eccentric, mercurial characters, cutting twisty corners with an irony that isn't condescending or too obvious, and their cinematic conception of this material is often dazzling. *** from ****"

        "review_detailed_main": "If you are watching this movie and think it's a bowling movie, you're watching it wrong. If you're watching this movie and think it's a stoner movie, you're still watching it wrong. If you're watching this movie thinking it's about a mystery movie, a whodunit movie, or a mistaken identity movie, you're STILL watching it wrong.....because \"we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski...\" Yeah, this movie is on a completely different category. I mean, I can't even describe it. What I DO know is that this movie is supposed to be funny and it's a completely different type of comedy.\n\nLet me explain what I'm trying to say. Everybody knows about movies that are \"So bad It's Good\", like the movie The Room, for example. I mean, if you watch the movie The Room thinking it's supposed to be a drama movie, or a suspenseful movie, or a \"dark comedy\" movie, then you are watching it wrong. You don't watch that movie for its love story, you watch that movie because it's so bad it's good. You watch movies like that because you want to make fun of it. Now let's get back to The Big Lebowski. It's not a \"So Bad It's Good\" category.....FAR from it. While you watch The Room to make fun of it, The Big Lebowski is a movie that makes fun of you!\n\nSo what does that mean, the movie makes fun of me? Yes, it's teasing you, it's making you think it's a bowling movie, but it's really not. You don't even see the main character play a single game! This movie is making you think it's a mystery movie, but it's really not! There is NO mystery! That's what makes this movie hilarious. That's the reason this movie barely makes any sense......because it's NOT supposed to make sense in the first place! It's the ultimate anti-joke. It's a plot that makes fun of plots, a comedy that makes fun of comedy, a punchline without a punchline.\n\nWhat so genius about this movie is that it's NOT self-aware. It's a comedy that doesn't hold your hand, it's like you either get it or you don't. If you don't get it, then it's WORKING, because you're not supposed to get it! Throughout the whole movie, every time you see the 3 main characters together, you'll notice The Dude has all the questions, Walter thinks he has all the answers, and poor Donny walks in and is still figuring out what the question is! If this is your first time watching this movie, you are like Donny. If it's your second time watching this movie, you are like The Dude. If it's your third time watching this movie, you become like Walter, because now you \"think\" you know all the answers...\n\nSo in conclusion, this movie is nothing like all the other comedy movies such as The Hangover, or Superbad, or even The Room. It's a totally different type of comedy, and it grows with you the more you watch it. That's the reason why people tell you that you have to watch it again, because, yes, you are watching it wrong.....and when you realize this movie is intentionally trying to not make sense, then it becomes hilarious every single time you watch it.....and it's SO quotable."

Another is a rich businessman with a wayward trophy wife and who lives in a mansion. Witless debt collectors mistake one for the other and start a chain of funny, off-beat and intriguing events.\n\nThe Coen Brothers are simply not capable of making a bad movie, they couldn't do so even if they tried. They are masters of taking things just far enough to be strange and off-beat and yet not let it all fall apart completely. Something that David Lynch should learn from. Even if you are not taken by the plot they throw so many extras at you that you can just enjoy the productions for those alone.\n\nThis is something of crossbreed movie. Indeed it takes from Raymond Chandler to the Odd Couple stopping off at Pulp Fiction. Star turn is not Jeff Bridges (hippie Lebowski), but his bowling buddy John Goodman who puts in an amazing performance as a damaged and deranged Vietnam vet and some of his lines are laugh out loud funny - especially how he deals with a fellow bowler who has \"stepped over the line.\" A little scene that stands up to the best of the funny business in Pulp Fiction.\n\nMaybe if you want to be harsh they do turn this in to a bit of a variety show that goes from the bowling alley small-talk, to surreal dreams scenes, to the tale of a how a pair of dimwits try to dig themselves out of a hole. Four letter words come thick and fast and you wonder whether we really need them. This is - after all - a silly comedy. Why cut off part of the audience? Equally why is Roger (the dim one) only called The Dude throughout and never by his first name?\n\nGood entertainment and sure to become a cult - if it is not already."

It has a typical film noir story arc mixed with a couple of stoner characters and a hip setting in the early 1990s Los Angeles that creates a great atmosphere to watch the action unfold. This is Raymond Chandler on vacation; relaxed and willing to stretch out and let loose.\n\nWhen it first premiered, this was quite a misunderstood movie. People couldn't believe that this was written, produced and directed by the same team who made that brilliant crime thriller Fargo from two years before. Yet, this kind of movie shows how creative and daring the Coen brothers are. They don't try to make just one kind of film; they branch out and try different ideas until they hit upon one that works. And they had to know from the start that a character like the Dude would work. With the wonderfully laid back Jeff Bridges in the title role, the Dude abides as one of the greatest of all movie characters, perhaps the Coens have ever written and one that will be remembered for ages.\n\nOf course, where would the Dude be without his able partner, Walter Sobchak, that Vietnam-crazy, screaming Jew who takes his bowling almost as serious as his religion. John Goodman gives perhaps his most memorable performance and it is a great one; thoroughly entertaining as well as very funny. And then there is Donny, played with sweet naivet\u00e9 by Steve Buscemi. Donny doesn't do or say much, but I think he represents the audience; just there for the ride and seeing the story unfold only because he enjoys the company of the Dude and Walter despite his constant yelling at him.\n\nThis is a movie that could be discussed and analyzed forever in terms of its plot, dream sequences and ways it adheres to old-fashion storytelling with modern film making. But perhaps the Coens simply wanted it enjoyed on its most basic level; as the story of a man called Dude who had his rug peed on and sought destitute for it. And that is because that rug really tied the room together. This is a completely original and unforgettable movie that must be seen by any Coen brothers or modern movie fan."

        "review_detailed_main": "I had seen this movie once before and got way more out of it when watching it recently for the second time.\n\nI think the complexity of dialogue is one of this movie's most fantastic aspects. Ironically though, I think it's also the reason I didn't like the film as much from my first viewing. I think this is also where the movie's rewatchability comes from. The dialogue is written in an extremely non-linear fashion. Often much of it has to be filtered through to follow the plot, as there can be so much going on in a scene. Upon my rewatch I was able to better follow and inspect what was going on in the more dialogue heavy scenes and when you're no longer struggling to just follow the plot, you can really appreciate the intricacies the Cohen brothers wrote into these conversations.\n\nI found the chaos of these dialogue scenes very humorous and you really get to see the dynamic of the Dude's friend group through these scenes. It's hilarious watching everyone talking to each other, yet so caught up in their own heads at the same time.\n\nThe story and wildness of the tale is captivating and the wacky premise with which it starts draws you in quickly, especially with the way the Dude and his pals respond and react to the events that befall them.\n\nJulianne Moore's role in the film is one of my favorite and in my opinion most mastered storylines of the movie. Her introduction is particularly memorable and impressed into my brain.\n\nThe narration in this movie fits well throughout and towards the end became one of my favorite parts of the film. It brings a whole new path to reflect about the movie on and does a phenomenal job at wrapping the narrative in a meaningful and expansive way that adds to the movie at the same time as it encapsulates it.\n\nThe dream sequences provide nice intermissions to the story and are also hilarious as well as visually a joy to watch.\n\nMy biggest complaint about the film has to be the potential for it to cause confusion in its complexity, but this is also what makes the movie so great and makes it worth watching again. I look forward to the next time I see this movie and anticipate my third viewing to be even more enjoyable than my last!"

He's always careless and takes nothing to his heart. You can't just use regular swear words like scumbag, punk or pathetic loser on him because the dude takes them to a whole new level in every respect. The dude is such a shameless person, that his story and style can remind me of people's stereotyped, dull and ignorant behaviors. If you identify with the dude's personality, this movie will make you think about whether you're reacting too aggressively and emotionally at times, that at the most of these times, you don't have to give a dam about things. There's always more reasons to stay calm and happy than being angry about people and stuffs."

        "review_detailed_main": "There is a youtube.com video somebody laboriously strung together of all the numerous eff-words in this movie and the order in which they appear. The thing goes on for at least two full minutes. And it is very, very funny. Trouble is, the entire movie is little more amusing than this little clip. Only it lasts much longer. Too long, in fact. For years I had put off watching The Big Lebowski. After seeing various snippets of it, I began to develop suspicions that the entire ordeal might not be worth the time to watch it. Unfortunately, my suspicions were confirmed after a recent viewing of the whole thing.\n\nThe story, and I use the word \"story\" loosely, deals with an ex-hippie loser trying to get revenge and restitution from those who urinated on a rug in his tiny apartment. A case of mistaken identity causes Jeff Lebowski to be assaulted by goons in an early scene, and his home and possessions violated. Lebowski, played wonderfully by Jeff Bridges, has been mistaken for a seemingly wealthy man and he feels that the real target of the assault at least owes him for the rug. Lebowski goes to the man's mansion to ask for restitution, but ends up getting involved in a kidnapping scheme involving the man's trophy wife. Nothing else must be said about the plot. You just have to sit back an experience the rest. My guess is that many people, whether they will admit it or not, may find this movie a tad bit tedious. Yes, it is full of talented and funny actors, and yes it was made by the Coen brothers. But the plot involving nihilists, hit men, eccentric performance artists, bowling alleys, and god knows whatever else is just too much to take in one dosage. My guess is the Coens were just bound and determined to tell some kind of story about \"The Dude\", and the plot of that story was ultimately inconsequential to the actual act of telling his story.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Bridges is pretty funny as \"The Dude\" Jeff Lebowski. This is one of those roles an actor doesn't have to do a lot for. No trips to the gym, no chiseled abs like in Against All Odds. Heck, he even used some of his own clothes. The rest of the cast is pretty good, too. They just aren't always sure how best to use them. If anyone out there doesn't know who John Millius is, trust me... John Goodman nailed him. Tara Reid ten years later seems like a casting mistake though. Back then I guess someone thought she had talent.\n\nThe Coens are living gods in the minds of many. For my money, they are pretty hit and miss. They've given us duds like O Brother Where Art Thou, and the Ladykillers. Little gems like Raising Arizona. Stellar efforts like Fargo. And maybe the best film I've ever seen, No Country for Old Men. But The Big Lebowski is a slight miss for them. If you like it, then I guess The Hound abides but can only give it 6 of 10 stars himself."

The same thing happens when I come across people who think they are very intellectual and make meaningless movies about gender, social problems and politics, even though they have nothing clever to say. And it's like I'm the Dude character who can't understand what's wrong with them."

        "review_detailed_main": "I enjoyed many parts of the movie - quite a lot, in fact. Jeff Bridges as the laid back \"luzer\" dude was brilliant. John Goodman, a 'Nam Vet', more than did his character justice. Some of the situations were really funny and made sense. Some made no sense and were funny. Other situations just made no sense. As a whole piece, it's a really flawed movie.\n\nMost of the situations revolved around the whereabouts of $1 million in ransom money. The ingenious plot twists usually hang together, but not always. What was the point of the volkswagon dectective? What did that contribute? Nothing - it was just another point of confusion. The nihilist gang (which at least provided some funny dialogs) never fit with the rest of the movie, which was irritating. The cowboy narrator never fit, either; although I found his folksy drawl to be comforting.\n\nThis movie does a seriously poor job with it's female characters. The male lead characters are well developed, and most of the male secondary characters are well drawn also. The women characters are all flat and bizarre - more like creatures from outer space than real people. The millionaire's \"trophey wife\", Bunny, is a dumb blond ho. The adult daughter Maude comes off as mechanical and inhuman.\n\nSo, we have flashes of brilliance interspersed with a fair amount of gimcrack movie making. There is no ending, to speak of - the story just stops for no reason. Many situations set up earlier are left dangling and unresolved. In fact, the whole thing about what happens to the missing million dollars is just forgotten.\n\nI think most people will find something to laugh at and something to like when they watch this movie. But, it's really not a satisfying movie experience."

        "review_detailed_main": "John Goodman and Jeff Bridges are an absolutely fantastic duo in The Big Lebowski. However, I want to talk about the direction of the Coens' for this film. The writing also reminded me of Thomas Pynchon's Inherent Vice a decent amount, and I definitely mean that as a positive.\n\nHowever, the Coen brothers' direction is for me what brings the other components of the film together. The film's weird psychedelic scenes, the slow motion bowling with John Turturro, and the wonderful use of space, particularly with the houses of the two Lebowskis, all add comedic, eccentric depth to an otherwise still funny movie. The trip The Dude takes when he lays down on his floor on his rug and starts flying is one of the psychedelic scenes that comes to mind. it feels so odd, but in another way, entirely right. John Turturro's (Jesus Quintana) character does not have much to him other than the beautiful slow motion bowling scene, but man is that enough. Finally, I got to thinking about the disparity of space between the two Lebowski places. The Dude's place is relatively small, but it's there that we go on a trip (and Treehorn's place, but that's for another time) that opens up to the whole city. Whereas when we are at The Big Lebowski's place, The Dude, Brandt, Bunny, and almost anyone who enters looks small in comparison to the space of the house. It's an interesting dichotomy that truthfully may not mean much, but it's something small (I guess pun intended) that makes the direction of the movie more special. It's also just a legitimately very funny movie that really does thrive off the duo of Goodman and Bridges. It's weird and it's frequently nonsensical, but it's still worth a watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Big Lebowski is a hilarious, quirky movie from start to finish. For years, my parents have owned it on DVD, but it wasn't until around 2016 or 2017, that they finally allowed me and my old brother to watch it. And ever since then, it's been a favorite of both of ours. In fact, we went together to see it as part of a special summer event at a local movie theater, and we never get tired of it!\n\nSet in 1991 Los Angeles, the movie centers on unemployed slacker Jeffrey \"The Dude\" Lebowski (played by Jeff Bridges), who, like me, loves bowling. One night, a pair of thugs, mistaking him for shady millionaire Jeffrey \"The Big\" Lebowski (David Huddleston), whose much younger trophy wife Bunny (Tara Reid), owes money all over town, invade The Dude's home, assault him, and do number one on his cherished rug. Wanting compensation for his rug, The Dude approaches the other Lebowski, who has a job offer for him; Bunny has been kidnapped, and he needs a good bagman. However, when The Dude's overzealous and hotheaded bowling buddy, Vietnam veteran Walter Sobchak (John Goodman), wanting to keep the ransom money for himself and The Dude, fakes the ransom drop, and to make matters worse, The Dude ends up losing the briefcase soon after, things fall apart very quickly.\n\nThe acting in this movie is tremendous. Jeff Bridges is fabulous as The Dude. John Goodman, as usual, is a pure delight as Walter. Steve Buscemi is great as The Dude and Walter's dimwitted bowling buddy, Donny Kerabatsos. Julianne Moore is flawlessly refined as The Big Lebowski's daughter, Maude Lebowski. David Huddleston (may he rest in peace) makes a great villain as The Big Lebowski. Tara Reid is fittingly sultry as Bunny. Philip Seymour Hoffman (may he also rest in peace) is great as Brandt, The Big Lebowski's right-hand man. Even John Turturro is a treasure as rival bowler Jesus Quintana, even if he only gets two scenes. Everybody else is great in their roles. And yeah, I know this seems like a lot of characters, but almost all of them contribute to the plot in some way.\n\nThe Big Lebowski is also filmed fantastically, and not only shows off how beautiful Los Angeles looks, it even gives us a good look at the bowling alley's pinsetter. It also boasts some great special effects, especially in the dreams that The Dude has when he's knocked out on two occasions.\n\nThe writing is just terrific. The whole movie is essentially a shaggy dog story, that revolves around The Dude being abused and blamed for stuff that he can't control, because he simply manages to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and constantly gets tangled in conflicting information between certain parties. And yet it all works, and is spun into a truly hilarious experience. The best part is that it doesn't rely on slapstick, gags or punchlines for its comedy. It's all just sharp, intelligent fun.\n\nAnd lastly, we have the music. Interestingly, this movie doesn't rely on an instrumental score. In fact, only two special cues were composed by Coen Brothers regular Carter Burwell. The rest of the time, the movie relies on mostly pre-existing songs cleverly chosen by the fantastic T-Bone Burnett, including \"Just Dropped In\" by Kenny Rogers, \"Lookin' Out My Back Door\" by Creedence, and especially sharp use of \"Peaceful Easy Feeling\" by the Eagles. It should also be worth noting that the movie also uses two versions of the song \"Viva Las Vegas\"; a soft ballad version by Shawn Colvin in the end credits, and in the movie itself, a rock version jokingly credited to \"Big Johnson\" (my theory is that it was by T-Bone Burnett himself).\n\nEverything considered, The Big Lebowski is a quirky, clever and hilarious movie, and easily the best the Coen Brothers have ever created. Watch this movie, and whether you like it or not, which I guarantee you will, The Dude abides!!!!\n\nOh, and one more thing... \"MARK IT ZERO!!!!!!!!!\""

It's one of those movies that makes you want to grab a bottle and a ball and have yourself a good time. It's what Donnie would've wanted. At least, we think so.

And it's not that I don't like weird movies; but 'The Big Lebowski' (in defiance of its hero's philosophy) seems to try just a little too hard."

At the point The Dude begins to seek the rug he is rejecting Gods order, and thus, becomes Lebowski. Lebowski is cast out of Eden, by God, into the Land of Nod, where he wanders encountering lies, violence, treachery and deceit.\n\nAt the end, Lebowski has learned his lesson and regains Gods favor. He says, directly to God, \"The Dude abides\" and God repeats it to the audience."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Big Lebowski,\" a film directed by the Coen Brothers, is a cinematic masterpiece that defies easy categorization. It skillfully weaves together elements of comedy, drama, and noir, creating a unique and brilliant concoction.\n\nThe film's plot, while seemingly intricate, is a tour de force of absurdity. Jeff Bridges' portrayal of \"The Dude,\" a laid-back, White Russian-loving bowling enthusiast, is nothing short of iconic. The narrative follows The Dude as he finds himself mistaken for a millionaire named Lebowski, leading him into a tangled web of kidnapping, mistaken identity, and existential musings. The Coen Brothers' knack for crafting intricate plots with a veneer of chaos is evident throughout the film, but it's the journey, not the destination, that truly captivates the audience.\n\nThe ensemble cast is where \"The Big Lebowski\" truly shines. John Goodman's Walter Sobchak is a tour de force of over-the-top machismo and misplaced loyalty, providing both comic relief and a touch of pathos. Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, among others, bring their A-game, each adding layers of depth and humor to what could have been mere caricatures.\n\nBeneath its comedic exterior, \"The Big Lebowski\" delves into profound themes of identity, nihilism, and the American Dream. However, the Coen Brothers manage to critique society's obsessions and failures with a light touch, making the film both entertaining and thought-provoking. The visual style, with its 90s aesthetic and the dreamy, almost ethereal quality of certain scenes, complements the film's thematic depth.\n\nThe music and atmosphere further enhance the film's impact. Carter Burwell's score, combined with an eclectic soundtrack that ranges from Bob Dylan to Kenny Rogers, creates an atmosphere that's both nostalgic and vibrant. The bowling alley scenes, in particular, become a character of their own, pulsating with life and providing a backdrop that's both mundane and profoundly symbolic.\n\nCriticisms: Some viewers might not appreciate the film's unconventional pace or its meandering narrative, which sometimes feels more like a collection of loosely connected stories rather than a tightly woven plot. The film requires a high tolerance for the absurd, which may not appeal to those seeking conventional storytelling or straightforward comedy.\n\nConclusion: \"The Big Lebowski\" is not just a movie; it's an experience. It invites multiple viewings, revealing new layers of humor and meaning each time. For those who connect with its offbeat humor and philosophical undertones, it's a near-perfect slice of cinema. However, for others, it might be an acquired taste. Nevertheless, for those who \"get it,\" The Dude remains one of the most memorable characters in modern cinema, making \"The Big Lebowski\" a quirky yet profound odyssey worth watching."

I will admit that the film can be a bit scattered at times, but in the end everything just links up to form a comedic masterpiece.\n\nThe film's plot is simple: Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) otherwise known as the Dude, is an LA deadbeat who one day is mistaken for a wealthy figure with the same name by two hoods. They wreck his home and urinate on his rug, and seeking revenge Jeff becomes embroiled in a shady kidnapping situation involving the other Lebowski.\n\nStarring Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi and a number of other notable actors like John Turturro and Seymour Hoffman, there is no lack of excellent acting. Goodman portrays Walter Sobchak, a foul-mouthed, quick-tempered, but utterly hilarious Vietnam vet who is part of the Dude's bowling team. Buscemi is Donny, the neglected third member of the team who is treated like crap by Walter. Turturro and Hoffman are a flamboyant bowler named Jesus and the other Lebowski's assistant respectively. They all fit into their characters perfectly.\n\nI'm not as affected by profanity as some others may be, so I didn't have a problem with the dialogue, which can be pretty filthy at times but still funny. The film isn't for everyone, but everyone needs to see this comedic gem at least once..."

By the end, we are satisfied and we basically learn that people who bowl in bowling alleys, sleep in low-rent apartments and drink White Russians all day are people too. And sometimes they are better than the wealthy and the elite.\n\nOnly problem is, if you didn't already know that, what you need to do is drop out of college, stop having mommy and daddy pay your bills and join the real world.

The other man's wife apparently has a lot of outstanding debts and the ruffians who pay Jeff a visit urinate on his rug before he finally convinces them he's NOT the rich husband they're looking for. He's simply a bum known by everyone as \"the dude\". The dude decides that if he simply visits the rich guy with the same name, he can probably talk him into replacing his rug, since technically they were supposed to have urinated on the rich guy's rug instead. The rich fellow, however, tells the dude that his wife's been kidnapped and asks the dude to carry the ransom money to them.\n\nWhy? Good question... and from there, the story gets even more confusing and pointless. Which, the filmmakers freely admit. On the DVD version, the filmmakers frankly state that the confusing plot takes a back seat to the quirky characters we get to meet. Oh joy.\n\nThey even admit that when one of the actors asked what his character's motivation was, or why he was even in the story - they didn't have an answer for him. They say this laughing (at the viewers?).\n\nAnyways... the only positive thing I can say about this movie is that the visuals and transitions are unique and creative, and that Jeff Bridges proves again that he's such a good actor he can even come out shining when buried under a pile of feces. His portrayal of the dude is priceless - and he doesn't dance half-bad either."

True it does seem to go all over the place, but in the end there are no loose ends that are left untied. An achievement that you don't see much in the mainstream due to the fact that they hope to make a sequel.\n\nAfter watching and laughing within the first five minutes of the film, I had to pause it every now and then to control myself before continuing. There's so much in this film to love that it is no surprise that film has gained a cult following. What I personally love about this film is how the Coens picked actors that actually looked like someone that you would find walking down the street or inhabiting the suburbs of America. Jeff Bridges just nails his famous role as \"The Dude\" and is part of the reason I think people like this film. The entire film is pretty much about an average guy thrust into this random stream of events and he's still trying to figure out what the hell is going on.\n\nIf you haven't seen it, watch it. Now."

This film is a perfect demonstration of the comedic genius the Coen Brothers have; they are masterful at creating dialogue that is not only humorous, but also very memorable (\"The dude abides\", \"Obviously, you're not a golfer\").\n\nThe memorability of the dialogue in this movie is also due in large part to the performances of the stellar cast. Jeff Bridges was absolutely made to play the laid-back Dude, and to replace him with any one else would be a disservice and a travesty. John Goodman also knocks it out of the park as the gruff Walter and I found his performance to be just as memorable, if not, even more so than Jeff's. I could genuinely not imagine anyone else playing these two characters because of how much they embody them.\n\nEvery scene in this movie is like its own comedy vignette, which makes it very rewatchable. The crime-related main story of the movie takes a back seat to the various strange and comical encounters and exchanges that the Dude happens upon throughout, so if you're watching this movie hoping to have a complex narrative about blackmail, fingerprints, and what not, you might be disappointed. Nonetheless, I feel like the crime aspect taking a back seat was a good choice for what the Coens set out to do in trying and gave the film less of a ball-and-chain to drag around.\n\nIf you're looking for a comedy you can watch your friends on the weekend, you might skip the Hangover and choose this comedy classic instead."

Bad pub made me stay away from Lebowski on its theatrical release, and am just now getting around to it. What a gem! Truly brilliant casting and the Coen's now customary bizarre dialog make this one something special. Who, but the Coens, would cast Steve Buscemi as a former surfer or Flea (Red Hot Chili Peppers) as a nihilist? Yes, we expect perfection from Jeff Bridges every time - here he delivers. Is he a slacker or just a decent guy who doesn't wish his rug soiled? Bridges perfectly captures the spirit of the dude. Goodman is his usual over-the-top self, only moreso. His dialog seems at time pulled straight from \"Casino\", if you f** know what I f** mean. The beautiful Julianne Moore seems a bit disinterested in her role until her wonderful scene for improving conception. Philip Seymour Hoffman again shows why he is absolutely the best young character actor working today. Tara Reid (\"Cruel Intentions\" and \"American Pie\") has a brief yet effective role as teh trophy wife with confusing intentions. David Huddleston steals his scenes for the first time since \"Blazing Saddles\" and Coen regular, John Turturro is terrifically offbeat as Jesus the wonder bowler. Sam Elliot lends a touch of class as the stranger, and don't miss Aimee Mann ('til Tuesday) and Ben Gazarra. Another aspect that we have come to expect in Coen movies is a wonderful soundtrack. Lebowski provides us with Dylan and Costello along with the wonderful work of Carter Burwell. This movie begs for repeat viewings, but do brace yourself for the boundary pushing."

However when it was all over you stopped to reflect on the movie that you just saw and realized you had no idea what you just saw? This movie is the story of Jeffrey Lebowski and his run in with Jeffrey Lebowski (The big Lebowski). In a variety of plot twists and turns with fake kidnappings and a pornographic producer looking for his payday, somehow unfolded in it all is a movie. Mostly considered to have darker films, the Cohen Brothers take a swing at humor. Even though they very much succeed, it all goes back to how much this movie makes no sense and goes nowhere. With their more serious movies they have first and second acts with conclusions and all. With The Big Lebowski things just sort of happen and then nothing at all. By watching the movie you get embraced into their world as if going on a vacation. You go there, and then you leave \u0096 you might have some fun, and some laughs, and you might not. Whether your experience is good or bad however, the discussions to follow the film will be anything but boring. Even if you didn't like the movie at all, the quotes you will be saying in the months to come will be ever lasting and unforgettable. And just like the film, what really happened in this review?"

        "review_title": "Obnoxious characters swamped in a story that is much too pretentious and complicated for its own good",
        "review_detailed_main": "Here are the highlights of \"The Big Lebowski.\" The opening scene with Jeff Bridges, as a never-do-well being comically ambushed by two men in his home, one of whom urinates on his living room rug. Mr. Bridges again, dropping a joint on his crotch while he's driving and careening into a trash can. Mr. Bridges yet again babbling absolute nonsense, trying to fake his way out of a jam. Mr. Bridges, yes he, being bonked in the head with a ceramic mug.\n\nYou would think that these moments, coupled with the fact that Mr. Bridges plays the lead, would make \"The Big Lebowski\" a deliriously funny comedy. But alas, it's just valiantly unsuccessful. For Mr. Bridges is far more interesting than the dopey character that's been written for him by his directors, the much-lauded Joel and Ethan Coen. And those highlights were predominantly jabs of slapstick: the only truly funny moments in the film, much more than the pseudo-insights of American culture and pornography. Another great moment, this one featuring John Goodman, has him bashing up a would-be perpetrator's car with a crowbar, only to have a neighbor (the real owner of the car) come screaming out of the house, taking the crowbar, and bashing in Mr. Bridges's car instead.\n\nIn other words, when the writer/directors go for simplistic and old-fashioned slapstick, coupled with their terrific wide-screen techniques and misc en scene, really works. It's the rest of their pretentious sense of humor that does not work. For once again, they have nose-dived into a pool of complexity, stretching out for something they don't quite have the understanding to reach. They have the ideas; what they lack is the patience to compose it in a way that not only communicates their ideas to the audience, but make it fascinating at the same time. For example, they add some pornographic subtext to the game of bowling (they might just be the only filmmakers to ever do that) but what exactly it means comes up very fuzzily. As is the show-stopping moment where Mr. Bridges goes into a drug-induced hallucination with him and Julianne Moore in an unnervingly peculiar bowling/sex extravaganza. What exactly, do I mean? I'm not sure, and I am not about to watch the film a second time, because it had me restless thirty minutes in.\n\nMr. Bridges does a nice enough job playing a character so sloppy and whiny that it borders on the ridiculous. And not in a good way. It's funny to have him cry out \"I'm the Dude!\" the first few times, but when it happens again and again for two hours, it really wears thin. As does John Goodman screaming at Steve Buscemi \"Shut the (expletive) up, Donny!\" Speaking of Mr. Goodman, he pours a lot of energy into his role, and I guess I cannot honestly say his performance is bad, but it became tiring seeing him on-camera after a while. The fault lies in the character, who is much too obnoxious and redundant to be funny. Mr. Buscemi gives a much more likable performance for a much more likable character, but is hardly on screen. How sad is that? Well, not his denouement.\n\nSurround these characters with a lumpy story far too complicated for its own good and you've got a dull picture. \"The Big Lebowski\" is clearly aiming to make commentaries of such, as demonstrated by Sam Elliott's out-of-the-blue appearances here and there in the picture, but they become lost in a pretentiously muddled screenplay.\n\nThe Coen brothers are good directors. They have great craftsmanship. A key moment is when the camera takes a bowling ball's point-of-view as it thunders down a lane. Slow-motion shots of the pins scattering, though gimmicky and seen before, are also fun to look at. So they can direct; they have talent! Immense talent. But they really do need to hire somebody to rework their screenplays, for that is where they fall short more often than not. Come the end of \"The Big Lebowski,\" I was not pondering over what Sam Elliott had just said in his closing speech, and what it had to do with all that happened in the two hours before, but instead, this.\n\nIn the scene where Mr. Bridges and Mr. Goodman are having a would-be sentimental moment by the ocean, who was that character I saw walking on the hill crest in the top-right section of the screen?"

        "review_detailed_main": "So there's this dude who lives in LA \u2013 wait \u2013 not \"this dude\", \"The Dude\"\u0085\n\nThe Dude (Jeff Bridges) is a bearded slob. His casual hippie-esque drawl is peppered with profanity and he calls almost everyone he meets, male or female: \"Man\". When \"dressed up\" he might wear a t-shirt and shorts, this is not often. Standard attire is an open robe and slippers.\n\nThe Dude hasn't worked for some time and he lives a simple, meagre existence in rented accommodation with few friends. His only non-negotiables are bowling and White Russians, an alcoholic beverage.\n\nThe Dudes only known friends are his bowling buddies, members of a league team, a league that they take extremely seriously. (There are many scenes in this film set in the bowling alley during play, however we only see one of the team ever bowl, three bowls from memory.) Speaking of the team, aside from The Dude we have Walter (John Goodman) and Donnie (Steve Buscemi).\n\nWalter is loud, opinionated and obnoxious, not exactly a winning combination, but he is loyal to The Dude and even though he frequently gets it wrong he seems to want to do the right thing. He treats Donnie with disdain and almost always brings everything back to a Nam story.\n\nDonnie is the opposite, simple, friendly and curious, he is always questioning and inserting randomly pointless comments into proceedings (\"I am the Walrus\").\n\nThe fun starts with a case of mistaken identity, a message made for a Lebowski is served to the wrong Lebowski being The Dude's AKA, this leads him in turn to the right Lebowski, specifically the Big Lebowski for a chat.\n\nThe chain of linked but totally unpredictable events that follows this simple mistake are realistically largely irrelevant to your enjoyment, aside from facilitating the introduction of various characters and providing The Dude and often Walter with a purpose for a short time. The convoluted plot is often broken up with insane yet totally entertaining dream sequences, generally bowling related and short sequences involving red herrings and bit characters, not the least of which is named The Jesus.\n\nHighlights though include:\n\n\n\nThe banter is often hilarious (and always profane), the ridiculous situations are often hard to follow but this never seems to matter anyway, and the cameos and brief go-nowhere scenes make the film even better (More highlights? \"Nobody f*cks wit De Jesus!\", The Dude's use of spy techniques at the home of the Pornographer brings hilarious results that are not what The Dude \u2013 or anyone would expect.)\n\nThough you will be relieved to know that come the conclusion of the film the bowling team does make it to the finals\u0085 or maybe that was a spoiler?\n\nFinal Rating \u2013 8 / 10. Never has a throwaway film been this indisposable. Apparently this is a \"Ya get it or ya don't\" film, I myself can't see why ya wouldn't wanna get it."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Big Lebowski is the 7th film written, produced and directed by the Coen Brothers. The script was written in the early '90s around the time they released Barton Fink. In the meantime, they wrote, produced and directed the box office bomb, The Hudsucker Proxy, as well as the critically acclaimed and Oscar award-winning, Fargo. They waited as long as they needed to get Jeff Bridges and John Goodman in the cast and it paid off big time.\n\nSimilar to The Big Sleep, The Big Lebowski takes a convoluted plot to extreme measures. Both films include a wealthy, handicapped millionaire, promiscuous young women, blackmailers and pornographers. Both films make us connect characters to one another and piece together a scattered plot.\n\nTaking a large step back from everything that happens in The Big Lebowski, the story is essentially about nothing. There is no money in the briefcase. There is no hostage. The nihilists believe in nothing except money. The Dude is not seen bowling. The Dude has no job and we don't know how he makes an income. Walter uses Shomer Shabbos as an excuse to do nothing on Saturday even though he's no longer Jewish. The only reason The Dude gets involved with Lebowski is due to his rug and agrees to work with him for just a small portion of the ransom. From the beginning, The Dude, Walter and Maude assume that Bunny kidnapped herself to extort money from Lebowski.\n\nThe bowling alley is the safe haven for The Dude and his team. Walter takes the bowling league very seriously. He threatens a bowler with a gun for stepping over the line and gets him to mark zero on his scorecard. When bowling rival Jesus Quintana (John Turturro) confronts the team, Walter reminds them he's a sex offender that exposed himself to an eight-year-old. Throughout the story, The Dude shares his news to Walter and Donny at the bowling alley. The mysterious man most likely overhears their conversations which is why he can narrate The Dude's story. He's seen talking to The Dude at the bowling alley's bar and appears again at the end. He never introduces himself, but Sam Elliot's resonant accent and thick mustache make his character memorable.\n\nThe script is very funny and explicit. The Dude and Walter's dialogue often clash but it doesn't get in the way of their friendship. The script was written specifically for Jeff Bridges and John Goodman's characters. Jeff Bridges is perfectly cast as The Dude, he's often misunderstood and spacing out in his own world. Unlike previous Coen Brothers films with Steve Buscemi, Donny can barely get a word out before Walter tells him to shut up. Julianne Moore puts on an interesting accent as Maude, that isn't distinct to any one place. Maude's giggly assistant, abstract artwork and sexual nature make her one of the funniest characters in the film. She's the centerpiece of the Gutterballs dream sequence as a sexy Viking surrounded by bowling pin dancers.\n\nThe soundtrack is great and it's referenced throughout the film. The Dude and Walter are listening to Creedence Clearwater Revival's \"Run Through the Jungle\" when delivering the briefcase. The cops who look for the car are worried the tape deck with Creedence would be stolen and are relieved when they find it still there. The song used in the opening credits, \"The Man in Me\" by Bob Dylan is used again when Maude knocks out The Dude and takes back the rug. They play the Rolling Stones song \"Dead Flowers\" by Townes Van Zandt after Donny's death.\n\nThe directing by Coen Brothers is very well done. Many of the cast members are reoccurring from previous films they've directed. The film's structure was influenced by detective fiction writer Raymond Chandler. The cinematography by Roger Deakins made the scenes look contemporary with the time period and the dream sequences to look bizarre. Deakins worked on previous Coen Brothers films such as Barton Fink and Fargo, as well as The Shawshank Redemption. The editing is impressive, especially during the dream sequences. The first-person camera shot inside the bowling ball as it rolls down the lane for a strike looks very sharp. They use pan and zoom shots frequently to go from a wide view of the setting to the subjects. They use long takes, the most impressive coming in the final scene, that finishes with a strike.\n\nAt the time, The Big Lebowski was one of the Coen Brothers highest budgeted films at $15 million. It grossed just over $46 million worldwide. The Big Lebowski can be enjoyed on many viewings and it succeeds as both a comedy and a crime film. I highly recommend this film to adults.\n\n4/4"

        "review_detailed_main": "If you see any \"greatest film lists\" or if your looking for top award winners, you will never find The Big Lebowski. Film critics will not praise it, as it doesn't really have any underlying message on life, love or the dangers of drugs or whatever. They would feel ashamed to admit that this is one of the best films ever. Fortunately, thanks to the regular film viewers on IMDb, The Big Lebowski gets the praise it so rightfully deserves, and a cemented place in the top #250.\n\nIt offers so many things. It has the usual brilliant Coen Bros script, with its twisting plot and humour. It has so many unusual and wonderful characters. It really is one of the funniest films ever. They could have easily taken the script and made it into a good thriller. But the Coens made it into so much more.\n\nThe characters are just brilliant. Jeff Bridges is great as \"The Dude\", who never fails to have a drink in his hand, and ends each sentence with \"man\". John Goodman puts in a terrific performance, as a Vietnam veteran who turns into a raving lunatic at the drop of a hat, but \"doesn't roll on Shabbah\". My favourite performance comes from Steve Buscemi, despite only having a relatively small part. He maintains a rather puzzled expression throughout, only to interrupt conversations at random intervals. The Coens could have easily left Donnie out of the film, but it's little additions like him that make this film great.\n\nThere's so many great quotes and scenes in the film, and showing the dreams in the weird mind of The Dude such as the scene with the flying carpet, just adds a bizarre yet wonderful quality that most comedies don't have.\n\nAt the end of the film, after viewing all the wacky characters, danger and plot twists, The Dude brings to your attention that all he wanted was his rug! This just adds to the comic approach the Coens went for, and The Big Lebowski leaves you feeling happy and warm inside, as you have just witnessed such greatness on screen.\n\nWhen I look at the fact that The Big Lebowski won just 1 (minor) award, it just proves that there is no justice in the world of film, and I find it hard to swallow that such genius can go unrewarded.\n\nBy my reckoning this is one of the Coen brothers finest achievements to date, up there with Fargo and Miller's Crossing, and believe me, that is some achievement. Their unique and clever scripts show they have so much more imagination than most screen writers, and despite the fact they haven't made a really great film for a few years, I hope they are just laying dormant and will give us another wonderful film such as The Big Lebowski."

Overarching theme of trying to survive, just live life without hurting others, enjoying what you have and counter points to that.

        "review_detailed_main": "I have long been a fan of the Coen Brothers films, and I admit I was hugely disappointed with the Big Lebowski when I first saw it in the theaters, especially since it was the Coen's first film release since the incredible Fargo and many viewers (like myself) had high expectations.\n\nSo I avoided viewing it again for a few years until I got the urge to complete my Coen Bros. video collection and I hoped that with the passing of some time my opinion would change. It did for the better.\n\nGranted, The Big Lebowski is still no Fargo, and I still think granting this film a higher rating than far better Coen films is awfully gratuitous, but at least it can be viewed and appreciated on it's own terms now instead of having the critical and commercial triumph of Fargo looming overhead. Unlike films such as Fargo, Barton Fink, or Oh Brother, Lebowski plays as a loose, far less structured, and meticulous affair. The Coen Bros. quirkness abounds, but seems to be devised more for pure pleasure than imagery of any deeper, metaphorical meaning. This actually makes it unique among Coen Bros. films, because one gets the sense that they just wanted to make a straight forward (for them, at least) comedy about a character thrusted in a weird predicament that's incongruous to his persona. It does seem to play a bit forced, however, as if the Coens felt that they needed to uphold their trademark stylizations, and the dialogue does get a bit wordy and tiresome after a while. It entertains on a fairly basic surface level, whereas other films in the Coen catalog (such as Barton Fink) have an incredible amount of depth and are far more thought provoking. There's nothing cryptic or profound here, the depth of the film lies in the filmmaker's vision and the character development, but not so in a storyline with any underlying hidden meanings or moral lessons.\n\nOverall an entertaining and engaging film, but definitely not the best Coen Bros. film nor \"the funniest film ever made\"."

This movie is just perfect with outstanding writing from the cohen brothers who always find new ways to make interesting stories and quirky fun characters. With all the actors doing such a bang up belieavle job this movie does everything right.\n\nThis movie is about jeffery lebowski (everyone calls the dude) (Bridges) an unemployed loser who does nothing pretty much other then bowl. One night two young thugs bust into his place thinking he was a million of the same name. After figuring out he wasn't they peed on his rug and took off. So the dude went to the million for compensation for his rug but when he gets there the old millionaire has a proposistion for him.\n\nThis movie was just so good. It felt so real and believable mainly thanks to the awesome writing and acting. It is interesting and hilarious it really is a must see."

I had to start it 4 times and by the 4th time I got over the first 5 minutes .. and boy was I hooked ! this is definitely one of the best of the Coen Bros., with a magnificent performance of Jeff Bridges (I think his best !) but also Turturro, Goodman, and Moore are a delight to see. The story unfolds in several layers and gets more interesting as the movie progresses.. but it's mostly the types that are put down which are hilarious, but still recognizable. I recommend this for any night for a movie-lover !"

When the crime genre is combined with comedy, Coens creates a mystery film where you never really know what will happen next. Although the film derails a bit towards the end, the Coen brothers saves it with their artistic skills, extraordinary characters and an excellent acting cast. And ones again shows that they are one of the best director(s) of the 21'st century with a timeless, charming, cult classic.\n\nreview originally from - 3 juli 2020"

Not to mention my sister telling me how funny this movie is and that I should definitely watch it. Well, my sister just handed me the movie and said she would not speak to me until I watched it. Some ultimatum, huh? Well, I did watch it immediately.\n\nThe Big Lebowski over all was a funny film. I had more than a few good laughs. I think my favorite running gag was between John Goodman and Steve Buchemi and how John just keeps telling him to \"Shut the F up, Donnie\" and finally his last line to him is \"These are bad men, Donnie\", I'm not sure why I found it so funny, maybe it was the way it was said. It just played off so well. Also the Jesus gag, the Spanish bowlers were hilarious. Not to mention a few other scenes of The Dude getting knocked out.\n\nBut still, I'm not too sure if I found this movie to be funnier than other comedies I prefer. I think everyone has their different taste. But my sister did say to watch it one more time, so hopefully, maybe I'll get why this is such a great movie to others.\n\n7/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I know this will get a lot of downvotes but... this movie is not good.\n\nI've tried. About six times now, I've seen The Big Lebowski, either most or in whole, and each time I wonder what people see in this movie.\n\nIt is was never particularly amusing, rarely eliciting even the thought of \"Oh, that was funny\" much less an actual chuckle. The plot isnt really engaging, as it just sort of meanders through the content. The dialogue that is often lauded, is rather weak throughout the movie, with only a few of the scenes that have been meme'd to death being some of the few \"high\" points. The plot... exists.\n\nOn a technical side, the sound isnt anything really praise-worthy, though I'm sure a lot of people will note the soundtrack itself, but that is addressed below.\n\nNor is the cinematography worth mentioning with many shots being flat/center, with an occasional dolly shot thrown in to mix things up. Even when they had a chance to make things a little more 'wild', most of the shots are still flat/center (like the Dudes bowling dream sequence).\n\nThe sound track feels almost \"obvious\", with certain choices feeling like they picked the most overly used choices they could find, or a close approximation.\n\nThe clothing looks good/like a bunch of Goodwill stuff bought the day before shooting, which is what they were going for sure, but the only thing that shines here is the set design.\n\nEach locations \"feels\" right for its place in the story. The bowling alley is straight outta middle America, the Dudes house not only looks small, dingy, and in disrepair, but the overall choices for what went into the house clearly had a lot of thought put into it. When set design is a standout in your movie, somethings wrong. The only negative is that they made the overall space, especially the livingroom, a bit too spacious for someone like the Dude to actually have, but that is just a minor niggle.\n\nThe acting is........ fine. It is not great, or even particularly good, per se, but the actors do their jobs well. Many of the characters feel one or two dimensional at best, with others being a single trait in human form. Even the Dude himself isnt much other than a stereotype of a 'cool loser' type.\n\nAs stated, the few highs are whats already been meme'd to death, and even before that, they were more 'kooky/crazy/shocking' than actually amusing.\n\n(For example, John Goodman pulling a gun over a bowling foul was never amusing, but the scene following it, where they are having a conversation in the car as the cops rush the place, WAS slightly amusing, but could have been done to better effect)\n\nIt does its best to get to the next scenes pretty quickly, which is a blessing in disguise, but it doesnt do even that in any particularly engaging manner either.\n\nI know this is a big favorite amongst the 420 crowd and certain others, and by all means keep enjoying this movie.\n\nI have tried many times to find merit in this film, even with perception altering legal substances, but its always been an extremely overrated film imho. I wish I could find what others see in this flick, but its just not there for me.\n\nMany people have stated this as their favorite movie. I've heard many different angles on why people enjoy it, but I still do not see what they do.\n\nLogjammin' was a better movie than The Big Lebowski.\n\nSorry, everyone.\n\nIts just not a good movie."

With friends like that, you certainly don't need enemies. We also meet really colorful characters like Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore), who just wants The Dude's seed; Bunny Lebowski (Tara Reid), the porn star turned gold-digger; and, of course, The Big Lebowski (David Huddleston) and his faithful servant Brandt (Philip Seymour Hoffman). And when Steve Buscemi started talking about the In and Out Burger, I almost lost it. I swore he was going to go into \"the old in and out\" routine.\n\nA visit to Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara) brings about an amazing thing that could only be described as an acid flashback. I have to admit I had my mouth open the whole time it was going on. It was just that incredible.\n\nYou should get the idea that this is not a film about kidnapping and money and criminals; it was a film about the characters. i only touched on the main ones. There are plenty more interesting gems to find.\n\nOnly the Coen brothers could have dreamed up the story of a slacker caught up in a bad situation. It was one of the funniest films I have ever seen."

I don't even think that they have seen the movie, but who cares?\n\nJeff Bridges is so stinking versatile I can't believe it from a reel-live slacker extraordinare to (The Big LeBowski 1998) a reel-President- (The Contender 2000) with out skipping a beat. For all intensive purposes this movie would be a real waste of time, but this was a side splitting whimsical good time!! From Julliane Moore as the egocentric, emotionally-sterile 'Maude' who was a suspicious investigator, to the best friend (Goodman) who's religious nationality 'changes' because of his 'Ex' who dumped him cold. But as long as he can 'bowl' with the Dude, all his other short-comings, just seem to go by the way-side. But through it all, he (Goodman's character) was a loyal buddy to Jeff and a decent friend, even if he could acquire 'fingers' by 3:00...with nail polish. In all fairness though, LeBowski as a 'private' investigator, reminds me of a quote from 'Dirty Harry' where Harry states (after the 'demise' of a man who is a victim of his own stupidity and greed) 'A man should know his own limitations.' and in this case, having Jeffrey investigate is just as swift as letting the 'fox' guard that Ole' hen house. This was a 'slackers delight' and watching someone who is as good a player as 'Bridges' play a tremendously convincing 'Loser' is just a rare treat. In the comedy section, this one is an ever so often player. Just one that you 'havfta see' every now and again. I don't know who he studied, but if I didn't know better I would swear that he got together with my two 'old school' buds. (****)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Jeff Bridges is perfect as Jeff Lebowski, a.k.a. The Dude; he's an ageing, amiable slacker who doesn't do much with his time besides bowl. When he's mistaken for a rich man (David Huddleston) with the same name, he's hired by the rich man to deliver a ransom. Things go from bad to worse in a hurry, in large part because The Dude frequently involves his loud, abrasive buddy Walter (John Goodman), a crazed Vietnam vet, in his actions.\n\nIn terms of the overall Coen brothers filmography, this is relatively minor stuff. It goes on a little too long, and wasn't always terribly funny to this viewer. It also feels self-indulgent at times. And yet, Joel and Ethan here craft a twist-laden, elaborate story that does have some good moments, as well as a highly profane script and an eclectic soundtrack. (The Dude hates The Eagles, but is a big fan of CCR.) Its quotes certainly entered the public consciousness in a big way, with Bridges quickly becoming a pop culture icon in his role. \"Well, you know, that's just like your opinion, man.\"\n\nThe main reason it worked to any degree (at least for this viewer) was because of its impressive and well-chosen cast: Sam Elliott (as a friendly narrator), Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi (as in \"Shut the *beep* up, Donny!\"), Philip Seymour Hoffman, Tara Reid, Peter Stormare, David Thewlis, Flea, Ben Gazzara, Jon Polito, etc. John Turturro is such a hoot as a bowler named Jesus that it's too bad that his screen time is so limited.\n\n\"The Big Lebowski\" is a truly character-driven comedy that does wrap up in a typically amusing way, and it shows that its main character can't just be dismissed as a non-thinking deadbeat; he knows when he's been used. It gave this viewer a conclusion that earned an honest smile, as Elliott breaks the fourth wall and comments on the nature of the yarn with which he's regaled us.\n\nSeven out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Big Lebowski is rare in the world of motion pictures. It's like a well written book (like Dune or LOTR) in that you can walk away with something new from it with each repeated viewing. The Cohen brothers put a lot of thought into their films, and the Big Lebowski is no exception.\n\nTalking crap about a movie is the easiest thing to do, and I've read a few reviews that have done just that about Lebowski. In these people's defense, it's easy to jump to this conclusion because at first glance, it appears to be a meaningless film. But if it were meaningless, why set the film during the first Gulf War? Why do a period piece set 7 years before the movie's release? Because they're playing with allegory here, trying to say something about America.\n\nThere is much evidence of this. The perceptive viewer will note that we're dealing with clearly cut characters that embody archetypes of American culture. We're also dealing with events that mimic the political and sociological landscape of 1991. In addition, most period pieces splash nostalgia all over the screen, but there's hardly any in Lebowski. This movie is a humorous, tongue-in-cheek statement about the health of the American character circa 1991.\n\nBut even if you take the meaning of the movie out of the equation, The Big Lebowski is a top notch film. The characters and their interactions in the movie are entertaining. The direction plums the depths of their potential and brings it out for us to enjoy. The scenes work to promote the themes of the movie and give us a good laugh in the process. The Cohens did their job and then some on this one, and it seems to me like they had a damn good time doing it."

Because he is funnier & deep.\n\nFollowing the story of how a slacker and his bowling club friends fall into a parade of crime is written with humor in mind. The characters are very different & genuine from each other. The boldness is another thing to consider. Great music playing as the background score, there are few moments when it comes to total laugh out. The thought of these sequences will make you laugh. Improbable situations deliberately brought out by the characters will feed you with story, narration & food for thought.\n\nLengthening the plot a bit and shut-up ending makes me feel not totally satisfied by the dude & his chums. I'll rate a humble 6.5/10 for the gang and the eclectic characters, music & setups. Very impressed as this is my first film by Coen Brothers. Steve Buscemi is good while Jeff Bridges is cool as hell.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Extremely funny for people who can relate. Moderately funny for people who enjoy logical scripts.\n\nCan be watched with a typical Indian family?

        "review_detailed_main": "Before I delve right into the review I have to say that I am great bowling fan and play it from time to time with some of my friends. Yet, I didn't saw THE BIG LEBOWSKI until last April, and when I finally did, I knew I would have loved it. As there are to date 1401 reviews I'll be short.\n\nJeffrey Lebowski known as the Dude (Jeff Bridges) is a slacker that spends most of his days in his robe and going bowling with his friends Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and Theodore Donald Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi). One day the Dude is assaulted by two enforcers sent by an adult movie kingpin Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara) despite they realize after a rug accident that they got the wrong man with the same name. After various accidents and misunderstandings, the Dude and his pals will do everything for giving the ransom money and go out of the mess.\n\nI'll talk about what I loved: Jeff Bridges gives probably his greatest performance of his colorful career, and he nailed the good-hearted slacker part well. John Goodman is also great as the obsessed Vietnam war veteran and Steve Buscemi? He gives his usual likeable performance as the guy with always the right catchphrase in the right moment. The rest (Julianne Moore, Peter Stormare, Flea, Ben Gazzara, Phillip Seymour Hoffman) is good but not as great as our three heroes. The soundtrack is very 1990s and the script witty and full of funny moments.\n\nSo, if you still haven't seen this movie, rush for it if you have the chance because it's one of those classics with a huge enjoyability factor. My only warning (and also my friend Martin Hafer said it), but still is very minor, is the language that might be too rough for younger viewers. Still, a real must see."

I will admit, first time I watched it, I thought it was ok, but it needs a second viewing, a deeper viewing. That's when you will realise how much you love it. It's a film filled with career best (and loveable) performances. Particularly from Jeff Bridges, John Goodman and an insane performance from John Turturro. Also Sam Elliot's stranger is the standard that all narration should be held to. His final speach in this movie makes me smile and cry at the same time. I can only hope that someone will say something as beautiful at my funeral."

        "review_detailed_main": "Being a staunch opponent of drug use, this brand of humor doesn't usually suit my bill, but it is still one of the funniest movies I have seen recently. The camaraderie between Bridges, Goodman, and (kind of) Buscemi is excellent, although Buscemi's portrayal of the idiotic, unaware friend got old very quickly. Perhaps the funniest scene in the whole movie is Moore's character flying overhead to squirt paint on her abstract art... after reading that her character was influenced by Yoko Ono, it couldn't be more hilarious and true. I did love the cinematography and lighting, as well as the frequent dives into psychedelic episodes. The transitions into those scenes were especially well executed. All in all, the characters were casted near perfectly, and the constant juxtaposition of a stoner and Hollywood drama sequences was hilarious... that's what works with this movie. The bare concept is so hilarious that the entire movie is just soaking it all in, and even then it isn't overdone. The biggest surprise of this movie is that some of the humor is quite sophisticated, although there are plenty of the hackneyed stoner jokes as well. For those who appreciate a good comedy and can handle a boatload of profanity, this movie is for you."

        "review_title": "A Humorous Dark Coen Brothers Film",
        "review_detailed_main": "Today I saw \"The Big Lebowski\" for the first time. Somehow I missed this movie in 1998 and never saw it on DVD in the years after its release. About the only thing that I knew about the film was that Jeff Bridges was \"The Dude\". Now I know the rest of the story.\n\nBefore moving on, I'll offer up this quick disclaimer: This is in no way a family friendly film. That should be expected from the Coen Brothers, but since I went into it not knowing what to expect at all, and my only perception of the film being that it was mostly a comedy, I thought that it might be somewhat lighter than most of the Coens' stable of films. And it was. But there's still language throughout the movie, along with some fairly adult themes at points. Several times along the way I found myself feeling that this was the Coens' answer to \"Pulp Fiction\" (the chasing of the brief case, the remark about the quality of the In-n-Out Burger, the fact that Bridges dresses like Travolta and Jackson at the end of PF, etc.).\n\nThe film is quite funny, in that dark style of humor that the Coens are known for. Sometimes the humor is so prevalent that it becomes banal. Nevertheless the film does feature quite a few good laughs. But then mixed in with those laughs are the odd Coen Brothers moments, such as what I'll call \"the ear scene\", in which the mixture of humor and horror blends in a way that challenges the viewer's comfort.\n\nMy main beef with this film is that it doesn't end with a resolution. Yes, all ends well (Spoiler alert, but \"The Dude Abides\"). Still, you never find out what happens to the briefcase or whether it had money in it (another similarity to Pulp Fiction). The situation with Bunny sort of gets forgotten, too. All in all the ending of the film just felt anticlimactic to me.\n\nI nevertheless did enjoy the movie, though. It is what it is, a Coen Brothers film that makes you laugh all while pushing boundaries. Still just as there are Elvis people and Beatles people, I think that there are Coen Bros. people and Tarrantino people, and I'm a Tarrantino person. So I think I'm going to go with 7/10 stars. Enjoyed it, but not in my top tier."

Watching it for the first time now and I thought it was really funny, had some really quotable moments, and there were a lot of creative and well-written characters.\n\nJohn Goodman and Jeff Bridges had good performances. John Goodman was surprisingly hilarious and I really enjoyed the scenes with Steve Buscemi's character and the three of them at the bowling alley a lot. I have never seen Jeff Bridges in this type of role and I thought he was really funny and really personified The Dude character well. The plot doesn't take itself too seriously and it is a good movie to just turn on and enjoy.\n\nOverall, The Big Lebowski was a really good movie and I recommend checking it out. It was a really well-made comedy and the characters had depth and were fun to watch. The Dude lowkey reminded me of one of my professors that I have had with the way he dressed and walked. Not necessarily his whole personality but parts about him. Also the cardigan The Dude wears at the end is fire. Iconic look."

Still I have to rewatch Fargo some day - and then go on with the TV show they made too of course.\n\nBut back to this - you cannot be easily offended. So much swearing ... so many weird characters (all played by really good actors most would say, even Tara Reid and her short stint in this work more than swell) ... so much craziness. And an episodic journey with his Dudeness. Jeff Bridges has done so many good movies, but this is the one movie he mostly will be remembered for. And he doesn't mind - why should he? Such a fun and over the top script and movie has to be cherished.\n\nThere are so many iconic scenes, so many quotable things - from the STFU Donny, which is used so many times, to the \"this is what happens when you ... a man in the ...\" - something I can't write here, because the review would therefor not be allowed to exist. And then the iconic car missing scene. Which sprang the title for \"Dude where's my car\" ... at least that's how the story goes.\n\nThe movie may be 2 hours long, but at no time did I feel the length of it ... wait, that may be a pun? Not as obvious as Jesus cleaning his (bowling) ball ... but still! Also nobody ... with the Jesus! I almost want to check the quotes section imdb has for the movie ... so many things they cannot write I assume.\n\nAnyway, the movie is far out and if you don't like, than I would say: That is very undude of you Dude!"

        "review_detailed_main": "THE BIG LEBOWSKI / (1998) *** (out of four)\n\nBy Blake French:\n\nThe Coen Brothers are an artistic breed of their own. They add a twisted touch of humor to every project. They create imaginative characters, memorable stories, and ingenious dialogue. They have explored the lives of poets, hillbillies, cops, mobsters, adulterers, killers, and now a loser.\n\nThat's right, \"The Big Lebowski\" explores the life of a big-time loser. A lazy, uninspiring, unemployed loser. His name is Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), who lives in the moment and wears a goatee, a beer belly, a ponytail, and a pair of oversized Bermuda shorts. He lives to bowl, drink White Russians, and to do drugs. (Character: What do you do for recreation? The Dude: Oh, the usual. Bowl, drive around. The occasional acid flashback).\n\nThe Dude's best bowling pals, Donny (Steve Buscemi), who is never allowed to finish a sentence, and Walter (John Goodman), who is stuck in the past, diddle with the Dude as he goes with the flow, inhibiting not a care in the world. Until a porn king confuses the Dude for another person with the same name of Lebowski. Thugs invade the Dude's house, plunge his head into the toilet, and pee on his rug. They leave after they realize they have mistaken his identity.\n\nHowever, the Dude wants a new rug. Walter and The Dude take a trip to the rich Lebowski's. They get more than a rug. It appears that someone has kidnapped Lebowski's daughter and the wealthy bigwig wants the Dude to deliver the ransom money. The Dude agrees, and, of course, chaos ensues.\n\nSome of the material falls flat. A subplot about a bowling maniac named Jesus (John Turrturo) goes absolutely nowhere. Fortunately, many scenes work wonderfully, featuring original ideas, thought-provoking metaphors, experimental camera techniques, and eye-popping cinematography. I especially enjoyed how the film explores the Dude's dreams with sequences bursting with color, imagination, and peculiar images.\n\nAudiences will remember \"The Big Lebowski\" as one of the most imaginative films of the decade. The Coen brothers create an odd assortment of unique circumstances and characters. The quirky characters have lots of fun with the unbelievably profane, (Screenit.com informs us that the movie uses the \"F\" word 250+ times!), but strangely amusing dialogue.\n\nWhat does it all add up to? Well, there is plenty to think about and plenty to laugh at, but we do not leave with a powerful feeling of satisfaction. \"The Big Lebowski\" may resemble the spirit of \"Raising Arizona,\" another wildly funny comedy by the Coen's, but this movie's does not quite work as well. Both contain the same zany style, but that film felt inspired by plot. \"The Big Lebowski\" lacks plot. A string of amusing predicaments does not necessarily account for the absence of story.\n\nIf the film would have followed a clear, comprehensible story, it may have been more involving, but that's clearly not what the Coen brother's wanted. Even before the opening credits begin, the film's narrator (Sam Elliot) explains that this film is about the Dude's adventures. It's not really a narrative of the Dude, but an examination of his reaction to life changing events. By the end of the movie, we sense the Dude has learned from his experiences, and because of them, he is a better person\u0085well, kind of."

I guess it's much like Marmite, a kind of love-it hate-it situation. Personally I saw the funny side of it, and the reasons for it being such a cult classic, but it just didn't fit my style.\n\nWatch Fargo instead.

If you think they could do something more out-there or interesting, sure give The Big Lebowski a go."

The 'Dude' is the personification of laziness acted to perfection by Jeff Bridges, always wearing the same tatty clothes and hilariously drinking a milky White Russian \"Hey man i got a beverage here!\" We first meet the Dude in a shopping mall - with milk on his moustache - hilariously writing a cheque for 69cents! John Goodman is the Jewish Vietnam veteran Walter Schobchek - taking every opportunity to shout about his dead 'buddies' from the war and shout at Donny (Steve Buchemi). Donny is a quiet man with very little impact on the narrative - however the comedic relationship between him, Walter and the 'Dude' is a charm.\n\nThe atmosphere created here gives superb viewing, with top notch cinematography and genuine, if obscure, relationships between the odd characters. But what you will remember most from this film are the hilarious quotations - \"F*** it dude, let go bowling\", \"Well thats just, like, your opinion man!\" and \"Obviously your not privy to the new s**t, man\" to name just a couple."

I had already seen several Coen Brothers films before seeing this movie, including the masterpiece Fargo and the hilarious Raising Arizona, so I had high expectations going in. These expectations were more than exceeded; they were shattered by non-stop laughter. John Goodman gives perhaps the funniest performance in any movie I've ever seen and Jeff Bridges IS the Dude; nobody else could have played that role. The day after seeing it for the first time I watched it again, and it was even funnier than the first time, if that is possible. In the multiple viewings since then, I am still laughing out loud and finding new quotable lines. The Big Lebowski is rare in that it is not just hysterical but it is also smart. While I enjoy stupid comedies like Zoolander and Dumb and Dumber, it is so much better when the humor is both hilarious and clever. The Big Lebowski is the funniest movie I've ever seen and one of my all time favorites. I give it my highest recommendation: 10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film still blows me away even after about 30 viewings! It is a blend of film noir/detective film(The BIG SLEEP, Maltese Falcon/All Through the Night)/comedy. The funny thing about it is you don't even realize that it is a detective film until you've seen it 2-3 times. I was loosely aware but it really sank in after the 3rd viewing! (i'm slow, i know) \"The Dude\"(Jeff Bridges)is in just about every scene, if not every scene. You get so caught up in watching him, his \"laid backness\", and his compatriots that you forget they are actually involved in trying to negotiate a ransom drop and recover a kidnap victim.\n\n\"The Dude\" is a reluctant hero along the lines of \"Rick\" from \"Casablanca\". Although not so self centered and altruistic as \"Rick\", it is evident from the start that \"The Dude\" would much rather be bowling and have a drink(a \"White Russian\", or as he called it, \"a Caucasian\") than have the responsibility of saving anyone's life.\n\nThere may not be as many classic lines in this film as there are in the great films I compared it to above,but there are as many, if not more lines that get quoted by those who know and love this film.\n\nThe last time I saw this(Big Lebowski) I kept asking myself what film does it remind me of the most? Then it hit me...\"The Big Sleep\". ;)"

I was in the mood to watch this for the first time the other night, 20 years later.\n\nI love Jeff Bridges' character. He is great. I love John Goodman as an actor but his character here was more annoying than anything. I think Steve Buscemi's character should have been more developed and involved, and taken some screen time from Goodman. A little Goodman in this character would have been hilarious but not overly played out."

Hardcore film nerd or not, many of us probably have a go-to film that we've seen countless times and know the lines almost by heart, but still enjoy it as much every time. Well, to me, The Big Lebowski is that film.\n\nTrying to deconstruct what is so funny or brilliant about it is probably somewhat counterproductive, but I will say that it is one of the best scripts I have ever seen, and the characters as well as the cast behind them are nothing short of perfection. And most of all, it is so insanely entertaining and quotable.\n\n\"You know, he's got emotional problems, man.\"\n\n\"You mean beyond pacifism?\""

In the folks I spoke with I think it's the actual character that inspires, excites, and evokes such devotion amongst them. This I can kind of understand. But with the film as a whole there's a bit of a divergence. The film itself is basically fine. With the exception of a few specifics the story isn't that original but what is unique in this story is the strong central characters (The Dude) reaction to/and handling of those situations and scenarios. Yes, Jeff Bridges does a great job create a unique and believable character in The Dude, but the film he inhabits is just fine. Check it out and see what you think."

Unpredictable and free spirited, the \"Dude\", our protagonist gets caught in a web of intrigue. This intrigue seemingly and annoyingly takes him away from his happy life of apathy, unemployment and bowling. THE BIG LEBOWSKI is strictly Coen Brothers madness, in the vein of RAISING ARIZONA. The visuals, dream sequences, et al, are very funny and fit well in the movie. Unfortunately, the last half starts to slow down, as the characters start to seem repetitive in their reactions. The humor also waned, due to this, and the plot, not the film's strong suit to begin with, wears down with it. THE BIG LEBOWSKI is still yards ahead of most mainstream releases, yet we've grown rather accustomed (even spoiled) to expect so much more from the Coens. Recommended."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Big Lebowski\" is considered to be among the best movies ever made. The Coen brothers have wrote and directed a wonderful epic movie that has a huge fan base till this day. Centered around a figure called \"the dude\" who finds himself in an unlikely weird adventure consisting of neo nazis, thugs, a big scam, dirty undies and bowling. Jeffrey Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is the dude and the perfect example of an unemployed bachelor middle aged guy who's life style is mostly cannabis and bowling. Jeff Bridges gives what is probably his best performance in a movie ever, and it is known for being his most iconic role ever. John Goodman also gives a wonderful and amazing performance as Walter Sobchak and is mostly hilarious in the film. Gets all the good lines. The film stars other great and well actors: Steve Buscemi, Julianne Moore, John Turturro, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Sam Elliott. What I love mostly about the film is it's empty plot. Of course there is a lot going on but there are so many bizarre things happening that it doesn't matter anymore what the film's about, nor what are the films motives. In one opening scene you get an introduction to the character and how two thugs ruin his rug. In another scene the dude's car is stolen. Afterwards the characters go investigate a teenager and end up ruining somebody else's car. The point is that the plot is not important, the movie draws most of its magic from the characters and their interactions. Which to me is an important key role in movies to have characters who are fun and have many things happening to them. At the end of the day this is probably one of the best movies ever made and the dude abides on that. Now let's go bowling."

The cast is brilliant with John Goodman and Steve Buscemi as the Dude's best friends and bowling buddies. Julianne Moore is particularly memorable as Maude Lebowski. David Huddleston played Jeff Lebowski is also memorable. Phillip Seymour Hoffman played Brandt, his assistant. The film is really a great film for the guys in general.

Instantly likable, the Dude's own slant on life is that most things can be solved by taking it easy or going bowling. His partners in crime are Walter; a deranged 'Nam verteran (John Goodman in superb scene-stealing form), Donny, one of his bowling buddies (Steve Buscemi in an understated role) and David Huddleston as the title character, complete with assistant Brandt (Philip Seymour Hoffman, turning the smarm right up to ten). What starts as a simple case of mistaken identity and damaged property quickly becomes a roller-coaster tale of backstabbing and caricature characterisation which gets faster and more twisted as it reaches the final minutes.\n\nThe first time I saw this I must say, it just seemed ludicrous and not at all humorous. I wasn't really sure whether it wanted to be a comedy or a surreal drama. After getting about two thirds of the way through I got up and walked out, convinced that this was the worst film in the Coen brothers canon. But on a second viewing I stopped taking this film too seriously and it was then the offbeat comedy and plot really came together.\n\nIngenious, hilarious and unexpected you really don't have a clue what is going to happen, but the direction and cinematography make it seem like it was inevitable all along.

We must adopt the Dude's carefree attitude. This movie teaches us that all you need in life are a few good friends and a recreational activity in which you enjoy greatly, in the Dude's case, bowling was what he enjoyed the most. Whether we put this lesson to use ourselves or not, it's like the Stranger said, `It's good knowin' he's out there. The Dude. Takin' 'er easy for all us sinners.'"

I smoke marijuana regularly and enjoy some stoner films, but damn this was just boring. I also like bowling and I'm Jewish so I really thought it would resonate. But maybe too much time has passed and that style of comedy is no longer humorous unless it's pressing your nostalgia buttons. Glad I watched after many years but I didn't miss anything."

I don't consider it one, but I still found it very entertaining and was not disappointed. Our basic plot is stoner and loser Jeffrey \"The Dude\" Lebowski is mistaken for millionaire Jeffrey Lebowski, when men break in to his house and pee on his rug. To get the money for the rug The Dude goes to Jeffrey Lebowski, and ends up on a mission to find rich Lebowski's kidnapped wife. The movie is fairly fast paced, but that doesn't stop it from having periods of heavy clever dialogue, mostly between John Goodman as the ex-Vietnam veteran Walter and the Dude. Many of the film's most entertaining scenes are located in the bowling alley where The Dude, Walter and Donnie (Buscemi) talk about nothing and (of course) bowl. The backup cast is really good also, including Julianne Moore as the \"kidnapped\" wife and John Turturro as a sex offender bowler. Though I don't consider this to be a great classic film, it's still a good, fun movie with enough gusto to keep the whole thing afloat.\n\nMy rating: *** out of ****. 113 mins. R for sexuality/nudity, violence, drug use and language."

It is rated almost five stars in Amazon. It is rated 8.2 on IMDb. It has to be good, right?\n\nNot quite. I couldn't finish it - I had to stop watching it.\n\nIn the beginning you see a resemblance in the style of this movie and a lot of Quentin Tarantino's movies. I don't know if Coen brothers are borrowing from Quentin Tarantino, or if it's the other way around, but there seems to be plenty of resemblance to this film and Tarantino's films in general.\n\nThe best Coen brothers movie that they made was Fargo, and maybe it was so good because it was based on a true story. But for this, The Big Lebowski, it reeked of stupidity...but without comedy. It seemed to border on fantasy and improbability."

When the film started with a voice-over of an old man i thought \"oh this is gonna be so long and boring\", but it wasn't until 5 minutes later that I totally changed my mind, and I was sucked into the story-line . I gave this film eight stars and I would definitely recommend it."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Big Lebowski is perhaps the most surreal film from the Coen brothers, who have made their careers on surreal, dark comedies. There are numerous diversions, but the main plot is a take on ransom films. The film would have been a massive failure if not for some key performances. Jeff Bridges is The Dude, a.k.a. Jeff Lebowski, who is mistaken for a millionaire of the same name whose wife owes money to a pornographer. The Dude is an unemployed layabout who bowls with his two friends Walter and Donny. Walter is played by John Goodman, who portrays the character as a short-tempered Vietnam vet who uses his military service to justify his behavior. He constantly yells at Donny (Steve Buscemi) for no real reason, and waves guns at minor bowling infractions. The Dude finds himself caught up in the Big Lebowski's ransom as the millionaire hires him to give the ransom to the kidnappers. The millionaire's aide is Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who plays a sycophantic named Brandt. Hoffman is the third most enjoyable character in the film, with his forced laugh and yes-man lines.\n\nThe simple ransom goes horribly wrong and the plot gets ever more complex as more characters are added. This one of a few comedies that warrants multiple viewings just to understand it. There are enough quotable lines to be entertaining upon first watch but you have to see it again to discern the genius of the plot turns.\n\nThe dream sequences take away from the film as they are too long and don't really move the movie forward or even introduce a side-plot. Still, the film is one of the best Coen films (not as great as Fargo, but what is?) and it remains a cult classic and one of the best comedies ever made."

        "review_detailed_main": "The thing about movies made by the Coen Brothers is that I either love them (Fargo) or they leave me flat (The Big Lebowski). There is a thin line between comic and tragic, and here the lead characters never find it. As played by Jeff Bridges and John Goodman, two dumber Polacks have never graced the silver screen. Yet, there is nothing Polish or Polish-American about these losers---\"The Dude\" Lebowski and Walter Sobchak-except their names, and \"Sobchak\" is a very un-Polish spelling. There are a couple of assumptions that you have to make to laugh at the jokes in this 1998 film. One is that Polish surnames are innately funny and you should laugh when you hear one, especially when it is associated with intelligent thought or combined with an American given name (\"Bunny Lebowski\"). The only time you hear the word \"Polish\" in the movie is when The Dude explains to Sobchak that he is \"not even Jewish\": \"You're f---ing Polish-Catholic.\" So why see this film? Because it raises a lot of questions, such as: What's so funny about stupidity? Why does John Goodman seem to be doing an imitation of Roseanne Barr? Would this have worked better as a cartoon? Why is \"Lebowski\" considered a \"jerk-off name\"? Another reason is to watch Julianne Moore deliver another bizarre but intriguing performance. As Maude Lebowski, she leads The Dude, a burned-out hippie, into the only one of his lines that made me laugh out loud by asking him post-coitally what he does for recreation. As if it's the first time he's ever been asked, he thinks for a second, then replies, \"Go bowling, drive around, and the occasional acid flashback.\""

The storyline in general is poor...in my opinion.....sometimes I felt as if the movie has just stopped..... Look Burn after reading for instance.....it's the most great movie of Coen brothers.....I loved it!!! The main characters are great in The big Lebowski despite of their just passable interaction ....highlighting Jesus, who was by far my favorite character...appealing, flashy, arrogant and clueless at the same time... On the background I've enjoyed the subject, specially the greed, which is continuously at our side all the time.... live, and see how petty and greedy people are.... Bottom line, if you are looking for a deep and dense experience under Coen's label, this is not the right movie, try No place for old country, Fargo or mainly Burn after reading."

Looking at it after now 10 years after it was made is not only still a great laugh, but also inspiring. It's good now and then to get back in to rock and roll. I think the movie tackles important questions about life, in an intensely comical and intelligent way. I live in Europe and it might just be that people who are not so familiar with the American culture would not be able to catch the great humor, but I feel blessed to be able to understand the hero that the dude is playing. i truly wish i was like him."

And in fact, people like Dude, Walter and Donnie can often be found in various segments of the population in any country, whether it be the States or Russia. Infantile, psychotic, notorious and at the same time strangely charming inhabitants of the Coen universe suddenly gained a wide audience.

Perfect character development and acting combined with an out-there but flawlessly-interwoven series of plots are the perfect combination for laughs. I can't get enough of this movie, and neither will you.\n\nThis story follows three bowling buddies- Lebowski aka \"The Dude\" (Jeff Bridges), an aging burnout hippie with a carefree, laidback manner; Walter (John Goodman), a large Vietnam War veteran who approaches his daily life and philosophy as if he were still at war; and Donnie (Steve Buschemi), a dimwit follower placed mostly for comic relief. A case of mistaken identity gets the three caught up in the aftermath of a kidnapping, and watching their antics as they try to sort their way through the situation is as funny a thing as I've seen.\n\nI think the beauty in this movie is that there don't have to be any jokes or actual attempts to be funny to produce a laugh. The characters, just by being themselves, make the movie funny. Every scene where they're in the bowling alley talking to each other- there's no joke or attempt at humor, just a burnout, a dimwit, and a gun toter with post-traumatic stress disorder sitting there talking for five minutes, and I die laughing. Heck, there doesn't even have to be dialog! The scene where Lebowski is driving down the road smoking a roach- two minutes go by from start to end without an intelligible word of dialog, and I must have laughed 3 times. Or his reaction to being forced in the limo (\"Watch out, there's a beverage here!\"). He was being serious, and that by itself made it funny. Just by being themselves, the characters are funny and hence the movie is funny. Well, that and a few well-placed dream sequences!\n\nIf you haven't seen this movie, drop what you're doing and run to the video store. You are in for a treat."

Thugs were sent to his home by Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara) to recover a debit; Big Lebowski's (The Millionaire) wife owes him. Before the thugs realize they have the wrong Lebowski and that he's the \"Dude\" they urinate of his rug; leaving Dude in disgust. Dude pays BigLebowski (David Huddleston) a visit to be compensated for his rug being destroyed. Big Lebowski filled with arrogance; felt he was there looking for a hand out. Dude felt the conversation wasn't getting anywhere and decided he would take a rug from Lebowski home to be even.\n\nWhen Bunny (Tara Reid) disappears (Lebowski's wife); Big Lebowski contacts Dude making him an offer to be the bagman. The only thing Dude has to do is deliver the ransom money for Bunny. Dude brings Walter (John Goodman) along to make the drop. When the drop goes to pieces it creates a ricochet of others trying to reclaim the ransom money.

He is woken once his bowling ball drops him back to the surface.\n\nAfter coming back to reality, Dude is greeted by a women flying through the air on a stripe line in the nude, Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore). Dude and Maude forms a relationship. Dude without realizing has been sized up to be a sperm donor of her child. Dude experienced many encounters because he was trying to clear his identity. After having sex with Maude and enjoy a marijuana joint, at that moment Dude realized the reasoning behind the mistaken identity fiasco. In conclusion, as a motif in the film \"Dude\" was the main character's name; however, it was used as a common word of expression during dialogue. Dude was able to regain his identity and continued being the old lazy, laid back, unemployed, and bowler from Southern California."

Yet, the first time I saw this film I didn't think it was a great movie since I didn't realize the true greatness of it (in fact, I think no one did). This is because the movie is not about the plot or about the message. This movie is great because of its characters, dialogue and aesthetics, things that are most appreciated with successive viewings. It's the little details that will make this your favourite comedy of all time.\n\nJeff Bridges, John Goodman and Steve Buscemi are outstanding as the three bowling buddies and excellently supported by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Julianne Moore. In fact I think most would agree that Jeff Bridges and especially John Goodman gave award-winning performances. The dialogue is truly amazing. I mean how many movies are bestowed with so many memorable lines as this one? It is also truly unique. For a good-hearted and laid-back sort of film, to contain that many and different subtle references to cultural idiosyncrasies really says something. Finally, and I think this is what gives the movie defining cult status, it's the aesthetics. You can tell the effort made by directors and actors alike in carefully constructing each character. Each character has been embedded with a particular style and ethos which explain their way of going about things. Each character is both cause and effect of different generational prototypes mingling with each other in that psychedelic fauna that is The Big Lebowski."

Get a load of this thing: it's a mystery yarn set against the backdrop of a bowling tournament, with more F-words than a whorehouse, a host of whacked-out characters and the protagonists are a stoner and his crazy Vietnam veteran buddy. It's also one of the most quotable movies ever produced. The magic is in the dialogue.\n\nBut it's one of my all-time favorite movies because of the two leads. John Goodman seems to exist solely to keep Jeff Bridges in a state of perpetual exasperation, and their bickering never fails to send me into a fit of giggles.\n\nAlso, if I can get Sam Elliott to narrate my life story, I'd call that a big bucket of win.\n\n10/10"

If you liked Fargo, you might also like this because it involves a simple plot, but involves several incidents that add to the story and make it funnier as it goes.\n\nThere are several unique characters like the artist played by Julianne Moore, the Hispanic bowler named Jesus played by John Turturro, and one of my favorite characters is the boisterous bowler named Walter, who is played by John Goodman. The story is centered around a lowlife bowler named Jeff Lebowski, or 'the dude' as everyone calls him. One day his house is broken into and his beloved carpet is soiled, all because he was mistaken for a multimillionaire with the same last name as him. He tries to get help from the Big Lebowski, but doesn't get anything, until the big Lebowki needs help and the Dude and his bowling buddies decide to assist him. The result is an entertaining and wickedly hilarious trip to regaining the dude's prized possession.\n\nThe plot is simple at first, until it gets more complex. The film requires more viewings to appreciate everything, but there is still plenty to like the first time you see it, such as the humor, the camera angle shown through the finger hole of a bowling ball, and the clever dream sequences. See this film once to be entertained, but see it several other times to realize the genius that was involved in it."

Perhaps the problem was the fact that I lost count of the number of F-bombs in the first few minutes. When the opening dialog would be incomprehensible if all the obscenities were bleeped, you know you have a problem. When the slutty wife of the rich Lebowski (as opposed to Jeff Bridges' character) offers a \"bl*w job\" for $1000, it's no longer funny to me - it just makes me squirm. Perhaps I am just becoming stuffy as I grow older, but I don't think so. I think I have a better appreciation of quality, and this movie ain't it."

It is a believable part and most importantly hilarious. He does it all, the laziness, the swearing, the acid trips. Steve Buscemi, also from Fargo, is great as Donny. His dialog, though few and far between, complements the dialog of the Dude and Walter. Which brings us to Walter, as played by John Goodman. I'm not sure who swears more, Walter or the Dude, but I would put my money on Walter. The point it is Walter who fulfills every stereotype you've heard about this movie. The rudeness, the nonsense, the lack of coherence, etc. Of course there are numerous supporting parts as well, the Big Lebowski, Jesus, etc. that only add to the film. In the end, if you love movies like Spaceballs and Bad Santa, you'll love this. If not, at least give it a chance and keep an open mind."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Big Lebowski follows a man who, after being mistaken for a rich man with the same name, seeks vengeance against the people who mistook him and peed on his rug.\n\nIt's a weird concept, and that's where a lot of the comedy comes from. Most of the comedy here is pretty good, I found myself laughing a fair bit. A few jokes fall flat, and by the end the movie is just grasping at straws to get both a good ending and some good comedy in there, but as a whole it's a weirdly funny movie.\n\nThe writing is pretty good too. While it is, again, quite weird and unconventional, it was fun to watch the characters awkwardly live their uninteresting lives, meanwhile balancing the whole rug situation. And the characters were pretty well written too. They were consistent and, there's that word again, weird.\n\nThe Coen brothers have this way with their movies where they all tend to be quite unconventional and sometimes give off a bad vibe, like it's just too unconventional and thus sometimes hard to fully enjoy. Don't get me wrong I like their movies, they're just really different and not always in a good way, and The Big Lebowski is one of those movies.\n\nMoreover, it could be a little slow from time to time. The plot made little progress throughout basically the entire thing, and all the characters really stayed in the same place right up to the end.\n\nOverall The Big Lebowski is a good movie, but it's far from the classic people seem to think that it is. Sure, it's funny and mostly well written, but it's a little slow and overly weird, and not everything always works. In the end I'd still recommend it, but it's not as good as people seem to think it is. Not in my book, anyway."

Great performances, Jon Goodman especially was just made for the role. Above all the script for this film is so tight that you can watch this film time after time and not get tired of it and Goodmans speech on the cliff to the dead Donny is one of the greatest bits of film ever."

Some kind of revenge or threat. Anyhow, they pee on the hippie namesake's oriental rug.

It's done regularly in Iran where almost every home is furnished up the walls in hand manufactured rugs and carpets, and where young kids might pee, or worse, on them.\n\nThis picture, on the other hand, is not washable.

It's NOT hysterically funny that the Dude carries a drink with him, and sometimes spills it. It's not hilarious to have someone pee on the Dude's rug. It's not funny when Walter explains how easy it is to obtain a toe, WITH green nail polish on it (ok, that was pretty funny).\n\nWhat IS funny is how all of this fits together. The world's biggest stoner solving a fairly complex mystery. The interaction of 3 long-time friends, who don't really get along all the time. The crazy plot twists that we can barely follow, much less having the Dude follow them after endless joints and white Russians.\n\nAs the Coens said in the extended DVD - This is a buddy movie above all. The story of 3 friends of differing qualities, with VERY different outlooks on life.\n\nWatch this movie again if you didn't get it the first time. Then again if you STILL don't get it. And if you still don't get it after 3 watches - try the Farrelly Brothers -- the Coen Brothers probably aren't your style!\n\n10/10, without question."

How the Coens manage to put every sort of character, plot twists, unordered sequences and musical interludes into a film and still make it work is magical to me.\n\nJeff Bridges plays \"the Dude\" perfectly in this film opposite John Goodman as his buddy Walter. The duo are absolutely hilarious together and seem to play flawlessly off of each other throughout the film. Steve Buscemi plays a short but funny role as the spaced out friend of the Dude and John Turturro may have well stole the show playing the over-indulgent exposer/bowler Jesus.\n\nThis film contains some of the most hilarious and wacky scenes that I have seen in a long time. These include: the scene in which thugs bust into the Dude's lair and dunk his head in his toilet and then proceed to urinate all over his rug, the scene in which the Dude writes a check for 69 cents, the scene in which the Germans bust into the Dude's lair and put a Marmot into the tub with him while he is having a bath and the fight scene between the Germans and the Dude, Walter and Buscemi's character.\n\nThis film worked for me in every aspect except for the lack of a plot to guide the film and the overlong ending. Regardless of these points, The Big Lebowski is about as much entertainment as one should be able to watch in two hours.\n\n7/10 stars."

Materials of the finest quality mature with age and stand the test of time. This film never gets old and only improves with each sequential viewing the way summer block-busters never can.

Those who find it stupid, boring, for potheads only, etc... well, I can only feel sorry for them. They're missing something fundamental. This is film-making, story-telling, performing and writing at the very top of the game. Easily, for my money, the best that the Coen brothers have ever made.

The plot is interesting that takes twist and turns making you as the viewer think and that's really what a movie should do as you know that method is a staple of the Coen Brothers yet this film is blended with laughs to make it more enjoyable. Set in L.A. it focuses on the life of a laid back and down to earth common slacker Jeff Lebowski(Jeff Bridges)who's only enjoyment is smoking pot, drinking beer and hanging out with his friends and bowling. The two friends are a crazed Vietnam war veteran(John Goodman) and a lonely loser(Steve Buscemi). All of sudden this trio of bowling buddies will find themselves on an unexpected journey of facing crazy characters and being involved in an apparent kidnapping case that's tied to mistaken identity.\n\nSo clearly this is a wild goose chase type of film that's unique as some of the scenes are strikingly visual and it's plot keeps you thinking also look for good supporting turns from Juilanne Moore and Phillp Seymour Hoffman. This is a film that will appeal mostly to the hippie culture and older people still it has plenty of laughs and it's creative enough to last in memory as a unique cult art cinema classic. So remember Dude \"The Big Lebowski\" is an offbeat film that strikes a unique score any film watcher will find it's plot very creative that's blended well with laughs! And the acting was in fine form as the chemistry of the characters made the film work so clearly this is an underrated classic to remember."

And these sorts of people, who you'll meet at the bar or bowling alley may have their own issues, such as Walter, but they are friends nonetheless, and even if you don't have a lot of assets, you can still have friends.\n\nSo, for me, this film in a way celebrates the poor, the humble, those who are overlooked or called losers. Even though things don't exactly work out for the Dude and Walter, and I hated to see Donnie die, but life goes on for them just as it had before the story. They keep muddling thru no matter what.\n\nThe negatives for me which hold this film back from a higher rating are the excessive cursing, vulgarity, and extended dream sequences. For these reasons, I give it a 7.0/10.0."

        "review_detailed_main": "Like many other lovers of The Big Lebowski, I was baffled by this movie and didn't really care for it all that much after the first viewing, and didn't realize what a fantastic piece of work it was until I watched it again late one night on USA network while rocking a new born baby to sleep. Despite the edits and commercial interruptions, everything fell into place for me and I rented it again and watched it over and over, each time finding something new and wonderfully funny. I now own it on DVD and watch it at least once a month. And it just gets funnier each time.\n\nFirst of all, I'm surprised that I have never seen anyone notice that this movie is the Coens fractured version of a modern day Western. The tumblin tumbleweed, the cowboy music, and Sam Elliot's narrative at the beginning should have been a huge tip off. In addition, the structure of this movie broadly mirrors that of John Ford's classic horse opera \"The Searchers,\" though many of the elements are inverted. Most Westerns have a hero who is an outsider who only wants what is rightfully his (in The Big Lebowski, the Dude is a social misfit who just wants his rug back). Like the girl who was kidnapped by Native Americans in \"The Searchers,\" this movie has a girl who has been purportedly abducted by a group foreign to the settled community (German Nihilists). And like every western movie, there is a violent showdown at the end, though most westerns don't have a showdown anywhere near as funny (\"Dipsh** with a Nine-toed Woman!...Anti-Semite\").\n\nBut its not the amateur film school analysis that makes this movie great, its the acting, the characters, the dialogue, and the many twists and turns that are tied up at the end.\n\nThe dialogue is richly funny, though you have to watch the movie several times to catch everything said, since the characters are constantly interrupting one another and trying to talk over each other. I think this is one reason that people who have only seen this movie once didn't like it. The humor in what the Dude, Donny, and Walter are saying to each other is killer, and its even funnier when you realize that none of them are really listening to each other.\n\nFor those who haven't seen the movie yet, you might want to remember this. If you see it and don't think the movie makes any sense, remember that many people who love this movie didn't \"get it\" either the first time around."

I guess I got my work cut out for me. What redeems the act of watching TBL?\n\nTo me, it's about a time. It captures a time and collective head-space. And it does that so very, very well that the flick deserves to be put in a time capsule so future generation will understand that prior head-space better.\n\nBut... even better than that is how it seems to hint that the head-space has a univerality to it. The attitudes and lifestyles it depicts aren't strictly \"dated\". And perhaps that's the final beauty of the flick; what we expect from any/all narrative arts: On one hand, the characters are rooted in their milieu, but on the other, they reflect something universal.\n\nAnd... I think I just did my job. I explain why I give it a \"10\" rating, and also avoid spoiling it."

While Bridges is amazing in this, it is the supporting cast that shine. John Goodman is exceptionally good. Steve Buscemi is so underplayed he is fantastic. Julianne Moore, John Tuturro, Tara Reid, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and the rest are \"all in\" in this one and every scene, every line has meaning.

In the end, The Big Lebowski is a perfectly imperfect masterwork that will remain timeless and endlessly hilarious throughout the rest of its days. My Rating: 10/10"

Even Tara (pre lipo-dappled tummy) Reid is good as a gold digging trophy wife of the \"big\" Lebowski. But, hands down funniest, greatest role of the movie goes to Dan Goodman as Walter. He will have you rolling in the aisles as they say. Go get yourself some jellies, a man cardigan and a \"caucasian\" and enjoy this delectable offering from the Coen brothers. About one man's quest to get his rug back, this movie is original, funny, features bowling........what more could you want???? There is a reason that random strangers can quote Lebowski with you - every line is a gem."

Compared to the other characters in the film he actually seems quite normal. The contrast between the calm, laid-back nature of the Dude and the extroverted or aggrassive nature of other characters is what makes the film so entertaining. This becomes especially clear in the legendary interactions and dialogues between him and his bowling collegue Walter. Every single scene of the film is crazy, funny and definitely unique. The scenes have a great recognition value, which means that the film is still extremely fun to watch even after several times. The film ist a cult classic and rightly so."

Sometimes I could not see a common theme in the story, and that is probably what made it a bit boring at a certain point for me.\n\nWhat is better than the story itself are the characters and the dialogues between them. This is what gives this movie its comedic value in my opinion. Memorable quotes combined with a great cast. John Goodman as a Vietnam veteran who sticks to his past and Jeff Bridges as a jobless hippie who wants to be called \"The Dude\" were a perfect casting choice. It felt like those two were born just to play these roles.\n\nEthan and Joel Coen created something that today still holds as one of the best comedic movies. I think watching this a second time will make it funnier than it was the first time.\n\nThat's why \"The Big Lebowski\" (1998) gets from me 7.0 out of 10 points."

        "review_detailed_main": "AWESOME. Seriously, this was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I have no idea what it's about, but I liked it. I kind of detected a 'circle of life' thing...in the world of L.A. slackers, everything works out, man, don't worry. Donnie dies, little Lebowski is born. Thus it continues. But you don't watch this for the message. It's got an excuse for a plot, at least: Big Lebowski's wife owes money to crooks and is kidnapped. 'The Dude' Lebowski is mistaken for the millionaire by the same name and his carpet is pi$$ed upon in a misunderstanding. Seeking compensation for the rug (which really tied the room together) he ends up commissioned to deal with the crooks. Introduce a trio of Nihilists (with marmot), a half-crazed feminist painter (Julianne Moore), a porno film industry and a gay pedophile who's extremely competitive about bowling (John Turturro) and you've got it...the ultimate stoned slacker comedy. Jeff Bridges is far out as The Dude, and hilariously understated, while John Goodman is his psychotically violent 'Nam vet best friend, who carries a piece to a bowling alley, and John Turturro is forever etched into my memory as Jesus Quintana (spoken to Walter: \"You got a date for Wednesday, baby! Whoo!\" Walter: \"...He's cracking.\") Steve Buscemi was adorably pathetic as Donnie, the third wheel. One of the best quotes: Donnie: Are these the Nazis, Walter? Walter: No, Donnie, these men are Nihilists. There's nothing to be afraid of. It was very memorable, with excellent characters which is basically all that made it worth watching...the Coen's signature style doesn't come through here like it does in Fargo, and it's not overly artistic (well...in parts maybe) but it's so funny! Excellent, excellent. Especially The Dude's stoned dreams (which feature Saddam Hussein renting out bowling shoes)."

        "review_detailed_main": "Agreed, the enormously popular Coen Brothers are an acquired taste. And the David Lynches of quirky slapstick must be considered a hit-and-miss affair, but diehard fans are almost always left hungry for more.\n\nIn the indigestible \"The Big Lebowski\", however, somebody REALLY forgot to tell the boys that off-the-wall just for the sake of off-the-wall can REALLY be bad. Like the equally indulgent and incomprehensible \"Mulholland Drive,\" this so-called entertainment misses at every step -- as spoof, satire, revenge comedy, whatever.\n\nCheck out \"Raising Arizona\" and \"Fargo\" to see real genius at work. Unfortunately, the Bros took a total sabbatical from creative filmmaking when they locked horns on this one. I guess the success of \"Fargo\" went SO to their heads that they decided to test their core fans. Are we now SO cool and SO popular that we can pass anything off as long as its weird?\n\nObviously, from the looks of things, they can. Oh, please, IMDB people -- this \"film\" is BOTTOM \"250\", not TOP \"250\" material. It reminds me of the time back in the 1970s when Paul McCartney wagered that he too could throw out anything musically and have the gullible public eating it up. And so he did. He composed a new pop tune using the lyrics of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\", of all things, and earned his next solid hit. Ugh! I fear for the future of mankind when stuff like this happens.\n\nA thuddingly dull, incoherent mess that purports to be a quirky comedy, Jeff Bridges and John Goodman, who play bowling teammates, are the primary victims of this highway robbery. Sad too, because this could have been Goodman's night to shine (as he did in \"Raising Arizona\") and, God bless 'em, he does give it both barrels, but what can you do when you're given blanks? Always the professional, Goodman tries to act cool...like he's in on the insanity. A sleazy Bridges too rolls with the punches as a pothead slacker named Dude who through a series of mistaken identities finds a way of making make some quick dough involving a porno king and mobsters.\n\nHow can such a dazzling, eclectic cast, who are perfect for this peculiar type of movie fodder, be so abominably misused? Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, Peter (\"Fargo\") Stormare, Ben Gazzara, and David Huddleston in the title role are such pros and come off looking like rank amateurs. The last vignette with narrator Sam Elliott on a barstool is the capper. Terrible...just terrible.\n\nThere are two reasons only why I gave this \"BOMB\" a \"2\" out of \"10\" instead of \"1\". John Turturro as a creepy bowler named Jesus literally comes out of nowhere and demonstrates the Coen Brothers at full potential. His freakishly hilarious scene (which, of course, makes no sense whatsover) shows exactly what can happen when the Bros assert themselves.\n\nThe other reason is sentimental. Much of the action takes place at the Hollywood Lanes on Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood, California, where I use to bowl every Monday night. I loved that place as it holds many fond memories. Out of nowhere the district decided to tear the place down in the summer of 2002 to make room for a school. Opposers, like myself, felt it was a landmark and deserved to be protected. Anyway, it's gone now.\n\nThe good news: Any time I get nostalgic for the old bowling center, I can always rent out \"The Big Lebowski.\" The bad news: I have to rent out \"The Big Lebowski.\""

Over time, reviews have become largely positive, and the film has become a cult favorite,noted for its eccentric characters, comedic dream sequences, idiosyncratic dialogue, and eclectic soundtrack. In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". A spin-off, titled The Jesus Rolls, was released in 2020, with Turturro reprising his role and also serving as writer and director."

You could, for instance, have some effectively planned and executed comical moments, a cleverly funny written script or some amusing characters that can make your movie. \"The Big Lebowski\" is however a movie that has this all in it.\n\nWhen watching a Coen brothers movies you always know that you are going to get something special and unique. Their comedy style and just overall way off film-making are very distinctive, which is not in the least also due to the fact hat besides directing and producing all of their movies, they also write and edit them themselves. So all of their movies are really being their movies, with some exaggerated characters, dark comedy and violence and lots of eye for detail with its filming, as well as with its writing.\n\nThing that catches immediately the attention about this movie is how incredibly well written and layered the movie is. Just when you think that they can't possible throw in another story-line, with different new characters, they do and it also manages to work out well for the movie, which is all the more a great accomplishment. There is really a lot going on in this movie, even though its main character itself is extremely laid back and manages to get himself into trouble by basically doing nothing at all.\n\nYes, the Dude makes this movie what it is and also makes it work out as well as it does. It's a great character, who basically seems like a left over product from the '70's and has made no attempt to adapt himself to the 'new' world or just normal society in general. He simply does his thing, which is bowling, driving around and having the occasional acid flashback. It's good that there are guys like him being around, who go against the flow and simply follow their own path. Not to be a rebel but just to simply do only the things he wants to and simply life his live without worrying about tomorrow or yesterday. Yes, Jeffrey 'The Dude' Lebowski has grown into an iconic character already, which of course is also thanks to Jeff Bridges performances of him.\n\nBut the whole movie is being filled with some real great and memorable comedy characters. All of them are quite over-the-top, which suits the world the Coen brothers create with their movie. It really has a dream cast and what is it with John Goodman and the Coen brothers, who always seem to bring out the best from Goodman. John Goodman always seems at home within a Coen brothers movie, no matter what type of role he ever plays.\n\nThe movie does not only handle its comedy extremely well, it's also simply technically a very well made movie. The directing is truly great and it uses all kinds of different techniques and tricks, which help to give the movie a very special, warm and amusing type of atmosphere.\n\nBut yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, my opinion, man.\n\n9/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "Watching this film I got a very strong sense that the Coen brothers created a character and then everyone involved in the film found themselves falling in love with him. There's so much absurdity in this film, but at it's heart is a character whose realness (in the sense of \"keeping it real\") grounds it all. So many things test the Dude's commitment to his own personal ethic and, in what is essentially a romp, the challenge to his moral compass creates layers one can't imagine from a synopsis of the film.\n\nAnd it's all perfectly executed: Jeff Bridges is fantastic, John Goodman simultaneously aggravating and charming, the dialogue so snappy and the one liners so quotable. Then there's the sort of soundtrack that filmmakers can assemble when they're at the top of their game and direction that doesn't intrude, except when it wants to.\n\nI hadn't seen this film for years, but there's so much going on I'm sure I could watch it again in a week and not be bored."

Now, I like a \"wicked good\" comedy along the lines the Farrelley Brothers make. That would not usually be a Coen brothers flick. Perhaps that why at this late date I've only now watched The Big Lebowski. It's the closest the Coen's may ever delve into a bit of Farrelley's territory. Is that good enough?\n\nIt starts out as \"The Stranger\" , who narrates mostly, introduces us to \"The Dude\". Now, \"The Stranger\" is obviously Sam Elliott he of such singular voice that when he tells you what's for dinner all vegetarians realize they've been idiots. But I digress. \"The Dude\", Jeff Lebowski is an \"ultimate slacker\". He's a walking theorem of energy conservation comfortable in his own skin...and bathrobe. It goes with scant explaining that he has no need for those things that you'd find in a Louis Vuitton boutique. He's uncomplicated his life down to his house shoes. Suddenly that is rudely interrupted by the inconvenient fact his real name, Jeffrey Lebowski, is scarred by a very wealthy man complete with empty vessel family members who have screwed others as these types do. These \"screwed others\" want theirs and in an act of identity crisis confuse \"The Dude\" with the wealthy Lebowski. A violation based on this mistaken identity ensues upsetting \"The Dude's\" uncomplicated existence. As such the rich Lebowski owes the poor Lebowski, at a minimum, a new rug (see movie for rug facts). And now for the celluloid version of a left turn at Albuquerque. It's quite a visual nutty ride. To make any sense of it there that other dude \"The Stranger\" who does a little summation at the end of this senseless story. Sometimes senseless is good enough."

The script is super well done, really, for me, the Cohen brothers and Tarantino are the best \"ordinary-dialogues-writers\" out there, is just fantastic how cool every single one of those lines are funny, or meaningful somehow.\n\nAnd I think that my favorite thing about the movie is this, it's super funny, I laugh my ass of through the entire movie, but is also one of those films that you can watch again, and every single time it is going to have a different meaning. It's like a \"thing\" of the Cohen brothers I guess, this is the same with Hail, Caesar! and (of course) No Country for old men. Is just fantastic those types of film, because isn't a movie that you need to see and pay attention to the details, an ordinary guy that just one to see one funny movie can watch this, and just have fun, but some crazy cinema fan (like us) can rewatch, and catch all the hidden things.\n\nThe soundtrack is terrific too.\n\nIn short, The Big Lebowski is a classic, one of the funniest movies I ever see, definitely worth your time."

It is written by the Coen brothers, who have wrote about a thousand great movies. Unfortunately they are dead now, but this movie is still alive. MY favorite thing about this movie, the reason why it gets 9 stars, every single line is mildly funny. Of course, you cannot laugh out loud at every single line, but you will find yourself giggling inside every time John Goodman opens his mouth. God, so funny. Watch this movie sober or not...your choice! Either way, funny as hell. At one point the Dude is tripping on a illicit substance...oh my god, the cinematography is amazing!!! The viewer is experiencing a TRIP in someone else's perspective. Very novel and unique. I watch this movie whenever I can with friends. You should do the same :)"

But The Dude's every other locution is the \"eff\" word!\n\nYes, but in chaotic times like the American 1990s, the forces of decency and love inevitably must be found in some pretty strange places, podner.\n\nTHE BIG LEBOWSKI is a romp whose chief goal is to make audiences laugh until they cry. However, along the way, the Great Themes all are broached: Love, Death, Greed, Perfidy, Betrayal, Forgiveness, Courage, Honesty, Ambition.\n\nI have watched LEBOWSKI merely four times, but I look forward to owning my own copy soon and watching it once a month. I've already memorized sections of dialogue. Flaubert said, \"Madame Bovary--c'est moi!\"; I am inclined to say \"The Dude--c'est moi!\"\n\nFor those whose minds and hearts align with those of the Coen Brothers, surely this is their crowning achievement to date. No scene rings false, and the parts all cohere, even though one must watch the film several times before every detail falls into place. This is a consummate work of picaresque art which becomes a kind of DON QUIXOTE before it's over: utter compassion and realism underlie the delicious absurdities.\n\nYe who have ears to hear: listen and laugh. This is as good as film gets at the turn of the millennium."

It concerns the adventures of \"The Dude\", an incredibly lazy hippie bowler with no aspirations who just can't stay out of trouble. As with all Coen films, the performances and writing are first rate, especially Jeff Bridges as \"The Dude\" and John Goodman as his violently unstable bowling partner. The humor is definitely not for everybody, but the people who don't like it will probably steer clear anyway. I'll just say you'll probably find yourself laughing for all the wrong reasons. I think we could all learn something from \"The Dude\" I learned that I really dig this movie and now I want to check out the other works in the Coen brothers' impressive catalog. 9/10"

        "review_title": "The Dude Sort of Abides",
        "review_detailed_main": "Spoiler alert: Some plot outcomes revealed.\n\nThe Dude abides, but Sam Elliot rules. Jeff Bridges is classic as the former, a pot-smoking do-nothing seeking payback for a urine-doused rug. The latter plays a mysterious cowboy-like character who chides Bridges' hapless bowler about his language but likes his style. Elliot is The Stranger.\n\nThe movie's theme is mistaken identity, the effect of drugs on less- than-normal people, and how clueless rich people can truly be. The flavor, flow and overall senseless meaning of the movie underscores what happens when you portray goofs and drug-users in conflict with money- minded wackos.\n\nThe shock-and-awe factor of this movie is not unlike Bad Grandpa, a 2013 send-up of a horny old grandfather featuring the star of Cable TV's Jackass show. Both movies are disjointed, purposefully themed to be off the wall, and are surprisingly funny.\n\nIn The Big Lebowski, Jeffrey Lebowski is a ne'er-do-well Los Angeles bowler who hangs out with his com-padre \"kegglers,\" Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and Donny, formally Theodore Donald Karabatsos (aka Steve Buscemi). Donny's an often-insightful dweeb who dies near movie's end. Walter's an angry, sort-of-Jewish convert who at one point produces a Colt .45 semi-automatic pistol from his bowling bag. You quickly realize none of these guys are playing with a full deck.\n\nThe Dude's brain is pot-fogged and White Russian soaked. Walter, at least, is capable enough to drive, but he mistakenly thinks he fought in Vietnam. And later he collects the then-deceased Donny's ashes in a coffee can, casting them into the wind near movie's end \u2013 and back on The Dude and him.\n\nSad to say The Dude Lebowski is mistaken by porno-movie collection apes for a very wealthy man by the same name. That would be The Big Lebowski, a condescending seeming 1-percenter yet handicapped war vet. He's played by character actor David Huddleston. Well-selected as his sycophantic servant Brandt is the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman.\n\nThe urine on The Dude Lebowski's apartment rug is dispersed evilly by a couple arm-twisting thugs owed money by the Big Lebowski's bimbo trophy wife. The Dude is angry, and goes to see his wealthy name-sharer seeking a new rug, or more correctly a handout for the wrongful retribution. Only in America would such a chance meeting end up in a job offer. Bunny Lebowski's (Tara Reid)being held for big money, but not really. Dude accepts the mission, recruiting his pals.\n\nIt truly is Bunny the wife who owes the porno mobsters money, not the wheelchair-bound war-hero millionaire Lebowski.\n\nThe Dude is tasked with paying ransom for Bunny, Big Lebowski's wayward and carefree wife. Along comes Donny and Walter for the ride, Goodman's guy complete with his skewed world view and free-floating hostility.\n\nYou know Big Lebowski's trophy wife is out of the kidnap plot when you see that one of the abductors is dumb enough to whack off a toe to add urgency to the fake scheme.\n\nThe three supposed heroes-turned-bag-men interrupt their bowling \"career\" to save Bunny. This includes a pin-slaying showdown between The Dude and Jesus Quantana (John Turturro). You know these dueling bowlers will meet again when Jesus implies that he will beat The Dude so badly that it will be like a forceful administration of anal sex.\n\nWhy? It's the whole prevalent drugs meets greed and silliness theme driven home with an 8-pound figurative sledgehammer.\n\nPortions of this movie are too bizarre to believe. (That's why I mentioned Sam Elliott, who rarely gets credit.) There's even an old-time psychedelic-rock interlude by Kenny Rogers and the First Edition: \"I Just Dropped In To See What Condition My Condition Was In.\" The song plays as the Dude floats down a dream-state bowling alley while spinning rotisserie style. He passes admiringly beneath the legs of skirted identically dressed comely females. No clear reason or plot tie. It's just done.\n\nThe angles, camera perspectives and even dialog are intended to underscore a pot-hazed plot. The Dude looks up from the floor at several points, flops over a chair in The Big Lebowski's office, and slurps White Russians. Walter has wild ideas about conspiracies. And Donny is always quieted with the same idiotic refrain: \"Shut the F-- up, Donny.\"\n\nThe Stranger says he likes The Dude's style, yet he also assails the White Russian-fueled Lebowski for a potty mouth. Say what? Head on camera shots, and Elliot's serious demeanor, add to the zany disconnected nature that prevails throughout as the movie's cult-fan theme. So does the quirkiness of all the other actors, especially Walter. Several times he has to be reminded that, no, he wasn't in Vietnam. \u0085 And Donny's rodent-like appearance lends credence to Buscemi's character.\n\nNear film's end, The Dude ends up in bed with a porn-movie producer and actress intent on becoming impregnated with his baby. Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore) is an acrobatic little minx whose relationship to any other Lebowski seems unclear.\n\nThe Big Lebowski is a movie with great potential, as long as you don't take any of it too seriously.\n\nBecause the point is: Life is short, don't over-analyze it, and enjoy. The Dude, as each of us, merely abides."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Coen brother's pessimistic view of the world, where its evilness, selfishness and hostility are soaked in the quirkiness and alacrity of daily life, is never better portrayed than in The Big Lebowski. Lebowski (not to be confused with that Mr. Lebowski), is one of the most interesting characters in cinema, a jobless drifter who has nothing going on with his life, mistakenly placed amongst people and a society that does not appreciate the beauty of his character. The film portrays a nihilistic view on life, a showcase of how meaningless life is, just like the drama and conflicts that unfolds in the story. The life Lebowski leads might not appeal to everyone, but we should all learn a thing or two from the the way he speaks, deeply rooted in a socially unacceptable philosophy that upon second thought yields more happiness than most. Why take life so seriously when deep down it is such a amorphous ridiculous mess that points nowhere? Do you agree with Lebowski? How can you apply his philosophies in real life where the stakes both smaller and higher than in Lebowski's fictional world of 90s LA? These are only a few of the questions this film inspire in its audience. In a weird way, The Big Lebowski makes for quite a touching film, and the way it does so is to make you reevaluate the attitude with which you lived your life until then. How is the truth about life, hidden in plain sight, so simple and yet so easily shunned?\n\nCoen brother's directorion and Deakin's cinematography are both highlights, but in this film I find the script and character study more intriguing. After all, it is what this film's enduring legacy is built on, and from which a cult following and even a so called religion engendered. The Coen's brothers eye for the folly of society and the frustrated human condition shines in this modern classic. They write dialogue that is rich with dark humor and subverts clich\u00e9s to deftly convey underlying messages. The Big Lebowski is another one of those definitive Coen films - subversive, funny, dark, thought provoking, perhaps even an exemplar at that. An endless revisitable film with so much character and a timeless message"

I mean, Walter Sobchak, you cant go wrong with a character like that. Especially when you cast John Goodman for the role. And Jesus. Don't forget about Jesus. Never have a character with so little screen time made such an impression. This may sound weird but John Turturro plays the best alleged rapist/self proclaimed bowling king there ever was. And he does it wearing a god damned hair net.\n\nI fall back on this movie when i'm sad, when i'm happy, when i'm alone or when i'm with friends. I always fall back on this movie. If i were to choose ONE movie to see for the rest of my life, this would be the one.\n\nPlus it always makes me wanna go bowling and get drunk on milk based drinks."

He made me laugh constantly throughout the movie. I always loved the Coen's work as it is just beautifully shot and conceived - always interesting without moving too far from the joy of the story. The Big Lebowski is my favourite Coen movie because it deals with a more common theme and is easy to relate to. Jeff Bridges character I could watch all day and sometimes I wish there could be a follow up movie. The story is full of superb characters and settings, whilst the soundtrack is excellent. Do yourself a favour and see this film."

In a couple of instances we even get to see The Dude's hallucinations and that's some next level stuff.\n\nThis absolute insanity and how the main characters deal with that mess make The Big Lebowski such a legendary comedy.\n\nThe Dude is larger than life, Coen's most iconic character. His daily routine includes goofing around, smoking weed and playing bowling. His attitude is inspiring and, besides all the jokes, provides food for thought. And he is in good company. Walter is always angry and ready to fight, as he suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a Vietnam veteran. Donny is a dumb but kind and innocent guy who gets the short end of the stick."

        "review_detailed_main": "Some scenes are a bit too absurd, preposterous, but \"The Big Lebowski\" abides. That being so, the Coen brothers simply say to their critics, \"such is life.\"\n\nTheir film is about exactly that - the absurdity of life in that no matter how much we try and take things into our own hands, do justice or make people claim responsibility for their actions, that life will often sucker-punch us out of left field.\n\n\"Lebowski\" is about a man of that name that goes by \"The Dude.\" He's a completely miserable, low-life character played by Jeff Bridges that for some reason you care about. As the Coen brothers are notorious for, The Dude gets caught up with some bad people for no reason other than he shares the same exact name as someone who happens to have money. When two guys break into his home thinking he is the other Lebowski and one pees on his rug, it all goes down hill from there for The Dude.\n\nWith a stellar supporting cast, led by John Goodman who is incredible in this film as The Dude's best bowling buddy and insane converted-Jewish Vietnam vet, \"Lebowski\" is original and deep-belly laughing funny. But not only that, the events of the film all say something important about when we choose to take action and when it might be best to let things be. The film's scenes are either funny and quotable, creepy and eerie or both. Usually both. All the gags, however, seem to have a point. If not in what their message is/how it contributes to the film, than at least in the way they grab your attention. Every scene in the film is effective in this way.\n\n\"Lebowski\" is undeniable proof that comedy can have a purpose other than mere entertainment. It is a film with purpose beyond humor. It is both strange, funny and meaningful. While not nearly as recognized or critically acclaimed as \"Fargo,\" per say, the effective combination that is so rare in film definitely warrants Coen brothers fans the rationale to say \"Lebowski\" is their best project."

The humor is strong, DoP Deakins does a great job but for me the star of the show is Jeff Bridges as The Dude. Never before or after did Bridges played a more memorable role. It is his performance that makes it an enjoyable film."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'll admit I am a big fan of this film; I've loved it since I first saw it on a grainy rental video back in 2000. To me the Coen brothers have made two outstanding films, this one and Fargo (1996), and yes, I know there will be some disagreement out there about that, but it's only my opinion. Now, before I tell you why I think this is such a great film, here's a little bit about the plot.\n\nJeffrey Lebowski (a.k.a. The Dude), is disturbed one evening when two heavies break into his house and demand money that his wife owes their boss. One of them urinates on his rug before they realise they have the wrong Lebowski\u0085 This one isn't even married. The next day The Dude complains about this to his bowling buddies, Walter Sobchak and Donny Kerabatsos. They figure out it's a case of mistaken identity and The Dude goes to see the man they really wanted, another Jeffrey Lebowski - The Big Lebowski, who happens to be a millionaire. Leaving with a replacement rug, The Dude meets the young trophy wife, Bunny Lebowski. A few days later he is contacted by Mr Lebowski's assistant, Brandt, because Bunny has been kidnapped and they want The Dude to act as the bag man. I won't say any more, but that's basically the set-up. Throw in The Big Lebowski's artist daughter Maude (from a previous marriage) and some crazy German nihilists and you can see there's plenty to keep the audience amused and entertained.\n\nThis is an exceptionally well made film with a great cast, a great score and some really different and enthralling dream sequences thrown in. To me it's almost the perfect movie, I say almost, because I like to leave a little margin for improvement. Great performances all round from; Jeff Bridges as Jeffrey Lebowski - The Dude, John Goodman as Walter Sobchak, Julianne Moore as Maude Lebowski, Steve Buscemi as Donny Kerabatsos, David Huddleston as Jeffrey Lebowski - The Big Lebowski, Philip Seymour Hoffman as Brandt and Tara Reid as Bunny Lebowski. Oh, and I almost forgot a stellar performance by John Turturro as Jesus Quintana.\n\nAs I've already said, this is, to me, almost the perfect movie. I say that because I can only find one scene that doesn't add anything substantial to the story. It's the one where The Dude confronts the guy in the VW Beetle (for those that have seen it). Apart from that, an almost perfect movie. Very highly recommended.\n\nMy score: 9.3/10"

The greatest thing about this film is the characters that are created. The Dude (Jeff Bridges) is one of the all-time great film creations. Walter (John Goodman), standing in stark contrast to the Dude's pacifism, is similarly brilliant. Steve Buscemi is funny in a minimalistic role as Donny, who is always one sentence behind everyone else. The Stranger (Sam Elliott) is a classic narrator, completely unrelated to the plot. Other unnecessary characters include the unnervingly funny Jesus (John Turturro) and the painfully awkward landlord Marty (one of the underappreciated moments in the film is his dance routine). Honestly, would the plot really be affected if the stranger, Donny, Jesus, Marty, Brandt, or Knox Harrington weren't in the film. What about the private detective at the end, or the fascist policeman. The plot need not be understood to enjoy the comedy gold of this film. I gave it the a ten on this website's ratings, and it is my personal favorite Coen brothers movie (right ahead of O Brother, Where Art Thou and Miller's Crossing)."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Coen brothers' The Big Lebowski is a friendly, clumsy comedy about a man named Jeff Lebowski, who calls himself the Dude, and is illustrated by the narrator as \"the laziest man in Los Angeles County.\" He lives merely to go bowling, but is taken for a millionaire named the Big Lebowski, with calamitous results. We all know people like the Dude, and so, supposedly, do the Coen brothers. They rooted the character in a producer named Jeff Dowd. Both dudes rely on lateral thinking much more than orderliness.\n\nThe Dude is paid a visit by two enforcers who obviously have the wrong Lebowski, but before they discover that, one has already peed on the Dude's rug, sparking intense hostility: \"That rug really tied the room together,\" the Dude laments. John Goodman's Walter Sobchak leads the vendetta. Sponging lines straight from Bush 41, he declares that \"this aggression will not stand\" and insists the Dude \"draw a line in the sand.\" The Dude drops in on the real Lebowski, leaves with one of his rugs, and soon finds himself solicited into the millionaire's conspiracies.\n\nRich Lebowski, wheelchair-bound like General Sternwood and staring into a fireplace like Major Amberson, wants the Dude to deliver his wife Bunny's ransom. This plot is countered by Maude, Lebowski's eccentric daughter from a past marriage. Julianne Moore, who played a porno actress in the great Boogie Nights, here plays a largely dissimilar sort of erotic artist, swathing herself in paint and launching herself through the air in a leather harness. L.A. in this film is a menagerie of idiosyncratic characters. One of the funniest is a Latino bowler named Jesus. The Dude is prone to lively fantasies when he's punched out or knocked unconscious, which occurs frequently, and one of them turns into a musical comedy set piece featuring a beautiful POV shot from within a bowling ball.\n\nThe Big Lebowski tears across all trajectories and never goes anywhere. That isn't so much a failing as its technique. The Dude, who rocks a lot of ganj,' swigs White Russians mixed with half-and-half, begins each day full of determination, but his devices steadily melt into a fog of lost chances and misconstrued intent. The atmosphere is set up right at first, when the narrator begins sufficiently well but ultimately admits he's lost his own gist, a droll curveball drawing our attention to the incidence of screenwriters who will never be unwilling to remove all support from us even after it has been literally soiled by a shaggy-dog-story character we may or may not ever see again in this chaotic plot.\n\nThis could never equal its predecessor Fargo, but it's bizarrely winning, like its hero, played by Jeff Bridges with a goatee, potbelly, ponytail and Bermuda shorts so bulky they may have been scrounged from his sounding board and bowling partner, Walter Sobchak. Their other teammate is Donny, who may not be too sharp-witted, but it's difficult to know as he's never permitted to finish a sentence. Set at the time of the Gulf War, here are characters whose language was created by earlier times, Vietnam, flower power and the Twilight Zone. As with Raising Arizona, The Big Lebowski shows us a protagonist whose doofus-y simplicity appears to be his sole defense from the real world. He and Walter's very idea of real life may be wrought by the narrow ways they have to express it. Bridges does more with his downcast physical expression than countless comics can manage by laying it on thick.\n\nFrom its opening credits, The Big Lebowski indeed appears and feels like a shuck-and-jive. That's why the recognizable premise of a staged kidnapping complete with betrayals is only outwardly commonplace. Crime and reason are not the concerns here. What matters is how hard-wearing the two or three characters we're most concerned for are, despite the misfortune generated by their own ineptness. The Big Lebowski---a surrealist farce cooked up by the unruly Coens out of odds and ends of the deep-rooted and the new-fangled, the philosophical and the primal, in a fraction of LA where heightened reality crashes with autistic character interaction---amounts to noticeably less than the sum of its frequently lively and entertaining parts."

Both were done by the Coen brothers and both were funny and strange at the same time. And both had roles in them for Steve Buscemi, who can make a good film great, a bad film good and a weird film watchable.\n\nI can't say I loved this film even though I'm giving it an 8 out of 10. But what I can say is that I really liked it. John Goodman and Jeff Bridges are so funny in this film. Goodman has issues. That's for sure. He has many issues that he is dealing with. But instead of dealing with them like a scarred Vet usually does, he deals with them in anger but a funny anger if that is possible. He lashes out at his friends especially Donny who just doesn't seem to say any of the right things when Goodman is around.\n\nBridges is excellent as well. His character really just wants to get through the day and bowl and not have anyone pee on his carpet. But of course none of that is going to happen in the strange world that the Coen's have created.\n\nWhat is not so great about this film is all the dream sequences. They are confusing and they don't hit the right note. They feel more like a nuisance.\n\nBut this is a film that should be experienced. It is at least original and it is worth a few laughs."

Their very special brand of humor and their weird characters make them an experience out of the ordinary.\n\nJeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is called \"The Dude\" by his friends. He's an aging hippie living the comfortable life mostly just bowling. However one day he is mistaken for the infinitely more ambitious Jeffrey Lebowski, an industrialist of considerable wealth. The mix-up leads to a set of events among including among other things German nihilists and kidnappings.\n\nYou have never seen Jeff Bridges like this before! I don't know what it is that the Coen brothers have, but they always seem to bring out the strangest things in the actors they use. Just look at John Goodman, as soon as he works with the Coens he shines like never before. Anyway, the very strange comedy that this movie presents is something that defies explanation. But i can say that i found it amazingly funny, well written and well played. And it's also a beautiful movie with high quality photography as well as cinematography.\n\nThis is probably the funniest movie that the Coen brothers have ever made, in competition with \"Arizona Junior\". A hysterical mix between weird characters, weird comedy and great film-making. A must-see. I rate it 7/10."

The story starts out with two henchmen breaking into the Dude's house (mistaking him for a man with a similar name) to collect a debt. Figuring out they had sought the wrong Lebowski, they leave a little reminder of the break in, namely they piss on his carpet (which held the room together). From here the movie takes some unexpectedly wild, yet quite comical turns. The Dude is usually surrounded by his buddies, Walter and Donny. Walter is a slightly unstable, Jewish (converted) ex-Vietnam veteran, while Donny is the proverbial 3rd wheel. This movie is just pure fun. I could not stop laughing the whole movie. The situations are just wild and the Dude's dealing with them is even better. I recommend watching this movie with friends, and with lots of Kahlua, Vodka and milk on hand (AHHHHH.

        "review_detailed_main": "The Big Lebowski is a comedy film directed by Jeff Bridges, starring Jeff Bridges as an L. A. loafer named \"The Dude\" and John Goodman and Steve Buscemi as his sidekicks. The film is set in Los Angeles and follows the Dude, who spends his days in his small abode, knocking back White Russians and getting ready for his next bowling-league tournament. When two brigands break into his dump, mistaken for Lebowski, and take a warning piss on one of his rugs, the Dude is befuddled and upset. Inspired by this incident, he seeks out Lebowski, a wheelchair-bound, bitter rich man, to get restitution for his rug. Lebowski, who is wheelchair-bound, has little patience for the Dude, but coincidentally, his trophy wife has disappeared and he receives a ransom note for his wife's disappearance. The Dude is enlisted to make the drop, with 20 grand in it for him. The Dude, a bowling buddy, struggles with his lack of ambition, leading to mishaps and a series of berserkos. The film features a diverse cast, including Bridges, Buscemi, and Reid, all tackling various forms of human screwups. Bridges' tenacious demeanor as the Vietnam veteran is explosive and funny, while Buscemi's befuddlement as the third Stooge adds a fitting Larry-like befuddlement. Tara Reid's performance as the trophy wife is also impressive. The film's screwy textures, from Carter Burwell's music to costume designer Mary Zophres' wiggy duds, make it a richly rancid enjoyment. The raucously rattletrap musical selections add a pungent quality to the delirium, and musical supervisor T-Bone Burnett is praised for the screwy selections in this big laugher. \"The Big Lebowski\" is a film about Jeff Lebowski's equanimity amidst vicissitudes, including kidnapping, ransom money, pornography, a millionaire, a runaway girl, and the Vietnam veterans and Flower Power disagreement. The film is narrated by The Stranger, who observes that the Dude Abides and hears there is a little Lebowski on the way. The Dude is denied matrimony and seems to have no women in his life, except by lucky chance. The film explores themes of equanimity, societal norms, and the importance of a roof over his head, fresh half-and-half for his White Russians, a little weed, and bowling buddies. The film highlights the importance of a man's attitude and the value of a roof over his head, despite the challenges he faces."

Not exactly the most intelligent mind on the planet. Yet he knows the exact street in North Hollywood where to find the In-N-Out burger (for those who are LA-challenged, North Hollywood is about 20 miles inland and worlds away from the beach). Makes you wonder if somewhere in that hazy melon of his he knows every location in LA County. Of course he knows this. It would be out of character if he didn't.\n\nAnd another:\n\nAt Jackie Treehorn's Malibu beach pad, Treehorn grills the half-baked Dude as to where Bunnie Lebowski might be. Suddenly the conversation is interrupted by a phone call and Jackie scrawls info on a pad while on the phone. We get the requisite zoom-in close-up as the Dude watches from across the room. Jackie excuses himself and exits. The Dude as Philip Marlowe rushes to the pad and lightly traces onto it. Instead of an address or any useful info about the aforementioned phone conversation, he instead traces a picture of an man, shall we say, standing at attention. Of course he does. Treehorn is the self-described \"publisher\" who created \"Logjammin'\"...what else did you expect to find on the pad?!\n\nNow I'll concede that events like this can not possibly sustain a film, and I think \"Lebowski\" was lambasted because it is a film not about story, but about a collection of characters. Funny characters. In fact, even the idea of taking a burn-out and dropping him in the middle of a convoluted Marlowe noir-like caper is enough to make me start laughing.\n\nYes, the language is crude. Yes, it sometimes feels like a collection of scenes strung together. I will say, however, this film is incredibly funny and hits the mark again and again."

In other words a case of, Love It or Hate It, with simply absolutely nothing else in between. Like Marmite the British savoury food spread.\n\nReviewers equating the Coen brothers with the meticulous Stanley Kubrick cannot possibly be taken seriously. Agreed, the Coens have made some good work but Kubrick has set a different level of cinematic standard that is simply hard to follow."

To me, it's a clever, fun, stoner comedy with a great cast and characters, but that's where it stops for me honestly.\n\nThe characters are very colorful, Jeff Bridges is perfectly cast as the Dude, an icon that is mercilessly cos played, and he is funny in the movie. John Goodman as former Vietnam lieutenant Walter Sobchak is a great backup for The Dude as he mostly plays the muscle for all the predicaments they get involved in. Steve Buschemi's character was good overall, even though he doesn't get much screen time. What's great is that even the small roles in the film who get one or two scenes, still make an big impact on the film in the few scenes they're in. I can't very well make a Big Lebowski review without mentioning Jesus, the bowler for an enemy team of the Dude's bowler team, excellently cast by John Turturro, one of my favorite Coen alumni. Others like Philip Seymour Hoffman and Julianne Moore are also quite entertaining for the few scenes they are in.\n\nWhen I first watched it, I thought the plot was very bloated, lots of scenes and subplots that really go nowhere. Even though it adds to some funny scenes, overall it doesn't amount to much, but oh well. Regardless of my small complaints with this movie, it's a very fun, well made film with some entertaining characters, with some slight editing issues. Solid nonetheless"

        "review_detailed_main": "Since I got the Big Lebowski on VHS several months ago, it's been in my VCR almost constantly. This rich, multi-layered comedy just seems to get better with each additional viewing--perhaps because no matter how hard you puzzle over the film, you'll never quite be able to understand everything about it at once. I equate The Big Lebowski to 12 Monkeys in that regard--both films are wildly entertaining on the surface, slightly ominous underneath, and have moments of pure genius throughout.\n\nEach of the Coens' films seems to be their take on a certain part of the country, in particular criminal activity gone awry in each area--with numerous references to their favorite movies thrown in. The Big Lebowski seems to take L.A. head-on and show us the city as something \"every bit as stupefying as in any of those other places\". If Fargo and The Big Sleep are combined with modern L.A., The Big Lebowski would be the result.\n\nJeff Bridges and John Goodman seem to be perfectly cast because their back-and-forth banter is hilarious. I actually can't think of a character that I would have cast differently--every character is memorable and thoroughly entertaining in its own way. The way they play off one another and affect the Dude's travels is just crazy. There is some really great writing in this film and the soundtrack is really great (especially the dream sequences). If you only watch the movie once, you're probably missing a lot of things.\n\nI tend to like movies that break \"conventions\", and this is definitely one of those films. The main characters aren't glamorous at all, the film's only sex scene is hilarious in contrast to the typical hollywood scene, and there isn't a coherent plot that can be outlined in a nice simple layout that everybody will understand. Just like the main characters, the film seems to bumble around aimlessly--but all the bumbling somehow resonates with coherence by the time it's all over.\n\nYou'll either love this movie or hate it. If you're offended by drug use (even though the film hardly glamorizes the use of drugs--it shows what happens to the \"Dude\" after years of drug abuse... he's an unemployed former Roadie for Metallica...) or profanity (I think this movie probably set the record for the use of the F-word--but it's always sort of melded into the conversation and you hardly even notice it after a while) this may not be the film for you. But I bet if you give The Big Lebowski a chance, it'll get under your skin."

It is blissfully bizarre and probably belongs up there with Altman's The Long Goodbye and Polanski's Chinatown as a wonderful snapshot of Los Angeles wrapped in a private-eye story. Again, it isn't a riddle to be solved, just movie entertainment at its best. The initial \"mystery\" of this story is about as important to the final film as the initial \"who stole the truck\" business in the beginning of The Usual Suspects. Forget about it and listen to the Dude sponging-up vocabulary, Walter chastizing pascifism, and poor Donny always six steps behind, out of his element. Like all the Coen Brother's films, this one gets better with repeat viewings to catch every nuance in performance, dialogue, cinematography, etc. Jeff Bridges gives his best performance since Fearless. Find out who has Walter's undies. You'll laugh to meet the man...parts, anyways."

        "review_detailed_main": "There are very few comedies made after 1960 that can make me chuckle, much less laugh out loud but The Big Lebowski is one of them. While I've owned the DVD and have seen this film many times I was able to catch a midnight showing last week at a local art house theater, and it was a hilarious experience. The high hilarity was enhanced by the crowd literally chanting the lines (or that could have been the White Russians we all drank were flowing as freely as water), and the audience's obvious appreciation for this clever film.\n\nWhile the Coen Brothers deserve a lot of the credit for the direction and the brilliant script, a special mention should be made regarding the performances. I would say that Jeff Bridges completely breaks from his `regular guy' type roles, but Lebowski *is* a regular guy, if you are a pot smoking, unambitious shlub. Both Bridges and John Goodman turn out performances that are so colorful and hilarious that their mere presence on the screen sparks laughter. The always fantastic Steve Buscemi also joins Goodman as a Coen Brothers repeat performer, and carries on the typical `Buscemi Coen Brother Character fate'.\n\nThis is a hilarious, surreal and brilliant film that should not be missed, especially if you are a fan of the Coen Brothers' work. It has been criticized by die hard fans and others for not falling into their typical genre, but all of the elements are the same, and while for me choosing a favorite Coen Brothers film is like choosing which child is one's favorite (it can't be done!) this is definitely one that I can watch repeatedly and not have it lose any of it's charm.\n\n--Shelly"

        "review_detailed_main": "One of those rare films that gets better with repeat viewings.\n\nAside from the hilarious writing and acting, we have a homage to every Marlowe/Archer/Sam Spade film every made. The young out of control wife, the rich old disabled husband, the eccentric strong minded daughter, the sinister pornographer, the beach town sheriff...\n\nThe premise of the film was: what would happen if you threw a man like the Dude into a typical L.A. film noir mystery? How would he cope? What would he do? Not much to base a film on, but it works.\n\nThroughout the film, Bridges in the character of the Dude drifts like a beach ball in a swimming pool, bouncing off the sides, going in different directions. Listen to what he says, recycling everyone else's thoughts and words. He is a mirror reflecting everything back.\n\nIn many ways, he is infantile. His \"beverage\" of choice is a sweet milky White Russian. He listens to a recordiing of a bowling game while immersed in his tub, a womb like scene. The Dude avoids pain and suffering, which means he avoids growing up.\n\nAh, the writing! In the beginning of the film, there is a scene in the bowling alley with Goodman, Bridges, and Buscemi discussing Bridge's problem. Those few minutes of dialogue are some of the funniest ever written, but the scene wouldn't work without the subtle acting and sharp timing.\n\nJohn Goodman owns the film; he takes his gift for comic acting to a new level. His character is full of rage and love -- he's a typical man. :)\n\nAlso rare in the film: every camera shot adds to the drama and meaning. It's a visual feast.\n\nThe Coen brothers scatter references and clues and jokes throughout the film -- only repeat viewings will show you the detail. Like the rug and the room, the Coens have really tied this movie together."

But I will give it this: This satiric tale of mistaken identity, kidnap and death has a Raymond Chandler-esquire feel that should certainly appeal to male viewers. Jeff Bridges is Dude Lebowski, who ends up being mixed up with a millionaire with the same last name (David Huddleston) who owes money to some very bad men. The Dude's best buddy, Walter (John Goodman) helps The Dude in his quest to find the senior Lebowski's hormone-crazed child bride (Tara Reid), who has done a disappearing act and may or may not have been kidnapped. The film is bizarre, to say the least, with Busby Berkley-type fantasy sequences, Bridges as a '60s burnout with long, unkempt hair and Goodman as an individual with serious anger management issues. Bridges and Goodman make the film worth watching, although their constant use of expletives may turn off some. They are supported in their efforts by Steve Buscemi as their strange pal Donny and Julianne Moore as the even stranger Maude Lebowski. Sam Elliott serves as the film's narrator and shows up in a brief sequence. This is quite probably Goodman's finest film, by the way."

The roles suite them so well, I doubt they will ever do better than they did here. Steve Buscemi is the only exception (he already gave his best in Fargo)\n\nUnfortunately, the Coen brothers never really recovered after the shock of making such an exquisite film and their later works are nowhere near as good. In fact I'd go as far as to say their film Intolerable Cruelty (2003) was a complete waste of effort, for maker and viewer alike.\n\nThere is however one emphatic point about the Big Lebowski: it is not universal humour. To really appreciate it, one has to be familiar with the American way of life or at least have a basic understanding of US history, contemporary culture, slang and so on. For example the ambiance of the \"bowling culture\", words like \"undude\", \"bummer\", \"jay\", \"ringer\" \"His Dudeness\"; Walter's (Goodman) constant struggle for people to respect his constitutional rights and the RULES etc.\n\nOverall I still have to say it is an evergreen classic, and a must see for everyone who believes they have a decent sense of humour and are not put off by a little cursing from time to time and let's face it: all the time."

Released in 1998, the film follows Jeff Bridges as Jeffrey \"The Dude\" Lebowski, an easygoing, bowling-loving slacker who gets entangled in a case of mistaken identity.\n\nBridges delivers a memorable performance as The Dude, perfectly embodying the laid-back, accidental hero with a penchant for White Russians. His interactions with John Goodman as the volatile Vietnam vet Walter and Steve Buscemi as the mild-mannered Donny are the heart of the film, offering a perfect balance of absurdity and humor.\n\nThe plot is a labyrinthine mix of intrigue and misunderstanding, inspired by the works of Raymond Chandler. It weaves through various Los Angeles subcultures, from avant-garde artists to nihilists, giving the film a rich, eclectic backdrop. The Coen Brothers' script is sharp and witty, filled with memorable lines and non-sequiturs that have become iconic.\n\nVisually, the film is a feast. The Coens' use of dream sequences is both bizarre and beautiful, showcasing their flair for creating visually stunning and thematically rich scenes. The cinematography and soundtrack further enhance the unique atmosphere, merging the film's various elements into a cohesive, engaging experience.\n\n\"The Big Lebowski\" is not just a film, but an experience. Its humor may not resonate with everyone, but for those it does, it's a hilarious, oddly philosophical journey. It's a film that rewards multiple viewings, each time revealing new layers and nuances. In short, it's a masterpiece of modern cinema that has rightly earned its cult status."

        "review_detailed_main": "There have been a few movies over time which have portrayed private eye characters that are quirky, or losers, or both ... but this one takes that concept out into left field and then keeps going into some completely unexplored area way beyond left field.\n\nJeff Bridges (\"the Dude\") and John Goodman are particularly brilliant in their roles of bowling buddies setting out to unsnarl a kidnapping fiasco. Goodman is well known for his comic talents, but everyone in this movie puts forth a full effort in displaying their craft exercised to the fullest. I laughed out loud at more lines and circumstances in \"The Big Lebowski\" than I have in a long time during a movie.\n\nThere are bizarre circumstances, absurd conversations, acid flashbacks, and entire characters that you may decide aren't really there. I anticipated the \"punch line\" in the strange little funeral that Jeff and John held for their friend, and still had a tummy holding laughing jag when it arrived. I had somehow missed this movie for quite some time, so I am certainly glad I finally watched it. If you are a fan of offbeat, irreverent comedies and haven't caught this yet, this time is nigh! Warning, after this movie you may experience strange sub-conscious desires to drink white russians and go bowling."

The development of the characters \"The Dude\" and Walter is just out of this world, Jeff Bridges and John Goodman simply bring them to life. The story might be a little complicated to understand at first. The real treasure is in the details, on how The dude takes a bath while listening to the whale sing or how Walter has to relate everything to the war in Vietnam because of his post traumatic stress dissorder, and all the events happening also related to the invasion in Kuwait. This movie is too real. I give it 9 starts. Hope you enjoy it"

        "review_detailed_main": "After the darkly surreal, snowswept landscapes of the Minnesota depicted in Fargo (1996), the Coen brothers have wisely opted for a different locale with The Big Lebowski. Set in Los Angeles (circa 1991 at the height of the Persian Gulf War), this effort from the inventive duo is a whimsical tale about a man known as The Dude.\n\nJeff `The Dude' Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is a laid-back kinda guy, an aging Hippie who spends his days drinking White Russians, smoking pot, and bowling with his buddies. One day, this all changes when two thugs invade his home, rough him up, and urinate on his rug. It seems that they have The Dude confused with another Lebowski, a rich millionaire whose young wife owes money all over town.\n\nBummed at having his prized rug ruined, The Dude decides to contact the other Lebowski and in doing so becomes immersed in a very strange, convoluted plot that involves nihilists, a kidnapping, Busby Berkley dream sequences, British performance artists, and bowling.\n\nSound a little strange? It's all par for the course with the Coen brothers, a clever filmmaking duo that loves tweaking existing genres to the point that they become something very different and distinctly Coenesque.\n\nThis includes fully-realized characters, both major and minor, that have their own unique habits and mannerisms. Most films do not take the time to flesh out their respective worlds or the characters that live in them but this is not the case with the Coens.\n\nThe Big Lebowski presents a world rich in detail and atmosphere and is subsequently populated by often a humourous and sometimes bizarre collection of characters that range from an obnoxiously narcissistic bowler named Jesus (John Turturro) to Walter Sobchak (John Goodman), The Dude's loyal bowling buddy who just happens to be a Vietnam vet with a short fuse.\n\nThe cast do a great job in supporting the main character, played wonderfully by Jeff Bridges. He creates mannerisms and habits that flesh out his character perfectly. From the first time we see him, Bridges is The Dude. And even though he is a down-and-out loser, there is something undeniably likable about him, and this is due in large part to Bridges' performance.\n\nFrom start to finish, The Big Lebowski is an engaging comedy that is very entertaining and a lot of fun to watch. It is a visual feast for the eyes -- in particular, The Dude's dream sequences which are simultaneously hilarious and breathtaking. This is the Coens in top form.\n\nThe Big Lebowski may not have the dramatic weight or substance of Fargo, but it has a distinctive charm uniquely its own. The joy of this film is in watching all the entertaining diversions, subplots and minor characters and how The Dude interacts with them all. You are not supposed to really care about what happens to the convoluted storyline or how it is resolved. That is merely window-dressing for the Coens to showcase this highly engaging world they've created. The Big Lebowski is definitely worth the trip."

The Dude is a truly inspired creation -- as far from your standard-issue hero as you'll ever find. In fact, to be blunt, he's a lazy, drug-addled, feeble slob. But his heart is good, his instincts true, and his shuffling persistence in the pursuit of justice is a wonder to behold.\n\nAs usual, the Coens' regular supporting cast of loonies is perfection, with co-star John Goodman a standout as the John Milius-inspired Vietnam vet with a chip on his shoulder the size of Gibraltar.\n\nThe plot doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense, with many bizarre stops along the way, weird bits of business, oddball musical fantasy interludes and bursts of manic action that will most assuredly test the attention spans of the straightlaced and unimaginative. But if you loosen up and go with the flow, in the laidback manner of The Dude himself, you could find yourself having a lot of fun."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've never had a roommate who didn't like \"The Big Lebowski.\" It is quite simply a perfect film to watch with friends. It's funny, fluffy, and it goes down really well with the mind-altering substance of your choice.\n\nBizarrely, this now-classic film hit the theaters like a beached whale; it barely recouped its costs, and was generally regarded as a lightweight followup to the Coen brothers' acclaimed \"Fargo.\" I can see why people were disappointed, actually. \"Fargo\" is a tightly plotted thriller, and \"Lebowski\" is shamelessly meandering lunacy. But both films are masterpieces in their own ways.\n\nWhat's so great about this movie, then? Without sounding too pretentious, I'd like to submit the theory that it captures the rhythms of modern, everyday life. Think about it. We all have stupid hobbies and annoying friends, we'd all rather get trashed than work, and we'd all be pretty hopeless morons if we were suddenly plunked into the middle of a tortuously complex film noir plot. That's the genius of \"The Big Lebowski\"; it puts the average schmuck into a Chandleresque world of intrigue, and the results are hilarious, in a rather strange way.\n\nI know lots of people who think this is the best comedy ever made, and I'm almost on board with that - Walter alone propels the film to greatness - but in the end, \"The Big Lebowski\" is just slightly too strange for me to wholly embrace. Oh, it's great, four stars all the way kind of stuff, but after I watch a \"deeper\" comedy like \"The Odd Couple\" I feel more fulfilled, more enlightened about the human condition. After I watch \"The Big Lebowski,\" I feel...silly.\n\nBut silly is good, when you're in the mood."

        "review_detailed_main": "I finally broke down and bought this movie because of all the glowing reviews I'd read here about it. Surely a movie so many people liked and waxed lyrical about would be worth owning. The first time I watched it, I got to the dude's second encounter with Maude and turned it off just annoyed by the film. I watched it again and made it through to the end a few days later.\n\nI've only seen three Coen brother films, Raising Arizona (mostly hated it), Fargo (mostly loved it) and this one (still trying to decide). One thing you can say about the Coen brother's films is that they are complex. This one is somewhat of an homage to Raymond Chandler's LA based Philip Marlowe mysteries. I happen to love Raymand Chandler's works and consider him one of the most brilliant authors of the 20th century, so am somewhat disappointed by the Coen brother's thievery (their characterization, not mine) of his style.\n\nThe Dude, like Chandler's Marlowe get's caught up in a web of intrigue and runs around LA meeting mostly unsavory characters that you can't begin to like. Marlowe himself is somewhat unlikeable, but not as unlikeable as the Dude. At least Marlowe is working while the Dude is motivated by primarily his own greed, first in wanting to obtain a new carpet for free, and secondly by increasing offers of money from the other Lebowski and the other Lebowski's daughter Maude.\n\nBut if the Dude is unlikeable, most of the other characters are even less likable. John Goodman as Walter, is especially annoying, and most of his scenes are played out so over the top to be totally unbelievable. Most of the other reviewers talk about how \"realistic\" the conversations between Walter and the Dude are, yet gullibly laugh at Walter throwing himself out of a moving car with an Uzi wrapped in bubble wrap to go try to catch a kidnapper to beat the truth out of.\n\nDonnie is probably the most likable of the three friends, or at least maybe you feel most sorry for, as he is continually told to shut up by Walter. At least Donnie gets one of the most memorable lines of the movie when the Dude and Walter are talking about something that Lenin said and Donnie interjects, \"I am the Walrus?\" Of course the Coen brothers for no discernible reason kill Donnie off at the end of the movie.\n\nI don't know why the Coen brothers felt they needed Sam Elliot in this movie, but I liked it as a nice touch of surrealism. I didn't like the dream sequences very much, especially the second one. I also found the German nihilists very insultingly portrayed, kind of along the same lines as how the Germans in Hogans Heroes were portrayed. I'd expect better from the Coen's they are smarter than that.\n\nThe film wasn't totally worthless, I did laugh out loud at points (the In and Out Burger fixation was hilarious, as was the 2X4 nailed to the floor as a doorstop that the Dude later trips over, for a couple of examples), but there were as many things that I found just downright annoying about the film as well.\n\nFar from a masterpiece, it's a badly flawed, albeit, amusing film."

When you think it can't get any weirder (unless you go see \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\") wait until Jesus starts to bowl. Now you may not like bowling but that's of no consequence because \"new things will come to light\" when you keep watching, things like beverages of a certain kind, rugs, toes, scribbled notes, car stolen, car found, a baseball bat, money lost, the Eagles, thorough doctors, sex, not necessarily in that order.\n\nThe dream sequences are yet another part of this movie which in itself would be totally cheesy and boring for anyone to watch, but this time around it's the dude and you fly along with him. No questions asked.\n\nOne cannot help but wonder though how the dude makes a living besides playing courier for ransom money? Maybe he acts as a jury for his landlord's dancing performances? Who knows? It's beside the point. The dude does what the dude does: Nothing, but that he does exceedingly well.\n\n8/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "As guys, we've all been through this Bohemian times, where we could keep the same underwear for the week, and bed sheets for the month, when the toilet seat could be left open and we could do whatever we wanted in the bathtub without a nagging female voice interrupting our meditation. But now that we settled down, it's with nostalgic eyes that we remember the time we could be guys in the lousiest and laziest meaning of the world, and venerate the one who made this attitude a lifestyle, a state of mind, a philosophy. His name is Jeff Lebowksy aka the Dude, a name fittingly rhyming with attitude, and he's played by the namesake Bridges in the signature role his career much needed.\n\nIndeed, who needs motives, personal backgrounds, goals and all that screen writing hogwash when you have an attitude. The attitude makes the characters who make the film, and that's the way the Coen brothers have it with \"The Big Lebowski\", bizarrely overlooked at the time of its release, but whose brilliance blossomed in our minds after we got rid of all our preconceived cinematic notions and started to appreciate the laziest character of L.A. But while the Californian urban landscape is integral to the film's 'narrative', I think every man in a way or another can relate to the Dude, starting with his appearance. Basically, he looks like a bum, with his long leonine hair, his shaggy goatee, his Bermudas shorts, flip-flops and bathrobes, but here's a guy who (obviously) is the antithesis of the metro-sexual figure, and that's enough a reason to love him.\n\nWhat matters for the Dude is to go bowling with his team: Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and Donnie (Steve Buscemi) and enjoying a White Russian cocktail. Walter is a Nam vet and the kind of friends that make you wish for enemies, and Donnie is the space filler who can't align three sentences before being told to 'shut the **** up\". You think it's crazy to hang out with such guys? I have a friend like Walter, and no matter how much of a bastard he could be, we 'forgot about it' while playing pool. Bowling, pool or poker, the point is that if guys were given the opportunity, they would pick fun and idleness as ways of life. And if it was up to the Dude, there would be no plot, two guys could beat and water-board him, he'd let them go the minute they knew it was the wrong Lebowski, but one committed a mistake, he peed on the rug, the one that \"tied the room together\".\n\nThe film is set during the Gulf War, so when he shares his misadventure, Walter paraphrases Bush Sr. and tells the Dude that they crossed the line and he's entitled to demand reparation. If the Dude is the extreme of men's capability to live without rules, Walter is the total opposite and can't envision life without a sense of ethos. He can't play on the Shabbat day even though he's not Jewish, but like he says, just because he divorced from his Jewish wife doesn't mean he should give back the library card. Walter is so wrapped up in his self-righteousness (he point a gun on a player who can't admit he crossed the line) that he's the one who makes the plot move forward, much to the Dude's annoyance. Goodman is the Laurel to Bridges' Hardy and you can't count how many times the Dude realizes the nice mess, he's been gotten into. And the mess all starts with the 'rug' situation.\n\nSo, the Dude complains to the Big Lebowski (the late David Huddleston) a tycoon who incarnates the American capitalist dream, and except for his legs, lost in Korea, he has everything: money, power, influence a philanthropic foundation and Bunny, a trophy wife played by Tara Reid. The Big Lebowski throws the 'little' one out of his office, but the Dude tells his spineless assistant (played by the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) that his boss agreed to leave him a rug as compensation. And as far as he was concerned, all was well that ended well for the Dude, and he could focus on the next game with Jesus Quintana, a Hispanic Bowling champ played by the Coen regular Tarantino. Quintana makes quite an impression when he's introduced but the feeling is immediately (and hilariously) contradicted by the little back-story detail Walter provides.\n\nBut we won't have much of Quintana, because there's more going plot=wise, Bunny is kidnapped, his worried husband hires the Dude as a negotiator, and Maude Lebowski, his daughter (Julianne Moore) takes the rug back (and many other things I wouldn't spoil) . Many critics point out the fact that there's not a real plot, and it doesn't matter, even the narrator (mustached legend Sam Elliott reckoned he's lost his train of thoughts) but I think there's one identifiable pattern in the Big Lebowski, the characters have an attitude, which means, they believe in something tangible. The Dude believed in bowling, Walter in bowling and ethos, Donnie in his friends, the Big Lebowski in principles, his assistant in the Big Lebowski\u0085 so it's all natural that the closest to villains in the film would be nihilists. It's one thing to do nothing but being driven by nothing is beyond reason.\n\nAnd for all the mess, the Dude and Walter go through, they remains true to their nature and this contrast makes their interaction and situations so damn hilarious, I understand the film needed some musical interludes to let us catch our breath, one of them providing an unforgettable POV shot from within a rolling bowling ball. When knocked up, the Dude only cares for bowling, more than a game, a defining metaphor for the man who slowly rolls over the lane of life. The film also ends on a pure metaphor, because, in bowling terms, \"The Big Lebowski\" is a strike!"

The characters were boring, the plot was uninspired, and the sense of humor was irritating and pretentious (I guess I'm the only one that doesn't think boring dialogue about ice and snow between cops at a murder scene is laugh-out-loud hilarious). The Big Lebowski, however, is ten times the movie Fargo is.\n\nThe characters are just great. Even minor characters get special quirks that make them far more interesting than the major characters in most recent movies. And the protagonist, Jeff \"The Dude\" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), is the kind of guy who wanders down to the supermarket in his bathrobe at night to write a 69 cent check for a carton of milk. I'm tired of boring, ridiculously one-dimensional main characters who get close-ups every other second while using lines like, \"I'm not going back without my men!\" The Dude is an unlikely hero if there ever was one, and that is why he is a most refreshing and memorable one. There's The Dude's best friend Walter (John Goodman), a well-read and impulsive Vietnam vet; Jesus, the purple -clad sex offender/bowler; Maude Lebowski(Juliane Moore), the feminist artist who speaks of \"coitus\"; and a crazed group of ideologically-confused nihilists, among so many other great characters. The dialogue is priceless.\n\nThe plot is very unique and ridiculous, but it fits the movie absolutely perfectly. The Dude and Walter get involved in a shady world of kidnapping , embezzlement, porn, reactionary cops, and just about everything else, when all the Dude ever wanted was compensation for a rug of his that had been urinated on by confused debt collectors who were looking for a different man also named Jeff Lebowski.\n\nThere are so many great little touches in this movie. The Dude's dream /blackout sequences are hilarious (complete with Saddam Hussein handing out bowling shoes and bowling combined with porn imagery). The script is very clever and the movie as a whole is an incredible experience. The best part of The Big Lebowski is how strangely wonderful the whole thing is; don 't expect most moronic movie critics to understand it. In a perfect world, The Big Lebowski would be in the AFI's Top 100 instead of Fargo. It's the type of movie you never want to end."

They seem to be feeling a bit left out by the vibe, humour, storyline and characters. They just don't seem to get the whole dude, hippy perspective of the world and his current situation. The don't get the nihilists, the loose cannon/ outspoken viet vet, Donny the much ignored bowling friend that the Dude and Walter know almost nothing about....anyway, it seems that a bit of background generation knowledge is required to enjoy this movie. Always will be a unique classic in my book."

I was really impressed with every aspect of the movie. Some have enjoyed Fargo better then The Big L. but I don't think so. I know that the Coen brothers set out to make a movie like no other and I feel like they have. The movie didn't make me fall off my seat with laughter until I really thought about it for several days. It took several viewings of the movie to catch everything that was going on. I had to purchase a video so I could save money at the video store! Each viewing revealed yet another detail that was missed previously. It's not everyday that you find a comedy that really makes you think as well as laugh. Congrats to the Coen brothers for making a masterpiece like The Big Lebowski, my new favorite movie (old being Goodfellas)."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Big Lebowski is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific cast. With it's very goofy set up and even its characters, you wouldn't expect very big performances from the cast, but they all deliver superb acting, they were all taking a huge risk with this very unusual film, and they ended up making a good choice. My favourite scenes are definitely any one between Jeff Bridges and John Goodman, the chemistry between the two of them is terrific, they both play very unique characters, nothing like any of their previous roles. It's definitely longer than it needs to be, it's nearly too hours long, and with the story being as ridiculous as it is, this can get a little bit tiring after a while, but it is mostly entertaining and hilarious throughout. Very different and packs in plenty of laughs, I would recommend the Big Lebowski to anyone looking for a good comedy.\n\nA man must cope with being mistaken from a millionaire who owes a lot of money, and receives the help of his bowling buddies to seek revenge.\n\nBest Performance: Jeff Bridges Worst Performance: Tara Reid"

John Goodman plays a major screw-up , totally unbelievable that someone could be THAT stupid.\n\nThe character played by Sam Elliot should be ashamed calling \"Dude\" a hero, a \"man for our times\". In the times we live in where the world is \"going to hell in a handbasket\", we need not immortalize a character who is a dope smoking, booze swilling, careless, jobless, wreck as a hero. The Coen brothers need to get out of their Hollywierd environment and get a grip on what's real in our society.\n\nThe fantasy scenes with Dude flying through the air and the bowling sequence are interesting, and point out the best thing you can say about this movie - someone must have been on drugs who created it."

        "review_detailed_main": "I had a professor in college that used to always tell us, \"the world needs more bowling leagues.\" It was a strange thing to say, I thought, in an Intro to American Politics class. This professor gave us the example of when he was in graduate school he and his wife joined a bowling league in their town. He said that it was a great way to meet new people whom you may have never otherwise thought of spending time with. He said that our society needed to relearn those social skills. After every viewing of \"The Big Lebowski\" I think back to this professor's recommendation to join a bowling league.\n\n\"The Big Lebowski\" was always one of those films that was recommended to me to be included on my list of movies that I should see before I die. While I had already seen a fair number of Coen Brothers films, I was still a little hesitant to watch this one. I finally gave it a chance one rainy afternoon. I have to admit, the first time I watched it I thought to myself, \"what did I just watch?\" I laughed a lot, yes, but I couldn't wrap my head around it. As with many films I watch, I let it simmer in my brain for a while.\n\nA few months later I gave the movie a second chance. This time, at the end of the movie, I realized that I had just seen a piece of art. Every subsequent viewing I find that I like it more and more. In my opinion, it is the best performance by Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, and Steve Buscemi of their entire careers. While I don't usually describe it as my all-time favorite movie, I have recently been coming back to this movie when in conversations with friends about truly great movies. I tell people to have patience with it. Don't expect to be satisfied with the ending...right away, at least. \"The Big Lebowski\" has aged extremely well, too. I feel it is even better now than when it was first released. In our era of instant gratification and social media, we need a movie like this. We need to join more bowling leagues."

        "review_detailed_main": "There are so many movies that lack in originality, and there are so many comedies that fall flat. \"The Big Lebowski\" is like an answer to my prayers. This is a comedy that works in ALL aspects. Sometimes you have a comedy that's funny, but the writing's terrible and the talented cast is pretty much the only asset that keeps it moving. This movie not only has a great cast, but it's wonderfully written (by those genius Coen Brothers), lavishly directed and contains a remarkable soundtrack. Each and every character has a quirky, notable personality. My favorite, though he only appeared on screen for about 5 minutes, was Jesus Quintana (played masterfully by John Turturro). He cracked me up so hard!!! And I love that scene where Jesus goes up to bowl, licks the ball for good luck and we watch in slow-motion as he hits a strike. He dances in the lane and rejoices, while we hear a Mariachi version of the famous \"Hotel California\" in the background. Only the Coen Brothers can make a scene work that smoothly. There are other memorable sequences, like the musical number called \"Gutterballs\" with Jeff Bridges being handed a pair of bowling shoes by Sadam Hussein and flying under the skirts of beautiful women. You watch a scene like that, and you wonder why this movie didn't nab an Oscar for Best Art Direction.\n\nEthan and Joel Coen have a great sense of originality, and that also showed in their other hilarious comedy, \"Raising Arizona.\" I loved that movie, too. But I loved this movie twice as much. Some won't approve of its maximum dosage of \"f\" words, but I was laughing so hard that didn't bother me one bit. \"The Big Lebowski\" is one of those flicks that shows you what comedy is all about, and how to really form a good punchline with perfect timing and delivery. As a bonus, the film is packed with stunning visuals. It's such a great movie to look at. There are no cheap shots in this one. The dialogue is imaginative, yet realistic. It's not the least bit pretentious. You know, as you watch this, that this IS the way people talk. And that was also shown in \"Fargo.\" And I liked that even though the central character was a simple-minded individual, they didn't construct him like someone out of a \"Bill and Ted\" movie. Jeff Bridges, who is perfectly cast, was extremely entertaining and I can say the same about John Goodman as his easily-angered friend who follows all the Jewish holidays even though he's not Jewish.\n\nI find it a tad appalling that critics have panned this movie and called it slight and forgettable. This is more intelligent than most comedies in recent years--or any year. This is a very, very entertaining movie and if you really want to laugh--this is DEFINITELY the movie to see!!!"

There are just TOO many quotable catch phrases and memorable lines of dialogue to mention - I'm sure other reviewers will point them out. Jeff Bridges plays a convincing White Russian- drinking stoner to perfection and John Goodman (a Coen brothers staple) is the main f-bomb-dropping perpetrator, with John Torturro (another Coen bros favorite) showing a true love for his bowling ball. A riot. Phillip Seymour Hoffman has a delightful sort-of cameo as well, especially in his reaction to \"Bunny\" making a suggestive offer to \"The Dude\" Bridges. Watch and laugh your \"f'in' head off, but with adults only. This deserves and has attained a well-regarded comedy cult status. Miss you, PSH."

But in all seriousness, this movie revolves around the misfortune(s) of Lebowski: a lovable passive man who just wants to enjoy life, but is put in a whirlwind instead.\n\nFrom the bowling alleys to the bridges, going on this adventure is constant excitement and joy. You can't help but smile to see the Dude take what life has to throw at him in the best way he can. Lebowski is quite the man, and this movie's highs (literally) and lows certainly prove it is more than just another dull comedy.\n\nWatching this movie even after hearing about all its reviews, I was still quite impressed in every aspect of the film. Whether it just be scenes of playing at the lanes, or taking a relaxing drive outside, I can't overemphasize how much I enjoyed this film. I highly recommend The Big Lebowski since I'm sure it will put a smile on your face...and even give you a little something to think about."

Every character in it has a unique charm, and despite the fact that they are all pretty much cartoonish caricatures, they all somehow have depth, and the interplay among them is just priceless.

Maybe because this was my first Coen/Coen movie it hit me hard.\n\nDude Lebowski is so lazy that at certain points he can't even think what to say so he copies what George Bush says ,or writes a check for less than a dollar..?\n\nThis movie in a way makes fun of Jews , Italians , Poles , Germans ,Swedes ,Greeks , Mexicans but not in a vulgar way .\n\nI really loved the attitude 'the dude ' had when someone broke into his house smashing the door while he was smoking pot in his bathtub ...' hey this is a private apartment ..' Or the fact that he drank everyday about at least 3 white russians.\n\nThen in comes Sobczak , the dude's buddy and bowl mate .This guy is absolutely played fabulously by John Goodman . He is so fixated about rules and these 'rules' have been fought for by himself and so many other ' good guys ..in Nam ' . This fixation is so strong that at a certain point he points a gun at a bowling contestant because he went ' over the line ' but claimed otherwise .Or the fact that he argues with ' autobahn ' nihilists that ' these are not the rules ! ...without a hostage there is no ransom '.\n\nAnyway simply the idea of introducing a character like Sobczak who is a pole who was in Vietnam , lives in the states and pretends he's Jewish (because his ex-wife was ) but really is a catholic is absolutely hilarious to me..\n\nAll the characters in this movie are worth mentioning but space runs out !\n\nI'd conclude that this movie is a rare type of low budget , non-Hollywood-mega-project movie that to me is at a higher level than many action-packed , super-fx ,multimillionaire movies that are coming out these days . I'll certainly look out for more Coen movies..."

        "review_detailed_main": "I, usually, don't watch the same movie several times. However, The Big Lebowski is a big exception to that rule. Very loosely based on real people and stories, this movie is full of details, subtle references and jokes. In fact, it's impossible to catch them all in just one viewing. Every time I watch this masterpiece, I always find something new. Thus, the Big Lebowski has the biggest re-watch value I've ever seen in a movie. Another astonishing thing is that almost all of the dialogue in the movie (besides one sentence that was ad-libbed) was written in the script. Which is fascinating since the F-word or a variation of the F-word is used 292 times; the word \"dude\" is used around 161 times and The Dude says the word 'man' 147 times through the movie. With these two elements in mind, there is no doubt that the Coen brothers are absolutely marvelous screenwriters. And The Big Lebowski is their best movie to date.\n\nThe Big Lebowski is a movie about an everyday lazy hippie-like guy named Jeffrey Lebowski aka The Dude. His misfortune starts when two thugs, mistaking him for another man, also named Jeffrey Lebowski and who is a millionaire, enter his house and try to extort money from him. They also pee on his rug. When they eventually realise they entered the wrong house, they just pick up and leave. The Dude, furious about his rug being destroyed, decides to take the whole situation to the millionaire Lebowski. From this moment on, one complication after another erupts. And the Dude gets involved in all kind of activities. The movie's narration is very film noir-esque: the movie follows the Dude in every scene and he serves as the audience's guide through the story. As a matter of fact, the movie's plot and characters somewhat follow the classic novel/movie The Big Sleep.\n\nSince the movie's plot, just like the one from The Big Sleep, can get complicated from time to time, one may find oneself, during the first viewing, in a position where trying to follow every subplot means missing the small details that make this movie so perfect. Not that it is wrong, but in order to fully appreciate the appeal of The Big Lebowski, repeated viewings are an absolute necessary; especially since The Big Lebowski is ultimately a comedy and much of the humour is in the details. The characters also a very strong aspect of the movie. There is plenty of them and each and everyone is memorable and great. Like I said before, the characters, and some of the situations they get into, are based on real life people (and their stories) the Coen brothers met in their lifetime. This unusual combination of real life absurd situations and film noir structure is what makes The Big Lebowski so unique and enjoyable.\n\nThe Big Lebowski really has a cult status, it is generally adored by both critics and the audience. It even has its own multy-city festival, Lebowski fest. It can easily be found on most of the best comedies of all time lists. It also spawned one of my favourite soundtrack albums (featuring names like Bob Dylan, Kenny Rogers, Captain Beefheart and Elvis Costello, among others). Speaking of music, the bassist of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Flea, also has a role in the movie. And The Big Lebowski features a fictional German electro band named Autobahn, which is clearly a homage to Kraftwerk \u2013 I found that to be a really nice touch. The only problem I have with the movie is the opening narration by Sam Elliott, which seems too pointless and long and it never suited me. Besides that, everything is top notch. It's a definite recommendation. Now if you would excuse me, I have to go make myself a White Russian.\n\nRating: 9/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/"

And Steve Buscemi's character, Donny, is very funny as the innocent victim of Goodman's temper. I can not picture any other actors playing these characters, or the other characters for that matter. The Big Lebowski has an excellent plot, something that most comedies seem to lack. This is a must see movie that will have you repeating some quotes from the film to your friends on a regular basis.

        "review_detailed_main": "If Fargo is the highest point in the Coen brothers' filmography, The Big Lebowski comes in a close second: it's a perfect hybrid of fun, mystery, irony and pure insanity, Joel and Ethan's most explicitly entertaining movie since Raising Arizona, and by far more accomplished.\n\nThe plot, loosely based on Raymond Chandler's works (the title itself is an obvious pastiche of The Big Sleep), revolves around a former hippie, Jeffrey Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), who insists everyone refer to him as The Dude or, in extreme cases, something like His Dudeness or El Duderino. To call The Dude an underachiever is a euphemism: he's never achieved anything, in fact he spends his days doing nothing besides smoking marijuana, drinking White Russians or bowling with his \"friends\" Walter (John Goodman), a Vietnam veteran with a life philosophy like no one else, and Donnie (Steve Buscemi), who isn't actually allowed to do much since everyone constantly asks him to \"shut the f*ck up\" (whereas in Fargo it was impossible to prevent him from talking).\n\nThe Dude's quiet existence is radically shaken up when he is assaulted for no reason by two men who even take the liberty of peeing on his rug. As it turns out, they mistook him for another Jeffrey Lebowski, the one mentioned in the title, a wheelchair-bound millionaire whose young wife (Tara Reid) appears to have been kidnapped by a band of Nihilists (led by Peter Stormare). Add a sleazy pornographer (Ben Gazzara), the other Lebowski's artist daughter Maude (Julianne Moore), the mysterious stranger (Sam Elliott) whose voice occasionally comments on the story, a child-molesting bowling champion (John Turturro) named Jesus (\"That's right! Nobody f*cks with the Jesus!\"), some freaky dream sequences and several mix-ups and it's no longer very surprising that The Dude needs absurd quantities of booze and pot to accept what's happening to him.\n\nAs a matter of fact, what happens is actually the least interesting aspect of the film: the noirish premise is nothing but a MacGuffin, a cheap yet brilliant excuse to make all those wonderful characters interact with the Coens' trademark exquisite dialogue, the best lines coming out of Goodman's mouth (\"This is what happens when you f*ck a stranger in the ass!\"). The fine ensemble cast gives life to a singular group of pederasts, pimps, private investigators and slackers, above whom Bridges towers with a humanity that makes you want to hug him on the spot. The Dude, a revolutionary at heart even when there seems to be nothing left to fight for, is the brothers' most relatable and endearing creation next to Fargo's Marge Gunderson, and it's no surprise: in the twisted Coeniverse, they're as normal as they come.\n\nOverall, pretty much a modern classic, like most of the Coens' films, and, despite its dark streak, a bit of a feel-good movie, thanks to its oddly sweet and charming protagonist. As The Stranger points out: \"It's good knowing he's out there, The Dude.\""

The script is possibly the best coen script to date. I know there was a backlash when this was first released with people looking for Fargo 2 but in my opinion this is the better film. Ten out of ten in my opinion, but for those who are offended by a few hundred curse words I suggest you steer clear of this one and rent...i don't know...goldmember or something.

Some of the humor doesn't \"jump out\"at you like in other comedy movies, instead you more or less have to think about what is going on in the film to see the humor in it. The Big Lebowski is a classic, one of the Coen Bros. best, but only recently have I noticed more people watching the movie and enjoying it. I think as more people see the movie that they may have missed the Big Lebowski will gain more respect. For those of you that saw it on Comedy Central, your missing out on a lot of \"R\" rated comedy. Rent the DVD sometime and you'll know what I'm talking about here."

The film didn't really seem interesting after the first viewing, but when I saw it the second, third time (repeats on cable TV), I realized I was expecting some kind of a plot. But there's hardly any in the film. Instead, the film is full of brilliant dialogs, comic situations, \"the female form\" and sree lingonberri pancakes. Actually, if I was to quote my favorite lines from the film, it would probably take half a page.\n\nAnd the film doesn't fail to entertain after the first viewing, because there are so many hidden comic situations that one must really see the film a few times to notice. If you This is not the usual type of comedy, though. Can't tell more, or I might spoil your fun.\n\nBrilliant, really brilliant, and in my opinion very unusual as for an American film.

I doubt I've ever heard a better movie soundtrack.\n\nAnd don't you just love Sam Elliot as \"The Stranger\" - who blows mysteriously into L.A., like the tumbleweed in the opening scene.\n\nAs for Philip Seymour Hoffman's role.......too much!\n\nAnd lastly, the \"Busby Berkely\" dance sequence....pure psychedelia!"

In fact the explanation for things is a bit of a copout. Furthermore, at other times the Coen brothers are just lazy - ignoring their fantastic talent with words they rely too often on boring and inane swearing. Swearing can of course be funny, here though it isn't. It's repetitive and dull. So this is an average film IMHO, a wasted opportunity, though it does have interesting bits. Julianne Moore even gives a dull performance. And you can always rely on her. Try other Coen brothers films - Blood Simple, their first, is possibly their best."

Steve Buscemi is the same too, having an almost silent role here. The only more special ones are Julianne Moore and John Turturro.

Buscemi is spot on as always, and the plot is amazing.\n\nThe problems with this movie lie not in the work itself; but in its audience.

The humor comes from the absurd situations and especially the quirky dialogues, but, as with most black comedies, it's more of a chuckling quietly to yourself rather than laughing out loud experience. As a whole, the film felt a bit too episodical if not even pointless at times: the Coen Brother pointed out that the plot is not the focus, but they could have done at least a little better in that sense. Once the case gets abruptly resolved, there is really nothing that ties all the scenes together, however memorable each individual moment might have been. It's an inimitably stylish, fun, and imaginative film worth its cult status, but no matter how many times I watch it, it's not as hilarious and groundbreaking as all \"dudeists\" keep saying."

And it all started with a rug that tied the room together...\n\nJeff Bridges as The Dude here was simply an astonishing surprise to say the least. Never would I have pictured him or even felt he was capable enough to pull off this quirky character. Hats off Dude, and sorry for underestimating you. John Goodman's performance as Walter was another pleasant surprise as the hardcore Vietnam vet who cannot forget his buddies that died face down in the muck. There's a certain chemistry between the two that would have been all but impossible to foresee before getting started. The casting crew must've known something I didn't because it really makes the film.\n\nWhat more can be said of the Coen brothers? They simply know how to keep it simple yet extremely entertaining and wholly original. It is a rather short film but never lets up when it comes to the laughs and the characters. Definitely one of my favorite comedies of all time and I know I'm not alone. The dream sequences alone are worth the rental.\n\nIf white trash, Vietnam vets, nihilists, bowling, and smoking jays sounds appealing to you...then this would be a wonderful addition to your film collection.

It's a little bit discomforting how this \"comedy\" unintentionally reminds us that we are still fighting in Iraq after over a decade. Not to espouse my political views or suggest that this is a political film, but this film does focus our attention (via the Walter character) on our collective obsession with violence and encourages us to reevaluate our situation from the Dude's perspective: our communication lines are breaking down, \"new information has come to light,\" and like many of the characters in the film, we should be asking, \"WTF are we talking about?!\" When \"this aggression will not stand,\" the Dude doesn't raise a fist, \"the Dude abides\" and \"takes it easy.\" The Dude is a \"bigger\" man; he IS the Big Lebowski."

I found myself getting very upset and hating Bridges' and Goodman's characters. If this was the directors' motivation, then they succeeded big time. I think that the actors - Buscemi, Turturro, and Hoffman - all got lulled into a false sense by the success of the directors previous film - Fargo. What a shame and bad move. The film totally misses its point of being this off-beat quirky comedy. I can't say it enough, it was painful watching Goodman's character say the same stupid line to Buscemi \u2013 over and over. A complete waste of time."

But that wasn't still it.Finally I watched The Big Lebowski for the third time last year and I was really amazed.Maybe I could say \"third time's a charm\", I don't know, maybe I was to young in 1998 to understand and enjoy the brilliance of The Big Lebowski or maybe it's that kind of movie which keeps getting better and better each time you watch it. It is one of my favorite movies, there's something magical about it.You can watch each single scene over and over again and not get bored. The dialogues are hilarious,but I am aware of the fact, that not everybody would like that kind of humor, but I just love it! Magnifficent performance from all actors, especially Bridges, Goodman, and Buscemi.But supporting Seymour Hoffman, Stormare or Moore are outstanding too. I' ve read that when Cohens wrote the script they had all these actors in their mind and You can see it on the screen! Simple \"A must see\"!But of course, you know, that's just like my opinion man...Anyway the Dude abides!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Before I met \"The Dude\" and the rest of the cast I wasn't sure if the Coen Brother's could ever top their Citizen Kane(Fargo). After watching \"The Big Lebosky\" I found out just how talented these writer/director's were. The Big Lebosky is a genre trend setting masterpiece. With dialogue so close to perfection I would not change a single sentence. This is a movie of pure clever genius and has tremendous replay and stay power. Mark my words when I say: You can watch it a million times, and you will never get sick of it.\n\nThe story begins with the raspy southern drawl of \"The Stranger\"(Sam Elliot) preparing us with narration as the ever schlepped \"Dude\" (Jeff Bridges, Jeff Lebosky) is\n\nreturning home from buying some milk at the grocery store.\n\nUpon arriving home he is greeted by a couple of Jackie Treehorn's (notorious pornography producer) looking for \"Jeff Lebosky\" After realizing that the\n\n\"Dude\" was not in fact the right \"Jeff Lebosky\" (and one pee'd on rug and thus plot set up later)\n\nThe Henchmen exit. Thus we are brought along on one of the funniest and darkest tales of redemption, slacking, anger, mistaken identity, and league bowling! I can honestly say the best ride of my life was on the not so righteous\n\nand lethargic tale of \"The Dude\" While he tries to seek reparation for the \"soiled upon rug\" in his living room, and finds himself in the midst of doing so, getting involved with so many different forms of deception, unwanted responsibility and paranoia as The Dude agrees to act as courier when the other millionaire \"Jeffery Lebosky's\"(David Huddleston) kidnapped trophy wife \"Bunny\"(Tara reed) allegedly gets kidnapped.\n\nNeedless to say The Dude is in well over his head and Murphy's Law soon becomes reality to the motley crue of characters .\n\nThis movie is so cleverly written you wonder just how the plot gets pulled off with such grace. And the answer to that question lays in the A. The dialogue B. The character development And C. The amazing acting from the entire cast\n\nAs also starring \"Walter Sobcheck\"(John Goodman) \"Theodore(Donny) Karabatsos\"(Steve Buscemi)\"Maude Lebosky\"(Julianne Moore)Guest starring \"Jesus Quintana\"(John Turtorro) \"Brandt\"(Phillip Seymour Hoffman)ETC.\n\nAnd all these actors, no matter how small the part all make a juxtaposing impact On the all around greatness factor of this films hilarity and tightness\n\nBut make sure you relax your face muscles the night before watching this movie\n\nbecause the best of the best in my personal opinion comes from \"The Dude and Walter\"(Bridges and Goodman) as \"The Dudes\" Pacifism mentality counteracts with the Ever un predictable and over steam headed Vietnam veteran \"Walter Sobcheck\"(Goodman)\n\nwho will take any chance he can get to turn a conversation into reminiscing about his life in the war. With that being said Also turning in an unforgettable performance is \"Julianne Moore\" as \"Maude Lebosky\" the daughter of millionaire business man \"Jeffrey Lebosky\"(Dave Huddleston)\n\nThe on screen chemistry between these cast members is extremely memorable and sometimes confrontational, but always entertaining and clever. When you view it for yourself, You'll find yourself quoting and watching in awe,as these actors quickly become your bowling buddies and transform the silver screen into pure gold. this masterpiece of satirical cinema will intrigue your intellect and challenge your sense of humor and boundaries as The Big Lebosky will invade your personal space by remaining in your mind and everyday references of the films idiosyncrasies will become adjacent to your vocabulary. Pare all that with the groundbreaking camera work and all star soundtrack and you have a film that comes as close to perfection as you will ever find.\n\nAll in all and pound for pound \"The Big Lebosky\" is a 10! A true Timeless piece of film. The Coens Sistine Chapel if you will.\n\nSo \"Ever thus to the deadbeats\" that choose not to enjoy!!\n\nBut hey \" that's just like... My opinion man!\"\n\nBy Anthony S. Timo"

        "review_title": "Making Vit Der Funny Schtuff",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Big Lebowski\" is proof a screenplay doesn't need a story to make it today. Just create a couple of oddballs who have gloriously fractured conversations about any sort of bizarre thing, throw in a bunch of random stuff and an eccentric supporting cast, and don't worry if the plot doesn't actually go anywhere. Think \"Caddyshack\" with more cursing, a perfect film for regurgitating around a water cooler rather than watching on screen.\n\nJeff Bridges is the Dude, Jeff Lebowski, who because of some confusion with another Jeff Lebowski whose wife owes money to a sleazy porn merchant, finds himself the target of two toughs who \"soil\" his rug. Trouble accumulates as he seeks restitution and is recruited to help rescue the other Lebowski's kidnapped wife. Complications ensue when the other Lebowski's daughter seeks him out for a sperm donation, a gang of nihilists threaten his johnson, a detective trails after him in a blue Beetle, and stuff keeps happening to his car. The worst part is the constant interference from his bowling buddy, Walter (John Goodman), who sees parallels with Vietnam for everything, blows the ransom delivery, and butts heads with a rival bowler with a sex-offender past.\n\nI don't know, that doesn't read funny. But the movie is funny, especially when Walter and the Dude bicker. Getting this across from writing dialogue excerpts is not possible, not because of the profanity so much as the delivery, which is how it comes together. If comedic acting got the respect it deserves, Goodman would have been nominated for an Oscar; his Walter is a brilliant contrast of sudden rage and anal nitpicking (\"The chinaman is not the issue here, dude. I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, dude. Across this line, you DO NOT... Also, dude, chinaman is not the preferred nomenclature. Asian-American, please.\") Even Goodman's presence, wearing pus-colored sunglasses and a perpetual scowl under a buzzcut, is a marvel.\n\nBut Goodman's brilliance is in how well he walks the fine line set by the Coen Brothers in a typically challenging film for actors. Bridges is very good, too, but Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, John Turturro and other good actors are so mannered they become annoying.\n\nAlso, the story lines just kind of meander with no direction, like the Coens are ridiculing you for attempting to care about how any of it turns out. Did the Dude ever get a new rug? Did he and Walter win the match against Jesus the child molester? What the heck was the point of the cowboy narrator? If you care enough to ask such questions, it's like you are just the butt of the Coens' joke? Who's the %$&@ing nihilists here?\n\nThe film's weaknesses are evident even in the moments that shine, like a trio of musical comedy numbers done to music by Bob Dylan and Kenny Rogers. They are witty, vibrant set pieces that come in out of nowhere and charge quickly into various cartoony bits, but then meander and drizzle away, lamely explained as acid flashbacks the Dude keeps having when he is knocked out. They don't add anything to the story, but in that sense, at least they are consistent with the rest of what's presented.\n\nThe Coen Brothers remind me of the '70s jazz popsters Steely Dan, two arch standoffish types who are expert entertainers and creative geniuses but somewhat handicapped by their acerbic pose. They don't like being mistaken for someone who cares. The Coens have made some terrific films, like \"Raising Arizona\" and \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" and some overrated ones like \"Fargo\" and this. It's a film designed to make people laugh, and that's nice of them, but when one of the big jokes in the film involves casually killing off one of the good guys, you have to wonder whether the joke is really on you."

This and Fargo are my favorite Coen brother movies because of the environment around them affects the story. Now I know you can say the same thing about other Coen brother film or any film for that matter, but for me the snowy wasteland of Fargo, North Dakota and the suburban by day neon by night oasis of Los Angeles really make the films what they are (and in my perspective masterpieces!). Jeff Bridges famously plays his role to near perfection and in my opinion makes all of his other roles obsolete. This means whenever I see him in another movie as a different Character I only see him as the iconic role that he nailed in 1988. The Big Lebowski is my favorite movie and I recommend to anyone and everyone"

The script offers so many quotable words and lines and The Dude (played by Bridges) is the perfect character for this sort of script to thrive off.\n\nThe supporting cast also with Julianne Moore, Phillip Seymour Hoffman (God rest his soul) and Steve Buschemi all offered their class here. This is a film that has only gotten better with time and I loved all aspects of it.\n\nWe should all channel our inner Dude and go bowling a little more. And don't forget a White Russian\n\nA cracking film that I can only recommend others go enjoy too\n\nQuote - 'It really tied the room together' - The Dude\n\nRating - 5/5."

I am down with Fargo, which seems to be the other popular fan favorite for the Coens, but it is still 4th best at best. Big Lebowski is clear cut #1 Hudsucker Proxy is arguable #2 3rd could be: Raising Arizona, Blood Simple, or Miller's Crossing 4th: Fargo comes in ahead of O' Brother and Intolerbale Cruelty...barely.

        "review_detailed_main": "I'll try not to repeat what has been said in other reviews, but this is a special movie for me. I had gone through a very painful breakup and I was utterly miserable for two months. One night, I rented this movie (seeing it for the second time), I laughed my fool head off, and things got better again. Perhaps The Dude's final line in the movie (which I won't give away) provided me with hope and perspective. This is one of those rare comedies that just keeps getting funnier every time you see it. Jeff Bridges, who is so good at intense, brooding roles, has unbelievable comic timing here. Some criticize the plot as overly meandering, and it is. But the film's aura is compelling, and you just want to go along for the ride.\n\nLike some other Coen Brothers films, The Big Lebowski takes the archetypes of a particular genre and spins them in an utterly unique way. All of the staples of the film noir detective story are here: the LA setting, the kidnapping, the aristocratic client, the easily enraged sidekick, the femme fatale, the miscreants and lowlifes who impede the progress of the case, etc. However, the lead is not someone with an unwavering sense of purpose as is usual, but the role is instead filled by The Dude, quite possibly the laziest person in the world. As the expression goes, hilarity ensues. Since this is the Coen Bros., the humor is obviously not like most modern comedies in which vapid characters say and do stupid things in predictable ways. The Big Lebowski keeps you off balance with loads of witty dialogue, plot twists, and gags that absolutely blindside you. Seeing The Big Lebowski will make your life better. Unless of course, you end up not liking the movie."

Actually, it is a very finely crafted movie even if it looks as if they were running out of film and just tied everything up in the last reel. I am so glad it came out on DVD as it gives you the opportunity to pick up other bits and pieces that seem almost secondary (well, actually they are but who cares). Like in the opening scene where the Dude's head is shoved down the toilet after he bashed his bowling ball against the door jam. If you notice the dent left is still there all through the film. It's a small thing but one that make the whole movie a gem. Jeff Bridges IS the Dude (and a biliiant piece of acting to explain to the Big Labowski that she (Bunny) kidnaped herself). Both Goodman and Stevie are perfectly cast and Johnny T. is just perfect as the Jesus. Like Stone's \"Any Given Sunday\", this movie bases itself in a sport for which I have no interest but, boy, what a movie. I have to give this 9 out of 10 as it is only the Coen's second best movie. The first is, of course, Millers Crossing."

And the Dude is saying how he lost money today and how he was in a bad mood earlier. It's still in the beginning of the movie. I think it's right after he was with Maude Lebowski, and after getting out of this limo he gets forced into another limo finding the old lebowski and brent. If anyone knows what song is playing that would be cool, because it's been bugging the blazes out of me."

        "review_detailed_main": "No matter how many times I see this movie, it never gets old. At this point, I've easily seen it more than half a dozen times and I STILL find myself laughing throughout. This movie was my first exposure to the Coen brothers and it hooked me. Set in 1990's Los Angeles, the film follows the Dude, an unemployed stoner with a passion for bowling, as a case of mistaken identity and a soiled rug lead to his involvement in recovering a kid-napped woman. Honestly, that little synopsis doesn't do the film justice and it'd really be best to just watch it.\n\nThe characters are what make this film so memorable. Jeff Bridges as the Dude, what can I say. Since seeing him in this movie, I haven't been able to picture him as anyone else (made it interesting seeing him as the villain in Jon Favreau's \"Iron Man\", heh). He totally embodies this character, with his chilled demeanor and stoned investigating. Stealing the scene almost as often as the lead is John Goodman as the Dude's buddy, Walter. A Vietnam veteran who can't help but regress to 'Nam rants every time something grates on his nerves, Walter's attempts to help Dude in his predicament only make matters worse. These two characters alone (with, of course, credit to the fantastic writing of the Coens) fill the movie with infinitely quotable dialogue.\n\nSupporting Bridges and Goodman are a myriad of great talent. Steve Buscemi, Julianne Moore, Peter Stormare, Sam Elliott, and Philip Seymour Hoffman contribute to film though the one of the best supporting characters has to be John Turturro's Jesus Quintana. Despite only being in two scenes, his role as the pedophile bowler made for one of the best moments. My absolute favorite sequences in the movie have to be the Dude's hallucinations/dream sequences, particularly the GUTTERBALLS number. A great soundtrack, wicked casting, sharp writing, and constant laughs give this movie infinite replay value and it'll never get old."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's not much that can be said about \"The Big Lebowski\" that hasn't already been said. Not only is it a hilarious tale of mistaken identity and personal greed, but it is a landmark film in terms of style, character, and philosophy. It is on a very short list of truly essential films from the 1990's, and stands up to as many viewings as you choose to throw at it.\n\nOne particular shining star is the main character, Jeffery \"The Dude\" Lebowski, played by Jeff Bridges. A perfect embodiment of the slacker lifestyle combined with the Zen mentality, The Dude carries the picture as the unfortunate victim of external events (\"All The Dude ever wanted was his rug back\"). Full of hilarious lines and deadpan reactions, Bridges ensures that no scene is without insight and comedy (even Donny's \"funeral\").\n\nJohn Goodman is also a high point, turning in what is probably the best performance of his career as Walter Sobchak. A Vietnam vet holding a grudge against the rest of the world, Walter lends his unique form of support to The Dude. The scene with Walter substituting a \"ringer\" for the ransom money is one of the greatest few minutes of film I have ever seen. Goodman really dives into the character, delivering the little idiosyncrasies that lend unquestioned authenticity to the character.\n\nThere are plenty of other notable performances, including Steve Buschemi as the slow-witted Donny and Philip Seymour Hoffman as the tight-assed Brandt. The Cohen brothers spun a true masterpiece with this movie, one that seems only to become better as the years pass. A must-watch for any film fan."

Everything he does you do with him, you feel with him, you think with him. You can see that he is not a simple character, yet you can grasp him entirely. And the most important about his character is that he is believable, real. This put together make you feel you can be him, can feel light as he does. That is what this movie is about, is about you going inside it and taste the ideas. Is about you freeing your mind and absorbing the entire set. And this is also why you shouldn't watch if you just want to laugh.\n\nI really don't have much else to tell you, I would easily spoil it all. This is about the experience not about the opinions and i write reviews for you to decide if you would watch, not to talk about it after the movie. So buckle your belt and ride this train."

I personally loved this movie when I first saw it but probably would have only a given it an 8. The more you watch it however, the more your knowledge of the characters from the fist viewing build very quirky and nuanced personalities that make the characters very real and yet surreal. This makes it that much better, when you hear some of the comments because you know where they came from, just as if you heard of something that a friend did and depending on who that friend was, it makes their actions that much funnier.\n\nThere are flaws in every movie, but what matters is do they bother you or not, and I don't remember any that do, and I have seen the film at least ten times. Each time just as good as the last, and this is what makes this movie so special is repeatability. You can watch it and start it over right afterwords and laugh just as hard.\n\nJohn Goodman should have at least been nominated for a best supporting actor as he is excellent in this movie as Walter. Also, John Turturro is excellent as \"the Jesus\" in a limited role. Other actors turn in very good performances as well. I think you need the right sense of humor for this movie to work for you, but everyone that I do know that likes it, loves it and that makes it worth viewing, because if it does work for you, you will understand where the genius is located in this film and you will love it as well.\n\nI won't mention any details about the film, because thats what the film is for and frankly if I tried to summarize it it just wouldn't do the movie justice.\n\nSee it sometime when you're bored, and hopefully you will see what I see in what I still say is the best comedy of the 90's"

There are quite a few chuckle worthy moments and the characters are quite funny in how quirky they are.The actors are rather charming and the Coen brothers are good directors. However, that doesn't make up for the fact that this movie adds up to nothing. Random events happen for no good reason, many of the characters are completely pointless and even the story is unnecessary as well. It starts off with this unique crime plot about \"The Dude\"-a lazy bum-who gets mistaken for a millionaire with the same name as him. The Dude then gets caught up in this convulted scheme by German nihilists to blackmail the millionaire by holding his trophy wife hostage. But by the end of the flick I realized that absolutely nothing was at stake. I don't want to spoil it so I will just leave it at that. I don't mind if a story just wants to meander around aimlessly. Alice in Wonderland does that but at least there's a reason for it, they are in a dream like world that makes no sense. Here, they set up this world like its flesh and blood reality where things are run by rules and regulations but then some things will happen out of nowhere and lead to nothing-like the plot. You can't have a world run by both chaos and order. It just doesn't make any sense. That's The Big Lebowski. It feels like the whole movie is a big joke the Coen brothers are pulling on the audience. You are given a tour of strange characters that are tied together by a overly complicated plot that meant nothing in the end. I wouldn't recommend this unless watching a bunch of walking character quirks stumble around for an hour and a half sounds like fun to you. And if you do, don't worry you aren't alone."

The characters he encounters within the story manipulate him, all for their own selfish ends and many moralise at him whilst they are pursuing their own nefarious schemes.\n\nThe Dude abides this treatment, either through inability to challenge it, verbally or physically or in some cases through lack of understanding he is being manipulated. But as he endures the films indignities, he never wavers and in the end returns to his normal pattern of living.\n\nWhereas the go getters, the schemers, the users, the pro-active people have all been undone by the own machinations, hoisted by their own petards. The Dude is vindicated in his lifestyle, by default.\n\nWe are all asked to participate to some degree in our everyday lives in the plotting or social mores of others we feel we have to answer to, the Dude reminds us to step back from time to time and let the cards fall where they may.\n\nControl, through opting out, thats why we love the Dude and thats why the Dude, is the Dude !"

As the movie ended, I knew I didn't waste my time!\n\nJoel and Ethan Coen are great creators in the world of film-making. I've watched 'No Country for Old Men' and what I took away from that film was 'silence is golden.' But this film is an entirely different animal. 'The Big Lebowski' reminds me of 'Dazed and Confused' and 'Reservoir Dogs' in the way that it's so easy to relate to the characters that the Coen brothers superbly created. The writing is the strongest aspect of this picture. They speak in such a 'down to earth' tone that it seems like you're listening to one of your best friends speaking to you and it really helps the flow of the story. It's easy to read the characters and the atmosphere is shoved in your face, but not necessarily forced. It's brilliant. I salute the writers!\n\nThe acting in this picture can be summarized with one certain name\u0085'John Goodman.' He stole the show. Period. End of story. Whenever his character was on screen, my eyes and ears were glued to him and when his character wasn't on screen, I was passionately awaiting an entrance. John Goodman's character has patience when everybody else's blood is rushing and he believes he knows the whole story without even knowing a shred of truth. He never looks back and never thinks twice. He was a joy to watch and I would watch the film again just because of him. Moving on, I had my doubts about Jeff Bridges at the beginning of the film. I didn't think he could pull off the character I was brought in front of in the beginning but as the film went on, he grew on me. I was buying everything he was saying. Great words with such a modern tone made his character just as enjoyable as Goodman's.\n\nThe music in this picture met with the story at such a point, I was hypnotized. It had a 'Farelly Brothers' edge to it. At times, I thought I was watching one of their films. The music had such a 'good mood' atmosphere and it leaves you so relaxed. It's the kind of music you would have playing if you were going on a long road trip with a few buddies.\n\n'The Great Lebowski' was fun. I can't say that about a lot of films I've seen in my life. It's a film that's worth a second viewing and if you haven't seen this film, I strongly recommend you give it a look."

John Goodman, however, was slightly annoying, and not nearly as effective as he was in \"Barton Fink\". John Turturo was also great in a small role as Jesus the bowler. See this film..."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Big Lewboski is among the best comedy films of all time, kind of. It has a very disjointed storyline, and is, at times, hard to follow (or comprehend). However, the writer allows enough latitude for the actors to make it work. The casting of Jeff Bridges as 'Dude' is central to the movie. I can't think of another actor that could have pulled this off as well as he did. It really tied the movie together.\n\nThe Dude seems not to want anything but to be left alone. The uncertainty presented to him as the result of a case of mistaken identity (maybe) shatters the warm comfort that 'Dude' has spent his life creating and maintaining. It makes him very uncomfortable, and causes him to react accordingly. Walter is the Dude's salvation. He forces the 'Dude' to pursue the source of his discomfort. The more that Walter exerts himself, the better it gets. John Goodman's heroic, manic performance gave the movie the only sense of stability in an otherwise chaotic circumstance presented to the 'Dude'. Both Walter and 'Dude' are pretty intelligent, introspective and spiritual beings in their own rights. They just don't know it.\n\nI have no idea what Donny was doing in the movie, other than to have Steve Buschemi die in yet another Cohen brothers film. The dialog is wild. The Big Lewboski yelling 'The Plane has crashed into the mountain', Maudes discussion of the effect of vaginae on men, and all of The Jesus' scenes, down to his purple jump suit (The Purple Jesus) are bizarre. Everything coming out of the 'Dude's' mouth is very funny. Like 'A Night at the Opera' and 'The Producers' good comic actors, presented with the right opportunity, can take it over the falls. The more you watch this movie, the better it gets."

        "review_detailed_main": "Overtly based on Raymond Chandler's classic novel \"The Big Sleep\", The Big Lebowski is my favourite work from the Coen Brothers, along with Miller's Crossing. When released in 1998 cinema-goers were baffled by the film, with most viewers not being able to even gather an opinion. However, once the film was available for purchase a cult following began to emerge, which has given birth to the annual Lebowski Fest and a so-called religion named \"Dudeism.\" The world of Lebowski has become an element of modern pop-culture, while Jeff Bridge's character \"The Dude\" has developed into an icon of apathy. His days are spent bowling, drinking, experiencing occasional acid flashbacks and delving in pacifism.\n\nConducting an exhaustingly (and intentionally) complex tale of a trophy wife's kidnapping, The Big Lebowski puts fourth a crime story as a means of making everything about the picture even more ludicrous than its characters. You see, the Coen Brothers routinely craft films concerning characters that have become swathed in absurdist situations. This is an ulterior motive; a means of clashing wacky diversities with an impelling sense of convolution. The Big Lebowski is about characters that are blissfully unaware of the complications which arouse due to their erratic behaviour. Jeff Bridge's protagonist The Dude (a.k.a. Jeffrey Lebowski) becomes apart of a kidnapping plot by accident. He unwittingly stumbles across the scheme after a contextual naming error, in which two house-breaking thugs urinate on his rug. In response The Dude seeks compensation from the intended victim who happens to carry the same name, hence the confusion. As you can see, I am rambling and could do with a \"Caucasian\" cocktail.\n\nThe Big Lebowski has been apart of my life for many years now; I recall lapping up the dialogue to such an extent that I would unintentionally quote the film during everyday conversations and I still do. This boils down to a screenplay which will retain its status as one of the finest ever written. By no means is the script artificial or plagiarised, instead the breathtaking originality of it came as a breath of fresh air to the QT-laden dialogue which circulated throughout the independent cinema of the '90s. Exemplifying imagination and entertainment is the aim of The Big Lebowski; dumb, half-witted nonsense is not what the film illustrates, as some people have wrongly accused it of being. Oh, and I must not disregard a clear and present fact; Jeff Bridges offers one of the greatest performances of all-time.\n\nDo not dismiss this masterpiece as a senseless twaddle, as that would be an unfair accusation for such a multi-layered outing in confrontational, elaborate humour. This is comedy as an art form, and so is conducted on an ambitious scale of subtly intelligent, foul-mouthed wit. Except this is a farce crafted on a mesmerising scale of ingenuity and radiating charm. Characters like Walter Sobchak, Donny Kerabatsos, Jesus Quintana and of course the German nihilists are irrefutable creations of hypocritical hilarity. Throughout the picture The Dude encounters a vast array of sarcastically written characters, which are effectively caricatures of combined personalities. Stylistically, the film is crammed to the brim with stunning film-making procedures (e.g. the Jackie Treehorn section) which accentuate the confrontational wackiness of what could be hailed as a \"warped homage to film-noir.\" For a film of the '90s, the soundtrack is punctuated with retro rock & roll from forgotten eras and in essence identifies a \"hippy\" stance.\n\nIt might be worth noting that this review is just my opinion, man. Even so, that should not stop you from viewing a film which is destined to be regarded as something not just of the '90s, but of today's culture, too. Remember: abide by The Dude's -rational, whether you like it or not- philosophies. Simply take each day as it comes and try not to live in the past, stranger."

He is roughed up, money is demanded of him that he does not have, his head is unceremoniously swirled in the toilet and the toughs threaten to return, but they have the wrong Lebowski! This simple case of mistaken identity leads to a comedy of errors involving a kidnapping, a million-dollar ransom, Jesus in a purple bowling suit, a duffel bag full of dirty undies, an attack ferret and even a spicy bowling themed dream sequence. The Dude is inept, lazy and hopeless, but there is a time and place for everyone. He is in way over his head, yet so is everyone else. 20 years after its release and the film still one of my all-time favorites. It was my first Coen brothers film. Their brilliance and originality is instantly recognizable. The story and characters are full of delightful depth and details, the writing is witty and consistently dazzling, there is never a dull moment, and on top of everything it is really, really funny. At times I could hardly breath I was laughing so hard. Among such moments is the confrontation with the ferret, the parking lot skirmish heart attack and the bowling rants and taunts of Jesus. Finding balance is one thing the Coen brothers excel at. Each character has offsetting strengths and weaknesses, every setting is shown in wondrous light as well as the shadows, and nothing is beyond reproach. No one and nothing is put on a pedestal, or trashed without a fair fight. The casting of Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, Philip Seymour Hoffman and John Turturro is brilliant. The Coens have such amazing insight into the American character; rich and poor, country and city, women and men, and cultured or not. They cut across boundaries, religions, philosophies, regions and political persuasions, and they do it seamlessly and randomly as a tumbling tumbleweed and as unlikely as a bowling alley prophet!"

        "review_detailed_main": "At a Conservative Party ccktail function sometime last year, after a few drinks the subject naturally got onto best films. The general concensus was that \"Withnail & I\" had that title of funniest, and of that there was little genuine argument. However, there was a small contingent of persons present who claimed that the Coen brothers with Lebowski, a then, recent offering, could possibly wrest the title from Robinson's hitherto safe hands. Though I should add that they voiced this opinion in a humble and respectful manner.\n\nAn investigation ensued, and within a week I had located an establishment that was to play it, and set to my task, viz. a comparison with studious meticulousisity.\n\nTo take the film as it stands would be the only way to treat it fairly because, to be fair to it, it is completely different to Withnail. It is a totally different kind of humour, and style of filming. Whereas Withnail features a kind of low budget dark, earthy and realistic humour, Lebowski has a certain elaborate feel to it, from the expensive sets and abstract scenes to the wealth of locations and Hollywood feel. But enough of the comparisons, I'm supposed to be writing about Lebowski here, so no more Withnail. But let it be said, they are both titled on names and concentrate on bums (or a bum).\n\nLebowski tends to rely on seemingly obvious jokes and repeated lines and styles,(such as \"shut the F***K UP Donny\", \"I'll suck your c**k for a thousand dollars\" and \"Am I wrong?\") combined with a rewarding subtle blend of character-based humour, (such as Lebowski never finishing his lines, Donny never getting to say anything, Brandt's nervous mannerisms, and numerous self referential statements). Some people from the Dumb and Dumber school of comedy appreciation will \"get\" very little of Lebowski, and will not rate it. These are largely the same kind of people who thought that Mallrats was better than Clerks.\n\nThe introduction to the film and, most importantly, to Lebowski is utterly perfect. The look at this supposed bum, and then at the till girl to put things in perspective, creates good empathy with the inner workings of the protagonist. He took his choice, others take theirs. Great camera work and combination with Dylan provides the perfect setting to the bowling hall, and hence, the backdrop to the film. This style of filming is the Coen brothers at their very best, and blending of the title sequence into the story is done as well as anyone could do.\n\nThis film is made of a combination of straightforward camera shots and dialogue with very little action (aside from bowling or driving). This is then juxtaposed with some very abstract scenes such as dream sequences and slow motion footage of (questionably) real situations. This technique often creates a very effective result though sometimes can become tiresome. The main crux of the film is set in the real world and revolves around The Dude attempting to repatriate his living room with a rug. This is largely done in a very ordinary fashion but with a great wealth of humorous conversation. Goodman provides many memorable sayings. Where the film goes at a tangent to this, but with immediate purpose in mind, it works very well. The best examples of this are the introductory bowling scene (as stated), and the introduction of the loveable Jesus. When these scenes are not so welcome is when they actively distract from the flow of the story and serve only to break it up in an undesirable manner. Still, without this experimentation we would have been without some of the film's most impressive moments.\n\nAs The Dude's main opponent is The Big Lebowski, a disabled veteran with a personal achievement complex. He is acted out brilliantly by Huddleston, has an excellent vocabulary ( including micturate) and is a very aggressive character, especially towards The Dude. Looking after him is his faithful servant Brandt who has some delightful nervous mannerisms and peculiar gaits which work well with his characters speaking parts.\n\nThe blend of humour is mostly based around slight subtlety on the part of some characters, and outright over-the-top acting on the part of others. Add this to some great visuals, though not over the top, and the result is a finely crafted humorous product. In all, though not as good as the all conquering Withnail, Lebowski does manage to better Fargo, and is certainly one of the funniest films in recent years."

He's incredibly funny!\n\nSteve Buscemi is, as always, excellent, I have so much respect for this man. In every movie he's been in, he's always been able to raise it to an extra level. He's brilliant.\n\nPhilip Seymour Hoffmann is just outstanding, one of the best actors out there. The roles he has chosen says it all.\n\nNot to forget John Turturro as Jesus. Now that's magic! His moments in the movie are really HIS. He is so funny! In in contrast to The Dude it is hilarious!\n\nAND the Germans!!! I love the Germans, and I love that Flea from Red Hot Chili Peppers is one of them.\n\nI could go on and on, but these and the rest of the cast are all part of an absolutely unique movie.\n\nIt's timeless comedy."

The Dude's first mistake is paying a visit to his wealthy namesake in the hopes of getting a replacement for his soiled carpet. But instead of a Persian loaner, our reluctant hero and his buddy Walter are swept up in a Coenesque comedy/thriller of extortion, double-cross, deception, embezzlement, sex and dope.

The Dude, as the narrator so eloquently puts it, is the man for his place and time. Although he defines laziness, and The Dude is lazy, he is a hero. But what is a hero? I'll stop stealing lines from the movie and just say that this is one of the best put together movies of all time. It is a cult classic and I can't imagine why it's not more mainstream, but it is clever, original, and I must say that John Goodman as Walter Sobchak is one of the best characters to ever grace the big screen. If you've seen this movie, I'm confident you'll agree. This is one of the few films that can be silly and real at the same time. To put it bluntly, this is a must see if you haven't seen it, and if you have, watch it again; it only gets better!"

The 'Dude' and Vietnam vet. Walter (John Goodman) who thinks he is Jewish, are the main characters and are great fun in the movie and of course the mostly ignored Donny (Steve Buscemi). the acting, writing, directing and somewhat bizarre cinematography are amazing, if you like creative drama- comedies watch this film, if you don't watch it anyway."

Absolutely not, and this is because of the wonderful dialogue the Coen Brothers have provided for us.\n\nThe acting is one of the strengths. Jeff Bridges is absolutely perfect as The Dude. John Goodman is hilarious as Walter. Steve Buscemi really doesnt do much except get insulted by John Goodman. Julianne Moore takes a different kind of role and does well.\n\nTo enjoy The Big Lebowski, you must do one thing: Forget the plot. You will hate the movie if you try to figure out the plot. It is a mess of a plot. At one point it gets incoherent, but that scene is one of the best in the film.\n\nThe Big Lebowski is not a masterpiece, in fact its even really far from a near-masterpiece stature.

        "review_title": "Sometimes there's a film\u0085 sometimes\u0085 there's a film.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Now it was sometime in the year 1997, after the powers that be at the Academy of Motion Pictures and Science had decided to give a whole lot of recognition and awards to a film called Fargo, that a couple of boys named Joel and Ethan (though the most common nomenclature simply called them the Coen brothers) were thinking of making their next film. Now Joel and Ethan knew they had done well with their last film, that aforementioned Fargo, and they thought that their next film should be big. A big film. A film so big that it might as well have the word big in the title. And they - and we're talking about the Coen brothers here \u2013 well they just so happened to come up with such a motion picture, a picture which managed to be big as well as managing to be well outside of any range of conventional expectations. And that very motion picture happened to be one now known as The Big Lebowski.\n\nOr something like that. In fact, the Coens have, true to form, resisted discussing the inspiration for or meaning of what can still be considered one of their wildest, strangest and most inspired works of cinematic genius in as adamant and heated terms as the debates speculating on the film's 'true meaning' or 'purpose'. But part of the genius of the film is that whether regarded as a caustic political allegory (it is worth paying attention to the brief snippets of early 1990s American political news shown and referred to regardless), a loving and witty send up of all the conventions of a pulp, Raymond Chandler style film noir detective story (with a knowingly incomprehensible, convoluted plot) or simply a remarkably strange comedy, the film works. For whatever reason, the precise cocktail (a cinematic White Russian perchance) of absurdly quotable dialogue, inspired and memorable character bits, bizarre dream sequences, slow motion musical interludes and occasional dashes of self-reflexive profundity, all fused together by the impeccable technical double act of Roger Deakins' sumptuous cinematography and Carter Burwell's obtrusively resonant music makes for a work of strange, clunky madness and perfection which never quite manages to do what is expected of it or hit a wrong note, no matter what inferences or expectations the viewer brings to the table.\n\nBut the film's true genius lies in the fact that, despite its guided bizarreness baiting analysis, the most gleefully likely 'point' is that the film, like the ongoing in-joke of its nihilist antagonists, is ultimately not about 'anything'. The entire enterprise can be seen as an extensive exercise in 'talking a lot but ultimately saying nothing', much like Sam Elliott's mysterious Stranger's priceless rambling of a narration. One almost dares to believe that the Coens' true joke is all of the speculation, controversy, debates over the film and religions derived from it being ultimately unwarranted, as the film was crafted with no such motivations, or ultimately any motivations at all. And ultimately, perhaps the most poignant point that can be extracted from the film is that it doesn't need a point, as entertaining as it can be to try to impose meaning on the strange and hilarious string of events passed off as a narrative. The film functions beautifully simply as a chance to hang out with some lovable, hilarious and very memorable characters, to experience the thrill of a mystery haphazardly investigated (with the viewer continually left as befuddled as the characters), to listen to some great music and to ultimately learn, much like The Dude, to simply accept the absurdity of it all and simply exist and try to get through. And again, whether such an absence of point is truly the most satisfying explanation of the film remains a moot point \u2013 no matter what lens the film is examined through, it has never been so enjoyable to enter the gleefully odd, remarkably stylized world of the Coen brothers and simply exist.\n\nBut the film's true joy lies in its collection of eccentric characters and equally off-the-wall performances. Jeff Bridges has never been better, inhabiting the laid back, drugged up and haphazardly heroic role of The Dude with an uncanny ease and magnificent comedic timing \u2013 a perpetually watchable triumph of characterization. Consistent scene-stealer John Goodman is equally priceless as faux-Jewish, rage-filled Vietnam veteran Walter Sobchak, a bellowing, stubbornly illogical yet strangely lovable satire of the crass yet well intentioned Western stereotype. Julianne Moore similarly generates a performance which is outlandish, flat out hilarious and hits perhaps a little too close to home as an absurdist feminist visual artist. David Huddleston rants, raves, screeches and bellows to sublime comedic effect as the titular industrialist The Big Lebowski, and Steve Buscemi transforms clueless yet lovable into a work of art as the continually \"out of his element\" Donny. But sheer magic can be found just as much in the supporting cast, with Philip Seymour Hoffman as obsessively prissy personal assistant Brandt, John Turturro as grotesque, purple spandex-clad, gyrating, former pedophile bowler Jesus Quintana, Peter Stormare as a deadpan nihilist porn star and Tara Reid as the compulsively greedy and promiscuous Bunny Lebowski along with the innumerable supporting bit parts each demonstrating exquisitely inventive and staggeringly funny characterizations, all excelling during their respective moments to shine.\n\nWithout question the film will not prove fitting for all tastes, and complaints have been raised of its being self-indulgently alienating and strange, overlong and aimlessly rambling. Yet for those generally attuned to the Coens' incomparably oddball frequency, The Big Lebowski proves about as inventive, fresh, compelling and insanely comical (as well as potentially thematically provocative) as a film can get, and even the articulated complaints against it somehow manage to work more in its favour than detrimentally. One of the few films which visibly improves from an already high standard upon each viewing, The Big Lebowski remains a cinematic comedy masterpiece. And yes, the Dude abides.\n\n-10/10"

I'll also mention that I live by dry sarcasm and underlying suggestion.\n\nInterestingly enough, I hated this movie the first time I saw it. Missing the first 10 minutes certainly didn't help, as I had a hard time following. However, nothing really stood out that I enjoyed.\n\nAs I watched the movie ~25 more times over the next 10 years, I saw everything that I had missed in that first viewing. And it became entirely clear to me the pure genius and wit that goes into EVERY scene and EVERY line of dialog.\n\nThis movie has the best character definition I've ever seen. Even though you can't necessarily identify with the characters, you feel as if you've known them for years within the first couple minutes of meeting them. Sure, they are stereotypical, but they are also brilliantly acted and portrayed, making them so believable.\n\nGoodman gives the performance of a lifetime. Walter is so over-the-top ridiculous, and yet so surprisingly content as such, one can't help but to laugh at how seriously he takes himself.\n\nAnd then there's Jesus. Everyone else does a top-notch job, but he steals the show. Two scenes, both equally outrageous. Costumed, acted and written to perfection.\n\nIf you find yourself disliking this movie, watch it again (unless you're easily offended by the *F* word). Let every line of dialog sink in, along with the way it's delivered. When you find yourself laughing hard at your favorite parts, rewind them and listen to the reactions of characters that you may have missed because you were laughing so hard. They are equally as rewarding.\n\nThere is so much to digest in the Big Lebowski, it deserves to be viewed a couple times a year. You will undoubtedly see/hear something you probably missed the previous time."

You might think it is only about a stoner anti-hero hero, and it is to some extend, but it is also about ordinary people dealing with stuff they ain't prepared for - being a bigger person than you think you are - handling the messy stuff life throws at you without shutting down and becoming rigid. It is about finding your inner-dude... And maybe, just maybe, this particular movie is growing in popularity at this particular time because of the way things are - the pathetic and clueless leaders we have - the direction they are taking us... yuk! - our seeming inability to do anything about it - the endless frustrations of our menu driven impersonal telephone world - and maybe there is also some nostalgia for the 60's and 70's, when for a brief shining moment, there was a sense of real life happening, and a sense of optimism blooming - that is missing today - \"well, uh, that's just your opinion man...\""

Jeff Bridges is also great as \"The Dude.\" The only \"problem\" with the script is that it must be too intellectual for popular culture. I assume that's where the movie flew over the heads of many viewers."

Anytime a movie takes place in between the years of 1970-1994 its got my attention. Its also a comedy. I am a comedy freak. I love comedy, comedy is my life. This is real comedy, the funny stuff. One thing I love about this movie that I haven't heard anybody else say is that the movie had thee perfect music to it. Fantastic music throughout the whole film. My favorite characters were The Dude (Of course) Walter and Donny. I am a fan of all three of the actors who played those parts, Jeff Bridges, John Goodman and Steve Buscemi. Poor Donny was always being told to shut up by Walter. The Dude was mixed up in the other Jeffery Lebowski's problems and Walter threw his undies out the car window and wants them back from those Nazis. Those three pal's sport was bowling. I've actually enjoy it as well. Some other people I had noticed in the movie were Tara Reid as Bunny, Dom Irrera as the driver and Jack Kehler as Marty. I'm also fans of them. To wrap this whole thing up I want to say if you haven't seen this movie and you want to see a great comedy about a guy whos just trying to get by in life, watch The Big Lebowski starring Jeff Bridges."

Bridges will never be able to shake of this powerful performance, or kick of the nickname \"The Dude\".

Total attendance was myself (solo), a thirty or forty something married couple, two young guys, a dating couple and another group of two or three college students.\n\nA group dynamic soon established itself. We all became so sore from laughing that no one wanted to be the initial victim of the next gag. But each time someone would start laughing and we all helplessly joined in, EVERY TIME.\n\nWe really did think we could hold out once, but the next thing The Dude dropped the joint in his pants and his Torino ended up sideways in the alley. After that we gave up on even trying. It was the most powerful bonding experience I ever had with strangers in a theater.\n\nI have always been completely high on Jeff Bridges' talent, wondering why he was not appreciated like DeNiro, Duvall, Hackman, Pacino, etc. It seemed odd to me that he will probably be remembered for playing this part, but now I think that might not be a bad fate after all. I think he is like Robert Mitchum - the best Hollywood actor alive, under appreciated because he makes it look so easy. Lebowski is the perfect example of that. It looks like a simple acting job but no one could have done it better, or even as well.\n\nTo give the Coen Brothers their due, the one-two-three roll of Fargo-The Big Lebowski-Oh Brother, Where Art Thou may be unmatched in cinema history. And they keep getting better."

The Dude (Jeff Lebowski, played by Jeff Bridges) is your average unemployed stoner whose number one hobby is bowling. His friends and teammates are Walter Sobchak (John Goodman), a Vietnam veteran, and Donny (Steve Buscemi), who is never allowed to get more than a few words in.\n\nThe Dude becomes involved first with a vandalism at his apartment, then later tangled in a web of robbery, extortion, kidnapping and pornography.

        "review_detailed_main": "There's really only one good part of The Big Lebowski, but it's a REALLY good part. It's one of those scenes that you see in a movie and you tell your friends about it for years, you constantly spout off hilarious quotes from that scene that you remember laughing so hard about, you develop inside jokes about the scene with the friends who were lucky enough to be there to watch it with you, and you may even begin to regularly consume certain types of alcoholic beverages that you saw enjoyed by the main characters in that scene. The earth-quakingly memorable scene (indeed, as I said before, the only good scene in the entire film) is the one that begins immediately after the opening credits and ends approximately 117 minute later just before the screen fades and the end credits roll.\n\nNot laughing? To hell with you, that's funny! And the movie's even funnier! Every character in The Big Lebowski is developed perfectly to serve the purpose of the story. These characters truly have personality, especially The Dude ('Who the f**k IS this guy?!'), Walter ('Donny, you're out of your league!'), and even Mr. Lebowski's geeky assistant, Brandt. They may occasionally be stereotypical characters, but they fit perfectly with the story, augmenting it even though it's already complex and interesting. This movie has an excellent plot line that is punctuated with endlessly hilarious dialogue ('Donny, you're outta your element!'), and peppered with well-developed and interesting characters. Jeff Bridges delivers a spectacular performance as the Dude, flawlessly capturing the slacker attitude and lazy lifestyle that that character lives. His love for White Russians has made that drink a staple at my house, and is now among my favorite alcoholic drinks.\n\nYeah, big accomplishment, but that's the kind of thing that makes a movie like this even better. As a college student, I can see the difference between the slacker life that I lived in high school, and the extremely busy one that I live now. The Dude has chosen to perpetuate that lifestyle, living his life on the couch and at the bowling alley, constantly dirt-poor but obviously perfectly content with himself. The only time he is even the slightest bit upset is when something disrupts that lifestyle and his rug gets ruined. Clearly, a nice rug is not something that a person in The Dude's line of work (i.e. unemployment) can easily replace. He is even almost completely calm when the guys break into his apartment at the beginning of the movie, and doesn't really seem to be too upset until one of them p****s on his rug.\n\nThe interactions between The Dude, Walter (John Goodman), Donny (Steve Buscemi), and, eventually, the Jesus combine to make some of the most amusing moments of the film, but it is enormously entertaining from beginning to end. There cannot possibly be enough praise given to this movie to do it justice. Watch this movie, you are sure to love it. And if you don't, watch it again, because you must have missed something. A true contemporary classic of modern comedy."

The movie was so gratuitously laced with obscenities throughout that it seemed to serve no purpose and lost its shock value after the first couple of minutes. The only redeeming value of this movie are some of the interesting camera shots like the bowling ball cam and some of the hallucinatory dream sequences (and the soundtrack). The Coen brothers have been asked if they came up with this storyline while under the influence. Perhaps but I think you would have to be under the influence to find any enjoyment out of this waste of time."

I find \"The Big Lebowski\" to be, not simply a very funny movie (one of the funniest I've seen), but also a damn good movie in terms of character, story, plot, and themes. So few people are interested in making good comedies anymore. \"The Big Lebowski\" is like a gift from heaven.\n\nThis movie is the rare combination of a film which I can rewatch endlessly, I always find something to make me laugh out loud (it's never the same thing twice), and actually holds up rather well to close scrutiny. It's a wonderful goofball version of a standard 1950s film noir, updated, of course, and never taken seriously. But all the elements are there. It's a terrific spoof of detective movie, but it actually functions successfully as a detective movie. [Compare to \"Airplane\", which is a riotously funny spoof of airplane disaster movies, but only works as a spoof, not as an airplane disaster movie. \"The Big Lebowski\" is making fun of detective movies, but it also has a real mystery involved, and a real detective (albeit an unusual one) who actually solves the mystery.]\n\nGreat performances make this film, and the cast is to die for. See it. If it's not your cup of tea, well, it isn't for everyone. But for my money, this is definitely not only one of the funniest comedies out there, but also one of the best."

I have never been in so many situations where my movie quotes have had to been explained. Clearly, this movie deserves far more recognition. It's the story of how a dude's rug gets pee'd upon and the cascade of events that ensue because of it.\n\nOne of the great things about the movie is that when you are watching it, you know that there is something more than simply the story of a dude and his rug. Speaking of the dude, Jeff Bridges provides an iconic and by far the best performance I have ever seen from him. He is such a laid- back character who garners respect from all his comrades. You really can't help but sympathise with him. He spews some of the best lines heard\u0085 EVER! John Goodman also plays one of the most memorable characters in existence. I feel that that is the thing that makes this movie so incredible. It's characters are immeasurably memorable (even Donnie who does almost nothing). I am going to need surgery to remove the memories of the movie (but I won't because it's excellent).\n\nHmm\u0085 let's see\u0085 negatives. What did this movie do wrong. Perhaps you could argue that some of the characters come to nothing but you would be foolish because it all culminates with the brilliant line 'the dude abides'. It shows that so much has happened that at this point, Jesus (the bowler) doesn't to him. The investigator guy doesn't matter to him and most certainly the teenage car thief doesn't matter to him. I am really struggling here to find things wrong with this movie. The biggest criticism I have is on a purely mood scale. This movie is only watchable if you're in the mood for really thinking about a movie. If you're not\u0085 just watch Anchorman.\n\nClearly, I struggled finding anything wrong with this movie. There is so much to enjoy with the film and I am amazed that I had never watched it prior to a few weeks ago. Even saying it's great to think about deeply can be debunked. There is enough humour and captivating story for you to passively watch it. Just stop reading this review and go to Amazon. Buy the movie. Watch it as soon as possible. Your life will improve."

This is the sort of film that I could watch every week and still find it superb entertainment.

When the Monty Python experience came along in the late 1960's my dad and I used to watch it together. I was almost always helpless with laughter whereas my dad had various expressions on his face from bewilderment to boredom and suffice to say he never did not see the funny side of Python. This is another instance where he would probably be watching this film with a stony face unable or unwilling to grasp what would be so funny to me. Yes there is violence and sexual content but in my opinion it is all in context and not gratuitous but thats just my two cents. Like in a lot of other comedy films you either like them or not and I suspect that there are quite a number of people out there who just cant tune into the humour. I am fortunate in that I can tune in and apart from anything else this film stands on its own and not just a comedic exercise but as a fun story with a reasonable plot told in an unique way. I would highly recommend anyone watch this film because in my opinion there is so much to like and hopefully if you tune in you will not be disappointed"

After another dude peed on it?! So the dude cannot let these transgressions be unaccounted for? Nah. The Dude abides! So with the help of his best friend and bowling partner, Walter Solchek; The Dude pursues rightful payment of said area rug. The repercussions are hilarious. Then there's Jesus and Donnie and Julliane Moore and Flea... Bob Dylan. Just. Perfect."

        "review_detailed_main": "What I think makes 'The Big Lebowski' so great is its attitude and outlook on life and how it can easily resonate with people, especially with a non-confrontational attitude like 'The Dude.' In a world where we try to over-rationalize everything until we don't realize we're creating an altogether new problem which is a byproduct of an already existing issue, 'The Dude' makes everyone else look like a cartoon character or a caricature. To quote what the cowboy said which is basically we all need a hero for its time and place, or I don't know, I kinda forgot what he said. Umm.. Something to that effect.\n\nWhat makes the movie great is you see this guy who gets placed in this sticky situation and how he gets tangled up with all these characters being the opposite with the obvious, Walter, who happens to be his buddy. To see these characters tick is just plain hilarious. And what is also great is watching The Dude just floating through every conversation and every conflict inadvertently making almost everyone else out to be taking themselves too seriously. I did not see the point about the film the first time due to being delirious from working, but upon my second viewing of the film, I found it funny in a way that resonated with my outlook on life.\n\nI think we all yearn to be stoic in the same manner as The Dude, especially in a world in which a lot of people have their head stuck up their asses. To take no bullshit without feeling the need to protect a huge ego is an attribute that everyone should try to aspire to. 'The Big Lebowski' to me is not only a great comedy, but a great film that feels so human and I cannot help but smile with laughter and feel a sense of warmth from watching it. When there are so many characters in movies that feel like they are from an unattainable fantasy dream, we cannot help but alienated from them, and to have a film like 'The Big Lebowski' to bring these characters back down to a human level makes a movie that feels like real life, and at its core, is what makes this film a classic and a film that has a home in my heart forever."

Above par upon first viewing, but the replay value is unmatchable and will eventually wind up at the top of your favorite comedies. Along the lines of other Coen Brothers comedies, but this one is easily the best. Layered with terrific minor characters played by an exceptional supporting cast.

Even Flea (The bass player from the chilli peppers) plays a small role in this but would have been much more worthwhile to just stick to being a bass player than waste time on idiotic side projects like this...\n\nWhy this movie has the cult following it does is beyond me. It literally must be for people who like movies that require no train of thought and dialogue that's riddled with F-bombs, and there are plenty on display especially from John Goodman's character.\n\nAnd what was the point of this movie having a Narrator? Were the Coen brothers just testing the water for Tommy Lee Jones character in No Country For Old Men. They continually use Narrators in their films when they are films that FLAT OUT DO NOT NEED NARRATORS! It's supposed to be a movie, not a wildlife documentary. You're not watching an episode of David Attenborough so drop it with the god damn narrators!!!\n\nAll in all, I simply can't recommend this movie, it's full of pointless dialogue, annoying characters, great actors that have been degraded beyond hell and a bunch of non funny jokes that just don't fit where they belong.

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a cut and paste mishmash of caricatures and stereotypes (as most Coen movies are). The shame is that the caricatures are awkward and insult one's intelligence as well as the targets of the caricatures. They even manage to insult and degrade 1930s musicals. All that might be partially forgivable if it was funny but it never gets past the cringe stage. As for the story. There really isn't one. There is just an excuse to wander from one absurd, meaningless, barely coherent scene to the next. In one sense, it is truly post modern, i.e. there is no meaning, no theme other than impossible, dysfunctional characters thrown together to no purpose and you cannot feel good about any of it or take away anything useful from watching them.\n\nCritics and people in the industry seem to give not just the benefit of the doubt to the Coen brothers. Any paint they throw at a wall is hyped and sold as some kind of high art. But there might be method to that madness. If this kind of thing can be elevated to high art, it allows anything slapped together with a splash to be likewise elevated. In the mean time, movies as an art form and a cultural expression are down graded again while presumably the profits continue to flow. If that is what is going on, then this movie starts to make sense.\n\nThe only redeeming things I can see about this movie is that John Goodman tried to do something with the wretched material he was given and Sam Elliot just manages to maintain his dignity as the writing and directing attempts to drag him down into ridiculousness. But if I think about it too long, I might conclude that they became caricatures of themselves. Again, that might be forgivable if it was funny, but it isn't.\n\nAs for Jeff Bridges, he seems to be deliberately trying to act badly, i.e. blatantly artificial. To what end, I am not sure. Did the directors want that? Possibly, the Coen brothers have certainly used unnatural characters before.\n\nDid Juliane Moore enjoy her incomprehensible role? It didn't make sense even in the vacuous context of the movie.\n\nPlease don't fall for the hype. See garbage for what it is. This is not classic or significant in any positive sense."

It's a comedy, but also exhibits western and noir attributes as The Dude navigates his entanglements. Meanwhile, the film sneaks in relevant social and political classism critiques. Plus, this is all unified by spiritual messages of surrender. These ingredients could've been messy, but the Coens find balance, subtly suggesting themes with potent details. Furthermore, the cast wholly embodies their eccentric characters. Thus, The Big Lebowski is a thoughtful journey that, fittingly, can be enjoyed without noticing its undertones.\n\nTechnically, The Big Lebowski has cunning style. The precise direction captures an outlandish atmosphere and nonchalant tone. It rarely feels overtly artistic, yet there's a lurking sense of deeper meaning. The visuals provide hypnotic transitions, elaborate dreams, and dramatic montages. These moments are further supported by careful editing, which also keeps the runtime tight and punctuates comedy. The sound is symbolically abstract, the production is iconic, and the effects heighten the surrealism. Lastly, the music fuses humor with thematic weight. Overall, The Big Lebowski is a joyful and deceptively substantial experience, definitively earning its modern classic status.\n\nWriting: 10/10 Direction: 10/10 Cinematography: 8/10 Acting: 9/10 Editing: 9/10 Sound: 9/10 Score/Soundtrack: 10/10 Production Design: 8/10 Casting: 10/10 Effects: 8/10\n\nOverall Score: 9.1/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Coen Brothers already made a name for themselves after the release of their film's like Raising Arizona, Barton Fink, and most recently Fargo in 1996 at the time. So when The Big Lebowski came out I'm sure they were all over this film. The film is in no way bad, but it's definitely a movie that isn't for everyone. Besides the strange characters, the plot is equally as weird and is a little hard to elaborate. But really, the film is one to laugh out loud too. Both leads in this film are portrayed fantastically and are very funny when on screen alone and simultaneously. Bridges' character \"The Dude\" is one of the best characters in any Coen Brothers film.\n\nWhen it comes to Jeff Bridges, I don't know a lot. I do like him for his underrated role he played in K-PAX, but this is only, I believe, the second film I've seen with him. He's great at doing a Comedy film. When he gets into character with the LA slacker accent he can be a thrill to watch. He drops some funny one liners in this picture and is also accompanied greatly by John Goodman who plays Walter. When the duo appear on screen the laughs keep coming and coming and the humor rarely lets up.\n\nThe plot involves an unmotivated slacker nicknamed \"The Dude\" (Bridges) demands Jeffrey Lebowski (The Big Lebowski) to give him a new rug after his was urinated on by two robbers who were looking for a person by the same name as \"The Dude's\" (Jeffrey Lebowski). His request is declined but he is contacted again when Lebowski's trophy wife is kidnapped and after a series of events The Dude and Walter must return the ransom in order to get the wife back.\n\nThe Big Lebowski isn't really my type of film. The Coen Brothers never were my type either. I was never really into their films and am into a much more different tone of Comedy. This Comedy, while being well done and funny, is also a little bit of annoying too because of how long it is. The movie could be trimmed around maybe twenty minutes in my opinion. It doesn't need to span close to two hours. Sort of reminds me of Dinner for Schmucks how it almost runs two hours to say that since it's long it's better. Not true for any movie.\n\nOne of TBL's high points are the character performances by John Goodman and Jeff Bridges. Both characters are insanely funny and very amusing to watch on screen as well. I am really fond of \"The Dude\" character and he throws in very amusing and clicking lines in the films as well. I enjoyed the end scene and the way the movie ended too. I guess what I'm trying to say is that The Big Lebowski has ups and downs, but really, it's a movie you need to try out. It may not be for everyone, but it does have it's share of humor.\n\nThe last thing I need to say is this is a film I don't think I'd watch again. Various films I've reviewed recently I've went back to and rewatched again for the hell of it and some movies I even watch for an occasional third time. Naked Fear I've watched once more since I reviewed it and I gave Eve's Beach Fantasy another try and couldn't make it through the first ten minutes. I don't know if I can watch this film again just for the hell of it because I believe I got the full entertainment value the first time around. While it's well made, I'm sure I'll come back to it in later years, but not anytime soon, but clips I can assure you will be revisited. The Big Lebowski is a highly enjoyable film. While not being what I expected, it still had a great cast and various scenes with lots of humor. I think I can say, it certainly does abide.\n\nStarring: Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, and Julianne Moore. Directed by Joel and Ethan Coen."

        "review_detailed_main": "For fun, I wondered who would give this film a no star. I find it fascinating that when I see a great film and others see a terrible one, a Battlefield Earth, what causes the discrepancy? Is it perhaps they're humorless or lack the capacity to \"get it?\" The investigation was interesting. The reviewers seemed articulate much of the time and not mere trolls. Yet, they hated the Dude. The whole thing. Every character. They were bored. They felt it was stupid.\n\nSo perhaps here's why a few people can't \"get\" the Dude: They just don't like him. They didn't like the characters. The nihilists ordering \"piggie in the blankets\" or a Vietnam vet whose converted to Judaism and watches his ex-wife's dog. The film has a wonderful backstory that invites you to fill in the gaps with similar characters in your own life and fiction. It's full of rich details but if you don't like one, or more, of the characters, then it's like listening to colleagues you dislike at work prattle on about their facebook posts. They don't get it and don't care and just want to leave.\n\nThe genius of the film is that many people who don't see the humor on the first viewing a few years later see it again, perhaps on TV as their spouse or friend is watching it, and realize: \"I missed that the first time around. That's pretty funny and insightful.\" Then they watch some more. Then more. Then they're hooked.\n\nThe Dude is not for the faint of heart. You would NOT want the Dude to move in with you. He'd burn down the house because he forgot to turn off the oven but, hey, stop being so fascist about it will ya? But even if you want some distance between you and him, you come to love him and his troupe of characters that are simultaneously stereotypes, both in fiction and real life, and at the same time unique characters in their own right. The Dude says you need to stop being so uptight, relax, and get it. Or not. And when someone gets uptight and doesn't get it, they don't get it. And they are the ones who write 0 star reviews of this film on IMDb.\n\nA few years down the road, they'll have a few drinks in them and relax and watch it and then they'll change. Maybe they'll fix their 0 star IMDb review. Maybe they'll apologize to the Dude but the Dude is OK with that. He has far more important things to do."

Steve Busemi, (Jeffrey Lebowski) gives a great supporting role. This is a great comedy filled with all kinds of surprises and plenty of shocking words thrown back and forth with each of the actors."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not sure The Big Lebowski is for everyone, but for my money it's one of the funniest comedies ever, a very impressive production from the Coen Brothers.\n\nOver the years, the Coens have knocked my socks off. They have their heavy-duty films like No Country for Old Men, Barton Fink, and their satires like the Hudsucker Proxy - it seems as if they can do anything.\n\nThis is a very, very funny and offbeat film with crazy characters, acid flashbacks, and bizarre situations -- a true baby boomer movie about The Dude (Jeff Bridges) whose name is Jeff Lebowski, who is mistaken for another Lebowski whose wife owes money all over town. Goons try to get the money from him; he winds up working for the other Lebowski when his porn star wife is kidnapped. Along for the ride are two of his bowling buddies, Walter, a Vietnam vet who, though not Jewish, observes the shabbat, and Steve (Steve Buscemi). Julianne Moore plays Maude, the daughter of the Big Lebowski.\n\nMy favorite part of the movie -- I have many, but my favorite part is one of the last scenes which I won't give away. The acting is fantastic, with Jeff Bridges totally inhabiting the Dude and John Goodman in one of his best performances.\n\nA flop when it opened, over the years, The Big Lebowski has deservedly become a classic as it found its audience. It's now rated in the top 250 on IMDb, which is only right."

The humor is sparse as far as I'm concerned, with John Goodman's character being the only redeeming part of the entire movie.\n\nYeah, I paid attention. And I watched it twice. It didn't help.\n\nSome people have raved over the joke that the main character's rug \"Really tied the room together\". If that is what passes for great humor, well count me out."

Take Turturro for example who plays a latino bowling player named Jesus with such perfect acting so I can\u00b4t help laughing.So if you\u00b4re looking for a very twisted and well played comedy this is the one to see.

Examples include the darkness which falls at the scene of a disasterous event outside the bowling alley in the second half. Another is the jump cut to an exploding firework used when The Dude is punched whilst lying on his new rug. The trails of light from the firework then morph seamlessly into an aeriel view of the lights on the streets of LA at night. Amazing stuff.\n\nVisuals are great, but when not backed up with equally good dialogue you can end up with a George Lucas movie. The dialogue in this film is at times nothing short of astonishing. John Goodman's character, Walter, is a Vietnam veteran with excellent vocabulary, historical awareness, philosophical ability; all shot through with tirades of foul language. He is both hilarious and thought provoking, much like the film as a whole.\n\nWith a supporting cast of John Turturro, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, David Huddleston, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Peter Stormare and Tara Reid; the movie shimmers with comic timing and great acting.\n\nIt's one of the best. Easily said I know, but in this case it's true."

The plot of the movie is virtually nonexistent, and the dialogue is horrendous, mostly consisting of the f-word. By far the most obnoxious character is Walter, played by John Goodman, whose incessant uttering of the phrase \"Am I wrong?\" began grating on my nerves within the first twenty minutes. This movie is, while perhaps not the worst movie I've ever seen, definitely near the bottom of the barrel."

John Goodman's performance as Walter is Oscar material, and definitely my favorite character of any movie I've ever seen, from giving his choice words to Donny to relating just about everything that happens to Vietnam. The conversations at the bowling alley are classics. In 1998, I saw two of the best comedies I've ever seen: There's Something About Mary, and The Big Lebowski, and The Big Lebowski wins hands down.

This is basically a post-modern tale that anyone growing up in the 90's will understand. Everyone should find this entertaining, especially on re-runs on all the networks. It requires attention span as the story is rather complicated. It also has a great number of characters to introduce. But the filmmakers do it so well that it doesn't lose any points. I didn't give it a 10 because it is so outlandish and over-the-top that even the most gullible will want to walk away from it at times. There is a character, played by John Turturro, who is a registered sex offender, who plays bowling alongside the three main characters in league bowling, and they felt the need to do a cut-scene to tell his story, even though he is only in one scene. Also, there is the guy who is a stage actor, who wants the Dude to go to his performance, and the dude nearly forgets - this character has nothing at all to do with this movie, so the scenes changed about every 2 minutes!!! Also, John Goodman's character getting away with threatening to shoot someone in public, and the cops show up and somehow miss him!! Way too over-the-top. It felt at times like a pornographic display of garishness."

Not so far, at least!\n\nJohn Goodman was also great if not the funniest character in this movie! His character is just brilliant! A guy that turned Jewish since he's married his wife who left him, always talking about Vietnam and about how he saw his friends with their faces in the mud even when they're talking about potatoes for instance, and so on... and so on... I can't find any mistakes in this film except that i would have really loved to see a bit more of Steve Buscemi!\n\nThe script and the directing are also great as expected from Coen Brothers. Violence is just in line. Not overdone and not underdone. And the music is just brilliant!!!!\n\nThis is a well packed, very well written mix of black comedy and a thriller that's way too intelligent to be dumb and way too dumb to be intelligent!

        "review_detailed_main": "What a ludicrous story. Absolutely bizarre in every way, and all the better for it. It was an absolute farce and there no sense or logic to much of it. All of this makes it very hard not to love The Big Lebowski.\n\nThe characters were so rich and eccentric that I really didn't know what was going to happen or why it was going to happen. The Coen's are experts in keeping you on your toes during a film. Just when you think things are going to zig the plot goes right ahead and zags. I absolutely love this style of story, and if you are a fan of the Coen's other work, particularly Fargo, this will be right up your street due to the similar levels of farce and buffoonery.\n\nBridges and Goodman were electric, with such good oddball chemistry between them. The sharp script was excellently delivered by both, handling comedy and drama equally well. Buscemi was a fantastic support as expected but the real standout aside from Bridges and Goodman was Julianne Moore. She was an absolute scene stealer whenever she was on screen, adding another great oddball character to the mix. Philip Seymour Hoffman as well! The list goes on, but suffice to say the cast was eclectic and excellent.\n\nThe Big Lebowski is wildly entertaining, although I must say I never really found it hilarious. Sure it was funny in parts, and there were laughs to be had, but it was never laugh out loud funny for me. Maybe some of the humour didn't age so well I'm not sure, for example the character of Jesus. Still funny but not as hilarious as it perhaps was 20 years ago. The Coen's deal more in black comedy and farce anyway, so I found myself smirking a sufficient amount which is a good sign.\n\nAs you'd expect from the Coen's the direction was pretty slick. Arty, surreal, and clean in equal measure. To top it all off there was a pretty popping soundtrack.\n\nThe Big Lebowski is a hoot! Probably one of the greatest collection of odd characters and the most absurd of plots combine to make a triumphant piece of cinema."

        "review_detailed_main": "'THE BIG LEBOWSKI' was directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, and stars Jeff Bridges, John Goodman and Julian Moore. When 'The Dude'(Jeff Bridges) is mistaken for Jeffrey Lebowski(David Huddleston), his life becomes a lot more complicated than before.\n\nWord of Advice: watch this movie while intoxicated. I watched it while sober and still enjoyed it immensely but I guarantee that watching this movie while off your head will improve it. That said, this is a very enjoyable comedy. Jeff Bridges shines bright as 'The Dude' with an excellent cast, including John Goodman and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, also providing great performances and being the potatoes to this meat and potato pie. The comedy is pretty good and I'll definitely say that more jokes hit than they do fail. That said, I won't say that many jokes in this movie are hysterically funny; I chuckled a lot but I only full on laughed out loud maybe 2 or 3 times. That isn't a massive gripe but it's something I though I should mention.\n\nMy main gripe with this movie is that being intoxicated is probably the best way to see it, and that is not a major gripe at all. The story is pretty basic but works well for what it is attempting to do. Despite this, they set up a lot of character and story arcs that go NOWHERE which was really annoying. That is my second major flaw with this movie. It sets up interesting characters like Jesus and even Donnie but then ignores them or even completely forgets them for the majority of the plot. I would rather the characters not be in the movie, than have them in it for only a minuscule amount of time. The ending(which I love by the way) is very open and allows a lot more possibilities for sequels where they could have explored these characters more and gave them more depth instead of cramming them all into this one movie.\n\nEven with these flaws, the movie is very damn enjoyable. Its incredible, colourful, imaginative characters really drive the movie and they are what makes this movie shine. That is why I wanted more time going to some of the supporting roles. A lot of effort was clearly put into these characters and I wish they got more screen time to bloom.\n\nIt's a very technically proficient movie; the cinematography is pretty good. The set and costume design is great. I have no real flaws with this movie as far as sets and camera-work goes. Maybe a few changes to character and set design but I can't say it was anything that really hindered my enjoyment.\n\nAll in all, this movie is very enjoyable sober(and I imagine even more so while on something) therefor I do recommend this movie to anyone, so long as you're prepared to possibly have a breakdown during a few sequences of this movie. It's a very enjoyable movie, and I'll rate it 8 rugs out of 10."

It is funny, weird and incredibly quotable. The characters are well drawn and so odd that you can't help but love them. The Coen brothers have made some very good movies but nothing compares to the utter genius displayed here.\n\nThe Big Lebowski exists on the plain of earth that we just don't inhabit. In this film LA is a magical place that walks the along edge of lunacy. A bit mythological and just subversive to keep us coming back again and again for a great movie that never loses it's sparkle.\n\nThe Dude Abides..."

        "review_detailed_main": "As far as I'm concerned this is easily the very best movie the incredible Coen brothers have made to date. Comedy is one of the most difficult, demanding genres around, and in order for it to work it must be made with a professionalism that exceeds all imagination. Now that's one of the many great things about \"The Big Lebowski\". Everything in this movie is sheer genius, every detail is right, and the timing is perfect, but it feels so laidback you hardly notice the brilliance and skill.\n\nWhat else can I say ? The Dude is just about the coolest main character you can possibly imagine, and he's surrounded by a hilarious troupe of supporting characters that make this film a truly worthwile event. Walter Sobchak, Donnie, the three nihilists, the Jesus, Maude, Jackie Treehorn, Brandt, Knox Harrington ... they're all hysterically funny. Same goes for the nonsensical situations The Dude gets into. The first appereance of the Jesus, the farret scene, the toilet scene (\"Where's the money Lebowski ?\"), the confrontation on the parking lot, the money handover, the beach scene, and so many more wonderful moments - I'll kick myself for not mentioning them later... they can make anyone with a sense of humour howl with laughter, again and again and again.\n\nThe cast is tremendous: Jeff Bridges is in my opinion one of the best American actors around and as The Dude, he finally got the chance to show what a remarkable comedian he really is. John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro, Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman... each and every one of them gives a new meaning to the word \"delicious\".\n\nIn short, this movie is such a feast of wonderful dialogues, hilarious characters and unbelievably funny scenes it's already a true classic. The Dude abides, man, The Dude abides..."

        "review_title": "Among The Greatest of American Comedies",
        "review_detailed_main": "To me, the three funniest American movies ever made are A NIGHT AT THE OPERA, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, and THE BIG LEBOWSKI.\n\nIt's really interesting to notice the similarities between the three movies. YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is a spoof of classic horror movies from the thirties. THE BIG LEBOWSKI is a spoof of classic detective movies from the thirties and forties. Both movies totally capture the feel of the original genre and feel authentic even when being deliberately funny. The Dude is a lot like the Monster, a slow and clumsy but basically good-hearted character who spends most of the movie stumbling around not quite knowing what is going on, while the hysterical characters all around him create bizarre complications.\n\nAlso, notice that both YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN and THE BIG LEBOWSKI feature show-stopping musical numbers, each of which come out of nowhere and feature the rumpled, clumsy main character suddenly recast as a dapper song and dance man. \"Puttin' On the Ritz\" and \"Just Stopped In (To See What Condition My Condition Is In\") are both numbers that take an already successful comedy and push it into the realm of a total classic.\n\nA lot of the humor in THE BIG LEBOWSKI parallels the humor of A NIGHT AT THE OPERA. In both movies, wealthy society people attempt to boss around deadbeats and eccentrics, who soon turn the tables and create all kinds of mischief. Maude Lebowski, with her artistic tastes, cheerful snobbery, and fundamentally gullible nature, is a perfect update of the well-to-do women Margaret Dumont always played in the Marx Brothers classic comedies. The difference is that Maude is never, ever reduced to the role of a simple straight man (or woman.) Indeed, her wit is often a lot sharper than the Dude's. (\"The dialog is inane, and the plot ludicrous . . . of course you can imagine where it goes from here.\" \"He fixes the cable?\" \"Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.\")\n\nThis brings up the final point I want to make about THE BIG LEBOWSKI. There are no straight men. There are no small parts. Every single character is funny and the effect is dazzling. Whereas Groucho has to be the funniest character in every scene, the Dude himself is often allowed to step back and allow the weirdness of others to shine. This is what makes THE BIG LEBOWSKI a unique comedy masterpiece.\n\nSo what keeps this movie from being a perfect ten? The ending is a little anti-climactic, and the death of a major character dampens the impact. Also the use of the cowboy character in the bowling alley (and as a narrator) struck me as being an annoying distraction."

        "review_detailed_main": "Review: 'The Big Lebowski' 'The Big Lebowski' by the Coen brothers is a great film because of its great characters. The cast includes Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, John Turturro and many more. 'The Big Lebowski' released in 1998 is a quirky crime comedy about an unemployed slacker from L.A who is drawn into a world of kidnapping after being mistaken for a washed up millionaire of the same name. To summarize it 'The Big Lebowski' is about 'The Dude' a slacker and a keen bowler, when two enforcers show up at his house demanding money, having mistook him for a millionaire with the same name and urinating on his carpet, he is plunged into a world of deceit, kidnapping and much more in the pursuit to be compensated for his ruined carpet. A summary of the plot does not do this film justice. The character of 'The Dude' is brought to life by the outstanding performance of Jeff Bridges. The dude has so many hilarious quotes and back and forths with his counterpart 'Walter' played by John Goodman. Jeff Bridges seamlessly plays 'The Dude' with laid back perfection. I was disappointed though with Steve Buscemi's character 'Donny' having very few lines in the film although whenever he does talk he is usually told to shut up which can be quite funny. Another film by the Coen brothers called 'Fargo' has Steve Buscemi in a much bigger role than in this one and he is excellent in 'Fargo'. I would have preferred if he was given a bigger role like in 'Fargo'. John Turturro has a hilarious performance as 'Jesus' but little screen time. During the film's spectacular dream sequences are used with great effect. The soundtrack for the film is very good too. In conclusion 'The Big Lebowski' is more about the characters than the plot. I would recommend this film too everyone and I would give it a 9/10. It is my favourite Coen brothers' film and my favourite film with Jeff Bridges in it that I have seen."

Now that I think of it, the dream sequences were surreal enough to be interesting, especially the bit with a POV of the inside of a bowling ball!\n\nMy friend who recommended it replied to my objections by saying, \"Oh, maybe I forgot to mention that this is a movie best watched stoned.\" Yeah... maybe.

It wasn't his fault someone urinated on his rug, but thats only the beginning of this laugh out loud comedy from the people who brought you FARGO.\n\nThe Coen Brothers got so much critical acclaim for their previous film, that they decided to mix it up here. And they did, some critics loved it, some hated it, after seeing Fargo I have to admit it wasn't what I expected. But they roll enough solid laughs and camera tricks to satisfy even the most vengeful critic (get over it, they wanted to do a comedy, and they did it better then most).\n\nScoring a perfect 300 is THE DUDE. He is the guy you wish you could be if you had the guts to throw all responsibility behind you and enjoy life not caring what people think of you or what you do. The Dude never was shown rolling a bowling ball during the movie despite most of it taking place during a bowling match involving him.\n\nAnd also scoring a perfect 300 (may-be he won't shoot me) is Walter played by John Goodman. Never better or louder, Goodman plays a Volcanic Vietnam Vet, who shouts paranoid logic and profanity.\n\nSteve Buscemi may have had a good score but every time he tried to talk Walter told him to shut the ____ up, So I give him a 250. Hey what can I say, he played the \"loser in the group\" better than most.\n\nAnd last but not least, a 200 to John Turturro who played a Hispanic pedophile bowling champ named Jesus.\n\nPete's Movie Rating (out of 10): 9"

It has been said that every individual has an individual personality but along with the dawn of this beautiful new Coen Brothers film is also the realization that there is not one person on this green old earth that can make it through \"The Big Lebowski\" without laughing. It is packed so tight with jokes that it'll make your grandadie's constipation look like a piece of cake. If you don't like this film or rate it anywhere below a 7 that is fine, for at that point of clicking the \"vote\" button with 7 or below you shall finally find that you are indeed retarded. Proceed to the doctor's immediately for treatment, because if you rate this film 7 or below you are in need of medical attention. Personal opinions are laid to rest!"

This is an 'awesome' movie (,man) and it is unique in the way it brings bottom-of-the-belly laughing (or: the instinctive, natural type of laughter if you'd like) to a modern genre that's hard to associate with humor. One of the best I've ever seen besides Jim Jarmusch's Down by Law. Not that it's comparable, but...\n\nIn short, it's a very funny, yet intellectual look at life through the eyes of the bozos that we all are. Go see it!"

By the third time I was hysterical! This movie has so many in-jokes and funny scenes you simply will not catch them all in one sitting.\n\nThe story itself as a crime movie is absolutely brilliant. Never have I seen so many characters involved in one plot so well, and all because of a rug! (well, partially). Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, and Steve Buscemi give a magnificent performance, and their friendship on screen as a group of guys doing nothing but bowl and drink beer is one to admire. \"The Dude\" is probably one of the coolest characters ever created, but to be fair, everyones character has been remarkably developed.\n\nThis movie is hilarious and if you are looking for something \"chilled\" and funny then this is it dude!\n\nRating -5 out of 5-"

Decent enough plotline and story, but really, the acting was OTT. And, sorry, Julianne Moore, that accent was more Dick van Dyke than Mary Poppins.\n\nSo, to summarise: meh!"

Bridges is perfectly cast as 'The Dude', the easy-going, laid-back kind of guy who spends his time bowling, smoking weed and listening to his Creedance-tapes. Goodman as Vietnam-veteran Walter who sees a conspiracy in almost everything and doesn't want to be bothered on \"his\" Jewish holidays comes up with another great performance as well as Buscemi, Moore, Seymour Hoffman and Turturro (in a very small, but entertaining role as bowling-king Jesus). And then there is Elliott as The Stranger who says he hasn't heard of a story as stupifying as this one. I couldn't agree more. Great writing, superb acting and a terrifying marmot!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This film shines like a great big ball of burning gas in the sky, providing all who live beneath its great shining beauty with warmth and light and happiness. It truly is one of the most amazingly brilliant masterpieces ever made, packed with visual and verbal invention, skill and class. Every second, every frame is simply magical, from the grimy milky toilet of the opening scene through all those wonderfully colourful, crazy dream sequences to the final pan of the camera away from our heroes, a riot of colour, imagery and beauty. The story is a wonderfully rambling, sprawling tale based loosely on Raymond Chandler and old Bogey movies, packed with Chandler staples and nods to great classic film noir, the characters are all brilliantly conceived, written and played. Bridges and Goodman make a truly classic odd-buddy combination, Buscemi and Turturro play wonderful minor comic figures wonderfully, Julianna Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, David Thewlis, the list of great actors playing out of their skins goes on and on. The music is perfect, Sam Eliot's narration is awe-inspiring (who else could possibly have played that part?), but above all it is the visual splendour of every scene which makes this film really stand out. What the Coens have created here will last forever as one of the very last great cinematic achievements of the Twentieth century, and sets a standard towards which all future filmmakers will have to stretch themselves to the utmost to reach. A truly flawless film which leaves the viewer with a lasting sense of pleasure and satisfaction and even manages to improve with each successive viewing, The Big Lebowski deserves every possible award and recognition available, and should be seen by every sensible person on the planet as often as possible. Only through this can true world peace and prosperity be achieved."

        "review_detailed_main": "As I look over the other comments for the Coen Brothers' film, _The Big Lebowski_, I see that I am not alone in my appreciation. When I first saw this film in the theater, it was a bit of a let-down, coming on the heels of the brilliant _Fargo_ (one of the greatest American films of the last 20 years, and that's no understatement). But when I first rented it on home video, I was sucked in by the charm and the atmosphere of the film.\n\nIt has such a laid-back, easygoing style that I can see how it might not appeal to those looking for nonstop action. But if you're willing to surrender to the peculiar charms of this film, you too might begin to see it for the work of genius it is. I've since purchased the film on video and have watched it several more times--it really is a film that grows on you and it is hilarious to boot.\n\nJohn Goodman has never been better than in the role of the insufferable Walter, who knows everything and will never admit he's wrong, even when he clearly is. But he's a true friend to the Dude, played by Jeff Bridges, and Donny, played by Steve Buscemi. The three of them are bowling buddies, and in the course of preparing for the big tournament, they get pulled into a weird little mixup involving a carpet, a wayward wife, and the Big Lebowski, who just happens to have the same name as Bridge's character.\n\nI've seen this described elsewhere as a sort of anti-mystery and that's one way of enjoying it. Imagine Jeff Bridges as a sort of stoned, clueless Philip Marlowe, stumbling through his investigation. The comedy though is just so relaxed and unforced, unlike that in the Coens' _Raising Arizona_, a film I've never been able to watch. The acting in this film is amazing, with a cast of independent film allstars.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I wonder if this film might not be just that much better than _Fargo_. If not, it's a very close second. If you rent the film and it doesn't appeal to you at first, give it a chance--you might find that it grows on you, too."

It is not until seeing it again that the movie does not make sense. I urge anyone who has seen this movie once, to rent it, and watch it again, it will be worth it.
