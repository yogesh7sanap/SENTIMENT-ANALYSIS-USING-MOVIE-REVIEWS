I'm not sure how a movie so god-awful can make it to screen, but my faith in the system has been shaken. The film isn't funny, I'm not sure if it tries to be or not, but it's not. It references other movies (Meet the Parents, When Harry met Sally etc.) but doesn't really spoof them. This was the biggest problem I believe, as it doesn't have any semblance of flow or sense. Random scenes pop up, trying to get a laugh by basically reenacting the scene, not exaggerating it or making fun of it. I managed to sit through House of the Dead, but this film actually made me angry it was so unfunny. Please skip it, have one of your friends go see it instead and then ask about it. If they don't knock your teeth out for setting them up to lose money and 90 minutes of their life, then you can go see it yourself."

I mean very high. I am a sucker for the parody genre. Ever since The Naked Gun films and Airplane!, Wrongfully Accused, Spy Hard, Scary Movie.. I've been a nut for these types of movies. So why was this one so bad? I can't really explain.. I saw all the movies they parodied, and still.. it just wasn't funny. I am absolutely in love with Alyson Hannigan. She's a very beautifal and very talented actress. Eddie Griffin is one of the funniest comedians to grace the silver screen in years. And please, Lil' Jon is in the movie! What's not to like? Well, the fact that basically, a lot of the parodies were just word for word retellings of some of the movies. The dinner scene was an ENTIRE ripoff of the Meet the Parents scene to a t. This movie tries too hard to be funny, and at sometimes its okay (the Pimp My Ride scene comes to mind), but honestly.. it just tries too hard and doesn't go anywhere. I can't say I was disappointed, it was beyond that. If there's a sequel to this atrocious comedy I'll eat my hat."

It's not sufficient to just throw a bunch of stolen scenes together in the hope that the conjunction will generate humour by itself. I honestly could not see one - not ONE - original thought or idea or line in the script or direction. That in itself is something of an achievement. The whole thing plays like it was scripted by teenagers, and not teenagers from the top end of the grade curve.\n\nIn fact, I have to wonder if this films is deliberately aimed at the lowest common denominator. If so, it missed by several yards to the south."

        "review_title": "Just when you thought Hollywood has reached an all time low, you get \"Date Movie.\"",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Date Movie\" is a movie that spoofs romantic comedies. The movie follows Julia Jones (Alyson Hannigan) as she goes through all the events that take place in order to marry her prince Grant (Adam Campbell). This process involves meeting the parents, breaking up, meeting the ex-girlfriend, planning the wedding and everything else that the romantic comedy genre has thrown our way. Laughs are supposed to ensue\u0085\n\nJust when you thought Hollywood has reached an all time low comes \"Date Movie,\" a movie that proves that anything can be made into a film in Hollywood and no matter how bad something is people will dish out their hard earned money to see it. \"Date Movie\" is by far the worst pile of crap I have seen in several years and can possibly go down in the history of film as being one of the worst movies ever made.\n\nThis movie contained zero laughs, none of the spoofs were even remotely funny. It was an insult to anyone who dished out any kind of money to see this film. The saddest part about all of this is that I knew before seeing this movie that it was going to be bad but I didn't think it could ever be as bad as it actually was. All the jokes fell flat and half way through its groundbreaking 75 minute running time I wanted to find a way to end my life so I wouldn't have to sit through another second of this horrid movie.\n\nThere really isn't a positive thing I can say about this movie. The first question that comes to mind though is who the hell came up with the idea. Why spoof comedies? Comedies are already funny so why spoof them? This is a question I wondered when I first heard about the movie and now after seeing \"Date Movie\" I know it can't be done and shouldn't even be attempted. While \"Date Movie\" only runs 75 minutes they try to spoof everything they can including Bridget Jones's Diary, Kill Bill, Say Anything, My Best Friend's Wedding, Napoleon Dynamite, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Hitch, The Bachelor, Meet the Parents, Sleepless in Seattle, Rize, King Kong, Wedding Planner and so many more. You would think that one joke would work but in all honesty not a single one did. You just sit there staring at the screen, losing your brain cells, and wondering how on earth someone got money to produce this pile of garbage.\n\nI guess you should know that a movie is really bad when it's not screened for critics and the trailer tries to sell you a movie by saying \"from 2 of the 6 writers of Scary Movie\" but there is always that small part of me that says it can't be as bad as it looks but in this case it's worse than it looks. It's a train wreck and if anyone finds this movie funny I am sorry but there must be something seriously wrong with you or you are just so incredibly immature.\n\nThis movie took 2 people to write and two people to direct. If I ever meet Jason Friedberg or Aaron Seltzer the writers and directors behind this crap I will demand that they give me my $6.75 back for paying to see this movie. These guys have no right what so ever to make a movie when they put out a movie like \"Date Movie.\" There should be a law in Hollywood that if your movie is hated by both critics and audiences alike that you should be placed in a cell and beaten until you write everyone who watched your film a huge letter of apology. I really wonder what crap can come out of Hollywood next that can be worse than this film.\n\nSo to sum it up, \"Date Movie\" sucks, plain and simple. Even if you see it with little or no expectations you will be disappointed. I despise everyone who was involved with this movie from the entire cast who somehow read this script and said this is going to be good to the interns who didn't walk off the set after the first day of shooting. Why is it that we have to suffer through movies that are this bad? And Hollywood wonders why ticket sales are going down because when you pay $6-$10 to see a movie like \"Date Movie\" I can totally understand why people aren't going and would be leery of what Hollywood puts out. This is the worst film to come out of Hollywood in years even worse than \"Gigli,\" \"Batman and Robin\" and \"You Got Served.\"\n\nMovieManMenzel's final rating for \"Date Movie\" is a 0 out of ten. This movie doesn't even deserve a 1 because nothing worked at all and people shouldn't have to be tortured like this when they see a movie."

The story is about Julia Jones a lonely girl who just wants the perfect romance but her father wants hr to marry a Chinese-German Jew or something like that. She then meets the love of her life and all is well until his ex fianc\u00e9e comes into the picture. I recommend this film over Epic Movie and Meet The Spartans for it is funny and direct but they still can not get away from thinking that dancing from famous characters is really funny.

I admit, I laughed during the Napoleon Dynamite skit, but that was probably the only funny scene in the whole film.\n\nThis film is stupid, but not stupid in a funny way. It is stupid in an EXTREMELY boring way. The only (barely) entertaining parts of the movie were in the first 10 minutes. The rest of it was filler as the scriptwriter probably ran out of dumb ideas.\n\nI, along with probably most of the audience, felt like leaving on the spot.

It was full of disgusting jokes, and not just in a sexual way. I was surprised anyone even bothered making this movie. About 45 minutes in, I was disgusted and bored. My friends were, too. I'm not the type to walk out during a movie. I never have before, but this movie was a waste of my time, the 11 bucks I spent on the ticket, and the five bucks I spent on popcorn/ candy.

What might actually seem like a good couple of laughs, at least judging from the trailers, actually falls apart fairly quickly.

        "review_detailed_main": "People really need to realize that in order for a parody to be good, it has to be cheesy and in other words, bad. I know it's a paradox, but that is the only genre it is actually applied to. I was surprised to see the average rating of all newer parody stuff on IMDb: Date Movie, Meet the Spartans, Epic Movie, Vampires Suck, etc. They all have 2.something average rating and it's mostly because people are not well informed on the whole concept of this genre.\n\nFor a parody to be successful, it has to take elements from real life and/or movies/other media that are seemingly serious, but cheesy, little overrated, over the top, inaccurate, ignorant, full of prejudice... etc. So, the good mocking of this just HAS to go a bit further to make the vague inaccuracies more obvious and laughable. I think that this movie succeeded in that. Everything that is bad or over the top is INTENDED to be so, hence, planned and I like it.\n\nAlyson Hannigan and Adam Campbell have good chemistry and acting skills and I enjoyed their performances very much. Adam is an underrated actor and he needs more recognition overall. Also, the cast is full of talented parody performers, like Jennifer Coolidge, Eddie Griffin and Tony Cox.\n\nFor anyone who doesn't particularly find romantic comedies good, and considers them cheesy and overrated, this is the film. It's particular 'victims' are precisely romantic comedies, mostly My Best Friend's Wedding, Meet the Fockers, Wedding Planner, Hitch, Bridget Jones' Diary, My Big Fat Greek Wedding and most wedding films.\n\nAlyson Hanigan's character is named Julia Jones, parody of Bridget Jones and Julia Roberts, and Adam Campbell plays Grant Fockyourdaughter, parody of Hugh Grant and Fockers. Sophie Monk's character is parody of Julia Roberts in My Best Friend's Wedding and typical 'bitch' characters, Tony Cox is Hitch, Julia's family is mostly parody of My Big Fat Greek Wedding family with all national prejudice in it. All the characters are hilarious and deliver their puns on time. I was laughing all the time, it's so on spot about all romantic clich\u00e9s. The moment at the end, with all the most cheesy love declarations ever is my favorite, I can't restrain from laughing hard at that point.\n\nAlso the films contains Jinxters, the most disgusting cat you just have to LOVE! Let's just mention he doesn't restrain from gerentophilia and necrophilia. His scenes are so disgustingly nauseous, but one of the funniest ever! I will probably never get tired of watching this and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves good laughter and mocking romantic clich\u00e9s.\n\nIt's 9/10 in everything it was supposed to be no matter what critic say!"

But despite the fact I wanted to hate it, and despite the fact it really was awful, I still feel fairly entertained. And best of all, the film was really short (roughly 73 minutes).\n\nThe bad: The is film is nothing more than 50 other movies (mostly romances or chick flicks) strung together in a very exaggerated way. So if you are looking for something unique, this is the last place you want to check. The acting is also rather poor, and the soundtrack seems to be just Kelis and the Pussycat Dolls repeated over and over. I would not take a date to see this \"date movie\" unless she was 12, but then I'd have bigger problems than this movie.\n\nThe good: I sadly must admit I enjoyed the cat using the toilet. At first it was stupid, but they stretched the scene way beyond the time necessary. Sometimes when you repeat a bad joke long enough it becomes great. For me, this was that moment. Also, this film featured two of my three favorite Buffy actors. Alyson Hannigan was beautiful and fun, and less obscene than in the \"American Pie\" movies. And Tom Lenk shows up in a cameo appearance as Frodo Baggins, a scene that makes no sense with the rest of the movie but I found to be juxtapositionally hilarious. If only this film also had Michelle Trachtenberg.\n\nThe ugly: The disgusting parts were actually much less than in the Scary Movie series. Other than pimple joke, I think the only really gross thing was the way this film portrayed fat people. A fat joke here or there I can understand, but they stretched the jokes to the limit with this movie and it was rather nauseating.\n\nDon't rent this movie. Although if you like the stupidity that passes for humor these days, this might be up your alley. Heck, I deplore this film and still confess I laughed out loud at least twice. But don't tell anyone I said that, because this movie is not good."

They could have made this into like 2 or 3 different movies and expanded. making it more original. But every scene was taken from something else. The scenes just made no sense when you watch them all as one movie, they even had movie spoofs of films that came out literally like 6 months ago. Some of the actors did not even seem to have any life to them, they were just there to be fillers. They should have taken more time to make this.To sum up this movie: sad, just a sad poorly done film."

What I got was this piece of crap that was a complete waste of an hour and a half and my 6.50. What's the problem? Oh where to begin...first of all, the plot is stupid. It's simple enough, I guess, but there's so many random things that just don't make sense (the random weird flashbacks during the Kill Bill sequence, for one). I don't know if it's just that the parody genre is being stretched so thin that there isn't anything left anymore, or if this movie was just bad writing. The acting isn't terrible, though some is cringe worthy. I think they tried so hard for going over the top that the jokes turn out disgusting, offensive, gratuitous, and just plain not funny. Nearly every sequence with \"Jinxers\", the Jones family cat, are horrid and disgusting. Nearly 98% of the jokes I had to tell my sister I would explain to her when she was older. And to complete it all, I was in a theater full of teenage boys, and not one of them laughed once, which goes to show how much the film falls on its face. The only time the audience gave a half-hearted chuckle was during the Mr. and Mrs. Smith sequence. So save yourself the time and money. Skip this absolute zero."

Sophie Monk and Carmen Electra are very sexy and give the necessary eroticism of the plot.

Why Alyson Hannigan decided to star in this movie is beyond me. Sophie Monk was the only decent actor and put on the American accent well in her first movie role (despite being cast as eye candy for the male audience). The remainder of the cast whilst possibly talented had so little to work with they would fire their agents if they ever see this trash. I saw this movie because it was free (like the rest of the cinema goers at this particular session). No one was laughing and I am sure I could hear tumbleweeds rolling through the cinema at various times. In all I counted about 4 scenes which made me laugh, I won't spoil them for you so that if you do happen to get dragged to this flick you will have some comic relief. My advice is to stay clear, well clear. Scary Movie 2 was better than this."

It started out stupid, and we hoped that it would get funnier as it went along. Well, for the next 45 minutes or so we sat through a big mix of annoying toilet humor, stupid cracks at ethnicity and fat people and sexual orientation, and, obviously, spoofs of recent romantic comedies. After all of that time, my friend looked over at me. I looked at him and knew we were thinking the same thing. He was the first to say it: \"Dude, this movie sucks.\"\n\nWell, I can tell that the makers of this movie were really trying to get something funny out of spoofing movies that WERE ALREADY FUNNY. Instead, they throw together some scenes that spoof those movies, add some nasty toilet humor and fat jokes, some sexual innuendo, some hot chicks, and some almost complete recreations of the scenes from movies they were spoofing and try to sell it off as funny. Well, sorry, filmmakers, but this isn't how you handle a movie. first of all, there is absolutely no attempt to connect these scenes by story. They just spoof a scene, move on, spoof a scene, move on, spoof a scene, move on... It is so annoyingly brain numbing (and have I mentioned not funny?) that after wards you will literally want to forget you ever saw it from the great pain it left in your head.\n\nUnless you are a fan of ridiculously dragged-out jokes, scene after scene of disgusting bodily function humor, bad acting (even from good actors like Alyson Hannigan), and comedy movies that aren't funny, don't see Date Movie. There are plenty of other more productive and entertaining things that you can do with your eighty minutes. Like staring at a wall."

It might have worked once, maybe twice, but the writers tried this on a continuous basis, and it became gross-overload.\n\nWe gave it about half-an hour, then gave up on it.

        "review_detailed_main": "When \"Airplane!\" came out in late 1980, it set the standard for the spoof movie, a motion picture that parodies a whole genre of others. In \"Airplane's\" case, it was the disaster film. It made fun of the Airport pictures, as well as \"The Posidon Adventure,\" \"Earthquake,\" and \"The High and the Mighty,\" among others.\n\nThis comedy was followed in quick succession by \"Spaceballs,\" \"Amazon Women on the Moon\" (which satirized sci-fi movies), the \"Naked Gun\" films, \"Spy Hard,\" \"Mafia\" and \"Repossessed\" (all with Leslie Nielson), \"Dracula: Dead and Loving It,\" \"Robin Hood: Men in Tights,\" \"National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon I\", and the 'Scary Movie\" series.\n\nMany of these had their own special charm, although none has lived up to the dumb-but-hilarious high mark set by Airplane! (although Nielson's \"Naked Gun\" trio, based on the short-lived 1982 TV show, \"Police Squad!,\" probably came the closest).\n\nThe newest effort, however, \"Date Movie\" (a send-up of all of those romantic stories we love to hate), attempts to do to those tales what Dick Cheney did to Harry Whittington's face, pepper it with shotgun pellets without hitting anything vital.\n\nMaking fun of such modern work as \"King Kong,\" \"When Harry Met Sally,\" \"Wedding Crashers,\" \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith,\" \"Kill Bill,\" \"Meet The Parents,\" \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin,\" \"The Wedding Planner,\" \"Bridget Jones's Diary,\" \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding,\" \"Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith,\" \"Hitch,\" \"Napoleon Dynamite,\" and a whole slew of the hip black comedies seemingly being released every week. All much better movies than this one satirizing them.\n\nAnd while the scattergun approach has worked before, the multiple targets aimed at by \"Date Movie\" remain unscathed and the audience, for the most part, remains unmoved (by laughter, anyway).\n\nI tried my best just to smirk at some of the \"jokes\" here, but I could not even force myself. I've actually been to funnier executions. This movie makes France's Reign Of Terror seem like an episode of \"Rocky & Bullwinkle.\" I've gotten bigger laughs with MY jokes, and my jokes stink.\n\nI think you get my point.\n\nThe plot (what there is of it) has one of the most untalented individuals ever to appear before a camera (including Al Gore), Adam Campbell as Grant Fonckyerdodder (get it?!), a nebbish idiot who is wooing Julia Jones (Alyson Hannigan, \"American Wedding,\" as well as a host of bad TV shows) and the supposed comic misadventures they go through meeting his folks, Jennifer and Fred (Jennifer Coolidge and Fred Willard, both veterans of the much funnier films, \"Waiting For Guffman,\" \"Best Of Show\" and \"A Mighty Wind\").\n\nGrant's beautiful ex-girlfriend, Andy (Sophie Monk), however, wants him back.\n\nOther embarrassed clowns passing themselves off as celebrities appear in this travesty, wondering around like doomed souls on the deck of the HMS Lusitania just before a German torpedo smashed into her cargo of illegal armaments. These include the poor man's Wayne Brady, Eddie Griffin (he played the pimp in the \"Deuce Bigalow\" pictures, so you get an idea of what I'm talking about), Carmen Electra, Michael Brooks, Matt Austin and Michael Jackson impersonator, Edward Moss and, oh, who cares?\n\nIt really doesn't matter one iota, anyway, you know.\n\nWith Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (\"Scary Movie\") sharing writing and directing chores (much like Loeb and Leopold shared in the killing of Bobby Franks \u0096 in fact, even Clarence Darrow wouldn't defend these directors), this will go down as nothing but a dull series of parodies that fails to parodize anything and does not even remotely approach the town of Humor.\n\nIt just stops at Tedium, spends about 90 minutes (although it seems much longer) and ends. To be fair, I guess seeing a cat on the toilet, King Kong groping Electra or Griffin as a midget pimp (is that the only character this goof-ball can play?!) might make one laugh. Probably the same people who sneak into locker rooms to sniff gym socks or those who voted for Al Sharpton, but not anyone else."

Anyways I have nothing more to say but I have to write some extra line so I write just for writing so if people want to stop reading that OK because really I just want to post my comment but I can't I think that stupid because I have nothing more to say."

        "review_detailed_main": "In the trailers and previews for this movie, they advertise \"From 2 of the 6 writers of Scary Movie\". They clearly could have used the other 4. Date Movie is a movie where once you get thinking about the concept, you realize there's no way it can actually work, mostly because it's trying to make fun of movies that were funny in the first place. The movie ended up being more clich\u00e9d than the movies was making fun of, recycling jokes like those of Lil Jon, Pimp My Ride, and the now-tired Napoleon Dynamite impressions. The movie references fall flat every time because they're presented so blatantly. While most parody movies may take a notable line and put a twist to it or in some cases copy the line, Date Movie's approach seems to be to rip out entire scenes from movies, add some lame punchline, and expect you to laugh like they thought of it all themselves and you haven't just seen a scene from a different film for the second time.\n\nWhen I saw/sat through the movie in the theater, sitting behind me were three girls who seemed to be talking the whole time. This was the first time I absolutely didn't care that people were talking through the movie, and what I also noticed was that they kept predicting what was going to happen, which usually turned out to be true. This speaks quite a bit for the film, which was so resiliently predictable.\n\nSo overall, this film was just really awful. No one over the age of 12 should find this very funny at all, and in the rare cases where they land a joke that's actually funny or clever, they keep pushing it until they've drawn every last bit of life from it. And of course, there is the glaring lack of any originality. To say only two people wrote this movie is giving an unfair share of credit. I think the writers for Meet the Parents/Fockers, Along Came Polly, etc. are owed some royalties."

        "review_detailed_main": "I heard of this movie several weeks before it came out, and I loved the idea. The writers of scary movie taking on another type of film. I personally liked the scary movies and other films like not another teen movie (even though it was downright bad is several spots). The weekend of the release i went around and read several reviews stating how awful this movie was. Still, my friends planned on going to see it, so i joined them. I walked into the movie theater thinking that this may be a piece of utter crap. Was it? Well, yes and no. Before i go on, let me say this. If you have any decently or wit, stop reading right now. I will tell you that not only will you absolutely hate this movie, but you will despise everyone whose in it and every person in the theater who even let a soft chuckle leave their mouth. But if you found the scary movies funny, or any other crude comedies, there might be a chance you will find a laugh or two in this not-so-witty comedy. Sitting in the theater, i noticed that most kids were about my age, and I am 16. And during the movie (myself included) i was laughing, believe it or not. There are no surprises, there is no wit, and there is no standards in this film. If seeing a cat hump a dead body then pull out a pack of condoms makes you want to puke, then by all means, stay away from this film. And yes, i too found this in bad taste, which may be why i was sitting in my chair squirming and giggling at the same time. My two friends who i were with were also laughing at this movie. Many of the jokes fall flat, and some are outright disturbing to the point where you might want to leave the theater just to save the few brain cells you might have left. If you like stupid comedy (such as two people on a date beating up a homeless man for no reason) this is a film you'll want to check into. If not, then take heed to the critic's advice and don't touch this movie with a ten-foot pole. Should you run out now and chuck out 8 hard earned bucks for it? No, absolutely not. This is the movie to go see on a lazy Saturday at the dollar theater if at all. So pick away at me if you want and call me an immature teenager, but i did laugh at this movie during several places.\n\nAnd on a side note, the movie can also be looked at as some sort of a game. The parodies come by so fast, that it is sometimes fun to lean over to the person you are sitting with and try and guess which scene came from what movie. Also, these scenes that the writer's parody are usually the famous and recognizable ones. So, wait until this movie hits a cheaper theater, and watch the much better scary movie series (exculding number 2)."

Making fun of fat people, beating a homeless person for a laugh, toilet humor.\n\nThe super smokin' bodies of SOPHIE MONK & CARMEN ELECTRA are the only redeeming highlights.

Now of course, my only reason for seeing the movie was that Alyson Hannigan was in it. I won't lie. But talk about wanting 1 1/2 hours of your life back. The movie barely had a plot, so it was just a bunch of unrelated, unfunny parodies, if you can call them that. I can take some crude humor, but this movie was just unnecessary. They really missed the mark in some scenes...someone should explain to them that a parody doesn't mean filming the SAME SCENE with different actors. There were a few snide remarks that made me chuckle, but everything about this movie made me remember why I don't like seeing the so-called mainstream movies. And the lead guy...not good looking. At all. If I'm going to be staring at some guy for 90 minutes, at least make it worth my while. So all in all, the jokes fall flat, and the movie really missed a chance to create something quite funny, since a parody of date movies, had it been done well, could have been hilarious. But this movie is far from that. You let me down, Alyson Hannigan. *Sigh* And another thing, it shouldn't be called Date Movie if it mocks every genre. Random Star Wars references and jokes about how advanced technology is stopped being funny...what, 5 years ago? I was hoping for something as on-the-mark as Not Another Teen Movie, but all I got was a big waste of time. Thank god it was free."

Well a typical compilation of spoofs for movies and TV shows such as Meet the parents/fockers, The wedding planner, pimp my ride, the bachelor, hitch and many more. All brought together by a ridiculous clich\u00e9 love story not to be taken seriously.\n\nTake in mind that a person with the brain of a Nat can watch this and still have a meaningful movie experience. There is a flaw in the overall flick though as it sometimes tries too hard with it's humor and drags itself into a boring scene. I recommend this for anyone with some free time and a cheap laugh. 7/10"

OK OK, they found a cute recipe when they threw out Scary Movie(the first one), but unfortunately as the films dragged on...Scary Movie 2, Scary Movie 3, Not Another Teen Movie, and the soon to be released Scary Movie 4 the jokes became repetitive, stretched, and in some cases just stupid. Date movie doesn't try any harder by stealing from already funny movies. The jokes/gags are dry and dull, the editing is horrible, and the soundtrack is...well it sucks too, what little there is! I probably shouldn't say this, because it'll confuse the types that would go to see this kind of movie, but hell I'll give credit where credit is due. I did laugh at some of the gags, but what was funny is painfully dragged out to be dry and almost embarrassing.\n\nWatch the trailer, that's all the funny you're gonna get from this movie.

I thought that it could be a bit crass, probably heavy on fat people / scato / sex / old people jokes. It was all that ... multiplied by a factor 100.\n\nAt the very least I thought I would have a few good laughs, which I did need like many other people after a tough week. On that I was disappointed. I cracked a smile on occasion, despite my better judgment. But not once did I openly laugh. Is that too much to ask for a comedy these days ?\n\nThe premisce of Date movie is not bad in and of itself, as making fun of the self-aware and sometime pretentious \"Romantic Comedies\" shouldn't be too difficult. So where did DM go wrong ? Pretty much everywhere.\n\nFirst, it seldom relies on the foundation of any movie, also known as a script. DM pushes the spoof concept so far that it does not have -any- decent narrative structure. It's like the script writers took their favorite moments in a dozen different comedies and patched them out together in one hell of a mess that some people might call \"a movie\".\n\nAmong the scenes copied, you will find Jinxer and the toilet flush from \"Meet the parents\", Jinxer and the Urn from \"Meet the parents\", The football match from \"Meet the Fockers\" (they did their best to remind people of famous Ben Stiller movies apparently) mixed with the basket ball scene from \"Along came Poly\" (in one of the few scenes that tore out a smile out of me), The Greek restaurant scene from \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\", The Diary from \"Bridget's Jones Diary\", The Black dad from \"Something about Mary\" (they indeed are big on Stiller), The scene about \"he lost his virginity with the Maid\" from \"Meet the Fockers\" but with a gay twist, The old lady from \"Not another teen movie\" (you know they are desperate when they try to spoof a movie that was already a spoof) etc ...\n\nIn that mess, they threw a bad copy of Napoleon Dynamite \"Gosh !\", a remake of the Paris Hilton Video, A scene from King Kong, a totally out of place jab at \"The Lord of the Rings\", and various other \"winks\" at the audience that make that mess feel even less coherent if it was at all possible.\n\nIt is not only bad that they try (pitifully) to make fun of actually funny comedies (like \"Wedding Crashers\") doing it so bad it becomes un-funny, on top of that they go as far as possible in Sleazy and disgusting to keep their PG-13, to be able to (or so they thought) please their male teenage audience.\n\nAt the end, we have a sorry mumbo jumbo of scenes, that I cannot in good conscience call a movie.\n\nActors are OK, with Mrs Hannigan being really good very often. Why she accepted to participate in this mess, we will probably never know ..."

The Michael Jackson thing was stupid. They already made fun of him in SM 3. I just think the whole movie was a rush job and the plot was put together in about three hours by a few high college kids who had no idea what they were doing. American Pie was much better, but still anybody who has anything to do with this movie has committed an unforgivable sin. The only reason I saw this movie was because there was nothing else except The Pink Panther, and god knows how that would have turned out. Anyway, never ever ever ever ever see this movie if you have a choice. If your girlfriend wants to see it, smack her and dump her. If your friend wants to see it, smack him in the face with a rusty pipe and tell him never to talk to you again. If your wife wants to see it, take off your ring and shove it down her throat.

Isn't it cool that we're parodying it? Do you get the reference? DO YOU GET IT?\" and continues on with it. There's not one thing I can remember I liked about this movie, and I wasn't the only one. Honestly I didn't go in expecting much - I was just with my friends, and they thought it would be really funny and I didn't feel like seeing something else by myself. When we left, none of my friends wanted to admit that they saw it, and my friends are idiots who love stupid humor.\n\nI'm not going to go over any of the specific details of the movie, a lot of other reviews have done that. But I'm just letting you, the reader, know that there is not ONE redeeming quality of this film. It is probably much worse than you're thinking right now."

The film was funny in moments, reflecting some other films quite carefully. In fact, although not totally spoofing My Best Friend's Wedding, The Bachelor, The Wedding Crashers, There's something about Mary, Meet the Parents, Hitch, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, and The Bachelor, this film almost replicates and parodies these films. It does so, with some good humor, some over the top moments, and no subtlety. But that doesn't make this a bad movie.\n\nThe two leads are good - and there are interesting moments. The film's fault is that it tries too hard to be funny and can become irritating in its frantic bid to have laughs at any cost.\n\nThat bing said, I do not think this is a bad film as such. There are worse."

If that was what was intended, DATE MOVIE fails on all counts. There isn't a single laugh to be had, and the movie feels like a bad high school play. A nebbish (Campbell) is courting a sweet young gal (Hannigan, who should know better). But his best-est friend is a fem,ale and a knockout (Monk) who also happens to be a former girlfriend. She intends to spoil their marriage plans and win him back. A slew of familiar faces play various parents, other relatives and friends. Eddie Griffin is along for the ride, and he is singularly unfunny in this. Somehow, I don't think it was his fault. Let me give you one instance of how this film fails at every turn: When Hannigan first meets her beau's best-est buddy, Monk is shown diving into a pool, coming up on the other side, showering off, then washing a car in her too-tiny bikini and even pole-dancing with the shower. This is all done in slow-mo and seems to go on on forever. Hanigan even comments on it. Through it all, we keep cutting back to Campbell and Hanigan for reacti0n shots, but they are all too obviously staring at the camera and not at Monk, who clearly filmed her sultry scenes separately. If this is supposed to be funny, it isn't. And when the three of them finally sit down together next to the pool, Monk whips off her tiny swimsuit and sits down nekked, except it just isn't funny or arousing or anything. You just want the damned sequence to end. Please pass this stinker by."

Yes, but not the world's worst film unless you really have no love for the art of stupidity. While many of the jokes are carbon copies of previous jokes in slapstick movies (not the first time, perhaps the worst time), there are a few truly hilarious, timely, even satirical and keenly observed tid bits beneath the cheap muck. I think what alienates most people from this movie is the overt nature of it's teen demographic (perhaps moreso then the scary movies), and the fact that it seemingly just stretches out it's parodies in an uninspired, exploitive manner..That may be true, but for some reason moments when they are simply mocking other comedy scenes by grossly overplaying them usually work at articulating why those original scenes were not really funny in the first place..I guess for me, having thought the majority of the scenes parodied we're originally pretty lame, was delighted to see them shat upon...Besides the parodies there are some decent performances and a few hysterical moments of morbid laughs if your dark humor cap is on tight (sometimes they cross the line, but usually they do not)...So there are some hit's among at least as many misses in this cheaply put together, but more cohesive then I was led to believe movie...If you are young (or at heart), and are in need of a frying pan to the head laugh, hopefully you will catch a few good ones with this flick."

FUNNY!!!! \"Date Movie\" was far from funny. It was just dumb. I was begging to laugh, I was seeking the least little crumb of humor to laugh at, but there was none. I honestly gave this movie a chance and it totally disappointed. In the end, I had to cut it off. I just could not watch it anymore. I made it 35 to 45 minutes into the movie before I cut it off.

Some of the scenes referencing other movies last maybe a .5 second. It's like they tried to cram as many movies into this thing as they could. Rather than going for quality they went for quantity, and some of the attempted spoofs are just downright stupid, and not in a funny way. None of the group that I watched it with enjoyed it. You'll find yourself watching a \"spoofed\" scene waiting for them to do something different from the original, and then when it comes to that point you'll find yourself like \"that's it? that's all they're changing about it?\".

This movie is so full of tired old setups with no laughs, and usually a gross out payoff. The 'hair gel' scene in \"Something About Mary\" is Shakespeare compared to the writers in \"Date Movie\", who are probably still in middle school. When lacking any other creative idea, the writers seem to fall back to the full-screen booty shot. There are a few laughs early on, but before half the movie is over, they are long gone. The writers seem to think we haven't seen this all before, and spend way too long setting up each punch line. HELLO, it's a parody of several other movies, we don't need long setups. The jokes should come fast and heavy, but the only thing heavy in this movie is Alyson's character in the beginning. Pathetic and very disappointing, this effort should be avoided at all costs, even in the Video store."

Ms. Hannigan is quite a talented actress and handles comedy and drama with equal deftness. In this film, as hard as she works (and she works pretty hard), she cannot save this bomb from destroying your will to go to the movies ever again. Take it from me, folks, the best parts of this movie are the scenes used in the previews.\n\nThis movie claims to be from 2 of the writers of Scary Movie, well I think they should have gotten the rest of the writers too; unless they were part of it and all but 2 bailed when they saw this ship sinking. Some of the highlights are: Jennifer Coolidge does a very accurate and funny Barbara Streisand, Tony Cox shows that he is the big man on campus when it comes to comedy, Meera Simhan is beautiful and funny, and Eddie Griffin was a trooper trying to put his best foot forward through a difficult situation. I got the feeling throughout the movie that Mr. Griffin was on auto pilot; not really acting or using his considerable talent but just coasting as if he knew the effort would be wasted.\n\nWait until the movie comes out on DVD and then get drunk before watching it because that is the only way it will ever be funny. A thorough waste of 83 minutes of my life I can never get back."

I mean I have been around a lot of fun suckers before but not this many. I thought it was funny. I love Alyson Hannigan and her work on American Pie and Buffy. I am a huge Buffy fan and a HUGE fan of Alyson's work.Sure I think they could have taken out that nasty hairball scene because I couldn't eat my popcorn after that. And maybe they should have spoofed only two movies instead of thirty. But not only 13 year old boys liked this movie because my parents went to see this with me and they were crying from laughter.So if you want to have fun I think that you should go see this movie and forget about all of these other comments."

That's not the worst thing about the movie though. With this kind of film, you really have to go down to the lowest form of intelligence you can ever be and fervently wish that the filmmakers had at least given you a justification of spending your money by an honestly funny script. It's one heck of a chore.\n\nJulia Jones (Alysson Hannigan) is an obese waiter at a Greek restaurant who meets his Prince Charming in Grant Funkyerdoder (Adam Campbell). She consults date doctor Hitch (Tony Cox), who transforms her into a proverbial swan. But before they can officially tie the knot, they have to go through a series of unfunny jokes that supposedly parody different scenes from \"Meet the Parents\" to \"My Best Friend's Wedding.\"\n\nThe characters are totally impossible to identify with although it would be unfair to pin down the blame to any of the actors, as the script just doesn't really stand out with most jokes falling flat. Not one laugh comes across as funny because the jokes are so simplistic. Besides, writers and directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (yes, \"two of the six\" writers of \"Scary Movie\") don't seem to have any grasp of the importance of timing in creating a comedy nor do they pace the film in such a way that makes it an effective parody of the genre it spoofs.\n\nIn the end, watching this film feels like you're trapped in a restaurant with some annoying loser who talks all evening thinking s/he's funny, and you wish you were at home instead, doing something - anything - else."

When Mel Brooks made a spoof movie, he usually made a funny one (the prime exception being \"Dracula: Dead and Loving It\") in part because he didn't inundate his movies with endless amounts of pop culture references. Instead, he actually put humor into his movie, not to mention actually telling one story that begins one place and ends in another.\n\nThese guys who made Date Movie obviously didn't know where to start and where to begin. I guess the movie's funny if you find it hilarious to identify which movies they are spoofing, as they have many obvious references to \"Bridget Jones' Diary\", \"Jerry MacGuire\", \"Meet The Parents\", \"Meet The Fockers\", \"My Best Friend's Wedding\", \"Wedding Crashers\", \"The Wedding Planner\", and most other movies that have the word Wedding in it. My problem with the movie was not that it was offensive or in bad taste. \"South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut\" was offensive, but it was funny. \"Borat\" was in very bad taste, but it was funny. This film was not funny, and I hated it probably more than I've ever hated any movie in my life.\n\nAll I can say is that after watching this movie and the atrocities that are unoriginally titled *(fill in the blank)* Movie, I just want to call the filmmakers up and just say, \"STOP! STOP MAKING STUPID MEANINGLESS UNFUNNY FILMS!\" Somehow this movie made enough money to merit a Scary Movie 5 and an Epic Movie, but no one I know likes these movies.

I loathed Disaster Movie, Epic Movie was pretty much the same and while not as bad as the former two Meet the Spartans was pretty poor too. While mostly very unfunny, Date Movie is the best of these spoof movies, mainly because there are one or two decent gags and the fact Alyson Hannigan's in it. The focus is on romantic comedy, and admittedly spotting the references to My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Meet the Parents and When Harry Met Sally is occasionally fun, the latter was one of the better gags as well as the stunt on the motorcycle, but the scenes where they featured in were in general very overplayed. Also there are some very cheap laughs, a scene involving a diarrhoea-afflicted cat hardly is going to spark any wit or imagination now is it? The plot line is on the lame and predictable side, and the direction is next to non-existent. The acting isn't as atrocious as it was in Disaster Movie, which was a perfect example of how NOT to act in a movie, but a majority of it was lifeless. I like Alyson Hannigan, I confess when I was 11 I was addicted to Buffy the Vampire Slayer and still am, and I think she was trying her best with superficial material. It is just that newcomer Adam Campbell is extremely unexciting as her new boyfriend, and Carmen Electra shows visibly here that she can't act. The remainder of the acting is unexceptional. All in all, it is not unbearably awful, but I doubt I would ever want to see this film again. 3/10 Bethany Cox"

In fact, I really think most teens wouldn't enjoy it...mostly just the stupid ones.\n\nThe film sends up films like \"When Harry Met Sally\", \"Hitch\", \"Meet the Parents\", \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" and a variety of other romantic films as well as the TV show \"The Bachelor\". A few of the jokes are funny...most are just gross and stupid. If you like fat jokes, folks beating up hobos and really, really crude jokes (such as about cats relieving themselves and anal sex references)...you'll like the movie.\n\nOverall, the film was about as bad as I expected....without any sort of redeeming value...unless you are REALLY drunk or extraordinarily stupid. And, I must admit that while I enjoy watching a dumb film from time to time, these sorts of things are pretty much impossible for me to enjoy or want to see twice...they're not just dumb but artless, brainless and will rot your mind."

I quite honestly expected to find \"Date Movie\" at least sporadically amusing, if not pretty good fun, but I found myself instead worrying about how many of my brain cells had been fried by watching this nonsense. It just wasn't funny. I turned off after half an hour. I just couldn't face the other sixty minutes or so - it was that BAD! Maybe the 450-odd IMDb reviewers who gave this film a \"10\" are rabid Alyson Hannigan fans, but believe me people, you'd be better off watching \"American Pie\" or stick to \"Buffy: The Vampire Slayer\". The poor girl tries her best, but the material just lets her down. I don't know why she agreed to sign on the dotted line for this pile of tripe. Maybe she just needed the money for food that month. She is so much better than this. I bet she wishes she could wipe this film from her C.V. I just wish I could wipe this film from my memory. Believe the hype. This is just about the worst movie ever made, and will surely be riding high at next years \"razzie\" awards. Don't see it. Please."

I like some romantic comedies but most of them are just a bunch of annoying clich\u00e9s so I was glad to hear about Date Movie. Unfortunately, the spoofs aren't creative at all. The film just recreates popular movie scenes without really adding anything special to them. A few of the jokes were funny while most of them were just stupid.\n\nThe blame should got to the writers who weren't trying very hard. Scary Movie did contain some lame material and it seemed like Date Movie copied all that lame material and put into one film. They made the most obvious spoofs without much creativity. I was hoping the preview wouldn't be an indication of what was to come but it portrayed the film perfectly so I can't same the advertising fooled me.\n\nThe acting was okay and there were a few funny performances. Alyson Hannigan was pretty pale and dull. She had a few funny lines but for the most part, her performance was pretty un-notable. Adam Campbell was okay, nothing special. Jennifer Coolidge was hilarious as Roz. She was defiantly the film's strongest point. Eddie Griffin was sadly underused and he didn't seem to be having a lot of fun either. The rest of the performances were all forgettable and they aren't worth mentioning. While Date Movie is a bust, it's also pretty harmless and it wasn't a complete waste of time. I really hate using that line but it's the best compliment I can give the film. In the end, the movie doesn't even warrant a rental, just skip it. Rating 3/10"

I will say that Alyson Hannigan certainly carried the movie quite well with her performance. And with the likes of Fred Willard, Jennifer Coolidge, Eddie Griffin and Tony Cox on the cast list as well, there are some familiar faces.\n\nThere are some good laughs here and there throughout the course of the 83 minutes that the movie runs for. However, directors Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg ultimately delivered a movie that just have contents to sustain a single viewing. There is little replay value to this 2006 spoof comedy.\n\nMy rating of \"Date Movie\" lands on a five out of ten stars."

Not so with \"Date Movie\". It's main purpose is to set up scenarios from certain movies just for the purpose of \u0085I'm not quite sure because humor certainly isn't the reason.\n\nOne problem with the film is that its core demographic, those who would enjoy lame scatological humor, are teens and a number of the films spoofed are before their time. During one scene in which the orgasm scene from \"When Harry Met Sally\" was mimicked, the audience I attended the screening with had no idea what film they were doing a take of.\n\nThere is not one redeeming thing about this film. It is unfortunate that Alyson Hannigan chose this script as her first top-lining film. Also, Eddie Griffin, showing that Heidi Fleiss isn't the only prostitute in Hollywood, once again shortchanges himself by being in an excruciatingly, achingly bad film."

I find it very difficult to write a review on a movie that is as bad as this and make it 10 lines long. But since that is the requirements of this fine community known as the internet movie database i will do this. I could have written a better movie using my anus to hold the pen for the script. It is too bad that a girl such as Alyson Hannigan participated in this vomit bucket. She doesn't really show it but she does have talent to act in quirky roles. She is not going to win an academy award but she can do far better than this heaped together junk. If a movie has Eddie Griffin it is probably a wise decision to stay a distance from it."

I knew going into this that it was going to be stupid, but stupid humor can be great if it's done well. Almost every single joke in this movie fell flat. I chuckled a couple times, but other than that, nothing was funny AT ALL. I guess that some of the writers from Scary Movie worked on this. Scary Movie is FAR SUPERIOR and is one of the funniest spoofs I've ever seen. This movie is garbage. I thought Alyson Hannigan was funny in previous movies, but she had nothing to work with here. All the jokes were tired. Most of the theater (about 3/4 full) were not laughing as well. If popping huge zits, cats taking a poop in a toilet, and loud obnoxious farting are your thing, than you may like this. I think possibly teenagers would enjoy this movie, but even they may think it's stupid. The scenes from the romantic comedies they spoof are not even the funny scenes from those movies. I don't understand how somebody would make this and think it is good.\n\nI found out right before going into the theater that this was a PG-13 movie, and my expectations fell right there. If you are going to do a good parody, in my opinion, an R rating is needed. I think the R rating helped make Scary Movie so good.\n\nI gave this movie 2/10 only because Jennifer Coolidge is in it, and it's sad because she's a riot in EVERY OTHER MOVIE I've seen her.

There are porn movies that are better written. I mean the cheap ones they sell in quick marts.\n\nAfter seeing this movie I felt like suing the studio to get my money back. Short of that I'll have to use a power drill to get the memory of it out of my head. Thats how bad this movie is."

They both looked rather lame, but I thought that \"Date Movie\" might at least be funny. And for the first time in my life I walked out of the movie theater before it was even over. I tried to sit through the entire movie, not wanting my money to go to waste, but about an hour in I realized that my money was already wasted, so I might as well not waste another 30 minutes of my life sitting here. The gags were unoriginal and unfunny. A character unknowingly hitting and knocking someone over was funny maybe the first few times it was ever used in a movie. But it's not anymore. Stop it. None of the humor was clever, it was basically just being as gross as possible within the boundaries of a PG-13 movie and passing it off as funny. Matt Stone and Trey Parker manage to effectively use gross out comedy, because there is a passiveness to it. When the characters have a more subtle reaction to the vulgarity of the action at hand it just works as funny. But when people use it, like the people in this movie, where the characters have huge reactions, it just comes off as trying way way to hard to be funny. I hated the movie, but at least my popcorn was nice and buttery. I give my popcorn 8.5 out of 10 and this movie 1 out of ten. I'd give the movie less if I could."

The Meet the Parents/Fockers spoof was the funniest part of the film, and it really was not very funny. It is one of the most repetitive films ever and has disgusting sex jokes including a cat pulling out condoms getting ready to have sex with a dead grandma or gross jokes like Julia popping her pimple or Frank (Julia's father) getting a man's stumoch hair in his mouth and throwing up a hairball. It's absolutely disgusting and it has no plot. It's a bunch of 3 minute gags all thrown together with the same characters. The gags that could be slightly amusing are pulled out too long, like the Kill Bill gag. And they somehow fit a King Kong parody in here, which had to be the stupidest part of the film. I was totally disgusted in this movie, but in all honsety I've seen worse.\n\nMy rating: F. 71 mins. PG-13 for disgusting sex and poopoo jokes."

You can't really make a movie thats making fun of other movies and have a total strong plot line. It had great funny moments, but the lead actor didn't really pull off his part. The Willow girl did pretty good in this film though. This is just a straight up laugh your a** off movie.I'm not one to like comedies because I don't find most of them very funny, but I did like this one.

Apparently this movie was written by two of the six writers of scary movie. I highly doubt that as this movie was nothing like scary movie. The two writers that wrote this were probably the ones who had their ideas rejected because they're just not funny. The only part I remotely like is when the man made the description of killing his wife. You'll know what I mean if you see it. The opening was OK. But the whole thing SUCKED!

At one point our lead walks into a redundant spoof of \"What Women Want\", where she can hear everyone's thoughts. And she goes \"It's like I'm in a bad Mel Gibson movie\". That's creativity right there. And speaking of shivers down my spine, what's with the huge gross-out factor in this movie? There are snuff movies less disgusting than this one. I guess gross-out can be funny somehow someway, but I really didn't need constant close-ups of moles, back hair, liposuction fat and Sophie Monk. Disturbing stuff. And I guess I should feel sad for everyone involved, but why must Alyson Hannigan do this to me? I guess it's a paycheck, but I would really hate to see the screenplays she rejects, if any.

I went into the theater expecting something hilarious, and mind numbingly funny, I got something really disappointing. The acting was not at all at fault, the writing and half witted spoofing is. Like the run on series Scary Movies this just fails to make you want more. It's strikingly similar to Not Another Teen Movie, but cheesier jokes, dumber humor, and there was nothing clever about it. I would recommend even if you really want to see this movie, wait until it hits DVD, even if your desperate.

This movie took funny jokes from good movies such as Meet the parents and turned them into awful jokes that were done in extremely bad taste. The best way to describe it is that the crude and disgusting humor in this movie was way over the top. I went with some friends to go see it and it was my suggestion to go.

The scary movies use one movie for the basic plot, and then use a few other movies for basic jokes. The date movie has its own plot line, and uses too many movies to get jokes. It makes it seem as if they were desperate to make a funny movie, so they had to stick all these other movies to try and make it funny.

Yes its plot is extremely thin, yes it is nothing but a bunch of rather poorly done parodies of the more successful films over the last 20 years. But what I think you fail to understand is that is the point. It isn't supposed to be a cleverly made Oscar winning masterpiece, it is purely designed to give a few laughs. Now some of the scenes to be sure are more disgusting than funny (hairball), but many of the scenes do indeed have a lot of humour in them. The audience I attended the movie with laughed fairly constantly throughout and no wonder.\n\nI think it all comes down to a matter of taste in the end. Date Movie, like its predecessors of the Scary and Teen persona, follows the basic plot line of the genre it is spoofing very loosely, but with enough innovation to be enjoyable and the spoofs are in fact quite cleverly conceived. They aren't hilarious skits such as you would find in Flying High, but they are amusing enough and while it certainly helps to have seen the movies spoofed, most of the jokes are obvious enough to work on their own.\n\nIn short, the film is funny as long as you don't go into it with high expectations. Not as good as its predecessors, but it still works. I won't be buying the DVD, but I'll be sure to watch it on TV one day. After all, it is in the end a cheap laugh and a good way to wind down of the evening."

If I had to point out one thing that was not absolutely horrible, it would have to be Eddie Griffin; he's not really funny in this, but he does have the potential to be funny and have liked him in other films.\n\nAs for Allison Hannigan, is this really the only place she has to go after the American Pie movies. She wasn't bad in them. Too bad she can't get better parts.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: Pure trash."

It was so awful because it was poorly constructed and written, it took no talent to take parts from other movies and changed it ever so slightly to make it 'funny'. It would have been funny to the writers when they've gone out and gotten drunk, which is probably how they went about to get this piece of rubbish written.\n\nWe've all gotten drunk and discussed how to make something funny, however we wouldn't make a movie out of it.\n\nThe only thing that was good about the movie was it's cast. They chose the best actors to suit the job and that's the best they could do.\n\nGod help them if they chose a different cast that did a poor job on the movie.\n\nThe humour was very immature, admittedly I like immature humour but they did a ghastly job on that too.\n\nThis movie suits a person with a simple sense of humour such as a 12 year old or someone who prefers a different genre of movie who seeks out for a funny movie.\n\nIronically this movie is rated for over 15 years old and even people with simple tastes cannot bear this movie.\n\nSo I'll warn you now not to go and see this movie at the cinema, I suggest getting it at a very cheap cost such as rental or digging it out at your local video shops bargain bin."

It was just a conglomeration of poorly written references to other, mostly crap, movies. I knew we were in trouble when the first movie that was paid homage was Napoleon Dynamite. From there on out, it just got sick, twisted, and fully worthy of a -8 or -9 stars out of 10. The Scary movie serials weren't this bad, and they at least made some attempt to create an original plot. All that occurred here were some familiar scenes from well known movies acted out word for word. So be it, they were modified in execution to make them more crass and disgusting, but there was no significant variance on the originals. It was good in one way, FOR ME TO POOP ON!"

Actually many of us were trying to guess what some of the scenes were from and when the movie was over said we were going to see it again. From the opening scene to the end you will be entertained. I would suggested seeing it with friends though because that always makes it even more fun because you always seem to have more fun and enjoy a movie more when you are with friends. Alyson Hanigan is brilliant as well as the new comers in this movie. I recommend it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Some spoilers ahead.\n\nThis movie does justice to humanity by mocking and spoofing the genre of romantic movies (I hesitate to call these tedious, sappy love stories \"romantic comedies\", as there's very little about them that is funny). It, like its successor films, \"Epic Movie\" and \"Meet the Spartans\", is not very deft at spoofing specific films, and some of the parodies fall flat. This movie does succeed because it has competent, enthusiastic actors, and a coherent plot that includes the basics of what a romantic movie should have: conflict, a plucky lovelorn heroine, and a happy resolution, with all loose ends tied up. Allison Hannigan, of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" fame, is absolutely endearing, charming, and hilarious as the embattled protagonist, Julia. Adam Campbell, Sophie Monk, Eddie Griffin, and Jennifer Coolidge do their utmost to make this farce a success. It is because of them that this movie stays afloat, whereas lesser comedians would have tanked this film. Their talents, as well as their understanding that this is a farce that requires to be over-the-top, make this the most watchable romantic \"comedy\" ever.\n\nIn spite of the superb acting in this movie, there are many gags that are awful. The \"Harry Met Sally\" gag is just too overlong and not funny in the least. Some of the \"Meet the Parent\" gags don't work. Ironically, it is the original story within the movie, rather than the parodies of any specific movie, that are the funniest parts of the movie. They balance out the poorly-written parody gags and somehow keep this comedy afloat. I recommend \"Date Movie\", especially to those who hate romantic movies or those who appreciate fine comedic acting in the same vein as a Mel Brooks or Zucker and Abrams film. \"Epic Movie\" and \"Meet the Spartans\" are improvement, but \"Date Movie\" is still funny enough not to pass up."

Think of half-funny scenes from other movies, poorly re-enacted, all pieced together with ginger minger Alison Hannigan and the result is Date Movie.\n\nI rented this and watched it with my bro. From the very beginning I kept thinking \"this isn't funny... this isn't funny\", but wholeheartedly expected it to pick up. It didn't. And after about 40 minutes of lame jokes I just couldn't take anymore and switched it off.\n\nI met my friend the next day and said \"I just watched the worst movie ever\"... and he instantly asked if it was \"Date movie\"...\n\nSince then if I'm ever in a video store I always put other movies in front of the date movie box so other people don't make the same mistake and rent possibly the worst movie ever.\n\nInteresting side-note, my sister went to Epic Movie when it was released in the cinema and said it was the worst movie ever. I'd love to see which is actually the worst movie ever, but I just couldn't bring myself to watch Epic Movie knowing it was made by the same losers who made Date Movie."

And of course the ultimate question: what is most boring, watching this movie or watching paint dry? Actually i guess pain might make some nice patterns or something while drying so...\n\nThe truth here is that there are so many talentless people involved in this project. The two directors (also script-writers) Friedberg/Seltzer are responsible for the scripts to some real crap so i didn't expect much. But still the Scary Movie-franchise, boring as it may be, is still a lot better than this crap. This movie displays a complete ignorance as to what makes comedy work. Inane spoofs are mixed with plump jokes about fat people, sex and feces. Comedy on a low level can work but it needs to be done with a lot more style than here.\n\nBad comedy is almost painful to watch, and this movie hurt. And when it didn't hurt it just produced a huge yawn. I'm still surprised that movies like this one actually get made and paid for by someone."

She/he asks you to organise the first date. \"A meal and the cinema?\", you offer. \"Sure, what film?\", they reply. You look at the availability of films. Date Movie appears. \"What could possibly go wrong?\". Five minutes in, after eating your luxurious McChicken sandwich meal at McDonalds (because you're cheap), you vomit it back up after watching Hannigan in a fat suit shake water off her body like a beached whale. \"This, was a bad idea!\". Suffice to say, you did not obtain that elusive second date, and thankfully this parody-fuelled nightmare did not receive a sequel.\n\nSpoofs can be funny when intelligently incorporated into a story that do not rely on profanity and obtuse humour. The first 'Scary Movie' for example, took the genre it was parodying and intellectually flipped it to mock the traits it commonly utilises. Date Movie, well, isn't that. It's a game. A game of \"how many films can you shout out before your opponent?\". There's atleast thirty points up for grabs here. From romantic comedies ('Bridget Jones Diary', 'Shallow Hal' etc.) to random popular blockbusters ('King Kong', Kill Bill' etc.). The 'Meet The Parents' and 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' parodies act as the central narrative, with a plethora of random sketches embedded throughout. Problem is, they're aren't funny. At all.\n\nA cat licking the tongue of a corpse from an urn? Popping a gargantuan spot in front of a mirror? Undergoing a miraculous makeover, 'Pimp My Ride' style, involving waxing the hairiest back possible and clipping odorous toe nails? Stop it! Cheap sketches in a bid to make younger audiences laugh, but if anything, forces them to turn away and belch. Some scenes didn't even make any sense whatsoever! The 'Step Up' dance sequence with 'Hitch'? I...I don't get it.\n\nBoth applause and hisses must be given to the cast. Each of them, Hannigan in particular, hold no reservations and go full throttle. But why? Why subject yourselves to this monstrosity? Were your careers really that stale that you had to re-enact the 'When Harry Met Sally' orgasm scene? Jennifer Lopez is parodied in this, as is Michael Jackson. No idea why, they just are.\n\nAt this point in time, nothing makes sense. Hilarity is non-existent. Vulgarity is everything. And if you hadn't atleast exclaimed \"ewww!\" before that basketball scene with the homemade waxing method, then you certainly are a more ferocious warrior than myself. Date Movie is a stain on Hollywood that, unsurprisingly, made room for more pointless endeavours..."

Make a comedy out of a comedy--that's what it amounts to, that these talentless hacks were doing, er, trying to do, that is. They failed. In every way imaginable.

Scary Movie 2, 3, and 4 got progressively got weaker. But \"Date Movie\" was the final nail in the coffin for \"spoof\" movies as far as I'm concerned. And Hollywood isn't through yet! Ooooooh no. Now there is \"Epic Movie\" to rob naive viewers of their money. I, for one, am not watching that one unless I don't have to pay money for it. And thats not all! We have Scary Movie 5 to look forward to in 2008! Wonderful! Hollywood is dead.\n\nDate Movie is very very clich\u00e9d, with your typical useless Hollywood references, disgusting humor (not the funny kind), drawn-out jokes beaten-to-death-thus-rendering-them-useless, and predictability comparable to the fact that the sun is going to rise tomorrow (in most parts of the world, at least).

        "review_detailed_main": "Right from the opening scene in which the main character (Alyson Hannigan in a fat suit) is seen dancing seductively to 'milkshake' in the street whilst horrified onlookers cringe, run past her to dance with camp, gay men, or for some reason spray her with water, you know what kind of film your in for. Crude, ridiculous and so unfunny that you'll feel like walking out every 5 minutes until the film is finally over and you're put out of your misery.\n\nAfter the novelty of the fat suit is milked for everything its worth, the writers decide they need some eye candy to stop the boys tuning out, which is solved by a ludicrous \"pimp her out\" section where stereotypical black mechanics \"pimp\" Julia, and, voila! One rap song and a tool box later and Julia is a sizzling sexpot ready to embark on a journey of finding true love, on a game show where the bachelor is told to \"shoot the girls you don't want to bang\".\n\nThe bachelor, Grant, and Julia then soon fall in love after a date of beating up homeless people, and become engaged which is complicated by Grants best \"man\" Andie- a conniving blonde bimbo out to steal Grant back.\n\nWhilst films of a similar vein, such as Scary movie, are well observed and actually funny, Date Movie takes the concept too far. It is TOO gross, TOO unrealistic and tries far TOO hard. The writers of this drivel, who happen to be two of the writers of scary movie (apparently the worst ones) fail to realise that the genre of romantic comedy spoofs has been done. The under-rated \"not another teen movie\" is a witty film which exposes Date Movie as utter, un thought-out tripe.\n\nOne of the many bad bits of the film is a scene in which a constipated cat is sat on the toilet for two long minutes, with accompanying facial expressions and repulsive sound effects. This may fare well with people aged 11-13 with an immature sense of humour, but its likely most people will sit in stunned silence throughout this entire saga.\n\nIn fact, said cat is likely to become an icon for the younger, less intelligent teenagers in the audience. After his toilet troubles he also rapes a skeleton and has sex with an old lady. Think I'm lying? Unfortunately I'm not.\n\nRemotely intelligent viewers may also wonder why Caucasian Julia has an African American dad, an Indian mum and a Japanese sister. Well the answer is simple. It invites racist jokes and is used as a window for unimaginative character stereotyping.\n\nA parody of \"Hitch\" is also a low point. A midget love doctor named Hitch helps Julia with her dating techniques by flossing a chicken wing out of her teeth. I was expecting the writers to rename him \"Titch\" but perhaps that kind of joke was too sophisticated for them.\n\nA parody of The Wedding Planner starring a Latina named Jell-O, with a cushion shoved down her trousers, also misses the mark and is yet another cheap ploy for laughs. Cue the tumbleweed.\n\nThe acting in Date Movie is also well below par. Julia is far too whiny whilst Grant's accent starts to grind after the first few minutes. But does it really matter when the actors look the part? The casting directors seem to think not, yet evidently, yes, it does.\n\nOf course, tired Michael Jackson jokes where he moon dances and tries to seduce a young boy are featured too, which should please the youngsters who have read Michael Jackson's exploits in The Sun, but many will simply roll their eyes at something which is overdone and usually more effectively done.\n\nMale viewers may be momentarily entertained by the three minute scene where Andie- a Paris Hilton clone- dances around in a bikini, washes a car and eats a banana, simply to drum into the audience that she is Julia's love rival and is conventionally sexier, but Date Movie is generally not at all entertaining.\n\nOf course there will be exceptions. I'm sure young teenagers seeking non-intelligent films full of fart jokes will lap Date Movie up, but chances are everyone else will leave the cinemas bored, disgusted and wanting a refund.\n\nTo sum up, the best thing about Date Movie is that it only lasts 83 minutes, the worst thing is everything else.\n\nTo those of you considering going to see date Movie, one word of advice; DON'T."

I had my dignity and walked out at the 30 minute mark. They had it so hyped up, and I actually thought this was going to do it, this was going to be a movie that was funny, and it made fun of others, like the original scary movie. No wonder this movie sucked so bad, it was from \"2 of the 6 writers of scary movie\". I would be very glad to be one of the other four right now that declined to put their name in this god-forsaken travesty. Scary Movie 1 and 2 were good, but as soon as they tried to change everything to \"Naked Gun\" style comedy with scary movie 3 and this one, it all just went to hell. I did quite enjoy one part though, but I had already seen that in the preview, so it wasn't new to me, yet funny."

After viewing this movie, myself and others walked out looking half dazed, half wanting to vomit in our wallets for ever taking the money out to invest in such a ticket. From the beginning to the end, this movie was shocking. I'll give it to the directors for being so spot on with the\n\nparodies, but after at least 50 references to movies of the past 5 years, it gets older then the stench of pure hate in the theatre. The first few minutes show a spoof of Napolean Dynamite. How dare they. That was when I realized that it was indeed a waste. The minutes that followed involved crude humour, revolting antics, and was very very unfunny. The funniest bit was Grant imitating Mr and Mrs Smith and talking about smothering Julia. The rest was complete and utter crap. The ending was not expected. Just kidding. The plot outline had nothing but gooey love crap behind it, and maybe some hair balls and penis references. Michael Jackson spoofs were quite funny, simply because he was in the background, whilst the nauseating \"actors\" were int he foreground. Sophie Monk, that hideous bucked tooth woman, took up about a good 40 minutes of this movie. Not only can she not act, but she also can't sing, dance, or look good. Her part in the movie didn't so much as make it better, it made it dreadful. Too much Sophie Monk makes any person want to be propelled into a brick wall. Fair enough she's Australian, but also fair enough she is scamming into any movie she can get her hands onto. If you like seeing movies, don't be swayed to see this one. This is not a movie. This is some retarded puzzle that no one quite can fit together. Not all it's cracked up to be. The ad's lie. Your friends lie. I don't."

I was rather disappointed when I sat in the theater and considered trying to get my money back. The movie is decent, however, it is not nearly worth the seven dollars to see it. I recommend watching this movie when it comes to television. Also, this movie is filled with adult sexual-related context and was surprising to see so many younger patrons there not understanding the sexual content. The actors were not too bad, however, the script really was just an attempt to gain cheap laughs and spoof classic movies. It was a disappointment to see this movie, in my opinion."

Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer should look to seek refuge in Libya or somewhere - especially when the Razzies come around - i'm sure they'll have a clean sweep.\n\nThere was a 'possibility' for this film to do well, as it had all the ingredients for a successful spoof - the ingredients being 'other films'. But Friedberg managed to make a total cock-up of something a kid in school could have done a better job with - he lacks that knowledge that the Wayans brothers (or anybody's brothers) have.\n\nPlease save your money, and reduce the amount of money this film brings in. I had no choice but to watch it as I had seen everything else which was showing; but if you can watch 'anything' else, please do so - otherwise, leave all sharp objects at home, and, jokes aside: certainly leave any semi-suicidal people at home, we don't want a bloodbath."

She meets a young man (Adam Campbell) where they fall in love filled with gags that make you close your eyes and want to puke instead of laughing.

I honestly believe that the best parts of the movie were for one, the previews, and two, the 10 second period of having my eyes closed out of sheer disgust. I highly suggest that anyone thinking of seeing this movie should first be warned that those few moments between scenes when nothing is going on will be the best parts. Yes, i did laugh, but the reason i laughed the few times i did was because some parts were mildly funny but they were so overpowered by the sheer badness of the movie that I believe that i actually cried, and thats not a joke. Movies like this just make me wonder how such HORRIBLE movies can make fun of some decent movies. Its actually funny, that i like almost every movie that i have ever seen, except this one. I walked away from the theater terrified and wondering if I will ever be back. I lost all respect for all actors in that movie, most of whom i liked before. It just goes to show that whenever you put Carmen Electra and Lil John in a movie, the result is pure trash. I highly suggest to anyone even thinking about going to see this, first boar out your eyes with a pencil to make the movie more enjoyable."

'thank god thats over'. please don't put yourself through it. it is that awful. i wanted to leave halfway through but i didn't want to leave my GF, she liked it slightly. believe me, this is the worst movie ever made. trust me"

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay, look. Clearly a lot of people really dislike this movie. In fact, I really enjoyed reading the bad reviews, i've never seen a movie so conclusively and consistently panned before.\n\nThe reviews were so uniform I almost didn't watch the movie. But what the hell, I just HAD to see for myself. Could it REALLY be THAT bad? Well... no. Actually, not only was it NOT as awful as people were saying, I really rather enjoyed it. It certainly wasn't an instant classic or a literary masterpiece, but what spoof is? This made me think... how come I enjoyed it when so many people seemed to hate it? It almost suggests that either I'm utterly weird (I don't really think I am), incredibly childish (um.. no... not that I know of) or the people who write reviews on IMDb are cut from similar cloth.\n\nIn fact, the movie really IS quite funny, as long as you enjoy this sort of comedy. The person who compared it to Kung Pow was on the mark, I think. If you liked Kung Pow's humour, you'll probably like this. But I don't agree that it was anywhere near as sick as most people painted it. Some of the American Pie stuff was as gross as this, and don't even get me started on \"Freddie Got Fingered\" or \"Something About Mary.\" This is no worse than the nasty bits in those, so if you can get behind this sort of humour you won't come out morally outraged.\n\nThe comments about it \"having no plot\" and the parodies seeming \"pointless and too sudden\" are, in my opinion, absolute nonsense. It's a very silly movie, don't get me wrong, but it WANTS to be a silly movie. It was made for people who like silly movies. It's the perfect counterbalance to the bloated full-of-their-own-importance movies of the moment.\n\nAs for the \"awful degradation\" of the homeless, the fat, midgets etc etc etc.... I can't help but think the people who write these reviews aren't anywhere near as smart as they like to think they are. This is a SPOOF. All the things that this movie takes shots at come from *other* movies, or TV shows, or whatever. This is just putting a light on things that are done elsewhere. That's what a parody DOES.\n\nLots of people complained that the movie Parodies good movies they enjoyed like \"Meet The Parents\". Sure, it does. But a parody isn't an insult. A parody is a poke of fun which carries with it some respect for the original, or at least an appreciation that the film is worth a parody. I can't understand the comments that \"it just repeats the scene and adds nothing\". That's completely wrong. Take the scene where the Vase is hit thats from Meet The Parents. That's not a copy. Something is definitely added, and I thought it was pretty clever and very funny. All the clips from other movies were well done and amusing.\n\nIf you are a fully-paid card-carrying member of the politically-correct brigade you will hate, hate, hate this movie. And you will try to run down anybody who doesn't agree with you.\n\nThe main problem with this movie is that its a little TOO clever and subtle to reach some of its audience, but its way too puerile to satisfy the intellectuals. Oh and the liberal crusaders are going to hate every second of it. So, whose gonna like it? Well... all those people in the middle, I guess. And me, for sure."

People would ask me why...and I would find myself speechless, without any memory of reason.\n\nThat is, until, I got a free pass to go see DATE MOVIE (yeah...free and I still felt robbed...robbed of an hour and forty-minutes or so I could've spent sitting on my couch watching \"REN and STIMPY\" cartoons I got the night before).\n\nMy first question was this: how can a comedy spoof other comedies? It's unheard of and useless. I guess, in this case, all you do is take material and scenes from those films and mash them into a loaf, making once entertaining sequences and quotes a bleak excuse to waste a few hundred million on placing a roll on a reel.\n\nHey...It's not the cast's fault. Alyson Hannigan, as cute as she is talented, does what she can with the script that was thrown at her. It is nice to see her back on the screen, because I kind of dislike CBS's boring sitcom, HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER (trust me, she's the light on that otherwise dark, dreary Monday night time slot). Tim Meadows, a fine comic actor, seems to be out of work these days. Sure, we all loved him in LADIES MAN, and I was taken by surprise when he showed up in MEAN GIRLS (shut up...I liked that one, too). Hee hee...TV legend Fred Willard shows up a bit. Sadly, it's a far cry from his amazing performance in ANCHOR MAN and ends up just being a pitiful desperation to star in more movies. All else...none of the other cast members are worth mentioning. In fact, the whole movie in general isn't worth mentioning. The only thing I enjoyed here was Carmen Electra's nice cameo (it was ruined, however, by a KING KONG parody and a sex-crazed 12 year old native boy snapping pictures with his cell phone camera. The nerve).\n\nI don't want to offend, but when I sat through what they claimed was a motion picture, I began to envy the seeing and hearing impaired, praying to God to have both placed upon me until the film's rolling credits were either starting or gone all together. Truly...I was that depressed by it.\n\nNot laughing a single time reminded me of watching episodes of WHO'S LINE IS IT ANYWAY? or THE NANNY...hell, especially GIRLFRIENDS.\n\nHollywood seems to let it all happen: Scientology, Hugh Grant's blowjob, gay cowboys, and DATE MOVIE. Nothing works anymore. It's as dry as a hillbilly's shower curtain. I used to want to fight for the return of Hollywood's Golden Age...but right now I ask: is it worth it?\n\nFace it folks, DATE MOVIE is proof that filmmakers will make anything and viewers will view anything. Which one is the dumber of the two is a decision I'll let you, the nice reader, figure out after the big summer blockbuster run. Enjoy what little you can."

The humor lacks any and all subtlety, making it great for the viewer who doesn't want to have to think about a joke and just wants to laugh at how fat someone is or that a cat is taking a crap. The majority age range in the theater seemed to be something like 13-15 at the most, so I knew from the start I was in trouble. It falls well short of the solid parodies in Scary Movie, quickly showing you why only 2 of the 6 writers got involved with Date movie. Save your money on this one, I wish I had."

Hannigan, Willard and Coolidge were all abused in the making of this movie, in my mind. It is hard to believe the \"writers\" (in quotations because I don't think they wrote much here) have a respect for Hannigan as presumably indicated by the fact that they went to her saying they wrote this movie for her.

The entire movie is only a pathetic trial to copy and fuse many of the most famous romantic/comic/action blockbusters of the last years. Indeed the people with a few neurons into the brain could think that this movie is a masterpiece of the comic genre. But the sane people surely will accord to me with the fact that if anyone want to see a real romantic/comic/action movie can rent it and stop. And not spend the money to see a pathetic mix of movies that contains only scenes that could stink a pig. Only positive note for this movie : if you are a fan of Sophie Monk you will be happy ;)"

If your like me and enjoy spoofs and films such as scary movie then this film is for. You have to be opened minded when watching this film and appreciate the efforts gone into the humour. The directors included many films that they mocked such as Meet the Fockers and Hitch which was very amusing. All I can say is that is this is a light hearted film with loads of humour that can make you laugh every time you watch it."

That's not the case of Date Movie. In this entire movie there was not a single moment that I found funny. The spoofs are ridiculous, the gags are stupid and the acting... well, the acting just isn't there. There is no storyline, the movie just goes jumping from one spoof to another, and there isn't anything worthwhile.\n\nEvery bad movie has it's fans, which proves the subjectivity of the movie industry. But this is not the case with Date Movie. I don't think that one single person has enjoyed this movie, not even the actors that star in it. I just can't understand why would a movie studio spend a single cent in this. And i'm sorry that I spent money in renting it.\n\nDon't spend time watching this. Sitting alone in a room looking at the walls will be more interesting and more funny than watching Date Movie. If you already seen it, well, then i'm sorry you wasted an hour and a half of your life with it, as I did.\n\nBy far the worst movie ever, in all aspects."

Instead you have a movie that was written by people who lack any sense of humor. A woman washing a car is sexy, but when you make her rub herself during that scene with hamburgers, it's not sexy. Nor is it hilarious, funny, or even mildly amusing. You end up wondering why someone would really think this is funny, or that they wasted a perfectly good hamburger to make this garbage pile of movie.\n\nIf your faced with a choice between this movie and swallowing 23,000 cyanide pills, suicide is your only option."

There wasn't a single original thought in the film. The point of a parody is to take a scene from another movie and add a satirical element to it that generates humor. This movie seems to be content in just shoving in scenes from other movies, without any humorous elements added. For example they were in the middle of a Kill Bill parody scene when they cut to a flashback sequence of alyson hannigan in bed getting hit by a character from dodgeball, then back to the kill bill parody which in itself ended up being pretty poor. In the end, all the parodies were less than funny. Nothing like the fun \"Not Another Teen Movie\" and the \"Scary Movie\" franchises. Alyson Hannigan did alright i guess, but everyone else involved, even the brilliant Fred Willard should try to forget they ever did this movie.\n\nSummation: I feel dumber after watching this film. One of the worst movies ever. Negative 1 stars out of 100"

Still I cannot believe the amount of you criticize refusals towards the film, and is that according to IMDb: This catalogued like one for all time dates Movie from the 50 worse films. OK OK, is bad but not as much. Trying to copy many of popular romantic films not always brings a positive side, Dates Movie can make us laugh until the fatigue, but also it gets to feel to us disgusted by the exposed scenes. If, the script is of the worse thing, but this film is characterized in its good parts, by the corporal expression, Alyson Hannigan manages to establish a good balance in the terrible plot, doing to loosen to us one that another outburst of laughter. I go to him well the comedy to Aalyson, I like her performance like another one of the good scenes of the film when they do a scene to him to \"Meet The Fockers\" with the aid of Jennifer Coolidge. If single you want to happen pleasant awhile in the cinema, this is of the best options, I contradict to all those critical that squashed the film. And it is that the beginning of films could not to be better, obese Alyson trying to look for a man and what does is to seduce it the rate of \"Milkshake\", the scene that never you forgot, laugh"

Turns out I had never actually watched it so I decided to boot it up, without knowing what the reviews were it for like. I was a fan of the Scary Movie films and must have bought this around the same time it was released but I have no memory of doing so. Either way, I thought this was decent fun. Nothing mind expanding obviously but the extremely high number of gags with one being uttered seemingly in every sentence means that plenty of them do hit. Was cool to see some well known actors in this and it has surprisingly high production values and looks the part.\n\nThe DVD itself contains its own anti-commentary, a neat feature I've never seen before. There's also some commentary tracks with the directors and the cast members. The extras ranged from pointless to entertaining, the 'romantic screensavers' just don't need to be there!\n\nYeah it's not that good but it's not horrible."

I am rarely the person who says \"that was crap\". Usually, I'll like a thing even if it sucks. I'll say \"well. It had its moments\". But this movie. No way. It was so bad I was tempted to ask for my money back. I barely laughed once, mind you, the 12-year-olds in the row in front laughed plenty at the fart jokes, but frankly, I'd seen better. I have an older brother. If anyone reading this hasn't seen the movie, and are a bit like me - would be inclined to give it the benefit of the doubt - then well, see for yourself. I doubt I can stop you. But don't say I didn't warn you. For the rest of you reading this review and would be guided by it I say buy yourself a carry-out and eat up safe in the knowledge your money was well spent."

It's at the very least a far better effort than the other post scary movie 'movies'.\n\nThe plot follows Alyson Hannigan as she attempts to find true love. A lot of comments complain about the film's fat phobia, however the suit only features in the first 15 minutes of the film.\n\nHalf of the jokes fail miserably such as the hairball joke, but some work fine. It's quite quickfire, lowbrow humour and there's nothing very complex in here, but for a parody film from the mid 2000s you couldn't expect anything else.\n\nActing is decent for the genre, Eddie Murphy actually is quite funny as Julia Jones' father.\n\nCinematography and choreography are also decent and it looks professionally done and not cheap.\n\nMediocre comedy but not one of the worst ever made."

It really isn't *that* bad.\n\nMovies like this are generally made as super light comedies: a series of sketches rather than a movie with a plot. That is what you should expect, and if you want more you will just be disappointed.\n\nIf you are looking for something to stimulate your intellectuality, then perhaps you should try books instead? May I suggest philosophy, or perchance mathematics?\n\nIf you are looking for ~80 minutes of light humor and a story you barely have to pay attention to, and you enjoyed the Scary Movie series, then this should be a decent choice.

None of the jokes are funny. The film depends on more slapstick comedy than anything, and it blanatly fails. Not even the \"sex parts\" are good. The film is just terrible. I can't stress it enough. Don't rent this movie. Don't even waste your time. Let's put it this way: Blockbuster basically cut the movie down from the used price of $12.99 US to $4.99 US (the lowest possible) in a matter of two days. It was that terrible. They should collect all the boxes and DVDs and recycle them. Terrible."

Look at the success of the Scary Movie franchise, those movies are good because the people that make them know how to parody scary movies with hilarious results.

The crude jokes and potty humor weren't enough to save this movie from making it a big disaster. It was so bad I don't even want to write a summary about it.\n\nAll I'll say is that it spoofs off from many romantic comedies. King Kong, The Wedding Planner, Hitch, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, When Harry Met Sally, Kill Bill, Along Came Polly, Meet the Fockers, Meet the Parents, Bridget Jones' Diary, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, Sleepless in Seattle, Say Anything, My Best Friend's Wedding, and others. It also included a spoof on the hit TV show, The Bachelor and a spoof on Paris Hilton's burger commercial and Jessica Simpson's car wash scene in her video, 'These Boots Are Made For Walking'. Basically they put too many spoofs in one to make something that should have been funny into something awful. And these are the people who wrote 'Scary Movie'. Perhaps spoofs on scary movies are funnier to do then spoofs on romantic ones.\n\nThe one thing I'm thankful for is that I waited to see this movie at the $1.99 movie theater in my hometown. The ending was better though. the one scene I loved was the Britney Spears/ Kevin Federline scene, in which Britney says she made a mistake hooking up with a back up singer and Kevin saying, \"I got Britney Spears. I'm rich, I'm rich\". But regardless, don't go see this movie. Trust me you won't like it."

Copying every scene from other films, with more exaggeration and grosser humour, does not make a good parody. Likewise, gross out humour in films can be funny (i.e American Pie, Bridesmaids, etc), but using it in every scene and overdoing it is not funny. It seemed that the writers were just trying to be as gross as possible, as that was the only was they could get a laugh. Overall, this movie took the movie references and grossness too far, and wasn't remotely clever or funny."

First of all, there should be a full-scale protest against the film's treatment of the obese.I have always been a thin person, but I have to say that the media's treatment of the obese and other people who don't fit most of our society's standards of attractiveness is unacceptable.After all, the obese aren't necessarily at fault for their condition.Obesity is largely genetically based and isn't always caused by poor diet and lack of exercise.The overweight have enough to deal with without the media adding to their plight.It should be just as taboo to have fat jokes in movies as it is to have ones that are racist and anti-Semitic.\n\nAlso, I'm the sort of person who loves off-color humor, but the jokes in this movie weren't even funny.They were downright disgusting!I had to actually turn my head during the scenes in which Alyson Hannigan was getting \"liposuction\" and in which the cat was humping the human corpse.And whose idea was it to have the cat taking a dump in the toilet? I'm ashamed to admit this, but unlike some of the more intelligent people on this site, I actually sat through the whole thing.Why?Well, for one thing, the movie did have one redeeming feature-a hot guy with a British accent.Also,I wasn't sure I would get a refund for the $8 I paid.\n\n2006 is still young and more bad movies are sure to come, but this one definitely deserves a Razzie!"

The movie was short (only 80 min.) but it was the longest 80 minutes of my life and i wished it was shorter. Anything would have been a better use of my time then watching this movie.

I actually liked the chemistry that the main couple in the movie had. I really liked them as single actors as well, The guy was cute and lovable and he was funny as well, and the girl was just really easy to like. Some of the gags were too crude and just kind of fell flat and it wasn't really a funny movie overall. I don't know I mean some scenes were actually kind of entertaining and a little bit amusing, but the scenes that weren't funny overpowered the scenes that were. I thought the comical orgasm scene from when Harry Met Sally was kind of clever, but other than that I mean the rest of the gags were just kind of worn. So that's why I'm giving this movie a five out of 10, I'm giving it a five for being better than other parody films I've seen, and because I liked the chemistry between the two main characters."

Ironically the funniest scene in the movie was with Shaq and Dr. Phil...no wait that was Scary Movie 4, I guess Date Movie didn't have any funny scenes.\n\nI gave 5 points just out of pity for having a good comedic idea ruined by poor directing and horrid acting.

As expected, this film takes pretty accurate pot-shots at films like WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, PRETTY WOMAN, MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING, BRIDGET JONES' DIARY, MEET THE PARENTS, MEET THE FOCKERS, NOTTING HILL, and MY BIG FAT Greek WEDDING. Hannigan, a proved farceur thanks to her work in the American PIE movies and the CBS series HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER, plays Julia with sincerity and energy and Adam Campbell, who looks like David Spade and sounds like Hugh Grant, perfectly inhabits the role of Adam. There are also funny bits contributed along the way by Eddie Griffin, Fred Willard, Jennifer Collidge (in a dead-on spoof of Streisand in MEET THE FOCKERS), Sophie Monk, and Tony Cox. It's become fashionable to trash films of this ilk, but it held my attention and made me laugh and if you're looking for a film that will tickle the funny bone, laughs can be had here."

That movie had proper direction and some great jokes (and some hot exposure hehe) even though it specifically spoofed only Teen Movies.\n\nThis movie had the wider canvas of all romantic comedies and even though this gave the movie more potential this also proved to be the movies undoing. This movie had no direction it chose to spoof almost any movie (such as kill bill and went of track a fatal mistake in spoofs) and spoofed movies that were not necessarily legendary. The spoofs were repetitive, to slapstick and focused to much on my best friends wedding.\n\nThe acting was good (from the entire cast) given the limited premise of the movie but too much focus was given on Alyson who has no screen presence and is incapable of carrying a movie on her extra thin shoulders. She may have had some success in multi-star movies but she has neither the capabilities nor the charisma to be the star of a movie.\n\nThe movie started of on a high not with the take on Shallow Hal and the opening scene was brilliant setting my expectations very high and making the disaster that followed all the more unbearable.\n\nThe movie progressively got more and more stupid and after the 35th minute around where Sophie Monk manages to break up the marriage is where the movie becomes truly unbearable. The other half hour of the movie is hideous and you spend the entire time hoping this movie was over.\n\nThe movie has its moments though such the hilarious opening sequence and the scene where the gorgeous Sophie Monk is introduced.\n\nSophie Monk I daresay was the only saving grace in this movie with her spectacular looks and her hilarious take on Paris.\n\nThis movie has a host of scattered moments throughout the movie they are few and far between you are probably better of watching the teasers or the 6 min movie (called the quickie) on the DVD.\n\nThe songs in this movie were one thing that were well put to use and provided some relief when they were played.\n\nA few scenes such as the extended family dinner and the singing of say a prayer, the fake orgasm, and scenes involving the parents were absolutely unbearable.\n\nA movie that may have its moments provided you are able to leave all your senses aside but not even as funny as its teaser.\n\nWatch only if you are super lover of spoofs or if you want to torture yourself.\n\n+s short length, a few great scenes , good jokes but funnier in the teaser, Sophie monk\n\n-s no direction whatsoever, Alyson,s non-star abilities, misguiding unrated DVD, tooooo stupid in parts, TOTAL WASTE OF POTENTIAL.\n\ntotal 3.5/10"

I thought the trailer was funny and gave it a chance but it was the worst movie experience of my life. Not only was the acting and plot horrible, some of the \"jokes\" were so sick and non-humorous....they took things way too far. Plus, I was stuck in a cinema filled with annoying teenagers who were there trying to impress the girls/boys that were there with. If you are wanting to waste two hours of your life, see the movie..but if you're like me and value each minute of your life, DON'T WATCH IT as it was 2 hours of my life that I will NEVER get back.\n\nSincerely, shanalan33"

I don't think I chuckled, giggled, snorted, smiled or even remotely gained consciousness once. The only good thing i could say about this movie is i didn't have to pay to see it. The guy behind me eh well he loved it, laughing, crying but yes he was actually 10 and had snook in with his mates, The parodies were lame not even to half the standard of scary movie and other pants like Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteen, the adverts for the movie did in fact contain all the humour itself. Alyson Hannigan lovely actress stick to good stuff, cant think of any you have done but try and steer away from the depths of hell your career is heading towards. Anyway all round a bad film which should be avoided at all costs even when it is offered to you free. If i could give it -10 out of 10 i would and still not think it satisfactorily"

Yes, as in any other movie, this movie has bad scenes, the type of scenes that you wonder why did they have to do that, but it's just a few and short.\n\nThe movie is of the type of scary movie. It makes fun of other movies and it's all sarcastic and neat. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone."

I would slap all of you but its unfortunate that I cannot. Friedberg and Seltzer are not perfect directors in any means, but I think they're movies are funny. VERY, VERY funny. Very few people are afraid to talk about movies like this because if they say they like it their opinion is silenced with death threats. Stop being ignorant you guys. This movie is not hilarious by any means but it is funny in some parts.\n\nJulia Jones is a overweight Greek, Indian, Japanese Jew who works at her parent's Greek restaurant. She meets the perfect man and becomes beautiful later on. They plan to get married but will her farther approve of this and will another woman get in the way? The Casting for this film was the start of casting the same people in all of their movies. Tony Cox, Adam Campbell and Carmen Electra are most of the people who show up in these kinds of movies.\n\nFriedberg and Seltzer prove that you don't need good jokes to make a good movie. You can have good and bad jokes as well to make a good movie. I love slapstick in these type of movies because they work so well. For me that is, because my taste in comedy is different then everyone Else's. One of my favorite jokes is the beginning of the film where Julia dances on the street to get a man but fails and falls flat.\n\nBut the second half and third act of this film isn't quite that funny. Sure there is a laugh here and there but its not like there are so many at once. I guess they were being more serious with this movie then any of they're other parodies.\n\nDate Movie is not perfect by any means necessary. But it is funny for me. By the way, Im going to be reviewing all of their films. So you just stay tuned for the same stuff! 79/100 B"

Scene's including an orgasmic food order and a cat defecating for several minutes in a toilet, are juvenile at best, yet deliver the chuckles! A scene involving a transvestite \"Pretty Women\" agreeing to engage in sodomy with another women proved to be especially amusing. I also found it hilarious when the princess of the story finds herself being pimped much like the cars on pimp my ride.\n\nThe failed attempts... A brief attempt at Parodying \"Napoleon Dynamite\" was made, unfortunately it failed to be as funny as the already comical original. The \"Meet the Fockers\" parody was exactly the same as the original film, and although amusing, was half-a**ed and not in the true spirit of parody.\n\nBottom Line- Could the film have been better? Oh my yes! However, with the parodies of late \"Date Movie\" stacks up well against the others!"

Oh how Marlon and Shawn must be laughing, because this really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! On the way in to the cinema, I was queuing up for my ticket, when one of the employees, who I occasionally have a quick chat to, advised me not to go and see this movie, I thanked him but said that there have been other movies people have advised me against watching which I really enjoyed.(Pearl Harbor, I am ashamed to say), however, after the movie I saw him in the foyer and offered my apologies, it really was that bad. Alyson Hannigan is not a leading lady, she cant carry it off unlike other teen movie stars (eg, Gellar, Love Hewitt), let alone in a movie like this. Eddie Griffin tries his hardest, but with such a weak character being written for him, he doesn't get his chance to shine. Adam Campbell, the male lead, battles on heroically, but as a rookie in the business, you wonder whether this movie has set him back before he has even got started. Please avoid this movie at all costs, stick with the Scary Movies, because they know how to make fun of other movies, this is a shocking crash-and-burn attempt."

There were countless parodies, but most of the time, they didn't fit the storyline (when there seemed to be one) and they just weren't funny. I almost left halfway through, but I thought it might be one of those movies that gets better after the first 20 or 30 minutes...unfortunately the movie was only about an hour long, and nothing got better.

Date Movie is a new super-hybrid genre of comedy that must only amuse Hollywood Executives during their pitching meetings - like a dog whistle it's gags are totally inaudible to humans.\n\nIn short if you want to see something better than this, de-tune your TV and sit and watch static for 83 minutes."

After this opening sequence we find our heroine Julia Jones in her families big fat Greek style restaurant. This whiter than white chubby girl has a black father and Indian mother. Funny huh?

Oh, when you look at Alyson Hannigan's face you'll feel in aw.\n\nThe acting was decent. Who cares? This film is not trying to win an Oscar, nor a Razzie. This film only tries to make the audience laugh and it does it. Some spoofs were funny, like Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Others were stupid, like Napoleon Dynamite. There is one joke to another. Some will make you laugh and some will make you think, \"Why did these people think this is funny?\" This film is good for many reasons. One is for Alyson Hannigan. She makes the film good. Another reason is that this is a new genre of spoofing. As to Airplane!, the characters don't act like they're funny, but in here, they try to act funny, which is kinda bad, if you ask me, but still, it's a new turn for spoof movies.\n\nIf you just like to watch a dumb comedy, go watch this movie. Shut off your brain and enjoy the movie. It might not be as bad as you thought it was. The jokes are funny and stupid. This is a decent film. Give this movie a chance."

Well, at least a film that boasts having writers from scary movie, and then delivers jokes that only people with serious mental problems would laugh at. The one funny thing in the film was a background shot with Michael Jackson luring a child with a teddy, but that joke has been done already, a million times. I expected more, scary movie was sometimes too stupid too laugh at, but in parts also made me crease, this made me want to start a rampage to get the film taken off the screen. I love films and have never wanted to walk out of the cinema, until i saw this film, because oh my god, it was crap. this film should come with a warning, telling you just how bad it is, and to stay away if you have any respect for the art that is film making. JUST PLEASE Don't GO AND SEE IT!"

There is an actual story line which you somewhat might care what happens at the end. I gave it a 5 just because Eddie Griffin is in this movie and he is funny. The story is rather copies of several famous movies which I am sure by seeing it you can easily recall, The character replacements with the original movie actors are really funny and I think that's why I find it more interesting than Scary Movies. There are scenes that have nothing to do with the movie but there are there just to fill in blanks in the movie I guess. Other than that don't waste your time watching this movie unless someone is lending it to you or it's HBO or something. It was Canada Day and i had nothing better to do..loll\n\ncheers"

My friend wanted to see Date Movie, but I wanted to see Poseidon, but since we were celebrating her we decided to go and see Date Movie. Once we were seated and the movie began, I knew that this wasn't going to be as i expected. Date Movie is the kind of film you can watch once and think it's funny, but never again! It was the most awful movie I've seen so far. You get a couple of laughs, but the rest is just boring and disgusting. Afterwards I wish we went to see Poseidon instead. I can't see why anyone would even bother to make this movie. It was a waste of my time."

The real reason I'm commenting is because I am utterly bewildered by how unfunny this movie was. There are so many things in this movie that absolutely SHOULD have been funny. Things like a cat taking a really noisy and long BM on the toilet. In concept that sort of thing is hilarious to me, yet the filmmakers of Date Movie managed to somehow make this extremely unfunny. One of the biggest downfalls of this is that they are spoofing comedies. I'm not the smartest fella, but isn't the point of spoof to poke fun at something that takes itself seriously? I don't know, maybe my sense of humor is out of whack. Avoid this one."

The type of comedy being portrayed is one that being fat is unlovable, tell me more about you body hair is unsexy, and is ugly. I understand it's a comedy and it suppose to be satire or something but it just doesn't hit. The times have passed this movie like it was standing still.

I sat back into my chair preparing myself for complete boredom. The hopeless gags seemed to go on for eternity and I felt myself getting more and more p*ssed off. Thankfully about two thirds of the way through the film the screen projector broke so me and my friends took this as a perfect opportunity to leg it. I'm just glad that I didn't have to endure the rest of the film. There was nothing willing me to stay. I couldn't have cared LESS what happened at the end of this pathetic movie. I just feel sorry for the other thousands of people who had to sit through this torture and feel the need to tell others. There are already lots of comments saying how blatantly awful this film was.

The reason most people probably think it's crap is because they're so used to mainstream movies and idealisms of what comedy should be about, and aren't open to different comedy styles. This movie was hilarious in many different ways. I dunno, maybe people just didn't want to watch it because there was no violence. Yes the Scary Movie quadrilogy is very unique and amusing, but that doesn't mean you have to base your opinions of every other movie apon them. The style of this movie is very well done and smart for those of you who are interested in paying attention to the plot line, which isn't half bad for a romantic comedy. If you want to watch a good, funny movie then I suggest you watch this movie, it has a lot of parodies and is very enjoyable."

I did enjoy some of this movie, like the When Harry met Sally table scene but there is a lot going on in this movie that is so forced that you just cant bring yourself to laugh. I'm not saying this is a horrible movie, but it could have been better, I'm just not sure how. There are so many good spoof movies out there now that its hard to be original and Date Movie is far from original. I do have to admit I laughed out loud a few times watching this movie and will probably watch this movie again from time to time.

Humor many times is pretty stupid, and when you see someone reenacting a scene from a major movie, you even wonder about their creativity, but it's also a way to make fun of some blockbusters that everyone loves and no one dares to question. Therefore, Date Movie is for me a good comedy movie, of course is not getting an Oscar, maybe a Strawberry, but if you keep in your mind that you wanna forget stress and worries, and just let go, it's OK. However, if you can get someone else to pay the rent of the DVD, you will be saving a couple of dimes for sure."

I've heard horrible reviews about films I found enjoyable and vice versa, so relying on professional and/or amateur film reviewers is rarely the best way for me to gauge whether or not I want to see a flick.\n\nI knew that DATE MOVIE was directed by a couple of the guys who did the Scary MOVIE series', and my kids (17-year-olds, mind you) love them. I'd sat through the first Scary MOVIE and found it relatively funny at times, if a bit crude. But there was some care taken with the filming of it (the homage paid to THE EXORCIST was actually quite well done) so I thought maybe I'd find something similar here.\n\nNo such luck....\n\nLike Scary MOVIE, DATE MOVIE takes its jabs at a film genre, only this time, instead of horror, it's romance movies of the past fifty years (all the way back to THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH which starred Marilyn Monroe). But, unlike Scary MOVIE, DATE MOVIE doesn't pay much homage in a very artistic or funny/flattering way to those wonderful films. The jokes are just thrown in \u0097 without rhyme or reason \u0097 and shot without regard for the surrounding environment (most teenagers probably won't give a flying whoopty-doo about that but others most certainly will). Bathroom humor rules the roost here as we see the infamous cat from MEET THE PARENTS taking a raucously loud dump in a toilet with full sound effects (yes, I did laugh here, but it was about the only place) and extremely, extremely, extremely forced sexual connotations are smeared in the audiences face by the beautiful Carmen Electra.\n\nPulling skits from NAPOLEON DYNAMITE, JERRY MAGUIRE, and WHEN HARRY MET SALLY (among dozens of others), the film tried too hard to use the comedy it could've easily pulled off with a less heavy-handed effort. Alyson Hannigan, as the main character Julia Jones, gives the shallowest performance of her career. Adam Campbell as her love interest, Mr. Grant Funkyerdoder, was entertaining but obviously trying to make more out of the script than was possible.\n\nThe supporting cast was equally terrible, unable to get any truly laugh-out-loud moments across to the audience.\n\nI think the race for Worst Film of the Year has officially begun."

No more movie-making for you cretins 'til you put down the pipe and grow some brains!\"\n\nI actually feel bad for the actors trapped in this film. Nobody's big-time, A-List famous here, but there are a number of familiar faces you'll recognize from other movies and TV shows (besides the lead, Alyson Hannigan).\n\nIt was genuinely painful to watch all these actors try so very hard to make this movie funny and involving when the writing and directing was just so bad, just so absolutely lame throughout, that there was nothing they could really do.\n\nYes, this film has about eight truly hilarious jokes in it -- but unfortunately, three of them come in the first fifteen minutes or so, and this movie is about ninety minutes long. The rest of the so-called jokes are just unbelievably weak, or simply not funny. Some of the jokes are actually pretty offensive -- but not in that South Park \"offensive but funny\" way. They just kinda make you go, \"Why the fugg did they do THAT???\"\n\nSeriously folks, stay away from Date Movie. I'm trying to save you some money here. Don't make the same mistake I did.\n\nAnd if you see the director and the writer, tell them I want my rental money back -- and smack each of them upside the head for me. Twice."

I don't know if it's just me, but it looks like producers of this kind of movies are completely run out of ideas. Seems like the all good jokes are used up in first five or six movies of this genre. Main gags in newer parodies are consisted in farting, puking, burping ... etc. And who makes parody on comedies at all ? Since two minuses gives an plus - it is logical that two pluses equals minus.\n\nBottom line: If you want to have some fun, and you don't find puking and farting funny - avoid Date Movie."

After fifteen minutes, I was so bored, so disgusted, so annoyed, and so absolutely infuriated with this wretched piece of cat bile that I couldn't resist the urge to switch the DVD player off and go off to do something else.\n\nSome movies are dated immediately when they come out. For a while, I thought that this was only for decades past: the 50's, the 60's, 70', 80's, etc. This is one of the few movies I can safely say future generations will look upon and immediately shout \" 2006!\" Really! ' Milkshake', 'Pimp my Ride', 'Hitch', 'Napoleon Dynamite', 'The Bachelor', and so many more. ( So, so, so many more.....) This would be acceptable, if it managed to be funny. But this objective was apparently so alien to the writers, they seem to take great strides to avoid this goal.\n\nTake the beginning for incident: corpulent protagonist is in a park reciting nuptials to.....wait for it....Napoleon Dynamite. He cranes his head, scrunches his face, and utters, \" I won't marry you! Gosh!\" ( Something to that effect, it's been a while since I've seen the movie, and it sure didn't strike me as memorable.) I was sitting there, nodding my head. Indeed, I had seen Napoleon Dynamite, and that was sorta how he behaved. So what's funny about that? That's how Napoleon Dynamite behaves! There's no joke in there! I was waited for a little while for the punch line, but it never came! There are so many things 'parodied' in this mess that the plot seems to lose track over itself. In the Scary Movie series, it seems they would take several horror movies and focus on them primarily, ( In number 3 it was The Ring and Signs,) while all the others references were pretty much sidebars, nice little snippets that came and went. Not so in 'Date Movie'. I was assaulted with the darkest parts of modern pop culture in such a short span I got nauseous, fast.\n\nAll in all, avoid this catastrophe. Check out the 'Hot Shots!' series or 'Top Secret' to see what the parody genre is all about. Not in any way should this squalid fecal matter be associated with what is otherwise an extremely funny area of movies."

        "review_detailed_main": "A few years ago some people got the idea of making a spoof of horror movies by stringing some of the better known clich\u00e9s together in a kind of story (Scream) \u0096 well they didn't exactly think of the idea \u0096 it had been done for years better and on a tiny budget by the anti-establishment filmmakers Troma who parodied Hollywood relentlessly and achieved cult following. But the Scream series appeared to a certain crowd that enjoyed spotting takes on scenes from their favourite horror films delivered with Hollywood polish and comedy resulting from the similarities. They had a certain panache and were reasonably gripping at first, but by Scream 3 and Scary Movie 3, the device was wearing a bit thin. Some of the writers/directors/producers decided to milk it a bit further and try a parody of date movies but the formula doesn't appear to work very well for a number of reasons.\n\nFirstly the 'date' movies on which this film relies are mostly romantic comedies and contain reasonable humour and romantic tension, varying from superficial to award winning. Date Movie, on the other hand, is rarely funny, even when it is trying the 'joke that is so awful it's laughable' routine. As good parody, it loses any strength it might have had by making the films it imitates too obvious, even dressing and making up the actors to look like the stars. The resultant lack of subtlety means there is no satisfaction in guessing \u0096 it can only call on gross-out humour of the American Pie variety. The problem with this is that the extreme attempts at coarseness lose their impact early on for lack of story line and also that this type of extreme toilet humour probably repels the very audiences that went to see the original romantic comedies. Date Movie is anything but a date movie.\n\nIt also pushes bad taste in a way that I struggled to justify. 'The Office' TV series parodied politically incorrect or obnoxious behaviour in a way that eventually made the viewer feel uncomfortable about it, achieving its aim with ingenious humour and a string of Baftas and Golden Globes; but Date Movie has none of the self-consciousness of The Office or even the Troma movies such as Tromeo and Juliet, Toxic Avenger or Terror Firmer. Even if the lampooning of overweight, ugly or midget people doesn't upset you, the callous scene where the happy couple play a romantic game of gleefully beat up a homeless man may raise your hackles to the point where you find it difficult to forgive the filmmakers (I had to search to find what this was supposedly parodying \u0096 apparently a direct to video DVD called 'Bumfights' that is one of the rare films banned these days by the BBFC.) I must admit that the following night, after consuming several pints of very strong lager, I was however laughing almost uncontrollably into my pint at the memory of blonde bombshell Sophie Monk doing a \"Don't you Wish Your Girlfriend Was Hot Like Me\" routine to upset the newly to-be-weds, but with that amount of alcohol probably even Chicken Little would have had me in stitches.\n\nA last dregs possibility for a drunken lads night out, Date Movie fails on most other levels, and hardly a movie to take your date on unless you are both very drunk, fed up with even good romantic comedies, and find each other's loud and uncontrolled rectal noises hilariously funny."

The story is seriously lame, it just didn't work at all, it was like having your teeth being pulled out one-by-one. The acting was absolutely horrible except for Alyson Hannigan, which isn't saying much because she was the only one who could actually act.

I wonder if the two of the six 'writers' of Scary Movie actually took part in Scary Movie because that was a hell of a lot funnier than this.

Confusing itself with a spoof it's forced to string together its random and oh-so-apt gags with what is essentially a sincere romance storyline. So the essence of what this film is spoofing is exactly what it relies on to lifeboat the audience from one poorly executed reference to another.\n\nHow on Gods earth they thought they could spoof a comedy (Meet The Fockers) keeps me awake at night. I have actually witnessed better executed satire on \"The Amanda Show\" And even as a fellow Australian, if I'd seen Sophie Monk's leathery, malnourished form, greased up and clutching the worlds most unappetizing burger you would had to have pried the ready cocked gun from my mouth.\n\nOf course there are people who will think this movie is great and hilarious, however if you're over 14 my strong and forceful suggestion is; do not donate another cent toward this film. If you must, do so only so you can demand it back once the midget joke forces you from the theater."

And Alyson Hannigan is in the plus column, so... what the heck, maybe I'll even like it if I let go of my prejudice.\" I was so, horribly wrong.\n\nI consider spoof humor the lowest form of comedy; lower even than slapstick and fart jokes. And \"Date Movie\" is only spoof humor. Well, that's not true; there is some slapstick and a fart joke, too. But really, just because you recognize a scene as being lifted from another film, that does not automatically make it funny. You have to work a spoof a little more than that to get a laugh from me. Spoofing a genre is fine and can be funny; just recreating a scene from another film or quoting a line from a different, better movie is lazy.\n\nRarely (if ever) have I seen something so uninspired, so by the numbers. Back in the golden age of cinema, they used to call something a \"programmer\" if it was made to fit a particular genre and niche in the marketplace. At least most of those were made by professional, competent filmmakers. \"Date Movie\" isn't even that. It's just something to fill up the multiplexes between the last \"American Pie\" sequel and the next Tom Cruise picture.\n\n\"Date Movie\" is the worst thing any movie can be: boring. And at only an hour and thirteen minutes, that's no mean feat. Stay away from it. Please.\n\nOh, and Carmen Electra? She's in the final sixty seconds of the film getting fondled by King Kong. Har.

It seemed like Jinxers the cat was the only funny part, and Jinxers was like a puppet. That's just a little bit sad. They tried to make parodies but it did not work, like \"The Lord Of The Rings\" parody they tried to pull off.\n\nThe actors and actresses were horrible. They had no acting talent. There was major holes in the movie,and it was just another boring, horrible movie. I do not recommend spending money on this movie. (The Main guy isn't even attractive)"

Maybe they want to make something similar when they saw the Scare Movie trilogy's success. So they decide to make a odd romance version of it. However...the storyline is stupidly awful, most of the scenes in Date Movie are just disgusting. I don't know in some funny scenes I should laugh or just feel \"unconfortable\". Perhaps, that's the best euphemism to appreciate the film director \"great work\". Personally, I think this so-called film should never be released to theaters. Maybe the surprisingly box office success is because of Alyson Hannigan and the title Date Movie, but that's not what a comedy or romance should be done like this. This is a rip-off. Beware of it."

I thought it was a little bit risky putting \"The funniest movie i have ever seen\" as the summery but i have simply not laughed as much as i did during Date Movie.

We were really excited about going to see this movie, but I wish we had gone to see something else. I don't think this is a spoiler, but the main movie that was spoofed was \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding.\" The girl was Greek, her father was black, her mother was Indian, and her sister was Japanese.

        "review_detailed_main": "The Scary Movie franchises might be the same old stuff every time, but you could usually find some genuine laughs in all four of them, even if they recycle the same jokes. Both the Wayans' and Zucker made their movies unique to their own style, and on most levels, they each panned out to where you can enjoy them if you just turn your brain off and smile.\n\nUnfortunately, with this movie, that luxury does not exist. It really, really, does not exist. I'm going to take a guess and say that the two of the six writers from the Scary Movie series that took on this project, were the ones who had the luxury of writing the most obvious jokes from the film series (i.e. the 'i've taken balls to the face before' line from Scary Movie 4).\n\nUnfortunately for everyone, or maybe fortunately if you think my writing or opinion is crap, I can't give this a full review. What I can do though, is honestly state that this is the only movie in the past few years that I have purposely turned off. Oh yes, I sat through Phat Girlz, and yes, I sat through Kangaroo Jack. This one, however, I just could not muster up the strength to make it. I got maybe a half hour in before I just walked away.\n\nIf you're a parent, or are around a child of about ten-twelve years old, imagine every joke that you have heard from that child, and you've pretty much got the script of this movie. And unless said child is a miniature George Carlin, you know that is a bad sign. You can see every joke coming about ten miles away. Even if you know what movie they're about to make fun of, you can still accurately guess which parts they will be parodying, and I use that term very loosely. Not only is this movie obvious in its attempts at mustering up laughter, it's sometimes just painful to watch because the jokes are so rehashed that you might find it uncomfortable to view because you know that at the time, these people actually thought this would be a good idea."

I think a good rule of thumb to follow for future spoofs, aside from actually being funny, would be to not spoof comedies. Maybe it can work but it absolutely falls flat in this waste of film. The only good thing that came out of going to see this was when we walked out we snuck into Firewall which was just starting. Not a great movie, but in comparison to what we had just left we agreed it should have gotten an Oscar."

This has got to be the most horrible movie I've seen. Even worse than \"White Chicks!\" Julia Jones is a 389 pound woman dreaming of one day finding true love. Working at her Greek Indian Jewish Japanese family's restaurant one day, she meets Grant. Grant finds her beautiful, even though she is a 389 woman. Desperate after being told by her father that she is marrying Nicky, a dim-witted employee, she rushes to Hitch. Hitch is played by Tony Cox, which I have to say, was kind of funny. Hitch \"pimps Julia out\" with the help of the West Coast Customs crew. Julia suddenly becomes a slender woman.\n\nMeeting both sets of parents, you never really get to know anyone because the movie goes by too fast. Well, as you know, spoofs of \"Meet the Parents\" and \"Meet the Fockers\" reveal that Julia's parents don't like Grant at first and Grant's mother is a sex therapist and his father enjoys dance fighting.\n\nWith parodies that are just scattered throughout when unneeded and gross out humor that isn't funny one bit, \"Date Movie\" could easily win every Razzie for 2006. The MPAA obviously was mistaken when they gave this film a PG-13 rating. I've seen R-rated movies that weren't even this bad (content wise.) Save your time and your money, this one should be in a dump somewhere."

There even are some nice ideas in it, but these are spoiled by bad dialog, bad acting, bad directing, bad everything. Alyson Hannigan grows even sweeter with age, and we know she does have talents as a comedian. But for the largest part of this movie it's not being used by the script nor the director. Many of the sequences have absolutely no function in the movie and are completely disconnected from everything else. So are most of the characters. You just can't figure out what they're here for. So the only reason to suffer through this flick is being a fan of Alyson and yearning for one of the rare glimpses of her lovely face. I found scary movie 4 really bad - this is worse. Much worse."

Don't see this movie. i am one of those people that looks at a movie people call bad and say that the movie had some good parts.

Before the walk down the aisle they have to meet his parents Bernie (Willard)& Roz (Coolidge),get a wedding planner (Ortiz) and deal with Grant's former fianc\u00e9e Andy (Monk)whose trying to stop her best friend's wedding. It wasn't what I would call a fantastic film it was just another silly and crazy comedy the one scene that looked romantic was when he was standing under her bedroom window serenading her with a song from his stereo. It reminded me of John Cusack when he was trying to win back Ione Skye's love in Say Anything. 5/10"

There were too many jokes in the movie that would have actually been a little funny if the timing was better, or they used some different wording. Most of the time though, they gave you a punch line with no lead in. All you can do is sit there and wonder whether or not you should be laughing. It may be true that I like a higher level of comedy than I expected from this movie, but I still found some jokes in Scary Movie funny. This movie just takes jokes from other movies, changes character names (into ones that are actually less funny than the original movies...I mean come on...his name could have been Will...) and adds a slightly different, and usually less funny scene. Unless you have always wanted to see the worst movie ever made, don't waste your time. You will have more fun counting toothpicks for an hour and a half."

I found \"Date Movie\" at times hard to watch, because it, perhaps more than \"Scary Movie\" and \"Not Another Teen Movie\" relies much more on other films, and spoofs far more, or so it seemed, films than its predecessors. At times it was difficult to watch because I was trying to work out where the scene was from, while paying attention to all that was going on. But it was fun nonetheless.\n\nThe cast are certainly a mixed bunch. Alyson Hannigan deserves a lot of praise for her work here as she carries the film, not to mention having great hair. Adam Campbell is rather boring as Grant Funkyerdoder, but Jennifer Coolidge is terrific as his mother, Roz, and she spoofs Barbara Striesand so well. Eddie Griffin is okay, but sometimes annoying as Hannigan's character Julia Jones' father, Frank, yes, weird, he is black and she is white, well it gets weirder - her mother Linda, played by the fabulous Meera Simhan is Indian (and doesn't get nearly enough screen time), and her sister Betty, played by Marie Matiko is Asian, (and also doesn't get enough screen time).\n\nTony Cox is okay as Hitch (spoofing Will Smith), while Valery Ortiz is awesome as Jell-O, spoofing Jennifer \"J-Lo\" Lopez and her \"Wedding Planner\" film - seriously she's probably the best spoof in the entire film! Sophie Monk from Australi's Bardot is hilarious as Andy. Also look out for Beverly Polcyn as the Old Cat Woman - some might remember her as Sadie (the Never Been Kissed old lady) from \"Not Another Teen Movie\".\n\nAt times the film goes a bit over the top and can be very crude - like the whole thing with the cat, a spoof from \"Meet the Fockers\". Two of the best scenes by far would the opening dance scene to Kelis' \"Milkshake\" song, (though it is a bit disturbing too), and the singing scene at the wedding dinner, which is taken right out of \"My Best Friend's Wedding\", and is hilarious. There are heaps of references to \"date\" movies and actors that have worked in them, and also a sort-of out-of-place scene taken from \"Pimp My Ride\", which works well however. Check it out, it's not as bad as some people say."

The premise of the movie has obviously been done before and done to death but, to a naive teenager who has never seen the originals that are being spoofed, it is original, fresh and new. Note: they also enjoyed \"Scary Movie\" so this gives an idea of their level of humour. But, give it a chance, it may not be your cup of tea, nor is it a critical success, or even a brilliant bit of film-making, but there is an audience out there for this kind of movie."

I normally can handle grossness, and I tend to thrive on silly comedies like Old School and Grandma's Boy so you'd think I could take this, but no. I think mainly because instead of bathroom humor, they just opted for the bathroom. I like the concept of lampooning trite romantic comedies, but they missed the mark on this one.

She gets \"pimped\" (becoming beautiful), falls in love, plans to get married, and fights with her boyfriend's ex as the film spoofs \"Meet the Fockers\", \"The Wedding Planner\", \"Napoleon Dynamite\" and many more.

Based on this, Date Movie seems like a good premise - as there are countless bad troupes and cliches in the romance and rom-com genres. However, Date Movie almost always failed to exploit this. It is difficult to describe how bad most of the jokes are in this film, because they are superficially the same as the jokes in Scary Movie except they are just not funny. The comedic timing is totally off, and most of the jokes are so obvious - without self-awareness - that they cannot be enjoyed by people that would ordinarily appreciate that sort of humour. This leaves the film feeling extremely cringey and honestly difficult to watch. Without good jokes, the film is completely pointless and a total waste of time. Do not bother watching, re-watch one of the Scary Movie's instead - they are so much better."

After some non-starters such as action movie spoof Action! Or high concept comedy Happy Place failing to gain traction, the duo landed their first directing gig with an untitled rom-com pitch for Regency the duo were also slated to direct. The movie became a hit thanks to its low budget and success among teenagers and despite the critical derision gave Seltzer and Friedberg a foothold in cinemas with more \"spoofs\" coming through and defining their legacy.\n\nMost of the jokes can be boiled down to References, unfunny and uncoordinated slapstick, mugging. Despite some good comedians being in the cast like Alyson Hannigan, Fred Willard, and Jennifer Coolidge, they're all pretty much floundering with Hannigan's opening credits dancing sequence in an unconvincing fat-suit setting the tone and expectations pretty low for what's to follow. On occasion maybe one or two of the sight gags will be amusing such as one restaurant being literally named \"A Restaurant\", but mostly the gags and spoofs are pretty surface level servicing at best. As a spoof of romantic comedies there's tons of cliches, tropes, and trappings you can do with the genre to make a good parody, but becomes Seltzer and Friedberg target movies like Legally Blonde, Meet the Fockers/Meet the Parents or My Big Fat Greek Wedding, their go-to ere is basically taking scenes that were already played for comedy in the original context and amping up the mugging and grossout.\n\nDate Movie isn't even really a \"movie\", it's a parade of lowbrow gags daisy chained together into what resembles a movie, similar to the liquids and scrapings of a meat processing plant coming together on the edge of the kill line and forming \"meat product\". As a time capsule of what was once deliverable to audiences in cinemas there's a certain curiosity factor, but for anyone else: keep a distance of at least five feet."

These scenes were literally nothing more than exact replicas of the originals, with slightly more extreme visuals. Fockyerdoder instead of Focker - that's not funny. A two-year-old could do better. The \"I've got nipples, can you milk me?\" skit was even shabby, leaving out key lines. Of course, the pimple-popping segment was not much better; simply puerile.\n\nThe only positive comment that can be made is that this film was better than Scary Movie 2, because I laughed three times instead of zero times. I just feel sorry for the cast: Alyson Hannigan, Eddie Griffen, and that midget whose name I don't know are all good actors, and acted capably in this film, but the script was such trash that it could ruin Johnny Depp's golden career if it wished to."

It was so boring that at one point, I stared at the wall of the movie theatre for nearly 10 minutes cause it was more interesting.\n\nThis was kinda supposed to be a \"funny\" send up of My Big Fat Greek Wedding, but that other movie was much better. This one simply consisted of a series of boring, unfunny, and at times downright off-colour jokes. The fat jokes at the start are a case in point - though the bit where they pimped her up was reasonably funny. The ending was pure fluff, a straight copy of American Pie The Wedding or Wedding Crashers.\n\nI felt sorry for poor Alyson Hannigan who was great in Buffy but I seriously dunno if her career is gonna survive this."

Date Movie takes every potential gag too far and, after it's finished ruining just about every decent romantic comedy, it even resorts to shamelessly parodying TV shows and adverts to try and get a few cheap laughs (which it doesn't). Just when you think that 'Date Movie' can't get any worse, it does, as it progresses from a terrible 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' parody to an even worse 'Meet the Fockers' spoof. The only thing less funny than this movie is the knowledge that I wasted \u00a36 and 2 hours of my life watching it. 'Date Movie' is without doubt the worst parody movie ever made. Don't go see this movie under any circumstances. It ruined my day."

Never in the movie does it show any direction of where it is going.\n\nThe Jokes are a poor whim at humor and juvenile. They lack energy and as the movie is a parody it sticks too closely to the original films.\n\nOverall the DVD is a waste of money and the movie was a waste of my time and film."

The film is vulgar and pointless and it is like a broken record, and it repeats the same unfunny gags and jokes again and again. The movie makes no sense. The movie makes fun of romantic films and it is about an overweight girl who falls in love with a man with a British Accent. Many unfunny gags are used such as a cat making bodily dysfunctions on the toilet and a girl with an over sized butt. The film doesn't even parody the romantic movies, the film just makes them look far better. I didn't laugh once during the whole thing, and the definition of a parody is to make laughs. And that I didn't laugh at all is saying something because I thought that Epic Movie and Vampires Suck were both funny. To summarize this, this movie fails to do what other parody movies have done:exaggerate the parts/elements of a movie to the extent that it is funny. They don't exaggerate, they come up with non-relevant scenes that doesn't pertain at all to a parody movie. This movie is not worth your time. I am trying to save you from this horrible movie."

For those of you who have seen it, I guess you're all still cursing the person who led you into watching this 83 minute piece of s***. This could possibly be the worst movie ever. From the messed up music sequences, crappy sentences, awful dialog, and worst comedy that ever came to film this peace of master crap doesn't deserve to even be stored into a videostore; that's how bad it is. I kicked myself in the head for a good 2 hours after watching this wanting to kill my girlfriend for making me see this + I also smoked about a pack of cigarettes in order to calm down and try to forget what I saw.\n\nBasically, the movie is supposed to be a parody, mostly like the \"Scary Movie\", well it came from some of the same writers didn't it. However, it fails so miserably in laughing at others as that it turns the laughter back at itself, and after a while the laughter becomes a sorrowful look on the face while holding your head with two forefingers and shaking it from side to side in awe how can someone make something that gazantously and horrifically bad. The movies that are 'made fun of' here are about 4 years old and have already been laughed at. Some of the movies being 'laughed at' are actually comedies with actual total copying and sequencing of parts of those comedies, e.g. Meet the Parents which was made in 2000, making it 6 years old... yea they copied ENTIRELY the scene where Ben Stiller knocks over the vase of girls fathers grandmothers ashes.\n\nI have probably already mentioned how bad this movie is, this is why I gave it a 1, but I would actually like to give it a minus billion if I could and I am not gonna stop at that when I say this was the worst piece of s*** the film industry has ever made.

Also, the Kill Bill scene didn't make sense because it's not even a date movie, and it wasn't like it led anywhere, so it was completely unnecessary. As for the jokes; occasionally funny, usually disgusting. The cat, Jinx, caused most of my disgust. The toilet scene was gross and dragged out and the scene with the remains of the dead mother was just corrupt. After that scene, we saw an elderly woman leave with what seemed to be her granddaughter, which was not a surprise. Even Julia's father coughing up a hairball turned my stomach slightly.\n\nThe film should not be a 12A, meaning that children under 12 can see it with parental supervision, which I find shocking, it should be a 15, in my opinion.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone unless I warned them about all of the above and I knew that they could stomach the films content."

Starting in the beginning from Shallow Hal, to Hitch, Kill Bill, A Night At The Roxbury, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Meet The Parents, Meet The Fockers and finally King Kong. But I think the reason it didn't turn up so good because they were spoofing another comedy movie. Meet The Parents/Fockers is the major spoof of the movie. Alysson Hannigon, I dunno why she signed up for this movie, its a sheer waste of time and energy. Carmen Electra does a stupid cameo. The background hip hop/pop music is enjoyable but that just sets the tone of the movie.

Then again, you might not.\n\nMost of the jokes are overdone and overplayed. Subtlety is completely missing. Despite all that, there were a couple of scenes that made me laugh out loud.\n\nThe best part about this movie is the women. Alyson Hannigan does a remarkably good job with what little she has to work with. Sophie Monk is eye candy extraordinaire. Her spoof of Paris Hilton is worth half a rental fee all by itself. Then again, I only paid a dollar for the rental. Outside of that, and one line by Jennifer Coolidge referencing a carrot, there really isn't much to recommend.\n\nEverything else ranges from boring to bad -- really bad. The worst element of all is the predictability. If you have seen the movies being \"spoofed\" you will see the jokes coming from a mile off. If you haven't, then they come off as stupid, childish and extremely crude. That is, when they are detectable as jokes at all.\n\nAll in all, not something I'd recommend as a first choice rental, buuut, on a Saturday night, when everything else is checked out ... maybe as a discounted or free rental, it would be worth it."

I was, literally, laughing the entire time, except for perhaps a ten minute interval somewhere. The entire theater, in fact, was laughing the entire time. It says on the preview that it was written by two of the seven writers of the Scary Movie trilogy. Well, in my opinion, it had to be the funniest two because this movie was funnier than they were. And they were really funny. The actors play the spoofs so well. It's easy to figure out which classics they're poking fun of, which makes it easier for more people to get the jokes. I even got jokes from movies that I haven't even seen. This is definitely something to check out. Tell all your friends."

It's as if the writers, producers, and director understood that these certain parts would translate well on screen, and decided to kill them anyway. The editing and soundtrack is actually adequate, but the acting is far from acceptable. Tony Cox does alright, but he's the exception rather then the rule.\n\nMy wife and I were debating which was worse, Date Movie or BloodRayne. We decided that, while BloodRayne is out and out horrible, it provides more laughs then this movie, and manages to give you some reason to watch it. Date Movie has no merit.

They have halfway decent story lines and have good jokes in them. Date Movie provided maybe about 3 spots where I laughed. Most of it was just utterly stupid, and I was sitting in boredom waiting for it to \"pick up\". Alas, that point never arrived, and I found myself staring at the credits and regretted wasting the $14 or so on this DVD that I will never, ever watch again; and try to curb as many people away from it as possible.

I enjoyed watching the first Scary Movie so I thought this one might be a good one too. Hahaha... wrong!\n\nWhat make movies funny is its surprise element, just like a funny commercial does. You've seen them all right? Budweiser, Miller Lite, Old Spice, Axe, and Wendy's come to mind. These commercials all had a surprise element to it, and that's what made these so funny. This movie had absolutely no surprise element to it. Even a history textbook has more surprise element than this junk.\n\nBut perhaps Date Movie's greatest problem springs from the fact that they try to spoof way too many movies in 80 or so minutes. The problem arises when they try to reenact, superficially, all those scenes from twenty other romantic movies... not to mention Kill Bill (???), and try to be funny. Well, they can't be funny when all they're doing is reenacting them. Remember, reenacting these other films is just like having us see it all over again, and a joke is not funny when told the second time.\n\nDate Movie could have remedied this by just concentrating on two or three movies, not 20, and try to make the scenes more unpredictable and clever. Mr. Seltzer, a word of advice to you: just like other critics say, when you make a parody off of other movies, make sure that the movies you're mocking are not funnier than your own parody."

The best part about this movie after that was a wonderful thing I'd noticed on the website where I'd looked up showtimes- a running time of 83 minutes. Since the opening took about twenty of those up, I figured after enduring five minutes of this festering pile of excretement- which began at that point to really stink up the screen with its tired, played-out gags that weren't relevant in any way to the story- I could at least salvage my $8.50 by getting in a good nap.

At one point in the film there's a parody of \"Kill Bill.\" Not a bad idea, but all that happens is Alison Hannigan dressing up in the signature yellow jumpsuit and carrying a sword. Nothing more than that. That's comedy? I'm not asking for great satire, but at least some effort should be made.\n\nI don't object to lowbrow humor. The farting scene in \"Dumb and Dumber,\" for instance, is a great. But in \"Date Movie\" the best they can do is have the same scene taking place with a cat. Umm, OK. And this is a parody why? Because of cats? In some cases the film attempts to \"parody\" other comedies by virtually lifting entire jokes from other movies and rewording them slightly (for instance from \"Meet the Parents\"). Weak.\n\nIn all, this movie is bad. Skip it. The only reason I am giving this a 2 rather than a 1 is that there ought to be room for very bland comedies like this and cinematic travesty like \"Battlefield Earth.\""

I can't stress this enough. If you aren't under 20, you'll be lost. we're kids, we like parodies. the big ones confuse us. this is what we need. simple humor. adults may not like or appreciate the twisted humor, but i'm sure you're kid will. I liked it. I'm under 20. get the picture. I hope so. A lot of people commenting here shouldn't be making fun of movie unless they themselves have a mainstream movie. Its humor children will get.

Bad direction, lazy editing, horrible cast... so on and so forth. As to how this film managed to pull in near 50 million is a mystery. There was no subtle humor, it was all overdone to the point were the viewer sits back and many points and just has to ask the question - \"what the hell was that all about?\" God help the men who actually used this movie as a \"date movie\", cause let me tell you... no one got lucky that night."

The toilet humor is too much and there is actually too many of those type jokes to make it work. I wasn't able to make in through the entire movie though I tried twice. Luckily, I'm viewing it on cable--Cinemax- and didn't actually go to the theater to pay to see it. If you want to see Alyson Hannigan; watch American Pie or some old Buffy's.

I watched it with three other people; we're not even sure if two of them are going to make it after this. Please please please, don't watch this movie.

I could go on for ages (: Well ... unlike other movies I didn't know anything about the personality of the main character. The story is a joke. The jokes are not funny; maybe one or two were funny if they weren't that long. For example there is that scene where they are playing basketball and the guy jumps against the others sweaty breast and gets all in his mouth. That scene takes like 20 secs. And even if it were shorter, its not funny. I wonder why this movie came into the theaters or even got budget. Well, just dint support this crap by not watching it. Thanks."

        "review_detailed_main": "That my friends, was what actually put me on a theatre seat to sit through the crass comedy Date Movie, with an incredible fat (courtesy of a fat suit) Alyson Hannigan gyrating to Milkshake. Like Scary Movie (hey, written by 2 of the 6 writers you know?), it spoofs its own genre of movies, and here, it's the romance genre.\n\nWhat's the plot? There is no plot to speak of. It's just stringing together a series of spoofs into an 80 minute movie, drawing its material, and this list is not exhaustive, from movies like Briget Jones' Diary, Kill Bill, Meet the Parents, Dodgeball, Meet the Fockers (down to the kid and cat), Pretty Woman, When Harry Met Sally, King Kong, Hitch, etc. Some celebrities also get ribbed, like Mr and Mrs Britney Spears, and Michael Jackson.\n\nBut basically, it's about a fat girl, Julia Jones (Hannigan) working in a Greek Diner (familiar?), having extremely mixed parentage, who falls in love with a Jude Law lookalike - Grant Funkyerdoder. She enlists the help of guru Hitch, and gets herself trimmed down in a car workshop (don't ask). Struggling with constant insecurities, and extremely huge zits, of course don't help. And to make things worse, Grant's ex-fianc\u00e9e Andy (an extremely curvy Sophie Monk, taking the usual sex-kitten turns in washing cars, munching burgers, and scantily clad, if not at all), turns up the heat and tries to wreck Julia's and Grant's upcoming marriage.\n\nWhat else can I say about the acting - it's essentially non-existent. Some sequences, like the Mr and Mrs Smith one, are done pretty accurately, like right down to Brad Pitt's crew cut hairstyle. And if you're not a fan of toilet / crass humour, then you might want to give this movie a miss, especially since it plays up the scenes in the original movies, a way lot worse than intended (swallowing sweaty chest hair anyone?) The only way to possible enjoy a movie like this, is like the old clich\u00e9 goes, by leaving your brains at the door. There are many laugh-a-moments, but after the movie, they're mostly forgotten stuff. Good for destress after a long hard day. And I think my friend Richard would probably enjoy the Kill Bill bits, and oh my, the burgers :-D\n\nP.S. Stay a while during the end credits, there's another Mr and Mrs Smith spoof scene."

It had past movies that it made fun of ex. Mr and Mrs Smith, King kong, hitch etc. I did not find it a good comedy. My friends thought it was horrible and we should get our money back. Franctly i did not like it and i don't think you should waste your money on this 80 min film.The movie showed very little comedy and no one in the theater room was laughing at the possibly \"funny\" parts. I think if anyone would want to see this movie you should rent it when its out of theaters. I was not impressed."

        "review_title": "More of a rip-off than a parody",
        "review_detailed_main": "Parody films have been around for a very long time. Many of the original trendsetters were hilarious films that knew just how to parody certain films to their advantage, and make the audience have a good time. But as time went on, like all genres, it became stale and became unfunny. Now with Date Movie, we have begun to move into the beyond unfunny territory.\n\nExplaining the film would just be a waste of time, but basically, Julia (Alyson Hannigan) wants a boyfriend, but is totally hideous. She gets a makeover, and meets the man of her dreams, Grant (Adam Campbell). From here, they decide they want to get married, but they have to get through a number of obstacles first.\n\nThat was just skimming the top of a movie that just throws in subplots just for the hell of it, just to parody more films. There is no real key film being parodied here, but a number of them. From recent films like My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Meet the Parents/Fockers and Hitch, to classic films like When Harry Met Sally... and Say Anything. It does not even stop at romantic \"date movies\" as their parody material. Kill Bill Volume 1, Napoleon Dynamite, Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings and more have a couple of dedicated minutes thrown in for good measure.\n\nAnd while much of these parodies are totally incorrectly done, there are some that are genuinely hilarious. I was laughing so hard at a few parts, that I felt almost sick to my stomach to think that the majority of the film is just totally unfunny and downright silly. Classic parody films were never as bad, overdone or terribly unfunny as this. Even worse is the fact that the writers/director were involved in the original Scary Movie, which was a great parody film that was downright hilarious (unfortunately, the sequels deteriorated as they went on). In that film, they focused in on their parodies, and crafted them to be funny. Here, they barely do any focusing, and it all feels rushed and just thrown together in an attempt at hoping for the best results to come out of it.\n\nBut what disturbed me the most about this movie was not the lack of hilarity, or the fact that some of the most unfunny jokes in the film were totally overdone, was the fact that much of the film just feels more like a rip-off remake, than a parody. In more than a few instances, it looks like they just ripped the scene right out of the film they are supposed to be parodying, and got the cast to just re-do the scene. This is not parody. This is a rip-off. It upset me to think of how much work many writers went through to make sure they were parodying and not just bringing the same scene back to the screen with new actors. Here, they do exactly what those writers set against doing, and they do it so often, that it just cannot be anything but blatant.\n\nThis film could have been great, had the filmmakers wanted to make a parody and not a rip-off. It's sad and it's makes for an unfunny movie, marked by random points of hilarity. While the cast tries it's best at being funny, the script just will not allow them to be. I feel sorry for them, and I could only wish that the Fox executives spent more time telling the writers how much of a sad rip-off the film was, and how unfunny it was. Maybe then, it would not have left such a rotten smell after leaving theatres.\n\n2.5/10."

Every single line was taken from another movie. Great stuff.\n\nThis is a movie you have got to watch. But it may be better suited for the living room than the theaters. Expect some vulgar humor, but also a lot of great parodies. Those who critique this movie for being too childish, doesn't really get the movie. The whole point of this movie is for it to be a bit childish and vulgar. It's thriving on the American Pie wave. I don't know what people expected when they went to the theater and got disappointed. Cause you should expect some extremely childish jokes from such a movie. It deserves a way better rating than the one it's currently got on IMDb (2.7)."

I watched this at double speed and it couldn't be over fast enough. It's unfunny, unoriginal and the set ups for the jokes are wretched excrement at best. I have seen very few, if any of the films they parody, yet I was able to identify them anyways, it's as if the writers just watched a a bunch of movie commercials and cobbled them together into a script. 100 monkeys sitting at 100 typewriters typing for 10 seconds could have written a better script. I can go on ad infinitum about how bad this movie was but I feel that I have wasted enough energy writing about it. MY GOD THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!! The writers need to be blindfolded, led out to a field, shot, their corpses dismembered and their remains posted at the four corners of Hollywood as a warning to all perspective writers to not write such crap again."

And they got HELL for taking their fat ugly girl to see it. Honestly, I can't think of another reason.\n\nAlyson what's-her-name Band-Camp-Girl is lovely and funny.

There is no such thing as a perfect movie; Someone will always find something wrong with it.\n\nAnyways, people who should watch this movie include teens who found the Scary Movie series funny, as well as persons who have actually seen the films it parodies and are up for a good laugh. - A good (and probably crude) sense of humor is required to enjoy this film.\n\nIt is not the best comedy I have seen, however it is also not as bad as the previous commenter makes it out to be.

I mean, take this for example: A fat lady (Who's obviously wearing a suite) dancing on the streets. Okay, that's not funny. What they did, they kept that joke as many times and many ways as possible until we laughed. They reference all these love movies and not one of them is funny. Tony Cox as Hitch was kinda funny, but that's it. I could keep this review going forever on all these failed jokes. My theater was full when I watched it. Not one person was laughing at it except for these annoying little year 10 kids that had just left school laughing at any joke thrown in their faces. I mean, they were laughing at a cat puppet (Jinxers from Meet The Parents and Meet The Fockers) pooping in a toilet. The only joke me and the audience was Lil Jon playing himself. I've always loved his rap and find his voice hilarious. I actually never even saw that coming. That was a great surprise and a great joke. I normally don't give movies a 2/10, but because of Lil Jon and Tony Cox being KIND OF funny I decided to give it a 2.\n\nThis movie tries to be like Scary Movie 1, 2, 3 and 4 and fails miserably. You see, the random jokes work with Horror movies where as with Date Movies it doesn't work at all. Don't get me wrong, I understood where all the references were.

STOP. This movie is what we want, this movie is what we need, that's why films like these make money, A LOT of money.\n\nIts easily enjoyable, its the best entertainment you can get, and, compared to films such Scary Movie or Epic Movie, its pure brilliance. You always see those easy romantic comedies, and wonder, is that what they call humour? NO, Date Movie is pure humour. If you do not laugh, you give smile a try, its just enjoyable.\n\nDon't try to look serious, say what you want to say, and i will say i do enjoy this movie, its spoofed mime actions, good sound and the songs it brings back..\n\nIf you're not alone, - friends, girlfriend or anybody else, you can't watch Dramas or Documentaries, you need something to keep you awake. I love spoofs, everybody does.\n\nConcerning date movie, it does have a good quality of chosen arts, music and actors. You recognise all the movies and you see the comedy as its suppose to be, the movie like this would have been voted no less than 8/10 years ago, but now..\n\nYou people are bored with junk such as this, however junk is the part of our lives, watch it..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Going into the movie theater I thought \"Date Movie\" was going to be a funny movie with mature humor that was spoofing classic romances. My mistake. This movie was like an immature version of \"Scary Movie\"; believe it, or not. Practically all of the laughs in this movie were centered around body parts or something of that nature. There was hardly a plot and the movie jumped around completely from scene to scene just to include a reenactment of a scene from a movie. Actually, most of the movies they did \"parodies\" of weren't even romantic ones. They were just movies that happened to have some sort of love scene in it at one point or another. As I watched the movie I began to wonder why good, funny actors such as Fred Willard were in such a horrible, awful movie. I don't remember laughing once. Of course, that's excluding the times I laughed AT it and how stupid it was. By the way, I've never seen so many white people trying to be black in this movie either. The directors of this movie were trying way to hard to get a laugh out of people. When I got out of the theater the first thing my brother said to me was, \"I didn't know there could be any movie on the face of this earth that was as bad as that was.\" Yeah. Exactly. Trust me folks, do not waste your money. Go rent \"Scary Movie\" if you really want to see a good movie. Wow, there's a thought."

        "review_detailed_main": "Some parody movies are hilarious due to being well thought out and wonderfully executed. Some parody movies are thrown together haphazardly and are forgotten in ten minutes. This is one of the latter. This is somewhat disheartening, seeing as how \"Date Movie\" had a lot (And I mean a lot) of material to work with. I think I only laughed twice at this film. I won't tell you where because I don't want to spoil it for you, should you decide to see it. This movie wants to show promise, and I WANT to like this movie. The poor editing and even worse acting is what holds it back the most. This movie could have been side-splitting, rolling-in-the-aisles hilarious, but it is so poorly put together that all you will get out of it is a chuckle or two. The \"Kill Bill\" parody is the extreme low point of this film. The parodies are thrown together one after the other, with no cohesion at all. I understand that parodies need not have a masterful storyline; I did not pop in \"Date Movie\" expecting to see \"Citizen Kane\". However, I did not pop in \"Date Movie\" expecting to see a storyline that an episode of \"Boobah\" could put to shame. There is nothing holding this plot together. We run haphazardly from a \"Wedding Planner\" parody to a \"Meet The Fockers\" parody to a \"Kill Bill\" parody right back to \"The Wedding Planner\". This film's lifeblood is poop jokes, cheap laughs at fat people, and misogynistic banter. Don't see it."

I cannot recall one redeeming spoof in this film, it just got worse and worse. I was totally disgusted with this film and everyone in it.\n\nAlso, films like this that are labeled as \"comedies\" that do nothing but \"constantly make fun of people\" are not worth watching anyway. (Don't get me wrong, there IS comedy in making fun of folks if done creatively. This was not done in this film.) It's a lazy form of comedy to me, and this film is beyond lazy - or beyond the use of the celluloid it took to make this."

I'll wait just 2 more minutes.\" ...I kept giving it chances, but every time it abused my generosity. It wasn't even a parody - it was a tasteless comedy. When I go to see a spoof, I do expect a little bit of what you might call \"randomness,\" but that's usually linked to something -- maybe a weakness in the original movie, or even just a part that begs to be played on. It almost has to be something that people can expect, because they noticed the same thing in the original movie...but too different still to make them laugh. It needs to be something other people can laugh at because they understand what the spoof is getting at. On the total opposite side of the spectrum is the movie that connects to other movies without the touch of recognition that makes parodies what they are,..instead Date Movie ended up with a movie full of tasteless humour -- and this is the title Date Movie made for itself in my mind after those 15 torturous minutes."

Where there any writers involve in this? They just throw parts of other movies randomly and they didn't even try to male it funny. I really can't explain what's happening lately with all these Teen Comedies coming out from Hollywood, hardly any of them are worth watching. Last week I watch the Korean teen comedy \"Sex is Zero\" for the second time and it was hilarious, why can't they make a movie like this one?

People from ages 10 to 12 will laugh at this idiotic excuse for a movie, which thankfully is only 83 minutes long. It's a shame, because Alyson Hannigan always seems to make me laugh, and she does make me smile a bit, but not enough to save this film.\n\nThe plot, if you can call it a plot, goes as so: Alyson Hannigan plays an overweight girl who's father (Eddie Griffin....I know, she's white, he's black, and the character's mom is Indian and Greek) wants her to work at the family diner forever. After a Pimp My Ride makeover from Hitch (little actor Tony Cox), she turns into the normal beautiful Hannigan. Now it's off to find love, and Adam Campbell is the best she's got. Only problem is that his ex-fianc\u00e9, Andy (Sophie Monk), wants him too.\n\nThe only thing that keeps 'Date Movie' from getting a '1' is the fact that Sophie Monk and Alyson Hannigan are a lot of fun to look at. The jokes are not funny, even though they include spoofs of 'Wedding Crashers', 'Napoleon Dynamite', That Burger King commercial with Paris Hilton, 'Hitch', MTV's 'Pimp My Ride', and Ben Affleck's love life, the film is still horrible. AVOID AT ALL COSTS IF YOU WANT TO LIVE. Guys, don't take a girl to see this, unless you want her to dump you. It's stupid, pointless, and extremely unfunny. Huge disappointment.\n\n2/10 --spy"

        "review_detailed_main": "Date Movie- Why did they even bother? That's the question I am asking. This is the worst movie I have seen in my life. It is completely crude and tasteless, and it really surprised me that a good actress like Alyson Hannigan would star in this piece of c***. None of the jokes were funny, just ridiculously tasteless or plain unfunny and the spoofs were old and over used. Some of the scenes were particularly distasteful and quite upsetting, really. The whole movie ran along clumsily, not making much sense, changing too fast. And it's meant to be a comedy? Get real. I have never heard of such garbage. The movie is a pile of garbage. I do not know why anyone would bother writing, directing, producing and starring in this movie. It is honestly that bad. If you don't want to be bored and disgusted out of your mind, you shouldn't watch this horrendous piece of s***."

If you liked Scary Movie 1,2,3 and the 4th which is soon to be released i recommend. If you are easily offended i would not recommend it as it has some Jokes, That may easily offend"

        "review_detailed_main": "I went to this movie with my 13 year old son, who even he didn't think it was very funny, and the comedy was obviously geared for male teens. I hoped for parody movie that would be halfway as good as \"Airplane\" or the original \"Hot Shots.\" This movie made those above-average films look like a Hollywood legendary comedy like \"Dr. Stranglove\" or \"It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World.\" To be sure the movie did have a few chuckles, but the comedy was mostly an exercise of crossing the line of crudeness into just embarrassingly bad and just mean. If you find fat jokes ad nauseum and beating up on homeless people hilarious, enjoy. It was one of those movies that you walk in the theater with a premonition that it would suck. I will conclude by saying that it lived up to that expectation....big time."

If you like silly, and stupid movies you would be laughing your head off!! Teens like this much more because the movies they put together in this movie is all the other movies we have watched and liked! This movie is a lot like the scary movie series which all people watch. But this is indeed more funnier I think. I just loved this movie and recommend this to people who need a good laugh."

I got to tell you I have seen all of the chick flicks that are referenced in this movie, and they are all great. Some of my favourite \"chick flicks\" were spoofed in this movie, like \"Pretty Woman\", \"How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days\", \"What Women Want\" and \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\", just to name a few.\n\nAlyson Hannigan & Adam Campbell make a great pair, I loved the two of them in this movie. She was perfect in American Pie, and I thought wow, she's hilarious. Adam Campbell, I've never heard the name before, but I've seen him in a few movies and I like him, he's very funny.\n\nA lot of people weren't very fond of this movie, and I don't know why, was it the worst movie ever, no way, I've seen a lot worse, trust me. Was it the best movie? Not really, I have seen better, however, I didn't hate this movie, I loved it. I thought it was really, really funny. The scene when they parody, \"When Harry Met Sally\" was the most memorable to me, along with a few others.\n\nAll in all, I thought this movie was great, I'm giving it a 6 though, because it's not the best, but it's definitely not the worst."

There are probably 3 minutes of 'good stuff' in this movie and roughly 1/3 of the material might have been usable in talented hands. I still gave this a \"3\", because I've got the hots for Ms. (I hope!) Hannigan.\n\nThe \"writers\" had a few jokes on the subject, just enough for a credible pitch, but in the end no talent or even real enthusiasm to fill it up right. So they did what the \"writers\" of spoofs do today. Have been doing for the past 13 years, starting from \"Fatal Instinct\": steal familiar scenes from movies of the genre and other current movies. Add in a bad joke - or just act it out bad, and PRRRESTO! ...that is, IF the \"writers\" even needed that. They could have just walked up to their buddy at the studio and said \"we wrote Scary Movie, right? Now we gonna write a Date Movie spoof! Cough up the dough, DOG!\"\n\nThe end product is 80 minutes of forced and excessively lengthened scenes, most of them unfunny, just linked together. Did this even look good on paper? Well, if the ZAZ guys are making movies like \"Scary movie 4\" these days, what can you ask for? Obviously NOT a spoof worth the ticket. \"Airplane!\" \"Top Secret!\" \"Naked Gun\"... *sigh*"

The one slightly--SLIGHTLY--bright spot in this otherwise very dark stain on cinema is the performance of Fred Willard spoofing Dustin Hoffman. Otherwise, have your Prozac handy.

Date Movie begins in a decent way with a parody of Napoleon Dynamite and the dance scene which you pretty much see completely in the trailer. That's pretty much all that there's decent comedy in the movie. Otherwise the jokes don't hit the spot or are just plain embarrassing in how stupid they take the audience to be. I have to admit that the cat made me laugh a few times but otherwise it's not worth it.. It's not worth it! I was disappointed I wasted my time although I expected it to be bad.. but not this bad!

Um, I think the other four must have been the real talent, because Date Movie was AWFUL. Without a doubt, THE WORST movie I've ever wasted my time and money on!\n\nThere is nothing else that I can say except that it was a waste of time. You could just go out and rent all of the romantic comedies that it was supposedly parodying and watch them. There was really nothing about this movie that was unique or in any way entertaining... (except maybe when the two characters beat up that bum. That was kind of funny, but if I hadn't laughed at that, I would have nothing to laugh at.)\n\nDate movie contains references and plot thefts from the following movies: Big Fat Greek Wedding, Meet the Parents/Fockers, The Wedding Planner, My Best Friend's Wedding, When Harry Met Sally, Hitch, and I think even Wedding Crashers. Rent all of these movies, they are all GREAT romantic comedies, and are wonderful to watch.\n\nDate Movie, however, cut-and-pasted these films together, stringing in some different forms of vulgarity, and ended up with a choppy, sloppy, ill-directed, poorly written pot of junk. Slap a claim that 2 of the 6 writers from Scary Movie(s) participated, and I fell for it like everyone else who went to see this monstrosity. Do yourself a favor and pretend this was never released, and you will be blissfully ignorant to the horrors encountered while watching Date Movie."

Sure, I'll agree there were a few slow parts where the one-liners weren't flying at one per minute; but overall the movie was a good laugh and had a good message. I'm not sure what the message was exactly, but I'm pretty sure there was one in there somewhere. The satire was thick and popped up frequently. They must have satired thirty movies throughout the show. I know I recognized at least a dozen and I don't watch that many romance or romantic comedy movies. This is definitely one to purchase (as soon as it hits the three for $10 shelf). It belongs right up there with the Scary Movie series and the apple pie movies."

Not to mention her parents (Eddie Griffin and Meera Simhan) are not happy with their daughter's upcoming wedding. While her boyfriend brings Julia and her parents to meet his eccentric-in-laws (Fred Willard and Jennifer Coolidge).\n\nDirected by Aaron Seltzer (Disaster Movie, Epic Movie, Meet the Spatians) made an sporadically funny spoof, based on good or bad romantic comedies. Which some of the best romantic comedies are popular in our recent vintage pop movies. Hannigan, Campbell and especially Monk have their funny moments. But thanks to a poor script, it seems the usually good comedic cast have trouble making this flick amusing, At times, it doesn't seemed... they tired at all. A few hilarious moments but nothing more. Seltzer, who co-wrote the script with Jason Friedberg (Who co-directed the film, who is uncredited) are not even close as The Zucker Brothers, The Farrelly Brothers or even Keenan Ivory Wayans (Which Seltzer and Friedberg worked on \"Scary Movie\").\n\nThe DVD is the Unrated Version of this movie. The DVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen (.185:1) transfer and an fine Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The DVD also includes an poor commentary track by Seltzer and Friedberg, a decent second commentary track with cast members Hannigan, Campbell, Monk, Tony Cox as Hitch and Varely Ortiz as a parody of Jennifer Lopez's big butt. The most amusing commentary is from Los Angeles film critics Scott Foundas and Bob Strauss offers more laughs than the movie. The DVD also includes a laugh track (If you thought the movie was hilarious, it is a matter of personal taste), featurettes, Deleted/Extended Scenes and more. \"Date Movie\" is a OK Spoof to watch at least once. I didn't think much of it, since i watched three years ago. Now watching it again, it was unnecessary (Although i liked it slightly better the second time). But the movie like it or not does have a cult following. If you enjoy spoof comedies, you will find a few laughs, others beware! (** 1/2 out of *****)."

        "review_detailed_main": "Firstly, I would like to say that, as a lot of other people, I had that sinking feeling in my gut even before the movie was released. Why, you ask? Well, I'm not usually a person who gets influenced by reviews a lot, but looking at the comments and score on this site really set me thinking.\n\nSecondly, over here, the movie was rated as 'NC-16', which translates to 'No-Children Under 16'. At first, I was cursing, once again, the wonders of the ratings system, which supposedly prevented precocious and naive young kids such as myself from getting influenced by too many swear words and a whole lot of nudity/\"sexual content\".\n\nAnd so, I come to the main point: For once in my life, I say thank you to the ratings board for rating this piece of ATROCIOUS, DISGUSTING crap as it is. Resorting to watching the movie via another method *whistles*, I was relatively happy at the thought of getting such a gem, as I thought, for free. When the first scene with Napoleon Dynamite appeared, I wasn't sure of what I should do. Laugh? Possibly. I had had a good time watching ND, so it seemed like the safe choice. So, laugh I did, but it was more to make some light out of the situation, especially when he started his 'GOD!' rampage.\n\nBut what is a typical American movie without its gross-out and tasteless moments? When the cat started having sex with the corpse, I felt sick to my very core, and as all of my friends tell anyone, I am a very big sadist and lover of gore and morbidity. I was watching this instead of studying for my examinations, which were the next day. I'll admit: The LOTR scene elicited a laugh or two from me. The Owen Wilson lookalike at the end was also relatively funny, but that's about it for half-decent scenes. If beating up a vagrant is the writers' idea of 'funny', then all of us might as well drill a hole in our heads and were hats on our bottoms right now.\n\nI probably should end this little tirade with a tinge of sympathy for those who paid to watch it. You should probably request your money back, and I should go and make the producers retake my examination for me if I do badly. How about making a movie out of that? We could call it, say, Dead Movie?"

The one thing that made me laugh just a little, was the spoofing of the cat from Meet the parents, where they've taken it about five steps further. I sat through all of it because i always see all of a movie i've paid to rent, no matter how bad it is, but this one really tested me to the limit. Even Allison Hannigan (who i still think of as a good actress) didn't stand any chance of saving it because the script is so embarrassingly dumb, you wouldn't believe it. Save your money for something else or rent it at your own risk. Consider yourself warned!"

        "review_detailed_main": "16 September 2006. There are some great parodies of recent movies including Kill Bill, Something About Mary, and a number of other popular movies. However, it is probably the rather controversial and perhaps ill-advised, politically incorrect depiction of fatness (unlike Shallow Hal) at the very beginning of this film that turned a good portion of the audience elsewhere. In terms of a consistent and common thread throughout this movie, it adhered to the spirit of parody with good use of playing on stereotype, on a mostly high level without the extreme-outrageous use of weird. Sometimes erratic, the movie still manages to reveal wit in its intelligent use of script comedy than grossness. Six out of Ten Stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "Date Movie is the kind of piece of garbage that makes Scary Movie 4 look like intelligent satire. It's the kind of movie that makes Fatal Instict seem like it's actually worth remembering. And it's the kind of movie that makes Airplane look like freakin' Gone With the Wind.\n\nIt doesn't really poke fun at the genre of \"date movies\" as much as it plainly and simply emulates popular movies from the past few years and succeeds brilliantly in making them less funny, more stupid, and disgusting. There's a scene in Meet the Parents where Greg Focker opens a bottle of champagne and accidentally knocks over an urn which holds the remains of Jack Brynes' mother. The Byrnes' family pet, a cat named Mr. Jinx, pees on the ashes that are scattered on the floor. So how can Date Movie top this? For one thing, the character in Greg's place now has the surname \"Fockyerdaughter.\" And instead of ashes, the entire decayed body falls out. The cat has sex with it. Fantastic.\n\nThat is just one example out of a sadly large, large number of scenes that are just as bad and even worse. Years from now, film scholars could go through this movie scene by scene and lecture on just how terrible it is.\n\nThe jokes are bad, most run too long and become not only unfunny, but genuinely irritating. It's clear that the makers of Date Movie are just cashing in on popular movies by mixing them together. The upcoming release of Epic Movie is further proof of this.\n\nI think I laughed once during the movie. It was when Alyson Hannigan is dancing in her fat suit at the beginning: a construction worker nails himself in the head with a nail gun so he can save himself from having to see her dance. In hindsight, I should have done the same and saved myself from watching this terrible, terrible excuse for a movie.\n\nMy rating: 1/10"

This movie should be yanked off the shelves before any more people wasted 80 minutes of their lives watching this. I will be left baffled at how some of these great actors, and so many of them, would be willing to do movies like these. The movie started off OK but just took a downward spiral thereafter.

What i really don't understand (as in the comment above) is why all of these great actors actually agreed to be in the movie. If I had read the script before I saw the movie, unaware about the actors, I would have expected actors that no one ever heard heard of. When I watched it I laughed a lot in the beginning where the story actually were good, but later on it was to much. My recommendation: Don't spend money buying or renting this movie, watching the American Pie for the tenth time will be more fun than this"

The film has no sense of high-brow comedy that can be expected from a parody or satire. It even lacks the quick pacing of a farce. It is slow and droll, and the constant repetition of rap/r&b music for laughs is so see through. \"Look, how funny!! Two stuffy white people speaking the lyrics of 'Candy Shop' by Fitty Cent!\" ... err... not funny at all.\n\nFilm could have been easily been more high brow and layered but it was stupid, low-brow comedy (and even lowbrow comedy can be appreciated sometimes, but not when its as in-your-face and repetitious as this.)

Stick with Not Another Teen Movie or the Scary Movie franchise.

        "review_title": "I think this movie broke the world record for the most jokes to fall flat on their face, gathering no laughter.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Before reading, please note that this review reveals a few plot details and jokes in the movie.\n\nSpoof movies aren't really common enough today, so whenever I see a trailer for one, I am immediately enthusiastic for it. Date Movie was no different- I thought it was about time somebody made fun of Romantic movies, and I was really ready for a movie to put the hammer to the Napoleon Dynamite craze- I thought this movie would probably do these things perfectly, and rank right up there with the original Scary Movie... For the most part, I was dead wrong.\n\nDate Movie tries so desperately hard to generate laughs- it seems that jokes happens constantly. The problem is that most of these are not really jokes, because they are not funny. Most of the jokes are lame and immature, things that my buddies and I could've thought of in Seventh grade. For those of you who have moved on since Jr. High, I think its safe to say that watching an hour and a half of this stuff is would not turn out to be a good time. From the point where you watch \"Jinxers\" take a nice, 2 minute dump (seriously, the scene is like two minutes of a cat sitting on a toilet farting), till you see the Paris Hilton clone rubbing a cheeseburger in her cleavage, you'll know that this is immature comedy- and probably at its worst.\n\nIf you're expecting a mind blowing story, I don't know why you're considering to watch a spoof movie. However, this is really bad, even for its genre. Usually a Spoofs storyline can at least be enjoyable. Not Date Movie's! This really doesn't even seem to have a storyline, just a little path it follows while it bombards you with jokes. For what little there is, you can tell that the movie is basically about a girl named Julia (Hannigan) who is struggling with her love life until she gets \"pimped\" (one of the funnier parts of the movie) and meets the man of her dreams, Grant. (I can't think of his name, and I don't want to look it up- He sucked.) throughout the movie you see them going throug their relationship, meeting each others parents, that sort of thing. Then Grants ex girlfriend (Sophie Monk) butts into the relationship, and other stuff happens... as you can tell, not a whole lot of thought put into the storyline, they didn't really even attempt to make the storyline itself funny. Perhaps the whole point of a crappy storyline was to illustrate how terrible most romantic films storyline's are- doubtful, but it would make sense I guess.\n\nThe acting in this movie was pretty bad too- Alyson Hannigan does a decent job as the main character, and Eddie Griffen (who seems to be the bright spot in a whole lot of crappy movies) is pretty funny, but his role isn't big enough to give the movie a bit of a boost. Other than that, every other actor in the movie seemed to do a pretty crappy job, although I liked the spoofs of J-Lo and Barbara Streisand's Meet the Focker's character. Oh, and to Josh Myers, I've seen 8 year olds do better Napoleon Dynamite impersonations. Give me a break man.\n\nNow onto the part of the review that looks on the bright-side of the movie (also known as the short part.) A few jokes are pretty hilarious once you wade through the onslaught of crap the movie throws at you. I'll admit that I was laughing my head off during the Michael Jackson part, and a lot of the Meet the Parents/Focker's scenes were good, but perhaps a little too gross. The movie doesn't start out terribly either, but after the Meet the Fockers part, the movie starts getting boring and sort of drags its heels the rest of the way.\n\nIn conclusion, for a movie that makes fun of everything from Bridget Jones Diary to Hungry Man TV Dinners, Date movie was a disappointment, and just not very good. I first watched this movie with two of my friends, and we laughed quite a bit, but for each laugh there seemed to be 3 or 4 groans of disgust at a stupid part. This movie probably isn't worth seeing at all, but if you see it on TV one day and you're really, really bored, you might not have such a bad time. But I don't recommend spending money to watch just it, the movie is just not good enough to trigger the use of your wallet."

The best part of the film i have to say though is the credits. i watched it in my local cinema and it was rated 12a so all the way through kids where asking there parents what the jokes meant. they should have put more grown up jokes in and raised the viewing certificate. to sum it up this movie is a flop and once released on DVD it will soon be in the bargain bin at your local gas station."

I haven't been insulted in a LONG time by fat jokes, but the fat jokes just kept coming one after another. 30 seconds after laughing about a \"Pimp My Ride\" spoof, I was getting up to leave. My boyfriend was shocked that I was so offended, but he had no argument on leaving. This movie has a few laughs, but at the expense of innocent overweight people.\n\nIt's pretty sad that the people that participated in the making of this movie had to target the new majority of the US for their humor. I am so happy that I didn't pay for these tickets. And even though I didn't finish it, I doubt my curiosity will get the best of me when it comes out on video. I haven't been so offended since middle school fat jokes, which, in my opinion, were funnier."

It's not like they were working against a deadline was it? Then there's no excuse, whoever wrote this crap should never work in movies again! Like Bloodrayne, I only gave this movie a 3/10 because of what it COULD have been, not for what it is.\n\nThe parodies were very poorly thought out and executed even worse. Heck, I alone could probably think of better, funnier, and more entertaining parodies of all the movies they spoofed within a month.\n\nBecause of the horrible reviews from the poor souls who saw it after it was released, I refrained from going to the theater to see this.\n\nI rented it thinking \"how bad could it be, I love parodies.\" I found out.\n\nThe trailer did an excellent job of making this movie look good, so i must give the promoters credit! Just watch the trailers over and over again and skip this movie unless you can rent it for no additional charge. Otherwise wait till it comes out on cable/satellite."

        "review_detailed_main": "Seriously one of the worst movies made in a while. If this thing was supposed to be somewhat of a chick-flick parody of movies like Scary Movie has to do with scary movies, (that probably didn't make sense), they failed miserably. The director should punched himself in the face and rethink ALL his decisions about this movie. The acting was bad, the jokes not funny,( and sometimes disgusting, the pimple scene for instance),and everything was just unaganized. A bad movie overall and not one to take your date to, go to another one or spend your hard earned cash on another comedy like Talledaga Nights or something. A most disturbing 1/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "There was a guy on the Message Board, who asked the other users, which movie he should see: this one or Walk the Line. This is the easiest question I've ever seen in my life. I haven't seen Walk the Line yet, but I plan to, and I know that it's in no way can be as bad as Date Movie.\n\nSeriously: if you have a decent taste in comedies, you will loathe this garbage from your heart. It just repeats scenes from well known movies, and adds absolutely nothing to them; or trying to spoof a movie, and goes totally the worst way you can ever possibly imagine. This is the case with the LotR \"spoof\". Whoever came up with that idea, should be casted away to Mordor. Enough said.\n\nThere's no plot. There's no acting, there is no dialogue. There is no movie. What am I talking about? This movie has never been made. I'm not wasting any more words for it. Worst comedy ever. Period.\n\nThe only way you can make an even worse film is to spoof this movie. That would be 10000 times more horrible than this torture, but we would finally have a reason to drag the creators of that movie to the street and shoot them in front of a cheering crowd.\n\n1/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The problem with \"Date Movie\" is not that it spoofs too many movies, nor that it spoofs too few. The problem is really that instead of making fun of the films it's \"spoofing,\" \"Date Movie\" simply takes scenes from other movies and adds them in it random times, using its own characters. For instance, the leading man and leading lady have a moment where they exchange lines from a variety of romantic comedies, but they don't actually poke fun at any of them. They basically copied and pasted random moments from the other movies.\n\nThe main plot is not worth mentioning, except for that it is a spoof of mainly \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" and \"Meet the Fockers.\" The film does poke fun at the former, but the latter is already so ridiculous that \"Date Movie\" simply steals its jokes. Among the other films copied and pasted are \"Jerry Maguire\", \"Say Anything\", \"Kill Bill: Volume Two\", \"My Best Friend's Wedding\", and \"King Kong (???)\".\n\nI'm not giving this film a 1 because, I have to admit, I saw this film with a few friends and we did laugh out loud a lot, until we recognized that it was too long and too stupid to waste our time on.\n\n3/10 PS: Carmen Electra is in the film for about two minutes, and she gives one of the worst performances I have ever seen! She deserved that Razzie!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Should you pick out a date to go to your nearby multiplex cinema and spend $9.00 on the comedy farce \"Date Movie\"? Hell No! You will be stood-up! However, should you wait the shortened window period until it is released on DVD? Why Not? As many dates that we go on, only if you do not have anything else to do. In the spirit of the \"Scary Movie\" franchise, \"Date Movie\" is a farce mockery of the romantic-comedy genre including such films as: \"When Harry Met Sally\", \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\", \"Shallow Hal\", \"Meet The Parents\", and \"The Wedding Planner\". Alyson Hannigan, the band camp girl of \"American Pie\", stars in the film but should as we speak be saying phrases like \"One time at acting camp, my agent told me to star in this silly film called Date Movie and now my career is over\". Actually, she was not entirely bad but she was asphyxiated with too many shabby scenes. However, my \"guilty pleasure\" zone was turned on with the Michael Jackson and the The Fockers farces. I was laughing my ass off! \"Date Movie\" is not too different then a date in itself: It will make you easily laugh at times , but it will more easily make you cry when you realize that you did not get what you really wanted! *** Average"

In fact the producer, the director, & the whole cast needs whacked. This movie franchise, that was created by the Wayans brothers, has gone completely down hill. It's no wonder that they left after Sacry Movie 2. Please stop with the ________ Movie franchise because it has gotten to the point that if the Wayans do come back, they can't save it. Look, I am sick of this franchise. It has gotten cheap & out of control. I didn't make it through 20 minutes of this movie & I asked for a stop to it. The part with the parody of Pimp My Ride & Meet the Parents was enough to make me think, \"Why the f%@* am I watching this\", to make my stomach cry for help & make my grandfather turn in his grave 2,000,000 times, all in 20 minutes. Just please stop."
