        "review_detailed_main": "Mike Myers is a talented guy, but this vehicle is an embarrassment. The funniest parts are gleefully juvenile, but they are, unfortunately, outnumbered by gags that are simply juvenile or, worse yet, juvenile and mean-spirited. For example, some of the jokes directed at Verne Troyer's character sound like they were uttered by a 15-year-old classroom bully, not written by an intelligent man in his forties. I'm all in favor of offending PC sensibilities whenever possible, but do it right: cracks about Keebler elves show are just stupid and artistically lazy.\n\nMore scenes of young Pitka might have explained better how he grew into the adult he became, and Rajneesh could have been fleshed out a bit. I suspect that a lot of character development and back story were left on the cutting room floor. What should have been cut were the cameos that were either pointless or self-referential without being truly funny.\n\nThe plot wasn't exactly Citizen Kane quality, but it could have worked with better writing. After all, if anything cries out for satiric treatment, it's the self-help and New Age movements. With such target-rich subject matter, how did Myers manage to make such a dud? I think that it's a case of plain self-indulgence. Jim Carrey and Robin Williams are two other talented, over-the-top funny men who do some of their best work when they show restraint and don't play themselves. Someone should have reined in Myers on this one.\n\nFor his penance, I suggest that he lay off comedy for a while and do a few dramatic roles - including supporting ones - as he did (quite well) in \"54.\" Williams and Carrey have shown other dimensions of themselves in dramatic roles, and I'm sure Myers can, too."

And I understand if fans of Mike Myers will still go to see this film. I did after all, even after reading the terrible reviews. Sadly, this time, the critics were correct. Mike knows better. The director should've known better. Mike Myers's return to live action comedy is more than disappointing. Even the character, Your Holiness the Guru Pitka, was unlikeable (which is a first for a Mike Myers character). He was so full of himself, so damn selfish, no one cared if he succeeded. His giggle-fits were too common to spark a slight giggle from the audience. And although the women in the film were pure eye-candy (Jessica Alba, Meagan Good, even Mariska Hargitay and Jessica Simpson made cameos), they became little more than that with such a flat script. Sorry Mike. Maybe next time. A fourth Austin Powers would be quite a way to get back in the game with your biggest fans:)"

Mike Myers has lost the charm he exhibited in the Austin Powers franchise. And it's clear that he picked an inexperienced director for this so he could control the shoot. And why does Jessica Alba keep doing crappy movies like this and \"Good Luck, Chuck\"? Did someone tell her she was a comedienne? And Justin Timberlake -- well, no wonder he wears a wig and moustache throughout. Ironically, though the material is definitely for teen-aged boys, they probably won't go to see it because of the title. It'll maybe have one weekend, then go flaccid. Incidentally, the only truly memorable line in the entire mess is from Verne Troyer in an outtake run with the credits. But it's not worth watching the entire mess to hear it."

For every joke that's funny (which are few) there is about dozen that are not. Then there's all the jokes we've seen in previous Myers films that aren't so funny the 4th time around when they appear in this flick. Many moments in this film will having you looking around the theater wondering if anyone else finds this movie as stupid as you do.\n\nThat's really the bottom line. This movie is stupid. Take every fear you've had watching the trailer, times it by 10 and you will get an idea of how bad this film is.\n\nBy the way, the hockey in this movie will leave any one who loves the game sick to there stomach. The hockey portrayal left me in tears. Its brutal ! The film is a HUGE slap in the face to hockey. Thanks Mike Myers !\n\nOn a positive note though, Justin Timberlake and Stephen Colbert are hilarious. The only time i enjoyed the movie at all was when they were on screen. I never thought in a million years I would leave a movie saying \" Thank God Justin Timberlake was is it.\"\n\nIn short : this movie is terrible ! Don't believe me ?

        "review_title": "Bad karma or just bad movie-making? The Love Guru is a contender for worst film ever made",
        "review_detailed_main": "I don't throw this statement around lightly. As someone who frequently reads reviews, I find that it is thrown around far too often, especially when there are so many bad movies out there. But I can say, without a doubt in my mind, that The Love Guru is the worst movie I've ever seen. It has officially dethroned classics such as Die Hard Dracula and Dark Harvest 2: The Maize. Those movies were made on minuscule budgets by no-talents. In comparison, The Love Guru was made on a huge budget by Mike Meyers, the creator of comedy classics Austin Powers and Wayne's World, which makes this train wreck of a film all the more painful to watch.\n\nWith The Love Guru, you can tell Meyers is trying to create another success along the lines of Austin Powers, but failing miserably. The thing about Austin Powers was despite being a dumb comedy, the movie had a likable, fun protagonist. In Meyer's latest outing, we get the Guru Pitka, a Charles Manson look-alike who has an obsession with penises. It's somewhat fitting that he resembles Charles Manson, a notorious cult leader, as by the movies end I had a strange urge to kill myself. Not only is the Guru creepy, he's also very unfunny. Whether he's making lame puns about \"life\" or talking about penises, he never manages to elicit any laughs whatsoever. It could be that his jokes are just bad. Certainly using jokes straight out of a children's joke book isn't a recipe for success. It could also be the fact that Meyers is so desperate for a laugh, he himself laughs at every joke and continuously looks at the audience, attempting to entice them to laugh along with him. You get the sense that he realizes the jokes are unfunny and the glances at the audience are his last failed attempts at getting a few laughs. Guru Pitka's character development just adds injury to the insult. One minute Pitka is being hailed as a spiritual healer who lives to help people and the next minute he's insulting a midget for no particular reason. There's no consistency to the character at all, which is what this movie is missing in comparison to Meyer's last few. Wayne Campbell and Austin Powers felt like real characters, where the Guru doesn't really have any character; he randomly does whatever moves the plot along forward.\n\nSpeaking of plot, the storyline is almost as ill-conceived as the title character. A stupid plot in a comedy is acceptable if it manages to be funny, but there's nothing amusing about a Guru's quest to go on the Oprah show. That's just plain stupid. It would help if the film wasn't filled with every clich\u00e9 ever known to cinema-goers, but it is. The Guru has a self-revelation at the end and changes his greedy ways. The good guys triumph. And of course, Blur's \"Song 2\" plays during one of the hockey sequences, which has become the most commonly used (and groan-inducing) tune for any sports-related film.\n\nEven if you can put aside the annoyingness of the Guru Pitka, the movie still fails to deliver anything remotely funny. The most common joke is to have a characters name resemble something vulgar, such as \"Dick Pants\" or some other Grade 3 level joke. The next most common is the Guru's constant repeating of \"TM\" after one of his catchphrases. It wasn't funny the first time, what made Meyers think it would be funny the tenth or fifteenth? There's also the repetition of jokes from Austin Powers, ranging from the plane to even the casting of Verne Troyer, the midget who made one of his only popular appearances in the Powers films as Mini-Me. Finally, there are the gags that are just plain lame. These involve elephants humping each other, the Guru wearing a chastity belt, the Guru having a battle using mops soaked in urine, the Guru sticking his head up his own ass (which is actually far less funny than it sounds), the Guru getting punched in the groin, the Guru doing battle with a rooster and the Guru engaging in two very long song and dance numbers on the Sitar, one a rendition of Dolly Parton's \"9 to 5\", the other a ear-splitting variation on \"Space Cowboy\" by Steve Miller Band. Both are in there for no particular reason whatsoever (and I really do hope it wasn't for laughs).\n\nThe other actors are fairly bad, although they really don't have much to work with. Jessica Alba continues her tradition of playing practically the same exact character, giggling and acting ditsy. Justin Timberlake is atrocious as Jacque Grande, although to be fair, his character was a one-note joke about Quebecois people. I'm bemused that Meyers would think Americans would find a joke about a people they likely know little about funny, especially when I didn't find it funny and I'm a Canadian. Verne Troyer just proves that the only reason he has even a semblance of a career is because of the novelty that he's a midget.\n\nIt really is hard to describe how utterly bad The Love Guru is. It's a stupid comedy, yes, but I'm a fan of those. I'm the guy who gave You Don't Mess With the Zohan a positive rating, so if anything this should be right up my alley. Instead, it's the worst movie of the year for sure (leaving Meet the Spartans way behind in its dust) and has reached it's place, for me at least, as the worst movie ever created. It's painfully unfunny and left me in a sour mood for a good hour after viewing. I'd rather wear a chastity belt for 30 years like the Guru rather than sit through this pile of crud."

Now I'm convinced that Mike must have some obsession with the penis, because there are so many penis jokes in this movie it just becomes painfully unfunny. Now there was a decent audience in the movie theater, like twenty something people, I did not hear one laugh, seriously, I even kept sighing, wondering when this movie was going to be over. Five people left early complaining, I wished I had joined them, but something inside me was just hoping that something would make me laugh, I was really pulling for Mike, but he has just made me so unhappy with this bad movie that was just his pathetic attempt of constantly reminding people of his good comedic days.\n\nGuru Pitka is a self help guru who is very successful, but he is ranked as the number two self help guru of the world. The only way he feels like he can be successful is to be on Oprah. So he has to save a man, Darran, on a loosing hockey team in Canada to get him back with his ex girlfriend who is with this \"cocky\" winning goalie, Jacques Grande.

Now, I hate it when people call movies racist without even thinking what the movie is supposed to be, but you know what?! I was friggin' offended by this movie, it was just plan sad, Mike Myers has lost his game and cannot admit it. He should have just stuck to the animated voices, because his characters now are just lame. There is nothing I could say more than please just stay away from this film, I know I said this before, but this is just a painful and unfunny movie. Good luck to Mike Myers, he'll need it big time after more critics review this bad movie.\n\n1/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm glad I wasn't in the UK's Celebrity Big Brother House this year. Not because I wouldn't have enjoyed meeting some of the others, but because at one stage fellow house mate Verne Troyer might have asked me about the last film he did with his best friend, and I wouldn't be comfortable lying to him and denying that I thought The Love Guru was a cinematic mutant mistakenly allowed to live and breathe rather than be put to a merciful sleep in the development stage.\n\nHey, I like Mike Myers. He has a measure of talent and charisma and likability, and I applaud his deserved financial and critical success with the Wayne's World and Austin Powers films (though he went one movie too far with Goldmember). Having said that, Myers, like his fellow SNL alumnus Will Ferrell, is like a kid wandering about a shop eating food off the shelves and generally behaving like someone in desperate need of supervision and guidance. Let's be honest, Ferrell's last decent leading role was in Anchorman (2004), and while he's been fine in supporting work like The Producers (2005), everything else that he's had a hand in has been a series of embarrassments of varying levels. And sadly, Myers can too easily fall into the same degree of arrested development.\n\nPeople who know me know that I may go on about a lot of bad movies, but more often than not, I enjoyed watching them, and perversely can watch them again. This one, however, I'm ashamed that I ever wasted bandwidth getting it, let alone consider watching it again.\n\nMyers' characters have always been one-note, with a limited appeal. But his latest Guru Pitka went too far when he thought of writing it down; in comparison, his Beatnik poet Charlie from So I Married An Axe Murderer (1993) was a character of multi-layered nuance, and more importantly, one that people would much rather watch. The very concept should have been seen as potentially execrable and insulting to Hindus. Yes, I know he tries to get around this in the movie by claiming that Pitka wasn't really a Hindu, but an American raised by Hindus, but like so much else in this movie, that attempt fails miserably given what passes for humor.\n\nHey, I like Dumb Humor \u0096 when it's done right. Dodgeball, Epic Movie, Jay and Silent Bob. But the gags in The Love Guru come in three flavors: racist, gross and infantile, and in various mixtures thereof. The racist names he came up with (Harenmahkeester, Satchabigknoba) is the sort of thing an ignorant ten-year-old kid would come up with to make the other ignorant ten-year-old kids in the playground laugh. Yes, isn't it hilarious that Indian people all have big long names? The rest of the atrocity is filled with other dodgy names like Coach Cherkov and Dick Pants, as well as alleged jokes about snot balls and nose hairs, humping elephants, food prepared to look like genitals, and buckets of urine \u0096 all of which probably would have sounded funny in 1988 in the writers' brainstorming sessions in the SNL offices at 3am when you're doped up on caffeine, but I honestly can't believe that a 45-year-old man wrote this crap down in 2008 and thought this would be funny in any other circumstances.\n\nAnd the execution of these so-called gags is almost consistently accompanied by Myers with the same sort of mugging grin to the camera that he perfected with Wayne Campbell and Austin Powers \u0096 the difference here being that those other characters had moments where they really were humorous, but seeing Myers try it with Pitka is akin to watching an inept magician fail every trick, but still take a rehearsed bow after each one, oblivious to the negative reaction he's getting from his audience. And worse, he drives the jokes so deep into the ground, again and again, you expect them to bump into Hilary Swank piloting her subterranean machine around the Earth's Core.\n\nAnd the storyline carrying these non-gags, like the sores on the back of a leper, is just as awful: a guru seeking fame and a spot on Oprah counsels a Canadian hockey player who wants to win back his wife from a rival, Jacques \"Le Coq\" Grande, who apparently is well-endowed (Get it? Le Coq Grande?). Another lesson to learn, Mike: Sports Themes Aren't Funny. Canadian Sports Themes Aren't Funny, Cubed. It may give you the chance to hang about with your heroes, but it's a waste of time for the rest of us. Some have tried to point out the satire in Pitka's self-help philosophies, but satire only works when it makes a point, and doesn't just appear indistinguishable from the targets it's allegedly satirizing.\n\nIn case I haven't made it clear, this is a Bad Film. Not So Bad It's Good, like The Oxford Murders (2008). This is embarrassing on levels I haven't seen in ages. Some bad movies have people in it who can rise above the mediocrity, but this one is like quicksand, sucking people down and suffocating them. And I'm not talking about the likes of Verne Troyer, Jessica Alba and Justin Timberlake, who were basically employees who probably needed the money, or the cameos from Oprah and Val Kilmer. I'm talking about Ben F**king Kingsley.\n\nHow does a respected Oscar winner go from playing Gandhi to playing Guru Tugginmypudha?"

        "review_detailed_main": "I can see this movie is being murdered by reviewers on this board. Well, I'll give you my point of view on the film that I saw last night. Going in with low expectations, I actually found myself laughing VERY hard at certain parts of the film.\n\nSure, most of the humor is stolen straight out of the Austin Powers series, but it's still funny. The performances by Mike Myers, Justin Timberlake, and Verne Troyer are hilarious. Mike Myers is great as always and Timberlake is surprisingly very funny. The interaction between Myers and Troyer (stolen straight from AP) is absolutely hilarious.\n\nIf you're looking for a deep, thought-provoking movie, you're going to be sadly disappointed. But if you can't tell that from the preview, then maybe you should get your head checked out. The movie is all about \"moments\" and plays out like a long SNL sketch. If you can leave your mind at the door and accept the toilet humor, you might find yourself enjoying it.\n\nMost people reviewing the film 1/10 have probably not even bothered to see it. Others are coming on the board and marking high ratings as \"not useful\" and lower ratings as \"useful\". I will bet money that many people find review \"not useful\" by just looking at the 7 stars I gave it. There are many people just destined to see this movie fail because they think it looks stupid. See the movie for yourself and don't allow others who haven't even SEEN the film tell you that it's awful."

It is filled with juvenile, pubescent humor and had my wife, 10-year old son, and me laughing the whole way through.\n\nThe movie is standard Hollywood formula, but they do it to perfection. Mike Meyers was right smack in his comfort zone. Ben Kingsley and Justin Timberlake were fantastically raucous. And Jessica Alba was.... well Jessica Alba was incredibly HOT! I absolutely recommend this movie to anyone wanting a light-hearted, albeit corny trip to the movies. There was a lot of sexual innuendo, but if you are sheltering your children from what awaits them in the real world, you are destined to be a young grandparent.\n\nThe Burke's give this movie to thumbs up."

Is it possible that a once talented showman became so suicidal that he managed to talk people into giving him 60 million dollars so he could make this career-ender? Masochism is a multi-layered thing. This movie is one long puerile penis joke. What was funny in the context of trailer park losers Wayne and Garth twenty years ago has become an insult to the public. Myers is nearly 50 years old, for heaven's sake, and the best he can come up with is two elephants copulating on the ice in game 7 of the Stanley Cup? Are people that venal to star in this POS? I understand Jessica Alba, like who knew it would be this bad, but the others? There's no excuse to compromise other people's careers if Myers has a death wish, which he apparently does. Penis jokes, testicle jokes, scrotum jokes, ass jokes, it's all too much. Not to mention racist, an insult to Indians, to Maple Leaf fans, to short people, to Jessica Alba fans, to everyone. I guess this is also a tribute to the Hollywood system, where Myers' inflated ego on the basis of the Shrek cash cow can actually convince real human beings to give him a gadzillion dollars. I won't even mention the starving Africans and Indians who could have used the money, it's an insult to them. Hell, building a sewage treatment plant with this money would have done humanity a major favour. Didn't anyone have the courage somewhere along the line to tell Myers to reign it in, to hire a decent scriptwriter if he no longer has it, or just perhaps to rest on his Shrek laurels and play golf? What's really disturbing isn't that this isn't funny (most things aren't), but that it's really mean-spirited. The only redeeming features are Justin Timberlake (who knew?) and a Verne Troyer outtake over the credits. The other 89 and a half minutes should be consigned to Heaven's Gate hell, and Myers should apologise to everyone involved."

        "review_detailed_main": "Years after losing his parents and being taken in by Hindu gurus, Guru Maurice Pitka (Mike Myers), now known as The Love Guru, is now a successful self help mentor operating out of his Ashram in Hollywood. Pitka is approached by Toronto Maple Leafs owner Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba) whose star player Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco) has lost all confidence in himself after leaving his wife Prudence (Meagan Good) to sleep around with models only for Prudence to end up with Jacques \"Le Coq\" Grand\u00e9 (Justin Timberlake) known for his well endowed manhood. Pitka immediately accepts the task with his publicist Dick Pants (John Oliver) informing him the success will be enough to get him an appearance on Oprah and overtake his rival Deepak Chopra (himself) and move from #2 Guru to #1.\n\nThe Love Guru was a major passion project for Mike Myers. Spawned from coping with the loss of his father to Alzheimer's in the early 90s, Myers eventually found solace in the writings of Deepak Chopra and eventually struck up a friendship the two still maintain as well as creating a rough version of what would become Guru Pitka. The Love Guru was Myers first time headlining a live-action feature film since 2003's critical and commercial flop The Cat in the Hat, and due to Myers' behavior, which had been charitably describe as \"Prima Donna\", Myers filmography was rather quiet save for his Shrek contributions in the intervening years between Cat and Guru. In an interview with Colider prior to the film's release, Myers hoped to use the film's farcical nature as a way of conveying some of the teachings and wisdoms he himself had taken from Chopra, but upon release the film became the subject of critical derision and a massive financial flop recouping only $40 million of its $62 million budget. The film remains a black mark on Myers filmography and he hasn't headlined a film since only going for more Shrek voiceovers and supporting character work in films such as Inglorious Basterds, Bohemian Rhapsody, and a few documentaries. While Myers still enjoys fond reminiscence for his work in Wayne's World, Austin Powers, and Shrek, The Love Guru has definitely not endured itself like Myers other work.\n\nThe character of Guru Maurice Pitka is just awful, while supposedly a guru who helps people get in touch with their \"best selves\", he's immature, lives an extravagant lifestyle, makes derogatory statements about homosexuals and little people, and has a really creepy leering approach to women that's frankly rather off putting. Pitka also often laughs and claps at his own jokes (much the same way Myers did in Cat in the Hat) and this approach is annoying because it smothers the few decent gags in the film that raise a snicker, only for the gags to be brought back again, and again, and again to diminishing returns to the point it makes you resent the initially gag. And when the movie isn't beating its few \"okay, kinda clever\" jokes to death with a blunt instrument, it goes for low aiming gags related to Little Person Maple Leafs coach Punch Cherkov as played by Verne Troyer who is basically forced to recycle most of the Mini Me gags from Austin Powers, multiple instances of hackneyed gross out and penis references, and trying to copy the humorous cameos from the Austin Powers films without actually having the cameos needed so we have the likes of late era Val Kilmer and Jessica Simpson while larger scale celebrity's who most likely said no such as Morgan Freeman, Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, and Oprah are represented through either poor photoshops or so-so voice impersonators.\n\nThe rest of the characters aren't that great either. Jessica Alba's still playing the underwritten overly sexualized love interest (down to the fact the gag of a lesbian experience is taken from a similar role she had in the Dane Cook vehicle Good Luck Chuck), Romany Malco's Darren is a womanizing poser who is now feeling emasculated because the wife whom HE divorced is now with a man with a bigger penis, and Pitka's just a fame hungry attention junkie so there's no one to root for despite the movie wanting us to take some of the lessons of Guru Pitka seriously but when the characters are this unlikable and irritating the lessons on personal fulfillment are just suffocated.\n\nThe Love Guru is the inevitable end result of when someone starts to buy into their own Halo effect and isn't told \"no\". While from interviews with Myers there was an attempt to try and make something of humorous and spiritual value, Myers has clearly gone full speed ahead without taking the time to ask for second opinions or refinement of the material leading to a reprehensible lead character and an obnoxious film that lingers on gags set ups way longer than it should and periodically brings them back for second or even third helpings. I don't want this to be the last film Myers headlines because Myers is a talented comedian and actor, but assuming he does try to stage a comeback he should probably have a co-writer or director on hand to tell him \"no\"."

I like when I go see a movie and expect something bad and come out pleasantly surprised and the love guru did just that. The intro took me by surprise with great jokes from mike. The rest of the movie was a fun ride filled with humorous names and puns and cameos from many many comedians and artists and actors. I was very amused by stephen colbert and jim gaffigan's (another great stand up comedian) sports newscasting, hilarious. If anybody gets a chance to see an early screening you should def go, if not then go when it officially is released.,"

It almost made those rubbish Troma movies appear amusing, or at least on a par. On a par, in this case, with the belated 'comeback' effort of a formerly successful and well-liked comedy writer-director-actor whose career had bloomed in the 1990s and floundered in the 2000s. After revisiting his most successful creation (1960s spy-spoof 'Austin Powers') with a third trip to the well in 2002, Myers' live-action movie career stumbled with definitive misfire 'The Cat In The Hat' in 2003. For the next five years Myers remained off-screen, voicing the title character of the animated 'Shrek' movie franchise, until...'The Love Guru'. The movie's many faults are detailed by other posters, but what struck me was how truly sad an experience it was. A genuinely heart-sinking experience akin to watching an old dog trying to jump the fence one time too many. Myers' sense of comedy has gone seriously -and perhaps permanently- adrift, and he has effectively taken a mildly diverting two-minute TV show sketch and stretched it to micron-thinness over a motion picture frame. Look, shall we just do both Mike Myers and ourselves a favour and remember him as he was; i.e. cute and funny? This sad, sobering movie is like a chapter from 'Hollywood Babylon'."

Continuously repeating jokes about people's names is not funny, and it's being incredibly gracious to allow that it EVER was. What saddens me most is the reek of missed opportunity \u0096 lampooning new-age spirituality has seemingly endless comic potential, and yet nothing but the absolute bare bones are mined here. There's little attempt to work the gags into any sort of structure; they're just tossed away, and most of them can be heard to drop with a resounding thud.\n\nThe same ramshackle approach applies to the main character, too; there appears to be little consistency or definable personality about Pitka, the one constant being that he dresses weird and has a beard\u0085 (That rhyme is so lame I confess a slight sense of surprise that Myers didn't add that into the mix, too\u0085 )\n\nOn this evidence, maybe Myers is doing the right thing by hawking himself out for other people's scripts with his forthcoming efforts. It appears any ingenuity or inspiration he once possessed was sapped away long ago"

I just wanted to make sure at least one real comment exists about the movie. He passes through quite a few simple ideas that most grown ups have forgotten a fairly long while ago - in an original way. He intended his character to be overly self-absorbed. For the exact reasons of the message - most of you people are like that! Just get it already. People like Mike do this their whole life hoping to reach a small proportion of you - the ones writing the comment are not in that portion sadly."

From the trailer, it looks as if Mike Myers is recycling his old jokes for this movie.\n\nSo after The Love Guru was released, the critics ripped the movie apart, saying Mike Myers is a \"has been\" and has lost his comedic touch. They complained that he keeps doing the some jokes over and over again in his movies, and they have a point there.\n\nSo after watching it, I was surprised at how funny I found it. Sure he rehashes some of his old jokes, but the rehashes worked well in the movie. These jokes worked better in this movie than in his Austin Powers movies. In his Austin Powers movies, he kinds of over-do it with his jokes, it's like \"Yeah, I get the joke already\", but he keeps banging the joke on your head until it loses its funniness. It seems that he's learned from his mistakes and the jokes are done very well in this movie. He has learned when to stop.\n\nPlus, compared to his previous movies, this movie is heavier on word-play jokes than physical jokes. And I like it like that."

In The Film, Myers Stars As The Titular \"Love Guru\", An Aspiring Spiritual Guide. The Character Is Irritating, Idiotic, And Racially Insensitive. The Rest Of The Cast Is Far Too Talented For This Atrocity. Justin Timberlake, Jessica Alba, Ben Kingsley, Stephen Colbert, And Mariska Hargitay In A Painful Cameo. There Would Be Absolutely No Joy In Viewing \"The Love Guru\" If It Weren't For The Brilliant Stephen Colbert. The Colbert Nation Will Love His Scenes As A Recovering Alcoholic And Sports Commentator. Colbert's Is The One And Only Thing That Keeps \"The Love Guru\" From Earning A \"0\". Mariska Hargitay Is A Great Actress That Is Totally Wasted Here. Her Name Is Used A Greeting In The World Of The Film And That Tiny Little Gimmick Is Stretched Far Beyond It's Welcome. The Scenes With Verne Troyer Are Offensive And Not Funny In Any Way. I Have No Idea Why Mike Myers Is So Obsessed With Making Jokes At The Expense Of Dwarfs. It Is Incredibly Mean-Spirited And Absolutely NOT Funny. Jessica Alba Is Totally Taken Advantage Of And Is Forced To Deliver Some Of The Dumbest And Most Misogynistic Lines In Recent Memory. Alba Has Proved Herself To Be A Talented Actress With Her Excellent Collaborations With Robert Rodriguez, But Nearly Every Other Film Gives Her Material That Is Totally Beneath Her. Justin Timberlake Is Brilliant On \"Saturday Night Live\", But His Performance Is Just As Painful As The Others. Romany Malco, The Hilarious Actor From \"Weeds\" And \"The 40-Year Old Virgin\", Is Also Wasted Here. I Couldn't Help But Wonder How The Producers Could Attain Such A Wonderful Cast With Such Dreadful Material. Daniel Tosh, Another Great Comic With A Cameo In The Film, Joked On \"tosh.0\": \"I'm In It And Even I Haven't Seen It\". \"The Love Guru Is Absolutely Atrocious. It's One Of The Worst Movies Of The Decade And Certainly One Of The Most Offensive Films To Come Out Of Hollywood In Recent Years."

I would not be surprised if this bomb sinks Mike Myer's career, any more movies like this certainly will. On top of the dreary, monotonous toilet humor, the C list celebrities, the stupid plot and the hammy, bad acting there is really nothing worthwhile in this stinker at all, no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Knowing that there are people in America that will enjoy the toilet humor and mind-numbing story only confirms that the United States is being dumbed down and it's no surprise that Will Ferrell's movies are successful in middle America!"

Instead of being funny, it all comes off as incredibly self-indulgent and sad--especially since you see so much of Mike Myers. You see Myers singing and dancing, pulling floss out of his butt, a long segment featuring a child with Myers' head superimposed on him, Myers' CONSTANT mugging as if he is saying \"Wow...ain't I cute?!\" and a constant barrage of Myers in every single season! After a very short time, it becomes very, very tiresome--like an Austin Powers movie without a single joke.\n\nAs far as the plot goes, it's all about Myers trying to reconcile a hockey player with his estranged wife....if anyone really cares. And, due to a huge number of Razzie awards and poor box office returns, no one did. Don't waste your time unless you are 100% obsessed with Mike Myers and want to watch nothing but what look like outtakes. How could a movie with this big a budget and this many guest appearances be this bad?! Crap."

There hasn't been a SNL alum that has bombed so badly since Julia Sweeneythe's \"Pat\" movie(IMDb # tt0110169). Even bad movies I give a chance hoping to see some gleaming moment of humor, meaning, or purpose. I stopped caring about the movie 5 minutes in and regrettably stopped watching and left after about an hour. Oh the things I could have done in that hour- It is truly a shame that none of that could have been completed. This movie is not only juvenile, it is just plain stupid, slow, and humorless (unless you are an awkward 10 year old that found The Cat in the Hat a work of art) Myers once said in an interview that if he can make his wife laugh at his jokes, he knows they are good. Nobody laughed at this movie when I saw it, so I hope she isn't doing you the disservice of laughing at these \"jokes\" and \"gags\"(uhggg I really hesitate calling them that). I hope Meyers sticks to the formulas for his most recent successes: Prewritten scripts for animated movies. I only hope he leaves the turn and burn movie platform (lower budget stupid movies to turn any profit) behind and re-establishes a witty persona more suited of his age.\n\nBest of luck Meyers- I will wait for your next one on DVD too."

The crudeness, not the sex, is the shocking part and filmmakers \"push the envelop\" each year, getting away with as much as they can in these PG-13 rated comedies. \"The Love Guru\" may have hit an all-time low in this regard....until another film worse comes out next month.\n\nMike Myers funny in his \"Austin Powers\" films until he got carried away with the final one of the three. That film now looks like Mary Poppins compared to this one. Myers fills the screen, almost non-stop, with penis jokes, poop, farting, boogers, every kind of sexual preference and acts known to most people. He spends 30 seconds imitating someone with diarrhea, spells out \"blow job\" on a blackboard and so many other similar \"jokes\" I'm not going to help him out by plugging them here. Most of them will have you shaking your head in disgust. You can be \"dirty\" and still be very funny, but Myers consistently crosses the line and is just plain gross.\n\nAt least he did get me to laugh out loud a half dozen times. Stephen Colbert's character is downright stupid and provided no laughs. He's the \"Hockey Night In Canada\" announcer. (If you want to hear humorous lines from a TV sports commentator, check Fred Willard's job in \"Best In Show,\" not Colbert here.)\n\nThe other members of the cast are equally lame but the saddest thing is to see Ben Kingsley, a fine actor, participating in this farce by playing an idiotic cross-eyed guru. He must have no pride in whatever roles he takes. You expect cheap laughs from Myers or Colbert....but Kingsley? Just watch this film and it will demonstrate how little the status of \"knighthood\" apparently has become in Britian.\n\n\"Extremely immature\" might be the most apt description of this comedy, which is geared for 16-year-olds, and immature ones at that!"

The only bright spots in the movie were Jessica Alba's hotness and Timberlake. Everything else was such a bore, bordering on annoying to the max. Even Colbert wasn't funny! I blame it all on the director, Marco Schnabel. He couldn't control Mike Myers, so the movie felt scattered and all over the place. The joke setups were horrible, insipid, as if they just decided to throw whatever up on the screen and see if it stuck to the wall or not. You are no JAY ROACH--that's for sure! Timberlake was at the premiere, but Myers was nowhere (or should i say \"now here\") to be seen. Maybe he was scared he would get a fruit/vegetable pelting by myself. HORRIBLE WASTE OF MY TIME. Ugh."

Mike Myers really needed to try something new, instead he took all his jokes that were popular from other films he's made (which we've all seen too many times anyway) and put them in this movie along with a lot of idiotic crap. I am a mike myers fan but I think he needs to stop with the spoof, stupid comedy movies and move onto something new."

Honestly for the life of me I wonder how Austin Powers could get great reviews then this one not get the same reviews. Maybe people don't like the middle eastern character with a goofy bready look....I can not believe peoples sense of humors changed so much. One thing for sure many of the reviews for this movie happened either before or shortly after this movie came out. Makes me wonder if people actually watched it.\n\nMy recommendation is that everyone who has seen and liked the Austin Powers movies to give this movie a chance. If you never even liked Austin Powers then skip this one. But don't come here and reject this movie off of the reviews on this site. This movie was a lot better than Zohan."

Alba's eyes are as amazing as ever, but that is the only context for the word amazing in relation to this movie. Just wait until the DVD comes out because as the clock ticks, I'd think there are only a few more hours to wait. In fact, just scour the dumpster at the local movie store because I'm sure you'll find two or three unopened copies."

To anyone out there reading this comment along with others , watch the movie and decide for yourself. Its a no-Brainer comedy movie. There are lot of crude jokes but who cares, we like a rude jokes time to time. Not all jokes have to be clean, But in the end all i will say is , Myers comedy is not everyones cup of tea, and if ur talking about rating and other people opinion as this movie been in in Bottom:100 I never understood why is \"GodFather\" in Top:100.. Soo , if u want a time pass comedy watch it, make ur own mind and if u don't like it , come back and comment on it, no one is stopping you, but if u happen to like it, come back and tell us...\n\nAs for me , its a 10/10"

The years have come and go but unfortunately they have not been kind to cinema and society in general. The reason I'm writing this letter is because I feel that deep in my heart you should SERIOUSLY consider throwing in the towel and find something else worthwhile pursuing; maybe philanthropy perhaps? If you do that not only will people respect you more but it will also help wash away all memories of those years enduring your crap after crap after crap movies. Although I can't see how this can possibly happen overnight if fate and the universe persists, it will be a sigh of relief if it was all the more true.\n\nMemories. Oh how profoundly fond those memories are and I recall watching \"Wayne's World\" when I was teeny-weeny with a more less jaded view of the world and then came \"Austin Powers\". Ahhh, the laughs those provided to help me drift away from the drudgery of life. Then a funny thing happened and the end result was a horrific turn as a pudgy, sex-innuendo laden feline several years ago. In my mind there's no denying that you should have realized that your career tanked at that point for someone once funny to even remotely consider such a perilous career move. The days of \"Austin Powers\" are gone, buddy. GROW UP AND BE A MAN!!!\n\nHaving read the news a while back of your latest endeavor, I hoped that you'll rebound after such a dog-pile-of-you-know-what of said movie. But alas, my hopes were shattered once again and as I left the theater after witnessing such a travesty of talentless vain proportions, the fragility of my mental state almost reached the breaking point when a good Samaritan saved me from what was, to be precise, an almost life-threatening ordeal. I thanked the good Samaritan of course as any sane individual would do and went our separate ways. But I will never, EVER, thank you for releasing such soul-shattering ineptness garbage that nearly killed me dared to be released for unsuspecting, innocent eyes!!!\n\nSo in conclusion, after clearing my head of the madness that I suffered, cleansed my spirit as well as my soul, I am now able to return to the outside world once again with the notion that no human being should ever go through such a horrific experience. Although I know that time doesn't heal all wounds but it is known that the human spirit is a remarkable thing that not even the likes of you and the evils of Hollywood inhabiting the blue and green world cannot comprehend. That special someone, that one individual who saved me from the madness you spewed fourth are moments like these that remind me of the good in the world. And for that, I'm grateful."

I didn't laugh once, and I really wasn't even amused. It was quite painful to watch. After 45 minutes it was evident that the story was already laid out and there was no point to continue watching as you already knew what was going to happen. Considering there was no humor up to this point, I was pretty certain that I was not going to laugh. It needed to die.\n\nThe characters were petty, shallow, and not funny. The sight gags were not funny. The writing was not funny. It was a travesty. I am really disappointed in this film.\n\nEven though it was a rental, I am going to ask for my money back.

I had a few moments of maybe \"chuckling in my head\" but those moments were few and far between in this train wreck of a film. I like the direction Mike has gone with his career, doing more dramatic roles. This was probably a dark spot in his career."

But i suppose that many people do enjoy this kind of thing, maybe. It was sort of sad, seeing as Austin Powers was funny.

Mike Myers takes turns being the strange one and being the straight man, which is good because the film doesn't turn into a farce as a result.\n\nThe plot had quite a few good twists and there's a surprise ending (two of them) that had me tearing a little at the end with laughter. My only objection might be that they made fun of dwarfs in a rude manner, and the film takes a while for you to understand what they're aiming for.\n\nBen Kingsley and Justin Timberlake win big big props for being willing to make fun of themselves on screen. Let's hope when they make Love Guru 2 they don't make the mistake they did with the Austin Powers films and make a cookie-cutter remake that parroted the first, killing off the creative.\n\nWho should see this film:\n\n-- everyone, but only if you like bathroom humor"

I have never heard so many lame one-liners in my life. I am baffled at any one who gives this a positive review. Mariska Hargitay joke was funny for about the first of 71 times.

Sure, I used to laugh like an idiot as his Austin Powers films when I was little, but keep in mind, I was a kid, I would be amused by anything, even if it's stupid today. I had somewhat of a hope for it because of Romany Malco who did pretty well in 40-year old virgin, I liked his character and it's a shame he signed on to this crap-fest of a film. Hell, SuperHero Movie is funnier than this crap.\n\nI also watched it for Jessica Alba because who's to argue that she's the hottest woman in the world. She was the only thing that kept me watching this movie. If she wasn't in it, I'd stop the movie after 5 minutes and return it to the video store for my money back. Luckily, I rented it.\n\nSeriously, this is just another Austin Powers sequel with real normal characters in it. It's the same type of humor that Austin Powers had. Also, Ben Kingsley, a great actor signed on to this film, he just lost his credibility for that. I'm not surprised with Jessica starring in this movie, she'll do any kind of movie, cuz she's clearly in it for the money, but let's face it, you go to Hollywood to make money, because I love money too, I could care less about an academy award performance. I can't sell the trophy, it's not worth anything.\n\nAnyway, 1/10 for being even more stupid than the Austin Powers series. At least those movies had Seth Green and the tent shadow scene. I wish I could rate it a -100/10. Don't buy this, and don't waste money on renting it either. This is clearly for the tweens and 8 year olds. I'm surprised this movie got a pg-13, might as well make it a G for everyone and add Disney to the title. Clearly a tween movie. That is all."

After a long arduous thought-process of approximately 12 minutes after the credits rolled, I came to the conclusion that The Love Guru is the worst film I've ever had the misfortune of surviving. Yes, it is finally time for 'Movie 43' to pass the crown. So I'm sure you are all wondering \"what makes this film the worst?\". Quite simple really. Everything. Every single aspect, every single speck of dust, every God damn spoken word. Every-flipping-thing. I'm not even going to describe the plot. That's right, I'm breaking tradition for this one review.\n\nAs a fan of Myers' previous work, I was optimistic that this could've been atleast somewhat amusing, even in a silly parody way. But oh boy, I was wrong! I've never been so wrong in all my life. This film singlehandedly destroyed Myers' career, and he only has himself to blame. He co-wrote a screenplay that contains a record number of dick jokes. Visual dick jokes, audible dick jokes, imaginary dick jokes, abbreviated dick jokes, Hindu dick jokes, Justin \"Trousersnake\" Timberlake dick jokes and elephant dick jokes. There is not a single line of dialogue that is remotely funny. Just a colossal wave of crass outdated humour that has as much appeal as two elephants shagging on an ice hockey rink (which totally does happen...). A satire on Hinduism? Give me a break! There was no sign of genuine wit in this horrific script. And the worst part is that Myers thought he was actually being hilarious. \"Yes Mike, say wiener one more time? And fart? And repeat the same joke twelve more times? Cut! That's a wrap!\". Ben Kingsley, who I cannot believe agreed to be even remotely involved, was cross eyed for the entire film. Funny? No. Cringe-worthy? Definitely. Jessica Alba was only there for her dashing good looks so that Myers could pleasure himself between takes. Troyer makes a return, just so that we can all reminisce about 'Austin Powers'. Y'know, a time when Myers was comedically creative.\n\nAfter the utter tripe of ice hockey, love advice, cock wrestling (rooster obviously, you dirty bugger) and celebrity cameos, the film concludes on a stereotypical Bollywood musical number that just leaves an incredibly sour taste in one's mouth. \"Oh but, they are writing a love letter to Bollywood films! Everything looks so colourful and musical and...\" STOP right there. You're telling me that Myers wrote this to show his appreciation for Bollywood flicks? Didn't think so. The worst crime is that they \"Bollywood-ised\" (Trade-frickin'-mark) Parton's '9 To 5', all in the first two minutes! I can't. Nope. I'm done. If a comedy is unfunny, unwatchable, uncharismatic and un-flipping-believably torturous, then it's a failure. No guru can advise me to watch this ever again."

A current 3.5 on IMDb is proof that if you get enough people to say some things crap then most people will see crap no matter what and forget the times the movie made them laugh. Or like a friend of mine who has a built in stereotype of comedies of this kind, anything with stupid or gross-out humor makes him forget about all other times the movie was funny. I'm not saying this, or movies of this kind are great by no means, but horrible and unwatchable they are not, and not deserving of a low ratting just for it's lower moments of comedy. OK, personnel venting out of the way, this is far from a great film. Funny at times but not enough, Jessica Alba's movie choices continue to make me wonder and after Justin Timberlake's fantastic work in both Alpha Dog and Black Snake Moan, this is a huge step back for him. Hell the fact that I just said Justin Timberlake and fantastic in the same sentence should be reason enough to keep him away from The Love Guru. Not that his character in this could have been way better, because it could have, I'm not sure if that's bad writing or bad directing. Honestly though, should anyone be even commenting on directing in a film like this, it's just one sketch scene after another with a little story to keep things moving. Wow, I have gone on way longer then this film deserves."

This movie is basically a bunch of little jokes he always wanted to do in his other huge movies but never got the opportunity. If you like extremely corny, \"bu-dun-chshhh\" jokes then this is the movie for you. Go see it if you just want to sit back and have a laugh. Don't expect this movie to go down in history as one of Mike Myers best.\n\nAs for the other big names in this movie...\n\nJessica Alba - still can't act Justin Timberline - keep singing - never act again.\n\nI did like the cross-mix of other very hilarious comedians who make cameos in this movie. Obviously I will not give out any names.\n\nWhat it all comes down to is if you like Mike Myers, you like corny joke after corny joke, and you want it all in under 1hr and a half, then go see this movie! If you don't like Mike Myers - then stay home!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I remember when the first Austin Powers movie came out. I was a teenager back then and I just thought the movie was brilliant. I have rewatched it many times. To this day, me and my friends have inside jokes, like Dr Evil's ticks, much like today's kids have Borat. And hey, he was also in the Wayne's World movies and was funny in SNL. He couldn't do any wrong.\n\nHowever, the sequel was a huge hit and Myers seems to have taken the wrong lesson from that movie's success. The things that made the first Austin Powers movie funny were NOT the fart jokes, they never were. The third movie was a complete disgrace, with Myers trying to imitate Eddie Murphy's bad habit of impersonating many characters and upping the ante with bad taste jokes. Perhaps more alarming was the distinct impression that he was the only one laughing at his jokes, to the point when it just got embarrassing.\n\nKeep in mind that I'm someone who even likes Rob Schneider's comedies (except for The Animal) and virtually every parody movie I can get my hands on - including the equally-hated Meet The Spartans. I have high tolerance towards silly and stupid comedies.\n\nWell, here Myers does it again. Guru \"Pitka\", his character, is a well-meaning but incompetent spiritual guru who wants to be more famous than Deepak Chopra. The problem is that his incompetence includes his joke-telling skills. You know it. When Myers tells a joke, then there's an uncomfortable moment, and then he explodes into laughter forcing the other person to laugh along so as not to make things even more uncomfortable. It's really telling and ironic that Myers himself did that exact thing as Dr. Evil, but back then it was funny. Now it's not.\n\nVerne Troyer is here but now he's the head coach (!) of The Toronto Maple Leafs. All the main actors are okay, since the plot doesn't demand too much from them, and there are more than a few cameo appearances. However, there were two unexpected surprises: John Oliver of The Daily Show fame as the Guru's \"agent\" and the now legendary Stephen Colbert - he's hilarious in every scene he's in.\n\nMyers sometimes uses clever inside jokes - some that hockey fans or Canadians will get, some that \"Wayne's World\" fans will get, and some that are so lame that nobody really gets.\n\nTo be fair though, this doesn't deserve the abysmal rating it's getting. There are a few laughs and the sheer absurdity of some scenes is hilarious. Unfortunately, though, the bulk of The Love Guru's jokes really concerns farts and uncomfortable moments.\n\nAs a comedy on a lazy day, I give it a 5/10. However I cannot really defend The Love Guru because I think it's time for Myers to stop doing movies like this and be funny again without resorting to lame plots and fart jokes. We've had enough of that."

This is Mike Myers, putting on an Indian accent, not being funny and doing this for 90 minutes.\n\nThe movie is filled with sexual innuendo that wore out it's welcome very quickly because it was too obvious. Unfunny jokes. Gross out humor. And Jessica Alba. No offense to Ms Alba because she looks amazing but the woman is a terrible actress. Add to that absolute fantasy that somehow the Toronto Maple Leafs would win the Stanley Cup and you know this has just gone off the rails.\n\nI wanted to like this movie. I really did.

Here's a suggestion, they should have a warning flash in movies that alerts you when you are almost half way through a film. Everyone involved should feel ashamed for being part of this project. Mr Myers you owe me $14 for the movie, $6 for snacks, $6 for gas and 88 minutes of my life back. If anyone involved in this movie has ever received an Academy Award, you should return it."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have now seen all of Mike Myers' films in which he plays a starring role, and this is definitely the worst. He has proved that he is a very funny man with the likes of Austin Powers and Wayne's World but he seemed to have forgotten all what made those movies funny with The Love Guru. It's pretty bad, though slightly better than its reputation. Though not much.\n\nThere are hardly any jokes that are funny, and 95% are toilet humour or sex jokes. And not funny ones. I laughed maybe 3 times throughout, one of which in the credits with Verne Troyer. It's not helped by the fact that the Guru Pitka is an unlikeable character. For some reason Myers laughs at his own bad jokes often in this film, possibly in the hope you'll join in. Maybe you will out of sympathy.\n\nWhen a decent joke pops up Myers usually ruins it by explaining the joke, like with the crocodile soup one. You don't need to explain a joke Mike! You usually didn't do that in your previous films, so why do it here? Myers comic timing here is hit and miss, sometimes it's decent enough such as when he stares at the camera for a split second after Bohemian Rhapsody starts playing in a car (Wayne's world reference) but sometimes he just never demonstrates this quality at all. Comedy is all about timing, Mike Myers nailed it perfectly in the first Austin Powers, so he clearly has (or did have) the ability.\n\nIt's hard to believe this had such a high budget as it looks appears cheap in terms of its effects and obviously it's content. The acting is not great from Jessica Alba, Sir Ben Kingsley makes an appearance and I suppose does the best he could have done with the material. Mike Myers is a funny guy, I am surprised that such a capable comedian could come up with such a poor film.\n\nThe story could have been interesting but it wasn't. Needed far better writing. Myers was given too much control and needed someone to say no, these ideas are no good. It's a shame to see it as he was once so funny. I did enjoy the rendition of Dolly Parton's 9 to 5 at the start, Myers is a surprisingly good singer. I also appreciated the unpretentiousness of the film, it's aware that it's not that good and it never strives to be anything else than a lowbrow comedy.\n\nOverall though this is a film that is not worth seeing and I would rate it 4/10."

His heart is in the right place with this one and when you enjoy it for it's watchability then you're not disappointed. It's only when you try and inject an air of believability in to it that you start to wander into the critic realms and forget that you are watching this for fun, myers has never professed to making believable movies and so this is one that should just be enjoyed for the basic easy going humour that we all enjoy as kids, as that is where I think He is heading with this one, please regress to your childhood and enjoy the giggle humour, Shakespeare it ain't!!!"

His journey of enlightenment is apparently to insult people (usually with that familiar word that starts with \"f\"). He chases women, gives advice on how to offend women and therefore get one, etc. There are no laughs, no memorable moments, no reasons to watch this whatsoever. In addition to Myers self-destructing, Jessica Alba continues her challenge to set a record for consecutive lousy performances in worthless movies. Her current run of these career-ending disasters is a number roughly equal to the number of miles that light travels in a year.\n\nThis rubbish isn't even good enough for \"straight to video\" release.

        "review_detailed_main": "Before seeing this movie I'd read a few scathing reviews. So, I went into this movie expecting the worst. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The film is fair, with several hysterical laugh out loud moments.\n\nI do believe that there are too many emotional threads which may have lead to the generation of so many poor reviews. There are times where the movie struggles to have heart, but fails. Other instances the movie wants to have high action, which is decent. And further times where the film goes straight to potty humor, which is raunchy and pretty good. Some of the characters could have been given more depth. For example, Jessica Alba's character is fairly weak, as is Myer's side kick/assistant. Although entertaining, Myers' character is not very engaging or admirable. The main character's self realization is undercut by the lack of high quality writing coupled with the lack of character depth.\n\nThere are some pluses however. Justin Timberlake's character is great. Way over the top! There is some good physical comedy, and the elephant scene is hysterical. The interaction of Stephen Colbert and Jim Gaffigan is excellent (reminded me of the sports commentators from Bedazzled-2000.) I like the fact that they used real NHL teams and such, Rob Blake appeared for his team, and that action looked fairly authentic. I was also surprised that Deepak Chopra himself appeared in the film.\n\nIt would seem that the script was one draft shy of finding success. However, having to satisfy the studio, NHL, and Deepak Chopra may have led to the weakness of the script. If you come to this movie with low expectations you will probably enjoy it. However, if you are coming to this movie expecting the next great film from Myers, you will no doubt be sorely disappointed. Take it for what it is worth, a 90 minute diversion from real life, brain candy, and all in fun."

Myers is hit and miss for me, he was good in the Austin Powers movies and Shrek but he is awful in this and Cat in the Hat. His mugging tries to be endearing but it is actually quite irritating. The rest of the cast try but it is all a bit of a wasted effort. The Love Guru is also very silly, repetitive and predictable, with a dreadful script, poor direction and a clich\u00e9d story. Overall, I didn't like it. Just for the record, I love comedy, but I disliked The Love Guru so much it's making me feel that Myers' career has well and truly gone down the plug. 1/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't understand the hate for this movie. If you are being totally objective, this movie's \"quality\" of humor is no worse than in Mike Myer's last two Austin Powers movies...lots of body fluid jokes, penis jokes, defecating jokes, midget jokes, etc. And if you can tolerate ridiculous characters like Fat Bastard I don't see why you would have any problem with the ones in this movie. I actually found Verne Troyer to be quite funny in this one and not just because of his midgetness. He delivered some of the best lines. I also thought Stephen Colbert's portrayal of the insane sportscaster to be quite hilarious. Anyway, overall this was a lot like Myer's previous comedies...a lot of vulgar jokes, some don't work, some do...but I think I found myself laughing more watching the Love Guru than the Austin Powers movies."

Jessica Alba was eh. Verne Troyer was right on and gave one of the better performances in the film, although none of the performances were memorable. If you're a big Mike Myers fan, wait for the DVD, unfortunately, as hopefully there were be better footage on the behind the scenes takes.\n\nIt just missed the mark and did not offer anything that had not already been done before."

And his jogging hand waving again was so much like happy seminar self-help people that I nearly peed my pants. Guru Pitka's seminar was so funny. Mariska Hargity was genius. You know why these self-help millionaire people smile just like Mike Myers? Because they are making an easy living 9 to 5 telling us why we are miserable.\n\nI brought my DVD to a Buddhist friend's house to see the movie and they thought it was delightfully funny. They were not offended in the least bit. I asked them if they knew Deepak Chopra and they pulled two of his books from the coffee table. I nearly choked with laughter.\n\nOkay, so you don't get the movie. Go read some self-help book, go to a couple of seminars, take yoga and definitely go listen to a few guru. You will get it."

What was there is a competent Maxwell Smart saving the world and getting the girl which made its humor earnest not anarchic. The willing grin became a dyspeptic grimace as plot and heroism replaced comedy.\n\nThat experience made going to 'The Love Guru' potentially an exercise in masochism...here we go again, I thought. A non comedic comedy.\n\nAnd, indeed, a shaky start had me concentrating on counting the number of Peanut M&Ms in the yellow bag I had bought along with a diet coke because I'm counting calories as well. OK, penis jokes, flatulence, a midget, cross eyes...tedious tedium again? Then, twenty minutes in, the sheer exuberance of Mike Myers with rapid fire penis/flatulence/midget/cross eyed jokes, Bollywood dance numbers, love of hockey, love/hate of Canada, use of celebrity to attract celebrities to play roles in this movie overcame all and I went with the comedy.\n\nMike Myers is shameless, who knew? He is over the top, quelle surprise! He is cross cultural and topical in allusion and jokes, what a nightmare!\n\nLet him go, accept that it is a Mike Myers film. Let an ashram, sitar, elephant, Oprah, chastity belt, tasteless, adolescent,Deeprak, motorized carpet hockey movie wash over you. Let your inner self be itself, admit that if even every fourth penis joke is actually funny, in a movie with 4.2 million of them that is still a million laughs."

When it comes to interweaving crass, sexual innuendo jokes and synonyms into a script and storyline, Mel Brooks is a master. He knows how to do off color with color, flair and most importantly class. He knows when to stop and when enough is enough. Mike Myers is clearly no Mel Brooks\u0085not even close.\n\nThis movie from start to finish is a crass satirical pun on the whole guru movement and \"guru's\" everywhere. Interlaced with constant sexual innuendo, some more obvious and crass than others, Myers is attempting to make us laugh at the stupidity of people believing in guru's and the whole concept of the over marketed and under delivered shyster guru's that inundate our society. Whereas I do believe that guru's of all shapes and sizes have tended to prey on the weak emotions and psychological wants and needs to build their existences versus actually delivering quantifiable product, thereby giving continued credence to P.T. Barnum's statement \"There's a sucker born every minute!\" And clearly, Myers has capitalized on this lemming mentality as well in the crowds following the master guru's in his movie. But he does so with a dialog soaked in crass sexual innuendo.\n\nNow, I like a good pun probably as much if not more than the next person and truth be told, there's a few really good lines and scenes in here\u0085but way too few\u0085and one of the best comes during the credits as a blooper\u0085now that's really sad! Not even the absolutely stunning and beautiful Jessica Alba couldn't save this one.\n\nAdd this one to the growing list of \"movies best not made\", and go see something else.\n\nAnd that's the way I saw it, From Where I Stand."

It's like Adam Sandler and Rob Schneider being in the same movie a bunch of times, you know you're in for a boat load of the same comedy. All comedians have their own way of telling jokes and audiences will take it in differently. Most of the jokes told in this movie are more for the \"sick minded\" and those who aren't, will have a hard time understanding them."

In my opinion his schtick already started getting kinda old about halfway through the second \"Austin Powers\"-movie, maybe \"The Love Guru\" never really had a fighting chance to begin with. Guru Pitka may be a new character (actually even that's negotiable), but don't let that fool you: this is basically just a fourth \"Austin Powers\"-movie. The jokes all seem like rejected material from previous efforts, and the obligatory sexual innuendo is somehow even more tiresome than the one in \"Goldmember\". To compensate for the fact that none of the jokes work, Myers had a rock-solid solution though: just have Jessica Alba's character crack up at everything. Seriously, I can't even remember any of her lines, just constant unconvincing laughter at absolutely nothing. The most painful role is for Ben Kingsley though, this movie makes you long for the days when he played bit parts in Uwe Boll movies. Even Jim Gaffigan is unfunny in this movie, how is that even done? This thing flopped for good reason. Now where did I put my \"Wayne's World\"-DVD?"

Not to mention a lot of sexual and penis jokes, and many continuity jokes such as spelling words into acronyms, Guru adding \"TM\" at the end of an acronym, annoying NHL commentators, etc.\n\nThe Love Guru plot is basically about Guru Pikta (Myers) whom wants to surpass Deepak Chopra in celebrity, so he takes an offer from the owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs (Jessica Alba) to get star player Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco) back with his girl (Meagan Good), who has been swept away by rival Jacques \"Le Coq\" Grande (Justin Timberlake) of the Los Angeles Kings. That seems pretty stupid and unrealistic even for a comedy.\n\nOne thing that was okay was Mike Myers performances. It seemed tat he tried and it was pretty entertaining. Though the supporting cast was pretty boring and dull. In general the Love Guru insultingly stupid, filled with embarrassingly bad jokes. The occasional guest star appearances is amusing, but the movie is just dreadful and badly written."

What Meyer's doesn't seem to understand is that what made the Powers movies as enjoyable as they were was that the fact the jokes the Austin Powers character spouted were dumb and in bad taste was much more funny that the actual jokes themselves. In other words, we were all laughing at how incredibly and sublimely stupid most of the jokes were, not at the jokes themselves. Powers was a clueless character who was stupid and emotional arrested enough to think that what he was saying and doing was clever and funny\u0097he was funny because he was so pathetic yet so joyful about it. Powers was the perfect character for the type of humor Myers used in those films. But the formula just doesn't translate to The Love Guru. Without the proper context, the dick and feces jokes seem imposed on the story instead of being part of the whole concept. Meyers seems to have forgotten that we were very definitely laughing AT Austin Powers, yet he seems to want us to laugh WITH the guru Pitka."

I am a fan of the Austin Powers series (except for the goldmember)and this to me was pretty much like an Austin Powers 4 (similar jokes and gags). Funnier than the third, not as good as the second.\n\nThe whole premise of this movie was retarded to begin with (not going to go too much into the plot). It started out kind of awkwardly and a lot of the scene transitions did not flow smoothly. Most of the movie was based on physical comedy with a couple of humorous jokes. There was a lot of toilet humor and penis jokes as well. I laughed maybe 5-6 times throughout the whole movie. The whole acronym thing gets old very fast. The theater did laugh more than I did but I think it was just to be polite to Mike Meyers/Justin Timberlake and the writers/producers/director of the film who were in the audience.\n\nThe one thing I very much enjoyed about this movie was the ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS Jessica Alba. She looked EXTREMELY hot in this movie, hotter than anything she has ever been in. I was just mesmerized watching her, especially when she was wearing the Indian saris (dresses) and doing the dances. Oh my. Cash Warren has to be the luckiest man in the world.\n\n5/10"

I wish Mike Myers would step up and explain why he chose to be in this movie, as he is a funny actor and has proved this in other films. None of the obviously set up lines in this movie are remotely funny, nor are they creative. Most of them are repeats of earlier lines said at the beginning of the film, just worded differently. The acting is mediocre at best, although it is most likely worsened by the horrible script. I also believe that the plot was set up for the wrong reasons. Although Mike Myers was born in Toronto, the movie focuses much too obviously on Canada, and it seems to attempt to get a good feeling of pride out of the viewer, be it the Toronto Maple Leafs being the focus of the movie or Jessica Alba's lines displaying her pride of being Canadian. Instead it just made the movie seem even more pretentious. Overall The Love Guru was a terrible film that I wish could return the wasted time I spent watching it."

He isn't shy about trying every racist joke and stereotype about Indians. His humor is that of a 5 year old with many many fart and punching someone in the nuts jokes. The advice he gives is shallow and the whole trademark thing makes no sense. He needs someone who can support his kind of comedy, which in this film can not be done by Alba or Romany Malco(the hokey player with love problems) and neither is Myers expressive enough to make the whole chewed through story work.\n\nThe rest of the cast is forgetful at best and fills you with rage at worst(WTF Ben Kingsley)\n\nThe story of course is the other part, not only is the script predictable, I also got the feeling as if they were trying to make fun of every minority in the flick and that in a painfully hateful and unfunny way. They make inappropriate jokes about little people, African American and to some extend even Canadian and none of it works.\n\nI recommend you watch it if you are looking deep into your wine bottle or just want a new reason to hate humanity."

The most common joke is to have a characters name resemble something vulgar, such as \"Dick Pants\" or some other Grade 3 level joke. The next most common is the Guru's constant repeating of \"TM\" after one of his catchphrases. It wasn't funny the first time, what made Meyers think it would be funny the tenth or fifteenth? There's also the repetition of jokes from Austin Powers, ranging from the plane to even the casting of Verne Troyer, the midget who made one of his only popular appearances in the Powers films as Mini-Me. Finally, there are the gags that are just plain lame. These involve elephants humping each other, the Guru wearing a chastity belt, the Guru having a battle using mops soaked in urine, the Guru sticking his head up his own ass (which is actually far less funny than it sounds), the Guru getting punched in the groin, the Guru doing battle with a rooster and the Guru engaging in two very long song and dance numbers on the Sitar, one a rendition of Dolly Parton's \"9 to 5\", the other a ear-splitting variation on \"Space Cowboy\" by Steve Miller Band. Both are in there for no particular reason whatsoever (and I really do hope it wasn't for laughs).\n\nThe other actors are fairly bad, although they really don't have much to work with. Jessica Alba continues her tradition of playing practically the same exact character, giggling and acting ditsy. Justin Timberlake is atrocious as Jacque Grande, although to be fair, his character was a one-note joke about Quebecois people. I'm bemused that Meyers would think Americans would find a joke about a people they likely know little about funny, especially when I didn't find it funny and I'm a Canadian. Verne Troyer just proves that the only reason he has even a semblance of a career is because of the novelty that he's a midget."

I suppose that's like saying that a common cold is the best illness to have or that Scary Spice is the best Spice Girl because at the end of the day it's still a bad experience and something to forget.\n\nDespite all the bad, make that very bad or even extremely bad, reviews for The Love Guru it's not as horrible as some people might think. For example, it's definitely better than Batman and Robin, Daddy Day Camp and Epic Movie (perhaps all put together) but worse than Semi-Pro, Jumper and You Don't Mess with the Zohan. And it is definitely worse than Austin Powers and Wayne's World by a long shot. The film does ask you the question throughout: should I be laughing with or at the jokes. The film certainly doesn't take itself seriously although at times some characters become thoughtful and for lack of a better word open up. Sometimes you don't know what you're doing, mainly what you're doing in the theater, but in the end you realize that it could be worse, much worse.\n\nThe plot centers around an American-Indian guru named Pitka (Mike Myers), the author of many self-help books and seminars, who dreams of making it big in America primarily through appearing on The Oprah Winfrey Show. He gets his chance when the Toronto Maple Leafs ice hockey team owner Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba) and the team's coach (Verne Troyer) seek Pitka's help in curing the team's star love-sick player Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco). Roanoke's wife Prudence (Meagan Good) has recently left him for LA Kings goalkeeper Jacques Grande (Justin Timberlake) who's \"talents\" are not limited to the ice rink. Pitka, aided by his Indian colleague Rajneesh (Manu Narayan), sees this as his one chance to hit the big time and appear on Oprah and ultimately emulate his idol Deepak Chopra.\n\nAlthough on paper the plot seems quite involved and thought-out it's really just another failure in a long list. It's almost as if the film is merely a side project for all involved, something they shot on weekends, and that they have bigger and better things to do. Or is it that they are simply untalent and incapable in the first place. Verne Troyer is no Warwick Davis or Peter Dinklage and his role seems almost distasteful and offensive to his size. Jessica Alba again proves that although she might be a pretty face she cannot even delivery the most simplest of expression or emotion. The Love Guru adds yet another in a line of poor performances from her and sits soundly next to the likes of Fantastic Four, Good Luck Chuck, Honey and The Eye. It seems her only one good role to date was in Sin City, mainly because that film was directed by a credible and talented director in Robert Rodriquez. It really shows that good performances are usually in half due to the director guiding them. That's probably one of the reasons this film falls flat. Marco Schnabel has never directed a feature length movie and after this you'll wish he'd go back to school. After seeing The Love Guru you could say that one of the reasons Austin Powers was so good was because of its director Jay Roach, as it definitely takes more than a funny script to make a funny film. Some reviews have suggested that Justin Timberlake saves this film but my opinion is the opposite \u0096 he makes it worse. His comedic timing is terrible as is his accent. His Celine Dion-loving character is meant to be from Quebec (French-Canadian) but I'm not quite sure what he was trying to pull off \u0096 it was like a bad Borat impersonation that only your friends laugh at. That you can only asked yourself why one Sir Ben Kingsley, Knight of the Realm and more importantly Leading Actor Academy Award-winner is doing in this. I can only presume that perhaps he just felt like having a bit of fun. Also to mention, Rajneesh becomes incredibly annoying as Pitka's side-kick to such an extent that you feel like praying to the Devil himself that he be strike down. The supporting cast is quite good, mainly because they simply haven't got the screen time to affect them. These include Stephen Colbert and Jim Gaffigan, John Oliver, and Romany Malco does a better than expected job making him one of the few unhurt from the cast.\n\nIn all the blame has to go to Mike Myers. He clearly a victim of his own success from the likes of Austin Powers and even Shrek as he probably believes that anything he touches will turn to box office and critical gold. The genitalia jokes in this film are endless so much so that it was almost like Myers' was dared by a friend to make a comedy made up entirely of crotch orientated gags. I knew from nearly every review I had read prior to seeing this film that it was full of them but never knew the extent until viewing it for myself. I found one part as a perfect example, although quite early on in the movie it sums up the entire 90mins. When John Oliver's character walks into the room to meet Pitka, Rajneesh announces that Richard Pants as arrived to which Pitka responds \"Ah yes, Dick Pants\". Myers' constant references to his home country and his favorite hockey team (which leads him to appearing as himself) tend to get over-cooked as well.\n\nIn all there are almost endless new release films to choose from, both at the cinemas and on DVD, so The Love Guru should really be at the bottom of many people's list. This film will leave some disappointed and some really, maybe even extremely, disappointed. But note the key word that remains there: disappointed."

Since then my daughter (who was five in 2000) have gotten hooked on his Austin Powers films.\n\nWe both walked out of the theatre after viewing Guru and said, \"It wasn't very good and I really liked it.\" The spiritual ideas are sound but it's his joy of life that comes through. Like that of Deepak Chopra.\n\nYes, the pooh-pooh jokes are sometimes old, sometimes gross but for those that are used to it, they don't deter.\n\nCompare the joyous nature of Mike's character in this film (which truly is 'his') and that of Cat in the Hat. How can you go wrong with Dr. Suess? But Cat falls flat.\n\nThis is not a hit for the masses. Screw that! I hope he continues to make 'his' films, his way."

As such, I won't be the first to tell you that Mike Myers is a talented actor, director, and writer, and that he CAN have charisma on-screen.\n\nI saw this movie as one of the \"Similar to\" movies that came up when you searched for Austin Powers, and I thought that it looked like classic Mike Myers antics. After watching this movie, I felt that it didn't live up to the expectations I had.\n\nAll throughout the movie, I felt like I was watching a movie that wanted to be like Austin Powers, but couldn't conjure up the comedic genius or the iconic protagonist. The Guru is annoying, cocky, crude (and not in the funny way), and overall forgettable. His backstory isn't interesting, the plot isn't intriguing, and the comedy just doesn't fill in the gaps. There's jokes that are funny, sure, but occasional jokes that make me blow air through my nostrils aren't enough to hold this movie up, especially when it's a comedy.\n\nThe acting feels particularly terrible as well. The Guru switches between having an Indian accent and a slightly-British accent? Everyone fawns over the Guru, but nothing feels genuine. Verne Troyer isn't even good, either.\n\nThis movie is supposed to be a parody, and parodies are fun! That's the reason I and everyone else love the Austin Powers series. But this feels like it's trying too hard to find things to parody. Comedy cannot be forced, but this movie really wants to try and shove it down your throat. If you like it, you like it. If you don't, you don't. All I can say is that if you wanted the same charm as Austin Powers, you'll be disappointed."

        "review_detailed_main": "My Take: Too much shock humor but not any real laughs; there's very little show of Myers talents here.\n\nAlthough we all know him by name, we really got to know Mike Myers not from his name but from the name of the characters he plays. In fact, if his name wasn't so prominent in the credits, we would get to know him as the guy who played Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Wayne, as well as the voice of Shrek. Bu recently, the characters he plays are like retreads of his old acts. First there's THE CAT IN THE HAT, which didn't really go so well. And now here's THE LOVE GURU. Well, Myers is still the best thing about THE LOVE GURU, but he can't save it. Not only is his act unoriginal, Myers tries to throw in every single sex joke or gross-out humor and see which one sticks.\n\nMyers plays his most forgettable character yet as Guru Pitka aka Maurice, who plays every single joke in the Mike Myers' book. From the witty word play and the funny accents, there's not much more original in this act that all he does is paint-by-numbers. I give credit, however, to Myers for doing whatever he can with the character and does score maybe a few puns. Now ask yourself how good those puns are compared to those that don't work? Guys hitting each other with mops covered in pee? Ben Kingsley being awful as Maurice's cross-eyed guru? An elephant sex scene? I'm beginning to wonder if I was watching a comedy or a test of endurance. It's as if the movie already wants you to leave by the 15-minute mark, and this movie is supposed to be mercifully short with an 87-minute running time.\n\nEveryone else in the supporting cast is embarrassing; funny thing is they seem to enjoy doing so. Jessica Alba, who seems to like appearing in every bad film her agent gets her into, is your typical love interest. Justin Timberlake gives an awful performance in an awful excuse of a comical character. And the list goes on, with some truly unnecessary cameos by Stephen Colbert, Val Kilmer, Jessica Simpson, and Kanye West. Besides perhaps a few witty word puns and some shtick about a moving remote control pillow (hey, there's got to be one scene I laughed in, but I just can't recall), THE LOVE GURU is quite an unfunny disaster, but I don't want to bring down Myers' spirit. Mike Myers, you're still funny, just stop making these movies.\n\nRating: * out of 5."

        "review_detailed_main": "In Mike Myers' career as a comedian, he has had a lot of success, with \"Saturday Night Live\" sketches, the two Wayne's World movies, the Austin Powers trilogy, and the voice of the popular computer animated character, Shrek. However, there have also been low points in his career, most notably his starring role in the poor full-length adaptation of Dr. Seuss' \"The Cat in the Hat\", from 2003, and this 2008 flop, \"The Love Guru\". Unlike \"The Cat in the Hat\", Myers not only starred in this film, he was also a writer for it, just like he was with the Wayne's World and Austin Powers movies. Unlike the comedian's previous full-length writing efforts, this one isn't funny. I thought it would be worse, judging by how much criticism it had received, but like most people, I didn't laugh.\n\nMaurice Pitka was born in America but raised in India, in the village of Harenmahkeester. At the age of twelve, he was given a chastity belt by Guru Tugginmypudha, forced to wear it until he found love in himself. He is now a guru, still wearing the belt, and dreaming of being the #1 guru and appearing on the \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\". He is called over to Toronto, Ontario, Canada by widely despised Toronto Maple Leafs owner Jane Bullard, to help Darren Roanoke, one of the hockey team's players. Roanoke has been troubled since his wife, Prudence, left him for French Canadian Los Angeles Kings goalie Jacques Grand\u00e9, which has been affecting his performance. Guru Pitka's job is to help the Leafs player with his troubles so he will play hockey as well as he used to. He attempts to get Roanoke back with his wife and get the troubled Leafs player to stand up to his aggressive mother.\n\nBefore I watched this comedy flop, I knew it was widely abhorred for its immature potty humour. While the lame gross-out humour isn't as extreme or consistent as I expected, you can be sure it's still there. There's more than one booger joke, plus excretion gags, such as an elephant defecating, the flashback with the \"stink mop\" (a mop soaked in urine) used for fight training, and Guru Pitka making diarrhea noises. In addition to the bathroom jokes, there are also very juvenile sex jokes, including elephant sex on the hockey rink! In addition to the crude physical gags, there are also verbal ones, which also happen to be weak. Many modern comedies show that sex and toilet humour can really be funny, but \"The Love Guru\" is one of many other modern comedies that show this kind of humour can also be really lame. Not only is Myers not funny in this movie, neither is Stephen Colbert as sex-crazed stoner hockey announcer Jay Kell, or anyone else in the cast who may try to be funny. After seeing the film, I'm also convinced that pop sensation Justin Timberlake, who plays Jacques Grand\u00e9 here, can't act, which doesn't help the fact that I don't respect him as a singer, either.\n\nAll the hatred for this movie made me think that maybe Mike Myers had sunk to the level of Tom Green, another comedian from my country, but a much less talented one. Fortunately, it turns out he hasn't, but he's still going to have to come up with something funnier than this if he wants to recover his career. While watching \"The Love Guru\", I didn't laugh at all, and don't think I even smiled, even if there were parts where I came close, whether that was a good thing or not. I guess it takes a lot for a movie to REALLY disgust me, but I think I've made it clear that I'm still not impressed with this particular comedy. I'm not sure if it was worthy of beating \"Meet the Spartans\" and \"Disaster Movie\" at the Razzies (I haven't seen either of those films, but seeing Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer's previous project, \"Epic Movie\", was enough to tell me that the duo just might know the definition of unfunny better than anyone else in the history of comedy), but coming from a comedian who has talent, I'm sure this film has come as a shock to many people! If you love puerile adolescent humour, then maybe this film is for you. If not, then I suggest you skip it."

There was not one positive or even a neutral review, they were all very, very brutal and i felt like the reviewers just didn't give the movie a chance... I could kind of understand what the reviewers meant, but i didn't expect it not to be funny so I had to see it for myself.\n\nI was very bored and so I just gave it a shot; didn't expect to watch more than half of it. I wanted to give it a chance but actually had lost all hope. But I watched all of it, and loved all of it. I watched it on my own and really laughed out loud. It was joke after joke and they were all so corny.\n\nWhat I like of Mike Myers is how he doesn't take himself too serious, I mean he doesn't take himself serious at all!! A lot of people just don't appreciate that kind of humour, but I know a lot do. Maybe the movie was seen by the wrong target audience. This movie really is for people who can enjoy toilet humour, giggles and awkward situations.\n\nIf you enjoy this, you should definitely watch this movie or even give it a second chance."

        "review_detailed_main": "For context I'm a big Austin Powers/Waynes World fan so I *DO* get his humour and I'm not a brainless teen either. I'm a 34 year White male from England who enjoys both 'simple' comedy and more intelligent subtle stuff, if it matters. I've only said this as there is far too much talk of the reasons why people are rating this down but the movie itself is all the evidence you need to see why it's rated low.\n\nSadly I think the funny content from The Love Guru could have been condensed into a 5 minute SNL sketch and worked just as well (OK, would have worked better).\n\nI felt the beginning was extremely rushed, the set up was poor and lazy. All the characters were lifeless drones and mostly arbitrary, I didn't know why I should care about anyone.\n\nI felt Mike didn't make enough of his character, didn't develop him fully and it was to me a mix of 3 of his previous characters (Fat B******d, Dr Evil and Austin Powers) in one but not as funny or as strong as any of them, certainly not when it's just a single character trying to carry an entire film.\n\nIt was just weak all round, packed with overused/under-funny puns. There were one or two moments that were genuinely funny or amusing, but by about half way through I just gave up caring and found myself just not laughing anymore.\n\nIt didn't feel like a Mike Myers movie, it felt like someone had written/directed a movie that they THOUGHT captured the humour of Austin Powers but missed the mark badly. It was a 'by the numbers' attempt at the winning Austin Powers humour that just doesn't work with this set of characters and this plot. A very very thin plot I may add, even for a Mike Myers comedy.\n\nOn top of that you have the main cast who in my opinion were all miscast except for the main 'hockey player' character who was believable and did a decent job. Perhaps part of the problem though was that Mike Myers should have been playing these central characters himself to fully develop the humour in the film, then again maybe that's just wishful thinking given the terrible pacing and careless direction of the film.\n\nI couldn't get a handle on just 'who' Guru Pitka 'was'. He was a mix of all MM's characters but none unique to the new character. It was just very hard to feel anything for GP as his persona seemed to change from scene to scene in the most haphazard/distracting way. A lack of consistency basically.\n\nYou could never accuse Dr Evil of fluctuating in character throughout a film to the point you give up believing in him or stop caring about his 'funny lines'. Essentially the main character of the Love Guru just isn't strong or compelling enough, maybe he'd be OK as a small character on an Austin Powers movie but he was dreadful as the lead (and only) Mike Myers character on an entire film.\n\nLet's just hope they don't make 2 sequels to this terrible waste of talent and potential and with any luck they MAY realise just how special the Austin Powers films were and make some more of those instead of worrying about having to change for the sake of it. Change is good but only if you do better than before, Every single one of the Mike Myers characters that has appeared in an Austin Powers movie could have made a better lead character for a film or spin off than this totally unconvincing 'love guru'.\n\n3/10 from me and that's only because of MM of whom I'm a big fan and appreciate for all of his previous, very very funny films."

It felt like Mike Myers had gone off into his own little Mike's World which bore little resemblance to what anyone else found funny. Maybe its too much to expect one man to keep churning out gems like AustinPowers and WW which were undoubtedly good and original. Love Guru. An attempt to satire the self help, new age, spiritual movement's big-hitters and money-makers. A good target maybe. Maybe not. It certainly didn't expand into a good movie. Being 6 years ago I thankfully don't remember much about it. I do remember my 13 year old son being as baffled as I was. Films like this actually get made? People get paid to do it?

        "review_detailed_main": "For a comedy, then \"The Love Guru\" is surprisingly devoid of laughs and genuinely funny situations. Compared to previous Mike Myers movies, then this was a rather stale installment in his filmography.\n\nThe story is about guru Pitka (played by Mike Myers) who travels to USA in order to settle a romantic issue between Darren Roanoaks (played by Romany Mallo) and his girlfriend Prudence (played by Meagan Good). Without their love-life in alignment Darren is unable to play well in the hockey matches.\n\nThe laughs were scarce and far apart. I actually think that I laughed only a single time, and it was when Verne Troyer was defibrilated and was sent gliding along the ice arena.\n\nWhile lacking laughs, then the movie was rich on colorful characters who were portrayed by an impressively array of acting talents. Most memorable in the entire movie was the guru Tugginmypudha played by Ben Kingsley.\n\n\"The Love Guru\" is not a memorable movie, and not one of Myers best moments. The movie is suitable for a viewing once or twice, but doesn't really holds enough contents to support multiple viewings.\n\nI had expected more of a comedy from this movie. Especially with the impressive cast ensemble. Sadly, the movie turned out to be less than mediocre.\n\nOh, and before I forget; the best part of \"The Love Guru\" was the fact that they used Mariska Hargitay as a blessing or something. That was just a stroke of genius. And even better was it when she actually showed up."

You know, you have to watch this movie on a 3d degree level. I am sure that the subject, treating disrespectfully hinduism tru their gurus, can create a tsunami in these so called good consciences of stincky followers. But let me tell you that's good. You never heard a real guru. What myers do is just 0.5 percent of the fun or angriness ofa real guru. So don't be offended or laughing too much. I can feel this movie was calibrated, and they could have done much much more.. No guru should ever consider himself as important or useful. Yes, that seems contradictory to his so called job. But what is his job? Egoness, illusion and teaching of reality. We are here in a critic of famous TV gurus. Our Guru in the movie is so infatuated, he loves to receive attention, he loves to help others (what more egoistic than that) and he wants to be guru number one on oprah show. Then a woman and a coach contact him to help one of their player gain confidence. And he will...I found this movie touching, funny, non serious. And scratching the As s of these so called gurus who take advantage of people and their money, building vast usless ashrams or castles. There is rhythm in the movie and good ending. I left with a smile and wrote a letter to my parents telling them I love them. If it's not a proof. Well I know nobody will never read this review and the movie is out for a long time now.

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, um\u0085.it's not as bad as it looks. But let's face it, it looks awful.\n\nMyers portrays Guru Pitka, an American-born/Indian-raised new-age spiritualist. He strives to be the next Deepak Chopra. Chopra is his childhood friend and both Chopra and Pitka study under the same guru. In an early scene, Myers plays Pitka as a 12-year old in what has to be the creepiest usage of CGI since John Wayne was posthumously forced to shill for Coors. (But it could have been worse\u0085it could have been Coors Light.) Pitka is hired by the Toronto Maple Leafs' owner Jane Bullard (played by Jessica Alba) to help their lovelorn star player Darren Roanoke (played by Romany Malco) get his game face back so they can win the Stanley Cup. The rest of the movie exists primarily for Myers to riff on New Age platitudes and make dirty jokes.\n\nMyers take on the Eastern-based philosophy is an interesting conundrum. He seems to simultaneously be making fun of it AND have a fondness/belief in it. The movie is a tad schizophrenic in this regard. It can be hard to tell whether Myers thinks this is all rubbish or if he has a deep abiding belief in material of this sort. Seeing as how the real Deepak Chopra makes a cameo in the film, I tend to think it's the latter. But if that's the case, the jokes undermining the philosophy seem out of place. And some of the jokes are actually quite biting. For instance, there is a running gag where Pitka has \"profound\" statements that spell out acronyms, all of which are quickly followed by a \"TM\" trademark. Surely Jesus, Allah and/or Buddah never trademarked their beliefs to ensure they profited from the spread of their message. So the implication in the joke is that Pitka (and his ilk) is/are hucksters. But that is certainly not the overriding message of the film. While his character is seeking the fame of an Oprah appearance, with the exception of a brief lapse of judgment in the third act, he seems to have a very real concern for the outcome of the people he helps. And even that \"lapse of judgment\" consists of him taking a shortcut when helping someone, not him being malicious or underhanded.\n\nI imagine that this must be what it's like for people to watch \"Night At The Roxbury\" or \"The Ladies Man\" if they had never seen an episode of \"Saturday Night Live\". Mike Myers clearly spent a lot of time and effort developing this character. So much so that the jokes often feel like they are referencing things that we're already supposed to be fond of. And while it isn't the fiasco that the trailers make it look like, the best it can seem to muster is to be mildly amusing. The jokes can get so juvenile that when you do laugh, it's almost in spite of yourself. If it's a guilty pleasure, it's more \"guilty\" than \"pleasure\".\n\nAs for the supporting cast, Jessica Alba has virtually nothing to do in this movie except gaze lovingly at Myers. But, unless she's never seen any of his other films, this couldn't have been a shock. And to add insult to injury, Myers character has taken a vow of chastity so she can barely even achieve the level of \"love interest\" status. Romany Malco does a fine job but is essentially the straight man. He's there to set-up Myers and, of course, gaze lovingly at him\u0085in a \"manly\" way of course. Verne Troyer, of Mini-Me fame, plays the Maple Leafs' coach. And, while I'm sure he's happy to have the work, he seems to exist solely for Myers/Pitka to make \"midget\" jokes. Of course, that's got to be better than another a season of the \"Surreal Life\"\u0085but not by much. On the upside, at no point in the film does Troyer have to gaze lovingly at Myers.\n\nIf there's anything movies like \"Superbad\" and \"Knocked Up\" have taught us, it's that a movie can be raunchy and still be smart. This movie has much of the desperate \"love me/laugh at me\" feel of later era Jerry Lewis films.\n\nIt's never a good sign when the biggest laugh in the film comes during the outtakes that roll during the credits. It's even worse when that outtake doesn't even have your star in the shot. This movie is not bad enough to be horrible but it's not good enough to be great (or even good for that matter).\n\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being \"Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery\" and 1 being \"Cat In The Hat\", \"The Love Guru\" gets a 5."

Mike Myers didn't do as good as he could have. Jessica Alba and Megan Good kind of saved the movie and the acting. I think their were just way to many crude and mean scenes. They made fun of midgets in this movie and cross eyed people a lot. Their was a ton of sexual and crude humor. Everything thing that came out of Mike Myers mouth in this was either a phrase or something perverted. I guess he did deliver a few laughs here and there. For the most part though to stupid and dumb to be a good movie. It wasn't a horrible movie but not good either. It was overall just above average. Definitely not a movie I recommend to kids to go see. A lot more movies are getting more sexual and still getting pg-13 ratings. I think it was an original story and okay. For everything else though unoriginal and not to funny. The beginning started off slow and you find yourself waiting to see the outcome and it takes a while but it does. So it does kind of pick up after a slow start. I think that mostly only Mike Myers fans will enjoy this one. If you want a sexual and dirty jokes type of movie then go see this. If you want a serious adult and classic funny go see something else."

And, based on the other reviews, I think I'm the only one who does. I'll start this review off by stating the bad things, and then I'll talk about the good things.\n\nGuru Pitka singing 9 to 5 seemed pretty unnecessary, as was his rendition of Space Cowboy. I mean, I get that Pitka's first name is Maurice, but still. Not needed. Some of the jokes were a little immature, too. Half of the penis jokes, short jokes, \"I'm making diarrhea sounds with my cup\", and stuff like that. Some of the short jokes were funny, but I'll get to that later...Okay, it's later. On to the good things.\n\nStephen Colbert and that other guy who's name escapes me were the highlight of the film. They have the funniest scenes. Justin Timberlake was hilarious as his character, as well. Jessica Alba looked very pretty, like usual and John Oliver was great, too. And, even the most avid of Love Guru haters have to admit that the More Than Words sequence, while generally unneeded, was really pleasant to listen to. Whoever played Raj has a really good voice. Mike Myers also has some really funny scenes, as well. The Pitka vs Rooster scene was one of the funniest, to me.\n\nThis isn't Myers' best movie by any means, but it isn't his worst either. 7/10"

Kings goalie Jacques 'Le Coq' Grand\u00e9 (Justin Timberlake). Team owner Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba) hires Guru Pitka (Mike Myers) for $2 million to fix Roanoke. Pitka wants to be the next Deepak Chopra. He doesn't get along with the diminutive coach Punch Cherkov (Verne Troyer).\n\nMike Myers makes a mistake right from the start by putting this as a Toronto Maple Leafs story. On top of that, Guru Pitka is a bad SNL skit. If Myers had tried this on SNL, he would have realized its inherent problems and abandoned the idea. It is borderline racist and worst of all, it's not funny. The only funny bits happen with Troyer if I stretch to be kind. Alba and Malco are terribly bland. Guru Pitka could be a funny character if he's an innocent and naive to the modern world. He's not likable and the comedy is repetitive."

        "review_title": "Myers Flails as a Chopak Wannabe in a Comic Misfire",
        "review_detailed_main": "Star and co-writer Mike Myers is far too clever to be dismissed entirely for a film burdened by his kitchen-sink approach to comedy. However, this 2008 film comes closest to making him downright intolerable despite a smattering of smart one-liners that barely save it from landing in the junk bin. The concept would seem ripe with possibilities as the film lampoons the commercial intentions of self-help gurus like Deepak Chopra, but Myers and his writing partner Graham Gordy appear more interested in bodily functions, gross-out humor, repetitive gags (\"Mariska Hargitay\"), Canadian in-jokes, and celebrity walk-ons rather than keep the satirical aspects focused enough to make a point. Unfortunately, first-time director Marco Schnabel simply lets the star and the rest of the lackluster cast flounder without lending a perspective that could have balanced the lowbrow shenanigans with the highbrow aspirations. As unsatisfying as the film is, I wonder if Judd Apatow could have saved this material.\n\nThe overextended plot revolves around self-help guru Maurice Pitka, who was born in America but raised in India. With his long hair and beard and traditional Hindu garb, Pitka is known as a second-rate Chopra, but he is aggressively looking for an opportunity to change that and get on the Oprah Winfrey Show. Enter Darren Roanoke, star player for the Toronto Maple Leafs, who goes into a scoring slump just as the team makes the Stanley Cup playoffs. Team owner Jane Bullard and coach Punch Cherkov seek out Pitka to help Roanoke reconcile with his wife Prudence, who has caused his beleaguered lack of self-esteem. She has decided to leave him for the conjugal joys to be had with Jacques \"Le Coq\" Grande, the goalie for the opposing Los Angeles Kings known for his elephantine endowment. Pitka espouses his radical \"DRAMA\" method of enlightenment to alleviate Roanoke's stress and lead him on a journey toward self-love. Apparently that's the only chance that the Maple Leafs have in winning the Cup. At the same time, Pitka realizes his goal to usurp Chopak is a hollow one when he becomes romantically drawn to the comely Bullard.\n\nMyers may have gone to the well one too many times with his smarmy, overly self-aware performance as Pitka. What goodwill he generated as Wayne Campbell and Austin Powers has almost evaporated here. As Bullard, Jessica Alba is a pretty but unavoidably wooden foil to Myers, and her character's attraction to Pitka remains one of the film's bigger mysteries. Somewhat better is Romany Malco as Roanoke and Justin Timberlake as Grande, though neither is imposing enough to be particularly believable as professional hockey players. As a more verbal version of Mini-Me, Verne Troyer plays Cherkov in constant foul-mouthed agitation. The most embarrassing performance, however, belongs to a cross-eyed Ben Kingsley as Pitka's spiritual mentor, Guru Tugginmypudha. I doubt if any other Oscar winner has taken quite as discreet a fall from grace. On the other hand, I have to admit I liked the sitar revamp of Dolly Parton's \"9 to 5\" as the irrelevant opening theme, as well as Stephen Colbert's funny bits with Jim Gaffigan as the play-by-play commentators. But that's about it.\n\nThe extras are abundant on the 2008 DVD if you care to view them. First, there is a standard making-of featurette, \"Mike Myers and The Love Guru - An Inside Look\" that runs ten minutes with comments from Myers, Alba, Troyer, and Schnabel. There is a six-minute short, \"One Helluva Elephant\", showing how special effects specialist Ron Stefaniuk built an animatronic elephant and ostrich for the movie. More interesting is \"Hockey Training for Actors\" which has sports coordinator Mark Ellis explaining how the actors learned to play hockey. Rounding out the extras are eleven deleted/extended scenes, a four-minute blooper reel, a separate five-minute compilation of deleted takes with Colbert and Gaffigan (the best of the extras and even better than the movie), ten minutes more of general outtakes, and the original theatrical trailer."

Jessica Alba is so pretty, everything is in its place as it should be. A movie must be continually interesting, to keep your attention all the time, not to have some slow parts, and this movie hasn't any. If you ask me, I recommend this movie, it is full of jokes, all the time, and I really don't know how somebody can say that it is nothing but a bad movie of Myer's. It is just like the other movies of his. Maybe even better. Personally, I've seen it at least 10 times, it is so 'bad'."

Eddie Murphy, Robin Williams and now Mike Myers. All these guys need new material and good scripts to get their careers back on track. Please do not go back to Austin Powers, that series has been dried up and The Love Guru is just a rejected character from other ideas. Mike, you're a funny guy, let's see it eh? Jessica Alba does noting here, she is not funny and doesn't use her 'assets' to make me interested. I think she was actually relying on her 'acting' skills on this one. I never thought I would actually ever say this but, I was happy to see Justin Timberlake in this. He had some good moments of comedy, a lot funnier then Myers. Mike, the former N*Sync boy toy just stole the film from you.\n\nMyers uses same old material, recycled and coming from a different 'approach'. You know how Goldmember used the same jokes as The Spy Who Shagged Me? Same stuff here, just in a different format. More short jokes at mini-me, more sexual innuendos with names and a wink at the camera here and there. Same old stuff we've seen before.\n\nThe scenes where the characters are playing hockey aren't even that good. They don't represent the game in any sense of realism. Guys are spinning and flipping everywhere. Usually sport scenes are thrilling, this one was a joke. The funniest bit involved the one and only VAL KILMER, who is in it for 5 seconds.\n\nI guess if you think two elephants doing it is funny, then you'll enjoy this. for everyone else, just keep on keeping on.\n\nWhat a horrible way to start the year off."

I know that Myers movie are not reputed for their subtle jokes and sense of good taste, but this one is the worst of all. Then, the story : if I say that its annoying story, that nothing really happens, and the viewer never surprised, I would still be far from the infamous truth. The acting is quite bad too, the characters have no personality, and Myers omnipresence, surely the fact of his gigantic ego, doesn't help the viewer to have a better experience.\n\nAs a conclusion: run, fast!"

It's not very well written or anything but the sheer amount of gags means you'll laugh occasionally. Similar to the likes of the Zucker brothers, the film has a stick to the wall feeling and it's almost the last of these types of comedies in a way.\n\nThe acting is weak generally but from a solely comedy point of view, there are much worse movies."

        "review_detailed_main": "For the life of me I don't understand how reviewers have given Zohan and Get Smart better overall average star ratings than this movie. Of the three this flick has the most laughs. Of course the topic of this movie : new-age pseudo middle eastern self help spirituality is a big pill to swallow. I believe that this movie suffered bad reviews for several reasons that actually had nothing to do with whether it was well done or not.\n\nIn explanation of this I will offer several thoughts. 1)The main character is a white guy with obvious ethnic / cultural trappings.This I believe made it harder for audiences to relate to. We need to have lead characters clearly defined in their nationality and other aspects of their character. Guru Pitka admittedly was a bit ambiguous.Was he supposed to be East Indian? This ethnic group not nearly as \"cool\"as being black or Hispanic,was not warmly embraced by north American audiences to be sure. As one friend asked me , \"Is he supposed to be East Indian?\" Ah no he is not.So for the majority of the public the character went right over their heads. This I believed is the source of the controversy that was stirred up when it was released. Is this a parody of East Indian culture? No it is not. On to my next point. 2)This movie due to its subject matter,a parody of pseudo psychology/mysticism that was so the rage in the early 90s. Unfortunately those who were into this pop phenomenon took it all to seriously.This is the problem , those who would \"get\" most of the jokes would not go to see this movie. With their politically correct spiritually righteous mentality,this movie might come across as an affront to their belief systems.\n\nI was into some of the new age stuff in the day but never took it so serious as to let it erode my sense of humor. But in some ways unless you were into this scene a lot of the humor comes across as an bunch of \"inside jokes\" only some might get. You couldn't swing a dead cat in say 1995 without hitting some up and coming self help guru hawking their latest book. This is where the humor truly lies in this movie. The Love Guru stands up not only as a great parody of time past but also as a social satire with its roots in the last decade.\n\nOf course it is a very typical Mike Myers as it has its fair share of goofy slapstick gags and crude humor. Their are some fantastic one liners that actually noticed only on subsequent viewings. I found Myers played the character with warmth and genuine love for the material. This often put over a lot of the more lame jokes as there certainly are more than a few. But hey isn't that what a Mike myers movie is supposed to be ? Jokes so inanely silly that that is what makes them roar out loud funny.Come on now Austin Powers,Shrek and Waynes World were the same style. Yet amazingly enough so many reviewers state that is what ruined this movie.Personally I love a comedy that uses the a joke so bad its funny approach,truly this being for me the charm of Mike Myers past efforts.\n\nI am not sure what people expected. I personally wish it would have done better in the box office as I would love to see sequels. Hey maybe Guru Pitka can \"co-star\" with Austin Powers(you know help him get his mojo back)as the character is one of the finest Myers has created.I believe the character should get more mileage. But I think the nuances of Guru Pitka went over the average movie goers heads. This is sad as it doesn't reflect on the quality of the movie but more so on how far the average movie goers sense of humor has slipped.\n\nI am thinking that had this movie been released ten years ago in 1998 it would have been a huge hit and critically praised. This movie's only crime being it is a bit behind the times topically speaking. I truly believe in the future this movie will be lauded as a unrecognized classic. Hey Deepak loved the movie and thought it was very entertaining.As for the majority of bad reviewers who stated this movie was nothing more than a string of penis jokes,I have to wonder if they even watched the same movie.Yes, granted there is the fair share of crude humor ,what comedy doesn't go that route these days. Like Jackass is high concept.\n\nJustinb Timberlake as a french Canadian hockey player in love with Celine Dion was bust a gut hilarious. I think he should give up singing and concentrate on being a comedic actor,he was that good. Myers pulls out every type of joke from \"potty humor\" to the Vaudvillian style \"take my wife please\" variety. All in all this movie is near perfect goofy comedy and absolutely does not deserve the almost universal beat down it has received. I have bought this movie and probably seen it now 10 times and will probably enjoy 10 more."

The costumes were good,and the sets were also nice. BUT THE ENTIRE PHILOSOPHY OR STORY OF THE MOVIE IS CRAPPINESS @ its best! The movie's genre is comedy and the only ones who get the laughs r characters inside the movie,they laugh for whatever mike myers says,and it looks pathetic! Jessica looks great in the Indian dress and some sound tracks made using sitar(Indian music instrument) was also OK. JESSICA ALBA LOOKS MIND BLOWINGLY GREAT in this movie and i wont hesitate to watch it again just for her,period. Don't waste your time on this,life's got lots to enjoy!cheers!"

The plot is paper thin and the jokes are groan-worthy and extremely surface level. Basically every joke in this movie falls into one of three categories. Mike Myers saying something in an Indian accent, dick jokes, or Verne Troyer is small.\n\nI hated every minute of this, it's no surprise that this movie was apparently written during a writers strike because the comedy writing is just so low effort and lame. This is one of the worst comedies I've ever seen. It's no wonder we haven't seen much of Mike Myers since."

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't know what everyone is complaining about. I've seen that it's getting bad reviews and I don't know why.\n\nMike Myers plays Guru Pitka (\"The Love Guru\") who is always playing second fiddle to Deepak Chopra. So in an attempt to get the recognition he seeks he takes on the task of helping the star of the Toronto Maple Leafs, played by Romany Malco, whose personal problems are effecting his game during the championships.\n\nSo the film mixes the kind of advice you'd get in all the self-help books from people like Deepak Chopra with jokes. So it's kinda making fun of it, but it isn't because it shows that the advice is pretty good, but it's still funny. I'm actually someone who has read a lot of those books and maybe you have to be to get how hilarious Guru Pitka is. But he's also Mike Myers and if you don't like Myers, you should probably know that by now, and shouldn't be seeing this movie. If you do like him however, I can't see a real reason why you wouldn't like it. Justin Timberlake has a small role as the opposing goalie, who is causing a great deal of Romany Malco's character's stress. Timberlake's sorta funny but kinda overdid it.\n\nThe film has some bathroom humor but not as much as you normally see in a Mike Myers film. It's much more about self-esteem and overcoming your baggage in order to succeed. I know it's a silly comedy but that stuff is in there. I guess people wouldn't want to take kids to it, because of some sexual humor, but otherwise I thought it was really funny and laughed throughout."

He used \"Mariska Hargitay,\" as a greeting and she showed up at one point, which was cute on her part.\n\nIf you like Mike Myers or any of his previous movies, then you'll love this one too.

I personally never thought Mike Myers was funny, and this movie really shows it. He looks like he's uncomfortable doing his own stupid lines and jokes, as does everyone else in the film. There's a lot of dead air in the movie as well, just a lot of quiet with not much happening but silly dialogue. The penis jokes got old fast, almost as if Mike Myers has a fetish. The including of Verne Troyer was a novelty that just didn't work. In fact most things in this movie just didn't work. The couple highlights: It was nice seeing current and former Daily Show players on here (Stephen Colbert, John Oliver, and even Samantha Bee for a second), too bad none of them were given anything funny to say. The scene with Mike Myers and Kanye West together at the game was an interesting idea, but was obviously tacked on, they didn't even say anything. And um, Jessica Alba is still hot. That's about it."

I don't even know how was this was okay to put in theaters, in fact some of the comedy is so cringe, I really believe nobody should watch this abomination , and forget it, watch something better by Mike myers, because this movie is nothing but junk, just junk.

        "review_title": "Guru Pitka is a less likable version of Austin Powers.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Of all things about this mess of a movie, the most surprising to me was the character of Guru Pitka. I thought he would be a silly character, but one who cared about others. He was surprisingly more crude and horny than Austin Powers, and the character, and Mike Meyers himself, just couldn't stay away from the wiener jokes. I took a count on how many male genital jokes were in this film, and I came up with 39, which means every 2 minutes there was a genital joke, which shows how far Mike Meyers was stretching for a script.\n\nGuru Pitka (Mike Meyers) is a self help guru who focuses mainly on people's love lives, and gives stupid seminars in which he uses mnemonics for his multi-step programs that usually spell out dirty words. Pitka is living in the shadow of a rival guru Deepak Chopra, and more than anything, Pitka wants to get on Oprah so he can become a more respected guru. He tries to help a hockey player Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco), who's marriage is on the rocks, to get publicity. The manager of the team died a few years back and his daughter Jane (Jessica Alba) is running the team now. Pitka both falls for her and wants to help her self esteem. Bad jokes ensue.\n\nThere are so many negatives to this film, and very few positives, but there are positives, and this isn't the worst movie I've ever seen. In fact, this isn't even the worst of the year. Meet the Spartans was worse, and this was a treat compared to that. But nonetheless, I'll start with the negatives here. The characters are just awful. As I've said, Pitka was very unlikable and acted like an annoying 12 year old. Justin Timberlake was obnoxious as a rival hockey player who was dating Darren's wife. Every joke based around him has to do with the size of his privates...funny, huh!? Verne Troyer aka Mini Me plays the Hockey Coach and he was better when he didn't talk much. Steven Colbert is seen throughout as a hockey announcer, and though he can be funny, he needs the right material to play off of, and this is not it. Ben Kingsley plays my favorite character, who's name is so long I don't want to spell it out. He plays Pitka's mentor is flashbacks back in India, and though he's not funny, Kingsley just has a presence that no one else in this sorry picture could even try to emulate. His character is pretty similar to Mike Meyers in View from the Top, so he's really not bringing much new to the table, unfortunately. We also are treated to some really random cameos, like Jessica Simpson, Kanye West, Mariska Hargitay and the very random Val Kilmer. What an eclectic group they have. The direction is okay, but it doesn't really matter, because it's the writing that does this one in. Mike Meyers wanted to play Austin Powers again I guess, so he created an Indian carnation of him that manages to be a lot less funny, more crude, and dare I say, a character that's even more sex starved.\n\nOnto the positives. There were a few moments where I laughed, and they were generally ones after long sustain periods of boredom, and the scenes caught me by surprise because they were mildly amusing. The acting isn't bad, the characters are, so the acting is a positive. I was mildly entertained at moments throughout, but overall this was just a horribly written mess that relied way too little on brain, and way too much on jokes about the male second brain. I found Pitka's appearance on the season finale of American idol funnier than anything in this movie.\n\nMy rating: * out of ****. 85 mins. PG-13 for sexual humor, drug use and language"

Its the new Myers film, if you don't like Wienerjokes or Myke Myers who imitating Peters Selllers in \"the Party\" WHY YOU GO WATCHING THIS MOVIE AND WRITE ON IMDb ABOUT IT. The problem is not \"the love Guru\" its YOU. Is your Wiener not long enough to do it on your own? I dislike Adam Sandler he's probably the dullest comedian of all times, but American people love his stupidity and pay a lot for it, and this dumb Sparta movie. I hate that crap, so i don't watch it or write about. You want to write about every movie you don't like? Or with the Gurus own words. Stop writing about things you don't like. Why are you still writing about things you don't like. Stop it and play with your wiener.\n\nIf you like Myers Movies like Austin Powers check it out, it was funny but hes not a wise Guru.

Nothing too insane but there are some funny Bollywood-esque dance scenes that come about randomly.\n\nCharacters/Acting- Mike Myers is great as ever, Verne Troyer makes a return, Alba's always a nice touch, Timberlake is a spaz. Overall goofy but still far from intolerable.\n\nWriting- Honestly I remember alot of the acronyms the guru makes up, the piss mop scene, Kanye West randomly appearing as a hockey fan. It's very similar to Austin Powers in style, but those films are far much better.\n\nQuality- It's got funny music scenes, it's not poorly edited, I mean it's a good goofy comedy. I don't understand the hate. I'd say the movie Get Hard is a totally unfunny movie, in general as well as in comparison. Just an example.\n\nOverall it's a good goofy film, if you're willing to watch one. Seriously, don't listen to the hate."

That's not to say that this movie must be watched more than once in order to understand its 'hidden message', but that it is one that comes in under the radar.\n\nThis movie only recently popped back into my head and like I said, it's been a while, so I am essentially working off the essence that it left behind, hidden somewhere between my heart and my gut. However, it is through this essence that I realized that I loved this movie the first time that I saw it, even if I didn't understand why at the time.\n\nThis movie isn't making fun of people who are 'spiritual', 'religious' or even 'those who seek enlightenment through self-improvement movements'. What it does seem to be doing is gently mocking (whilst wearing a grin) our natural tendencies to attach ourselves to labels, images and ideas that we think will help to define us. This includes our quest to 'find' happiness.\n\nWhat this movie is saying is that if you want to be happy then just be that. Be happy. It really is that simple and Mike Myer's character reflects this in everything he does on screen, not least of which is he himself being humbled.\n\nYes, even 'gurus' can make mistakes. Yet this flawed, immature, goof-ball of a man is the living embodiment of happiness throughout the movie.\n\nHmmmmm. You see? Now he has you thinking..."

The humor feels forced and outdated, relying on clich\u00e9s and crass punchlines that don't land as intended.\n\nWhat makes this even more disappointing is the presence of talented actors like Jessica Alba, whose charm and skill are utterly wasted in this project. Jessica's role is underdeveloped and fails to utilize her full potential as an actress. It's frustrating to see such a gifted performer caught in a film that doesn't give her much to work with.\n\nThe movie's attempts at parody and satire are clunky and uninspired, leaving little to salvage. Instead of being the laugh-out-loud comedy it aimed to be, The Love Guru ends up feeling like an awkward and overly long sketch.\n\nThis film had the potential to explore deeper humor or even be a clever parody, but instead, it settles for cheap laughs and squandered talent. Unfortunately, it's a hard pass unless you're looking for an example of how not to execute a comedy."

And this movie gets it. Aside form the fact that it obviously pokes fun at how many people get grifted by televangelists and new age gurus the world over, it also tries to redeem the hearts of people to not lose sight of whatever might be most important to them. One does not need to follow the doctrine or life of another unless they want to risk losing themselves to obscurity and sorrow. But sometimes, because of how brainwashed and vapid modern people are, the point has to be gotten across with some quasi \"childish\" or, dare I say, youthful humor.

He does weave a few jokes and scenes from his past projects, but they work and are still funny. Some would say they are a tribute to his other films that we love.\n\nWith all that said there were a few scenes that went on with out humor. Stephen Colbert's scenes were not funny and too long. I like Colert but he was handed or improved lines that did not work. Justin Timberlake was good and had a couple of good lines. Vern Troyer was great and very funny. Jessica Alba has one great scene with the fans but is mostly eye candy (one eyed candy Shwing!).\n\nMeyers has another franchise on his hands. Leave your troubles, see the movie, Laugh Out Loud, and forgive the few missteps."

This movie didn't try to have an Oscar-winning script- it is just a fun, silly movie and was marketed as such. My fellow movie-goers and I were continually snickering and often burst out in laughter. This movie doesn't deserve the awful hype it's been trashed with. It was no artful masterpiece, but I feel that it fulfilled its job in being able to make us laugh."

Those people have to get their heads out of their a$$'s and lighten up! this movie was great, I started laughing 2 minutes in, if that, and it continued all the way to the end. Myers was great, his sidekick was good, the hockey player that you don't even see or hear about in the previews is great and Alba is good and good to look at too....vern is so funny too.

I didn't think it was as funny as Austin Powers but since Mike Myers played the Austin Powers role well and that all three movies were such big hits, I think that everyone believes that Mike Myers has to reach that level with every movie he makes. The Love Guru however is somewhat of a different approach in Myers career. The movie is not only about a Guru and the Toronto Maple Leafs, it also has a bit of a romantic storyline from two points of view but I won't ruin it if you intend on seeing it. Verne Troyer also adds to the humour with a number of hilarious acts he performs in the movie. I also found it interesting that Mike Myers was able to use the LA Kings, Toronto Maple Leafs and Hockey Night in Canada in the film. That was one aspect I found to allow like the film even more since I watch hockey on CBC. This film is also viewed as controversial due to the humorous aspects of the Guru. Films like Borat and Passion of the Christ are viewed as controversial and are some of the best films of all time so to give the Love Guru negative reviews due to the controversy involved does not really make sense. The Love Guru has a great storyline and even though it may be a bit far fetched at times, make your own decision and don't just listen to the reviews and the critics.\n\n10/10"

The scene in his office is hysterical, watch for it. You will absolutely love the opening of the movie and the song they sing. The all-star cameos will surprise you as well, and Jacque's favorite singer is someone every viewer will recognize. Jessica Alba was actually quite good in a comedy - I was pleasantly surprised! Absolutely the funniest summer popcorn movie so far this year!!! I love Mike Myers and his genius mind! \"Mariska Hargitay\"!"

I don't watch a movie to waste $9.00 and pick all the bad things out.\n\nThe best part about The Love Guru is the Guru Pitka. A totally self-absorbed, childish Guru who only cares about becoming better than Deepak Chopra. Meyers delivers a great performance, always in perfect character, with the right emphasis on every situation. Alba shines as the beautiful Jane Bullard, just a decoration for the male audience to ogle. Verne Troyer is great as the perverted, agitated Coach Punch Cherkov. Justin Timberlake is absolutely spot on as Jacques \"Le Coq\" Grande, the well-endowed goalie for the L.A. Kings.\n\nThe movie, as you will find out, is very touching.

I admit Jessica Alba's acting is a bit wooden, but who cares. And the mop fight scene actually was pretty disgusting.\n\nBut Mike Myers has created a delightful character here. It is a great parody of the new-age/guru industry, without being actually denigrating. The humour is at times of the so-bad-it's-good genre, with the delivery lifting it from plain groaner to irrepressible guffaw. It's a run of gags and puns and double entendres all the way, and part of the fun is seeing how high he can stack them.\n\nThe production values are first-rate; it's lovely to watch. The Bollywood parodies make for multicultural novelty, and are a total romp.\n\nThere's plenty of star wattage. Justin Timberlake is perfect as the Quebecois blowhard goalie. And Ben Kingsley as the cross-eyed Guru Tugginmypudha \u0097 come on, give yourself a break. That's funny!\n\nI've seen dreck, and this ain't it."

This is low-brow, basic humour, pitched at those who want for no more than a good laugh.\n\nI tend to think that there is an element of bias here against a culture that the majority of Americans are ignorant about. Perhaps instead, it is because a Canadian team got the better of an American team that sticks in the craw somewhat? (I am neither).\n\nClearly, ignorance abounds. This was a funny movie and tried to be nothing more than that. Leave your prejudice at home, get to the theatre and laugh out loud. I did."

Penises can be short! Penises can be long! Oh, hahaha! Oh, and who can forget the musical numbers. Did I mention that they were choreographed? Mike Myers has lost the charm he exhibited in the Austin Powers franchise. And it's clear that he picked an inexperienced director for this so he could control the shoot. And why does Jessica Alba keep doing crappy movies like this and \"Good Luck, Chuck\"? Did someone tell her she was a comedienne? And Justin Timberlake -- well, no wonder he wears a wig and moustache throughout. Ironically, though the material is definitely for teen-aged boys, they probably won't go to see it because of the title. It'll maybe have one weekend, then go flaccid. Incidentally, the only truly memorable line in the entire mess is from Verne Troyer in an outtake run with the credits. But it's not worth watching the entire mess to hear it."

Back then, the media had a lot of pull, much like today, but the media has been exposed.\n\nLong story short this movie is good and funny and deserves, DESERVES to be watched. It's smart and funny. Myers plays a Guru, but he isn't a phony. He's the real deal and hilarious. He needs to save someone from essentially thinking his life has been a disappointment. It a lot more thoughtful and hilarious than I described.\n\nHighly recommended especially in the humorless 2020's."

Just a silly movie! It's the kind of movie that you shouldn't watch if you're expecting something great, or if you're too much of a serious person.\n\nIt's great as just a light movie, if you just feel like watching something that's not serious at all, with a few laughs; but overall, when you ignore the lame jokes, there's that nice storyline: reuniting loved ones, making new friends, and learning how to be a better person and standing up for yourself etc.\n\nI gave this movie an 8/10 because I loved laughing at the lame jokes and not having to think about dramatic stuff (Don't go thinking I can't love the serious movies, because I definitely can, but I don't write the silly movies off either). The whole Indian theme in the movie made it unique and funny as well - like it was trying to be some bollywood film. I loved the actors... Mike Myers laugh just made me laugh all the time; and mini-me dude was awesome as well. Justin Timberlake was horrible acting as some french-Canadian guy but it fit well with the movie, and I just sat there laughing at his acting.\n\nSo like I said: it's not a 'serious' comedy, and don't expect too much from it; but it's great just as a silly, lame movie that you can watch when you're not in a serious-movie mood, and have a few laughs occasionally."

        "review_detailed_main": "I think the problem is not that the movie is \"juvenile\" or \"self indulgent\", but rather that so many of the reviewers here are! If you don't like comedy, then why the hell are you writing a review on a Mike Myers film? The point of \"The Love Guru\" is to make you laugh, not to win Academy Awards. If your goal in watching it is to laugh, then unless you have no sense of humo(u)r, you can't go wrong with the Love Guru. I was laughing so much I had to pause the DVD a few times -- it is absolutely hilarious, I found it much more consistently funny than any of the austin powers movies that all the amateur movie reviewers here probably fell over themselves trying to get to their iphones to type glowing reviews for. Furthermore, I'd say it's LESS self-indulgent and LESS potty humor oriented than austin powers (which isn't to say there isn't plenty of both -- there is - if you don't love scatological humor then why the hell would you watch Mike Myers??). The real problem is perhaps that it takes on \"spiritual\" subjects with hilarious results, which will perhaps hit people a bit too close to home...\n\nThere are so many hilarious references to sports, to the \"self improvement\" world, to Indian culture, there is a lot to like here. I think the movie is a bit ahead of it's time, it will perhaps be better liked in 5 years than now. But don't be dissuaded by bad reviews from people that don't really enjoy comedy or possess an actual sense of humor -- check it out for yourself! But leave your ego at the door, and enjoy it for what it is."

It reminds me more of a kooky new age cult than any specific religion. But even so, every other religion and ethnicity has been subject to comedic parody of one sort of another.

There are a few very over the top films, but criticizing Mike Myers for being eccentric is like criticizing Quentin Tarantino for being overly dramatic.

I had never heard of Deepak Chopra or Mariska Hargitay before seeing the film and wouldn't recognize Oprah Winfrey if I were seated across from her. Mike Myers's Guru Pitka character is not likable or sympathetic and the romantic angle is not credible in the least, although Jessica Alba seems entirely sincere. Many of the jokes are insipid, some of the homoerotic humor is cringeworthy and a few jokes are pushed too far. But the film offers an abundance of humor at various levels. Ten minutes of this film offers more gags than many comedies offer in their entire length. I especially enjoyed the pop tunes played out of context, the music/dance numbers, the parody of Bollywood films, Ben Kingsley, the sportscasters, Verne Troyer's office, the animal travel cages and the notion of Canadian hockey team dependent on a black superstar. Other parts were extremely stupid, such as the cotton candy, Judi Dench and yoga bits. But there are more than enough gags that hit the mark or reasonably close to overlook the enthusiastic and energetic efforts that fell flat."

Absolutely.\n\nIt seems like people take movies so seriously these days that they forget how to watch a movie just for the fun of it. Granted, this movie will probably appeal more to men than women, but there's plenty of naughty chuckles for everyone. This movie is an odd, twisted conglomeration of Canadian Hockey and Eastern Mysticism, which is merely a loose framework on which Myers strings joke after joke, gag after gag, often taking the oldest jokes in the book and giving them new meaning and zing.\n\nI have hundreds of movies in my disc collection, and this is one of the very few that I can take out and watch over and over when I need a good laugh. I recommend taking a lazy afternoon to throw on this movie, particularly with a couple of good friends, pop open a beer and sit back for some extremely strange and goofy fun. You'll find yourself with plenty of quotable lines, unforgettable outrageous scenes and a smile on your face.\n\nWARNING: This movie is not for pucker-butts.

The Love Guru was pretty funny... unless you're a Grinch... at least in this movie Mike has good teeth. All what you might expect to see from a Mike Meyers film is there, sexual innuendos, conflict between good and bad... (or maybe that might be good and stupid?), corny one liners AND it even involves Hindu religion, no offense to Curry Kings.

If you aim low you will likely give this movie a 7 or above but if you are expecting another super bad Austin powers or even Napoleon dynamite you will likely give this a 3 or worse."

I'll admit there were a couple of jokes that were overplayed, the acronym and book title jokes did get a bit stale. But overall it was fun, the midget managers office complete with midget furniture, the fake heart attack followed by defibrillator application scene, the killer guard cock, all good.\n\nConservative types or people who just won't allow themselves to enjoy the moment probably won't like it. Joke 'em if they can't take a f*ck! Anyway I thought it was worth the price of admission. As with most Mike Myers films, I do think the film contains relevant valid social commentary."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'll admit I've seen this several times as a kid, and later became aware of its atrocious reputation. Many films from my childhood don't hold up through adult eyes, but upon this rewatch, I'm baffled by its reception.\n\nGuess I'm just a sucker for juvenile humour. The concept of a cartoonish, eccentric guru is inventive and amusing. The rapid succession of gags had me snickering consistently, though the cultural appropriation, portrayal of elephant riding, and some of the jokes, feel dated and in poor taste.\n\nMyers lost his father in 1991, and during a subsequent period of reflection and spiritual enlightenment, conceived the characters of Austin Powers and Guru Pitka. Fascinating that the former became a comedy icon which springboarded his career, and the latter derailed it. Also, what is it with Myers (Canadian - American) and accents / physical transformations? A Scottish ogre, British spy, adult - sized cat, and 'Indian' (inspired?) guru.\n\nMyers started workshopping the character in comedy clubs, and pulled out all the stops; surprising how many big names star or cameo in his passion project, which then crashed and burned.\n\nIt's fast - paced, and feels like a passionate, polished and cohesive vision that's presented with a lot of care. At the end of the day, I'd much rather watch a dumb, imperfect, 'guilty pleasure' comedy than a boring slog, and I feel I've seen hundreds of duller films than this one."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Love Guru, starring Mike Myers, is an underrated gem that often gets unfairly overshadowed by its initial negative reception. While the film didn't receive the warmest welcome upon its release in 2008, it is undeniably a hilarious and unique comedy that deserves a second look, especially for fans of Myers' iconic Austin Powers series.\n\nMike Myers shines in his role as Guru Pitka, bringing his trademark wit, charm, and over-the-top comedic style to the character. The movie's humor is delightfully absurd, much like the Austin Powers films, with a blend of slapstick, clever wordplay, and irreverent satire. The supporting cast, including Jessica Alba, Justin Timberlake, and Romany Malco, adds to the film's comedic strength with their enthusiastic and often hilarious performances. One of the movie's greatest strengths is its fearless approach to humor. It doesn't shy away from pushing boundaries and playing with outrageous scenarios, making it a riotous experience from start to finish. The visual gags, pun-filled dialogue, and eccentric characters create a comedic tapestry that keeps the laughs coming. While \"The Love Guru\" may have been dismissed by critics at the time, it's a movie that can surprise and entertain those willing to give it a chance. Much like the Austin Powers movies, it has the potential to become a cult classic, appreciated for its bold humor and the comedic genius of Mike Myers. If you enjoy irreverent comedies that don't take themselves too seriously, \"The Love Guru\" is definitely worth a watch."

If you want something with true substance, go watch a Meryl Streep movie. But if you want to just relax, have some good laughs and not take it all too seriously, then this movie is for you.

Not to mention some wonderful takes on Bollywood Music Videos.. Oh yes and both Jessica Alba and Justine Timberlake show excellent comedic talent along side the amazing Mike Myers."

It's truly a shame it got barraged with such negative reviews but it's good to see that some people on here agree with my friends and i on this one. It's not Austin Powers level funny but it does the trick. Just sit back, relax and enjoy some stupid comedy.
