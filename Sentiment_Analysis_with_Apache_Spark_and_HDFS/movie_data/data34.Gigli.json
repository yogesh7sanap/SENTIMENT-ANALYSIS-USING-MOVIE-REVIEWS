        "review_detailed_main": "I saw this movie and hated about 99% of it. After I found out it cost $54,000,000 to make, I started to hate the other 1%. If this is considered a love story between Lopez and Affleck, may I ask...where was the love? A sex scene with no nudity, no passion, and no sound....why? Supporting characters like Christopher Walken and others were introduced and went no where...why? The story alone peeks when Pacino arrives and shoots one of the cast members. From there, i was hoping that Pacino had finished the job and killed the rest of the cast. If that happened, the movie would have been good. Instead, the movie drags and drags and drags. The audience is not going to care if the actors in the movie learn something or progress if they don't care about the characters. Lopez and Affleck's characters do not exist! Much like the ugly tattoos on Affleck's shoulder, the movie was not fun to look at. In my opinion, and I do not think I am wrong, if Lopez had a small nude scene and / or the movie was done as an independent film for under 2 or 3 million, Gigli would have been a giant success. Instead, we are left to wonder....why?"

        "review_detailed_main": "Maybe one of the most notorious flops of the 21st century so far, Gigli is a movie I finally watched, and did so right after watching another famous \"bad\" movie from 2003, The Room.\n\nThe Room might have too many problems to keep track of them all, but it's a thoroughly engaging and funny watch, when you watch it at an interactive screening (as I've done about 10 times now). Gigli just doesn't have the magic that The Room does. For the most part, it's bad because almost all of its comedy flops, and it's just a weirdly lifeless, boring movie...\n\n...with a couple of exceptions, thanks to Christopher Walken and Al Pacino. They're both in the movie briefly for some reason, but each being an energy that's kind of compelling and fun. Walken especially might be the one thing preventing this from being truly irredeemable.\n\nI think it really has the reputation it does because of the talent involved, and the careers it sank, because reading about this on paper, you'd expect better. Beyond the cast, Martin Brest has made some very good films, particularly comparable crime-comedies like Beverley Hills Cop, Midnight Run, and the original/excellent/underrated Going In Style. Since Gigli's release in 2003, Brest hasn't made another movie, which is a shame. Unless of course he made a personal choice to retire from filmmaking, the idea that one bad movie should make you a filmmaking outcast isn't really fair.\n\nAnyway, watch the Walken and/or Pacino scenes on YouTube. Miss the rest. It's pretty dull and tedious, and probably has about 25 minutes of plot spread across two hours, and it's not even like the characters are enjoyable or likeable either."

For a considerable amount of time it put a black spot on two seriously talented people and was considered one of the worst movies of it's time.\n\nFinally watching it for myself though and I don't really get why. Yeah, this isn't a good movie. It's clunky and awkward, it's forced and ridiculous but it is in no way as awful as it's made out to be. This is a forgettable nonsense movie that would be perfectly at home replaying on daytime tv for the hundredth time. Honestly, I wouldn't even hate it if it happened to be on somewhere and that's really the big issue. People act like this is some vile, reprehensible film and I just don't think it's worth that level of disdain. It's just an underwhelming film. Nothing more. Nothing less."

        "review_detailed_main": "`Awful', `Hopeless', `Terrible', `Benifer's Gate'.\n\nThese are the words I read from some of North America's most respected film critics in my research before viewing the debacle Gigli starring Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez. At first, I wondered aloud 'how bad can it be'. After all, how often does the common public agree with the harsh words of a critic. Besides, Pacino and Walken in the same film should be enough to generate even one star out of even the sternest critic, right. Right?\n\nGigli is about two unbelievable gangsters who are assigned the task of kidnapping and watching over a prosecutors mentally challenged brother while also keeping an open eye on each other to ensure the success of the operation. Ben plays Gigli, an accent challenged goon who is as believable as Madonna in a nuns uniform, and Jennifer plays Ricky, a lesbian gangster who is primarily hired to ensure that Gigli doesn't screw things up.\n\nAlong the way, plenty of bit characters and ridiculous side plots stymie the progress of the mission. Ricky has an ex-lover show up at the house and attempt suicide, the gangsters ask for the thumb of the prisoner sent to the prosecutor, Gigli has to rush to his mothers house and learns that good ole ma knows all about lesbians and throughout the film we are constantly annoyed by conversations between Gigli and his crime boss, Lenny over the phone. I could go on, but what's the point.\n\nGigli was one of the worst reviewed films of 2003. So I began to wonder why this film in particular ended up on everyone's poop list even though there were plenty of worse films people were throwing good money at (Boat Trip, Bad Boys II, Masked and Anonymous). The answer became pretty obvious. Nothing was expected of these other entries, but Gigli had the star power of the two most talked about celebrities in Tinseltown. Throw in director Martin Brest who has had incredible success with Scent of a Woman, Midnight Run and Beverley Hills Cop, and sprinkle in the veteran a-list power of Christopher Walken and Al Pacino. With a recipe as rich as these ingredients suggest, one's expectations are set to a higher standard. Gigli simply does not deliver the goods. The dialogue is so laughable that you expect this film to have midnight showings a la Rocky Horror Picture Show in the next ten years, and the characters are so eccentrically hysterical that you can't help but cringe in your seat in embarrassment for all those involved.\n\nSo now back to the critics. We, owe you an apology. Most of the year, we read your reviews and chastise your opinions, but every once and a while, a consensus amongst your peers keeps us from going in mass and spending our hard earned dollars on crap like this. A $6 million dollar domestic take for Gigli is an example of the power that you possess, and for that, I will keep reading."

That ranking was undeserved, as the movie does have decent technical aspects (editing, sound) relative to Manos and Future War. Its good to see Gigli settling a little further down the list. From the outset, I could tell the dialog was just horrible. It was unfunny 90% of the time, and contained useless overlong scenes. One example was the whole 'pleasing a woman' sequence where Lopez was doing Yoga on a mat while talking with Affleck. Just horrible. Jennifer Lopez has to win the award for most painfully miscast actress. She is totally unbelievable as a Lesbian girl gangster. She failed to convince me that she had ever broken the law in the past. 'I did some really bad things' -- yeah right. I would avoid this like the plague. 1/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Smug and a self-adorned cine-sophisticate, I rented out Gigli with a friend ready to scrutinise it with the benefit of my enlightened view of film. It was going to be an hilarious two hours. I'd settled down in a very comfy armchair and had poured a glass of some Austrian glug. I couldn't wait to laugh at the stupid dialogue and that ridiculous script but the joke was on us because Gigli transcends the established limit of effective urine stealing. This is because its simply so horrible that you can forget trying to make yourself look intelligent and media literate by ripping the bladder evacuate because the scale of misguided conception baffles the mind and eventually shuts it down. It's like being hit by a sack full of bricks in the face for a full 114 minutes. There's a teasing little scene with J-Lo early on when she tells a bunch of unruly kids that there's a martial arts move that can gouge out the eyes and simultaneously destroy the visual cortex meaning that not only are you rendered blind but you'll never be able to remember anything you've seen. For the Gigli viewer this is like showing Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to a hall packed with diabetics. You're left to ponder the short term agony weighed up against the long term benefit as Martin Brest's story unfolds with the principle characters of a unlikeable, emotionally and sexually retarded thug with a soft centre (a fat Affleck), a lesbian who isn't really a lesbian because you can be converted to heterosexuality by an emotionally and sexually retarded thug and an actually retarded man who was probably supposed to be a Rainman-type character who redeems Affleck's arrogant meathead but is in fact a cringe inducing, self-harm facilitating caricature of the mentally handicapped. Look, many movies look good on paper and suffer from poor execution but what's head scratching about Gigli is that it's as dire on the page as it is on screen. Broadly it's supposed to be a romantic comedy, sort of Out of Sight meets Rainman meets Whats New Pussycat? but it's stillborn as a criminal caper, devoid of anything approaching sensitivity and has some of the worst battle of the sexes banter that ever crawled onto the screen. Brest, who directed the dire 16 hour remake of Meet John Doe, Meet Joe Black, shows that when it comes to misjudging material he's peerless. His crimes here are compounded by the fact that this is his own script. That script, incidentally is a roll call of on screen horror. Witness, if you can, the Penis Vs. Vagina scene in which Affleck argues the case for the male genitals or the tear jerking moment in which the soft hearted Affleck, having given the Mentally Handicapped Brian relationship advice, looks on like a proud father as his new friends woos an Australian bombshell during the filming of a Baywatch beach party. You'll envy the man who gets his brains blown out and eaten by goldfish or the horrendous girlfriend of J-Lo, who having realised which film she's in, slits her wrists...stupidly, the wrong way. Once its all over and you sit there open mouthed you're left to (briefly) ponder why Brest did it. Did the kidnapped brother have to be disabled? Surely there must have been a more effective way of facilitating Affleck's transition from idiot to slightly more compassionate idiot? Did J-Lo have to be a Lesbian? Sure, Affleck has to have some obstacles toward getting the girl and we all like a bit of sexual tension but gay viewers must have been flabbergasted that a man who describes men and women as \"the bull and the cow\" and does lovable things like warmly looking vacuous and endearingly been obnoxious should persuade a woman to er, \"hop over the fence\". And even if Brest was blinded by his own vanity what in the name of Beverly Hills Cop persuaded Christopher Walken and Al Pacino to cameo? None of it makes any sense. The bottle of wine I had with the film was good though but by the time I regained consciousness the bit left in the bottle was undrinkable."

Filler just put there to pad out the time? That's basically like Gigli, a movie that's not particularly good as a whole, but has some knockout individual scenes.\n\nFirst off, let's be honest...it's not as bad as we've been led to believe. Look at the message board - more and more people are admitting \"it's not that bad\". Not exactly praise, but considering SO many people voted this into the Bottom 100 (it's at #29 when I wrote this), I think it's safe to say most of those were just padded votes, mainly from people who wanted to hate this movie and hated the whole \"Bennifer\" thing. Ebert gave it mild thumbs down and said he was deluged with hate mail complaining how he didn't hate it ENOUGH. Gimme a break.\n\nOK, the plot is awful. No bones about that. In case you don't know, here it is: A mafia hit-man kidnap's a DA's retarded brother so the case won't go to trial. He's a notorious screwup, so the mob sends a 2nd hit-man, who's a lesbian and looks like a supermodel, to make sure Hit-man #1 doesn't screw up. They sit around an apartment, talking and debating. Random people show up and they have to hide the retarded kid. Every once in a while they go out for Mexican (in a convertible with the top down!!) What in the world?? And this was supposed to be a big summer movie? I suspect writer/director Martin Brest came up for the storyline in a dream and for some reason thought it was a good idea. It's not. Watching this movie is akin to having an annoying roommate who keeps changing the channel between Rain Man, Prizzi's Honor, Chasing Amy, a failed sitcom about hit men, and any play with one set and no budget.\n\nWhy do I kinda like this movie then? Same reason I dig Brest's Beverly Hills Cop - there's scenes in here that are to die for. I remember as a kid, i'd rewind scenes in Beverly Hills Cop over and over again, because I thought they were the funniest things ever. Same here. There's at least 3 or 4 awesome scenes, and about 5 good ones as well. The rest is filler.\n\nWitness: The \"rip that tears the past\". The speech in front of the mirror. The yoga scene. \"Turkey time. Gobble Gobble.\" \"The Baywatch.\" The Tabasco sauce. The morgue. The plastic knife. The \"sweet hetero-lingus\". Christopher Walken, showing more fire in 3 minutes than he has in YEARS, talking about ice cream and Marie Callendar's pies. Pacino's scene. Yes, he's YELLING again. He's playing a mobster again. So what? Now name another recent movie with that many rewind-worthy scenes. I can't either.\n\nJennifer Lopez is sexy in this movie. Anyone who says she's not is lying. Ben Affleck is not. Nor is he supposed to be. People who say he's trying to be \"sexy and dangerous\" missed the point somewhere. He's doing a riff on Andrew Dice Clay, plain and simple. He knows he's acting like a buffoon. Anyone who likes him on SNL should like him here.\n\nEveryone should see this movie at least once. You'll have a good time. Even if you're watching it to see how bad it is, you won't be disappointed. No, I wouldn't want to sit through the whole movie again. It's too long and i honestly can't remember what the hell happened at the end. But movies like this are why DVD was invented."

The subplots are thin at best. Afleck looks like he's been hit over the head with a two by four. And what do you say about the acting talent of his fat butt leading lady? Only that in her case, \"acting talent\" is an oxymoron, like \"civilized divorce\".\n\nI don't know what I find the most revolting. The fact that this bomb cost 54 million, yes, kiddies, I said MILLION, dollars to make, or that some studio geek OKAYED it?! Afleck is a good actor. He's got some range, and a flair for comedy. But he walks around like a zombie. Perhaps this is how one looks when dying of embarrassment on film. Lopez must have some sort of, ahem, skills. She does seem to torture one male after another in her personal life. But she is a marginal singer, at best, and an ABYSMAL actress.\n\nUp until now, I thought the worst movie of all time was that Sybil Shepard horror, \"At Long Last Love\". That puppy kept the top spot for a long time on my list. But this complete disaster makes it look like \"Casablanca\".\n\nI'm a Catholic, so naturally I believe in Hell.

You will want to chug anti-freeze before the first half hour has D...R...A...G...G...E...D on by. On a scale of One to Ten, I give this a 12 Barf Bag rating.

There are films so bad that they are funny in a reversed sort of way. There are films so bad one cannot watch the end of them because they are too boring. Then there are films that are so bad they become a sort of perverse endurance test, the kind of film that dares you to turn it off before the end credits roll. Unfortunately, Gigli is definitely the third kind. Aside from having the worst principal cast this side of an Ed Wood production, the story is so utterly incompetent it defies all rational explanation (more on that anon). When released upon a gobsmacked public, Gigli attracted such terrible reviews that theatres in England never gave it a second week. David Letterman began to use it as a regular punchline about films so excruciatingly bad one would have to be mad to watch them. And therein lies one of the big problems. Gigli is merely mediocre.\n\nThe worst parts first. Whomever had the idea of casting Ben Affleck to play a mob enforcer must have been drunk, stoned, or both. He is about as intimidating as Robert De Niro's infant grandrelatives, and probably about as muscular in the forearm. He is watchable when he is not trying to pretend to be the archetypal tough-guy, but when the script requires him to be intimidating, the whole thing comes apart. The second big mistake was casting Jennifer Lopez as a higher mob enforcer called in to supervise Affleck and clean up his mistakes. To say that this stretches credulity to the outer limits is like saying that casting Jennifer Lopez in a film is a bad idea. But by far the worst problem for Gigli is a script that could have been written by trained monkeys who drank paint for weeks on end for all we know. The script's attempts at humour often revolve around the correct pronunciation of Gigli's name, a joke that gets tired about one reel in. It would have been a wiser move to build jokes around the fact that it really is pronounced \"giggly\".\n\nBut by far the worst mistake of the script lies in the central premise. It all starts with Gigli getting a call asking him to kidnap the retarded brother of a judge who is hearing a case involving one of the big bosses. The people ordering Gigli to perform this kidnapping hope that they can intimidate the judge into ruling favourably for their boss. The boss in question, played in cameo by Al Pacino, apparently did not authorise this course of action, and no wonder. Kidnapping is an incredibly serious offense under federal law, and ordering it could get anyone put away for life. Granted, mob bosses like to keep all sorts of fail-safes in place so that a case can never be made that they did in fact order such a course of action, but this is beside the point. Exactly what prompted the underboss in question to order this course of action without authority from the boss himself is something nobody who understands organised crime is ever going to figure out. Hence, the whole film regards its audience as a bunch of morons.\n\nAnother big problem for the film is that it cannot make up its mind what it wants to be. The central premise duels between comedy and mobster drama. The principal actors seem to think they are on a teenie soap opera. The editor seems to think he is meant to be making a lengthy epic. The director seems to think he is directing a music video. All of these elements combine to make an incoherent, unfocused pile of nonsense that must have been as confusing for the crew as it was for the audience. What little audience there was in theatres, anyway. Word about how terrible Gigli was spread so fast that after a mere two weeks in US theatres, Gigli limped away with a gross of six million and change against a fifty-four million dollar investment. Not surprisingly, the film was available on DVD-Video faster than most films finish their theatrical engagement. Martin Brest has not directed a film since, in spite of previously being involved in some solid works such as Beverly Hills Cop. In any case, Gigli soon became a job that everyone involved would rather forget.\n\nAnd the sad thing is that unlike Battlefield Earth, Gigli is not even bad in a funny way. It just basically sits there and shows you its offensiveness, as if mocking you for not only choosing a bad film at that particular moment, but for the fact that it managed to con various suckers into contributing more than fifty million dollars to its making. In that sense, it is like an Australian or British Prime Minister that nobody wants to be led by, but they just cannot get rid of. These days, it is all too easy for people who think they are connoisseurs of bad cinema, but are not, to label the director of a bad film the new Ed Wood. The thing is, Ed Wood consistently made films that were endearing in an especially terrible way because he was so enthusiastic to make films that he never noticed how bad he was at making them. The people involved in Gigli know they have made a bad film, and they have gone to great pains either to hide that fact, or to negate its presence in their resume. It is cynical film-making at its absolute worst. Even if it is so much fun to see Jennifer Lopez kill what is left of her unremarkable career.\n\nFor that reason, I gave Gigli a one out of ten. It works best as a test of how much you and your bad film-loving friends can really endure."

However, that is very faint credit, it is still a terrible movie with few redeeming features.\n\nThe cinematography is rather shoddy and the lighting is considerably dull. Neither do anything to compliment some decent surroundings, while the music is just bizarre and badly placed. The direction starts off inept and never recovers, while the script is just cringe-worthy with some lines verging on the really cheesy side, none of the characters are likable or well written and the story is full of plot holes and unnecessary scenes.\n\nThe acting in general is terrible. Ben Affleck is rather stiff and uncomfortable, but he is nothing compared to the terror that is Jennifer Lopez. And it doesn't help that there is absolutely no chemistry whatsoever between them. And how great actors such as Christopher Walken and Al Pacino signed up for this film I shall never know. Actually, they weren't too bad, Walken's character was just poorly explored but he did what he could. Pacino fared much better, and he is the sole saving grace of an otherwise dismal picture.\n\nAll in all, it is really, really bad but not the worst movie I have seen. 1/10 Bethany Cox"

I think the whole Bennifer thing caused some kind of mass hysteria and people have ripped Gigli for reasons that don't have much to do with the movie.\n\nIt WAS tiresome, in some ways. The Rain Main guy was just a rip-off. And Affleck's gangster was not believable at all (how did a guy as sensitive as he is ever get this tough guy rep? The movie never says). JLo was surprising good. And the script about a hot lesbian gangster and a dumb male gangster wasn't bad. Well, the ending was bad. I mean, after calling the cops and telling them where the \"lost\" brother is, JLo and Ben hang around at the scene for a long, long time.\n\nPacino is excellent. Wish he was in it more. Walken was very good, but a weird character who never shows up again.\n\nIt seemed like the major problem with Gigli wasn't the acting or the script, but the way it was edited. It had the nut of a good movie, but somehow didn't pull it off. So I gave it a 5. Honestly, it wasn't Ishtar, or even Fahrenheit 9/11."

ANyways, what's up with all the negative reviews and the other horrible things that have happened because of the reaction this movie received? From beginning to end, I though GIGLI was very enjoyable, well acted, well written with great diologue, and had a good pace.\n\nBen Affleck was having a good time with his role. Some people may say he doesn't have that tough guy persona, but he showed it really well here. Weather he was being a wisecracker or getting angry, he put in a great performance. Jennifer Lopez was excellent as Ricki. This is her best role. (That might not sound right to many people out there, but I mean it, and it's saying a lot.) Her delivery of her lines was great. And of course she and Ben had very very good chemestry. It is hard to beleive that they weren't in love at the time of this film. It was kind of like watching Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz in VANILLA SKY where you could see both actors falling for each other. Such a thing was a joy to watch.\n\nThe movie had the feeling of GET SHORTY or OUT OF SIGHT with it's quirkyness. Even something of a HUDSON HAWK feel. (Another horribly blasted movie which was really a great film. Maybe these two have something in common.) Christopher Walken and Al Pacino come in to deliver their own monologues. I always love watching Chris act. He is so funny. Al was his usual self, and I never get tired of his acting.\n\nI don't know what it is that people hate about this movie. Maybe it's because too many people are offended by how much Ben and Jenn are given so much attention because of their real life relationship. I really don't know what that has to do with hating a movie. Maybe it's because people expected something big?\n\nLike what?\n\nIt's really sad that few people will be able to see into this film as being entertaining. Martin Brest hasn't directed a movie in 5 years. (MEET JOE BLACK, A very underrated film) I get the feeling that he won't be able to direct another movie for a long time. He is a very good director. The producer, Joe Roth is saying the movie's failure is his fault too, so that's a sign that Martin will be blacklisted because of this. What kind of injustice is that? Ben and Jenn will probably have to apologize about this movie too. It's a good thing they already have other movies coming out, or else their careers could be seriously hurt.\n\nATTENTION ALL OPEN MINDED PEOPLE: This isn't the best movie of the year,\n\nbut there really is a good movie in here.\n\n8 out of 10"

        "review_title": "The review that will make my entire career questionable",
        "review_detailed_main": "I would love to view writer/director Martin Brest's original version of Gigli, which was said to be a black comedy with very offbeat humor and no romantic subplot at all. I would also love to have seen how that film would've fared amongst critics rather than the one that was released to the public. During its release, I find the film's extremely poor reception and disastrous box office performance unsurprising. The gossip about the relationship between Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez was overexposed, obsessive drivel and tabloids raced to the neverending finish line of publishing nonsensical articles about the couple and bedazzled them beyond recognition. This was one of the key things that led to Ben Affleck's negative public persona and made it irreparable until he adopted a directorial career in 2007.\n\nViewing Gigli a decade later, when news of Affleck and Lopez's relationship has long past faded into obscurity, the film is nowhere near as bad as people have said. In fact, it's a farcry from the worst film I've seen this year. I'd go as far as to call it somewhat enjoyable in the regard that it's always amusing in the way the characters interact with one another and the way the actors handle the absurd material they've been handed. However, in the long run, I prefer to view Gigli as a product and discuss its impact on its actors along with how its time of release greatly affected its reception.\n\nBut this will be explored later on. The film revolves around Larry Gigli (pronounced Jee-lee), played by Ben Affleck, a second-rate mobster who is hired by his crime boss (Lenny Venito) to kidnap the mentally-challenged brother of a federal prosecutor to prevent the imprisonment of a New York mob boss. In addition, a woman by the name of \"Ricki\" (Jennifer Lopez), a dominant lesbian, is hired by Gigli's crime boss to keep an eye on him to make sure he doesn't screw this job up. It is a screenplay obligation that Gigli and Ricki eventually become attracted to one another, despite their differing sexual orientations.\n\nIt's no surprise why the film was panned, seeing as casting both Affleck and Lopez in a romantic comedy as their heavily-documented marriage was approaching seemed to be nothing more than a tabloid-sponsored film catering to the same people that inhabit the checkout lines of grocery stores with several of the magazines on the conveyor belt. However, Affleck isn't the one giving the bad performance. His pseudo-tough guy appearance is intentional, something I hope people understood when the film was released and understand now. If anybody's performance should be criticized, it's Jennifer Lopez, who gives a wooden, wholly unbelievable performance as an attractive lesbian, who still finds it amusing and fun to flirt with a heterosexual male just to revert to the \"I'm a lesbian\" line. Her role is as contrived as they come, even with ten years of age.\n\nThe most challenging role of the film easily belongs to Justin Bartha (who later made himself a name in The Hangover franchise), playing the mentally-handicapped brother. His performance ranges from senseless exploitation to somewhat heartfelt and believable. It all depends on what writer Brest feels like detailing at the specific time. Once in a great while, we'll see his charming innocence come through. At other times, we'll see him sing a rendition of Sir Mix a Lot's \"Baby Got Back\" and do a little wincing.\n\nThe other thing to note is the film's use of music, which seems largely out of place. Consider the scene where Gigli, Ricki, and the prosecutor's brother are eating lunch and bouncy pop music plays, somewhat indicating a sex scene or a scene of seduction. The music is entirely out of place and provides an odd shift in tone. Scenes like this are rather frequent in Gigli and the jarring tonal shift is hard not to notice when it's something as quietly but noticeably abrupt as misplaced-music.\n\nOn to the legacy Gigli has left. Many people involved with the making of the film felt some kind of rough, turbulent backlash on their careers once the picture was released. It took poor Affleck, as stated, years to rebound into a marketable, respectable name, and if it wasn't for stupendous directorial efforts such as Gone Baby Gone, The Town, and Argo, his name would likely still inspire sneers and eye-rolls. Jennifer Lopez never really got back on her acting feet after this film, and became somewhat of a faded pop singer who had little to offer.\n\nBut the one person that seemed to be affected the most is director Martin Brest, who made films like Meet Joe Black and Midnight Run long before this picture. Gigli is the last film he ever made and has disbanded into something of a recluse since. He has given no interviews since its release, has not participated in any film projects, and has left his whereabouts to be nothing more than a thought in a person's mind. After the studio debacle with the film's plot and creative differences, he has vanished into unknown obscurity, with no plans to direct or participate in any film again.\n\nIt would definitely seem that people were too quick to label Gigli as one of the worst films ever made. It's definitely a rocky picture, very uneven, structured very peculiarly thanks to rewrites, and features performances that range from mediocre to above average. However, it's an entertaining piece of work, if one can accept the challenge of ignoring its horribly low ratings and criticisms it has garnered over the years. This is the kind of film I'll be judged for tolerating and, if that's the case, so be it. I got a handful of films at the top of my head that may make even the most hardened-Gigli hater reconsider their opinion."

You'd probably boast that you've guffawed your way through dreck like Jaws: The Revenge and Troll 2, and emerged, picking your teeth, demanding more. Maybe you've straight-faced your way through a conversation defending the 2015 Fantastic Four remake as a reflexive postmodern treatise on the autocannibalistic agony of commercial artistry without collapsing into hysterical, derisive laughter. You might jeer that you sit through an annual solo(!!) screening of The Room, seated on a throne of plastic spoons. You probably think you're invincible. And here you are, stumbling through the movie graveyard, preparing to test your mettle against The Big One. The Grandfather of Garbage, the Sultan of Cine-Sh*t. The man. The legend. Gigli.\n\nAbandon all hope, ye who enter here.\n\n'Ha', you sneer, defiantly hitting play on Netflix. Somewhere in the distance, you hear a faint skittering, as all nearby mice, birds, and insects flee in terror. 'This isn't so bad! I've already made it through the whole first scene of Ben Affleck's fourth-wall- breaking, excruciating Joiysey posturing and Big Hair with my wits intact. Gigli- schmeely!\" Oh ho. Just you wait, friend. This is the mere foreplay before the true agony begins.\n\nNow we venture into the land of Inquisitives. \"What are they saying? I can't decipher the bogus-Jersey!\" \"What is happening? Who is that man, hunched over those sunflower seeds? Is that Justin Bartha, that lovable scamp from National Treasure and The Hangover? What's he doing? Is he...\n\n...is that...supposed to be like Rain Man? Why is he rapping? Oh. Oh no. Oh no no.\"\n\nYes. But if this jaw-droppingly offensive depiction of an intellectual disability face-to-Big Hair with Affleck's mawkish gangster isn't already enough to make your eyes start to bleed, don't worry: you've yet to meet Jenny From The Block. She arrives, crop-topped, with a chorus of funk guitar fanfare, here to engage in glorious battle with Affleck and his Hair. A battle of the sexes, you say? Nay - they battle to see who can be the most embarrassing actor. And the battle is fierce. You think you've stomached flat, tone deaf, emotionally gyroscopic overacting before? Not like this. NOT. LIKE. THIS!\n\nAs they open their mouths, words tumble out. Words arranged so impenetrably ornately, so indefatigably nonsensical, so riotously wretched, that they extend beyond the screen like creeping Poltergeist claws, and vigorously disembowel any viewer despicable enough to be within reach. Over time, the words feed off the despair of their listeners, accruing more malevolent mass, and becoming monologues. Monologues, anointing Affleck his true title of the 'Sultan of Slick,' christening Lopez Queen 'Dykeosaurus-Rexy,' and, in a feat of Tarantino-theft that would defy belief if everything else in this movie hadn't already defied belief out of the dictionary, explaining the process of 'Digital Orb Extrusion' in Tai Moi Chai. At this point, logical thought is a distant whiff of a memory, scattered like grains of sand in the ocean of Affleck's Hair Product. You'd want to let out a silent scream. But Affleck and Lopez have stolen all the words. And all you can do is babble.\n\nBut lo! A bright star emerges! Here, we are visited by a kindly extraterrestrial from the Planet Walken. Concealing his fear behind his bug-eyed Cheshire cat grin, he attempts to approximate conventional human parlance to warn you of the dangers that ensue from prolonged exposure. But your brain has already eroded too much to decipher the coded messages hidden in his talk of ice cream and pie. Desperate, he croaks out a final warning of Gigli's most devastating side effect: \"Your tongue will slap your BRAINS out trying to get TO it!\" But it is too late. The final Brain Slap has begun.\n\nYou fester in your own sick in this purgatory of Gigli's apartment, slobbering and gibbering like a lobotomized bulldog, as the strains of inappropriately saccharine romantic synth music form a dubstep remix with the word \"Baywatch,\" and jackhammer a gong in your cavernous skull. Here, the movie sinks in for the kill. You hear Bartha utter the phrase \"penis sneeze,\" but you are numb. You see every other woman in the film reduced to a boorishly flirtatious or hysterical, whimsically suicidal lesbian caricature, but you are numb. Hell, you even sit through the final hallucinogenic indignity of Al Pacino(?!), clad in a Talking Heads oversized suit, actually trying (??!?!) to infuse some class or energy into the film.\n\nBut you are numb. Numb, because you have sat through two of the most stupefying monologues in cinema history. Behold: Ben Affleck's fist-pumping ode to the penis, and Jennifer Lopez's yogic aria to the vagina. With their powers combined, the film finally filibusters any remaining brain cells out of your head. 'He turns her straight, 1964 James Bond style?!' you would normally incredulously gripe. Normally. But by the time you reach the sanctuary of Baywatch, it's too late. Your motor functions have run their course; you are more vegetable than human now. The Brain Slap is complete.\n\nIf only you'd listened to Walken, emissary from a faraway galaxy. He would have warned you about Gigli - namely, that the effects of consumption approximate, in the words of the beloved Douglas Adams, \"having your brains smashed in by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick.\" But there is no gold here. Only pain. Only suffering.\n\nNow - if you had a chance of preventing this fate, dear viewer. If you could turn back time, and avoid drinking in this unfathomable chasm of universal offensiveness, this abominable void of oblivion. If you could save not only yourself, but the world as you know it. If you could take the hype not as a comedic, drunken challenge, but as a dire, chilling warning. Would you be, in the words of Walken, \"InTERested?\"\n\n-1/10"

It is made up of multiple sequences of no score with heavy dialogue that tries to be like Tarantino. But the dialogue never works and Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez are so bad at delivering it as if they're bored, that it comes off really weird in a way like \"The Room\", only the movie is so competently made with a big budget that it doesn't have a charm to it.\n\nIt's a gangster film AND a romantic comedy?? The plot is ridiculous, everyone is miscast from start to finish, and it's over directed to the point of looking like nobody directed it, but the biggest culprit is the script. Characters come and go with no rhyme or reason and no motivation whatsoever, the dialogue is basically a series of bad monologues strung together. Nothing that happens is interesting, and nobody seems to know it.\n\nIt's the equivalent of being on a blind date with someone that is telling a 30 minute story over dinner. You're not invested in the date, you don't care about this person's story, you don't understand how the story could possibly be this long, you kind of want to leave, and because it's all so weird you're not mad, just bemused by the whole thing."

A lot of things, such as the lighting and perhaps the editing, seem slightly amateurish, and if they tried making a standard Hollywood blockbuster, they failed miserably. However, those who have seen and appreciated independent movies before will probably not be too appalled by this.\n\nThe script is quite strange, but mainly this is actually a good thing. I thought the non-standard humorous parts were funny and rather intelligent, particularly a scene with an extremely odd police officer, played by Christopher Walken. The quirky script makes the story progress very slowly, however, with the risk of boredom - but the unpredictable nature of the film added a bit to the suspense. Perhaps also aided by the decent soundtrack, I was able to connect with the characters. I thought the movie was fair enough.\n\nBen Affleck's character is an awkward and pathetic type, and I guess this gives a risk that such a flawed movie itself will have an overall awkward feel. It does, but not to a gigantic and ridiculous degree. The acting is never superb, but really not astonishingly bad either. Worse things happen at sea. The chemistry between Affleck and Lopez is very poor, but that sort of adds to the story. If you're looking for a turkey, this movie will probably disappoint you. I've seen far, far, far worse."

How it's the worst film ever made, how it represents every thing wrong with cinema, how it can bring about the apocalypse etc. Everyone hates this film, even its stars Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez. But is it really that bad. Well I can tell you quite simply that the answer is- Yes, yes it is. OK so it's not the worst film ever made its more like the 786th worst ever made, which considering how many movies there are that is saying quite a lot. The film is labeled as a romantic gangster comedy (3 genres that go together like bread and butter and bleach). Well let's see how it fails at being all 3 genres.\n\nRomance- Ben and Jennifer, despite going out at the time, have zero chemistry. Unless you find watching a loud mouthed homophobe and a stereotypical lesbian hooking up romantic.\n\nGangster- the gangster stuff is completely watered down and the whole gangster plot is polluted with plot holes.\n\nComedy- if you find jokes at the expense of the mentally disabled and lesbians funny than your kind of comedy. However if not than this film will leave dead silence between every supposedly \"hilarious\" gag."

Affleck is a native of my home state but in this film he obviously watched every Sopranos DVD and tried without success to be James Gandolfini. Scenes with the mentally challenged kid are tedious and uncomfortable but the reading of the Tabasco sauce bottle was pretty clever. Some of the movies critics love like As Good As It Gets are much worse than this. Again I reiterate a solid 5."

        "review_detailed_main": "Fact: A film where an overexposed celebrity couple that star together as a double act will always become a vanity project. Fact: Vanity projects in modern cinema simply do not work. Fact: Vanity projects bomb at the box office. Fact: Most of them include pop stars. And fact: Pretty much all of them absolutely suck.\n\nSo imagine how I must have felt when I heard that Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck, were chosen to play in a role in a film that tries to rip off The Godfather. At first I though it was just a sick joke. However I was wrong and soon enough, Gigli was released.\n\nNow the critics gave Gigli an absolute slaughtering, the kind of panning that generates a kind of curiosity. \"Is it REALLY that bad?\". And of course with Gigli it's all justified. Gigli is the kind of embarrassment that people ought to should be hung upside down for. It's a truly appalling film.\n\nSo why am I the latest person to give this film an absolute bashing? Because I've seen it, and from my personal view it deserves it. In other words, I watched this piece of crap so that you don't have to. And here's a low down of what I ended up watching for my \u00a35.\n\nFirstly, The Direction. Martin Brest (The same man behind Beverly Hills Cop and Midnght Run) is behind this movie, so talk about a guy with no excuse! It's difficult to understand what he was smoking when he gave the go ahead for this disaster, which goes wrong in so many ways that you can barely keep count of them. He's allowed the film to be completely shapeless. From The Plot, The Cast right down to the small and unimaginative scenes, it can only be described as an awful messy blot on his copybook.\n\nSecondly you have the cast themselves. Now we already know that Jennifer Lopez has modelled herself on Madonna's woeful pictures from day one, but Affleck (normally competent)is in way over his head. And worse still, veterans like Al Pacino and Christopher Walken turn in some very poor cameos. It's painful to think the lead in Scarface is being now bogged down in this commercial vanity fair guff.\n\nThen the story. Affleck, plays Larry Gigli, a dim bulb of a mob enforcer. Gigli has kidnapped mental patient Brian (Justin Bartha, doing Rain Man), the kid brother of a federal prosecutor, to keep mob boss Starkman (Al Pacino) from going to jail. Don't ask how. Know only that mob girl Ricki (Lopez), a lesbian with a suicidal girlfriend, has been sent in to make sure Gigli doesn't screw up. Lopez treats the role like a photo shoot, doing yoga exercises in Gigli's apartment and ruminating on why it's more erotic to kiss a vagina than a penis. I wish, I truly wish I was making this up.\n\nBut then comes the dialogue. Welcome to hell. The dialogue enters \"Manos The Hands Of Fate\" territory in terms of sheer awfulness. Here's what I like to call the Three Crown Jewells in terms of this movies atrocious script.\n\n1) \"Turkey Time! Gobble Gobble\" During a bedroom scene! WHAT THE HELL?!\n\n2) \"Mooooo\" A cow noise that Larry uses to seduce his partner? We are still on planet earth aren't we?\n\n3) \"It's more erotic to kiss a vagina than a penis.\" STOP IT STOP IT STOP IT!\n\nGigli will stand for years to come as an example of how not to produce a love story movie. Gigli isn't even in the Freddy Got Fingred realm where it's so bad it's good. It's in the painful excruciatingly bad, almost like puncture wounds being inflicted in the cinema area.\n\nManos The Hands Of Fate, may still be the worst movie of all time but it has got some powerful competition from Gigli. Oh and by the way, Gigli, rhymes with really. As in Gigli, Gigli bad. And one more thing, there's more than a dozen worse movies worse than this? Do us a favour!\n\nDon't Watch This Film."

Also cute to see Joey Lauren Adams given a small role in the middle of the movie as \"Crazy suicidal ex-girlfriend\".\n\nBut basically not a success. Throwing in a whole lot of additional parallel plot about criminals and the mentally handicapped alongside the basic Chasing Amy \"can I get this lesbian to fall in love with a Jersey Shore stereotype\" rom-com plot was surely a bad idea. Hybrid movies can work; something like The Whole Nine Yards is a fine mashup of romance, comedy, and crime. But the more elements you add, the more precise you need to be; and the fine details that make such a hybrid work are lacking here.\n\nIt's not as bad as the 2.6 rating would have you believe. But it's not great. I can't put my finger on quite what's wrong with it, but there's just no magic; all very competent, all very carefully weighed so as not to offend anyone regardless of gender, sexual orientation, mental ability, or criminality stance. But just doesn't sparkle."

        "review_detailed_main": "I went into Gigli with very low expectations. I had heard it is considered one of the worst movies ever made and boy, they were not kidding. This movie is not only bad but also extremely offensive. I don't know how anybody thought making this was a good idea. Everyone involved should be ashamed for releasing it.\n\nLet's start off with the movie's plot. A gangster named Larry played by Ben Affleck is hired to kidnap a disabled boy to please his boss or something. He then meets a woman sent by his boss named Ricki played by Jennifer Lopez, his real life wife who is a lesbian at the start and somehow falls in love with him. The boss asks him to cut off the boy's thumb and Larry refuses to do so. To please his boss, he sneaks into a morgue and cuts off the thumb of a dead body and mails it to him. They discover the thumb doesn't belong to him and a guy is shot dead. Larry and Ricki get into a fight over something and the movie ends with the boy being taken to a Baywatch. Yes, the story is stupid and confusing but that's not the worst part. The acting is horrendous as well. None of the main stars give a believable performance, and the portrayal of a disabled person by Justin Bartha was not only not convincing but downright offensive. As a person with autism, this genuinely disgusted me. Gigli certainly does not work as a gangster movie, and it doesn't work as a comedy either. No joke is funny and even the dialogue is terrible. There are sexual conversations in this movie that go into graphic detail and it is vomit inducing. There's even a scene with a woman cutting her wrists and the movie tries to make it funny. The movie also has Italian stereotypes, believe it or not, and it features a scene with Christopher Walken and another with Al Pachino. I don't know why they agreed to be part of this but they might just be the only good things in this movie.\n\nAnyways, Gigli is a movie that really does live up to its reputation as one of the worst of all time. I really think it deserves a 1/10 (a rating I give to very few movies) because it is stupid, offensive, and tonally inconsistent."

It just doesn't add up, as no one who is supposed to be that smart can also be equally that dumb.\n\nThis is like a really badly made low budget B movie made for way too much money & hiring big stars like Walken & Pacino to appear in it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Not the worst movie of all time, contrary to popular opinion, but certainly not a good movie either. It suffers from a lot of things, starting with wanting to be a drama but at the same time a romantic comedy, and failing at both. Mainly it seems to be a vehicle for Jennifer Lopez, three years after she wrote that green Versace dress at the Grammy's and still on top of the world, and who at the time had left Cris Judd for Ben Affleck to form Bennifer 1.0. She's gorgeous but you would probably be happier watching scenes like the one where she's doing yoga with the sound muted, the dialogue is so atrocious.\n\nOne of the biggest issues with the film is with her lead man, Ben Affleck, whose character is an unlikeable tool, made worse by the way he performs it. Seriously, if the thought of wanting to punch him in the face doesn't cross your mind, you're a saint. The problem is not thar he makes Lopez's character \"go straight\" as mentioned in many reviews because that's not even what happens (and she's pointed out she's been with men before) - the problem is he's so utterly charmless that there's absolutely no way her character would want to share a bed with him, let alone sleep with him. Affleck is caught in no-man's land here - a character too soft to be a gangster, one of the plot points, but still abrasive and arrogant in his personal relationships. It's dissatisfying both ways, and tonally the film is wildly inconsistent.\n\nAl Pacino makes an appearance and gets his big moment in, but it doesn't fit the film at all. The other cameo, Christopher Walken, just seems awkward, with Walken trying to make something good out of the crappy lines he was given and failing. Then there's the kidnap victim, a mentally challenged man, played by Justin Bartha, who you may know as the sidekick Riley in National Treasure. Suffice it to say that unsurprisingly, this character is handled poorly and it's cringe-worthy how he's played for laughs, even if the film thinks it's showing empathy in that final Baywatch scene, which was ridiculous.\n\nWatchable especially if you have low expectations, but be prepared to howl at the screen, and to endure 122(!) minutes."

The first point to highlight in this movie is a question: Why Al Pacino, Christopher Walker, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck accept such a cheesy and corny screenplay? The characters of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez are so ridiculous that spoil any story. Ben Affleck begins the movie as a tough guy, followed by a spoiled son, a romantic guy and ending like a good man. The delicious Jennifer Lopez begins lesbian (amazing, a director who gives the role of lesbian to one of the most sexy, delicious and beautiful women of the planet) and ends the story in love with Larry.

What I did see was an authentic and extensive sprinkling of coarse language and the evolving relationship between a coarse man and a human with mental disabilities as well with a sophisticated refined woman who had a lot to teach both Gigli and the audience about language, about peaceful resolution to conflict, about courage, and strong femininity. This movie really stood out for its carefully crafted treatment of mental disability in the same vein as Rain Man (1988) and its handling of violence. This movie instead of the typical rough housing, masculine action movie, this movie turns the stereotypical crime thriller into a relational drama that offers up valuable lessons for living. This movie is a substantive and worthwhile look at the awkward and amusing tension between masculinity and femininity."

Two of these movies are down right awful. Much worse than Gigli, which has some redeeming qualities, these movies didn't seem to find their way to the IMDB's bottom 100 of all time. Aside from the glaring contrast between these movies from the same time frame, we aren't here to talk about them.\n\nGigli does feature Affleck at his worst (and I know he can and has done a lot better); however, Jennifer Lopez was surprisingly good in this movie. She exhibited a great deal more range and showed that maybe she's just getting a bad rap from naysayers like the ilk over at Aint It Cool.

Bennifer do have some on-screen chemistry, and there are a few cute moments. The infamous \"gobble gobble\" scene is fun if you disregard the probability of a lesbian acting in such a way (see also CHASING AMY), and I also enjoyed penis/vagina debate. And Rain Boy's moment on the beach was sweet, unlikely as it may be.\n\nBut the movie just drones on and on, the music is incongruous with what it's supporting on screen, the plot is uninvolving, and and the outta-nowhere cameos by Al Pacino, Lainie Kazan, and Christopher Walken stop the movie cold. But Ben takes his shirt off, revealing a buff bod and some nice tats. See? The movie's not entirely without merit.\n\nNow and then the media pounce on a movie that begs to be trashed but isn't nearly as bad as they say. (The SWEPT AWAY remake was a previous whipping boy, and while indeed a bad movie, it was better than other Madonna movies like THE NEXT BEST THING and BODY OF EVIDENCE.) GIGLI is not a good movie, but not an insufferable one like, for example, GLITTER.

It has the reputation of being one of the worst films of all time, and that reputation is well-deserved. Usually, I can sit through a movie at least once even if I hate it. This is one movie that I could not sit through.\n\nAn afternoon in the dentist's chair is more appealing to me than watching this film, and I am not kidding.\n\nThe issues with this film are numerous, and have been well-documented. One, is the complete lack of chemistry between the two leads. Considering that they were a mega-couple at the time and inspired one of the most famous couple names of all time, you'd think J-LO and Affleck would actually have chemistry on-screen. Well, you would think so, but you would be very, very wrong. It's been years since Bennifer was a thing, but the two have zero chemistry as a couple on-screen and you have to wonder where their supposed passionate love affair was reflected, because there's no sign of it here.\n\nThe title is another issue. For years, I thought the name of this was \"Giggly.\" Well, color me surprised when I found out it was not! Live and learn.\n\nI'm not sure why exactly two Oscar winning actors like Pacino and Walken are in this film. Did they lose a bet? Did they need money at the time? Did they not read the script before agreeing to be in this? I found myself pondering these questions so much that I could not even focus on the film itself- although judging by what other people have said, I didn't really miss too much.\n\nI cannot help but feel sorry for director Martin Brest here. The guy went from directing quality films to directing this mess, and has not directed anything since. He also wrote the film, but creative control was taken away from him here so it was not the film he'd originally envisioned. So I give him a pass there.\n\nSo, my final advice when it comes to \"Gigli\": eat glass instead of watching this. It will be less painful."

The film had some lighter moments of Humor and some subtle references that the world is not what it always seems to be. Don't believe what most are saying... This film is not that bad. Give it a chance and if you don't at least crack a smile or Two... You are a humorless individual who needs to be put away on an Island for the humor impaired, and think deep like the dialogue suggests then you will find Gigli to be Enjoyable.\n\nThe Performances by Pacino and Walken are at least worth the $4.000 rental charge at Blockbuster alone.\n\n7/10"

Anyway, Larry \"Rhymes with Really\" Gigli (Ben Affleck) is a wannabe mobster who is assigned to kidnap Brian (Justin Bartha), the federal prosecutor's mentally handicapped brother. Because Larry is such a wet sandwich gangster, he gets a surprise visit from Ricki (Jennifer Lopez) whom he resents at first, but, of course, they end up in the sack together. Things get ugly when Starkman (Al Pacino) arrives, kills Louis (Lenny Venito), and tells Larry what an embarrassment he is, but Larry and Ricki quit and take Brian to \"the Baywatch\". Gigli is one of the most oddly-concocted films I have seen, with an ill-conceived story, bizarre subplots, and performances so off-collar that the actors look confused at what's going on. Ben Affleck seems more focused on acting like an egocentric douchebag than a lesser mob man and J-Lo, despite playing a badass bodyguard, comes off as just a special needs caretaker with a hot bod. Pacino is even worse, overacting in every sentence and emphasizing every four-letter word. However, Gigli's saving grace is Justin Bartha as Brian, who is desperate to lose his virginity yet has to take abuse from Larry in almost every scene. A very special shout-out goes to Christopher Walken and his awkwardly hilarious switch from a serious interrogation to a 20-second monologue about pie. Gigli is such an odd egg to sit through and is one of the classic examples of a bad romantic comedy. (1 Marie Calendar Pie a la Mode out of 5) (It's turkey time... Gobble gobble.)"

If people expect a high-quality-script they should go rent \"Schindler's List\", but to slam a movie that's meant to entertain, is just uncalled for. I realize that many do not like Jennifer and Ben being a couple and being promoted a lot by the media. But it should be about the movie itself, and not about what the main characters are doing in real life with one another.\n\nI really do not understand the whole propaganda against the movie. I'd advise everyone to just have a look for themselves staying open-minded still after having read a lot of awful reviews of people that just go with what the majority says and that only dislike the main actors."

Something to do with kidnapping a mentally challenged brother of a federal prosecutor. But who the actual frick cares about that insensitive onslaught of \"comedic ingenuity\". Brest didn't! His focus was having a straight man forcibly manipulate a gay woman into questioning her sexuality because romance. A-frickin-hilarious! With Affleck overacting every line of dialogue whilst shouting \"MAAA!\" every minute and Lopez still thinking she's \"Jenny from the Block\", there was no chemistry. I mean, there is an actual scene where she is performing yoga, talking about phallic sea slugs and her \"pussy\"? (Urgh, hate that word...). I can't.\n\nIt was so bizarre. I just wanted the \"it's turkey time. Gobble gobble\". And I had to sit through two hours of nothingness and self-loathing to get there! Christopher Walken waltzed in for two minutes, adding nothing to the story! Al Pacino for frick's sake shouting his ass off like he's Tony frickin' Montana, shooting a guy in the head (in a romcom!!)! Why is there a Dido lookalike slashing her wrists? This isn't \"White Flag\"! Why the hell am I questioning this? With no romantic chemistry, no laughs and no plot, Jeegillgiligliy is essentially an insensitive mess that would rather focus on bulls, cows and pronouncing the frickin' title surname \"correctly\".

        "review_detailed_main": "In France, we had the luck to get \"Gigli\" a few months after America. Lopez and Affleck have never got the kind of media exposure they seem to have in the US. Actually, they receive a lot of exposure but not to the point they're making headlines every day.\n\nSo \"Gigli\" got a limited release, which will qualify it to a DVD release. There were a few posters in the streets of Paris, almost the only place where it was screened. After a week, bye bye \"Gigli\". I went to see this movie because of my own guilty pleasure in very bad movies, a hilarious feature in \"The Onion\" (about sneak previews reactions) and the idea of hearing J-Lo saying \"penis\".\n\nI admit that \"Gigli\" is indeed bad. It might not be the worst movie of this year (for instance, it has some kind of coherence, a plot and actors trying to act, compared to \"The Matrix Reloaded\") but it's bad. There are a few good things in it. There are some scenes of true comedy, especially when Affleck looks at himself in the mirror, admiring his own muscles. It's clear that this scene, the meeting with Gigli's mother or some lines are truly funny and work more or less. Some of the bad press this movie received was due to his main couple media overkill. Some people were bored to death with the two leading actors. But Jennifer Lopez had even more ill-matched roles. She was a psychiatrist dressed as Virgin Mary, she was a maid cleaning up the bathrooms, she was an abused spouse. And these movies were hits anyway. Affleck, as a lead actor, has never got much charisma or good charm. He was the star of a few movies (Daredevil, Pearl Harbor, The Sum of all Fears) because there's no other actor in his generation that would fit the good guy character. But he's still bland. \"Gigli\" was one movie too much for either of them... So for the two of them...\n\nBut the main thing is that the movie is flawed from the beginning. It could not have been a good movie but with a few changes it would have certainly been a bearable movie.\n\n1) The cast. The use of \"glamorous\" actors is utter stupidity. If there was any play with their public image, it could have been better but it's hard to picture two celebrities as mediocre people, no-names without any redeeming quality. Why is good-looking Gigli a truant rather than a model or an actor? And the dream of the kidnapped brother is to go to \"Baywatch\". Well, dude, you've got JENNIFER LOPEZ in front of you and you only think of Pamela Anderson? No wonder they put you in an hospital.\n\n2) The acting. Jennifer Lopez, with her high-toned voice isn't convincing for a second. She just chews her lines and has from time to time a tongue-in-cheek smile to show the audience she's the smarter one. Ben Affleck is marginally better. He could be almost convincing as a dumb loser. But the biggest disappointment lies with the cameos of both Walken and Pacino. I've never seen them overacting so much. They make Robert DeNiro in \"We're No Angels\" or \"The Untouchables\" look like a model of understatement. I guess they must have received some good money because they show all their acting tricks during their scene. Pacino is particularly hammy and Christopher Walken doesn't bring anything to the movie.\n\n3) The story line. Poor, poor, poor. Brest desperately tries to be original and he ends up with a gross and meaningless study of men-women relationships. In many movies you can have some plot holes. The audience will be indulgent or the holes will bring an eerie climate. In \"Gigli\", you can't help noticing these plot holes. Why is Gigli's boss stupid enough to ask Gigli to take care of this dangerous mission? What happens to the lesbian lover? It has simply no coherence.\n\n4) The tone. Twenty minutes could have been cut and nobody would complain.\n\nI guess the director tried to make a loose and free-minded satirical comedy about relationships between men and women. His script could have given at best a mediocre independent movie. It could only get worse when it was turned into a blockbuster. Instead of subtlety, you only perceive vulgarity. It was a no-win situation.\n\nThe only really sad thing about \"Gigli\" is not that it makes you waste two hours. It is that studios will be even more reluctant to give the green light to anything a little original."

Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez are simply not believable as 'tough' gangsters. And Jennifer Lopez seriously is the most unbelievable movie lesbian in history. And I don't mean unbelievable like in a compliment. I'm not one of those 'Bennifer' haters but as a fair neutral viewer of this movie I have to simply admit that they were awful, as was the movie in general. Cameo's from Christopher Walken and Al Pacino were the highlights of the movie. Seriously, Al Pacino's role is what make's this movie still a bit watchable. Also Lenny Venito was somewhat enjoyable in his villain role.\n\nThe pace is also totally wrong. Most of the scene's are taking too long and are dragging on. The movie should at least had been halve an hour shorter. Also maybe if the movie had completely been made in comedy style it would had perhaps been a better or more enjoyable movie to watch.\n\nWhat was director/writer Martin Brest thinking?

I have to admit that I laughed at some of the jokes and moments so I was not totally bored while watching.\n\nNot a complete train-wreck but also not exactly recommendable either.\n\n3/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

So, if it isn't so bad, why did almost 70% of people give it a one? Rating this movie wasn't about evaluating Gigli. It was all about making a statement. Many people were sick of hearing and reading about Ben & Jen on the news, on tabloid covers, in the newspapers, etc. Those that were tired of the couple saw to it that the movie would fail. Those that wanted it to fail should be very happy because their wish came true. To call Gigli a bomb is an understatement.\n\nIs it the worst movie in the world? I don't think so. This movie has some big name actors that did their best to try and make it work. The plot was OK too. So what went wrong?\n\nThe real downfall of the movie was the dialog. This can be overcome when movies are exceptional in other areas. Titanic and the Matrix sequels had terrible dialog and a weak story, but they were both commercial success because they had good special effects. Gigli's problem is that it isn't exceptional in other areas, so there is nothing in the film to offset the terrible dialog.\n\nBad dialog is a real problem in movies. Every good movie has to suspend your disbelief so you forget you are watching a movie and you get engrossed. If the dialog is bad, then they need to get you into the movie with special effects, plot, groundbreaking cinematography, etc."

        "review_detailed_main": "Public backlash to this film was immediate, intense and in my thinking, irrational. The public was so sick of hearing about the Affleck/Lopez relationship by release time(justifiably so) that as soon as the bad reviews started to pour in from critical sources, most people were quick to call in the worst film ever before even seeing it.\n\nThe rub here is that \"Gigli\" isn't the worst film ever -- it's merely really bad. A really bad movie isn't inept enough to be unintentionally hilarious for the ironic viewer. It takes a truly horrible movie to become a great comedy, while Gigli is just bad enough to be boring without becoming funny. As a result I was disappointed, as I'm sure many others who expecting this to be an unintentional comedy masterpiece were.\n\nMost disappointing - and unfair, in my opinion - were the performances of Affleck and Lopez, which were wooden and dull but certainly not the complete train wreck I was led to expect. Also, to blame them for making this awful movie is just asinine on the part of the viewing public. The pair of leads are *not* the reason \"Gigli\" sucks. It sucks for the reasons every other bad movie sucks: bad writing and awful direction. The screenplay is a forced, hackneyed attempt at emulating the hip crime films of the '90s(of the \"Pulp Fiction\" variety). The direction and editing is even worse; just about every scene is unmemorable, drab, uninspired, and proceeds at an excruciatingly slow pace. Martin Brest is both director and screenwriter, and he is the one who should have been lambasted endlessly by critics. No love for Affleck/Lopez from me, but let's at least give credit where it is due."

It has some scenes, that are nice, not spectacular, but overall decent, but then it has scenes in it, which feel that they are in a wrong film.\n\nNow, Gigli (Ben Affleck) has to look after a retarded young man Brian (Justin Bartha), who is a brother of a D.A. Now, Gigli is looking after the kid, because he's been kidnapped in order to extort the D.A. Because Gigli's boss doesn't trust him, he sends another babysitter, Ricki (Jennifer Lopez), who is a lesbian. I said it because, well here's the catch, Ben and Jennifer were dating back when this movie was made and someone felt it was a great idea, if this movie, which started as a sort of a crime comedy would be turned into a romcom, because, hey, Bennifer was the hottest thing of the week in the land of dreams. And thus we see, how Gigli beds the lesbian.\n\nThe film doesn't seize to amaze me, as it has pretty good supporting cast. There's Pacino and Walken there, but only thing they do is their classic \"look, I raise my voice and am menacing\" bits and then they're out. And we get back to the romcom. Even a suicide attempt of Rickis crazy ex-girl is left as \"whoops, look what just happened\" moment.\n\nAs I said, this movie has some bits, that are good. While you watch it you can see another path, which would lead into a bit better film than this is, but the path is left alone and we are shown a story, that is more predictable and boring than anything else."

There's no action or violence in this movie to back it up, she never takes anyone out or anything. Its just an entire movie of men acting like she is so much more badass than they are. Other than that there's no real story here, no real content, no style, no substance. Just an epic failure of a feminist statement. There's nothing here to like, nothing worth watching.

Never in the history of motion pictures has a film been dead in the water before it ever made it to the big screen. Critiques were waiting to trash this film. Had it turned out to be the second coming of \"Gone With the Wind,\" they still would have trashed it. Fans, feeding off the negativity, trounced it as well. It never had a chance. Now that some time has passed and it can be looked at without the animosity and preconceived hatred of Ben and Jen, I think Gigli stands up pretty well. Let me say, at the time, I was not particularly a fan of Ben Affleck, nor was I then or currently a fan of J-Lo's singing or acting. I just thought the movie had a nice story, some funny dialog, and actually deserved better than it got from fans. For those who do not know, Affleck is Gigli, a wannabe mob stooge who is given the task of kidnapping Brian, the retarded brother of a government witness. Enter, Ricki, a lesbian assassin who is hired to ride herd on Gigli so he does not screw up. Gigli starts to fall for Ricki and she, despite her orientation, feels something special for him as well. The byplay between Affleck and Lopez is funny and its obvious they have chemistry (even if they eventually broke up). J-Lo's yoga routine alone is reason to own this movie. If there is a better explanation (and visual) of the difference between the male and female genitalia than the one J-Lo espouses while stretching in spandex, I have not seen or heard it. Justin Bartha (later to gain fame as Riley in the \"National Treasure\" movies) gives a pretty impressive performance as the mentally-challenged Brian. My biggest issue with this movie is the inclusion of Al Pacino as a gangster (talk about stretching yourself as an actor) At some point in his career, someone told Pacino that acting entails slowly raising his voice until he is railing at the top of his lungs. That's all he does in his movies. He just escalates his tone. That's not acting. That's a recipe for an ulcer. This movie is not going to change your life, but its also not going to end it. See it without the baggage of petty critics and People Magazine-influenced movie goers."

BUT, but, but, but, that is a huge BUT, I can see why people don't like this film, and why I found it to be a bad idea as well as a bad film, the cast was beyond a mistake. First off, this movie was made during the time of the media craze of Bennifer, so it made it kind of annoying to see these two together again, but it's mostly Ben and Jennifer's acting \"abilities\" that kill the film. I'm supposed to believe that Jennifer is a \"tough\" gangster who does nothing to prove she is dangerous and that she is a lesbian? Not likely. Ben is also supposed to be a tough like New York accent dumb gangster? His accent was in and out during the whole movie. Also, did Christopher Walken and Al Pacino like owe Ben and Jennifer a favor? Because they so did not belong in this movie.\n\nBasically we have a screw up gangsta hit man who for some reason keeps getting hired instead of killed, Gigli(his name rhymes with really), he has to kidnap a retarded brother of a politician. But Gigli's boss thinks he needs to be watched by a hot lesbian gangsta, Ricki, who just refuses to sleep with Gigli, understandably, but he's a brat about it. Then his mom hits on her, very scary, and she ends up liking him anyways. But they end up liking the retarded kid and want to help him because they are now the tough hit men with a heart of gold? Now somehow this was turned into a ridiculous romantic comedy.\n\nNow Gigli like I said is not the worst movie I've seen, but it is a bad one. The only reason why I saw it was because I was so curious if it really was the worst movie of all time, is it? No, I wouldn't say so, but it is up there. The script was not at all well done, and very hard to believe. But for the most part it was Ben and Jennifer, I'm not saying that to hate on them, it's just a true fact. They were just the worst cast for a mafia type of movie, what was the casting agent thinking? I'm glad the Bennifer thing is over, but it's sad that Ben and Jennifer will always have to look at this moment in their lives and be teased about it, because if I have a bad weekend, I'm going to say it was \"Gigli\" bad from now on.\n\n1/10"

Certainly, the obnoxious Quotient of Bennifer and J-Fleck did'nt help but, I truly prayed for this to work out for the best, if just for the sake of Martin Brest (Christ man He made Midnight Run!!). As for Pacino and Walken, well Pacino lost it a long time ago, (the HooHa!! thing from Scent of a Woman went to his head, so all he does is mug and yell now) But Walken must have Just needed spending Cash. Although it still ain't worse than Swept Away, Gigli is pretty damn bad!!!"

Gigli was released in 2003 during the peak of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez's romance career, and many have dismissed the film's failures on them. The film had a massive budget of 54 million yet only made 7 million worldwide. One would consider this as a major reason for the film being as criticized.\n\nGigli has a different sense of what is wants to be. Considered as a romantic crime comedy. The film does bring out several levels of romance in a predictable relationship with the leads. The plot is thin and the film does have several scenes which stretch out, yet could have been edited about 20 minutes shorter. Although even with its flaws, Gigli remains an entertaining watch, due to the fact that there are many unintentional funny and clever scenes. For such a crime gangster film, the ending does have a heart and tender feel about it. Many have dismissed the film as too violent, though there is only one really violent scene, as an unexpected jump scene. Lenghty cameo scenes are made by Christopher Walken and Al Pacino, in which some considered a saving point of the film. As a rewatch on 05/10/23' Gigli remains an unintentional funny film which is still better than criticized for. The pace is off at certain points yet still enjoyable."

He didn't seem genuine and it looked like he was trying to rush out of the movie instead of letting the movie just flow.

My father and I were watching television early on a Saturday morning, and some sort of all-purpose newscast brought up \"Gigli,\" which had apparently imploded following one night of screening. When the film finally turned up on videocassette at a thrift store for fifty cents five years later, I decided I would take the plunge.\n\nI had a hard time telling what was funny because it was funny, and what was supposed to be dramatic and turned out funny because it was bad, and what was supposed to be funny but turned out bad because it was bad. The plot - following two \"contractors\" and the mentally retarded man they kidnap - takes place primarily indoors, with a healthy mix of driving scenes that seem to inexplicably seem to loop back to the same house each time. Christopher Walken and Al Pachino both appear for one scene each, then vanish - giving the film an Alice-in-Wonderland feel, as if the whole thing was written by somebody running a fever of 102.\n\nMaybe it was.\n\nWhat I will say for \"Gigli\" was that it is watchable. It's not something I'd pay more than fifty cents to see, but was watchable. This sets it apart from a lot of the other bad movies I've seen - or, for that matter, some of the allegedly good ones. The worst movie I ever saw was called \"Breaking the Waves.\" Yes, I know the rest of you liked it, but I didn't. Sometimes quality and watchability are at odds - and here, a bad movie was watchable. Despite the incredibly bad... everything, I never actually felt compelled to turn the TV off.\n\nIn my opinion, this was a bad movie. A really, REALLY bad movie. But it never really crossed the line from \"awful\" to \"unbearable.\" So yeah, watch it if you get the chance. But don't tell anybody you did."

And from all that we got one of the worst movies of 2003.\n\nI've said many times that I don't feel Ben is a good actor and he did nothing in this movie to change my mind. Whereas Jennifer has been able to hold her own in some movies. But the two of them together in this? Sorry. It just didn't work. There was no real chemistry between them although part of that might have to do with the plot.\n\nHe plays a young man in the mob who one day is charged with kidnapping and holding the nephew of a judge or governor or some important person as leverage in a court case. Jennifer is then sent to keep an eye on Ben because he's a bit of a screw up. She's also a lesbian so she's got no interest in him. But as time goes by she falls for his charms and they wind up together.\n\nIf there's one good thing I can say about this movie it's the presence of Christopher Walken. He plays a higher up in the mob and while the movie is crap, his scenes are always a breath of fresh air. He's so bizarre and entertaining in his scenes that he at least makes those scenes interesting. Seriously they're the only good parts of this trainwreck."

And why was anyone persuaded that the script, by Brest, was worth making in the first place?

Thankfully, everyone's forgotten about this movie, or if they do remember it, they roll their eyes and groan.\n\nLet's start with the obvious: Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez aren't a headline-snatching couple anymore. Why do we want to watch a movie that was probably only made to capitalize on when they were? Next up, JLo plays a lesbian, but she continually flirts and banters with Ben, so it's pretty obvious they'll wind up in bed together. How is that old stereotype, that all a lesbian needs is the right man, something enjoyable to watch? Third, which is a criticism in the same vein, in order to simultaneously entice him and push him away with her disinterest and independence, JLo gives a monologue about how every man and woman is actually a lesbian-while practicing her yoga. Then, after the inevitable happens and they do wind up in bed together, Ben says something that's supposed to be funny, but due to the recent transgender movement, would give crickets a louder sound than laughter in a modern audience.\n\nUnless \"Bennifer\" was your favorite couple and you're devastated that they broke up, there's no reason to watch this movie. Everything about it is in poor taste, even Al Pacino giving a caricature performance of himself.\n\nKiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to sexual content, I wouldn't let my kids watch it."

The movie is also chockful of swearing--Affleck must have said \"f***\" a few hundred times. The script is dull and stupid, the movie looks ugly and is directed with no style or taste by Martin Brest (after this and \"Meet Joe Black\" his career is probably gone). There's also a pointless, cruel and ugly scene with an ex of Lopez popping up. It adds nothing to the plot and just consists of three people swearing at each other at the top of their lungs. I'm no prude but really--the swearing in here goes overboard. This is also the type of movie where a lesbian finds Affleck so attractive she has no trouble having sex with him. If this were a good movie I would be offended--but it's not.\n\nThere are a few good things--Affleck and Lopez are actually good--their relationship was going strong when this movie was being shot and their affection for each other comes through. Affleck shows off his nice muscular body a few times--and he is a VERY handsome man. There is one funny moment with Lopez making small flirting gestures with another woman when Affleck is trying to post a package. But this whole movie is sunk by the direction and the script and a jaw-dropping ending which had me wanting to throw something heavy at my TV.\n\nAlso Christopher Walken pops up (lousy as always) but Lainie Kazan and Al Pacino(!!!) show up too and briefly kick start the movie.\n\nBut, all in all, this is a stupid, offensive, ugly, dull movie.

What chemistry!!!!\" Even a stinker like \"The Cell\" didn't garner the scorn it so deserved.\n\nWell, \"Gigli\" has done it. If this film doesn't bury J-Lo's career, then nothing will!\n\nPairing Affleck and Lopez (what a cute couple!!!!) was probably the biggest mistake since Franco Zefferili cast Adolph Hitler and Benito Mussolini in that delightful romp called \"World War II.\" I don't know (or care) if they are a publicity stunt in \"real life\" but these two phone their lines in. Ha ha money's in the bank. Suckers. The plot has something to do with a hitman (how original!) protecting somebody or another. You know, the plot is beside the point. They figured everybody would go see this bomb because it's got \"Ben and J-Lo\" in it! B AND J! B AND J! B AND J! BJ! BJ!\n\nNeedless to say, I was pulling out my eyebrows with a pair of red hot tweezers by the time the closing credits rolled down the screen. Nobody was left by then. Nobody. They were all gone.\n\nAll gone.\n\nThe stench was unbearable. The corpses littered the ground. The sky was red. Bloody red. Red.\n\nREDRUM."

I am not certain if absolutely nothing positive came from the couple\u0085 I don't really make it a point to look into the personal lives of celebrities\u0085 but if anything did, this was not it. Say it with me\u0085 just because two people work off screen does not mean they will on as well. Both of them having a poorly done accent each doesn't really help. The plot is never engaging and consistently utterly uninteresting. The pacing is drab. For the entirety of this picture, nothing whatsoever happens. This overstays its welcome something fierce. The language really felt thrown in, without any actual point to it. There are aspects of this that are just offensive. Walken and Pacino must be kicking themselves. Not a single scene is captivating or entertaining. The dialog is largely unimpressive, and holds no memorable or quotable lines. It also tries far too hard to sound eloquent. Filming and editing are average at best. Neither Lopez nor Affleck are particularly convincing. At least the latter doesn't hold any delusions of ability as a musician, and has proved himself an actual actor elsewhere. I recommend this solely to the biggest fans of Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck. Everyone else\u0085 you have been warned. 1/10"

The plot was ridiculous. And the script was nothing but tangent after tangent after tangent about baywatch and the vagina and Ben Affleck being a queer.

        "review_detailed_main": "When it starts; \"Gigli\" looks like an old comedy; like something from the eighties. There's a screen in blackout and a guy is talking some things; it looks like they're prepared to have fun. I'm sure they had a lot of fun, but I'm not sure if you will when you watch.\n\nI didn't have a lot of fun but the movie generates some laughs. You'll be killing me when you hear this, but it's some kind of unique experience. It was hated by everyone and it will be forever considered as one of the worst movies ever done; even when it's not that bad (as \"The Lord of the Rings\" will be considered one of the best movies ever even when it's not that good). Come on, you know there are other factors that made people reject this film. There's always a say about \"couples in real life don't have chemistry in movies\". This film's set made Affleck and Lopez fall in love. So, when the whole \"Bennifer\" thing started and this movie came up\u0085It didn't have a chance.\n\nHollywood is overly severe with some movies. Actually, the truth is that, even when the film hasn't got the most adequate sense of humor; and it doesn't dominate it correctly (because the script repeats the same jokes, and goes crazy with the bad words as \"fuck\" and \"shit\"), the film has the best intentions. There must have been a reason (if it wasn't checking out Jennifer's ass) for Walken and Pacino to choose these roles. Their performances become stereotypes and each of them appears only once in the whole film. Probably there was a deep interest in big names for the film, and there was a deep amount of cash. Walken and Pacino are not the same as they used to be (I've talked about that before).\n\nBen Affleck is the main star as Larry Gigli, a kind of gangster that works doing jobs that include killing people, taking money and other stuff. Affleck gives the role an incredible personality. He ends up owning the role; with his hair, his tone of voice (sometimes a little Italian)\u0085 I like to remember Affleck as Kevin Smith's boy or as the guy that co-wrote with Matt Damon the script of the amazing \"Good Will Hunting\". Does Gigli ever finish a job? We never see him doing it; but he claims to be the \"gangster of the gangsters\", when he gives and absurd speech as he tries to impress Ricki. She's played by Jennifer Lopez and that's not the character's real name. Lopez, as always puts her charming comedy skills over her looks. This wasn't exactly the most convenient choice, but I say it all the time, and I'll say it now: Jennifer Lopez is a fine (just because excellent or great are longer) actress. I've only missed two of her movies, and I love how she does it. Drop the acting career girl! The starter Justin Bartha (Brian) easily steals the film. I don't know if the retards are the ones that stand out in films where hardly the rest does (I'm talking about Leonardo Di Caprio's character in \"What's eating Gilbert Grape\"), but he gives a measured performance, without exceeding in something we've seen tons of times before. Just to say: Lenny Venito shouldn't be acting.\n\nAnd please, let's not bring down the man that brought Al Pacino to his best in \"Scent of a Woman\", took Eddie Murphy to success in \"Beverly Hills Cop\" and was behind Brad Pitt's very good (one of his best) performance in \"Meet Joe Black\". Yes, I'm talking about Martin Brest, who did this movie with the best intentions. His work is lame here, shooting the arm of one character and the face of another when two characters are talking; and making the actors walk to a determined part when they're going to talk so the camera can center them\u0085 The film's script is owner of an original storyline and different situations we haven't seen in a while. In the end, with the music and the stupid dramatic intensity, we realize: the film is obvious, manipulative; but somehow, you're waiting for Brian to take the jump."

It's your average idiotic young hood and I think he pulled it off. He's actually kinda funny. This movie reminded me a little bit of Excess Baggage. But that one was a little more interesting. The problem with something like this is that you can't figure out when it went wrong. It wasn't the actors and the whole premise seems a little silly so I figure it happened before the actors even got there. But why Ms. Lopez agreed to play this character with that dialogue has got to be the $64,000 question. But I don't think these two should have gotten railroaded the way they did. Neither one of them is a bad actor, even in this. If you haven't seen it I'm not going to recommend it but I saw a movie that was a lot worse than this last week and I had no warning. Be Cool was awful, but there was no backlash against the stars, so I had no idea. I'm not trusting critics ever again and neither should you.

Was the end-scenes a little sappy - Yes, but I think it did relieve the tensions of the rest of the story and placed the film in the Black Comedy category. As we all know Black Comedies are very hard to do right. Christopher Walkin and Al Pacino's cameos are a little distracting because they are so well known and powerful actors."

It's not even the worst film of the month, that honor would have to go to Tomb Raider 2 or even LXG. This is not a critics picture. This film is far to un-pc for any major critic to get away with giving it a passing grade. And yes, Lopez can't act. However, I went into the film thinking I was going to see some disaster, and instead, I got a nice surprise. Ben Affleck gives a very good performance in this film. Some of his lines had me laughing out loud, \"What the f- is this, mental illness week?\" The \"turkey time\" line is so bizarre and out of place, it made me laugh out loud. The ending is a little slow paced, but the film has a good enough sense of humor and it's heart is in the right place. I smiled a lot in Gigli. Christopher Walken and Al Pacino are a hoot. 8/10"

The overall storyline was interesting and there enough meat there to make it worth a matinee price at the theatre.\n\nIn honesty, Gigli is not nearly as bad as it has been panned to be. I believe that most people who think otherwise haven't seen the film in its entirety.\n\nThere is a good bit of foul language in Gigli - just to prep you for it, as I was fairly surprised by it. Also, the focal points of the film revolve around the mismanagement of a mentally handicapped person and the dynamics between a rebellious lesbian and a machismo male. What we've got here is (Pulp Fiction + Rain Man + Chasing Amy), and for the most part - it works.\n\nNot to leave the review without any criticism, I thought a good deal of the movie could've been left on the cutting room floor. The sheer number of highly enjoyable scenes should've been the focus of the movie. It reminded me of Kurosawa's \"Dreams\", which was packed full with memorable, vibrant imagery and storyline; but made you endure minutes after minutes of nothingness.\n\nOkay, the \"Dreams\" comparison was a bit of an exaggeration; but that's the ballpark that Gigli ends up with. More spotlighting of the quality moments and less time for the filler would've gone a long way."

Openly hating this movie is now an \"in thing\". People are actually paying money to be seen walking out during the movie. After the Gobble-gobble scene of coarse, where the entire crowd mocks Lopez doing their own turkey impersonations. The entire theater sounds like a turkey farm on the day before Thanksgiving!\n\nBut she has her fans, who may be calling \"Stop the J-Lo boycott!\". They faithfully watch the movie, shake their fists and cry \"U-Go girl!\" after every J-Lo wit and worse of all boo and hiss anyone who gets to their feet heading for the exit.\n\nThe truth is, the movie was doomed with extremely poor writing and directing. Was it a comedy, romance, drama, action? No, it was an ego feeding frenzy. Our money, the main course. Ask yourself: if J-Lo was offered 100% of the ticket sales, would she be grateful or insulted? C'mon you know the answer! And that too is why critics and the general population showed J-Lo and company no mercy, and no $$$. (0/10)\n\nLessons I learned: A movie title that is not easily pronounced is not cute. \"I am J-Lo. Love me!\" is not a magical incantation to bring box office success. Greedy movie execs are too afraid of J-Lo and would rather lose multiple millions of dollars rather than stand up to her even though their opinions are reinforced by millions of movie goers."

This is sad, for what the maddening crowds are missing is a film that hearkens back to Brest's more successful film Midnight Run, adding in a quirky romance with East Coast gangsters under L.A.'s palm trees. No, it is not perfect, but it is light-years more coherent than a Dude, Where's My Car, more emotionally real than an I Am Sam, and far better cast than a Road to Perdition. There were no witch-hunts for those films, and one was not warranted here. If you still have the chance, think for yourself and see this film, then see if you can still declare it a failure. I declare it a reasonable success, which is far better effort than most of what we get in American cinema these days."

Yes, there were many flaws to the film. The terrible acting of Ben Afflecks role and how the script put him all over the place. He was supposed to be a hardened thug, but failed bringing that to the screen miserably. Then what, a softened man under it all? How about we just say he's an average loser who is constantly trying to defend his masculinity, but apparently has none. The Lesbian hopping the fence for this guy? Really? I'm not sure what is more appalling, that someone really thinks a true lesbian would easily swap genders so easily or that Ben afflicts character was soooo enticing that he could win over any gender? And the portrayal of a handicap kid. Wow. I know this is where they were trying to pull the heart strings, but I don't think it would have went over that smoothly from taking someone with such a disability out of their comfort zone and routine...\n\nThere were some things about the movie that was appealing. I liked the dynamic that Jennifer Lopez portrayed with Ben Affleck. Her role was very masculine when it came to power dynamics. She was never equal with any man, but always above them. She didn't fear them, didn't need to be rescued, she held her ground and acted as though she was above them. It's rare to see those power dynamics in romance comedy, not only was she equal, with Affleck, but she was above him. Jennifer did a good job with her role. She was sexy, powerful, and very well spoken with witty lines. But with that said some might find that annoying, She always came across as putting Affleck down, instead of meeting him in the middle. One fatal flaw even with the power dynamics in reverse, Jennifer never came across as a violent person. She was playing the role of a hired thug, but not for one moment did I believe she would harm a soul."

There are a few comedic parts but they are too few. It comedic style is subtle dark humour and situational.\n\nHad the director sped it up an element of farce could have emerged, but I believe it was slowed for dramatic effect or in some parts to create a more heartening experience. Which is fine with comedies involving complex plot lines or wit, but for a film such as this, it made it tedious to sit through, especially since it is a long flick.\n\nThe script needed revising, and editing could have removed a large chunk of the film and it would have improved a lot. Some scenes really didn't need to be in the film as they didn't add to the story.\n\nJ-Lo does ok, but unfortunately Ben's performance as a semi-brained mobster was not convincing. The Leisure Suite Larry background music and blank silences added to what people would consider a bad film and is probably one of the reasons it was reviewed so lowly by so many people.\n\nMost Hollywood films have a run of the gun style production, faster, more action and bigger is better. I think the intension of this film was the opposite and tries to give a more 'real' feel to the film, different to the normal tripe the leads are usually cast in. Again, it doesn't really work in Gigli, but the style doesn't always make a bad film.\n\nGigli is watchable its just unlikely to be on anyone's best film list."

I found the film somewhat emotional due to the cruelty Larry Gigli puts the poor disabled kid through (I have two kids of my own, and to even imagine talking to them like he does to the kid in this movie is heartbreaking) and the ending where the kid finally gets to see \"the Baywatch\" made me somewhat misty-eyed.

Adversely the speeches about sexuality in the film along with the tension between Larry and Ricki don't work. The previews for this film were a cheat, they didn't even hint at the real story. While the acting is mediocre, it is not the weakest point in the film. Some parts were comical, but largely the writing along with the lack of real character development ruins the potential for the comedy the audience thought is was going to get from the previews. If they were to remake the film, they would need to take out Ricki's dilemmas with her sexuality and cut down on the cussing to make it a success. I realize the cussing was an attempt at life-like conversation in that occupation, but you need to be able to understand the other words coming out of the characters mouth in order to get the story. Definitely not one of the best films of the 21st century."

        "review_detailed_main": "First let me say if you haven't seen this movies based solely off the reviews, then you may as well not have your own opinion about anything. The movie isn't even half as bad as the critics made it sound. Clearly, they let all the Bennifer backlash obscure their thoughts. Was it amazingly fantastic? No. But it doesn't deserve to be on a list for one of the worst movies of all time. The movie is about a hit-man and a lesbian hit-woman, if you will, and how they have to watch over a mentally disabled boy they have kidnapped. The plot line is a little all over the place and I don't think the movie really needed to be two hours long, but all in all it wasn't that bad. Ben Affleck acted what he was given, sure sometimes he was a bit over the top, but that was his character. I'm not sure why everyone was so surprised by Jennifer Lopez's performance. Every single character she has ever acted has been the same. So to expect her to all of a sudden deliver something mind-blowing is stupid on your part. I'm not bashing her by any means, just know what to expect. She also was in the most amazing shape I have ever seen her in. If you're a guy, that should be reason enough right there to see the movie. The lack of chemistry between them people keep talking about I sure didn't see. I felt the chemistry. There were parts where you can catch Ben Affleck almost smirking at Jennifer Lopez. A look where you could tell he really was smitten over her. Another part the critics slammed was how a lesbian fell for a guy. \"That is so unrealistic\". How many movies are realistic? I mean are we kidding?? It's a movie. I thought Justin Bartha did a great job in his role as the mentally disabled boy. I found it totally believable and the movie ended perfectly for him. The two cameos, Christopher Walken and Al Pacino, were completely unnecessary and odd. I enjoy both of them as actors very much, but there was no point for them to be in the movie. Basically, I have no intention of owning this flick, but I feel it has been picked on over and over again because of a few opinions. Which in turn made everyone else give it bad reviews, because it would be insanity for anyone to think an original thought on their own. Go see the movie and decide for yourself."

I had heard that this was one of the worst movie's of all time, but I honestly found that hard to believe. This film didn't leave me with anger or depression, it just left me confused.\n\nOK, first off, Affleck and J-Lo do not work together. It's not because they're bad actors or anything, something else stopped the relationship from blooming. Every single time this movie tried to have a sweet moment between the two, they played it for laughs. I have seen straight comedies do a better job of being romantic than this. The gangster part doesn't make sense, I don't want to spoil anything, but there is a very easy way for this movie to just end very early on. Speaking of which, why was this movie two hours long? It didn't need to be. And there are a bunch of character's that have no purpose and just flat out disappear: Christopher Walken, J-Lo's lesbian girlfriend, the mob boss. As well as several character traits, such as Gigli being a screw up. Also, is this film saying that lesbians can be actracted to gay men and vice versa? I will give it this though, it can be funny at times. Justin Bartha can get some laughs, although half the time he speaks so fast I couldn't understand what he was saying. But I did laugh I descent amount of times I guess. And some of the dialogue was interesting, you know, when they weren't talking about genitals to try and make character development.\n\nGigli fails as a romance, and it fails as a gangster flick. As a comedy, it's meh. To be fair I wasn't mad while watching it, but it wasn't even so bad it was good. Yeah it had it's funny moments, but it could get really dull. Not recommended. Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but pretty bad."

I just want to offer my gratitude to the makers for producing such a horrific film that the fall out from it shattered the loathsome \"bennifer\" pairing, and seemed to put the first nail in the coffin of the amazingly untalented Ms Lopez's career. Nevertheless, this is the most crass, turgid, dismally written, horrifically acted, shoddily directed, poorly shot and badly conceived feature that ever obtained an actual cinema release. For God's sake nobody watch the movie all the way through; just watch the infamous \"gobble\" scene- it encapsulates everything that has been commented on."

I actually saw two higher profile movies last summer that were worse yet they somehow avoided this kind of backlash. The bottom line problem is that Affleck and Lopez are too famous to hide into characters. We see this ubiquitous pair as Bennifer and it's hard to accept them as anything else. The second problem deals with some of the plot devices such as the implausibility that Lopez' character, who is presumably a hardnosed hitwoman, would suddenly change her sexuality for an inferior hitman. At first, I also found the movie to be hard to follow. What keeps this from being the worst movie I have ever seen are the cameos from Walken, Pacino, Missy Crider, and Lainie Kazan. I also thought that Justin Bartha's performance allowed this movie to have a heart. Lopez and Affleck's performances were not bad (Lopez giving the better performance of the two) but it's just you can no longer see beyond their public personas. Lopez is actually a good actress who had a lot of promise before she became J-Lo but now she is too famous. The movie was simply okay, not great, not good, not worst I have ever seen, but okay."

        "review_detailed_main": "I just had to see this film even after the avalanche of the worst revues this side of \"Freddie Got Fingered\". Story is about a small time hood named Larry Gigli (Ben Affleck) who works for Louis (Lenny Venito), a mob guy in Los Angeles and he tells Larry to kidnap a young man named Brian (Justin Bartha) who has that \"Rain Man\" condition and he does and takes him back to his apartment. Later, there is a knock on his door and its Ricki (Jennifer Lopez) who doesn't give her correct name and says that Louis sent her over to help out with watching Brian and make sure Larry doesn't screw things up. The two of them share his bed but Ricki tells him to forget any romantic thoughts because she's a lesbian. He's very attracted to her and one day Ricki's lover barges in to his apartment and thinks they are sleeping together. She cuts her wrists and they take her to the hospital. While there, they go down to where they store bodies and get a thumb off a corpse because they are suppose to cut off one of Brian's thumbs but they kind of like him. One morning Louis calls and they are to meet this other mob guy (Al Pacino) from New York. At his place the guy shoots Louis because the wrong thumb was sent! This film was directed and written by Martin Brest who usually presents films about mis-matched pairs like \"Scent of a Woman\" and \"Midnight Run\" and \"Beverly Hills Cop\" and here he tries the same thing. Well, its a total failure and it fails on so many levels. While I agree that Affleck and Lopez do not have much chemistry, I believed that Affleck's character would be attracted to her even on a simple sexual infatuation. Lopez spends the entire film in the skimpiest outfits and one more centimeter lower and Lopez's ass crack would have been shown. If she's not wearing skimpy outfits then she's doing yoga and showing off her great body. Lopez doesn't really act here, she just poses. I know some like to badmouth Affleck's acting talent but I'm not one of those. I do think he is a good actor and at times he showed glimpses of his talent but its to no avail because they both have to recite the most inane dialogue in movie history \"Gobble Gobble\" and not at a moments time does it come across as believable. I've never really liked hitmen films and I thought \"Grosse Point Blank\" was a waste of time. The only one I liked was \"Prizzi's Honor\". Bartha as Brian is just an annoying plot device and only in bad films does a person with a condition like his look that good. Christopher Walken shows up and tries what appears to be some improvisation but his whole scene seems forced like Brest was forced to write a scene for him. Lopez is not only unbelievable as a mobster but she's unconvincing as a lesbian as well. The ending at the beach goes on and on! You keep waiting for it to end and the scene goes on for at least 10 or 15 more minutes! What happened? Did the editor of the film fall asleep? The pacing of the film is ponderous and the actors do what I like to call \"Clunk Around\" like a broken piece of something caught in a machines gears. Even the music was bad, it sounded like that background music you hear in all mob or heist films. Martin Brest is a respectable director but you have to seriously wonder what he was thinking."

This movie goes wrong in so many ways. First off, let's face it, Ben Affleck isn't exactly what you'd call a \"Good\" actor, the only really fun thing about Ben is that he's able to make fun of himself in Kevin Smith movies- except for Jersey Girl- but that's something else completely. Lucky for Ben, he ends up being paired with an actor that usually can carry the movie, and cover the Affleck, and even make a Ben Affleck Movie slightly more interesting- well - even Charlize Theron couldn't save Reindeer Games - but I'm straying again. Jennifer Lopez is pretty much the same. She is a better actress than she is a singer, and that's not saying much, but two bad leads and a horrible story make for an unbearable viewing experience.\n\nIt's hard to explain where the movie starts to go wrong (besides casting)- but after about 10 minutes of watching this piece of crap, you'll wonder why you haven't turned off the TV. What's sadder is that the movie seems to try desperately to get the viewer to cling unwilling through a totally useless tag-a-long with Turret's syndrome- which is only funny if your eight (a la Deuce Bigelow)- and Lopez's Lesbian turns Straight (or Bi is you like) is pathetic! But the fun doesn't stop there, there isn't one thing that can be said about this movie - seriously - even the title causes many problems- that should be a sign - but that didn't stop me.\n\nMy Advice? If you decide to watch this movie - do it out of morbid curiosity, it's not even worth making fun of - just terrible."

J-Lo is a dyke hitwoman who's all over Ben after the obligatory iciness (she must have forgotten the script said she's a LESBIAN, L-E-S-B-I-A-N). They kidnap a retarded Tourette's syndrome kid whose brother's a bigshot D.A. So presumably the kid's pic is all over the news, but that doesn't stop J-Lo & Ben from parading him all over town in a convertible (!) when they're not letting him cavort in front of a huge, highly visible picture window in their apartment or taking him to the beach or the store or a hospital. Even when they kidnap him from \"the home\" there's not a soul in sight to prevent it - no nurses, doctors, nothing. Didn't they have a continuity (or logic) person on the set who could've pointed this out? Good grief.\n\nSchmaltz reigns supreme, with lots of swelling heavenly choruses, a cliche \"redemption of the retard\" angle, and J-Lo and Ben duking it out for the painfully long close-ups time, with the lion's share, inexplicably, going to Ben. Embarrassing scenes of Ben flexing shirtless in front of a mirror for what seems like hours, calling himself \"the bull!\" (J-Lo's his \"cow\" in his mind) will work your last nerve. Lots of faux-New Age chatter about Ben's possible \"feminine side\" and J-Lo wanting him to put on mascara. Gigli (\"rhymes with really\" as fluttery-eyed Ben keeps reminding us) is cheese, and given the last-minute press screenings the filmmakers must know. They should be scared. It's so boring it doesn't even rise to Guilty Pleasure status. Strictly for masochists or hopeless (certifiable) devotees of either of the two stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "I won't try to pretend that this is a good film. Quite how not one, not two, but three Academy Award winners came to participate in Gigli is a conundrum the solution to which ought to result in a Nobel Prize. Not pointing any fingers, but the characterisation, direction and plot are all AWOL. It would appear that every poor soul appearing in front of the camera decided to ham it up in the hope that it would complement the inescapable cheese that crops up in every frame.\n\nThat said, I believe that this film is destined for greatness. This is \"Showgirls\" for the gangster genre, a one star film that gets an extra star for effort. There are more laughs (admittedly unintentional) in this movie than in the last three Farrelly Bros. movies combined. At times jaw dropping in its absurdity (the infamous \"gobble, gobble\" invitation issued by J-Lo is a pale shadow of the other direlogue on offer here), this (romantic thriller? crime caper? redemptive drama? who knows what the creators were thinking?) is the kind of movie to watch while sitting round with a bunch of mates and an overabundance of snacks brimming with E-numbers. The comedy is cruelly underlined by the thin veneer of resigned desperation that inhabits every scene. In fact only the former Miss Lo appears to be playing it completely straight, apparently oblivious to the cinematic Rome in flames around her, and as a result, she gives her most enjoyable performance since Out Of Sight.\n\nScenes to look out for include the Incident In The Diner, Yoga Before Bedtime and J-Lo On The Art Of War. I would also like to give a special mention to the fine individuals in charge of the music \u0096 for those of us who are blind (and lobotomised) the sound editing team have done a Grade A job of adding ceaseless crescendos of 'heart-warming' music, thus kindly providing the audience with emotional cues. Add to this the fact that J-Lo is possibly the worst lesbian in the history of cinema, and one half of the most inept pair of career criminals ever to sully the good name of organised crime, and what you have is a film that will form the keystone of many a student DVD collection for years to come. In fact, the only real criticism is that the film is about twenty minutes too long (but even here, the 'dramatic' pauses will no doubt have you smirking into your carbonated beverage). But Gigli: The Director's Cut? Now that's on my must have list"

As I find myself liking, at least to some extent, most of the films I see, I wanted to see what a bad film was like. Overall, it was bad, but not truly awful as I had heard (#3 on the IMDB top 100 worst movies, as I'm sure you've seen). There was very minimal character development, and even then it was so spasmodic it left your head spinning. As if your head wasn't spinning enough, they throw in these random characters, without introducing them, who speak so you can't understand them. The third time this happened, I almost rewound the scene to turn on the subtitles so I could have at least a vague idea what the man had said. This leaves the viewer without a clue as to what's going on with the plot. The characters seemed completely unconvincing. For instance, a mentally retarded character that has an affinity with cursing and is highly focused on sex. The dialogue was in some cases utterly stupid. \"In every relationship there is a bull and there is a cow. I am the bull!\" Some cases it was just bad. Some parts were so stupid that you weren't sure if you were supposed to laugh or not. The scene leading up to the sex scene was entirely clich\u00e9. J-Lo conveniently doing stretches on the floor in very suggestive poses while Affleck talks about his genitalia. Some redeeming qualities: I personally really enjoyed the music in the film. It fit in nicely with the scene. Also, the ending was good, even though the plot throughout the rest of the film was pretty dumb. Bottom line: somewhere between \"terrible\" and \"wait for home video.\" 4/10."

The love story of Benifer had me sobbing while the dirty jokes cleverly disguised by the idiosyncrasies of a retard had me laughing for days! Al Pacino's scene was reminiscent of his earlier works like the \"Godfather\" and \"Heat\", simply brilliant.

Lo showing up is waste of time and slow the film. Some dialogues could have been cut short, but I found many funny and witty. In the scene with Walken, Lopez can be seen as really worried. On the other hand in the scene with Pacino, she is little too scared or surprised for a contract killer. The main problem is that Lopez as a mob enforcer is not believable."

The rambling profanity of the characters makes them as lovable and understandable as the stereotypical homeless bag lady with the shopping cart, cursing at someone who doesn't exist as she walks down some back alley.\n\nPerhaps a plot--or less than 9 simultaneous plots--might have helped. None of these stylish, overplayed, completely flat characters were convincing, and more often insulting to the characters they stole from. I truly believe, from the Baywatch references in the movie, that this was a Cliff's Notes primer on Money Train, Chasing Amy, and Rain-Man, for those that never saw the films, and don't waste time concerning themselves with content or depth.\n\nI had the same feeling watching this movie as \"The Browning Version\", but not for the same reasons. The Browning Version is a wonderfully depressing movie--it starts out with the characters in a bad situation, then slowly draws you farther and farther down into devastation. You do this by participating with the characters. Gigli--well, you do this from the third party perspective. Either way--near the end, you're ready to end it all.\n\nJust before the climactic ending of Gigli, my son asked me \"do you keep looking for the bots on the front row?\" I must admit, I had already thought of Manos twice. We went directly home and watched it--and within two minutes were already laughing at \"imaginary elves\" in the Chevy training film. It was the first time I'd heard him laugh, and realized it was the first time I'd laughed as well.\n\nDoesn't that fact prove that Gigli is worse than Manos? Try it, Manos MST3k is an uplifting experience after Gigli.... Yikes!!! This means that Brest is now the master!!! Would HE approve? jeez... Affleck playing Michael, Rain-Man playing Torgo, Lopez playing both Margaret and Debbie at the same time! She can handle that--there's not a full character between them, and she's more than qualified to play less than a full character (Money Train)\n\nThat's it, use the same cast!! Remake Manos!!! Lousy stories, plenty of style, awkward sexual situations...eh...wait...that's Gigli.\n\nI guess I'm just angry I didn't get my Chevy Salesman training short in front of Gigli."

You should definitely watch it because you will realise that no matter how depressing things may seem (or, sadly, indeed be), no matter how low you feel, once you have watched this film you can comfort yourself with the thought that it is unlikely that you will ever produce anything (in any walk of life)quite as dire as Gigli. There's no point in exploring the plot; no point in decrying the number of star names who took part in this film (was the money THAT good?); no point in wondering why this did not bring to a definite end the careers of Mr Affleck and Ms Lopez. No, there is no point in all of that because that will all occur naturally. No, I believe the important point is to accept that the purpose of this film is to indulge in celluloidal schadenfreude, and that it is perfectly OK to laugh at (or at least be mildly amused by) every attempt by either of the main protagonists to utter lines intended to be serious (and in certain scenes - I cannot conceive how they thought that they had achieved this - profound). I have but one serious point to punctuate the revelry - Justin Bartha is really very good (and that is not simply because of who he is acting alongside) - so except him, but don't let that spoil the fun. Enjoy..."

To me, it's more of a comedy (any movie where someone sings Baby Got Back should automatically be classified as a comedy). If you go see the movie, expect to see a move more like Made than Goodfellas. The title alone should give that away...giggly?...jiggly?...jeely?...what?. This movie is just a victim of poor marketing and Ben and Jen bashers. I'm not a fan of theirs but I am of this movie. I guarantee you'll be taking quotes from this film and having a ton of laughs with your friends.\n\nThis isn't Glitter."

Only they jacked it all up: instead of cute kid, we'll go with a retard. Instead of gorgeous woman, we'll make her a lesbian, so we don't have to explain why she's unavailable--plus, it'll make her even hotter! It was almost sad, especially since it was the beginning of the end for Bennifer I, and there was so much hype around the movie. The only thing that makes this movie worth seeing, and makes a great story to tell at parties, is the \"she makes my penis sneeze\" line. Now THAT was funny! And, since you'll be the only person you know that's seen the movie, it will always be a fresh and original joke."

The movie is a collection of bad acting, supported by a script that writer/director Martin Brest must have written while having a \"philosopher-wannabe\" crisis.\n\nIn the end, the story of the rude gangster Gigli -- played by our favorite bad actor ever, Ben Affleck -- and a lesbian who is helping him with the kidnapping of the brother of an important politician. She is played by Jennifer Lopez. Jennifer is simply charming and sexy, and I think she'll get out of this bomb without any bad bruises. But Ben Affleck killed his career here. Thank God, I wouldn't stand any more \"Daredevil\" movies.\n\nAnd I would love to say that the cameos by Al Pacino, Christopher Walken and Lainie Kazan saved the movie, but that won't be possible. They're just as bad. So, watch it if you're a Jennifer Lopez fan, she's O.K. here.\n\nMy final analysis: along with \"Elektra\" and \"Glitter\", this is one of the worst \"movie-mess\" of the decade. Avoid!"

His portrayal as low level thug was believable as much as Denise Richards' performance as nuclear scientist in TWINE. Same could be said for Jennifer Lopez's performance as a hitwoman. And a lesbian.\n\n2. Affleck and J. Lo may be a couple in real life, but they should not play lovers in the movies. They had absolutely no \"spark\" whatsoever between them. I was going to say they shouldn't appear together altogether, but they will appear in upcoming Jersey Girl, so I'll refrain myself from that comment for now.\n\n3. The actor who played Brian shouldn't act again. He gave probably the most annoying performance that I've seen in years. And his character was supposed to be sweet and endearing.\n\n4. No movie studio should let Martin Brest to write and direct his own script ever again. I admit I like Scent of a Woman, but Meet Joe Black and this movie are the perfect examples that his scripts are interminable bores, and in Gigli it's inept as well.\n\n5. Having said all that above, it's not the worst movie ever made. It's not even the worst movie of 2003. That would be Dreamcatcher in my humble opinion. At least it deserves some credit for letting Christopher Walken and Al Pacino to act like loons."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I picked up \"Gigli\" at the local Blockbuster, I did not have high expectations. I thought to myself. \"Eh, this has Al Pacino in it, why not give it a try?\" When I was done with the film, I was a different person. This movie has bolstered me and made me a more mature and sensible person. This film is a true work of art, and a model for all things cinematography.\n\nFirst off, the acting was simply a perfection. I had to keep reminding myself that I was indeed just watching a fictional movie, and this was not a real-life experience. Affleck's and Lopez's impersonations of their characters were absolutely incredible. It seemed as if they did not just assume the roles of their characters, but if they had taken on their souls and hearts and came out in the bodies of actors. Affleck's performance in particular struck me as unforgettably real, and I , once again, I had to keep telling myself that Ben was just an actor, and not a real-life street thug.\n\nJLo's impersonation of Ricki, a sweet-voiced lesbian gangster, is quite simply out of this world. I was literally knocked off my feet during the Oscars, when she did not win the Best Actress. I kept crying and beating my head against the bathtub, so deep was my offense with the public's judgment of this extraordinary actress.\n\nThe plot is simply brilliant. This movie is a an action-packed drama,while at the same time being a romantic comedic thriller. As we move deeper into Affleck's deep, dark, mysterious personality, and find out more about his unbelievable past, we learn to love this seemingly crude thug, as we realize what a lovable, smart, down-to-earth, courageous, and decisive gentleman he really is. As for Jennifer Lopez, we are first shocked by her independence, her incredible ability to compromise (\"Let's try to make this nice\"), and her sexual manipulation of men.The audience is driven to tears as we learn Ricki's insecurities, as she does not want Gigli to learn her real name . These fears are so unbelievably real that virtually anyone on Earth can relate to them.\n\nThe relationship of Ben Affleck and Justin Bartha eerily mirrors that of Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman in \"Rain Man\". The parallel of a tough, protective older figure and the feeble-minded genius is so real, I kept telling myself that this was indeed a different movie. Also, Ben Affleck portrayal of a city's gangster is virtually identical to that of Al Pacino in the \"Scarface\". A true, baller, hustler, gangster, a killer who has no regard for the cost of human life, a man who does not fear anything, a man who is indifferent to pain or pleasure , a hit-man who can meet with Triumph and Disaster and treat those two impostors just the same, and so hold on, when there is nothing in him, except the will which says to him , \"Hold on!\", Ben Affleck is cruel, merciless, ambitious, and undeniable street thug, the ultimate gangster.\n\nOverall, this film took cinematography to the next level. \"Godfather\", \"Casablanca\", and \"Goodfellas\", \"Scarface\", and \"Citizen Kane\", make some room-Gigli is here to stay."

What were Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez thinking when they thought this would go over well? Not only was the writing bad, but a behind-the-screen love affair between the two \"stars\" didn't help either. Martin Brest must have been wasted or something close to it when he directed this. The only redeeming quality to this movie is that Jennifer Lopez is hot and we got to look at her for entertainment. If there was anything lower than a one, that's what I would give it. A -10, about that low. If Lopez wasn't in it, wow, that number makes my brain hurt."

Indeed, Lopez' entire persona has been of the 'knows where she's going, remembers where she came from' variety, and she aims to be all things to all people (at least, all people with some expendable cash in their pockets). So, film of the year, Gigli is not. The cast looks bewildered, the script is insane, and both leads have gotten so good at faking on-screen chemistry that it's embarrassing. But that's nothing new.

The pop corn was very good and Benny in its best role has life. Really, it goes ate all the Oscars. By the way, J.Lo which goes ate the Oscar of the best actress for a 9th year of continuation. I know there very well out of film because I am a redactor of the Tribune. The sound screen never as well make move my basin. The music is really entrainante that you cannot to any more you arreter of dancer. Then see this film as often as possible to try to include/understand all the tasty dialogue of Benny and J.Lo in this film which is a psychological drama and horror.\n\nP.S: The end is not badly believed for the heart."

Ben has once again picked a real winner of a movie idea. Yeah...he's the guy I want in my corner when I win the next Project Greenlight...lol. Truthfully, I wasn't shocked at all to see that this dismal motion picture had made it all the way to the top of the \"Bottom 100 of all time\" films. J-lo as a lesbian doesn't work. I would have enjoyed it more if they cast Rosie O'Donnell as Ben s love interest. In fact, this could have been a block buster if it had been Ben Stiller and Rosie O'Donnell or Ellen DeGeneris! NOT! Jen's Cutesy \"Gobble, Gobble\" line almost got me to leave the theatre, but like all who love to watch a good car wreck, I had to stay 'til the bitter end. I think casting Mr. Affleck as a Hit Man was a very bad mix too. He should have just whacked himself in the opening scene and I could have stayed home and save $7.50. These two people are way too full of themselves to be for real. Truthfully, my theory on the whole thing is this: They both took little or no salary to do the film in return for a % of the gross. ( ben is famous for this routine ) then the editing process began and the 2 realized that they messed up majorly for not taking the money and running. So they conjured up this \"relationship\" thinking they would be the talk of the universe (which they were) and people would go to see the film regardless of its appeal. Then once the film opened, they could go their seperate ways (ie the stripper story in last week's Enquirer). Now they will break up and maybe sympathy will rouse video & DVD sales next week when this trash is yanked from the once Silver Screen. There's my 2 centablos. Stick to singin' and shakin' J-lo. And Ben, stay where you belong too >"

I heard the buzz and read the bad reviews but deep down I thought it couldn't be that bad - how wrong I was!!\n\nI think it would be fair to start with the positive points - Jennifer Lopez is by far the best thing in this movie and she is the one positive. Despite this, she has quite possibly one of the worst lines in celluloid history (think poultry).\n\nNow to the other side of the coin. This was billed as a Ben Affleck-Jennifer Lopez movie and as such, there were always people who were going to hate this movie. However, the dialogue is so bad (in fact, its hard to express just how bad it really is) that you sometimes you laugh at the badness but the laughter just masks the bitterness at having spent money on this. Now to Ben Affleck, I really don't know what has happened to him since Shakespeare In Love and Good Will Hunting but his acting appears to consist of pulling faces of various levels of pain. This is no exception. The rest of characters are just charactures - Ben Affleck's mother, the mad lesbian, the retard, Louis (who appears to have wandered off the set of Miami Vice) and in some cases are downright offensive. Much has been made of the cameo appearances of Christopher Walken and Al Pacino - they do not make this movie. Walken appears to be on smack or dumbstuck at his agent's stupidity and Pacino just shouts his way through his bit.\n\nIt was just dreadful and if I never see this movie again it will be too soon."

Insipid storyline.\n\nThe Jennifer Lopez marketing machine rolls on. But, as we all know, it's not about quality in Hollywood, it's about money. Stay as far away from this POS as you possibly can, you'll be a better person for it.\n\nThis is not just ordinary bad in a 'Bad Boys II' sort of way, but a hypnotic, black hole of a movie that sucks reputations, careers and goodwill down its vortex. Rarely has a movie that doesn't star Madonna achieved such a skin-crawling mixture of deluded 'look at me, I'm a star' and bungled humour.\n\nBad Ben plays a low-level Italian-American enforcer, living in Los Angeles, who is named Larry Gigli. To signify his retro macho values, he wears striped bowling shirts and a pompadour of a Grease extra, shrugs and waves his hands and shouts a lot. In the mob world he inhabits, apparently devoid of other Italian-Americans or opera fans, no one can pronounce his surname which, he explains \"rhymes with 'really.' \" Creative writing at its finest.\n\nSoon the humour really begins to boil. Gigli's perpetually irascible boss Lou (Lenny Venito) assigns him to kidnap the teenaged, brain-damaged younger brother (Justin Bartha) of the district attorney in an attempt to pressure him to drop charges against a New York gang boss.\n\nBack at his one-bedroom apartment, Gigli yells at Brian, who spouts obscenities back until the doorbell rings. Enter Bad Jennifer Lopez, whose major contributions to the film are front and back cleavage. She calls herself Ricki, and she has been sent by Lou to make sure that Gigli doesn't screw up his assignment.\n\nHer character, devoid of any believable history, quotes Sun Tzu (yeah, right!) and threatens unruly teens by sashaying up to them in her miniskirt and describing a fictional martial-arts move that tears out the visual cortex and deprives its victim of all visual memory.\n\nWatch this movie to completion and the procedure may actually sound tempting.\n\nThe scene with Al Pacino as the New York mobster, is a lesson for all in truly large-scale bad acting. Initially, Pacino vamps like a swish fashion designer and then spends the rest of the scene bellowing (gee, there's a stretch).\n\nApart from the movie's wordy, tasteless dialogue, awkward pacing and tacked-on ending, the biggest failing is the misguided celebrity casting. Both Affleck and Lopez are light-as-a-bubble presences, marginably bearable when attached to stronger actors, but they're hopelessly out of place in a character-driven black comedy."

The plot drags along slowly. It's terribly long. A bad movie can make time stand still. Gigli is such an unlikable character, Riki is stiff, and they have no chemistry together. His treatment of Brian is cringe-worthy and Brian is no treat either. The three lead characters sound like a bad joke; a meat-head, a lesbian, and a retard. I feel like this movie is begging for somebody like Tarantino to make the dialog sing. I don't think Martin Brest is capable of doing the writing that is required.

        "review_detailed_main": "Martin Brest focused the \"serious-funny side\". Besides Brians historical disability highlights even the other characters more social disability of 'unsocial', onesided traits of 'autism'. While they have to play unchanged their part, the members of the 'family'-team Brian, Larry and Ricki develop tools to take care their disability.The mysterious out-of-the-blue Ricki is gentleminded, beautiful and must be \"someone who can look you right in the eye and tell you exactly what she's thinking, someone who doesn't care what you think about her.\" With her sense of coolness, and logic she can see through the front-mirrors in this Gigli-movie. It is precisely this what Larry's show-off attitude needs for his development. Brest about Larry Gigli: \"The most important thing was to create a central character who is stuck in time, who has somehow missed the opportunity to grow and progress\u0085 a man that time forgot, someone who, despite his good looks and charm, lives in the past and is a bit removed from his contemporaries\u0085His peers have moved on, gotten married, started families, and Gigli is still at his two-bit job, living alone in a dumpy apartment. Somewhere along the way, he took the wrong road and he's stuck. So he postures, covers up, tries to pretend he's a tough guy.\" For Brian is 'Baywatch' not the TV-show but the life where normal people are, not longing to be part of it, he is aware of his situation, but be accepted for what he is. His togethertime with Larry and Ricki gives him the tool to handle 'Baywatch'-reality when he finally is a part of it. Not the goal \u0096 the journey transforms this timeout-'family', offers human approach to each other. The lesson: if each one of them accepts the other, the lesbian, the tough guy and the handcapped can be handicapped, lesbian and the tough guy. When Brian has finally to proof the use of his tool as short-time-member of the 'Baywatch'-team \u0096 it does not happen in Rainman's autistic \"wet kiss\"-style, though Brian cites for the astonished girl the Australian weatherforecast, Brian uses the right tool for the right person in the right moment at the right place; tool, person, time and place interact together. To be disability-accepted is mainly \u0096 not only!!! \u0096 the responsibility of society, but foremost the confronted individual in focus \u0096 here it is the girl. Not Larry Gigli is the turning-point in this 'bad' Gigli-movie but Brian. They search for and find a way to communicate with Brian, sensing what to do, has to be done and is done until Brian is ready when 'Baywatch' opens. After the Starkman-scene everything is done and said. Being Peace rules. Brian is, until his brother and his people come, a 'Baywatch'-member. And Larry is ready, as good as it is possible for him, catching up time and the others. And Ricki reveals her real name, inviting him to be with her, to be wherever it is 'clean' and as long as it lasts for them. The book Rochelles Ricki reads is Being Peace by Thich Nhat Hanh. The first lines of the first chapter On Suffering highlight what the movie Gigli aimed at. Without denying suffering, Brian and Ricki show Larry-boy how a 'father' could be, seeing the wonders of life. \"Life is filled with suffering, but it is also filled with many wonders, like the blue sky, the sunshine, the eyes of a baby. To suffer is not enough. We must also be in touch with the wonders of life. They are within us and all around us, every where, any time\" Being Peace Thich Nhat Hanh"

The portrayal of the young mentally disabled boy was well acted, and the heartwarming heart of the movie - he did find his \"Baywatch\" which kind of gives hope. . .as one who was lonely in early life, I very much identified with the young boy calling the weather in Australia - I think I used to call the weather in New York City, because as a young boy I was stuck and lonely in Canton, Ohio. . .it made me feel less isolated to feel for a few moments that I was somewhere else.\n\nAs for people who wanted so much more from this movie, I just say - Hey this IS Hollywood - if you want a philosophical meaning of life movie, rent something from Europe."

        "review_detailed_main": "Before I start this review, let me say that when it comes to the whole \"Bennifer\" story I remain neutral. I never cared about Hollywood romances and never will, so I approached this movie with no bias against or for them. I was aware of all the extremely negative press this film had been receiving, so I saw this little title out of curiosity. Like all other potential Razzie candidates, I try to keep an open-mind when watching these films. For example, I'm one of the few that enjoyed Little Nicky quite a bit and still think the Razzies were off their rocker nominating this over real crap like Dungeons and Dragons. Upon renting the DVD from the store, popping it into the player and hitting 'Play', a whole new world of pain erupted.\n\nGigli is not as bad as the critics have been saying, it's much worse and cannot be describe with any word in the English language relating to \"bad\"\n\nThis has got to be one of the most painfully paced, poorly scripted and horrendously acted films that have ever met the camera lens. I still cannot get it through my head that a studio spent 85 MILLION on this one project alone, what the hell did they spend the budget on when the film mostly took place in Gigli's apartment? Oh, of course...the addition of new respected Oscar-winning actors to the project, (more on that later). First off, let me just say that Martin Brest has got to stop pretending he's Quentin Tarantino because he just cannot compare to a man who has Pulp Fiction under his belt. Tarantino creates characters that we can respect and relate to...Brest creates a mentally-challenged character who is a cheap shot to anyone with the affliction. Tarantino writes excellent scripts that contain careful detail and develop characters to their full potential...Brest creates a scene where Lopez talks about her reproductive organ and includes the line \"It's turkey time. Come on, gobble gobble.\". I just feel dirty for typing that line alone when I could have used that memory to write something intelligent.\n\nThe acting is nothing more than a waste, and when it is used it is horribly executed. Lopez needs to read the script and understand who her character is. She cannot go from design-to-design changing from a sensitive figure to a serious fighter failing at every turn. Ben Affleck needs to break out, I see some degree of potential in him...yes, you heard me...and needs to find what he's good at and work at that. As for the rest of the cast, I want to ask a serious question: how did Christopher Walken and Al Pacino end up in this film when they have an incredible amount of talent still left in their tank? Why does Walken and Pacino arrive in one scene, give a horribly written personal monologue which no one has any right to care about, then disappear from the film never to be heard from again? Speaking of horrible monologues...did I mention they are horrible? I seriously simply lost interest five words into them, they are that poorly conceived and executed.\n\nI need a separate paragraph for this one: the music in here is so abysmally composed one must listen to it to gain it's full impact. If you're willing to sacrifice your hearing you must give it a listen. It is in essence one poorly-composed piece of music that plays during \"emotional and sensitive\" moments that sounds like it loops every five seconds. It haunts this film and just when you think you are rid of it...it arrives to assault your precious eardrums.\n\nYou know, I think this is the best, (or worst?) decade for bad films...taking a look at the last 3-4 years of Razzies and you can see why those guys are going to have a field day for the next six years or so.\n\n1.0/10"

(That's why that, as of mid-August 2003, this movie was #1 on the IMDb.com bottom 100 list.)\n\n\"Gigli\" gives Jennifer Lopez more incentive to focus mainly on her singing career. Sure, \"Maid in Manhattan\" had success, but this Jennifer Lopez movie did not, and J.Lo could be to blame. Diversity is clearly not one of her strong suits.\n\nBen Affleck was the headliner of this movie. He has talent, sure, but he really should stick to drama (i.e. \"The Sum of All Fears\"). The comedy in this movie, as bleak as it is, is only impaired by Affleck's poor delivery.\n\nThe plot of this movie, as well as most of the writing, was unoriginal and uninspired, proving once and again that this movie was just crying out for the bad reviews it received."

As the film progressed, I was bordering on nausea and sleep (sometimes both, go figure). I mean, what happened here?

Ben Affleck was in and out of character so often he made JLo look talented. I suspect bad direction was responsible for her portrayal of a female wiseguy who never delivers. I didn't believe for one minute that she was capable of crushing the life out of someone. The story gave her nothing to work with. By far the worst performance I've seen from her. I thought Justin Bartha was brilliant as Brian, the mentally challenged victim of this farce. A performance reminiscent of Rainman, but not nearly as refined nor inspired as Dustin Hoffman, still a bright spot in an otherwise dismal film. I will admit that I saw this movie to see what was up with Benifer. I think this film will make them yesterday's news. I know I don't care anymore."

After watching it on DVD, I have to wonder if critics and others just teed off on this film because of who the stars were. If you took the same plot with two different actors, I don't think you would have seen such an outcry of hate.\n\nThe biggest problem is that Gigli is supposed to be a Bad Ass Tough Guy hitman, but we never see that from him. Even in the opening scene he is jokingly collecting from the laundromat guy. This makes it hard to buy into the fact that being around Brian has somehow caused a change in him. The same goes for Ricki/Rochelle. She is brought in we are told to be just as bad as Gigli, but again we never see it. It becomes more of a Chasing Amy plot with Brian playing the Banky role and the Bennifer duo playing hitmen instead of artists.\n\nBen and Jennifer play their parts well, but Justin Bartha outshines them both in the role of Brian. The story has holes, but it also has a great guest appearance from Christopher Walken. Overall and average film that probably only got made because the leads are on the covers of the grocery aisle rags every week.\n\nWorth a rental, but I wouldn't buy it....."

I think people had two fundamental problems with the movie: it wasn't an action movie (and everyone's on an action sugar-high after a dozen or so summer action films) and the female lead was a lesbian. If this movie had been released in the fall or spring, and not hyped as a summer B.Af-J.Lo blockbuster, it probably would have been more favourably received.\n\nThe movie has interesting--often clever--dialogue, an interesting turn-around in sexual dominance and an unexpected ending that put a smile on my face. No cars were smashed, the death-count only reached one and the characters just sat around and talked. So what? For the most part what they talked about was intriguing.\n\nIt's a shame, but bad things sometimes happen to perfectly good movies. Rent it when it comes out on video."

Sitting through it was like being shipwrecked on a desert island with nothing to eat but expired tins of Spam.\n\nTo be fair, Jennifer Lopez' speech about the superiority of her private parts (versus the male \"sea slug\" and/or \"big toe\" or whatever she calls it), delivered while she writhes face-up on the floor performing some sort of yoga tactic, was nearly watchable. And the guy who plays the mentally challenged dude steals every scene he's in. These are just minor points, though. We're also forced to sit through mind-bogglingly heavy-handed scenes, such as the one where J-Lo's psycho lesbian ex-lover shows up out of the blue and slits her wrists in a fit of deranged hysteria, and the one where Al Pacino (whose idea of acting these days seems to involve yelling his lines louder and louder to convey depth) shows up to rant and rave incoherently until J-Lo's equally meaningless soliloquy renders him - believe it or not - slack-jawed and speechless. By the end of the movie, I felt the same way."

The acting is wooden - the dialogue might well have been written by a monosylabic ten year old- and the love scenes were apathetic at best.

What I don't understand: why didn't the director have the guts to stop production and send the script back for a rewrite. The biggest problem this movie had was dialogue, or rather, the absence of a writer who knew how to write dialogue. It was obvious that Affleck could barely get his lines out with a straight face. The other major problem was editing. Numerous and seemingly endless scenes of music and no dialogue; while an improvement over the dialogue, did nothing to further the movie's plot, rather, they simply prolonged and slowed the pace of the movie, when just the opposite was necessary.\n\nAn hour into the movie I found myself looking at my watch, shocked to find that it had only been an hour. The performances were fair, hardly worth mentioning. Justin Bartha, who played the kidnap victim, gave the strongest performance and one has to wonder why the movie wasn't named for him, as that might have actually made sense.\n\nThe cameos ranged from the bizarre and unexplained appearance of Christopher Walken as a police officer, to the humorous, but over-done flirtatious mother, played by Lainie Kazan, to the over the top and scene stealing cameo of Al Pacino as a violent and conscienceless crime boss.\n\nI'm not sure that this movie could have been made much better, other than not having been made at all, but it certainly won't inspire future collaborations between the current it couple, Affleck and Lopez. Affleck's performance was rigid and stunted, while Lopez was charming, but ultimately about as deep as the rest of the plot.\n\nOver all, this movie was painful. Slow, boring, and funny when it didn't intend to be, if only because the dialogue was so bad. Wait for it on cable. Don't even bother with video."

The ludicrousness of things such as J-Lo's Tai Moi Chai to erase the memory after you liquefy an eye, made me think what would be next??? Tae Toe Cheese Do...the use of toe cheese to render your opponent helpless?? My biggest debate is which was more disturbing, seeing Affleck give a shot in Laine Kazan's rear or the insipid use of the F word...neither one was used effectively and both were overused (of course, any use of Laine Kazan's rump is an overuse).

Its certainly not the best flick ever (no Chasing Amy) but it isn't the worst either. Sure, the writing seems half-assed but I didn't think that Jen and Ben performed poorly. I DO think that the \"Gobble, gobble\" line was the absolute worst line in the history of movies and I laughed but not because it was funny; I laughed because someone thought that that line WOULD have been funny and unfortunately, it was just tragic. Nevertheless, I tell anyone who will listen that I have seen the movie and even OWN the DVD and (after they stop giggling), I offer it up for them to watch so that they can come to their own conclusion, which I'm guessing many people have NOT done. Since then, I don't know of anyone who has passed out from boredom or died from it being a crappy flick. Most people admit that, again, it wasn't the worst movie they'd ever seen (Hello?

Not in the slightest. The writing and the direction were both truely catastrophically bad. So isn't it weird that the director of this work of cinematic atrocity. There were several times I laughed during this movie, unfortunatly it was because I was wondering if it could get any worse, and than cracking up because some how it managed to get more unbearable with every passing moment. Its never smart to title your movie a word that no one knows how to pronounce, but luckily Ben Affleck clears that up in the beggining of the movie. He says his name is pronounced Jee-lee, you know rhymes with Really. But did any one notice that that doesn't rhyme? Certainly not the brain dead director/writer. I only went to see this cause I am a huge Ben affleck fan, and I'm hoping this film doesn't destory his career because mother of god it was that awful. The jokes were filthy renditions of the same lines over and over again. J.Lo - Laugh at me cause I say dirty words like pussy and cock. Ben affleck - be scared of me cause I say f*ck a lot. Kidnapped Retard - laugh at me cause I'm mentally challenged. I felt awful that the only times the audience laughed was when the mentally challenged character began to rap, yeah its funny, but look at what you have to resort to for laughter, go back to screenwriting 101 before you make another picture. Oh wait for all our sakes just never make another one. Oh and my favorite part was when Gigli (Affleck) was driving in a car and confesses his love to a lesbian which leads to their first kiss and eventually them falling for each other. Wow now I actually liked that part. But wait I liked it more the first time I saw it, in chasing amy, but this director couldn't pull off anywhere near the brilliance of Kevin Smiths writing of that scene. But I'm starting to think a room of full of chimps could have written a better movie than this fool. This is one time where you should belive the terrible reviews you hear, this movie was almost the worst movie ever, only because somehow a movie called from Justin to Kelly came out earlier this year."

Some critics have even said it is the worst film ever made. My question to them is... how many movies have you actually seen?\n\nThis is not to say it is a good film. The plot is worthless and is only there to bring Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez together for an entire film. An appearance by Al Pacino is the film's best moment. And Ben and J. Lo are hardly adept \"contractors\". But this is not a bad movie, and certainly not one of the worst movies ever made. The dialogue actually has a bit of charm to it--even the \"It's turkey time. Gobble, gobble.\" Perhaps because the audacity to even try a piece of dialogue like that made me laugh. But in that scene, J. Lo is not seducing Ben, more like she is offering him a challenge.\n\nSome scenes hurt like hell to watch. Some scenes are just plain boring. But every so often, a scene comes out of nowhere and surprises you with its wit and inspiration. Take a scene where J. Lo argues the superiority of the vagina to the penis as a sexual device. It's quite possibly one of the most hilarious, yet erotic monologues I've ever heard. And I don't even think J. Lo is all that sexy!\n\nI don't feel like spending a lot of time talking about this movie--it really isn't very good. But I do recommend it, simply to counter all the negativity around it. While I never once believed either of the actors to be contract hitmen (or whatever they are), there is a definite zaniness and originality to the film.

        "review_detailed_main": "Now, that's a loaded sentence, if I've ever written one. Ben Affleck's and Jennifer Lopez's relationship is probably the most asinine and nauseating one discussed by supermarket tabloids since Carmen Electra and Dennis Rodman, and yet their romantic relationship in this prescribed failure of a romantic comedy is the most successful part of the whole movie. Keep in mind that you can take that a couple of ways. It could mean that it was done so well that it overshadows the rest of the movie, or it could mean that the rest of the movie is so bad that even the boring romance between these two people was better than everything else. That's all in the eye of the beholder, I guess, but for myself, I have to say that the necessity to watch the entire movie from beginning to end in order for it to be analyzed fairly is unfortunate. If you don't love hearing endlessly about Ben and J-Lo, you may very well have a hard time sitting through this one.\n\nFor some reason that I don't pretend to understand, Ben and J-Lo each play hardened gangsters in Gigli (named after Affleck's character, who in turn is named such for no apparent reason), with Gigli a slightly younger and cockier thug while Ricki (Lopez) is sent along to keep an eye on him. You see, he's been assigned to the kidnapping of the mentally deficient younger brother of a federal prosecutor in the interest of preventing a deserved conviction. This part of the story I won't go into much, since it plays no role in the movie except to have a wispy string of plot along which to string lots of cute scenes with Ben, Jennifer, and, as Gigli charmingly calls him, `the retard.' The criminal plot in this movie is completely meaningless, it bobs it's ugly head above the surface briefly every 20 minutes or so just to remind you that it's there, and then disappears so Ben and Jennifer and argue over the superiorities of their respective genitalia.\n\nThe reason that I say that the romance is the best part of the movie is because this is a film that follows every standard clich\u00e9 which should lead up to the typical odd-couple forced together by their work, so completely different that they can hardly stand each other, only to grow on and toward each other and ultimately reach some sweet, happy middle ground so they can kiss at the end with the sunset in the background while the orchestra picks up. But the reason that they have an extensive discussion of their genitals is because of Gigli's desperation to prove to Ricki, who makes it clear to him that she's a lesbian (and eventually, the audience learns that it's true, she's not pretending just because his first advance on her was so jaw-droppingly idiotic) that she has been missing out on the sheer wonders of the penis.\n\nThis is a remarkably cleverly written scene, but whether you are male or female, gay or straight, you have to admit that it's hard to look past the fact (and I use the word fact purposely) that this is a scene with no other purpose but to have J-Lo gyrate and twist her body for the benefit of the passing camera, ending it with two words and a position that will have everyone in the room sweating. Now, I can hardly complain about this scene, except when you remember that these people are gangsters who have the kidnapped mentally retarded brother of a top federal prosecutor just in the other room (conveniently leaving them alone whenever the script doesn't need him around). The ability of the characters to forget what they're doing for extended periods of time is remarkable.\n\nSo like I mentioned earlier, the crime portion of this movie is completely pointless except for three things - lots of cute scenes with the three main characters (I should say the one main character, played by Justin Bartha, and the two supporting characters, Ben and Jen), the cameo from Christopher Walken, and the cameo from Al Pacino, both of which are so good that they diminish the rest of the film beneath the weight of their presence. Not that there's much to diminish. You can tell how much thought was put into the film by such things as the fact that Affleck's character has a weird name literally for absolutely no other reason than to provide him a couple of opportunities to explain how to pronounce it (`It rhymes with `really...'). Kind of like how that idiot show on MTV Sorority Life derived much of its conflict (at least in the first episode, I could stand no more after that one) from the very fact that it was being filmed, Gigli is evidently named just so that the pronunciation will have to be explained.\n\nIn glancing over the page on the IMDb for Gigli, I've noticed that it has earned itself a place near the top of the bottom 100 films of all time list. Not surprising, although I would not have expected that, even though I knew the film was a critical and popular disaster. Personally, I rated it a 6 out of 10, because while the film failed in everything it set out to do, it had some (2) wonderful cameos from some (2) wonderful actors, and there were also some genuinely amusing scenes involving Brian, the mentally retarded subject of the botched abduction. One scene, for example, featured Brian singing a song by Sir-Mix-A-Lot, which need not be named, since that guy only recorded one song, didn't he? Anyway, this scene is NOT one of the amusing ones. Not in the slightest. Who it was that came up with this little brainstorm and thought it might be funny I can not IMAGINE, but some of the other scenes were definitely amusing. See the scene at the end (unfortunately, you have to make it that far), where he first hears the voice of the girl he's about to dance with. The look on his face is priceless.\n\nI firmly believe that it's important to watch the really bad movies in order to truly appreciate the really good ones, and it's no secret that Gigli is definitely one of the bad ones. But there are different kinds of bad ones, there are bad movies like old horror films that have inadvertently transformed into comedies (many of these are sequels to relatively successful films, like Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street), there are movies that are made by immature idiots that take bad taste to unimaginably abysmal depths (such as the Scary Movies - this is the worst type of bad movie, by the way), and there are bad movies like the kind that you want to watch just because they are so famously awful that it's entertaining in itself to watch them just to see how bad they are. These are almost like feature-length sequences of outtakes. Battlefield Earth is, of course, at the top of this list, but also included are such crapfests as From Justin to Kelly and, of course, Gigli.\n\nThat being said, I can't say that I would totally deter you from watching Gigli. It's entertaining, but before you watch it, keep in mind that it's exactly like David Spade - the only entertaining things about it are its weaknesses."

I gave up counting at 61 about a half-hour or so into the feature. The profanity was used so often, it lost all value as a word. I felt the script was full of these verbal packing peanuts... ...and then came Turkey Time. I was horrified. The 10 or so people in the audience groaned... wow...

My reason for the 10 rating was to make up for the very low and unworthy ratings which have been posted. Alright... now to the REAL review.\n\nThe first disappointing aspect of the film was its very poor casting. Sure Christopher Walken and Al Pacino excellent thesbians, but being like Louis (Lenny Ventino) seem to have no place in the film, especially as an intimidating (maybe sleazy) gangster. Aside from that is the obvious, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck as contract 'thugs', er... very ...bizarre.\n\nOn to the films high points. 'Jen and Ben' carry together an undeniable form of chemistry, and watching the two of them (no matter how sick we are of hearing about their beautiful relationship) brings a good feeling to everyone. The film has many humorous aspects, and Justin Bartha plays the lovable, mentally-challenged Brian.\n\nIn summation, this film is not oscar worthy and won't keep the water cooler busy with philosophical banter, but it is enjoyable and makes us smile...\n\nisn't that what movies were intended to be."

There is resolution at the end, although rather abrupt, cliche, and really gross (why would the master need a 6 year old wife?), but Gigli has none of these things. Manos was made almost 40 years ago on a bet by a fertilizer salesmen. Manos had an excuse. This, as Al Pacino tells us in his normal Al Pacino acting bravado during Gigli, is the twenty f*cking first century. There is no excuse for this kind of crap to be passed off as a major hollywood movie. Maybe at the Summer Indie Rainbow Film festival with the German film featuring a boy running through the forest and multiple shots of a bucket of water that symbolizes somehow that we need to throw out our computers and be one with nature, but not as a major Hollywood release. Watching this movie is like being tied to a truck with your hands duct taped behind your back while the driver speeds through a gravel parking lot."

Ben Affleck is totally wrong for his role, unless he is trying to portray a slimeball so disgusting that the audience feels soiled. J-Lo does have a few passable moments but is certainly at her worst. Appearances by Al Pacino and Christopher Walken don't save it at all. The plot really isn't worth talking about, save to say that it may have been a Woody Allen reject from which any and all comedy was sucked out. One scene does deserve mention: the scene in which a character (J-Lo's character's ex) slits her wrists. Viewers should not get any ideas from this on how to make it stop. Use the remote control and eject the cassette or DVD!\n\nIt makes me wonder how this movie is as low as it is on IMDb's Bottom 100 behind movies like Glitter, which at least has an excuse that some of the principals were not actors."

Let's face it: if one does not motivate himself to see what's not on the \"radar screeen\" and accept what the media offers in it's place, you have a pitiful situation. The majority fall into this. However, if one does have the ability to see through the media's machinations and is determined to find true quality (be it in the great classics or in contemporary obscure cinema) one can only benefit himself and broaden his taste.\n\nToday's movie industry constantly churns out inferior products to an unsuspecting public. Today's Hollywood is a far cry from the superior directing and quality films that were made over fifty years ago. The public is too lazy to have any insight in this. The remedy to the problem of inferior acting, inferior directing and inferior plots is to boycott the cinemas.

Not even him, Christopher Walken, or Al Pacino could save this movie from failing.\n\nAt one point, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez as a couple was a big thing for tabloids & the media but here, they have zero chemistry in this movie, which isn't good for a romantic comedy. It's barely acted and it feels as if there wasn't even a script during production. The film revolves around Affleck as a gangster who has to kidnap a mentally challenged man (played by Justin Bartha), then J-Lo helps him out and the catch is that she's a lesbian. Imagine Kevin Smith's decent movie \"Chasing Amy\" minus the enjoyment, while adding a crime plot and pretentiousness and you have \"Gigli\".\n\nApparently, this flop of a movie costs around $75.5 million dollars. Where did all the money go? How can anyone green-light this? I went into the movie with an open mind and five minutes into it, I knew it was only going to get worse and worse. I take full responsibility for seeing it out of my own curiosity, so you don't have to sit through this painful 2 hour garbage. If you like Ben Affleck, go watch \"Good Will Hunting\" instead of \"Gigli\" and you'll thank me later!"

Sometimes I feel silence while I was watching this movie.\n\nI think Martin is trying to make a movie like Pulp Fiction, which genre is crime and comedy. But come on, it's so far from heaven.

GIGLI is hugely underhyped due to various reasons produced by social media - Lopez and Affleck being a split-up-couple, not very good chemistry between them etc. The bottom line is that this movie is quite OK, far form anything special, but not worth the incredibly low score given in IMDb. It has good supporting cast, occasional nice plot-twists etc. Nothing too cheesy or stupid or any other usual stuff that make movie 1 point smth material.\n\nI'd give it 5,5 points, but due to the IMDb's uncomfortable voting system i give it benefit of the doubt - 6 points."

The thing is, \"Gigli\" is really such a special brand of awful, though. It has some amusing parts, namely the first scene and Gigli's first treatments of the mentally retarded kidnappee (calling him \"stupid\" and \"retard\" might not be very PC, but it certainly does add to his character). But then you have scenes such as the one in which Gigli expounds on being \"a gangster's gangster.\" J. Lo doesn't buy it, and neither do we. The chemistry is severely lacking, the sex scene bizarre, two hours was ridiculously long, the story very muddled and basically pointless, even Walken and Pacino can't spice this schlock up! However, the most heinous of film crimes committed in this movie is John Powell's choice of music. If the score that the movies opens to doesn't warn you enough, you obviously aren't paying attention. The musical choices are made to ellicit certain emotions, but the happy, jivey music present in various scenes is horrific, the \"hey, we just found Jesus\" type found in such scenes as the \"Baywatch = sex\" scene, and the sweet and melancholy chords also played throughout is what makes the movie truly nonsensical and thus truly bad. A score is one of the key ingredients to any film, and this one absolutely fails, making this movie barely watchable, even for a good laugh's sake."

But point people to something and tell them it's \"Baddddd\" and they'll move right along, \"Baddddd!\" (<--- Imagine sheep noise for full effect.) \"Yay! Something we get to pick on! Yay! Something we get to throw stones at!\"\n\nCase in point ... _Gigli_. I watched it recently, waiting for it to suck. \"It's supposed to suck,\" I said. \"When't it going to start sucking?\" Now, I'm not saying it's _Citizen Kane_ or anything, but it's far, far from being the laughable Crap Fest that everyone says it was. It seemed like a decent Romantic ... I don't quite know what genre to put it in. It's not a Romantic Comedy because it's not trying to be funny. It's kind of a softer _Out of Sight_ or a _Get Shorty_ with a more even pace that's not trying to be a hip satire. Maybe it's just me. Maybe I have no taste. But more likely people wanted to jump on the \"Dump on the Hollywood Couple That Everyone Loved to Hate\" Bandwagon.\n\nLook, _Gigli's_ not fabulous, but it's not bad. Get over yourselves. Oh, and to the guy who thought the yoga scene was overlong ... you may be right. So to save you more torture, the next time Jennifer Lopez chooses to do contortions in skin tight workout clothes while languidly discussing the wonders of the vagina, give me your ticket. Straight up, I will sit in for you. No, no. Don't thank me. It's the least I can do."

Let me start this off first by saying that i usually don't enjoy films of this nature and I think with each film Jenifer Lopez becomes a better actress. I would also like to go on record as saying that my expectations were not very high and I really detest Ben Affleck. But in respect for the public I've gotta call'em like I see'em and Gigli is a keeper. The movies is completely original and although it falls into some cliches you can never tell one scene from the next. There's perfect continuinty and adequate and sexy chemistry from the two leads. Jenifer Lopez stars as Ricky an unattainable lesbian contract killer and Ben affleck whose actually pretty good stars as a contract killer. They join for a job where they have to kidnap and hold the mentally retarted brother of an important official. At this point your probably scratching your head saying whatever. But the film actually unwraps quite well. It's a lot of fun to see the sexual dialogue from the two charachters run up against eachother as they fight theie undeniable attraction. And the film although quite bleak and dark remains upbeat and heartful. I'm not saying Gigli is the best film of the year or even on the top ten. But cut the shit people and forget about the stars and give a truly entertaining and playful film a chance."

Granted, the last couple movies each has been in have been poorly acted and lacking anything remotely related to a decent story.\n\nThis, film, however, doesn't require either to completely carry it.

I was surprised that the movie is just amazing and funny with a really great acting from Ben and J Lo , so I loved it. I didn't understand why it received such negative critics , then I started to understand the reason. The reason is yhat many stupid people found the film offensive to the gays and lesbians. Not because it's boring, not because it's ridiculous. Only because it can be offensive to the LGBT community. That's a very ridiculous , absurd and stupid reason to hate a movie. So grow the hell up and watch the movie with an open mind. Just enjoy it."

As for Affleck, this was 10X better than \"Good Will Hunting.\" Throw in some cameos from Academy Award winners Al Pacino and Christopher Walken, hey, you have what we call in the industry, an epic movie. Although the story deals with hitmen and hitwomen (excuse me, Jennifer), there is also a real human element here. The film can be funny in one instant and then, one of the saddest movies you have ever seen. I think that is what makes for good drama, to be able to balance so many emotions and still tell an important story. I will be honest, I laughed quite a bit during this movie, but I cried more. I cried like a baby, because the chemistry of Ben and J-Lo was that damn good. I know it is early to start talking Academy, but it must be addressed. I really have to admonish the studio for releasing this film now, it should have had a winter or Spring release, so as to be fresh on the mind of Oscar. However, I don't think Oscar will soon forget this magical motion picture. Do yourself a favor and see it, do yourself a bigger favor and see it again. Citizen Kane, you now have a rival!"

It was a bit slow but not all romcoms are fast paced. I thought it was a very enjoyable Sunday afternoon flick. The characters developed as the movie went on and went from unlikable to likable. I wish Walken had a bigger role so that was a mystery. Pacino was great. The actor who played the abducted brother (name escapes me) was amazing. Afleck was good as usual. Jlo was sexy and charming. A bit unbelievable as a lesbian gangster but hey, it's Hollywood. She always plays a great lead romantic interest even though in this film she was a sometines flirtatious lesbian. There was comedy and heartfelt drama. I would watch it again."

The movie as a whole is uneven but more entertaining than most movies in the unholy cinema year of 2003.

In fact, I would give it a higher rating, except that I wasn't expecting a couple violent scenes, which almost ruined it for me. But then, it was redeemed in the end by a certain scene on the beach with the autistic boy, which proves that God works in mysterious ways! I immediately had the feeling upon seeing that, but whoever wrote it was divinely inspired, whether they realized it or not. Because things like that do happen in life. They are called Godwinks.\n\nAnd, just like Jennifer Lopez in the movies says, guys usually don't do it for me, but Ben Affleck in this film somehow manages to be an exception. What a pretty boy! He reminds me a lot of Joan Jett's brother. I watched this movie for Jennifer lopez, and I ended up especially enamored with Ben Affleck! Go figure! That being said, Jennifer Lopez was quite a looker herself in this film. I was quite fond of her updos in this film as well.\n\nThe only cons that I really can think of about this movie is that it's an r-rated rom-com, and I'm not fond of any romantic comedy that is r-rated. Although, this, along with Jennifer Lopez's other r-rated romantic comedy, shotgun wedding, is very good. But they would be much better if they were PG or PG-13 at the most. That being said, this movie isn't nearly as bad as people say it is, and I rather enjoyed it.\n\nThe kidnapped brother was annoying to me until about a quarter of the way through, and then he started to be more endearing. By that point, I started to enjoy the movie itself overall."

This movie is the best gangster movie since the Godfather, and honestly this movie is even better than the Godfather Pt. 1 through 3. This movie blows Scarface, Goodfellas, and yes, anything Scorsese has ever done. This is a true cinematic masterpiece! Pacino and Afflack shine. Pacino's second best role, next to Godfather III! If you want to live the high life, watch Gigli! You'll appreciate so much in life, and hell, you might even want to date a Puerto Rican lesbian with a butt the size of Africa! Ben Afflack is in attack mode again, this time not as Daredevil (his second best movie to this). If you enjoy those flick, also check out Get Rich or Die Trying and you might want to see Spartan starring Val Kilmer for a similar ride in cinematic excellence. The ending to this movie is truly orgasmic, and is exciting along the lines to The Road Warrior or even Scarface. Watch out for a cameo from Adam Sandler and Mike Myers too!"

I know that the Swedish DVD I own has it listed as a action-comedy with J Lo and Ben both carrying guns on the cover\n\nThis is NOT a action-movie, it's a feel-good drama-comedy really, and a darn good one too if you ask me\n\nPositives:\n\n-Entertaining performances from J Lo and Ben -Funny dialog for the morepart -Nice well-played dramatic moments as well -Awfully underrated performance from Justin Bartha -Killer soundtrack -Good coming of age story -Jennifer Lopez is more stunning than ever\n\nNegatives:\n\n-Christopher Walkens super-bizarre 2 scene performance where he pronounces words very oddly -The sex talk which there is a lot of can at times admittedly be a little cringe-worthy -Affleck and especially Lopez are a little too nice to be truly believable as tough criminals\n\nBut yeah that's about it overall a very enjoyable movie and laugh at me if you want but I usually cry a teardrop or 2 in the end of the movie"

Most people who have perused my reviews know I judge a film on its integrity and longevity. \"It's turkey time!\" ::Gobble:: ::Gobble:: - An instant catchphrase if I ever heard one; just wait until this enters the mainstream lexicon.

It is a good movie for kids of all ages and also for people that had monkey brain transplants or even had their brain surgeried by monkey doctors. If Gigli was a salad dressing it would probably be sun-dried tomato, or maybe something with a lot of garlic. You know why? Because Gigli packs a little zing, as they say in the business, and also in high doses Gigli can hurt your mouth or give you halitosis. If Gigli was a sandwich, it would be one of those really rare super awesome sandwiches that make all the other sandwiches you normally eat look like second rate amateur sandwiches, or maybe poo sandwiches. Gigli is a spicy treat, aptly seasoned and cooked to perfection as though television's own Emeril Lagassi whipped up one of his signature dishes and then said \"That's a Spicy Meatball!\" Except Gigli is no meatball, it's just one heck of motion picture."

It has some very profound dialogs which only less than one percent of the population can understand. May be that is the reason that people could not like it. It leaves you dangling at the end but why cannot we read love all over flowing in the eyes than being told with explicit scenes. Jennifer is not convincing as lesbian, she is too hot, I admin if this portrayal wrecked the movie unconsciously, may be. If you watch this movie with full disdain for plot then there is nothing wrong with the movie. Just watch with a moving window of ten minutes story and you will feel the power of absurdity with which people have thrown this gem away.

        "review_detailed_main": "I was captivated and eventually rewarded by watching Gigli\n\nIts obvious the lets-jump-on-the-bandwagon effect kicked in and Ben and JLo have always been one of those love-to-hate celebraties!\n\nBut looking beyond this I found an interesting film Yes, its slow, very slow moving to start with and the plot is ethereal but I'm a huge fan of Easy Rider, Waking Life and other films without an obvious plot so I found Gigli captivating from the start\n\nBy the end of the film I was glad to see they had avoided stupid car chases and fight scenes which would have got in the way of the flow\n\nUltimately this is a love story and all other aspects of the story are secondary, sure characters come and go but that doesn't matter, its not the point\n\nThe commentry on male ego and the nature of our society is enlightening and thought provoking. Its an uplifting film at heart\n\nIts also obviously an adventureous movie and it shows, some of the interaction scenes are comical, sometimes there are way too many words used and you start smiling. Reading from a Tabasco sauce bottle was too much! Was this intentional? I'm not sure but I found it funny and you don't often get that with stream of consciousness type movies I don't know how to describe it but there is an aura about Gigli that I ended up enjoying Being an optimist I put down any faults simply to naivity, and this is not necessarily always a bad thing\n\nIt reminded me of Buffalo 66 In this film a convict kidnaps a girl and they end up falling in love\n\nWhat can I say? This film worked for me!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The film Gigli has been critically panned over the last few years and i decided that i should write one of the few positive reviews.\n\nGigli, directed by Martin Brest (Beverly Hills Cop, Scent of a Woman) is a romantic comedy about criminals with a heart. This is a plot that has been done before, a criminal (or two in this case) begins doubting his/her life after being ordered to do a certain job.\n\nNow, that makes it an average gangster film, but this is a romantic comedy. Basically the two criminals (played by Ben Affleck and Jeniffer Lopez) fall in love on a job (babysitting a mentally handicapped young man) this results in a hearty amount of laughs, interesting cameos, tarrantinoesque dialog etc.\n\nThe way i see this movie, a perfectly acceptable (if not above average) romantic comedy. Panned by critics only because of the stars (who wern't that bad at acting).\n\nMy advice, rent this movie, sit back relax, and laugh."

        "review_detailed_main": "***Zillions of SPOILERS***\n\nWatched this about three times last week, and that's not because I lost a bet or am, as Baby Jane Hudson suggested, in a place where 'they can look after me.'\n\nI actually don't like either of the lead actors and was naturally as bored with the coverage of their quasi-relationship as the rest of humanity (that probably included animal life) but that's why televisions come with remotes.\n\nI think this movie took a beating because of the off-screen thing, and that's unfair. Now that some time has passed, maybe that's why its worth defending to a certain degree. I've seen MUCH worse movies, seen two leads have MUCH less chemistry and certainly listened to worse dialogue (although it IS profoundly over-written at times but I'd rather listen to that than having to hear clich\u00e9-ridden, idiot-plex-pleasing garbage).\n\nBen plays Larry Gigli, who works for Nick. Nick kindly requests Larry kidnap Brian, the mentally-challenged brother of a federal prosecutor, in hopes that the prosecutor will no longer do his job on behalf of an associate of Nicks. Unbeknownst to Larry, Nick also assigns Ricky (Lopez) to this particular case so they can keep an eye on each other and on Brian. Larry is insulted that a woman has been put in place to question his authority and professionalism, because he's a self-described 'gangster's gangster' and has the Henry Hill/Chili Palmer wardrobe to prove it. Since Ricky is not leaving, he invited her to share his bed and when he makes a move on her, she rejects him cause she's gay. They then spend a good deal of time pointing out the pluses and minuses of the male and female sex organs and their own preferences, but naturally there's an attraction between them.\n\nShe rejects him with her words but her face indicates otherwise. She also accuses him of being gay, which infuriates him of course.\n\nVarious other people enter the story at different points - Larry's mother, played by a funny Lainie Kazan; Ricky's lover, and Chris Walken, whose five minute cameo serves only to annoy. Then there's Al Pacino, who seems to be re-working Tony Montana by way of Truman Capote.\n\nAffleck is at his best, for me, when he's being emotionally generous and vulnerable. When he expresses his frustration at having a beautiful, unavailable woman in his bed, he expresses it in a very macho way but you know he could shed a tear at any moment. Similar to a scene from \"Chasing Amy\" which happens in a car also. But this time its funny and sad at the same time.\n\nI did learn some things watching this movie. I learned you can remove at thumb from a corpse with a plastic butter knife....? I learned the difference between answering a question with the answer 'yes' or the answer 'sure.' I learned how men are supposed to check if their fingernails need trimming.\n\nIts not all good. But I'm not getting into specifics since as I've pointed out, this movie has already taken too much of an unfair beating already. 8/10."

So my neighbor comes homes one day with a screener copy of the movie as the movie was still playing in the theatre. So I borrowed it not wanting to waste money in the theatre. I started to watch it and was dying half way through the movie, then my neighborhood had a black out so I coudnt finish it that night.. The next day I told my brother how funny it was and that I liked it so much I wanted to finish it off in the theatre. I never actually made it to the theatre but did finish the DVD the next day. I really liked it and found it to be hilarious, however, I can see why someone wouldn't like it. The story doesn't really go anywhere but hey, it entertained me and made me laugh. Also the screener copy I have is different from the actual released DVD you can buy... The screener has a totally different ending... J-Lo isn't really Ricki. She's Rickies roommate, and she isn't a contractor. So all along Ben is listening to her with advice (The cutting off the thumb) and she has never even done anything like this... From what I remember, she just spoke to the boss over the phone and he assumed she was Ricki and she went with it. The official movie has her really being a contractor. Also in the screener, there's a scene where Ben baseball bats some guys car. That was pretty cool. I like the screener better but both versions are hilarious. Not for everyone but certainly for me."

Probably 5 or 6/10. I've watched a few movies lately from this era where viewers expected more than was aimed at them. Take it for what it is and it ain't so bad :P\n\nThe guy with the retard roll was excellent, as good as I am Sam I though. Possibly more of a chick flick but as a guy I thought it was OK but lacking.
