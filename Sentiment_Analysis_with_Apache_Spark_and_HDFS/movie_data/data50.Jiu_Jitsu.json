He is rescued by fishermen and brought to the western military but there is bad translation. He's suffering from amnesia. He is a part of a group of Jiu Jitsu fighters battling an alien creature for 2000 years with the fate of the world in the balance.\n\nThis is a sci-fi B-movie. The story feels like a high school writing assignment. There are a few real actors here. They are of varying qualities. They have Nicolas Cage. It's obvious that most of the expertise lies in the fight choreography. It's Tony Jaa and Frank Grillo and all the stuntmen they can fit. Oh year, they have a Predator slash Halloween costume bad guy and it's an alien. This is bad with good fights that get repetitive. It's bad but not so bad that it's good."

I will give them some credit tho, cause they try to use some different camera styles on the fighting scenes, and well, in some of them the choreography isn't horrible, still, there are so many of them you easily get tired of watching.\n\nTo sum up, a bad bad movie, there isn't much here that's worth giving a shot."

But this, like quite a few of the unfortunate choices of movies you've been in, I have to ask, what were you thinking? I guess money is money? Lol, of course, it's easy for me to be making comments from the sidelines I suppose, so what do I know? But oof! This was so bad! But heck, it was fun to have a few drinks and make fun of this!

Bad everything (acting, dialogue, music, and cartoon cgi). The movie makes zero sense. There are a thousand dumb moments or things to make fun of.\n\nBut i figured, if it has good fighting, i could enjoy it. And i saw tony jaa in the opening credits so i thought we might get that.\n\nWhat do i even say. The fight scenes were TERRIBLE. And it's very odd that it's not because of the usually suspects: quick cuts, shaky cam and close up shots. In most of the fights, none of that was present. And in many, there were extremely long takes with wide shots.\n\nSo why were they so bad? I'm not really sure. One of the best compliments i can say about fight scenes is that i could feel every hit, like with john wick and the accountant. This movie was the exact opposite, i couldn't feel the hits at all. And i don't know why.\n\nMaybe it has to do with sound mixing. There was almost no noise with the hits, and sometimes the noise seemed off by a half second. Could also be that they didn't focus on the moment of the hit. I can't figure it out.\n\nBut what i do know is, the fight scenes gave me zero pleasure. Combine that with every other movie attribute being terrible and this is just a straight-garbage movie. Damn you nick cage!\n\n... i wonder what movie of his i'll watch next (1 viewing, 5/7/2021)"

And we could not stop laughing.\n\nThe main character looks like he's recently been lobotomised and just stares moronically during everyone else's dialogue. Think Jean Claude Van-Damme if you ordered him from Wish. I thought it was a bold move to NOT cast the only recognisable name as the lead, that name being Mr Cage, but it turns out they really just are that stupid.\n\nDon't worry tho because Nicholas Cage delivers with such classic mid-fight quips as: 'That's my favourite chair, I thought you'd find it comfortable' and 'I make hats out of newspapers'...ground breaking. He does have an incredible talent of being left behind at a location by the group of warriors, only to be at the place they're arriving at later. Don't think about that too much, it will never be explained.\n\nThe rest of the cast were just a group of walking stereotypes, which was just perfect! The wise, stoic Asian man who will definitely die 'honourably' at some point. The black man who is afraid of everything and cracks jokes that never land. The female warrior who you better not underestimate, she could break you like a twig sunshine. I mean you really couldn't want more in a bad movie.\n\nI'm sure there is a plot in there somewhere. I think I asked my son about 5 times 'what on earth is happening??' to be met with a reflection of my bemused face. Still now, I cant figure it out... Maybe its because it sets up a vague pretence then doesn't move forward. The 'protagonist' (if you could bring yourself to envision that) has amnesia that for some reason just doesn't improve at any point until the end. There is zero arc...zero.\n\nThe CGI is something to behold. Imagine the quality of late 90's kids TV CGI. It was dreadful. My favourite part was when they revealed the alien's face. I was in tears by that point, a mixture of laughter and desperation.\n\nThis movie has no redeeming features. The acting, the camerawork, the costumes, the dialogue, the plot if there is one, nothing can save this absolute masterclass in how to not make a film.\n\nAnd because of all this, we loved it and have been quoting it ever since.

Regardless of the quality of the movie, one thing is for sure - Nicolas Cage sure is a prodigious film maker. One really has to admire the fact that he just keeps pumping out these straight to video movies as if they were Knight Rider episodes from the 80s. One after that other with clockwork regularity, he puts them out. He REALLY likes making movies. AND he puts his heart into the role, no matter how silly the movie. One HAS to admire that. And despite his advancing years, he's still got the moves. He's fitter than most men his age or even many younger stars.\n\nSo, put aside your criticisms - yes this is a silly movie - it's not to be taken too seriously - A Ninja meets Predator mashup - have fun with it. Nic Cage is doing his best to entertain you and he's far better at it than Steven Segal. And as a bonus Tony Jaa is also in it! I really hope he makes a comeback into mainstream movies - I do have a soft spot for the guy. (Also Tony) Keep at it Nikky!!"

I found it to be a simple story to follow.\n\nMany reviewers criticize the main actor's lack of acting ability, but I think he should be cut some slack as he is known for performing stunts than acting.\n\nSome transitions between scenes seem awkward as they are hard jumps to the story without much detail.\n\nThere was cinematography in one fight scene that was switching between first-person view and third-person view, which confused me a lot on which perspective I'm suppose to look at.\n\nThe comic relief, Tex, seem a little annoying too.\n\nWithout spoiling the film, there was a character whom I thought would have a larger role in the movie that just randomly died in the middle of the movie, and their character death wasn't provided with any emotional weight as if they didn't become relevant anymore & tossed out.\n\nOverall, it's best to watch the film with low expectations."

No - it can't really be spoiled any further.\n\nI enjoy a martial arts flick as much as the next guy - I do Brazillian JJ, and little bits of other, striking, arts to keep my eye in. Admittedly, I suck at all of them, but not as much as this film. I used to think that Nicholas Cage was actually quite a reasonable actor, but just had a propensity to choose poor action parts - this film completely changed my views of Cage, and all the other planks in the cast who were going thru the motions for a pay-cheque. Awful acting, awful plot, awful effects - some reasonably gymnastic martial arts \"tricking\" failed to raise the standard of this dross above awful. It just kind of whimpers out of existence at the end. Too poor to even be comically entertaining."

Even if we never really get to know any of them. Ok so Nic Cage is crazy Nic Cage ... which actually is normal Nic Cage I reckon.\n\nApart from his scenes (he is on a constant red alert mode, energy wise exceptional, no matter how little sense he's making) there is not much in character building from the others. Still this can work on some basic level, if you like watching people kicking the s... out of each other. Add to that an outer space element (literally) and you get ... well you get this movie! Is it enough? Apparently not and I understand that some people are not happy with the CGI and some other things ... you have to overlook a lot of things - but if and when you do, you can have some fun."

The cast is more stuntman/martial artist than actors. It's decently shot (especially Tony Jaa's scenes). I could do with less Zack Snyder slo-Mo but this movie is no more guilty of it than scores of other action flicks.\n\nMartial arts movies are about action. Plot is merely a device to get you to the next fight. Jiujisu is no different. Give your brain a rest and enjoy the action."

I've seen better CGI in 90s video games. Acting and script are beyond bad. But, to me, the worst thing in this movie is that the title is completely misleading: no ju-jutsu at all. Just sub-standard turning kicks and punch scenes. They could have titled the movie kickboxing, karate, or whatever. Don't care. It is junk. Maybe the worst work of Nic Cage (and it is not an easy ranking, the guy tried too hard, but his career is plenty of garbage). This sub-product make Dr. Uwe Boll a genius in comparison, and his movies look like cinematic masterpieces.\n\nI want Uwe Boll back!

Granted, he did do a couple of moves himself, but a fail on effort. Alain Moussi (Jake) and his stupid looking \"blank expression\" when trying to remember stuff degrades his cred further, each time he does it. Marie Avgeropoulos (Myra) wasn't convincing as an intelligence officer and I thought that she would have been more involved. Thankfully, there were no romantic scenes involving Cage, that would have lost another 2 stars. Eddie Steeples (Tex) was obviously cast as comic relief, but wasn't given the air time to do so. Rick Yune (Captain Sand) wasn't used enough either, even Frank Grillo (Harrigan) felt underused. The cast was there, the story felt unfinished, although complete, and there's some cringe too. I would recommend with a couple of warnings."

I think the worst movie ive ever watched.\n\nThis movie is a nonsense fest, heres why.\n\nIf the movie was released in 2000 or less i would say okay its fine, but the probleme is that its a 2020 movie... So why the cgi looks like a 10$ budget fan fiction youtuber video?\n\nAlso during this movie i couldnt stop myself thinking why. Why this? Why that? I truly think the story has been writen by a 8 years old kid. Worst dialogues than madame web. You actually understand nothing on what happen, nonsense cut to the worst choices making. Also why the alien loves fighting humain from million of light years between galaxy? Theres no point to alien to come every 6 years to fight and coming back again and again, like i said earlier the story has been writen by a 8 years old kid dont forget that.\n\nI love slowmo but they should've called this movie Jiu Jitsu Slowmo, i swear theres slowmo in every fight every 5 seconds, at a point where it become laughable. The fights overall were pretty terrible, there was good idea in the choreography, but with no close plan, no rapid cut, bad music, bad acting, poor audio design, bad cgi and punch hit that doesnt even hit its terrible.\n\nI laugh hard tho, if you wanna laugh watching bad movie this one is good."

I don't want to see him mentor the main character for what felt like less than five minutes, if he is going to be a mentor, make him mentor the main character for the majority of the movie.\n\nAs for the rest of the movie, it is nothing special, it is about a prophecy/event that takes place every now and then where many fighters mostly the chosen one/main character needs to stop a great evil from space. That is it.\n\nIf Nicolas Cage was to be the one to stop this great evil, I would recommend watching it, but as it stands with lack of Cage, do not watch at all. It is bad. Trash.

        "review_detailed_main": "Today, \"Jiu Jitsu\" appeared on IMDB's ignoble Bottom 100 List. Oddly, only a few hours later, it was gone. It did land towards the end of the list and I assume some other bad movie got a few negative votes during that time...pushing \"Jiu Jitsu\" back off the list. Still, I have been trying to see as many of the Bottom 100 as possible, so I decided to see it...especially since didn't cost anything to see it!\n\nThe story finds some martial arts expert with a loss of memory, which is bad as he's needed to lead an attack on some alien baddies. And, this ultimate battle seems to happen every six years...and I have no idea why. Wouldn't once be enough?! As you'd expect, there's a lot of kicking, punching and one-on-one combat where the adversaries somehow forgot they were armed with GUNS. When they do shoot at the guy and his associates, it is with lasers...which are about as effective as the ones used by the Imperial Forces in Star Wars! There also is some point of view fighting...which is neat at first but becomes annoying since it's overused.\n\nWhy do I think the film made (briefly) the Bottom 100? Well, despite the punching and kicking, the martial arts isn't always that good, there isn't a lot of plot, the aliens seem much like those in \"Predator\", and the acting is fair at best. Surprisingly, you see Nick Cage in the movie (eventually) and I cannot blame him for being in this low rated film despite knowing little about jiu juitsu. Why did he do it? Because they paid him $5,000,000 for three days' work!! Heck, I'd make a porno for that much money...though I might have to pay people to see it!\n\nOverall, while I don't think it's that horrible. I've seen at least a thousand really awful films, both from IMDB's Bottom 100 as well as from various other Worst of Lists, and I cannot possibly place this in the bottom 100 of widely released movies. Bottom 1000? Maybe. But it is mindless and unless you are weird like me and WANT to see dreck, I wouldn't bother with this one. But if you do, I wish you well!"

Nothing came together however, and the final product feels like it was two or three different movies stitched together. The story was disjointed and nonsensical, characters had little to no motivation, people just walked aimlessly with no explanation as to where they were going, and dialogue felt like it came from different pages of the script. The Director seemed to have ambitions of changing the game, as there were several bizarre choices with cameras whipping around erratically and there was an out-of-place POV sequence that felt like footage from a Sega CD game. It felt like the filmmakers knew how to do fancy gimmicky stuff, but not the fundamentals.\n\nOverall, I suspect that given some time and a good editor, this movie could be recut into a watchable one, as many individual scenes are pretty cool, but as a whole the movie is an unintelligible mess."

There isn't much to the story, the main character was just running from some random alien shuriken, fell into the sea and hit his head.\n\nHe was picked up by a fisherman whose wife stitched him up and delivered him to the US military base. From there the conversation with translation was meant to tell a narrative story with added jokes. This scene was ok.\n\nAnd after the guy wakes up is when you experience bad acting, terrible dialogues and nonsense procedure. How can you ask someone their identity when they woke up, and immediately interrogate them. While interrogating, you assure them that you are running facial and finger print scan :/ later on you want to give a truth serum.\n\nNothing just doesn't make sense.\n\nThen the fighting, I love martial arts movies. And many who are or were eager to watch this movie are fans of the lead actors, or martial arts movies lovers. And the choreography was not all that good. Miss hit interaction, miss sound effects hit, and one sided camera angles.\n\nI couldn't tell what fighting style Tony Jaa was using, all I see him doing his kicking and hitting, and the annoying thing with the movie was the constant over use of slow motions! We understand that every stunt performed by Tony Jaa and Alan were real, but that doesn't mean you need to add slow motion to every hit thrown!\n\nEven though the camera angles were one sided shot, at least it is way better than majority Hollywood movies, at least with this one sided shots, you can see enemies being hit that looks real.\n\nI don't mind the poor budget, poor production or poor sfx, but some of the sfx were unneeded. Such as the dust hit marks, at the start of the infiltration rescue, Alan was fighting one of the soldiers. And each kicks to the soldier would leave a smoke like effect. At first I thought it was a video game hit effect but it was just a poor dust effect to make it look like Alan was actually hitting the guy, it was an unnecessary effect.\n\nI really cannot say much about the movie as I only watched 32mins of disappointing directing. The mysterious villain that was electrocuting the characters was dumb and over powered, it also felt too much like Predator movie.\n\nThen the doctor and translator sneaking up to Alan when he was electrocuted begs a question why the alien didn't detect them sneaking. Or why those sneakers didn't see anything odd.\n\nThe movie just felt really stupid and I did not like the way it was directed! I do like the first person switch to fighting camera angle, that was cool and was never done before.\n\nSo disappointing that this movie could have been better.\n\nJust a waste of good actors: Alan, Crump, Tony Jaa and Frank!"

As far as fight choreography and fight cinematography are concerned this movie is very low on the totem pole. Bring me an english dub of a terrible '80's or '90's martial arts movie and i would rather watch that over this movie.\n\nThe fight cinematography and choreography are terrible which could be ok if the movie was anything other than a martial arts/action movie. It makes me question whether or not the makers of the movie have even seen action movies. Combine it all with a bad script and you have arguably the worst martial arts film i've seen in the last 10 years."

For instance, Cage needs the right Director and material and God, this is NOT it. That he IS this best thing in this is not saying a lot. I won't even bother to explain the 'Plot' - the Film makers didn't manage it so why should I bother! I didn't realise that even now, second-rate 'B' movies were still being churned out. I'll be honest, if all you want is a load of 3rd rate actors in second rate 'Staged Martial-Art' fights, then this is for you. If you are actually looking for anything more than that, give this a WIDE berth.\n\nThe Film comes across as a thinly disguised 'Martial Arts' rip-off of the 1980's Classic Sci-Fi film 'Predator' - and the effects in this are barely better than that 35 year old Film. The Acting, Direction, Effects and Script are SO POOR, you will think this is a cheap made-for-TV movie - but no, apparently they spent $25million on this, though where it went is as big a mystery as how this was ever made.\n\nHowever, if you are a Film buff that thoroughly enjoys watching movies that are SO badly made that they make you laugh or shake your head in amazement - well, then, this may be worth 100mins of your time - in fighting parlance - KNOCK YOURSELF OUT!"

        "review_detailed_main": "It was one thing to find out that Nicolas Cage was in a movie called Jiu Jitsu, that was enough for me to buy the movie on Amazon Prime. It sounds just bonkers enough to be up my alley. Then I discover that Tony Jaa's also in this movie. I could not wait!!\n\nUnfortunately Cage and Jaa are supporting actors in a movie designed to show what a guy named Alain Moussi can do. I don't know if he's doing Jiujitsu on camera but he does have a pretty awesome flip kick. He's no Scott Adkins but we possibly caught this guy at he beginning of his b-marshal arts action movie career, but what what a way to start.\n\nIi is kind of string (and a little racist) that Jaa is not just staring in the movie. They asked Jaa to toned down his cinematic greatest to a 10 rather than the usual 11 so that they could add a bunch of cool camera angles, special effects and slow-motion to Americanize it. Yet still watching Tony Jaa fight is amazing.\n\nNot much of a story but more like a series of really great action sequences that feel greatly influenced by video games more than marshal arts movies of the past (the filmmaker also seems to enjoy comics as I gathered from the all the comic book art being used to transition form scene to scene). The story has something to do with a group of warriors who must defend the planet from alien invaders but one of the warriors (played by Moussi) forgets who he is endangering the mission. The fact that this invasion happens every six years kind of reminds me of Mortal Kombat, but the game these filmmakers are trying to make seems to be a 1st person open world thing.\n\nThere are other cool people in the cast. Frank Grillo who played Crossbones in Captain America the winter soldier. I just binged watched his show Kingdom which is good. Rick Yune, who is yet another victim of Hollywood's tendency to favor White Boys with marshal arts skills. Check out his film the 5h Commandment for proof of that. The film also stars Marrese Crump, a more handsome version of Billy Banks (the Tae Bo guy) who has faced Tony Jaa in a film with Jaa at 11 (The Protector 2). Watch that movie and tell me Hollywood has not slept on this dude's skills.\n\nDespite its lame story the movie is perfect. it just keeps going with so much kinetic energy that it does not stop long enough for you to complain about how weak the plot is. Worth checking out."

Do we need to continue?' I wouldn't mind quitting, something I actually never do, unless I'm starting to watch a movie, finding out I've seen it before. But he wanted to continue and so did I, but we both agreed it was bad. I can't remember having seen a movie that bad: the story, if there is one, doesn't make sense. Acting was poor. And during the fighting scenes the slomo's got nerving. This was a really wasted 1,5 hours. And even Nicholas Cage wasn't able to save this movie. :-)"

        "review_detailed_main": "The film is a weird combination between Predator and Mortal Combat with amazing fight sequences and the overall production quality way higher than your typical Martial Arts flick. However, it still feels like the crew was working on a tight schedule because most of the acting scenes could have benefitted from a few additional takes. Or maybe the actors just found it difficult to get into their characters when the film script didn't make any sense.\n\nAlain Moussi - an amazing martial arts performer, second only to Scott Adkins among current English speaking 360-jump-spinning-hook-kicks throwing action stars, looks really lost here. I mean it's not just that his character is confused as he cannot remember where he came from, Alain himself looks utterly confused about how did he end up on a film set and what should he be doing there. That's a shame, because he did quite a decent job in Kickboxer series reboot but is completely overshadowed by pretty much all the supporting staff as an actor. And it's not like other performances are Oscar worthy - I mean when current days Nicolas Cage stands out as a superior actor, you know, how terrible others should be. The fact that Alain delivers only like five full sentences throughout the whole film doesn't help to build up his character as well.\n\nTo say that the film lacks a decent plot would be an understatement. 1987 Predator feels like a Shakespearean drama compared to this one. None of the main characters' actions make any sense and the whole story is so similar to Predator and Mortal Combat that it's difficult to consider this as a separate movie and not a kind of cross-sequel-spin-off of both original franchises.\n\nBut disregarding all that, the film provides a decent entertainment due to amazing fight scenes. Quite surprisingly, the best fight scenes are crammed up in the first 30 min of the film but they're so good that they make up for the non-existing plot and pedestrian acting. In terms of fight sequences, this is probably one of the best American-made martial arts films in the last decade. But once again, unless Mr Adkins is pulling off his Boyka magic or John Wick goes on a wild killing spree, there's not much of a competition. To sum up, the film is definitely worth to check for any hard-core Martial Arts film fans but any person looking for a comprehensive story and interesting, believably acted characters might be disappointed."

I don't like Cage, but I think this role suited him. It is all about the action! The action was way too slow, let's face it I could have done some of the moves and I am a fat grandma. Why did they keep stopping in the middle of fights? Why did they waste so much talent to make a boring movie? Also olive trees and Buddhist temples...who'd a thunk?

Jiu Jitsu is certainly worth checking out."

The director of photography shouldn't be legally allowed to own an Instamatic camera. The saving grace of what was palatable is the translator's ineptitude in an early scene.

To elevate the narrative, it's crucial to refine the dialogue, infusing it with a more mature and nuanced tone. Additionally, exploring the backgrounds of the characters could establish a stronger emotional connection with the audience.\n\nThe relationship between the amnesiac hero and the alien could be further developed to create a more compelling dynamic. By steering clear of predictable plot points and clich\u00e9s, the script can maintain a sense of freshness and originality. Consider delving into more complex emotions and avoiding narrative shortcuts, which might give the film a more sophisticated and mature edge.\n\nUltimately, addressing these aspects can transform the film into a more refined and engaging cinematic experience, resonating with a broader audience. A balance between the intriguing premise and a polished execution is key to ensuring the film's success and leaving a lasting impact on viewers."

Four-five trained main actors, with everyone else being porn-star hires (big muscles & breasts). Camera angles shot from mid-far range and stayed there during fight scenes. Story.

With a wasted cast, with unattractive martial choreography, with a villain who is a Predator clone and with supporting actors who contribute nothing (Cage is implausible in his role) we can conclude that it is an impossible film. If it were not for the fact that there was a trial over a tax refund issue in Cyprus we could say that this box office failure could have a second part, which evidently we do not need or want.

Of course the story is not something you watch this kind of movies for but the plot seemed very incoherent. Pretty much the only decent thing in this movie besides Nick was the camera work. I felt that most actors were just saying their lines and only Nicolas was actually acting, without his presence I think the movie would deserve no more than 1 out of 10 stars. If he was given more screen time the movie might have just been worth four stars.\n\nAll in all, the movie is garbage but I am a hardcore Nicolas Cage fan so I couldn't just skip watching it after noticing it on a streaming service."

I had exceedingly high expectations, as anyone who has regularly watched films over the last few decades would.\n\nFor the most part, I would say that Jiu Jitsu does deliver pretty effectively -- it is an absolute joy to watch; I don't think there are too many that are going to deny that!\n\nUnfortunately, & why I give it only a 7/10 -- Jiu Jitsu was just never going to meet my expectations; it is truly an attempt to make the impossible film, I think. At least for Human Beings anyway; I mean, who knows? With all this fantastic work that generative AI has been able to produce in just the last 6 months, maybe someday soon it will be able to merge Nic Cage & Tony Jaa into one Super-Actor & create scenes no one has ever conceived of before that somehow makes the impossible film become possible...(?)"

Let me badxplain it to you... easy with a comparison: take \"A wrinkle in time\", an Oprah vanity project infused with mountains of Disney cash, horrible acting paired with pretentious nonsense script and a \"woke\" director that is in way over her head. Journalists and sites artificially maintaining the vote high because of spineless conformism. THAT is a 3 or 4 out of 10, only because the technical departments did their job. The viewers pay full price and believe the hype and ultimately are the victim.\n\nNow, only now, let's have a look at JIU JITSU, the cash is bare minimum, camera is terrible, sound is barely decent, the acting is either desperate attempt to save face or straight horrible: the production is cutting so many corners that they end up with a sphere, the perfect solid. It's sooooo bad that it goes straight to the other side. This film is a monster, in the latin original sense: monstrum, itself derived from the verb moneo (\"to remind, warn, instruct, or foretell\"), and denotes anything \"strange or singular, contrary to the usual course of nature\". A marvel of nature, you cannot plan for this stuff: is the collective result of C-List actors desperate for cash and an improvised crew, improbable production standards and a weird 3rd rewrite of the script for a grand total of 7 (!) bucks ticket. That would be enough for a 6,5/7 but... it's got (Oscar winner) Nicolas Cage, the myth. It's a straight 8!!! (and if you stiff upper lips fake connoisseurs don't get it, rewatch some of your beloved pretentious crap and stick to that).\n\nPS It's not perfect because nobody died during production as far as we know."

Legendary martial artists like Tony Jaa and Alain Moussi join forces with the impossibly charismatic Nicolas Cage to bring the world of Jiu Jitsu to life, and its a world I hope we can return to in a sequel one day. The story grabs you tight from the first moments and doesn't let go until the very end, whipping you through an intricate world of action adventure excitement. Jiu Jitsu is good old fashioned moviegoing fun, and it will satisfy the wide eyed kid in all of us. Highly recommend."

        "review_detailed_main": "Jiu Jitsu is a really good martial arts action movie I've seen in a long time, and having Nicolas Cage and Frank Grillo is icing on the cake. The film is essentially a knockoff of The Bourne Identity and Predator. The fight scenes are exceptionally well done, and even Cage gets in on some of the fight action. Jiu Jitsu is certainly worth checking out. Entertaining movie with great action sequences that martial arts movie fans will definitely love. Put on some popcorn and enjoy."
