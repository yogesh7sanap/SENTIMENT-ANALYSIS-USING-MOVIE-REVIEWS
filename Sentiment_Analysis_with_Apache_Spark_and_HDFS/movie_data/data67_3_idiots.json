It is more of an inspirational comedy with some serious but good messages. A more accurate title would have been \"The Legend of Rancho\".\n\nOdd to me is that they speak in part English, part Hindi through the movie, kinda like some speak \"Spanglish\" here I suppose. I know none of the actors but the acting was good, and there was plenty of humor. The characters were believable. Most movie dancing I find a little silly but I even liked the dancing routines in the bathroom.\n\nI will be asking my co-workers for more recommendations after this one!"

Serious, sad and silly, often concurrently but overwhelmingly very, very funny and engaging, as engineering students at an Indian college end up teaching as much as they learn. Who could disagree with the distinction between education and learning while recognising the often sizable gulf that exists between the two after watching this. Who would dissuade those with aspiration and passion from pursuing their dreams and goals. Weighing in not too shy of three hours you'll be shocked how quickly the time flies as your attention is vacuumed up and your view of the world turned on its head, or inverted, depending what you've learned."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's hard for me to review this film, as I have not seen a huge number of Indian films--probably no more than a couple dozen. Most of the ones I've seen were wonderfully entertaining but I am far from an expert on Bollywood. Because of this, I have a hard time knowing how good this film is relative to other films from this country. So, consider this when you read this review. This may be among the very best India has to offer or it just seems that way to me.\n\nLike so many Indian films, this is a very, very long film--with a run-time of almost three hours. When a movie is bad or just okay, this can seem like forever, but since \"3 Idiots\" is a very, very good film I loved its length. And, like most films of the genre, it has its share of the usual singing and dancing so foreign to films from other countries. One thing you should know, however, is that defining the type of film it is isn't really easy. Much of it is a comedy, but it also has many poignant moments (keep the Kleenex nearby), some existential moments where they explore the meaning of life and work and it's also a tender film about friendship. And, as my daughter pointed out when she saw the film, she loved that the men in the movie are not afraid to cry--something you rarely see in western films.\n\nAs for the plot, it's very long and involved and I could recount what occurs. But I don't want to spoil a single wonderful moment, so my advice is just sit back and watch--and if you give it a chance, I can almost guarantee you'll have a great time with this poignant and funny film. Wonderful and well worth your time--with a delightful script, wonderful characters and lots of moments that made me smile...and a few that brought me to tears. See this film."

These are the golden rules which 3 IDIOTS teaches you in a very light and entertaining way.. The movie makes you laugh and in the process you learn many golden rules which can alter your life in a big manner...\n\n3 actors from the path-breaking blockbuster RANG DE BASANTI( Aamir, Sharman, Madhvan) team up together with Rajkumar Hirani.. It couldn't get bigger! Loosely based on blockbuster novel ' Five Point Someone ' by Chetan Bhagat the movie deals with the present education system in India that whether getting more marks and better grades is better than gaining knowledge and is mugging up everything more useful than understanding it..\n\nThe movie has many hilarious scenes and everyone in the film form Aamir to Boman Irani to Omi Vaidya were superb in their roles.. Aamir has outdone himself.. Never in the film he has looked 44 year old... Film's music sounds mediocre but when viewed on the screen then the music sounds perfect.. Cinematography is awesome and so is the direction.. Raju Hirani's screenplay(you can easily ignore a few loose points) is a masterpiece and the film will achieve cult status for engineering students in a short period of time.. It has the soul which Five Point Someone had.. It is easily Aamir Khan's finest film to date.. The film's climax is fantabulous and is a shocker.. It takes everyone by surprise...\n\nTo conclude 3 IDIOTS has the potential to break all records and sweep all awards.. Watch it... You will Love it...\n\nMy Rating: 9/10\n\nThanks and Regards"

The story does not need that at all. The story itself was very pleasant to follow. Full of mixed emotions, happy ones and sad ones. The cast and the filming was great. All actors gave a good performance throughout the whole movie. Like in most American television series they want to give you a lesson in life and most of the time it makes me want to barf but in this Bollywood movie it works perfectly well. I had fun watching this and I get why I am not the only one. Certainly worth a watch."

        "review_title": "Scarcely has a comedy provided its audience with so much insight, intelligence, and human affection",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"All is well,\" the three \"idiot\" heroes of 3 Idiots recite when they become frazzled or nervous, while frantically tapping their hearts. They know that reciting the oversimplifying phrase will not provide their problems with a solution, or even a catalyst, but it gives them the onset courage they desperately need at a time of uncertainty and despair. One character even tries to use the line after an amateurishly-given birth may have gone terribly wrong. It's times like that when the saying may not be so effective, even if its goal is not to provide certain relief.\n\nBut all is well, as they so often say. Rajkumar Hirani's 3 Idiots, my introduction to the world of Bollywood cinema, is a comedy-drama unlike any one I've ever seen, long, but never drawn out, frantic, but never desperate, and emotional, but never manipulating. It provides us with three of the most likable characters of the last decade, and with insight to the culture of Indians and their parents. Rarely has a comedy had this big of a brain in its head and a canvas of opportunities in mind, while possessing a title not even fit for a farce.\n\nOur title characters are ambitious but stunted Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan), jittery, fearful Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi), and borderline prodigy Ranchhoddas \"Rancho\" Shamaldas Chhanchad (Aamir Khan), three close friends who attend the Imperial College of Engineering (ICE), one of India's most prestigious colleges where only the best are accepted. The young boys already are facing some of life's greatest challenges, all of them pursuing the field of engineering when the only one who seems to have a passion for the material is Rancho. Farhan was forced to become skilled in the field because of his strict father, and Raju is pursuing the field with the goal of getting his family out of poverty, with his father's expensive health bills, his mother's fragile core, and his sister's inability to marry all on the table. Rancho is studying because he feels that one should pursue passion and make a career out of it, so it doesn't feel like work. If you're passionate and devoted to your work, success will find you - yet this is only one of the countless morals and insights 3 Idiots provide its viewer with.\n\nThe film chronicles their issues in college in flashback, with instances in the presence popping up to show Farhan and Raju searching for their pal Rancho, who has disappeared and avoided contact for several years now. This is not your typical flashback film, however. It uses this method much to its advantage, and doesn't feel like a narrative within a narrative. It seals both stories nicely, but it takes the viewer on a roller-coaster ride of emotions through carefully constructed events before it even arrives at those endings.\n\nOne of their problems in college is the professor/dean of the campus, Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), who the three derogatorily call \"Virus\" when his back is turned. Virus is strict and often largely unsympathetic to the problems of his students, which allows the film to explore a dark topic one assumes a comedy wouldn't dare cross paths with and that is the issue of Indian teen suicide. One kid had his father have a stroke, rendering him unable to focus on academics for months, falling gravely behind. Virus is grossly unsympathetic to his case, denying him an extension on a project he's work so unrealistically hard on but can not perfect.\n\nIf anything, we can say 3 Idiots is a message to the parents of the Indian youth and that is to stop applying pressure to an already stressed out demographic. I've read several articles articulating the point that Indian teenagers are among one of the highest in suicide rates, and that many parents put an unrealistic amount of pressure, duty, and responsibility on the child to the point of a physical and mental collapse. You're given the unalienable freedom to raise your kids with the method you choose, but not every method is perfect, and when your method is one of the ones that leads to suicide, mental health problems, and perpetuates fear and anxiety in the minds of teenagers, then you may want to reevaluate your methods.\n\n3 Idiots also provides us with the idea that many Indian children are told what to become in life early and are discouraged from exploration or even personal ambition. This I can't believe. What an unhappy, uninspiring, completely wasted life to slog through everyday doing something you loathe all because it was the lucky career choice of your parents. Yet I'm sure millions have been lead through this same life. It's the worst way of \"living through a person\" that I can imagine.\n\nThe film runs ten minutes shy of three hours, which for few viewers may seem too long and uncomfortable. I was skeptical myself walking in rather blind. Almost every Bollywood film I've conducted research on seems to run an upwards of three hours, some extending and testing the waters to roughly five hours. If other Bollywood works have characters drawn along the same lines of being relatable, human, and easily accessible and not biased towards race or social class, I can't see it being a struggle to get through any of the industry's films.\n\nThrough every quick-witted song and dance number, through every comedic scene, through every instance of dramatic despair, emotionally alive moment, solemnly poignant sequence, suspenseful setup, to a lovely, heartfelt conclusion, 3 Idiots is a wonderful, invaluable endeavor in the world of film. Its actors are beautifully fitting for their roles, assisted by a script so human and true to life that it is honestly hard to believe, and captured through beautifully alive cinematography to collectively give us a beautiful package not just in the figurative sense. This is arguably one of the best comedies I've ever seen."

I've seen clips of Indian films on cable TV and to be honest...I just don't get it. I don't get all the silly dancing and singing in almost all movies. I find it so corny and irrelevant to the story. But don't get me wrong, Philippine movies back in the 80's were also filled with corny singing and dancing. But we have gone past those and transitioned into movie-making based on good scripts...rather than cheesy story lines.\n\nWhen a friend of mine recommended this movie, I haven't really heard of it. I thought it was a Hollywood release but it wasn't. It was a Bollywood movie. He said it was really funny, so out of curiosity, I got hold of a copy.\n\nMy first thought was that it was nothing but a silly story of 3 guys doing slapstick comedy that I have all seen before. When they started singing \"All iz well..\" I told myself... I knew it! Just what I thought.\n\nBut as the movie progressed...I was amazed at the intelligence embedded in this movie. I was so impressed with the smart dialogues delivered by Amir Khan. It was so mature and thought-provoking. The life crisis all of them were in... the pressures at school..the pressures from society and the pressures from family as well... they rang so true. I was even at one time crying my heart out. I can't believe it! All the preconceived notions about a Bollywood movie were obliterated. I was so moved by this picture and I have no regrets seeing it."

It's a Bollywood buddy-movie devised as an epic and determined to outdo all the competition and being a Bollywood movie is full of large-scale musical numbers as well as a lot of very broad and very funny comedy.\n\nThe 3 idiots of the title meet as engineering students, become life-long friends but are separated by that old fickle finger of fate. It's also bold enough to deal with such issues as suicide and poverty and, of course, the caste system and is lifted onto an altogether higher plain by a terrific performance from Aamir Khan as 'the idiot' the other two worship and who, naturally, isn't an idiot at all but the sharpest tool in the box and he's brilliantly supported by Sharman Joshi as his potentially suicidal friend and Omi Vaidya as his number one rival. Brilliantly directed by Rajkumar Hirani this is the kind of film Hollywood could learn a lot from and which, had it been a Hollywood film, might well have swept the boards come Oscar time."

If you are into movies, then this one is not to be missed unless you are the 4th idiot. I cried, I laughed and I enjoyed every moment of the 3 hours that I spent watching this gem. The songs that seemed mediocre before watching the movie, feel like perfect for the movie. They are so ideal for the situations that I just loved them.\n\nAs you can understand, they could not bring the name of any IIT into the movie to avoid disputes. But trust me, whatever they have shown about the life in IITs, it's all true. Right from suicides, cold-hearted Professors to lack of encouragement and support for talents who can really bring serious change in this world. The movie successfully depicts how once inside, your life is only about meaningless grades, go get into the race before it's too late.\n\nTake my free advice and avoid any reviews or words from people who have already seen the movie. Don't let anyone spoil any scene from the movie. Rush to the nearest theater and experience the phenomenon for yourself. You'll bless me for this advice !"

The movie is terrifically funny and engaging, seamlessly moving from comedy to tragedy to musical numbers.\n\nThe story centers around a brilliant, iconoclastic technical student who spends the movie telling people to follow their dreams. While generally lighthearted, the movie strongly addresses the apparently terrible stresses on Indian college students. But in spite of some dark moments, overall this is about as feel-good as you can get. Feel-good to an absurd degree? Sure. But what's so bad about feeling good?\n\nWhen I think of Bollywood I think of big musical numbers, and there are a handful here, although they're a tiny part of the three-hour running time. Still, they are tremendous fun.\n\nTo sum up, I saw a Bollywood movie, I laughed, I cried, and now I want to see more.\n\nUPDATE: I saw more. So many good movies out there!"

On parallel there is a love angle between Rancho and Pia (Kareena)... Many of the situations/characters have resemblance or inspiration to \"Five Point Someone\", blockbuster novel penned by Chetan Bhagat...\n\nBoth humour and emotional quotients are amalgamated in the right proportion, full credits to Raju for that... Film offers lots of quality rib-tickling moments throughout.. The intermission point offers a twist that is totally out of the blue and keeps you hooked to the movie ! Just when you think this feel-good comic caper is leading to its culmination, there is another surprising element at the climax which is brilliantly weaved out by Hirani...\n\nTechnically, it rocks with astounding and visually arresting cinematography, the aerial shots of Shimla and Ladakh are a pleasant treat for our eyes... Editing was good... Song visualizations were cool... Music was good and well placed with the flow of the narration...\n\nComing to performances, all of them comes out with convincing portrayals, but it is Aamir Khan, the real showman of Bollywood, steals the shows with yet another stellar portrayal and will go down as one of his best performances. His looks and mannerisms as a college student was genuine and consummate.. Madhavan and Sharman adds up with commendable performances... Kareena does her part well... Among the supporting, Boman Irani as the eccentric head of the institution was too good...\n\nOn the downside, there are some unbelievable filmy situations which can be excused as writer's liberty and the episode of Mona's delivery was a bit far stretched.. Still these minor negatives does not affect this wholesome entertainer ! In short the basic theme of the movie is that \"chase excellence and success will follow\".. Just like that Aamir and Raju has chased excellence and success is following them...\n\nSo to sum up, Aamir and Hirani has delivered the best movie of 2009... Do yourself a favour by seeing this highly emotional and feel good comic entertainer...\n\nVerdict : THE BEST of 2009 ! Rating : 9/10\n\nfor more reviews of the latest Indian movies, visit www.snehasallapam.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "Unlike many other Bollywood movies, 3 Idiots was enjoyable - at some points.\n\nFirstly, the film provides a useful message - do what you love rather than what someone else thinks you should do. It also has a clever and quite unpredictable plot which makes the film certainly watchable.\n\nHowever, the reason for this film's downfall is due to its comedic aspect. The jokes and comedy to this film is super immature and childish and wouldn't make 99% of adults laugh. I genuinely believe that if this film had little to no comedic aspects, or at least a less childish comedic aspect, and was a serious film it could be comparable to Good Will Hunting.\n\nHad the potential to be a global success but only succeeded domestically."

After all, Aamir Khan has been producing successive hits over the years. Now for the movie - which starts in an engineering college in India, goes on to show the lives of three of its students through the years till they graduate. This being a Bollywood film, obviously has a smattering of romance and song and dance sequences. Right from the start where Aamir jaywalks into the college building without a care in the world to the time he starts questioning the teaching methods in class, its just a matter of a couple of days. Some cheeky guy this is! Unfortunately, all his antics and funny lines are as old as the college building he is in. You would have heard these jokes a hundred times over. Anyways, that is the best part of the film since it at least elicits a few laughs. The rest of the 3 hours is filled with stereotypes and melodramatic scenes which are ridiculous at best. It seems that these days in India, anyone who can make the audience cry can laugh all the way to the bank. Aamir has this knowledge and isn't afraid to use it."

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw the paid premiere of 3 idiots today.On the whole, 3 idiots is a winner all the way everythingwise.3 idiots suits the term 'landmark cinema' and has all it takes to help Bollywood take a giant step into world cinema with pride.3 idiots is a sparkling example of qualitative cinema.3 idiots not only entertains, it also enlightens.3 idiots is forward-thinking, but also makes you recall your roots. It promises lots of laughs and also a heartwarming message.There are movies aplenty, but very few remain etched in your memory and possess recall value. 3 idiots is one of those films. Indisputably and undeniably, this Aamir-Madhavan-Sharman outing is worth the price of the ticket and more.The film will set new records and has the merits to emerge one of the biggest hits of all times. The weekend business should be historic, the Week 1 business should be unparalleled, the lifetime gross should be amongst the biggest of all times. In short, 3 idiots has 'Blockbuster' written all over it.The story of 3 idiots has been told differently and most importantly, the story offers so many twists-n-turns that you just can't guess what would unfold next.There's so much happening in every scene and the screenplay is so gripping that you don't feel the need to look at the auditorium ceiling or at your watch at brief intervals. You aren't restless. 3 idiots demonstrates how strong film-making can enhance and elevate an already solid concept.An Aamir Khan film is nothing short of an event. The supremely talented actor acts in one film a year and no two films are ever identical in terms of plot line.To sum up, 3 idiots is commercial Hindi cinema at its best. The film has 'Hit' written all over it. Let me put it this way: Cancel whatever you're doing today and go watch 3 idiots instead.Director Rajkumar Hirani strikes a fine balance between humor and emotions. The comic portions are executed with panache, the drama is attention-grabbing and the emotional quotient is strong enough to turn you moist-eyed. The marriage of humor and emotions as also technique and content is what drives 3 idiots to the winning post."

        "review_detailed_main": "We saw a sneak preview of 3 Idiots last night at Globus Cinema in Bandra, Mumbai.\n\nBrilliant. Simply, brilliant.\n\nSimple but articulate story telling laced with lots of humour and lessons from life. A wonderful experience to watch as every single actor from Sharman, Madhavan, Boman, Kareena & Aamir deliver probably the best performance in a movie this year.\n\nSharman & Madhavan start off on a journey to seek out their friend Rancho. Together they were the 3 Idiots in college. And they take us the viewers with them on this beautiful journey with such warmth, panache, humour and love, that we don't want the journey to end.\n\nSharman really shows why he's one actor to watch out for. His acting genes come through in every single scene. He's perfect in his role. Sharman, you rock!\n\nMadhavan as the guy who's chasing his father's dreams rather than his own is wonderful. The character who learns to laugh at life and it's ironies thanks to his friend Rancho. Madhavan shows his humorous side brilliantly savoring every scene and making it a pleasure to watch. His narration of the movie is very good.\n\nBoman Irani is probably the one actor we take most for granted just because he's so brilliant! His characterization of the control-crazy, hyper-active, hyper-competitive, almost dictator-ish, college principal, is beyond words. He plays it so so well, that you love to hate him. He's that Good.\n\nKareena comes through in this movie as one of the finest actresses we have. No one else could have played her part and also looked so beautiful at the same time.\n\nAnd now take it from a hard core Amitabh Bachchan fan, Aamir Khan is the best actor in town today after AB. Period.\n\nHis range is phenomenal and his characterization of 'Rancho' in this movie is positively brilliant. The small mannerisms, the walk, the smile, the attitude, the brilliance of a young person who's not restricted by the educational system, his positive attitude towards every thing in life, it's Rancho you are looking at. Not Aamir.\n\nAamir's ability to transform himself convincingly from the super-huge well-built temporary amnesia patient on a revenge spree in Ghajini to this whacked out college student, which is half the age he played in last movie shows his prowess as a master actor to transcend age barriers to play almost every role in the book.\n\nThis is THE best movie of 2009. Aamir again reigns supreme. Thank you Raju Hirani & Vidhu Vinod Chopra.\n\nClich\u00e9 word, but I have to use it - FANTASTIC !! 10/10\n\nP.S. Don't forget to say 'Aal Izz Well'"

        "review_title": "My most favorite movie.",
        "review_detailed_main": "This particular movie is my most favorite movie of all times. I don't even know where to start with. I have definitely watched over 600 movies in my life, and this happens to be the only movie which was able to have a positive impact in my life. Long story short, I have been in the place of each of Rancho, Fahran and Raju in my life. And I have always applied the principles this movie introduced whenever I have been in a tough situation. I have learned to follow after excellence rather than success. I have learned to follow my passion and care less about what society thinks about my decision.\n\nRajkumar Hirani has always addressed a certain issue and/or has boldly hit many lame principles and ethics of the society with a perfect satire. In this movie, it's about the cliched belief that if you're a science student, then it has to be either medical science or engineering if you want to get successful. In the real world, many people have been a victim of this belief and have wasted their life. Had they not been brainwashed by the society, they would've had a better life. That's what the movie justifies and as per my experience, it makes a whole lot of sense. Another thing is, you need to worry about excellence. If you are excellent, the good grades are almost obvious. And in the end it's your excellence that matters, not the grades.\n\nHirani tells the story in his own unique way. Just like in every single one of his movies so far, he crancks up everything to 11 to make sure that his point has reached to the audiences' mind. Many of those cranck ups do not make sense in real life, but that does not even matter because the movie doesn't want that particular cranck up to be relatable. But it does want whatever that cranck up tries to tell to be relatable. And it succeeds in that. And whether or not it makes sense or not, you'll get the point and a great dose of laughter. And there are some of the sequences which are just hilarious and over the top, and are meant just for the sake of laughter. The characters are very likable and quite different from one another. Each of them are a representative of the kind of people there are in the society and in the academic field.\n\nThe movie doesn't make all kind of sense if you look at it quite literally. Even I would say it's quite nonsensical if I am to look at it literally. But it's meant to be looked at literally. Many scenes are mere representation of something else that the story wants us to know. With that regards, it's pretty good. Even if you watch it at the face value, you won't be bored at all. There will be a build up to something, and the final result will be exactly the opposite of what you expected and that will make you laugh a lot.\n\nThe songs are pretty good. They aren't the strongest part of the movie by a long shot, but are still popular than many recent Bollywood songs. It's strange that a late 2000s movie had songs which are still popular. Every single actor have given their best performance till date.\n\nRating : absolute 10/10, Grade : golden A+"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is the first Bollywood movie I have seen. (I don't know if \"Slum dog millionaire\" is also an Indian movie or not.) I have learned from my parents long ago that Indian movies are excellent and full of dance scenes. They watched quite a few Indian movies when they were youngsters.\n\nThen I had my first experience of watching a Bollywood movie quiet by accident. It was during the sports meet held by the school in which I teach English. I was appointed to do some work using the computer, which we would run some movies when we were free. And the first movie was \"3 Idiots.\" I don't know who picked the movie. To be honest, I never would have picked this one myself because of its stupid Chinese title, which, translated back into English, is \"3 idiots who make scenes in Bollywood\".\n\nI expected to see a movie that was funny from beginning to end and that could be enjoyed without your brain working too hard. It turned out to be way more than that. It's a movie that made me laugh uncontrollably at some points, shed tears at other points and think all the time.\n\nIt's about friendship, dream, love and college education. I think the best part is about college education. The situation depicted in the film is almost the same as in China. As a teacher in a high school in China, I know exactly what problems we have in education. What shows in the movie is exactly what happens in China right now. We attach so much importance to grades that teachers and parents will do anything to improve their study, which causes a lot of students' losing interest in study. I recommend all Chinese educators see this movie. I myself have watched it for at least 6 times, including those times I watched it in my class with my students.\n\nI give it a ten."

Well Hirani's directing totally shifted my views not only on Indian cinema but also helped me understand and appraciate Indian culture. For me it was easy to relate with the struggles of the charecters to face their family's plans for them as well as to survive the rat race that our lives have turned into, in spite of the fact that I have no asian background. Hirani manages to make a serious case by using explicit humor which makes the movie a real masterpiece."

The majority of the film is a flash back of the college days of three young boys, whose future had been decided at birth. Correlating with with the Indian stereotype of: whenever a boy is born he will become an engineer. The moral of the film is that when one finds what they truly love to do, work will become play. This moral is presented to the audience through numerous comedic and emotional situations very well placed throughout the story line. Although much of the story is very predictable, I believe the film was supposed to be this way, as the point of the film was to teach the audience a very important lesson: do what you love to do. As with all Indian films, this one also had the token 'love' part, which no Indian movie seems to be able to function without. This is a recommended watch, whether it is in theaters or on DVD, this movie is a definite 'feel good' film that the whole family will enjoy. It will also be released in its entirety on YouTube after 12 weeks."

It is not a dumb comedy, rather a very smart (and humorous) look at the struggles of engineering students in India.\n\nI thought I would have trouble with the subtitles, but after about 10- minutes I was completely 100% engrossed in the movie. The wife loved every bit of it.\n\nMy single and only criticism is the length of the movie. I believe there were one or two too many situations which kind of caused the movie to drag.\n\nOtherwise I thoroughly loved it.\n\nDo not be fooled by the idiotic picture on the cover of this movie. And the first 5-minutes of the movie are not indicative of the brilliance of the rest of the film. It is not stupid humor (even though I like stupid humor).\n\nYou will leave this movie being glad you watched it. Trust me."

Acting wise Amir khan is best. sharman, r. madhavan , kareena,boman irani did fine job too. Now where i differ others is the whole idea of movie is adaptation of MUNNABHI MBBS on different background. After interval the movie is like munnabhai MBBS part 2. same situations and scenes. when i came out of the hall i felt like director decided the start and end of the movie first, and then wrote the script, created the situations, characters later. This is my opinion of the film, this may hurt others but when i think about it as Rajkumar hirani film. I don't expect the same tried and tested scenes in his movie. For me the second half of movie was weaker part.\n\nI hope Rajkumar hirani and abhijat joshi will work on better scripts next time. Overall the movie is timepass and watchable but not the masterpiece, we have seen better work from Rajkumar Hirani in his first two movies"

I went in thinking this would be India's version of Animal House or American Pie. But after watching the film, I was in love! It is so much more than the usual college story of young guys getting drunk, flunking classes, and getting back at their superiors. It is an extremely well-made film about doing what you love and facing your fears. The acting is incredible by the ensemble cast. The script is funny and poignant at the same time. Even the scenery is breathtaking. Although the length of the film is pretty long and has some quirky musical numbers, 3 Idiots is a delight. It is worth the watch!"

        "review_detailed_main": "As you can see, I'm a huge movie buff. However, my scope is strictly limited to English-speaking movies. In other words, I have scruples watching foreign movies in subtitles. Nevertheless, I'm completely in the state of idleness for the whole summer. What's even worse, I've run out of American movies to watch since I've basically watched every movie that suits my palate. A friend of mine hugely recommended this Indian movie for me to watch. I was completely reluctant in the beginning to say the least. The title sounds like a Jim-Carrey-parody-like comedy which nothing in it can be literally taken serious. On account of my preference for serious movies, I tend to ignore those \"silly\" comedies. However, my friend's non-stop imploring drove me nuts. To humor him, I decided to give the movie a try.\n\nThe beginning was kinda within my expectation. Two goofy \"idiots\" started to turn the world around them upside down by extremely over-the- top actions(stopping a flight, hitchhiking a limousine), they reached an observatory of The Imperial College of Engineering, aka ICE, their alma mater, to meet a friend they've lost contact for six years. Only to find another classmate, Chatur, who started to boast himself for his success over some guy named Rancho. Until then, I was feeling this movie was no different than any other comedies. However, the following sequences kicked in and I was completely blown away. It all started with a magnificent melody that unveiled the main storyline.\n\nThe main character, Rancho, was a guy who was enrolled in ICE. However, he was totally different than any other students. Instead of studying by rote like any other students, he focused more on the practical aspect of the knowledge. As a result, he was able to shock a bully in the groin with electricity. There was another student like him, who was working on his own helicopter project. However, their director, Virus(a nickname of course) wouldn't allow him to graduate. The heartbreaking rejection ultimately led to the student's suicide. Rancho realized the education system in India was extremely flawed. It suppressed the personalities of all the students, focusing on nothing but the grades. Rancho decided to step up against it. He kept challenging his teachers and even the director. He made 2 good friends, Farhan and Raju(the two goofy idiots in the beginning) and really inspired them. Later, he met a girl named Pia, who turned out to be the director's daughter. A lot of clashes occurred in Rancho's intent to change the education system and even his friendship was put to test. The ending of the movie was so touching that anybody would shed tears from their eyes, with a small twist that would made everything pleasant once again.\n\nOverall, it's really a sweet movie. It can be a comedy at times, with a lot of over-the-top action from Rancho and his friends. However, it's a lot more than that. It's more of an insight into the education system of India, which is similar to those in the likes of other Asian countries like China, Japan and Korea. It can at times be so heart- warming that your tears can't help but surge out like waterfalls. It can be a musical too, with a lot of exotic dances and songs which are common among Indian movies. Great film. Totally change my impression for Indian movies. Easily 10/10."

Still, a lot of people love it, so Stop Taking Your Personal feelings as The Lethal Truth.\n\nTo make you understand better. Let me tell you something about the high school thing. If you have studied in Chinese or Indian High school you will understand what's all about the suicide and sad plot. Life was like a pis of sh!t. You have to wake up at 6:30 and go to bed after like 10:30, you can never choose your class, you can never say anything that against the teacher, you can never be in relationship with boys or girls. Right here, NO PARTY, NO PROM, NO NOTHING. All you have to do and all you can do is study and study, and the only way to make your life better is to get good grades. Because of the hard works and lack of fun, you're totally exhausted while the teachers and parents keep complains that you're lazy. And what's even funnier, is that 80% of what you have struggled to learn has nothing to do with your future life. So it simply sucks here.\n\nThat's why we love the film, it showed our mind, it's not a perfect movie. But it make us laugh and cry. This movie is 9.1 in douban.com(A Really Famous Website in China)\n\nIt's 8 out of 10 for us, and even for some of you. For some of you, it's 6 or 7 out of 10. So, it's 8.1 for average. NOTHING IS WRONG.\n\nSo, please, try to understand."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I told a friend that 3 Idiots is the best film this festive period, he told me it takes an idiot to be able to tell one, and that I saw myself in the film. If anything, I'll take that as a compliment, as the film is about self-actualization, or the simple fact that it's a wake up call in this rat race of a world that we live in, that we lose sight of things that matter in the pursuit of success. It's a wake up call that we should be pursuing Excellence instead, which in the work environment one gets easily drowned in mediocrity, or blind faith that success follows without putting in too much hard work.\n\nSet predominantly in the varsity days and told in chunks of flashback, this film will allow you to reminisce about a time where life was nothing but exams, lectures, and that paper chase, either making the grade or having to repeat. But there's also probably that one person, or a few if you're lucky, whom you'll meet on campus that will help you directly or indirectly, shape your outlook, thinking and just about forming long lasting bonds, whose interaction with will shape your character just before entering the workforce.\n\n3 Idiots tell of such a friendship, amongst 3 buddies Farhan (R. Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman Joshi), two mediocre students who just scrape through, and the one huge influence in their lives, ace student Rancho (Aamir Khan), the livewire of the trio who irks the Dean of Imperial College of Engineering (modelled after the famed Indian Institute of Technology), Professor Viru (Virus), played by Boman Irani. In fact, it's something like a Hindi equivalent of the local I Not Stupid with its critique on the educational system, but done with a lot more finesse, fun and without sledgehammering its ideals down your throat.\n\nThe gist of the disparity here is the concept of learning how to learn, or teaching somebody how to fish compared to just giving the students the fish. It's a reminder that knowledge gathering goes beyond just doing so for exams, and the techniques of blindly cramming will do one not much good later on. It's about the application of knowledge for the real world than to answer papers, and the joy of acquiring such knowledge. It's the 3 Idiots versus the Professor, and their peer Chatur \"Silencer\" (Omi Vaidya who played the role with glee, as the peer bootlicker that everyone loves to hate) who throws down the gauntlet to Rancho as to who will eventually be the more successful of the lot.\n\nWhat made 3 Idiots work remarkably, is the excellent chemistry between the leads. Aamir Khan, the big name as he is, doesn't upstage his co-stars R. Madhavan and Sharman Joshi, as their characters get into various forms of shenanigans in college. Instead they complement one another in their roles, and thanks to makeup, look very much comfortable as their aged selves, and their younger teenage ones through closely cropped hair, and outfits. Aamir aces the role of Rancho as the boy who gets ahead of the pack without really trying and at times being perceived as both the smarty pants and the troublemaker of his cohort, though his sudden disappearance after graduation has made his good friends try to track him down, albeit unsuccessfully.\n\nThe film also doesn't take itself too seriously when the time calls for it, switching quite playfully to ramp up its funny moments, even at times breaking the fourth wall when telling the story of Raju's background (in black and white melodrama no less). The jokes here worked wonders as well, as do the couple of twists that roll along in the 2nd act after the interval, which is somewhat telling of the narrative depth that the film possessed. Songs were breezy and plenty of fun, and I personally enjoyed Aal Izz Well (All Is Well) best, a chant that the Idiots adopted from Rancho, who uses it to calm his heart when it's filled with anxiety and fear. I think it works.\n\nAffairs of the heart though are kept at a bare minimum, when Rancho falls for the daughter of Professor Viru, Pia (Kareena Kapoor). While they start off in quite testy terms, things start to thaw when Pia sees Rancho for who he is, except that the secret Rancho keeps threatens to keep them permanently apart. And that is unless the other 2 pals could help it in their quest to locate Rancho. Everything falls into place at the end, especially telling of the second act when you learn of this secret at the cliffhanger prior to the interval, and this provides yet another emotional sucker punch to your gut when themes like friendship lasting forever starts entering the picture.\n\nChase excellence and success will follow; this film lived up to that tagline in being one of the most excellent I've watched this year. Amongst all the film offerings put out this festive season, my choice for the most uplifting, the most hopeful and a jolly entertaining ride all around with elements of everything only a Bollywood film is renowned for, is this one. Don't miss it, and it goes directly, albeit a late entry, as a contender for my top films of the year!"

I've complained many times about Judd Apatow's excessive footage diluting the enjoyment his casting and material could have delivered in a tighter package.\n\nThis delightful film transcends all norms. It's so well-written and performed that the time flew. The mix of savvy and silly adds up to a joyful package. The smattering of musical numbers kept the fun going somewhat more smoothly than has often been the case. The early conflicts hilariously established characters, setting up the rest. Several moments elicited more tears than I would have wanted others to see leaking from my orbs. The script builds to several terrific callbacks. I'm glad I checked IMDb's Top 250 list and decided to work my way through most of the dozen or two I'd missed. This one truly deserves its place among them."

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched '3 idiots' on the Christmas Day. Being an Aamir Khan fan the expectations were huge. The movie is excellent, absolutely fun filled and hilarious but deviates from its main idea of Education system after the intermission.\n\nThe depiction of education system of India is completely true where each and every prof. is interested only in the fact that you have mugged up his lessons on not. Being an IITian myself I can assure you of this. Aamir Khan is awesome, Sharman and Madhavan are also good as usual. Boman Irani rocks again with his stand out performance. Kareena Kapoor is OK considering her not so important role. The stand out scene of this movie is clearly Omi's 'Balatkaar' speech.\n\nBut considering Raju Hirani previous works, this movie can't be called his best. Its like Hirani hit a double hundred in his 1st one(Munnabhai MBBS), a 50-60 in his 2nd and a 90* in this.Considering all these, I would go with an 7 out of a 10 and thumbs up for this movie. You can surely spend two hundred bucks, it is worth it."

For those who look up to it as the beginning of a trend of quality satire movies in bollywood, I am afraid its a false dawn.\n\nI've seen and thoroughly enjoyed many zany comedies, but those movies are different because they don't try to simulate real world situations unlike a movie based on a serious subject like 3 Idiots. The seriousness of the movie's theme was not reflected in the storyline and/or direction of the movie.\n\nHaving said that, it is enjoyable to watch, being full of lighthearted humour, which makes it worth a watch and I wonder had it stuck to a saner storyline, it could really have been the masterpiece that many have made it out to be anyways.\n\nAlso, since its focused largely, if not entirely on Aamir Khan and the other two so called central characters don't play enough of a role, the movie doesn't seem to warrant the title 3 Idiots.\n\nIts kind of disappointing to see people adulating and hailing this movie as something which is class apart, if it is so, we can and will have to raise that class."

Amazing actor who plays serious parts as well as goofy roles. He kind of reminded me of Johnny Depp. Man is brilliant. The Dean of the school was also hilarious. I know that had to be a hard role to play, but wow did he pull it off.\n\nAgain, must watch for young, old, teens. If you have been through college, it will definitely hit the spot a little more..

        "review_detailed_main": "3 Idiots is definitely an over-hyped good movie. A lot of expectations were associated with the movie since it was going to come from Raju Hirani, the Munnabhai director and Aamir Khan, the perfectionist actor (and producer and director). Definitely the movie is a good one but it falls short of the pre-release expectations. It is a nice timepass as the entertainment value is quite high. The inherent message for the youth to pursue their passion instead of joining the rat race is also exemplary. However, giving a second look to the movie (after the laughters and the first time euphoria have calmed down), several flaws can be seen very easily in the storyline as well as the treatment. Loosely inspired by the novel Five Point Someone, the movie has shown the lead characters as black or white instead of grey, the real life ones. The director has played with the characters as puppets in his hands instead of allowing them to develop normally. The best example is of Chatur (played excellently by the hitherto less known actor Omi). The movie has exaggerated several things and the biggest drawback of the movie in my opinion is that the storyteller challenges the intelligence of the viewers at several places. There are several incidents in the movie totally indigestible for a sensible viewer. Perhaps Raju Hirani conveniently overlooked the fact that his audience is not the David Dhawan's audience who is expected to leave the brains at home before leaving for the theatre.\n\n3 Idiots (even the name is not appropriate), falters at many points and on many counts. However taking the plus points first, it is recommended as a good comedy successful in making you laugh. Further the music is good and hummable. The song about the character of Rancho played with the titles is quite meaningful and melodious. Choreography is quite good. The performances are excellent right from Aamir Khan to the actors getting the lowest footage in the movie. The message for the students to give precedence to knowledge over marks and follow their passion is definitely admirable. The movie impresses and moves the viewer deeply at certain places. It does not give you a chance to identify its loopholes and weaknesses while viewing it for the first time. Very entertaining and gripping indeed.\n\nBut the minus points are too many to categorise the movie as an outstanding (which has been unjustifiably done by several established reviewers). It is necessary (and relatively easy too) to differentiate between an outstanding movie and a good movie. 3 Idiots is good, not outstanding. It is flawed, not flawless. Making fun of a dedicated student (even when he is a book-worm) is not proper, nor is it to blame the head of an institution for a pressurised student's suicide (and an ignorant father for his non-communicative son's suicide). Suicide cannot be given precedence over communication of your anguish and pains. It cannot be glamorised as well. Showing the head of the college as doing ridiculous things just to make fun of him or portray him in bad light is also not a commendable thing. A scientist with 400 patents being so unknown and unidentified and a girl not marrying for ten years, yet not making any meaningful (and successful) effort to search for her lost love, besides males playing midwives and managing childbirth with the help of a vacuum-cleaner are a few among several irritating things shown in the movie. Rancho's distorting the speech written in Roman for Chatur and making him a laughing stock just because of his lack of proper knowledge of Hindi language cannot be justified either.\n\nEven on the laughter dimension, the movie is not a perfect one. Showing the male students time and again in the toilet or pointing at their asses looks disgusting after the first time. The excessive use of the word - balatkar (rape) does not allow the movie to be watched comfortably with all the family members. Does the moviemaker want the children (because the movie has been given a U certificate by the Indian Censor Board) to know the meaning of balatkar (rape) before the proper age ?\n\nRaju Hirani had impressed the Indian audience with his close-to-heart Munnabhai movies. However in this movie, he has not succeeded in living upto his reputation and the pre-release hype of the movie. The movie is excellent in parts only. It's irritating at many places. Overall it is good. It could have been a better one by all means."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've decided to start this review by describing what happened during the screening of this movie in one of my University class to demonstrate just how interesting this movie really is.\n\nOur lecturer has decided to replace one of our classes on a weeknight and during the class, he has decided to show us this movie. The class started at 8 p.m. and as my class consist of students who are used to skipping classes (even the afternoon ones) or are prone to leaving early (including myself), I was expecting the class to be almost empty by the end of it.\n\nBy the end of the class, which was about 11.30 p.m., none of the students actually left the lecture hall because everyone really enjoy the movie so much and all of us wanted to finish the movie because it was fun, interesting and inspiring.\n\nThe movie has tackled an important aspect in the modern society: Why do we study ? Is it only for the sake of getting a well-paid job in the future ? Or was it for the knowledge or interest ? This movie had us questioning our purpose of studying and whether we are doing it for the sake of our future job, to fulfill our parents' demands and expectation or to feed our hunger for knowledge ?\n\nAll of us go to school for a different reason, some to make friends or to hang out with their friends, there are some who really enjoys learning new things everyday but many are those who go to school just for the sake of completing their studies.\n\nThe movie tries to bring out this point through humor, loads of them ! The movie is really funny and through unfolding the events by looking into the past and present, it avoids being too straight forward which in my opinion, keeps the audience interested in the movie without getting bored.\n\nI really love the movie and has always recommended people to watch it, in fact, everyone that I know who have watched the movie loved it. This movie is really one of my favorite movies of all time."

        "review_detailed_main": "There was an article published by Time magazine some years ago. It explained that while China enjoys a robust population and a rigorous educational system (for those who can afford it), the spontaneous and creative aspects of Chinese culture has been subverted. It's been marginalized so much so that American business specialists have been asked to speak at some of china's most prestigious companies to \"teach\" creativity. The article presumes that Chinese middle-managers have had so many concepts and facts drilled into them in school that they are unable to think outside of the box like Americans.\n\nSubtle racism and cold war paranoia aside, the article does have a point when it comes to the importance of academic memorization versus creativity. American public schools have been drawing and redrawing that line trying to find the right balance to mold the leaders of tomorrow with mixed results. Yet when I hear stories of a fifteen year old inventing a new groundbreaking cancer test, I can't help but feel a little prideful of being the partial product of American schooling.\n\nBut while the Chinese seem to be stumbling, India has really stepped up, or at least the film 3 Idiots (2009) would have you believe it. Starring Aamir Khan as the amiable Rancho, the plot of 3 Idiots sounds like a Van Wilder (2002) rip-off. The brilliant but unorthodox Rancho causes mayhem and silliness at an uptight engineering university. His two friends Farhan (Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman Joshi) join in the revelry to the dismay of the pig-headed dean known to the students as Virus (Boman Irani). But when Rancho takes interest in the dean's daughter played by Kareena Kapoor, the dean vows to have the 3 idiots expelled for good.\n\nBollywood films are very good at taking seemingly trivial plots like the aforesaid and escalating them into gorgeous, high energy, thematically complex tales for which 3 Idiots is no exception. The movie encompasses a vastness of emotion and a breadth of themes which I do not dare expand on here for fear of ruining the movie. I will say that 3 Idiots does further validate my hypothesis that a major theme in modern Bollywood is upward mobility. While my familiarity with Indian film is limited, all the films I have seen made over the past twenty years involve a protagonist unhappy with his or her station in life and works their butt off to achieve better, often through creative means.\n\nI saw this theme in the repellently named Wedding Planners aka Band Baaja Baaraat (2010) and the silly sci-fi comedy Joker (2012). Even the sappy love musicals of Yash Chopra like Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) have characters who want to do better largely by questioning the conventions of traditional ways. 3 Idiots is an extension of that proud tradition only done with excellent comedy and some surprisingly depth along with some catchy musical numbers.\n\nStop to consider today's modern American films in comparison. Sure there are classic hero journeys in movie theaters but few have unadulterated happy endings quite like Bollywood. Many settle for the moral of \"do what you can,\" or \"you can be happy with your lot in life so long as you have someone to love\". And let's not forget the common contemporary comedy message \"have fun and worry about the consequences later.\" These messages make sense in the economic malaise of the day and the superhero genre has replaced the musical comedy as far as being a glitzy distraction for the masses. Still the superhero films as well as the Oscar-bait of the last few years don't have the subversive themes of their Indian counterparts. Nor to they have the energy! The energy in 3 Idiots is so incredibly infectious, if you're not smiling in the first five minutes you might need defibrillation. Seriously call a doctor, you're legally dead.\n\nThose who are worried about China's looming domination of Asia and eventual world power status need not worry about it. If I were worried about any country flexing its muscle it'd be India. It's a polyglot, multicultural nation with English its language of commerce. It's got a huge, pro-democratic population and has the creative juices to pull off long-term economic and cultural growth. But don't lose any sleep over the decline of the American Empire, at least our overlords will be benevolent or at the very least hilarious.\n\nhttp://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com"

My only criticism is the title - it's horribly misleading for American audiences who would probably expect a Judd Apatow nonsense film (and offensive to boot). Not so with this film - the characters are anything but idiots despite their college experiences. Brilliantly written and directed, there's something for everyone here: comedy, tragedy, and even a couple of song and dance numbers (seamlessly integrated). The acting is superb, the plot is a bit complex but fascinating, and it's shot with care and attention. LOVE IT."

The film is funny, genius, superb, surprising, fading from touching moments to challenging scenes, so naturally...... Reamrkable photography as well. It's one of the most exciting movies I've ever seen - is deep, enjoyable and, ultimately, leaves a lesson about what is really important in life.... I recommend the family watch this movies, together...is outrageous!!! It mention taboos, the everyday's strive of families, hopes, dreams, disappointing, love, envy, debauch, etc....

It gives me a little hope, a little faith, that success and happiness will eventually come to those who pursue excellence in stead of just focusing on their grades, their qualifications. I guess that many Western people cannot understand what Asian students like me are going through. We have to study all day, I mean, studying is not only a 7 to 5 \"job\" but it also deprive us of our sleep. The working environment is so damn competitive, our parents are like 'get straight A's or you will have nothing to eat' and the stress is unbearable. So, if you are having to deal with all these, give this movie a try! Good laughs, great messages, enjoyable story."

Merry Christmas, viewers, this is the perfect treat. I was lucky enough to have caught a special preview of the year's best movie, 3 Idiots, last night. Aamir Khan fans, after a disastrous Ghajini, prepare to be truly delighted! He once again shows his 'perfectionist' attitude with this highly-anticipated soon-to-be blockbuster! It has EVERYTHING - from good humour, to emotions that actually move you. When a sense of fear is supposed to be created, it is created, and when you're supposed to feel good, you do! Remarkable performances by each and every one of the characters just adds to the entire effect. A nice-to-listen-to soundtrack assures you that even the song sequences aren't boring. And over that, such beautiful choreography! Witty dialogues and hilarious one-liners keep you wanting for more, and some head-bobbing suspense makes you wonder as well...\n\nBut, above all, above EVERYTHING else, what truly, TRULY makes this movie work is Rajkumar Hirani's brilliant sense of direction. How he cuts between the past and the present, at the perfect moments, is just amazing. With this, he could finally emerge as one of the leading directors of the country today.\n\n3 Idiots is based on the book Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat, even though it's hugely different. And, for the first time in my life, I can proudly say that yes, finally, a movie has not just done justice to the book, but easily surpassed it. All thanks to Rajkumar Hirani. And proudly too because an Indian did it! I have to be strict... it's an Aamir Khan movie. So I have no option but to cut off 1 for the editing and dubbing errors.\n\n9/10. What more do you want? Don't miss it for anything!"

It also features a genuinely uplifting message that only hardboiled cynics will fail to appreciate.\n\nYes, it's probably 45 minutes too long, but on the flip side: the songs are fun, the directing is dynamic, and Aamir Khan pulls out his best Indian Tom Hanks performance. Also, unless you're xenophobic, it's fascinating to see love, dreams and life from an Indian perspective.\n\nIf you want to see one Bollywood movie before you die, make it this one.

I'm sure that the people who have given it a 10/10 have never seen any other movie on the top 250 list. It was a major hit in Indian theatres and any rational,logical and a real movie buff can never like this sort of an impractical movie. To be honest, for an Indian movie I'd give it a 6/10 , however on an international scale it would barely get a 5.

Humor is there in large doses, the scenery and landscapes are amazing and the movie is optimistic but also realistic at points. There are moments in the movie when you're laughing and in an instant you may find yourself crying.\n\nIt was long but justified to be and it was never tiring, not at any point during the film.

The whole cast was great every actor played his character very well specially (Boman Irani) and (Aamir Khan) for being 44 years old and performing a younger character with almost no changes in age. This movie is awesome not because of one actor or a couple of actors, it is a joint effort of every member of this movie. The director was good for assigning these actors to play those characters, and the music was good. This was my first time to watch an Indian movie and it's not going to be the last. I recommend it for those who love comedies and they will not be disappointed."

        "review_detailed_main": "I really tried to like this. And just to be fair, there are a few entertaining moments, it's professionally produced, and the performances for the most part aren't that bad. Heck, I'll even go so far as to say all the protagonists are pretty good. But good lord, what an awful script. Melodramatic clich\u00e9s galore, terrible humor (why so many pee and fart jokes?), simplistic messages, a hero who can absolutely do no wrong and villains for whom the phrase \"one-dimensional\" is generous. It's as if someone marathoned through the absolute worst Hollywood has to offer and took notes. The sad scenes are laughable, the comic scenes are painful, and all of it is predictable (except the final little twist, which I admit was kind of a nifty surprise). Much of the film resembles REAL GENIUS, from the unflappable, infallible hero to the evil professor and the suck-up rival. And that's not a movie you want to aspire to. And there's a scene I know I've seen somewhere else before, but I can't place it. Teacher tells student his exam/paper won't be accepted because it's late, student asks if the teacher knows his name, teacher says no, student stuffs paper/exam in the middle of the stack. It'd be a clever bit, if not for this nagging feeling it was lifted from something else. Even the songs aren't that great, although the accompanying spectacle is sometimes charming. In the end, it's the three leads (Aamir Khan, Sharman Joshi and Madhavan) and the romantic interest (Kareena Kapoor) and their endearing performances despite the horrible material that save this from being a complete waste. But I certainly wouldn't recommend it."

        "review_detailed_main": "I love films that draw me into the lives of the protagonists and subtly take me on a ride with them. To me, a good film makes me forget that where I am, what I am doing and who I am for that 2 hours or so. I cry and laugh with the characters. The actors on screen personify their characters and I cannot imagine them in any other role. 3 Idiots is one film that did exactly this.\n\nAt College, they cross paths with various characters. The Dean of the College, Professor Viru \"Virus\" Sahastrabuddhe is an overachiever, having taught himself to write with both hands to save time, among other skills. He has his own idea of the perfect student and routinely patronizes students who do not meet his criteria. This comes down to most of the students at the College. Fellow student, Chatur \"Silencer\" Ramalingam, provides the comedic element of the film. Chatur is ambitious and believes that textbook memorization of engineering concepts is the way to success. He considers himself superior to others at the university, taking shortcuts to impress the Dean. His efforts often make him the butt of jokes and pranks among the trio, one of which earns him the nickname \"Silencer\". Of course, no film is complete without romance, and this is provided by the appearance of Pia, Professor's Viru's beautiful and intelligent daughter, with whom Rancho falls in love.\n\nIn the middle of all these, they crash a wedding, deliver a baby on a makeshift operating table, settle a bet, fall in love and have hopes and dreams broken, all in Bollywood style. The film draws on themes of filial piety, obedience, friendship and the importance of following your heart. It also subtly hints that perhaps while we study, not all of us learn. The trio live, laugh and love with each other while discovering more about themselves. As usual, there is dancing, music, drama, a catchy phrase and soaring breath-taking scenery. The film ends with several twists and leaves you inspired to take a closer look at your life."

It has a little bit of everything and even the few musical parts of the movie fits perfectly.\n\nDirected with a perfect rhythm, this movie rebels against the actual educational system in which the more important is to pass tests but not really achieving new skills than really learns something that is going to be useful.\n\nRancho, the main character of the film, is introduced to the audience as an idealist who defies the system not caring about the consequences, his one and only concern is study hard for learning and achieve new skills. An amazing character that should inspire who watches the film.\n\nDefinitely this movie is not what it looks at first sight, it is a great, unforgettable and inspirational film that gets into the bottom of the heart."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have a bunch of Indian and Pakistani friends and they were all going over the moon with this movie so I decided to watch it. There is one way to describe this movie and that is different.\n\nThe story revolves around three engineering students who bond with each other. Rancho is a brilliant student who prefers to have fun and makes it his duty to help people in any way he can. Farhan is a student who loves photography and was forced to go to the top engineering school by his dad. Raju is a religious student from a poor family that tries to excel in the school. THroughout the movie, they have their little adventures and even a couple of surprises or two in the school they are studying in. While the movie is different from most Indian Movies, the movie is a little long and a little dragged on. While it is primarily a comedy movie and there are many jokes in the movie, most of them aren't that funny and there were some very babyish jokes (people pulling their pants down randomly and people talking to each other while on the toilets). Like most Hindi Movies, there were also some good songs, but one was a nonsensical song that sounded unusually similar to zipadee doo daa. Towards the end (last 45 minutes) the movie also became painfully predictable and did not match the explosive first hour that had me captivated. The message however was very well understood and very well put in the movie.\n\nAamir Khan is an outstanding movie star and he shines in this movie and as I heard he also produced this movie, it greatly resembles his other movie, Taare Zameen Par, in which a kid that is dyslexic rises above the standard and traditional South Asian view that a child must learn a certain way. It parallels the moral of this story in which South Asian communities must broaden their views and be more flexible instead of forcing their children to becomes either doctors or engineers and to not put pressure on their children by asking high demands in education.\n\nOverall, its a movie to watch because of its message."

Lots of old jokes. Some sequences are absurd. 3 idiots can take a old patient to Hospital but cannot take a pregnant woman and applies their engineering knowledge to deliver a baby. They can gather the whole college but not a single girl to deliver a baby. Like I said...its a good bollywood masala movie but nothing great. I don't know why some people are surprised about Aaamir's acting as a college boy. His face is still boyish and suits these kind of roles. May I ask in which film he looked like a Man? Arshad Warsi could have done better job in this movie. Now the good things. There were some good dialogues and good acting from Sharman Joshi(Raju) and Omi Vaidya(Ramalingam). This movie is Chatur Ramalingam's. The producers are clever to market the movie like Ghazni and make their money. After few days we audiences will look back and think how they made fool of us. This movie is worth watching only in DVDs."

        "review_detailed_main": "As someone who has never seen a Bollywood film, and doesn't care much for them, I was skeptical about 3 Idiots. But, I had heard good things and decided to give it a shot. Luckily for me, it is a very enjoyable film. At times laugh out loud funny, at others deadly serious, it's one of those rare films that doesn't break the mold, but still manages to be fantastic.\n\nThe film is primarily about three students who attend the prestigious ICE engineering school. One student, Rancho, quickly makes a name for himself as the student who walks the other way and makes enemies of the schools head, Virus as he tries to enlighten his fellow students Raju and Farhan.\n\nWhile not familiar with Bollywood films, I am familiar with the genres staples, and they are here, including musical numbers, lots of melodrama, and lots of crying. Yes, there is cheese here, but it's a well done film. The characters are enjoyable and the story is wonderfully told. Behind it are issues that, while laid in an after school special kind of way, are very serious. Suicide is even covered here, and it is not handled in a comedic fashion. These issues are taken very seriously and it is the heart of the film. The acting is mostly responsible here for the success of this film, relying on the combined goofiness and drama of the three primaries. I can't say that the film isn't predictable, though there are several shocking moments. But, even with it's predictability, the cast is so charming that it's just something you can sit back and enjoy.\n\nI suppose I wasn't expecting much going in, and at a running time of almost 3 hrs. (something very a-typical for this kind of film), you might think you'd get worn down. But this is a very enjoyable film. Yes, it goes to some very silly places and even seems awkward at times, but by the end, you can't help but smile. Can say I am honestly pleased I took the journey."

        "review_detailed_main": "Talking about unexpected\u0085 When you see the title of the movie and know that it was best grossing Bollywood film that went around the world as a hit all around \u2013 well, you expect something watered down, something for everyone. Maybe in some way it is for everyone, but by far this is not bad.\n\nThe message is simple \u2013 follow your heart, follow your dream and All Izz Good (a little chant of main character \u2013 Rancho \u2013 used in stressful situations). In India engineering is a prestigious occupation where many Indian parents see as future for their sons. Story is set in Nr. 1 Imperial Engineering University where our 3 main characters \u2013 Farhan, Raju and Rancho - meet. Most students are there to blindly cram book, get best scores in exams, get good job and buy big houses and big cars. But Rancho is different \u2013 he loves engineering and does not like the school system, he tries to change it. Sounds familiar? Well it is. But this is story is special. It is about real friendship, real emotions and a person who is able to inspire people, shake their mechanical lives, and wake them up. (Oh, and it has Bollywood song-and-dance cuts too, a lot of fun). It is indeed very pleasant to watch.\n\nAs usual I would like to ponder upon one of notions of the movie. We all in our lives are faced with important choices and struggle to answer dilemmas they give us. Who should we listen to when we choose most important things in our lives \u2013 the Tradition, our Parents and Grandparents, our God or Gods, our Friends, our Hearts or our Rational Mind? It is tough. Sometimes it seems to me it was easier in the times when you knew from childhood who you will be \u2013 a son of blacksmith will be a blacksmith, a son of tanner most probably will be a tanner (well, for girls even more easy \u2013 marriage \u2013 but that's another topic). In Hindu philosophy, in Bhagavad Gita, a similar question is discussed. A great hero Arjuna I faced with a dilemma \u2013 he has to fight the battle, as he is kshatriya, warrior cast, however in this case he would have to kill people he knows and loves. He consults his chariot driver - god Krishna. Krishna tries to persuade him to fulfill his duty, his dharma as kshatriya. It is better to be mediocre warrior if this is your dharma, than to be best cook in the world and go against it. A philosophy difficult to pursue in life, especially in modern world. I personally think that since industrial revolution and alienation of worker and his/her work (to borrow the term from Marx), there is no way to see the profession, a job in the same way as it used to be (like I mentioned \u2013 son of tanner is tanner, but it was not a \"job\" in nowadays meaning). Our jobs are almost a consumer choice, just usually more permanent one. You choose your career along with it comes the attached lifestyle (a doctors lifestyle is different from engineers, and it is not only about the money, it has much to do with the constructed image of the profession). So in ambiguity of modern world, what does constitute as dharma? Rancho says it is voice of your heart.\n\nThe movie has a happy ending. And if it is not pretentious enough for some critics \u2013 well, eh\u0085 I think some things need to have a happy ending.\n\nP.S. I wonder how many engineering students in India dropped out after seeing this movie"

As the journey starts off, their college life and old memories of their friendship, with a unique free-thinker Rancho who inspired them and changed their lives, are unfolded through flashbacks and followed with some twists and turns...\n\nMy Views 3 Idiots looks at our educational system which pressurises the students and does not allow to chose his destination by his own wish, in a satirical way and brings out some of the flaws in it... On parallel there is a love angle between Rancho and Pia (Kareena)... Many of the situations/characters have resemblance or inspiration to \"Five Point Someone\", blockbuster novel penned by Chetan Bhagat...\n\nBoth humour and emotional quotients are amalgamated in the right proportion, full credits to Raju for that... Film offers lots of quality rib-tickling moments throughout.. The intermission point offers a twist that is totally out of the blue and keeps you hooked to the movie ! Just when you think this feel-good comic caper is leading to its culmination, there is another surprising element at the climax which is brilliantly weaved out by Hirani...\n\nTechnically, it rocks with astounding and visually arresting cinematography, the aerial shots of Shimla and Ladakh are a pleasant treat for our eyes... Editing was good... Song visualisations were cool... Music was good and well placed with the flow of the narration...\n\nComing to performances, all of them comes out with convincing portrayals, but it is Aamir Khan, the real showman of Bollywood, steals the shows with yet another stellar portrayal and will go down as one of his best performances. His looks and mannerisms as a college student was genuine and consummate.. Madhavan and Sharman adds up with commendable performances... Kareena does her part well... Among the supporting, Boman Irani as the eccentric head of the institution was too good...\n\nOn the downside, there are some unbelievable filmy situations which can be excused as writer's liberty and the episode of Mona's delivery was a bit far stretched.. Still these minor negatives does not affect this wholesome entertainer ! In short the basic theme of the movie is that \"chase excellence and success will follow\".. Just like that Aamir and Raju has chased excellence and success is following them...\n\nSo to sum up, Aamir and Hirani has delivered the best movie of 2009, perhaps the decade!... Do yourself a favour by seeing this highly emotional and feel good comic entertainer...\n\none of the best movies of the decade... a must watch!"

Actually these kind of people might have realised that they have taken wrong path and that is because of parent's expectation, social status or may be because of peer pressure. There are people who are repenting after making career in the field in which they are not enjoying and have mindset that they would have been done better in some other field. There are parents with the mindset that some educational field are good and some are bad. This is may be because of status in the society, job market and money reward in the field. But by this way they are ignoring inner abilities of their child and take the part in spoiling their career. This is like curing the disease the wrong way by giving wrong drug. This way they are killing their real pleasure. There are girls and guys who repenting after getting married to a person who is so materialistic who running behind only money and has no value for human feelings. Finally this kind of marriage wont last longer and results in the divorce. The film is giving good message to all of above people with humour. Songs are also good and well placed in the movie.\n\nOver all it is another very good movie of Aamir khan."

In an instant, the film can be as dramatic as it is comedic, both equally effective.\n\nThe well selected cast is excellent, especially Aamir Khan (who is always excellent). Through a series of events, the film takes us on a journey of self discovery, with a few life lessons as well. There's something here everyone can relate to.\n\nIncredibly, for a 3-hour long movie, my attention was glued to the screen the entire time. The humor was naturally funny instead of slapstick. (I can just imagine how Hollywood would have treated this type of film - ugh!). '3 Idiots' is a beautiful film that will make you laugh and cry. This was just brilliant with a wonderful ending."

I was hoping the movie wasn't a remake of the book and was glad to see that the basic characters and storyline were picked up and everything else was original. The actors were very believable in their roles - not for once did they look any older than students barely out of their teens and blended really well into their characters. The movie keeps you so into itself and had so much to offer that when interval came, I started wondering what could they come up with for the second half but they came back with something even better!\n\nThe story is of 3 guys - Aamir Khan as Rancho, Sherman Joshi as Raju and R. Madhavan as Farhan going through their 4 years in an engineering college and beyond. All throughout the movie they were their characters and not actors. The movies is beautifully presented and is a laugh riot and has some very emotional moments. It all fits together and you can totally relate to the characters whether or not you went through those 4 years of engineering college like I did. The storytelling is brilliant and it doesn't have second which I found boring or felt like forwarding.\n\nMusic is nice - not great but it fits with the movie. The movie also has a message about the education system in India and is very true.\n\nMy vote : 10 !"

        "review_detailed_main": "I love Chetan Bhagat's novels. I work with many engineers who immigrated to the US from India. Bhagat's novels (especially \"2 States\") help me appreciate the land they came from, that schooled them, and is still attached to their souls.\n\nBoth \"Five Point Someone\" and \"3 Idiots\" tell about students suffering through college and the transformation to adulthood. Both stories are engaging, cleverly constructed and funny as hell, but they show different things, at a different pace. Novels show internal transformation, while movies show the transformation of relationships. Neither story is biographical. Neither story depicts \"reality\". Both stories work as fiction and frivolous entertainment. Both are respectful of their characters.\n\nIf you want great art, read Tolstoy. To learn How Things Work, read Darwin. If you like the Marx Brothers, and you want to laugh your ass off, watch \"3 Idiots\". This is not a movie to make you think (Of COURSE universities in developing countries are lethally competitive) but to bombard you with the unexpected. Which for this westerner included the jarring Bollywood \"let's stop the plot and dance\", though in this case it is \"let's use dance to fire-hose a different set of sight gags at the viewers\". One part of your laughing brain can rest while another takes over. This movie will definitely engage all your humor muscles, including engineer and college nostalgia humor muscles if you have them. If you enjoy \"funny machines\", there are plenty of those, too.\n\nSome parts were beyond me - Silencer's idiosyncratic Hindi becomes mere word-substitution jokes in subtitle, and I'm left to imagine how his non-standard pronunciation and mannerisms are 2/3 of the humor Still, even Silencer and Virus were treated with respect - all the characters were victims of a situation created by colonialism, poverty, desperation, and ambition displacing love. You can cry or you can laugh - choose your movies accordingly. If you want to cry about abused students, watch \"Dark Matter\" (2007). If you don't like fart jokes, don't watch this movie, or read Benjamin Franklin, either.\n\nIndia turns out a lot of films. I'm sure all the elements of this movie are borrowed from others, and if you've watched a thousand movies you won't see much new stuff here. Good artists plagiarize, great artists steal, and these artists robbed the entire film vault. They pasted their swag together pretty well, and in some surprising (to me) ways.\n\nIMHO, a 170 minute movie is too long, which is why I give it a 9. But if they edited it down to 90 minutes, and kept all the best humor, I might have died laughing. It was never plodding, though it slowed from manic to almost sane in places.\n\nI'm buying 4 copies for Christmas presents - I have some godchildren that need their humor centers stretched. This ought to do it."

The trailer looked silly and I didn't really have a reason to watch this other than the fact that it was highly rated. But man was I wrong about this movie. When I decided to start watching it, I had little to no patience and was looking for the first reason to just stop watching it. As the movie progressed, I couldn't stop watching it! It sucked me into a world of comedy, romance, and drama in a way I've never seen used before. It was so unique in the way it was used; it wasn't a typical Hollywood film with every clich\u00e9 scene being used. I quickly found myself become attached to these \"3 idiots\" through great acting and character development. This movie was stuffed with life lessons and ultimately very enlightening. It was all a slam dunk. a 10 out of 10. However, don't get me wrong. This movie wasn't perfect. There was a few scenes where they would break out into song for about 10 minutes which was a little annoying but I could see how it fit into the movie. I just sorta thought it was a bit childish and a little abrupt. But all in all, a very well developed movie. I highly recommend this."

        "review_title": "my take: at the least, you can't say you don't get a full-course meal of movies in one LARGE one",
        "review_detailed_main": "Unlike many who have commented here in the years since 3 Idiots was released in India and throughout the world, I am not well-versed with Bollywood movies - indeed, far as I can tell from his filmography, this may be my first Aamir Khan movie - so my take on this experience may be different from others. It's not even that I can't get into a cinematic whirlwind like this, as other filmmakers in other countries will (sometimes) go for BIG emotions and BIG turns like this one does (Love Exposure was something that came to mind during this, of all things). So if you read what I'm about to say and think I'm full of it or don't know what I'm talking about it, well, the latter may be about right, but I can still share my honest thoughts much as they are. And, as far as the most general impression, overall, this isn't too bad. Is it very good though, or as bad as certain IMDb message board posters might say since its ascension to the top 250 films of all time?\n\nIn short, 3 Idiots is a full course meal of a movie, and it has so many types and moods of movie stuffed into one, like a Turducken or something: it's a broad college comedy, an Alvin and the Chipmunks farce (think about it, with Khan's Rancho as Alvin and the other two idiots variations of Simon and Theodore, sort of, plus the Chatur character as the 4th wheel), a soap opera about strict fathers and their children, a tragic tale about suicide meant to highlight a very real problem in Indian society, and of course for Bollywood a musical, not to mention a kind of moral story of what it means to be a teacher or a student and how to not be so uptight (another subtitle for this movie could be \"The System, They Just Don't Understand!\").\n\nIt's even other things I'm sure, and the tones fluctuate and alter on a dime from one to the next. Case in point, there's a little more than mid-way through the film a very serious turn in the plot; nevermind how exactly it gets there, suffice it to say it's due to some late-night antics from Rancho with pals Raju and Farhan, with Raju most drunk the next morning in class and being forced to decide whether to be expelled or put it all on Rancho. Raju decides to jump out the window, though he doesn't die and he subsequently gets rushed to the hospital. Cue up the sad but (it can't be anything else) supremely heart-felt song that plays over as he is brought to stable condition. Then it becomes a rather crazy comedy of 'how do we wake up Raju' sequence as he is stuck in his, uh, comatose-sort of state and Rancho keeps saying wilder and wackier things to get Raju to wake up. And yet as broad as this is it's still serious... sort of.\n\nA lot of this happens throughout 3 Idiots; for a stretch of time the movie will take on something like a frat-house comedy (that's actually how the film seems like it will take shape early on, \"initiation\" sequence with butt-branding included!) but then it's (duh) also a romance with the headmaster/principal's daughter, Pia (Kapoor, pretty but also a very good actress) and Rancho since he not only is the cool/suave prankster but he also spots the phonies who try to have her hand as a significant other. But then it's also about Raju's sad (in black and white no less!) home life, and then it's also about how to function properly in an academic environment with Rancho sometimes like a, uh, RP McMurphy in Cuckoo's Nest turning the system upside down with the headmaster as the one-note headmaster. And then it gets into a musical number about things like \"All is Well\", which gets finished off by someone jumping off a ledge and to their death, which makes it uh... sad again, as it cuts to the pouring rain at a funeral.\n\nThis may be de rigeur for those who are regulars for Bollywood cinema - for me, it was at times a startling experience, sometimes akin to getting whiplash on a roller-coaster. This is not to say it made the experience intolerable, however. It was surely made as a prestige/high-mainstream comedy/drama/musical-et-al, and it's the kind of movie that will have high-powered, super-slick musical set pieces (not quite as many as I expected, to be fair, and those that are here do stand out well and are the highlights of the movie aside from Khan's performance), and then for the regular musical score it will be some of the goofiest notes I've ever heard outside of a Disney channel show. And for as BIG as the actors go for this material - perhaps, you could argue, they don't have much of a choice - there are moments where there's something close to not subtlety but measured stuff; when Raju confronts his parents with what he actually wants to do with his life, it's a legitimately strong dramatic scene that pulls on the heartstrings just enough.\n\nIn other words, it's probably not what will be the *best* Bollywood movie - some may put it high up there, and that's their prerogative - but if you are new to this style of movie-making (and I don't mean Slumdog Millionaire for the laymans that's basically Bollywood crossed with Danny Boyle), it's a good place to start. It's sometimes quite funny, and sometimes quite harrowing with its drama, and often it's much too much with the emotional manipulation (that delivery scene, my God). It is what it is."

But this movie stands still as a giant proving that Bollywood isn't all about synthetic dream worlds. This is a classic masterpiece with the combination of geniuses.\n\nAamir khan my favorite actor in Bollywood shows here, he not just another actor but a man of wisdom. There are high class Bollywood celebrities, acting in very cheap movies even jeopardizing their well built reputation. One thing I notice on Aamir Khan is that he is not after each and every role only seek for the excellence. As he becomes successful with his career, he improves the way of thinking too. This maturity can be clearly visible in his productions too. (He could be the only Bollywood celebrity with a brain :)\n\nThe plot of this movie is quite interesting and never get bored. Humor, Joy, Sorrow , feeling and everything is there. The specialty that tied my attention to this movie is the Dialogs. They are really a work of a genius. Rancho's dialogs as a college student perfectly call into our wisdom. They contains the thoughts of a philosopher.\n\nThe message given by the movie is astonishing by the end. if it's summarized, \"Don't follow the success, only the excellence. Then success will follow you\"\n\nThis could be the movie that would change my life one day."

        "review_detailed_main": "First he taught us that laughter is the best medicine. With his second venture, he taught us the ways of piece and love through Ghandism. Now, with 3 Idiots, Rajkumar Hirani tells us to chase excellence and success will follow.\n\nI'm a viewer who believes the best way to send a message is through an entertaining way rather than a preachy way. A message through entertainment hits you harder than a boring and preachy one. Films, of course, are not meant to send messages, but it's always nice to see one that does. I honestly believe nobody can do it better than Raju Hirani - Currently the best director of Hindi Cinema.\n\nLike his previous attempts, Raju Hirani makes us laugh, cry and think all in one viewing. 3 Idiots not only introduces you to a new world, but also provides a fresh way of filmmaking and narration. Not to forget that it tackles an issue that not many have touched upon - The Education System.\n\nYears after graduating from college, Farhan and Raju receive a message from an old classmate, Chatur. Chatur claims that he has found their old buddy Rancho. Rancho, a free mind, an intelligent student, a good guy. Why is Rancho so important? What exactly did Rancho do? Why did he leave? Will Farhan and Raju find him? All that is depicted in the next nearly 3 hours of the movie.\n\nTo start, 3 Idiots deals with a few things here and there. Whether it is the poor school system that discriminates and pressures you involving your grades. Whether it's you father forcing you to become an engineer and not allowing you to pursue your dreams. Or even a bright student who fears he may not be able to live up to the high expectations. Finally, 3 Ididots says one simple thing - Chase your dreams, demolish your fears and try your best - Success is a given.\n\nThere are a number of significant moments I totally love in the movie. Aamir's introduction itself is a great start. I'll go on and say another lovely scene is when Farhan and Raju come last and find out where Rancho placed. Of Course, who can forget Chatur's hilarious \"Balatkaar speech\" Just Genius writing. There are more moments to cherish here. The whole climax is lovely. Mona Singh's baby delivery is gripping. Finally, Rancho's real identify being shown keeps you glued and enlightened all at once.\n\nMy favorite part of the film is when Farhan and Raju decide their fates. Farhan confronting his father about his real dreams and Raju's interview - Just amazing moments.\n\nFlaws? I really don't see any. I do want to note that the film is almost 3 hours yet you do not feel like it has been that long.\n\nRajkumar Hirani and his co writer really developed a nearly flawless script here. The lines are just amazing. They are fresh and also have that feel-goodness to them. The screenplay is excellent.\n\nThe music of the movie grows on you. All Izz Well lifts your spirit. Give Me Some Sunshine is amazing. Behti Hawa is also an underrated song. Songs are pictured well.\n\nR. Madhavan gives his best performance in my opinion. His voice over is also a master stroke. He's got a strange innocence to him him this film. It works. Sharman Joshi is no less. He's just first rate. Especially in the scene when he goes to give his interview.\n\nKareena Kapoor is actually acting well here. A great act. Boman Irani is first rate as always. He's just brilliant. His character is sort of similar to his earlier character in Raju Hirani's first film, Munnabhai MBBS. However, there's a huge distinction in Boman's act. Shows the man's versatility.\n\nAamir Khan holds 3 Idiots together all through. I feel he should have gotten the best actor award that year instead of Amitabh Bachchan in Paa (That was a great act too) He looks the role, he's just perfect in every frame. You don't really expect anything less than that from Mr. Khan.\n\nAll said and done, even Aamir would agree with me that the real hero of this film is Raj Kumar Hirani, the director. He's filled the movie with so many wonderful moments, extracted some memorable performances and has given one of the most entertaining films to Indian Cinema.\n\nWhat else can I say? Just a big thanks to director Raj Kumar Hirani, producer Vinod Chopra and actor Aamir Khan for giving us this modern day classic.\n\nIn Munnabhi MBBS - It was a \"jadho ki jhappi\" In Lage Raho Munnabhai - It was \"Get well soon, mamu\" And now, it's - ALL IZZ WELL!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Chetan Bhagat's novel on which it is loosely based, is not a literary masterpiece but it succeeds in selling what it promises. I think a more serious, drama with subtle humor approach should have been used to make a good movie out of that novel. What we have got in 3 Idiots is another addition to the streak of mindless comedies. One movie genre which has suffered the most in recent years is comedy and movies like 'Jane bhi do yaron' or even 'Andaz apna apna' or many of the Hrishikesh Mukherjee's movies are not made anymore. What we get these days is run of the mill gags with jokes copied from youtube (Search 'funny student at exam hall' if you want to see an example).\n\nRajkumar Hirani has tried to emulate the success of Munnabhai films by using the same formula but has tried to pull one too many a stunt this time. Munnabhai movies were fresh, something new always works! Repeating same thing over and over is what killed 3 Idiots. Amir tries hard and gets away with it but definitely younger actors could have done a better justice. Madhavan as an actor and narrator fails big time in this movie. An actor like Sharman Joshi who has done quite decent job till now in comedies isn't given much meat in his role. In fact I would have loved to see him do the role of Rancho! Boman Irani's character is straight out of a cartoon book and its not funny at all. Surprisingly, Kareena Kapoor has done a very good job in the smaller than others role she got. It seems she succeeds in carrying this role forward from Jab We Met!\n\nFinally, I would say that this movie has soul, it has a message(in fact may be one too many ;) but it lacks execution. It fails to stick to this message with heart because of senseless and unbelievable comic scenes which are forcefully thrusted to get some quick laughs but ultimately prove to be roadblocks in the storyline. Many situations in the movie are so hard to believe that you can only gulp them down if the movie was a spoof which it is not. I have seen(and have been a part of) much crazier things when I was in engineering college but still what they show here is simply stupid.\n\nWatch this movie if you want to relax and watch some mindless comedy where you have to apply your brain... 6/10 for me."

The movie takes you in a ride of different feelings. It starts maybe as a common University comedy, but soon reveals to be much more.\n\nThe whole educating system is put under question, behind what is a maybe not so reasonable argument, cause even if there are loads of people that are GREAT for their profession and don't get GREAT grades, the system evaluates only how a person adapts to a standard system to measure knowledge. All the same we can see a very different culture and values. Even in religion.\n\nThe movie is all the time mixing deep feelings and thoughts, with a laugh and a joke. The songs also give the movie a pleasant touch.\n\nAll in all, a movie to watch with A LOT of time, but a great movie to see, even with children to give them something to think about."

Same thing goes here, this one is a good movie, sometimes u see movies to relax yourself. This is a good entertainer.\n\nBut for a movie to become a classic or the top 250 of all time as some people say, u got to have something which you won't forget for the rest of your life. But 3 idiots lacked such substance. The movie's theme is good. The educational system of India is rotten. I perfectly agree to it. Even more the perspective of the common man to their children's education is pathetic, in my eyes. The movie really conveyed that idea.\n\nBut let me ask you a question. Didn't Aamir Khan act in a movie called Taare Zameen Par, which sort of conveyed the same idea. That movie was good. It had heart. 3 Idiots is old wine in new bottle. The wine still tastes good.You can buy it, no problem. But don't b fooled. Don't think its new imported wine. Its still the old one.\n\nIf only the director was a little bit more realistic, I think I would have liked the movie much better. He might say that lot of people liked the movie, but its going to be short lived. He could have made the movie a classic. All was there, script and direction was good, but not up to the mark"

Most of the ones I've seen were wonderfully entertaining but I am far from an expert on Bollywood. Because of this, I have a hard time knowing how good this film is relative to other films from this country. So, consider this when you read this review. This may be among the very best India has to offer or it just seems that way to me.\n\nLike so many Indian films, this is a very, very long film--with a run-time of almost three hours. When a movie is bad or just okay, this can seem like forever, but since \"3 Idiots\" is a very, very good film I loved its length. And, like most films of the genre, it has its share of the usual singing and dancing so foreign to films from other countries. One thing you should know, however, is that defining the type of film it is isn't really easy. Much of it is a comedy, but it also has many poignant moments (keep the Kleenex nearby), some existential moments where they explore the meaning of life and work and it's also a tender film about friendship. And, as my daughter pointed out when she saw the film, she loved that the men in the movie are not afraid to cry--something you rarely see in western films."

Aamir's Rancho is a bouncy, fidgety genius with a golden heart. The 44-year-old actor almost passes off as a 22-year-old collegian, bringing out in his character the juvenile buoyancy and vivacity few actors of his age can. Madhavan and Sharman give ample support from the flanks, but a word of praise needs to be reserved for Sharman who shines equally in dramatic as well as funny scenes. Kareena, sadly, has been relegated to a corner but makes her presence felt in a few well-enacted sequences, but it's Boman Irani who comes up with the best performance in the ensemble with his brilliant portrayal of an eccentric professor. His jawline protruded, his brows pursed, his gait ungainly, his speech lisped, Irani is every bit the vile and virulent Virus he's supposed to be."

        "review_detailed_main": "An experience to behold. This movie evoked the extremities of my emotions. Most here on IMDb have appropriately lauded this flick, so any more appreciation on my part will simply turn out to be quite monotonous. I have penned this review to ponder aloud on the narrow lives of those who hated this flick enough to give it a one star rating.\n\nFrankly, I did not find more than one or two of the one-star reviews genuine. There is this one guy that compares this movie to the other top 250 movies on IMDb. How lame is that! I mean I have known only professional critics juxtapose movies just so that they could rank them; they are simply forced to compare movies. And judging by that particular person's command over the language and his lack of technical knowledge, he was not even remotely associated with any major critic; why then that absurd comparison? This same guy also cited something about the movie liked by 'mainstream dumb folk'. This comment in itself is dumb. Did he know that Shawshank Redemption was a mainstream flick, and that it was rated highly by the same 'mainstream dumb folks'? You are on IMDb for Satan's sake; this is the place where people other than professional critics rate movies. If I was forced to think like critics, I would say that there are more than a couple of movies better than 'Shawshank..'; Pulp Fiction, The Dark Knight, City of God, The Godfather, to name a few. Hope you get the point.\n\nThere were a couple of other guys who actually slammed the acting. I wonder, do they even know anything about acting? Being an actor of a small repute myself, I would have no qualms against the acting prowess of the performers, apart from a negligible few areas that needed improvement. And from a consumer's eyes, they made me believe, and there is no higher praise than that.\n\nWell, if they are hard-to-please enough to rate the movie a one, why didn't any of them comment on the direction? That is because either there were hardly any points in regards with direction that they could criticize, or they are not literate enough to even know anything about direction.\n\nThere was this other guy that liked 'Five Point Someone' more. He felt that the movie didn't do justice to the novella. I can only say that the person's list of favorite books would most certainly not be to my taste. I obviously won't say this unless I had read the book, and I wonder how it was successful commercially. The movie is way better than the book. Hell, I shouldn't even be comparing the two.\n\nSome other guys claimed that the movie wasn't realistic. Now, since when has the Dark Knight, The Lord of the Rings, The Godfather, Shawshank, Psycho, or Casablanca - I could go on and on - been realistic. Some of them may have been based on a real phenomenon, but they certainly were not out-and-out realistic. We watch and appreciate these movies just for the cinematic experience they offer. So don't give that realism crap. Movies are meant to be a figment of someone's imagination depicted artistically.\n\nSome even quoted the movie's similarity to Munnabhai MBBS. Wow, I don't see where that has come from. It's like 'Django Unchained' is 'Reservoir Dogs' all over again. Wake up call! They are two entirely different movies.\n\nDon't even get me started on other haphazard criticisms. There were only 2 or 3 people in the one-two star club that convinced me in regards to their rating. Others seemed more like wannabes or trolls, or simply sad souls. I gave this film 8 stars, and dropped 2 stars primarily because of the songs, and its unnecessary larger-than-life portrayal. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I generally avoid commercial Hindi films but I watched 3 Idiots because I was told that it does things differently. For the most part, I found that to be true.\n\nStory: While the theme of the story is quite valid it's hard not to notice that it was discussed by a very similar Hindi film starring Aarmir Khan recently (Taare Zameen Par). In both films Aarmir Khan plays a similar stand out role which create a continuous sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu. The main story line of 3 Idiots oscillates between being simple, heart-warming and humorous to outrageous and silly. This makes things pretty awkward. One moment you would be engrossed watching a story of two troubled students being helped by benignant idealist and the next moment the idealist starts acting like Jesus himself with infinite wisdom. The story never hits a good balance. Personally, wise cracking Aarmir Khan's character got under my nerves far too often.\n\nActing: Acting for the most part was quite solid with the exception Kareena Kapoor. Either all Hindi film directors want her to act the same role in every film or she has been copy/pasted from another film. Most scenes involving her were predictable resulting all attempts at humor to fall flat.\n\nDirection/Editing etc: The film is pretty long which made me feel that editing was not great. There were a few scenes that were quite irrelevant and overdone. But 3 Idiots packed enough comedy and charming sketches to keep me interested until the end. The characters are skewed so much to black/white and right/wrong; the film gave me the sensation that the director wants me to enjoy the film in one particular way. There was very little to think about after watching.\n\nVisuals: Most of the scenery and visual elements used to drive the story along was quite good and well thought out.\n\nAll in all, 3 Idiots is enjoyable and there are lot of things to like. It's still aimed at the core Hindi film fans but it's accessible enough for others too."

        "review_detailed_main": "It certainly is all over town. Aamir's next has been hyped immensely and it's not surprising if you are not able to find a movie ticket this weekend. But at the end it all boils down to the question - is the movie worth all the hype ?? After watching it, I can say that the answer (quite disappointingly) is no.\n\nTwo college friends - Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan) and Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) embark on a journey to find the third friend / Idiot Rancho (Aamir Khan) who mysteriously disappeared after college five years ago. The film's story is told through flashbacks as the characters journey to Shimla in search of Rancho - the person who managed to change their outlook towards life.\n\nThe problem with 3 Idiots according to me is that although it tackles a very complex issue, it chooses to do so in a light-hearted way which essentially converts this movie into a comedy (something present in abundance in B-Town). No doubt the humor is top-notch and keeps you rolling in laughter but the movie simple fails to connect you emotionally with the characters as opposed to, for example, Taare Zameen Par (2007) which I feel, after watching this, is far more superior in terms of characterization and emotional depth. By the time it reaches the climax, you can well anticipate almost everything that would happen.\n\nAs for the performances, they are top-notch. Undeniably, Aamir is one of the finest and this movie reaffirms this. However, what most people seem to be forgetting is that there are two more actors in this movie who, given the opportunity, are as capable as Aamir themselves. First R. Madhavan as Farhan Qureshi is simply brilliant. Watch the scene wherein he tries to explain his point of view to his parents. Next, Sharman Joshi as Raju Rastogi really shines not just in the comic sequences but in the more serious ones (which the movie has very few). Revealing the sequence in which he shines may act as a potential spoiler but watch out for a scene in the principal's office in which the principal asks him to type a rustication letter. Kareena Kapoor is really a thorn in this movie and her romance with Aamir is something that should have been either toned down or chopped off. Omi as the ideal geek is impressive (more so than Kareena).\n\nThe cinematography is good and breathtaking in the opening song where the lush greenery of Shimla is captured with such finesse that it induces a sense of wonder. The music is good but the songs have not been used that effectively. For instance, \"Give Me Some Sunshine\" not only has weak choreography, but it comes at a moment which severely reduces its impact. The promo featuring that song was far superior (in fact that was what fooled me into believing that this movie could end up as a masterful lesson in life). Some of the sequences could have been trimmed down.\n\nOn the whole, although 3 Idiots is a good movie, it is hard to understand people calling a masterpiece or a breakthrough in cinema. Movies like Taare Zameen Par (2007) or even Hirani's own Lage Raho Munnabhai (2006) are better movies as compared to this. Nevertheless, the movie does provide some really good entertainment so if you're looking forward to just relax and chill out, go for this. For those however seeking some serious depth and a perspective in the life of an engineer, I'd say the movie tries and succeeds in parts but an engineer's life and the pressures s/he faces are a different game altogether. Although the movie it enjoyable, it is far from authentic. And this comes from an Engineer (although an Idiotic one). Now I may get a lot of sore thumbs down on this one but this in my opinion on this movie written in all earnestness. Don't enter this movie with high expectations and you may perhaps find that All Izz (Indeed) Well !!!\n\nScore: 7.0/10.0 !!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Rajkumar Hirani's 3 Idiots is generally a rather entertaining comedy, but as a film it is only partially successful. Though it does have its moments, it never really manages to completely deliver and lacks the power to enthrall. It mostly works as a senseless comic ride and only occasionally does it convince when it tries to convey a message. The film is quite messy in presentation, and it is a tiresome task to follow the proceedings as every now and then the story moves confusingly between past flashbacks and present developments. The movie is good in many ways, and at times it's very funny, but it is the overall product which is faulty. The dialogue is for the most part excellent, so is the visual style, but then, the script lacks focus. While Hirani's direction is quite smart and creative at times, he often tries to include too many elements, and, as a result, the movie often seems to go nowhere. The humour wavers between witty moments of hilarity and cheap, unoriginal gags. And then we also have poor sequences of overdone melodrama and manipulative sentimentality, which are incorporated rather forcibly into the movie and they really fall flat. The entire birth sequence, for one, is one hell of a clich\u00e9. So is the ending, which is sugarcoated to the max.\n\nWhere acting goes, the one who does the best--and probably the only great--job is definitely Boman Irani, who is simply hilarious as the lisping, authoritarian college professor. Aamir Khan looks younger than his actual age but is still too old for his role. Acting-wise, he's just ordinary and offers nothing particularly impressive. Madhavan and Sharman Joshi are given little scope and only few short episodes here and there for themselves so that they don't end up unsatisfied from taking part in this film. They do reasonably well, but Joshi is made to cry far too much, and it really gets on one's nerves. Now who's left? Oh, Kareena Kapoor! Well, she is pretty but she is given a thankless blink-and-miss part which is neither significant nor demanding. That said, though she is hardly there, she does well when she is and her presence is pleasant. The songs are quite catchy and fun, but none of them is particularly memorable. \"Zuby Duby\", however, is superbly visualised and is enjoyable enough. Overall then, 3 idiots is an okay film at best which is flawed and terribly overrated, but in all fairness, it is reasonably enjoyable and may provide decent Hindi entertainment for the entire family. According to me, it is worth nothing more than a one-time watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw this movie on the first day of it's release. My expectations were terribly high from this movie since the Rajkumar Hirani's last two outings were absolute rock solid products in Indian cinema. Somehow Rajkuamr Hirani managed to make 3 Idiots so damn good that he surpassed my expectations! First of all, the casting.. though we have seen Aamir, Sharman and Madhavan in Rang De Basanti together, they still look very fresh together, maybe it is because of the college factor and mainly because Aamir seriously looks like a student in this movie. Boman Irani just had to be part of this movie because he was also there in Raju's last two. Kareena is also there.\n\nThe performances, Aamir has performed brilliantly. He is the total package in this movie! We all know how dedicated Aamir is towards his movies and roles. Aamir analysed the body language of the youth nowadays, the way they talk, and all the connecting details and he implemented them in his acting, which is very visible. He also manages to look 21 when he is actually 43 while shooting this movie! Aamir delivers a power performance, each time Aamir enters the screen you feel immense energy and know your either going to laugh really hard or enjoy the sequence that is going to come! R. Madhavan is very very impactful as Farhan and delivers a great performance, he is known for his impact in movies, even when he has a small role. Well in this one he has a big role, which is only better! Sharman Joshi is absolutely convincing as Raju, the guy that has so much pressure on him. His expressions and everything are marvelous and I thoroughly enjoyed him in this one.\n\nBoman Irani is fantastic yet again, he surpasses all his previous performances and sets a new milestone in his own career. He is just great! Kareena is there for a few minutes, and is effective, though she should have been there more! The concept of the movie is absolutely amazing, we all know Rajkumar Hirani makes movies with a great entertainment value, but at the same time an intelligent social message. He is able to do that again this time, and how! Rajkumar also sends a new hype into the population of India, with Munnabhai MBBS it was the \"Jaadu ki jhappi\", with Lage Raho Munnabhai it was \"Gandhigiri\", and with 3 Idiots it is \"Aaaaal izzz well!!\". I am already using this line on a daily basis, lol! The music of the movie is great, Shantanu Moitra's songs always grow on people slowly, after coming from the movie, all the tracks have been stuck on my head, plus point for sure! The cinematography is top notch again, they have shot at a real college, with real students around. Which creates a very convincing atmosphere in every sequence! The editing of the movie is very very good.\n\nAll in all, 3 Idiots has impressed me so much, that I am willing to say this is the best Bollywood movie I have seen YET! A true milestone in the history of Indian Cinema.\n\nGO WATCH IT WHILE YOU STILL CAN! P.S. There are some ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS sequences in the movie that are going to make you cry because of laughter for sure! 100/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Chase excellence and success will follow\". This is what Rancho (Aamir Khan) preaches in 3 Idiots and Rajkumar Hirani delineates the ideology with such adroitness in every aspect that it marks a monumental event for Indian cinema. In terms of the sheer inspiration that it instigates, this film resembles the greats of 'Rang De Basanti', 'Taare Zameen Par' and the 'MunnaBhai' series while being the most entertaining film after 'Andaz Apna Apna'. After introducing simple but relevant concepts like 'jaadu Ki jhappi' and Gandhigiri to the population at large, Hirani now teaches us 2 more concepts:\n\nConsoling the heart by saying 'all is well' may not solve your problems but it will give you the courage to face them. Being an 'idiot' in an institution that chases grades and success is absolutely fine if you are in the pursuit of gaining knowledge and exploring your own talent to its potential. Our system needs to evolve in order to encourage us to pursue what we really want to do with our lives. As Rancho rightly criticizes the Director of the ICE about the college having produced numerous rankers but not a single student who has been creative enough to invent anything with what he has learned.\n\n2 of the idiots, Farhan (R. Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman Joshi) leave everything they're up to and along with their dorky college buddy Chatur (Omi Vaidya) begin a journey in search of their long lost friend Rancho, who left them abruptly several years ago. This beautiful journey through Shimla, Manali and Ladakh sends Farhan down memory lane to reminisce the manner in which a free spirited 'Rancho' entered their lives and changed them forever.\n\nThe non-conformist Rancho rightly questions authority that suppresses free thinking. Every class that he attends is a revelation of sorts for the professor and the students alike. Through outrageously funny incidents and scenes, Rancho gradually changes the way his friends run the relentless race. His influence even spreads to the director's daughter Pia (Kareena Kapoor), leading to even more outrage for the Virus. Through all the hilarious series of events, Hirani also voices his ideologies in some deeply moving scenes to give us an insight into the flaws of the educational system. Its demands are severe on students who are forced by parents who dream for them on their behalf and families that live in sheer misery hoping for the son to become a money-making engine. The latter is humorously depicted as a typical 1950s family in black and white melodrama that makes you sympathize and laugh at the same time. Touch of genius there...\n\nEven after a shocking twist at the end of first half, the film continues its pace while never losing the steam of entertainment. The film's climax is shot in the spectacular landscapes of Ladakh. Speaking of which, the cinematography CK Muraleedharan is outstanding! After painstaking attempts to shoot at the heavenly location, he did manage to catch it in all its majestic splendor. His work overall gives a real, enriching look to the film.\n\nShantanu Moitra's music WILL not sound like the most appealing when listened to prior to watching the film. It is the manner in which the songs are timed in the storyline and the relevance of the lyrics with the characters that enables the music to grow on you. Give me some sunshine and Behti hawa are the examples of this. All is well was a super-hit from the on-set itself with its catchy theme.\n\nAs the usual case is with Hirani's films, the performances are impeccable. Boman Irani as the oppressive director must feel at home with his role as a dean but he still has the ability to impress us with his remarkable portrayal of Virus. Kareena Kapoor has proved her talent in a role that did not require her Kambaqt Ishq attire but rather her true self as a good actress who, when given the right role to work with can prove to be worthy. Omi Vaidya is a discovery here. His speech on stage is one of the most hilarious moments in movies and his inept Hindi and dorky behavior are aspects of his brilliant performance. R. Madhavan shows finesse and a lot of confidence in playing his character. His scene with his father, Parikshit Sahni is the epitome of his performance. Sharman Joshi has displayed his comfort with comedy before and it is a delight to watch him repeat his act from Rang De Basanti rather than that of his other films. Aamir Khan once again, shines light on a rich, well scripted character. His brilliance levels with his commitment as an actor. He proves yet again that true performances only come with understanding and studying the character that one has to portray. He frankly has too many noteworthy scenes but he is at his best while confronting the impregnable Virus. He is the voice of Hirani's ideas and creativity and an astounding personification of a character only he could've played with such virtuosity.\n\nBut 3 Idiots is not all about how great Aamir was. This film is extraordinary because it gets the most rudimentary part of film making right - the screenplay and script. With the combined talents of Abhijat Joshi and himself (story, screenplay, dialogs), Hirani's basics in film making achieve overall perfection. There is something unique and entertaining happening in every scene and you would kick yourself if you take a restroom break.\n\nIt would suffice to say that 3 Idiots is a landmark film and is set to become one of the biggest blockbusters by the virtues of Rajkumar Hirani and that of his immensely talented team including some of the finest actors. This film deserves multiple viewing and you know what?.... You'd still want to watch it again.\n\n9.505 on a scale of 1-10."

His performance stands out...one of his top 3 performances I would say...\n\nWhat makes this movie special is the way facts (positive as well as negative) about our education system have been put forth. Serious issues like students committing suicide under the pressure of performing well in the academics make you sad, concerned and angry at the same time.\n\nAnother point to be noted is, Rajkumar Hirani has done an exceptional job in getting a college student out of all 3 actors (Aamir, Madhavan and Sharman)\n\nI strongly recommend watching this movie. Don't miss it."

        "review_detailed_main": "When did the last time you had the feeling while watching a Bollywood movie that you are watching the best film ever and then suddenly after the movie gets over you start to get mixed feelings about the movie you saw. Admit it; it has frequently been this way. And then what do you do, you go to watch the movie repeatedly to reinstate your earlier feeling about the movie. The hysteria and invincibility that Bollywood makers manage to create in their storytelling, is what makes it so special. '3 Idiots' is the latest of such hysterical movie with such aura around it.\n\nRajkumar Hirani's latest offering is based on a popular cult novel '5 point someone' by Chetan Bhagat'. So, it's easy to have lot of expectations for this film right? Wrong! See, this is not Chetan Bhagat's first novel adaptation to the big screen, it's his second. The first one was a disaster called 'Hello' based on his book 'One night at a Call Center'. Hence, there were lots of apprehensions about his latest book to screen adaptation. But hopes were there for the creative team for the film production and the star of the film Aamir Khan. Both Rajkumar and Aamir have impeccable record and status in the industry. Hence, the opening they got for this film was not surprising, even with the steep Ticket prices. But, when the word of mouth began that this is the best bollywood movie ever made, the expectations crossed the limits. And the film about three engineering students in Imperial College of Engineering (a.k.a. a reference to Indian Institute of Technology) does not disappoint. The story is with difference, but the characters are clich\u00e9d and true stereotypes of their species. Even the several of the movie sequences that make us laugh in the movie are far beyond being original. But the story is new and relevant to today's youth. Engineering and medical fields of study has started to take a toll on today's youth and the more than half a dozen student suicides that you would witness and hear in the movie is not at all a overreaction. It is turning into an epidemic; hence this film is definitely important. The young India is lapping up the support this film provides to their cause with great hysteria and is enjoying the many jokes and potshots the movie takes on the countries rigid educational system and social norms. The quirky and over the top turns that the lives of these idiots take is bringing joy and happiness to the young India. I should mention the best written character and surprisingly the best actor of the film 'Chatur'. Chatur is the typical Indian student that one sees around the campuses of Indian Colleges. Played by newcomer Omi Vaidya, it is the character the audience loved to see fail. Though he does not, his sequences have brought cheers across college campuses in India. The hysteria of '3 Idiots' becomes easy to decipher for the Indian audience and hence they are flocking the theater with large numbers and are cheerfully encouraging the next person to go watch the film.\n\nFor rest of the world this film is irrelevant and has nothing new to offer in terms of the movie flow and character development. But if they are able to put that aside, they would too probably enjoy the funny moments that this movie provides and would end up saying that this is the best Bollywood film they have ever seen."

Nothing in this film made me want to continue viewing; poor acting, a poor script and horrible cinematography are among the worst I've ever seen.\n\n3 Idiots may be a favorite in it's homeland, but as a foreign viewer to India, I had a huge problem with viewing it. The jokes fall flat, very flat and the story feels juvenile and childish. 3 Idiots is among the worst in IMDb's top 250 and I discourage viewing at all costs."

        "review_title": "Bollywood comedy blockbuster: pee jokes and wholesome life values",
        "review_detailed_main": "Released around Christmas 2009 in over half a dozen countries '3 Idiots' , reportedly the highest grossing Bollywood movie of all time, earned $70 million worldwide within 18 days of entering theaters. It was also officially released early to YouTube, another first. In the US, where it's being being shown at AMC/Regal theaters, it made $5.5 million in its first 17 days, the highest US take for a Bollywood import.\n\nSo what is this paragon? No 'Slumdog,' it's much more a standard commercial Indian film product. That means it's long, it's got tears, laughter, excitement, music and dance, and homilies about work and family. It's got romance, a beautiful girl who finds the hero in the end, and it's got running pee and fart and bum jokes. The screenplay of '3 Idiots' is drawn from Chetan Bhagat's 2004 bestseller Five Point Someone, a novel initially published in English and later reissued in Hindi. Bhagat's novel deals with the college exam angst and romance issues of three student buddies. But the film goes further afield, including childbirth during a blackout due to a monsoon flood, travels through gorgeous mountain landscapes of Ladakh seen from the air, trips back and forth over the period of a decade, one marvelous scene when a professor's mass of equations and symbols float off the blackboard up into the lecture hall, caressing the students. There are several full-dress Bollywood song-and-dance numbers, one in a hospital. The bright-colored cinematography is pleasant to look at. '3 Idiots' is virtually an epic of shared coming-of-age experiences with wholesome messages. These are: be true to yourself, live your dream. Be positive: the hero's mantra is \"Aal izz well.\" Don't cheat -- unless you have to in a good cause. Don't rely on memorizing stuff; think for yourself. Avoid obsessing about the price and value of things. Remember where you came from. Remember your friends. The pressures of school in India where it may be the only way out of poverty are made clear, including the high incidence of suicide among students.\n\nAnd learn Hindi. There's a sequence when a nerdy materialist who lived abroad and didn't study it much is chosen to give a public address in a high-falutin literary form of the language, ending up with some lines in Sanscrit, which he's even more ignorant of. The buddies inject naughty substitute homonyms like the equivalent of \"screw\" for \"serve\" and he becomes a laughing stock.\n\nIt's this materialistic memorizer bloke, Chatur Ramalingam (Omi Vaidya), who starts off the pre-title sequence by calling Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan) to say he's located their engineering school pal \"Rancho\" (Aamir Khan) who disappeared after graduation. Farhan has to take the annoying and materialistic Chatur along as he rounds up best buddy Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) to drive from New Delhi up to the mountain town of Shimla to find Rahcho, the pal who influenced and inspired them so much. Much of the film consists of flashbacks along the trip of all the many incidents that happened in engineering school, many involving the annoying and sadistic school principal Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), AKA \"Virus,\" who has a beautiful daughter, Pia (Kareena Kapoor).\n\nThe mercurial and diminutive Khan is so talented he gets away with playing Rancho as a student even though he's forty-something. Rancho is a compelling character: he's the inspiration, the catalyst a young person needs to move beyond his origins and live his dreams. Farhan is from a middle class family and has a huge talent for nature photography; his dad has pushed him toward engineering but he hates it. Raju comes from a dirt poor family -- images of his sick father, unmarried sister, and failing mom are in old-movie black and white -- and the way the family's future is resting on his engineering degree so terrifies him that he continually panics and fails the school tests. But he's a tremendously decent, soulful fellow whose rigorous honesty ultimately wins over potential employers. Rancho, whose origins are as obscure as his brilliance is evident, bows to no one and gets away with all kinds of infringements of the rules because or his inventive mind and fundamental decency.\n\nThis summary barely scratches the surface. '3 Idiots' moves with precipitous speed through a dizzying array of incidents. A puzzling surprise comes just before the mid-way \"Interval.\" And I said it was long. With that \"Interval,\" the movie keeps you in the theater for three full hours. That's a lot of Hindi, and only a little English. But this feels like a cleansing, warm bath after Judd Apatow and Eddie Murphy. This is good entertainment, and it's neither mindless nor nasty. But is it art? Is it groundbreaking? No, one couldn't say that. It's just a breath of good humor and good sense from a more innocent place."

There were a lot of funny scenes which had the audience in splits. The comic timing of all the actors Amir, Sharman Madhavan and Boman Irani was really good. Chatur is just remarkable, what a launch for him. And when I came out at the interval i was pretty happy. I thought the film would continue in the same way in the second half.\n\nBut the second half was too filmy. I mean what was Javed Jaffry s character doing in the film? His character was most confusing and unbelievable. I felt that the romantic angle was totally unnecessary and a bit forced as if just introduced to put some masala in the flick. Had the writers stuck to the basic plot about fun in college and avoided romantic side-angles, it would have been more crisp and slick.\n\nI thought the film would focus also on all the fun in other years, college fests labs etc. But they missed out on all that. And, the pregnancy scene could have been avoided. That was too \"filmy\". But otherwise, good story with a nice social message about the lopsided educational system in India. Hope some teachers and people involved in the education industry watch this movie and try to do something to correct our outdated, one-sided education system.\n\nThere is another thing that stands out in this movie- the cinematography. whether its the college ambiance at IIM Bangalore or Shimla or Ladakh etc. has been nicely captured. Music is also good and keeps you entertained.\n\nThat said and done, this movie is just an entertainer.Just leave your brains at home while watching this, especially the in the second half."

        "review_detailed_main": "I just finished watching 3 Idiots and was rather glad I gave it a chance! The high rating on IMDb roused my attention to its existence, however the title seemed to suggest some slapstick tale (of which I am also partial too from time to time), though as I read the synopsis I became intrigued with the premise of a comedy/drama/Bollywood/musical set mostly in a college campus. I couldn't think of anything I'd ever seen before falling into all of these categories simultaneously and I also felt I needed to give Bollywood a bit more of a chance as my repertoire is quite slim in this department to date! I won't say much about the plot (my summary is about as much as I'd like to give away), as I watched the movie pretty blind of what was to unfold and I really felt swept away in what at times felt like an epic journey of twists and turns; nothing too ridiculous to prompt a 'WTF?!' response, I felt the pace of the film moved really nicely along with realistic and believable scenarios interjected not for shock value but to aid the storytelling. The characters were well fleshed out and I really came to feel a sort of camaraderie with this not altogether hapless but lovable bunch with the main character Rancho, especially likable despite his bad-boy status with the Director of the college 'Virus'. Sometimes I felt a few scenes played out a little like a spoof, feeling slightly cheesy, however I have a feeling some of this vibe came from the cultural gully you often find with having to rely on subtitles (though as another reviewer said, pidgin English is used throughout the film so sometimes you don't need the subtitles). If musicals make you cringe then I guess you may feel a bit like the scenes with sporadic bursting into song are unnecessary, but you have to not only expect this from Bollywood films but also value it as an important part of the storytelling in its own right; plus, the songs in this film are catchy, well crafted and appropriate for the mood attempting to be set. As a final note, if someone was to ask me 'what makes a great movie?', I'd probably answer something like this; It should make me laugh and maybe cry, then come away thinking more about the film and its underlying meanings. Characters should be well formed enabling me to fall in love with them (or even begin to hate them) so, caring if they live or die; to feel their pain and joy and be able to absorb myself into their adventure as though just one of the gang. The look of a film should make me want to make screen-shots just so I could take a closer look at the subtle fleeting beauty that is a single frame, and together, the mosaic of images creating a flow so appealing to the eye that it lends a resonance to the script and plot without distracting you from the deeper message. With that in mind I'd say '3 Idiots' succeeded on many levels and left me feeling satisfied, unlike many highly praised blockbusters of late which have left me feeling jaded and apathetic. There are a couple of scenes where, should I dare say it, 'The Sound of Music' came to mind, though I won't say why other than perhaps the beautiful scenery and the innocent feel to the actions of the characters in comparison to the overly sassy and promiscuous teenager of many Hollywood films these days. Overall, I think my score of 8 is fair given how the movie made me feel, it's lasting impression on me and the fact that I could easily watch it again- perhaps even adding it to my favorites list. I would recommend others to give it a go, even if you're not partial to musicals or Bollywood, or subtitles- so what?! You can always be surprised and I have a feeling you might be!"

Besides the funny parts - expected from a self described comedian movie - the movie was disappointing me... until it started the second part. This final part added the drama needed for a perfect movie: it showed us real human problems. Even more: it showed how to solve it. All in a funny way. The main problem of the movie was: should we follow our heart to do what we like in our professional choice or just do what our parents \"suggests\"? Other secundary problems - but not less important - were showed as well and all the adventure to solve it made the movie simply beautiful. Highly recommended."

The use of comedic flavor and serious drama complement each other perfectly to develop the central theme of the movie (which applies to a lot of people studying in countries where rote memorization is the primary approach used to study). Omi Vaidya is the actor that I felt really stood out in this movie. Aamir Khan and the rest of the core actors did a wonderful job in their roles, but Vaidya presented the perfect impressions of someone who has been corrupted by the flawed educational systems of these Asian countries.\n\nAs for the rest of the components, they were absolutely outstanding. Hats off to Hirani and Chopra for meticulously developing a very realistic script and conveying a strong, profound message at the end. I felt that the inclusion of some of the songs was unnecessary, but that's just my opinion. This movie does span almost 3 hours, but the 3 hours will pass by like water roaring down from a waterfall.\n\nWhenever you get a chance, watch this movie. Not only will you laugh and cry, but you will also be able to take back a very valuable life lesson.\n\n10+/10"

Lets face it, its a complete blend of Dil Chahta Hai, Rang De Basanti, Munnabhai MBBS..and other lesser known college dramas. The message is way too out-and-out..it could've been subtle, lined with situations carefully and intelligently weaved into the plot. 40 plus actors playing college kids is blasphemous! Stereotypical character development, average acting, old timer jokes..it just doesn't fit. The movie couldn't raise my interest even a bit. And I'd make a special mention of the wedding scene, reminded me of Aamir's Dil Hai Ke Manta Nahi. Its just one of those typical Bollywood mix 'n' match flicks with absolutely no soul. I really don't understand the hype and hoopla about it. Below average."

Education is the most important thing to have a bright future. Not only for people, also for countries. \"3 Idiots\" show the importance of correct educational choices and how teachers and parents play a very important role. The movie gives that message in an entertaining way but also touch people's heart. Although the movie is about India and Indian educational system, so similar problems happen every corner of the world. After I watched this movie, I knew I would watch it again.

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched \"3 Idiots\" upon the recommendation of my cousin. I believe this is the first complete Bollywood film I have seen.\n\n\"3 Idiots\" is a film that goes from the present time, to flashbacks of the lead characters' college days in engineering school. Pals Raju (Sharman Joshi) and Fahran (Madhavan) are looking for their best friend Rancho (Aamir Khan) with whom they have lost contact since graduation. Amidst the juvenile school jokes and musical scenes in bathrooms, the story is sending a serious message that learning is more than just rote memorization. Life is about following your own dreams. It also tells us not to face life with fear, overly relying on religion and charms.\n\nThere are so many over-the-top scenes in this film which runs more than 2 and a half hours! There was a long scene about a speech where the word \"served\" was switched with something considerably more vulgar. Funny but went on too long. This may be funnier for people who speak Hindi than those of us who rely on translation. There was a very long scene about a storm, a brownout and someone giving birth. Dramatic but again overstretched and unbelievable. There was also an unexpected sequence about suicide that did not sit well with me in this supposed comedy.\n\nI personally liked the simpler poignant scenes that deliver a bigger punch, like the scene with the Prof. Virus and the pen, the scene with Fahran and his dad, the final revelation scene at the end. There were also some nice scenes with Rancho and the young doctor Pia about her fianc\u00e9 who seemed to be more concerned about how expensive things were, than about her.\n\n\"3 Idiots\" is generally fun to watch, except when the jokes became too toilet or too mean for comfort. There was a lot of suspension of disbelief at the time sequences of a lot of what happened, sometimes not too logical. I could not believe that the actor who played Rancho, Aamir Khan, was actually already in his mid-40s, and yet there he was still credibly playing a college student. Overall though, I did enjoy this, my introduction to Bollywood film. Time to discover more about movies from this part of the world."

Absolutely fantastic movie which I believe is going to be one of the classics like Andaz Apna Apna was - an all time favorite movie you could watch any time and any number of times.\n\nRaju Hirani comes back with a masterpiece and it has perfection written all over it. Nice story, nice narration, superb acting and great direction. I was hoping the movie wasn't a remake of the book and was glad to see that the basic characters and storyline were picked up and everything else was original. The actors were very believable in their roles - not for once did they look any older than students barely out of their teens and blended really well into their characters. The movie keeps you so into itself and had so much to offer that when interval came, I started wondering what could they come up with for the second half but they came back with something even better!\n\nThe story is of 3 guys - Aamir Khan as Rancho, Sherman Joshi as Raju and R. Madhavan as Farhan going through their 4 years in an engineering college and beyond. All throughout the movie they were their characters and not actors. The movies is beautifully presented and is a laugh riot and has some very emotional moments. It all fits together and you can totally relate to the characters whether or not you went through those 4 years of engineering college like I did. The storytelling is brilliant and it doesn't have second which I found boring or felt like forwarding.\n\nMusic is nice - not great but it fits with the movie. The movie also has a message about the education system in India and is very true.\n\n10/10 :)"

It is a very good film, which tells a bit about the pressure that students suffer in universities, pressure from teachers and family, the movie does it very well, arises every time the question should I do what I want or what society wants me to do, it really is a film that makes us think about it. Who's student will identify much with the film. The main actors are fantastic and do very well its role, giving emphasis to the 'Rancho' Shamaldas Chanchad played by Aamir Khan, the film revolves a lot around this character and it just improves the value of the film. The soundtrack is incredible, and are sometimes accompanied by funny scenes and very sad too. Definitely the best Indian film to date. I left movie satisfied.Do not follow the success to have excellence, follow the excellence and success will run behind you."

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, I rarely watch Indian films; secondly, I think this highly-praised Indian film is overrated. There is no doubt this film is a quite entertaining one, but nearly nothing special is worth mentioning here, one can easily feel that the director exaggerate to stuff all kinds of popular elements in its 160 minutes (I like the songs though), universities' educational method, the genuine friendship, money is not the most important item in the world (don't marry an over-materialized man), a choice between what I want to do and what parents want me to do, blah blah blah....\n\nThe film deals with a quite grand topic, the meaning of life, and luckily its scholastic didactics has not reached my threshold of intolerance, as a result I enjoyed most of its screen time, however, my absent-mindedness did come forth several times.\n\nActually the general principles which the film tried so hard to convey are conventional, everybody knows, what the film achieved is to manifest it in a perfect cinematographic world where everything is too idealized to happen in our mundane world. Lack of empathy and a shoddy script makes the film fade like a forgettable fairytale.\n\nAll the characters are stereotyped, the suspenses do not persist long enough and the whole film is skimpy of plausible explanations for most its plots. Still I give a 6/10, an eligible rate, thanks to Aamir Khan's lovable performance. I don't think the film represents the highest standard of contemporary Indian films, nevertheless the inconvenient truth is that it failed to encourage me to watch more Indian films at the same time, what else can I do? There are numerous films are waiting in lines for me to watch, I don't want to waste my very limited time."

Rajkumar Hirani's 3 Idiots, my introduction to the world of Bollywood cinema, is a comedy-drama unlike anyone I've ever seen, long, but never drawn out, frantic, but never desperate, and emotional, but never manipulating. It provides us with three of the most likable characters of the last decade, and with insight to the culture of Indians and their parents. Rarely has a comedy had this big of a brain in its head and a canvas of opportunities in mind, while possessing a title not even fit for a farce. 3 Idiots recite when they become frazzled or nervous, while frantically tapping their hearts. They know that reciting the oversimplifying phrase will not provide their problems with a solution, or even a catalyst, but it gives them the onset courage they desperately need at a time of uncertainty and despair. One character even tries to use the line after an amateurishly-given birth may have gone terribly wrong. It's times like that when the saying may not be so effective, even if its goal is not to provide certain relief."

        "review_detailed_main": "Alright. I know the title sucks. The first image it brings to one's mind is three cross-eyed, bald men with fingers shoved up their noses or something, which wouldn't be a lot off the mark from what the real picture is - three college-brats scratching fake, shiny, resplendent buttocks. But Shakespeare said 'what's in a name?' and let us assume that the great bard was not being rhetorical and delve further into the movie.\n\nInspired from the book '5 Point Someone' by Chetan Bhagat, or as some critics call him, Satan Bhagat, or the IIT-IIM-douche bag, the movie is about three college students in Imperial College of Engineering, the best fictitious Engineering college of India. Each has a history of his own, and while the past of two of them is open in front of us like a book, the life of the third is barely revealed in the first half. Raju (Sharman Joshi) is the stereotypical nerd, haunted by poverty and has a paralysed father and a mother with a total disregard for hygiene, while Farhan (R. Madhavan) is the dilemma-stricken, schizophrenic (not literally) who is studying to be an engineer but his alter-ego (not literally) wants to be a wildlife photographer.\n\nMuch through the initial half, the movie focuses on the trio's life in college. There is fun, frolic and all the other juvenile stuff with occasional mentions of suicide, pressure and the sort. The film tries to accomplish too much in too little only leaving behind a residue of laughter and a feeling of nostalgia for people past their 'my-college- life-was-so-awesome' stage.\n\nRancho (Aamir Khan) is the protagonist of the film. The smartest among the three, he is also the most gregarious and wild. He is a philosopher, experimentalist and conducts innovations in his room or drifts into monologues about success, how-to-study and other inspirational things. Though not a geek, he trumps the obnoxious mega-nerd, Chatur Ramalingam (Omi Vaidya) in their results, which marks the inception of a long- lasting rivalry, which soon boils over after Rancho plays a particularly nasty prank on the latter. The rest of the story, as Bollywood cinema goes, is about a ghastly principal with a lisp (Boman Irani), friendship, love, pregnant women giving birth using a vacuum cleaner and other pea-brained escapades.\n\nThe twist comes mid-way through the movie, thoroughly inappropriate and mistimed. After this point the movies seems to drag on. The humour turns more contrived than nonchalant. The emotions become mawkish instead of touching. There are things that are absolutely implausible in any universe. The movie splashes water onto the sand castle it had built in the first half. The end is hypothetical at its best and this only worsens the case. It manages to leave a 'what the hell just happened?!' taste in your mouth, and I am pretty sure that the movie director, Rajkumar Hirani, wasn't trying to accomplish that.\n\nHowever, the three lead characters play a grace-saving role; Aamir Khan in particular. It is difficult to find chinks in the acting armour. The then forty four year old Khan brilliantly morphs into the twenty- something Rancho. Giving a flawless performance, he makes you happy when he laughs, sad when he cries and sway-along when he dances. There is an innocuous air about him which is highly appealing, with some members of the female contingent even defining it as 'cute.' Sharman Joshi, one of the most underrated actors of Indian cinema, dons the clothes of Raju Rastogi seamlessly. He looks tailor-made for the role; right from being the economically-challenged superstitious nerd, to getting inebriated and imitating the working of an induction motor, his acting is like a breath of fresh air. Though Madhavan appears slightly sidelined as Farhan, he manages to hold onto the boat well. He is overshadowed by the other two, who are more distinctly characterized, but this is covered by the fact that he is also the narrator of the tale. He entertains us with his antics (which involves stopping an airplane on the runway), his affable nature and always being Rancho's faithful sidekick. Boman Irani does a commendable job as the uncanny principal Viru Sahastrabuddhe, a part similar in ways to the evil Dr. Asthana is Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. The others too meander through; Kareena Kapoor, Javed Jaffrey, Mona Singh and so on, each well placed in their shoes, but none leaving a lasting impression.\n\nComparisons with the book are inevitable and the film deserves due credit for being one of those rare books that outdoes its paperback version. But then again, comparisons to a wad of used toilet paper are hardly a standard to go by. Most songs are better than the other blockbusters Bollywood has churned out in recent history. They aid the emotional segment of the film. Yipee for that. While the first half of 3 Idiots is certainly worth a watch, but the latter makes you wish that you'd left the theatre in the intermission."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, three idiots is adopted from \"5 point someone\" novel by Chetan Bhagat and has been shot in IIM B'lore campus. I must admit that Mr. Hirani has come up with another good venture after Munna Bhai and its sequel.\n\n3 idiots illustrates the experiences of college life of 3 engineering friends. Unlike usual college comedies, this movie presents a fresh perspective with a message. Pre-interval part is totally hilarious and I can bet the comedy would roll you all in your seats. Just like MunnaBhai(s), Mr. Hirani has sought to bring forward a message through this movie. Therefore, though some instances post interval might appear out of line (must say a bit un-realistic) but viewers would like the overall movie.\n\nAamir, as one of the protagonist, has been phenomenal in this movie as a college going student. Sharman, Madhvan and Boman Irani have also made very good contributions in the movie. Kareena looks good but her role is limited. Direction is good and the movie is set in the backdrop of Delhi.\n\nIts certainly worth one time watch.\n\nHope you all enjoy this movie.\n\nRegards, MaDdyMacD"

        "review_detailed_main": "It's good in parts but Okay as a whole. Aamir Khan this time comes up as an engineering student and does it not so convincingly. He seemed to have been through college not once but many times over, as he started telling 'Say your heart All is Well and things will fall into place'.\n\nThe movie is about giving freedom to kids and a message to parents, let them be what they want to be do not enforce things on them. This is conveyed in a light sense and in a comical way. Yet, at times it becomes preachy, like the confrontation of Rancho with Virus where Rancho says 'Yeh Marks mere ko samajh aaye hi nahi' and yet not at many other times. It is a parody of itself take the black and white scenes of Raju's family or the scene of Chatur Lingam where he says that after 5 years lets see who will be where. But the good moments are far and only between as a few drizzles in a tropic summer.\n\nThe cinematography is good only in parts. Like aerial shots of Shimla road and Ladakh scenes otherwise it was just good. The art designing is commendable with the look of college, hostel and other things done well. The editing was not precise as I thought there are lot of things that could have been cut out like the pregnancy sequence in climax. The casting was not apt except Boman Irani as Principal, Chatur Lingam guy the others were clearly not apt. The 3 main protagonists and the heroine were clearly a misfit as none seemed to be students. Acting was average as nothing was so great and so original as if it was never seen. Chatur Lingam was the silver lightning in the otherwise dry acting. Also to mention is Boman Irani as principal.\n\nThe writing was mediocre as their previous ones were well written and witty Munnabhai movies. And this was an adaptation of Five Point Someone having read that, I can say that the whole backdrop and the characters and only a few situations were picked but the point that was told was different from the book. That book is much worse than this movie. I am not detailing any instances as mostly, I found them silly and stupid.\n\nAnd in parts, hardly a couple, the originality came out. The speech by Chatur Lingam is the saving grace otherwise it was merely pathetic but such instances took it to at least average level.\n\nAll is surely not well and it's strictly Average - 2/5."

        "review_detailed_main": "Three Idiots' is a remarkable ahead of its time Bollywood blockbuster. This film is a comedy movie with strong acting, memorable characters, a perplexing storyline and most importantly, highly motivational movie to choose the right path in your life.\n\nThe producers of the movie expressed some amazing scenery of the mountainous landscape of Ladakh. These scenes were taken with various different camera angles such as high angle, crane and parallax shots. These colourful scenes were ingeniously used to infer that a happy and exiting moment was to come. I felt as though the film was very educational in the way that it tries to spread awareness and teach the viewers of the increasing risk of the school system related suicides in India. The mood of this film changes rapidly from joyous to depressing to comedic etc. In doing so, it made the film more exiting as I was always at the edge of my seat unknowing what fascinating event will take place. I used to think all Bollywood films are low budget with atrocious actors, but now I realised how incredibly convincing some of their actors are, even for Hollywood standards! These acting capabilities I have witnessed set a great example to me of how extraordinary Bollywood films can be and it intrigues me to watch more.\n\nOverall, 'Three Idiots' was an amazing film that really impressed me of how good Bollywood films can be. My emotions throughout the film was like a roller coaster, going from sad to jubilant in a matter of seconds. I mainly recommend this film to anyone who is unsure of watching a Bollywood film, yet I also recommend this film to every other person in the entirety of the earth."

Starring Aamir Khan, R. Madhavan, Sharman Joshi, Kareena Kapoor, Boman Irani and Omi Vaidya, the film follows the friendship of three students at an Indian engineering college and is a satire about the social pressures under an Indian education system. The film is narrated through parallel dramas, one in the present and the other ten years in the past.\n\nProduced by Vidhu Vinod Chopra under the banner Vinod Chopra Films, the film incorporated real Indian inventions created by Remya Jose,Mohammad Idris, Jahangir Painter and Sonam Wangchuk.

Also this film likes to show many serious issues of the real world but then the next second it puts a terrible joke, so I could not take this film seriously at all. It's such a mess. It had many great ideas, the storyline is great, but it's just such a mess, it tries to mixes multiple genres at the same time which does not help."

A drama about a severe dads and their youngsters, exceptionally educational in the way, it looks to bring issues to light and teach watchers about the rising risk of suicides in educational system.\n\n3 idiots recount such a kinship , among 3 college mates Madhavan as Farhan, Sharman as Raju and Amir khan as Rancho. Two standard understudies who simply scratch through and the one tremendous impact in their lives expert understudy Rancho, the livewire of the threesome who disturb the Dean of Imperial College of Engineering when tested, every one of them seeking after the field of designing when the one in particular who appears to have an energy for the material is Rancho. Farhan was forced to become skilled in the field because of his strict father to become and Raju is pursuing the field with the goal of getting his family out of poverty, with his fathers expensive health bills, his mothers fragile core and his sisters failure to wed all on the table.\n\n3 idiots is a brilliant, priceless endeavor in the realm of movies. Its actors are perfectly fitting for their jobs, helped by a content so human and valid for life that it is really difficult to accept and caught through delightfully alive cinematography to all things considered give us an excellent bundle not simply in the non-literal sense.\n\nIt is a back rub to the guardians of youth and that is to quit applying strain to an all around worried segment. A thought that numerous youngsters are determined what to become in life early and are deterred from investigations or even close to home aspiration.\n\nThis is perhaps the best satire I have at any point seen. I will rate this 10/10 and would recommend it to everybody.\n\nThis is Khadija Urooj, enrolled in an undergraduate program at IPP Bahria University. Who loves to play badminton and table tennis, also loves to cook food. An introvert who does not like to share her thoughts but do it to suggest something."

Add to this, the strong emotional core of the film that makes gentle tugs, now and then, at your guts, and you have an almost perfect score. Hirani carries forward his simplistic 'humanism alone works' philosophy of the Lage Raho Munnabhai series in 3 Idiots too, making it a warm and vivacious signature tune to 2009. The second half of the film does falter in parts, specially the child birth sequence, but it doesn't take long for the film to jump back on track. Aamir does it again. what a movie .from start to the end, hilarious moments.screenplay is fantastic. full on comedy and yet it never looses its heart. pulls off a 22 year old character with brilliance. never for once you feel you are watching. music looks OK"

People are in fact like chatur.. Not all.. But at least 99% of them.. Who just go to college on the basis of the placements.... Everyone aspires for a settled future like Chatur Ramalingam...

        "review_detailed_main": "3 Idiots is a comedy and inspirational film directed by Rajkumar Hirani. This film is based on our Indian educational system which pressurizes the students and has an obsession for high grades. Aamir Khan as Rancho plays the role of a very bright student who motivates his friends pursue their passion and make a career out of it. R. Madhavan as Farhan who wants to become a wildlife photographer but was forced to pursue engineering because of his strict father.\n\nSharman Joshi as Raju who is pursuing engineering with the goal of getting his family out of extreme poverty. Boman Irani as virus who plays the role of a strict college director who is highly competitive. Kareena Kapoor as Pia who plays the role of virus's daughter and falls in love with Aamir khan. The film goes very smooth. The film's first half includes ragging scene, confrontations with the professor, Chatur's speech and mournful meal at Raju's home. Overall the film depicts a very nice mingle of comedy, suspense and motivational. All the actors and co-actors done a commendable job. The music of the film was very soothing. Some of the scenes are really emotional. Overall rating is excellent."

However, that time passes by quickly, filled by a series of \"mini\" movies contributing to the overarching storyline of this film. But that's all beside the point.\n\nI went into this movie having not seen much Bollywood before, and thinking this was a twist on the 3 stooges. Boy was I in for a rollercoaster. I could tackle this movie as I usually do, dialogue, cinematography, set design, acting, and quality. If I did that, however, this movie would have a much lower rating. If I based my score off of how many people peed on a wall though... I want to acknowledge that this movie is old, many of the cuts and transitions are cheesy to the western world, most storylines were just there for the surprise, and some of the dialogue... \"not it chief.\"\n\nBut,\n\nthat's not this movie. If you go in expecting Christopher Nolan you will surely leave disappointed. What makes this movie worth watching in my opinion, are the heavy topics, themes, that it covers in a comedic yet straightforward, not pulling punches, way. I don't want to give any spoilers but to name a view of the themes, the robotic flawed nature of the educational system, the issue of suicide caused by stress, parents pushing their dreams on their children, and pursuing things that make you happy. Just by that alone, Woah, this movie is gold. And the comedy, it's fun, keeps it a very enjoyable watch!\n\nMajor props to the Indian filmmaking culture for making this gem.\n\n\"All is well!\""

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie starts of well with excellent wit and moves along a pretty good pace that sets up the rest of the movie. 3 Idiots is all about 3 friends \u2013 Rancho, Raju and Farhan (Aamir Khan, Sharman Joshi and R Madhavan respectively) who have been accepted into a prestigious institute and set about to pursue their dreams.\n\nThe three lead actors share excellent chemistry, along with the authoritarian principal Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani) and the ever competing bookworm Chatur Ramalingam (portrayed by Omi Vaidya) in an excellent role that gives life to the movie. The humor is pretty good in the movie. And the way the director has managed to intertwine both comedy and sentiments subtly is applaudable.\n\nGoing to the negative aspects, I felt that some of the humor has been taken up shrewdly from the internet, the scenes which include Rancho pawning the campus director after his speech about his acclaimed astronaut pen, and then there's the scene where Rancho mixes up their exam papers among the pile of papers of other students. These jokes have been doing rounds on the internet for years now.\n\nThen there's the need to insert a love story into the movie in the most conventional way possible. The usual bollywood type love story, the girl (Pia played by Kareena Kapoor) doesn't like the guy at first. And then the hero manages to weave magic (Chamatkaar or Balatkaar, choose for yourself) around her which leaves her intoxicated enough to fall for our irresistible Rancho.\n\nHirani also manages to push the limits a li'l far with some scenes, there is a scene wherein Rancho tries to extract a baby using a vacuum cleaner which he manages to assemble all and well within a few mins when our woman is in deep pain (literally), and then there is the succeeding scene where the baby isn't breathing. However, it comes to life when everyone starts chanting the tagline 'Aal izz well'\u0085 (really???) The rest of the movie is well done which still makes it a full paisa vasool movie despite the flaws. Well written and most importantly surpassed by better acting by the actors who make up the movie. It would have been awesome if the the writer had managed to come up with some more original ideas. But still 3 idiots is one of the better Hindi cinemas this year. This is definitely not Hirani's best work, but one of the better one's indeed!!! There will always be talk about how movies aren't supposed to be taken too seriously, which is absolutely true. But in the end, its the feeling that you walk out with, that will define your contentment. If you read this review, you will find most of it is filled with negative aspects. The reason being, the rest of the movie is truly excellent, laced with sentiment and humor, which is a definite watch. Watch it!!"

This film is a comedy movie with strong acting, memorable characters, a perplexing storyline and most importantly, highly motivational movie to choose the right path in your life.\n\nThe producers of the movie expressed some amazing scenery of the mountainous landscape of Ladakh. These scenes were taken with various different camera angles such as high angle, crane and parallax shots. These colourful scenes were ingeniously used to infer that a happy and exiting moment was to come. I felt as though the film was very educational in the way that it tries to spread awareness and teach the viewers of the increasing risk of the school system related suicides in India. The mood of this film changes rapidly from joyous to depressing to comedic etc. In doing so, it made the film more exiting as I was always at the edge of my seat unknowing what fascinating event will take place. I used to think all Bollywood films are low budget with atrocious actors, but now I realised how incredibly convincing some of their actors are, even for Hollywood standards! These acting capabilities I have witnessed set a great example to me of how extraordinary Bollywood films can be and it intrigues me to watch more.\n\nOverall, 'Three Idiots' was an amazing film that really impressed me of how good Bollywood films can be. My emotions throughout the film was like a roller coaster, going from sad to jubilant in a matter of seconds. I mainly recommend this film to anyone who is unsure of watching a Bollywood film, yet I also recommend this film to every other person in the entirety of the earth."

It also happens to be the most commercially successful Bollywood feature ever released in India. Go figure.\n\nThe story centers around a trio of promising but mischievous young engineering students who rebel against the high-pressured rigidity - both academic and personal - of the exclusive school they're attending.\n\n\"3 Idiots\" has two things going for it: its cranked-up energy level and its appealing actors, especially Aamir Khan, who portrays the ringleader of the group. These alone are enough to compensate for the silliness of much of the action, the corniness of the jokes (with irritating cue music in case we couldn't pick up on the corn on our own) and the stickiness of the sentimentality. And, in its own playful way, the movie makes some important points about the intense pressure placed on Indian children to achieve beyond their parents' wildest expectations, and about the need to pursue the path that will make one most happy in life.\n\nIt's a pretty entertaining feature, overall; I just wish it didn't take so darn long to play itself out."

I am not quite sure how it got 8.1..The most ridiculous part was the delivery of a baby using a vacuum cleaner, common people who are watching not dumb, can they point out a single instance. That scene almost ruined the movie. Overall, it is just an outright commercial movie for the youth and the masses, nothing fantastic."

It is so colourful and beautifully filmed, the storytelling is really captivating and unusual. I loved the musical bits here and there. The characters are lovable and hilarious (Rancho, The professor at ICE, Silencer). The cliches somehow seem fresh (escaping the wedding with the bride).

        "review_detailed_main": "TThree Idiots' is a remarkable ahead of its time Bollywood blockbuster. This film is a comedy movie with strong acting, memorable characters, a perplexing storyline and most importantly, highly motivational movie to choose the right path in your life.\n\nThe producers of the movie expressed some amazing scenery of the mountainous landscape of Ladakh. These scenes were taken with various different camera angles such as high angle, crane and parallax shots. These colourful scenes were ingeniously used to infer that a happy and exiting moment was to come. I felt as though the film was very educational in the way that it tries to spread awareness and teach the viewers of the increasing risk of the school system related suicides in India. The mood of this film changes rapidly from joyous to depressing to comedic etc. In doing so, it made the film more exiting as I was always at the edge of my seat unknowing what fascinating event will take place. I used to think all Bollywood films are low budget with atrocious actors, but now I realised how incredibly convincing some of their actors are, even for Hollywood standards! These acting capabilities I have witnessed set a great example to me of how extraordinary Bollywood films can be and it intrigues me to watch more.\n\nOverall, 'Three Idiots' was an amazing film that really impressed me of how good Bollywood films can be. My emotions throughout the film was like a roller coaster, going from sad to jubilant in a matter of seconds. I mainly recommend this film to anyone who is unsure of watching a Bollywood film, yet I also recommend this film to every other person in the entirety of the earth."

The length at almost 3 hours is way too long for a movie of this sort. And the hero, is well kind of a jerk not a loveable rebel (a quality I usually love to see). And there is way too much predictability in the plot. I dont watch very much Indian cinema, my favorite Indian flick is monsoon wedding, now that was a great film. This was mediocre on a good day."

I hate art-sy movies that depend their own existence on some hidden fundamental meaning of how human existence is badly guided and the directors (artists know nothing about sociology, as much as they want to think otherwise) simply hand out the answers in a silver plate.\n\nThe main character seems like the run-of-the-mill politically correct guy that thinks \"being yourself\" is one of the best pieces of advice you could ever grant someone with. As the movie flows his complete lack of respect for authority gets more coherent with what he preaches.\n\nBasically you have a few students that are graduating in engineering while having to cope with an extremely perfectionist professor. While the protagonist believes that the imagination of the students is as much an education problem as studying hours upon hours immersed in technical books. Their world views collide when Poncho, the main guy, falls in love with the professor's daughter.\n\nThis is a funny movie while maintaining a strong message of not having to choose a high-pay job to be successful. Contradictions are bound to arrive, like family problems and old ways that always seem to die hard.\n\nJust forget that the film is desperately trying to output some kind of universal happiness through doing whatever you feel like doing in your life, getting ever closer to a modern day fairy-tale than the cheesy foreign comedy."

        "review_detailed_main": "The actual scene of college education in India has now been exposed to the world. Pressures related to studies leading to wrong paths taken by people or suicides have been the major portion of the plot.\n\nThe movie starts with the entry of 3 young students to the ICE (best engineering institute of the country ). The starting scene of the movie clearly points out the topic that is competition is so tough in India that students , instead of improving themselves , only look to getting good grades and even mug up for 18 hours a day for the achievement. Finally , what the director conveys through the movie is that one who wants to study will study by any means and not look to better grades but improving himself and he will finally turn out to be the ultimate winner.\n\nACTING ---- Everybody is excellent, just the way the movie demanded. Aamir Khan , as always, weaves magic playing an 18 year old though he himself is 44. Madhavan, Sharman Joshi, and Kareena Kapoor complemented extremely well by playing their parts. Boman Irani does a typical Engineering Institute Director mastering every bit of his part. Omi Vaidya was excellent in his role especially his dialogue delivery. He is one new actor in Bollywood with some hopes in acting.\n\nDIRECTION --- Good direction as what is expected by Raj Kumar Hirani but way too many flaws, the major flaws being :\n\nCalling Mona Singh's character Poonam in the first half and Mona in the second half. Also, when you steal from someone's office , you do not use their land-line to call someone -- A major flaw.\n\nSince it was a feel good movie, we can ignore scenes like the baby kicking when he listens to AAL IZZ WELL. On the whole , a good attempt on the topic , could have been better as what is expected by Aamir Khan. For me its a 7/10.\n\nIn the end, i would love to repeat an excellent quote from the movie :\n\n\" Strive for Excellence and Success will follow \""

How Rancho influences the other 2 characters realize their dream and also find love on the way form the crux of the story. There are several other notable characters like the college professor and Rancho's academic rival who sometimes seem like caricatures but provide large amount of laughter.\n\nThe movie deals with sensitive topic like Education system and pressure on students to succeed in a satirical and comical kind of way. It is more relatable to Asian culture where education system is flawed and academic excellence is all what parents strive for. The message conveyed through the movie is excellent and strikes an emotional connect with audience who have gone through similar ordeals in their college life."

        "review_detailed_main": "3 Idiots is Rajkumar Hirani's latest offering after his previous socially-relevant Munnabhai series films. This time, he doesn't have Sanjay Dutt and Arshad Warsi. So, this time we have Aamir Khan, Sharman Joshi and R. Madhavan playing college students. The hype is tremendous. But what about the movie? Our heroes enter a top engineering college with shining eyes full of dreams, and hopes for a better future. Life gives them a reality check in the shape of Viru Sahastrabuddhe, their dominating principal who believes that life is a race, and that is the only way it has to be lived. Rancho, (Aamir Khan, looking surprisingly youthful, but still older than an engineering student) keeps motivating his friends to learn rather than mug the subjects. While most people refuse to take the path less traveled, Rancho continues to excel on this path, and even beat those who take the conventional track. The frequent run-ins with the Principal, what happens to the friends in college is what forms the crux of the story.\n\nLoosely based on Five Point Someone, the story has been reworked and actually improved upon; but the screenplay loses some of the Raju Hirani charm. To make things understood in simple terms, he sometimes takes the help of measures that are not only over the top, but sometimes unbelievable. Why a principal would not rusticate a student after so many insubordinations and misdemeanors is beyond measure. The delivery scene looks incredulous as well. Some things can be termed cinematic liberties, but others leave you confused.\n\nRaju Hirani the director is in top form again. His affection for socially-relevant comedies sees him unveiling a new phrase 'All eez well' to follow in the footsteps of 'Jaadu ki jhappi' and 'Gandhigiri'. In my opinion, 'Lage Raho Munnabhai' was his best effort to date, and even though he doesn't reach those peaks with Idiots, it is very good work indeed. He is the star of the show.\n\nAamir Khan as Rancho does extremely well, considering he is the most out of age in this movie. With constantly widened eyes and loose clothes, he gets into the skin of the tireless learner-cum-inventor. Though things he does look incredulous, he mostly makes them feel real. Sharman Joshi and Madhavan as his friends who are on the rote path only to be 'enlightened' by Khan are competent. Joshi is especially good in the principal's office scene. Kareena Kapoor is good in a brief, albeit important role. The real scene-stealer though, has to be Omi Vaidya. The actor steals the show as the stereotypical opposite of Rancho, Chatur. Note his expressions in the speech scene. Hilarious! Boman Irani as the principal is good, but the unnecessary lisp in his voice could have been avoided.\n\nShantanu Moitra's compositions are situational and complement the narration. Zoobi Doobi sticks out like a sore thumb though, and seems more like an item song. Jaane Nahi Denge Tujhe tides over a tough period in the story, while Behti Hawa serves as an excellent introduction. The background score serves its purpose.\n\nBinod Pradhan's cinematography is commendable. I spent half an hour dissecting the introduction scene with a friend and we still could not figure out how it was done. The set design is good. The special effects, though minimal, are well executed.\n\nFinal Verdict: With 3 idiots, Raju Hirani stays in the Munnabhai franchise, albeit with different actors. The story has its heart in the right place, but the execution is far from perfect. Still, I'm going with 3.5 out of 5 for this look at the education system."

This film inspired by Chethan Bhagat's 5-Point Someone is awesome.. I loved each moment of this film.. Kareena Kapoor in Zoobi Doobi song in the red sari was really hot.. In all other scenes she was very cute..She should definitely do deglam roles like these coz she really looks good.. Speaking of looks, Aamir takes the cake as a 20yr old student.. He is 44yrs man!! I really loved him.. Each scene is gold, directed by Raju Hirani.. Really long film-2hrs 45min, but doesn't feel that way!!"

He shows us that both can be possible in a single movie. A movie like HeraPheri was a wonderful comedy while Swadesh was giving a real life preaching message but blending both genre of movie and come up with such a masterpiece is amazing. Fantastic screen play with crisp dialogs and ultimate cast selection made this as one of my all time best.\n\nAnd what to say about Amir Khan? He surpasses my expectation level one more time. DCH, RDB, TZP and now this one!! He is such a refreshing feeling in movie that you can't come out of, ever after two days. This is the youngest he is looking in last fifteen years. If I was too surprised with young and charming Brad Pitt in Curious case of Benjamin Button, then Amir on top of that added mischievous of youth too. Look at his curious eyes, his ever swinging body, his quick repartees.. ooh boy he is incomparable.\n\nBest part of movie is that, even with such a powerful casting, I was so much engrossed with Rancho, Farhan, Hari, Pia, Virus, Chatur that no one not even Amir was able to overshadow movie. Boman Irani, Madhavan, Sharman, Kareena all played their part superbly. This new guy Mr Chatur also did a great comedy performance and reason for lots of hilarious moment in movie.\n\nAll in all it was a complete entertainment package. I am giving only 9 out of 10 and saving last one; because I am sure Mr Hirani and Amir will surpass their own record soon."

Seeing as how India makes twice as many movies as us (we're still at least in the Top 3 though), it really is something most people should watch. The basic story is that these two students are going on a road trip to find their friend, Rancho. As a three hour long comedy, it knows how to use its time. Of course, this can be said for most Bollywood films. For whatever reason, the version I saw occasionally had English in it.\n\nWhat's great about this movie is that so much is going on and they know how to experiment with so many different genres. We get great comedy, drama, and romance. You could even argue it gets scary near the end. It's a plot that goes everywhere and you're having fun every minute of the day. It's one of those movies where you have to pay close attention. Nearly every joke is alluded to or referenced again in the story.\n\nMaybe it can focus too much on drama, but working in different genres is always impressive. We even get some great lessons learned about serving our parents and how important college degrees can be. It helps that it's so much fun and we're glad to see standard Bollywood dance numbers. It's quite bright and colorful. I love the bits with the pencils in space too. Glad to know this has enough votes to be on the Top 250. ****"

I FINALLY finished watching it.\n\nIt got me one and half week to actually finish watching this highly overwritten, over acted, Uber-sentimental, highly predictable, over produced tear-jerker, not funny \"good feel\" / \"comedy\". The only reason why i even started to watching it was its high position in IMDb Top 250 movies. WHAT is this thing even doing in IMDb Top 250? This year i saw bunch of movies better by many, many, many (and did i said MANY?) moons and oceans then this... \"stuff\". To be honest, i think i know exactly what is this flick doing in IMDb Top 250 - but i will keep my opinion just to not offend anyone. Can't remember last time i had my eyes rolling like every 5-10 min during the whole \"experience\".\n\nThat said, i don't watch Bollywood movies, this is my probably first one, so maybe here lies the reason why i didn't like it at all. Everything is just so \"offbeat\" - and not in a good way. Music is so over written and over used, comedy timing isn't good, although it got me couple of times smiling, this is not a funny movie, well unless... again, i will keep my opinion by myself.\n\nOverall, if you are like 10 years old and do like Bollywood movies, you will probably love it, but anyone else beyond that age or those who don't like movie production from that country - stay away, far away from this flick. And one more thing - i kinda doing marathon of movies from IMDb Top 250, and at the moment i saw like ~203 of them and was intended to see them all. Until this moment there wasn't a poor movie to say the least, and lowest score i gave in the past from any movie from IMDb Top 250 was 8. \"3 Idiots\" is the worst from anything i saw yet, and to think that there are more Bollywood production inside of this great list keeps my head spinning - i don't think i will be able to \"experience\" such a movie again, although i still considering to do the list... God have mercy."

But time to think the Rajkumar Hirani & Bidhu Binod Chopra duo is also the same. This is their 3rd consecutive wonder, first without Munnabhai. I must say their movies remind me of the works of Hrishikesh Mukherjee, simplicity is their similarity.\n\nEvery scene was so complete & flawless, one would agree that they didn't left any field related to the scene unresearch. The mix of comedy and emotion with reality was awesome. The characters never looked like superstars; but they were so prominent, so natural, their acts were so funny but realistic. Boman, Sarman, Madhaban thumps up to them. Omi Vaidya (silencer) will be a memorable character.\n\nThe movie is around 3 hours long, but not lengthy at all. The story the twists the humors will entertain you and touch your heart and will keep your patience till the end. Finally a good ending in a beautiful landscape did justice to the film.\n\nRating: Planning to go on Sunday again."

That's why they have so easily been able to portray what this movie is all about \"... chase excellence and success will be a byproduct..\".\n\nMusic of Aamir movies has always been situational and generally doesn't pick up unil one sees the movie. That's true even for this one too and \"All Izz Well\" will certainly going to play new tag lines for youth since they last changed \"Chak De\".\n\nMovie tries to cover a lot of issues plagueing our higher education system especially in context of Middle class aspirations. Engineering and Medicine are like religion. Although idealism shown in favor of innovation and out-of-box thinking is certainly need of the hour.\n\nBoman Irani may be getting typed in \"Director/Professor\" cast; but then you always feel like a breath of fresh air whenever he is on screen. Sharman joshi had done good justice to his role. Madhvan could have done more justice to his role, but i feel his passion for photography was not aptly portrayed either; in order to have a convincing concluding scene. It was great to see Parkshit Sahni after so much time and a couple of dialogues from Sharman's mother were excellent; especially \"Pizza ki 30 minute delivery ki guarantee hai, par ambulance 2 ghante mein bhi nahin aati\".\n\nAamir has proved it again that till the time he is around, intelligent cinema will be around."

Its a hilarious movie, laugh-out-loud funny, and some scenes leave the tummy hurting. There's enough zing for mainstream cinema - which probably explains its amazing business in a couple of weeks of release. While Aamir is fantastic and totally believable as an engineering student (Defying his real age) and everything else about the movie is great, it's the attention to detail that got me hooked enough to decide giving it a second viewing. The plot is reasonably well thought out while originally \"adapted\" from Chetan's book. There are a lot of great things going for the movie - but i was sort of surprised to not see Chetan Bhagat's name anywhere on the credits. After getting out of the screening, got online to figure out what the deal was - and got wind of the huge controversy brewing. As nice a movie as this adaptation is - it is still an adaptation, and having seen the movie, and given the book a second read to get my facts right - i can honestly state that a lot more than half the movie is a lift from the book, so the claim that the screenplay is original does take something away from the whole experience (The film makers claim that the end rolling credits have Chetan Bhagat's name is pretty funny - because frankly, how many stick around to watch the rolling credits!?) Note: I am in no way related to or have any affiliations with Chetan Bhagat. This is just my opinion after having read the book, and watched the movie - to make sense of the lack of credit where its due."

Some of the basic concepts which could have been seen, heard or experienced is well displayed on the scree! Of course, needless to say,that Boman Irani on his College director role still rocks and reminds of his well handled character in Mumnnabhai MBBS. The friendship, the college life, the fights everything which we see common in life and the fun that's been played is really awesome! The story is based on Chetan Bhagat's novel and is well picturised. I think this should be one of the most successful and award winning movie of 2009 and is released in India on a very auspicious occasion of Christmas! I recommend everyone to go and watch this movie! This is movie worth watching in Cinema halls rather than seating at home! And also do not forget to watch with your best friends! The feeling would be really fantabulous!!!!"

Movie revolves around Ranchordas(Amir Khan) and his two friends Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan) and Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi).Ranchordas(Amir Khan)as a Engineering Student denied to bound by traditional teaching practices and tried to convey,teaching is at it's best when it is served with simplicity and fun. Boman Irani as Professor Viru Sahastrabudhhe (ViruS) was the only piece in the movie who achieved it's purpose and he was so factual that he could make you, to thank God, to not to cast you in his class-room. Film editor has made a wonderful job to montage all sequences in a self-explainory manner and it was non other but Rajkumar only. Like Amir Khan's other movies he looked here stiffed too, he has failed make any appeal to audience but still his quick clear with perfectly synchronized mover made this movies alive and he had perfect timing for humor punches too. Cinematography is not the thing for director as observed from \"munna bhai MBBS\" and \"Lage raho munna bhai\" but his movies are justified as soon as these are kept in commercial cinema. All I personally liked in this movie was it's script which is soul of the movie but when conspiracy evolved from the all time best seller writer Chetan Bhagat for the story plot nothing was left in the movie. When you personally read his famous book Five Point someone you will also have the sympathy for him. Overall for a film critic there is nothing wonderful to write about but still is a enjoyable movie and in the country like India where dream sells, commercial movie flies"

After the enormous success of Munnabhai series, he takes another chance and delivers, and surely he delivers well, winning the heart of his audience again. He's definitely the \"Undisputed King of Comedy\"..\n\nShortly following him is our Rancchoddas Shyamaldas Chanchad. No Spoilers please. Yes, I will follow the advice and proceed.\n\nMusic is not extraordinary but it fits the movie and situation perfectly to the limit that you may even start enjoying it.\n\nPlot, loosely based on Chetan Bhagat's 5 point someone which I have not read and I do not really intend to read. For me as a viewer, it's Hirani's and Abjhijat's Joshi's screenplay that made me enjoy the movie and I would like to keep it that way.\n\nI don't enjoy bollywood cinema a lot. 10% of movies which gain commercial success and amidst all the hype can be 'in real terms' can be said good, one of this kind is 3 Idiots.\n\nYou will enjoy 170 minutes of this movie that I can assure you. And 70% of the time, you'll be laughing. If you enjoyed Munnabhai's humor, this movie is definitely your cuppa coffee.\n\nDon't miss it but if you've got small kids, enjoy the movie at home. Yes I'm venting out my frustration at this point. And I'm sure I'm not alone in this.\n\nI give this movie a 8.

While none of the characters are portrayed as gay, the numerous references made to the male buttocks are enough to make one take note. It is referred to as a \"gift that is being requested for acceptance\" at the new students initiation ceremony, with many of the new students strutting and gyrating in just their underwear, including a scene with an underwear pulled down slightly to reveal a side of the buttock, with a stamp of approval on it, like it was certified A+ grade meat, or beef (gay male). In addition the name of the hero (Amir Khan) in the movie is too long to say at the initiation, and is considered to be \"quite a mouthful\". There is another scene in a song where all three lead actors are seated with their backs to the camera, on seats that have the shape of male buttocks, and then turn around while seated in them and rub the buttock shaped seats with their hands while smiling suggestively. There is also a song where the students are taking baths but that could be considered to be as communal shower although with the shorts covered with loin cloths. Other scenes include pants dropped to the ankles from time to time, with some scenes also involving turning of the person to the camera and whacking it to be accepted in defeat with the pants down. It might be overlooked as being funny, but these scenes are heavy in gay overtones. Otherwise just another Indian movie with a strong message of friendship."

I think most people rating it so high must have seen it just once, if you give it more than one viewing you will start to see the flaws.\n\nThe movie is just average in my opinion as the story is predictable, most of the jokes are copied and even the social message in the movie is quite broad.\n\nI will say this the movie is definitely worth watching and is a feel good movie but does not deserve to be up there with the best movies ever made."

        "review_detailed_main": "Before I start heaping praise for the movie, let me point out to a few,very few average points of the film.\n\nThe movie at several points turned too obvious , so obvious that I bet half the audience in the theatre could guess what was coming next . I don't imply the director always has to pull out a rabbit out of the hat or do the unobvious ,but I strongly feel not letting the audience see through the curtain is the best way to keep them glued to their seats . Also I feel there was a bit of Munnabhai hangover casting its shadow on the direction of the movie.There seems to be a certain monotonicity in the three films Hirani has to his name, but this is still pardonable.I would have to say a few scenes like \"the Baby Delivery scene\" were a bit off the hook .. nevertheless the audience loved it.\n\nWell enough of biting now let me write something good , very good about the movie .\n\nRajkumar Hirani Take a Bow !!!! You did it once again you gem of an artist ,you in fact ended up bettering the Novel.The most beautiful aspect of his direction here is the perfect blend of portrayal of Humour and Emotions he achieved. One moment you are fighting hard to keep those pearls grilled in your eyes and the other you actually spill them out laughing . The movie comes up with a beautiful message , I mean what more can the audience ask for ? Another very beautiful aspect of his direction was the ease with which he geared in & out of present and flashback.The screenplay of the movie (which is a combined effort of Hirani ,Bhagat and Joshi(Mission Kashmir & Lage Raho Munnabhai Fame) ) is top notch. The music by Shantanu Moitra though might not appear to have hit the bull's eye initially but goes very well with the Movie.Watch out for the track \" Gimme Some Sunshine \".\n\nSharman Joshi was just the perfect cast in the role of Raju and did complete justice to the role, but as one of my friends pointed out the character resembled the character of Sukhi from RDB. But still here is one guy who has a perfect timing for comedy and still shoulders emotional scenes with similar ease.The duration of role Kareena got might not be long but the character leaves her effect well.Madhavan too does complete justice to the role. Boman Irani is one of those people who just doesn't stop getting praises every time enters the screen , he does a marvellous job portraying Virus, The Director. In the end I must admit this movie belongs to Aamir Khan. Hats of to you sir!!! May be its his Incapability to do bad that always works for him . Not a moment in the whole movie would you feel that here is a 44 year old man playing a 21 year old boy..... and has looked younger than ever . I bet he would have made the odd 30's and 40's feel like being 20 again ... No doubt he in response to Shahrukh's King status Claims to be the Ekka (Ace) of Bollywood.\n\nTime for rating , As a critic I'd rate it 4/5 , as i thought the editing could have been better , and for the few momentary lapses here and there in the direction .\n\nBut as a viewer who wants entertainment I'd rate it a 4.5/5 . Amazing movie , go watch it , you'll laugh , you'll cry and will in the end, end up walking out of the theatre with a message. A Must watch for every age group :)"

Screenplay, Acting is superb. Aamir Khan is as usual brilliant but we also see noticeable performance from Madhvan, Sharman Joshi and Kareena Kappor. The person who has impressed me most is Boman Irani. He had been brilliant in this movie. Definitely worth a watch. Giving it 9 out of 10 only because Rang De Basanti was better than this."

Some characters are so over the top as to be almost Keystone Koppish, and others very genuine, and still others, rather inconsistent.

        "review_title": "An American POV: Very good movie, but longer than needs to be",
        "review_detailed_main": "First off, take note of the length of the movie (IMDb here says 170 minutes). You got that right, just shy of 3 hours. But don't let that scare you from watching the movie - it is a really emotional movie which will grip you for the full 3 hours.\n\nSecond, it probably does not need to be 3 hours. I hear there is an American remake in the works. I am anxious to see how it will be done, and what will be cut because there is a lot of stuff in this movie which probably can get the boot. We Americans generally believe that all Indian movies have dance numbers, and this movie doesn't disappoint, with several useless numbers (useless in my opinion).\n\nThird, the IMDb synopsis, while accurate, refers to like...one quarter of the actual movie. In other words, it is a lot like \"Forest Gump\" in that the \"present\" that is initially presented (which involves Forest finding Jenny and his son, and then moving to Alabama, etc. etc.) is setup through the telling of the whole back story, which takes up the majority. Same deal here with \"3 Idiots\". The IMDb synopsis covers the present, in that three guys are on a journey to find their lost friend, but the real meat of this movie is the whole back story which is not mentioned in the least. So just keep that in mind before starting the movie. I say that because when I read the synopsis I came in with this mentality that this was going to be an Indian version of \"Road Trip\" or something, just based on the title, the cover and the synopsis (it really isn't).\n\nFourth, this movie is nothing like your vulgar/sexual American comedies involving some good buddies and their adventures. There really are some useful messages in this movie, especially some that will really touch home with anyone who has gone through engineering studies (like myself).\n\nWith that aside, the movie was great. The emotions are really powerful, the acting is really good - a very touching story. The dean (Viru Sahastrabudhhe, played by Boman Irani) really touched home with me. I had a teacher exactly (Yes, EXACTLY!) like this guy in my engineering studies. Thankfully for me he was just a teacher of a couple classes and not the dean of the school (whew!).\n\nThe three hours really flies by because the advancements in the \"present\" story (the three guys on the journey to find their friend) are made after finding out the back story. For example, the movie starts out with a guy feigning a heart ailment to get a plane to turn home, rushing to a friend's house, waking him and rushing his good buddy out of his house (so fast that he forgets to put on his pants) all to arrive at this random location where they meet the third buddy. The third buddy tells them that they all made a promise to meet there 10 years prior. The next (very long) segment of the movie goes back to square zero to introduce everyone and educate (pun intended) as to the significance of the location. After that, the \"present\" advances to the next location. In my opinion, if the movie just focused on the \"present\" without giving any life to the characters, it would be very hollow. I mean just think if \"Forest Gump\" just started with him talking to that lady who tells him that Jenny's address is around the corner and he just runs off - you would never learn of Jenny's issues, Forest's history with Jenny, etc.\n\nMy only complaint is that the movie is just too damn long, and there are things that probably don't need to be elaborated multiple times. I get it, Rancho is different from everyone else, and will excel at everything. I don't need it to be reiterated 10 times. I also don't need the dance numbers, they provided nothing to the story. If you have seen the movie \"Men of Honor\" I think you can understand of what I speak (Cuba Gooding's character keeps pushing through the barriers to achieve his successes over and over to the point where the movie is longer than it needs to be. OK, he beat the racist general. OK he beat everyone else in their times underwater. OK he beat the racist who cut his tool bag. OK OK OK OK...heh).\n\nAll that aside, it has some really powerful messages that you can really take home as a future (or current) parent. I'd say that if you are current or prospective engineering student, this is a *MUST* watch. No joke. For graduates of engineering studies, I'd say you should definitely check this out to get a few chuckles, reminiscing about your days in engineering and to gather an idea of the Indian culture with engineering (if what they portray is true, I'd say it is eye-opening).\n\nIf it was more to the point, and not as dragged out, I'd give it a 9 or a 10."

There were instances when I couldn't control myself from rocking back and forth on the creaking sliding chair in the theatre and other instances when my eyes truly welled up.\n\nAamir Khan stuns as usual and is given great support from Omi Vaidya in the comedy role. Madhavan plays a good supporting role, as does the villain ViruS (can't remember his name).\n\nI would definitely go and watch this movie at least another 2 times if Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakuel wasn't opening in theatres on the 20th here!"

I decided to give it a chance and I was surprised at how much I liked this film. It certainly helps that it's also a comedy. I have some small issues with the film and I did feel it could do a lot better, but it didn't prevent me from laughing and crying throughout the movie. What I liked the most about this movie is that it's not like those other \"message movies\". There are times when it does get a bit melodramatic and times when the humor comes off as forced. But when the movie is funny, it's really funny and it's easy to root for the titular 3 idiots. It doesn't play like an infomercial on the education system; it plays off like an experience, as a good movie should.\n\nI like to think the movie is a lot like its main character: fun, good-natured and, as Rancho would say, never leaves its students behind. All in all, it is a tad bit overrated, but it's a charming movie with a relevant message. People who don't like how the message was presented should just realize that it was presented so that the masses can relate and, in turn, get something from it.\n\nAll is well. All is well. 8/10"

Aamir's introduction itself is a great start. I'll go on and say another lovely scene is when Farhan and Raju come last and find out where Rancho placed.\n\nR.

One of the Idiot is actually a Genius, And he was not able to adjust with formal and usual education system rather he prefer to learn from around the world.\n\nThe Movie slaps our Education system, this movie raises many questions which are reasonable. The Movie is a look back to our own College life. You will feel that you want to be in the college again, one more time or else you wish, at least the movie should have released when you were in College. You will enjoy with the 3 Idiots, cry with them and and will laugh with them. You will enjoy every moment of the movie. Its a blessing to have friends like that and a look back to our own Happy Days. The film starts from 'Good' and Ends at 'Superb'. Rajkumar Hirani, yes he did it again. and This is a Movie every Student and parents should see before going to a School.\n\nAamir Khan is out there and shines bright. Yet again, he had come up with very impressive performance and the film shows his Dedication. Madhavan - Very Convincing and have good Screen space where he did well with his natural Comic One Liner so as Sharmaan Joshi. Kareena Kapoor is beautiful and very good in a Girl with small brain.\n\nNegatives: Yes the movies has many, though not as many as pluses. The Delivery scene was too much to accept and adjust. - Only unwanted scene in the movie. And in Direction / Screenplay point of view, This time Director had compromised a lot more than he does for Munnabhai Series. Comedy is very enjoyable but looses reality in few scenes and the Most laughable scene (Chatur's Hindi Speech) is more like a Comic and little lengthy. And Have you ever heard or seen a Dean of the College coming in a Cycle?@, that too 'A College which ranks the Highest for Higher Studies' as mentioned in the movie.\n\nAt the End - the Movie is very Entertaining and can be rated as the most enjoyable Hindi movie of the Decade or 2 Decades or can increase few more."

        "review_detailed_main": "I just found out that Aamir Khan has played in every indian film I have reviewed this far! Wow, he must be super famous in India and stuff.\n\nAnyway, 3 Idiots is an Indian comedy/drama, and it has two plots - the main one, which is told through flashbacks, is about 3 guys that learn together engineering, and their fight against the pressure-inducing, toxic system. The outer plot follows two of these guys as they drive to meet the third guy, years after graduation - since then, he just disappeared. So yeah, that's the best way to sum it up, I think.\n\nThis film has so much stuff going on (3 hours, yeah, every Indian film that I've seen 'til now is super long), to a point that it makes me think that it could work as a mini-series, too. But, anyway, I wouldn't say that this film is boring - the plot has a fine pacing, most of the things going on are at least mildly entertaining. I do think that the ideas behind the film are mostly good and well-intended, so, it has pretty decent (though not that special) messages - be who you are, follow your dreams, pressure may lead to mental issues and stuff like that.\n\nProblems I had with this film: It's kinda cringy in a lot of points. Yeah. Whether it's because of the dialogue, or because of a corny way that the movie chose to communicate an idea through, it just turns out to be cringy in a lot of points.\n\nAlso, the music - why are so many songs here mixed in such a bad way? I mean...*sigh*. I know that the songs are not the main focus of the film, but they're there and at times they're quite redundant or irritating. (I'm talking about the music, the visuals are mostly cute) The humor on this film wasn't that great imo as well, and yeah, it can get corny too from time to time, but it's not horrible or anything. Just not my cup of tea, I guess. It's okay most of the time.\n\nSo, this film is...fine, I guess? It's overall enjoyable, tho it has a lot of corny moments and it never really blew my mind or anything, and a lot of plotlines were extremely predictable. But, again, not a bad film, it's just not really a good one either. I'm feeling a 6.2 on this one."

The movie is quite refreshing and the only negative is that it seems a little stretched during the middle period, but only slightly so. The songs, especially all izz well are quite entertaining. The movie has no violence and the plot is quite realistic. The atmosphere of the engineering college in the movie is not very far from most engineering colleges in India. Aamir and Madhavan do not look out of place amongst young college students, so hats off to them. All in all, it's a great watch. I would recommend it to anyone who'd want to see a light comedy movie."

It does not only titillates but also gives a strong message to change our education system, to change the rote learning method that we hold dear. In his typical style Rajkumar Hirani again gives a strong message with strong fun quotient,that catches everyone's funny bone and wit. Every character in the movie has acted brilliantly, despite their small roles Kareena,Madhavan and even Millimeter(I don't know his real name) excel. Chatur aka \"Silencer\" has given marvelous performance in his first Bollywood movie.Thoug it is based on 5 point someone but it takes very few scenes from the blockbuster novel and the most certainly it is more entertaining than the novel. Watch it for fun and for a strong message."

I appreciated that it wasn't linear, which actually helped setting up some mystery and revealing surprises that caught me off guard. The amazing story itself also helped. Although some of what the main character said about teaching was a bit too philosophical, the idea behind it in the movie were still impactful and relevant. Stress in school is a real deal, not only back in when the movie is made. I think that some better execution and writing could make the theme more impactful and profound, but this is still relatable enough.\n\nAnother great achievement was the mixing of serious theme with light-weight comedy. Despite how much I laughed at the funny jokes or goofy characters, this doesn't undermine the message that the movie was going for. That was not an easy thing to do, considering how usual Bollywood movies like to accommodate comedy.\n\nEven though I have problems with the movie, they don't bother me as much as others. The runtime was still long, as I think a good 15-20 minutes can be easily cut off. One part is to get rid of the musicals. All the musicals and dancings in the movie only occurred near the beginning, and most of them were not necessary, except the one that transitioned into a very dark scene.\n\nI said that the storytelling was solid, but the scenes where the characters got rewarded felt cheesy and not as satisfying as I wanted.\n\nOverall, I definitely see why this is one of the classics. 8-8.5/10."

I cried and laughed throughout the film for countless times because it is naturally relatable. This film is comedy but you will feel everything from the soul. I never rated a film 10 out of 10 but this one is an exception, not for its perfection but for how it makes us want to live imperfectly but in our very way. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ANYONE!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Looking for a silly comedy? This has you covered. I guess the title suggests an element of farce and it sure delivers. Farhan (R. Madhavan) fakes a heart attack to get off a plane that's just about to leave Delhi, to pick up his mate Raju (Sharman Joshi), after getting a call that their mate Rancho (Aamir Khan) is on his way. We don't know why, but this news creates a lot of excitement. Unnecessarily it seems as Rancho isn't really on his way. Chatur (Omi) has brought them to a meeting at their old college campus, the setting were 10 years earlier, he'd challenged Rancho to a bet to see who'd be the more successful on their return. Fahran and Raju's excitement is because they've not seen Rancho in 5 years, he's disappeared, he's not at the meeting, but Chatur says he knows where he is. First though we'll travel back to how the friends met. At university, where Rancho instantly proves himself a bit of a maverick. He's the smart unconventional one. The others don't know what to make of him, but admire him. He's apparently from a wealthy family, the others far less so. But Rancho sees the world from an idyllic viewpoint, seeing the possibility and promise in everything and everyone. It's all a bit light and fluffy, like a teen movie, just translated from California to India. It's playful, even employing a few Bollywood style dance numbers, which I'll confess I really enjoyed. Blasts of colour, sweeping cameras, beautiful synced choreography, it really is a lot of fun to watch. For all it's joy, it's not scared to hit the darker side too. The school for engineers they study at is highly revered and the pressure immense. From themselves, perhaps their families, certainly the teachers. The tyrannical head of the school, nicknamed Virus, doesn't like them either, especially Rancho. Mainly down to the fact that in Rancho he's found a nemesis. Smarter, younger, much more likeable. Here again it echoes those 80s American high school movies. Virus is Rooney from Ferris Bueller! I'm not laughing hysterically throughout, but it is funny. Rancho is fond of a joke to make his point, that work should be fun. But one such gaff pushes fellow student and teachers pet Chatur over the edge, ridiculing him in front of the whole school. This is what brings us to the fateful scene, where the bet is made that he'll be more successful in 10 years time. This becomes the catalyst for a great twist, one that I'm loathed to spoil. Rancho is an inspiring fellow, but he's much more than what we see on the surface. It's a truly heartwarming story, overly sentimental yes, far too long yes, packed full of cliche yes, but it's so lovely. It's the silliest thing I've watched in ages, but it's infectious and all the characters are wonderful, you're rooting for everyone, not just the 3 Idiots. Even at its nearly 3 hour runtime, it rattles along at a decent pace. A tangle of characters, relationships, timelines and story arcs. It's not ground-breaking, but I'm not sure I've seen anything else quite like it."

And, like most films of the genre, it has its share of the usual singing and dancing so foreign to films from other countries. One thing you should know, however, is that defining the type of film it is isn't really easy. Much of it is a comedy, but it also has many poignant moments (keep the Kleenex nearby), some existential moments where they explore the meaning of life and work and it's also a tender film about friendship. And, as my daughter pointed out when she saw the film, she loved that the men in the movie are not afraid to cry--something you rarely see in western films.\n\nAs for the plot, it's very long and involved and I could recount what occurs. But I don't want to spoil a single wonderful moment, so my advice is just sit back and watch--and if you give it a chance, I can almost guarantee you'll have a great time with this poignant and funny film. Wonderful and well worth your time--with a delightful script, wonderful characters and lots of moments that made me smile...and a few that brought me to tears. See this film."

They know that reciting the oversimplifying phrase will not provide their problems with a solution, or even a catalyst, but it gives them the onset courage they desperately need at a time of uncertainty and despair. One character even tries to use the line after an amateurishly-given birth may have gone terribly wrong. It's times like that when the saying may not be so effective, even if its goal is not to provide certain relief. Our title characters are ambitious but stunted Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan), jittery, fearful Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi), and borderline prodigy Ranchhoddas \"Rancho\" Shamaldas Chhanchad (Aamir Khan), three close friends who attend the Imperial College of Engineering (ICE), one of India's most prestigious colleges where only the best are accepted. The young boys already are facing some of life's greatest challenges, all of them pursuing the field of engineering when the only one who seems to have a passion for the material is Rancho. Farhan was forced to become skilled in the field because of his strict father, and Raju is pursuing the field with the goal of getting his family out of poverty, with his father's expensive health bills, his mother's fragile core, and his sister's inability to marry all on the table. Rancho is studying because he feels that one should pursue passion and make a career out of it, so it doesn't feel like work. If you're passionate and devoted to your work, success will find you - yet this is only one of the countless morals and insights 3 Idiots provide its viewer with. The film chronicles their issues in college in flashback, with instances in the presence popping up to show Farhan and Raju searching for their pal Rancho, who has disappeared and avoided contact for several years now. This is not your typical flashback film, however. It uses this method much to its advantage, and doesn't feel like a narrative within a narrative. It seals both stories nicely, but it takes the viewer on a roller-coaster ride of emotions through carefully constructed events before it even arrives at those endings. 3 Idiots also provides us with the idea that many Indian children are told what to become in life early and are discouraged from exploration or even personal ambition. This I can't believe. What an unhappy, uninspiring, completely wasted life to slog through everyday doing something you loathe all because it was the lucky career choice of your parents. Yet I'm sure millions have been lead through this same life. It's the worst way of \"living through a person\" that I can imagine. Through every quick-witted song and dance number, through every comedic scene, through every instance of dramatic despair, emotionally alive moment, solemnly poignant sequence, suspenseful setup, to a lovely, heartfelt conclusion, 3 Idiots is a wonderful, invaluable endeavor in the world of film. Its actors are beautifully fitting for their roles, assisted by a script so human and true to life that it is honestly hard to believe, and captured through beautifully alive cinematography to collectively give us a beautiful package not just in the figurative sense. This is arguably one of the best comedies I've ever seen."

The last plot twist scene, where Rancho is the head of all of the others and win their betting agreement on who will be more successful in the future made us amazed and fall for him. In the scene, Chatur (Rancho competitor) prides himself by itemizes in detail all his income and thinking he's advance in front of his friends. But in reality, Rancho was above all of them. He's not showing it but he made it and now we're even falling deeper for him. Another astonishing scene is when Rancho helps Pia's sister to give birth by video calling with Pia who is a doctor, he did it as instructed and saved the baby. Rancho is a genius.\n\nThe producer succeeds at choosing the right actor for each character. The actors (3 idiots) playing it well by them deepen each role to make it realistic real-life drama. It makes us as viewer addicted and wanted to have another season of the movie. We would say this movie is really recommended and worth for anyone who's interested in a comedy Bollywood movie. We're obviously going to rewatch this movie, but this movie is too long for those who are not interested in watching. In conclusion, this movie is suitable for teenagers above. Don't forget to rewatch!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Story: Rancho, Raju and Farhan enter the elite engineering college, only to learn lessons of life that cannot be taught through books and classrooms. Principal Viru Sahastrabuddhe is no help at all.\n\nMovie Review: Rest assured, all ye desi cinema buffs, Aal Izz Well in apna Bollywood. If 2009 can begin with Dev D and end with 3 Idiots, it is indeed time to sound the seetis and taalis for one of the most exciting years of contemporary Indian cinema. Truly, this has been the year of the I.d.i.o.t in movielore: the Intrinsically intelligent, Downright smart, Inimitable, Original and Talented film maker, actor, story teller, musician, lyricist, dialogue writer and producer.\n\nThe movie 3 Idiots is the perfect end to an exciting year for India: the year when the aam aadmi voted in progress, liberalism, secularism and turned his back to corruption, communalism, regionalism. The three idiots, Rancchoddas Shyamaldas Chanchad (Aamir Khan), Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) and Farhan Qureshi (R Madhavan), are perfect archetypes of the new age Indian who is essentially a non-conformist, questioning outmoded givens, choosing to live life on his own terms and chartering new roads that consciously skirt the rat race. Of course, they begin on the beaten track -- due to societal/parental pressure -- but refuse to become cogs in the wheel. Naturally, they end up as the Frostian hero (Robert Frost's Road Not Taken) who made all the difference to his life, and the world, by taking the road less travelled by.\n\nThe film begins with the entry of our threesome in the city's elite engineering college. It takes the first tryst with the mandatory ragging sessions which enunciate who the leader of the gang is going to be: new entrant Baba Rancchoddas, as his friends fondly call him. Rancho not only leads his friends through the maze of India's competitive, high-pressure, rote-heavy, illogical and almost cruel education system, he tutors them on several life mantras too. Like, running after excellence, not success; questioning not blindly accepting givens; inventing and experimenting in lieu of copying and cramming; and essentially following your heart's calling if you truly want to make a difference.\n\nSo, you have the threesome embroiled, time and again, in a confrontation with authority, as represented through the domineering figure of Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), the unsmiling Principal who venerates the cuckoo because the bird's life begins with murder. Kill the competition, because there is only one place at the top, believes the Princi. Poor, mistaken Princi! Doesn't he know that competition is effete, model students like Chatur (Omi) end up as duhs in real life and non-conformists (Rancho and Rocket Singh Inc), who care tuppence about being on top, could end up as eventual winners. More importantly, they could be high not only in IQ (intelligence quotient) but in EQ (emotional quotient) too, never losing their humaneness and social networking skills.\n\nThe high point of the film is the fact that director Rajkumar Hirani says so much, and more, without losing his sense of humour and the sheer lightness of being. The film is a laugh riot, despite being high on fundas. Certain sequences almost have you rolling in the aisle, like the ragging sequence, Omi's chamatkar/balatkar speech, the threesome's wedding crasher sequence, their mournful meal with Raju's mournful mum and Rancho's sundry demos to prove how Kareena has chosen the wrong guy for herself. Add to this, the strong emotional core of the film that makes gentle tugs, now and then, at your guts, and you have an almost perfect score. Hirani carries forward his simplistic 'humanism alone works' philosophy of the Lage Raho Munnabhai series in 3 Idiots too, making it a warm and vivacious signature tune to 2009. The second half of the film does falter in parts, specially the child birth sequence, but it doesn't take long for the film to jump back on track. Amongst the performances, Aamir Khan is stupendous as the rule-breaker Rancho. But the rest of the cast doesn't remain in the shadows. Both Sharman and Madhavan manage to carve their independent characters as lovable rebels too. Even Kareena shines out, despite the minuscule length of her role. A special mention for Boman Irani who is impeccable as 'Virus', the vile Principal and newcomer Omi who perfectly slips into the stereotype of the best, albeit bakwas student. Shantanu Moitra's music score, which may have sounded pheeka in the audio version, comes alive on screen with lyricist Swanand Kirkire giving India its clarion call for 2010: Aal Izz Well. Rush for it. A word about:\n\nPerformances: Believe it or not, but Aamir, Madhavan and Sharman actually look -- and behave -- like students. While Aamir pitches in a near-perfect portrayal of Rancho, the free-spirited innovator, Madhavan and Sharman are perfectly in sync too. Kareena as the independent-minded medical student is winsome; debutant Omi has a refreshing flair for comedy and Boman Irani doesn't ham or go over the top even once.\n\nStory: Rajkumar Hirani and Abhijat Joshi script a warm and humanist indictment of India's rude-crude education system that prepares rats for a rat race rather than thinkers for a new world.\n\nDialogue: Witty and wild, the film walks away with the best comic scene of the year citation with its uproarious 'balatkar' speech.\n\nMusic: Shantanu Moitra may not have forced you to pick up the music album of the film but the songs do come alive on screen, specially Zoobie-Doobie and Aal Izz Well.\n\nChoreography: Avit Diaz has the threesome -- Aamir, Madhavan, Sharman -- kick up some wild fun in Aal Izz Well, while Bosco-Caesar rightly go retro with Zoobie-Doobie.\n\nCinematography: The streets of Delhi and the picture postcard beauty of Ladakh are captured in riveting images by Muraleedharan CK.\n\nStyling: Designers Manish Mehrotra, Sheena Parekh and Raghuveer Shetty create the pucca campus look for our rumbustious kids on the block, complete with ganjis and capris. Kareena too is an archetypal Dilli gal with her trendy, not flashy ensemble.\n\nInspiration: Chetan Bhagat's Five Point Someone literally comes alive on screen, although the film does not kowtow the book verbatim."

It was a uproarious comedy mixed with poignant drama to shed some truth on the absurd pressures of academia. I feel like any grad student in any country would get a ton out of this film's spirit and message. All is, indeed, well when you put your friends first.\n\nThe film is close to 3 hours long but with so much warmth, laughs and visual flair the time just flies by. It is amazing how much of life is packed into its run time. I loved every second of this film. I think Khan's charisma and gravity as a the offbeat, wise Ranco is the key to the film. So much of the film is about his viewpoint that it is really hard to not fall in love this guy.\n\nFor western audiences this films reminds me of Animal House mixed with Dead Poet's Society. Plus Bollywood epic visuals and musical. The combination is quite intoxicating."

Thanks to the splendid Performance by Amir, he owned it indeed, some other acting crew were average and also I think that the duration was too long and I believe it could have been less longer. I noticed that Indian like their films to surpass the two-hours timeframe which might be deemed to be a weakness because you want to keep the viewers awake and you don't want them to yawning, also films suppose to save time or some viewers rather read the book that this movie was based on, you will be moved by the movie and it will absolutely change your mindset after you will have done."

The shots are wonderful and the movie breathes an atmosphere of 'joi de vivre' and playfulness. The casting of the main characters is on point and they seem to be enjoying themselves. The central morale/message that is conveyed in the flick is universally recognizable but put on way too heavy to my taste.\n\nI must admit that I am not a frequent viewer of the Bollywoord genre, I came across the title reviewing the IMDb top 250 and became curious because of the high rating.

        "review_detailed_main": "Based on the book Five Point Someone this is the story of three new friends trying to survive the universe and the university of information technology. The first half was quite entertaining with a series of flashbacks creating a college comedy where the rambunctious students clash with the strict and traditionalist teacher/school. Some of the messages about suicide, peer pressure, parental expectations and teaching methods were presented quite well, though possibly a bit heavy handedly, and generated some of the genuinely heartfelt moments. The second half relied on a clunky and forced mystery plot device that undermined the previously laid platform and required a character to act completely and unrealistically out of character. It also became more manipulative, corny and overwrought in excessively turning on the tears and trying to wrench the audiences hearts every second minute.\n\nThe romance was all right, though it took too much of centre stage too late. A couple of generally well known adages were passed off as original dialogue which detracts from the credibility of the rest of the script. Specifically these were anecdotes about the million dollar American space pen being trumped by the Russian pencil and the toothpaste that's unable to be put back in the tube. The actors were all on cue with the comedy even if they weren't really age appropriately cast. I found the 44 years old Aamir Khan to play it a bit over the top with his attempts at boy genius mannerisms (putting his finger to his mouth) offputting.\n\nThe songs were certainly catchy, though the lyrics tended to be rather simplistic eg: \"Give me some sunshine, Give me some rain, Give me another chance, I want to grow up once again\". However, the dance scenes were excellent with the highlight the main romantic to and fro which was only let down by the inclusion of the chicken dance. I still don't understand whether these dance scenes are fantasy or real especially when they are included in a character's real flashback memories. I will continue to presume they are fantasy despite cinematic liberties being taken.\n\nThe Indian locations provided some beautiful scenery and were well shot and served the scenes well. The total running time of three hours was unnecessarily long and some needless scenes (eg the birth scene) could have been significantly shortened. Overall it was an enjoyable film, but it was only good and not as great as it is being touted by some."

        "review_detailed_main": "Three Idiots is a groundbreaking Bollywood hit that was released ahead of its time. This film is a comedy with great acting, unique characters, a complex plot, and, most importantly, a very inspiring film about choosing the correct route in life.\n\nThe film's makers depicted some breathtaking views of Ladakh's rugged environment. These sequences were captured using a variety of camera angles, including high angle, crane, and parallax views. These bright images were cleverly employed to suggest that a pleasant and exciting event was on the way. I thought the video was highly informative in the manner it seeks to raise awareness and educate viewers about the rising danger of suicides in India's school system. The tone of the picture shifts quickly from joyful to sorrowful to funny, and so on. As a result, the picture became more exciting since I was continually on the edge of my seat, waiting to see what intriguing incident would unfold. I used to believe that all Bollywood films were low-budget and had bad performers, but I've since learned that some of their actors are very convincing, even by Hollywood standards! These acting talents have inspired me to watch more Bollywood films since they have shown me how exceptional they can be.\n\nThank you."

The humor in the movie is terrible, the switching of language is annoying, and the cinematography is horrendous. I don't know how Bollywood directors look back at these movies and think that they have made a masterpiece. The only reason this movie is so highly rated is because the Indian fanbase is a large and keeps coming onto this website and leaving ten star reviews when their movie knowledge is nonexistent. Overall this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and should not be anywhere close to the top 100."

You go through a roller coaster ride of happiness, sorrow, anger, empathy all spread out throughout the movie and I must say it is one hell of a ride! It is true that some portions of the movie are exaggerated than they need to be, but at the same time you are laughing your ass off that you simply overlook them. It is not a dumb college comedy that you expect from the title, it touches upon many sensitive subjects in the veil of comedy.And the best part is, it is never old and even after watching it multiple times, it still feels fresh and revitalizing.If you are a comedy lover like me, I would recommend it and if you are not, I would still recommend it because it is more than just a comedy."

Throughout the movie (3 Idiots) it has bored the public by giving same message over and over again that the obtaining high percentage is not the deciding factor of one's talent. However, we all have passed through or are going through the education system and we all are already aware of this fact. Even if some may be unaware of this fact, there are many iconic personalities which provide same message through their life achievements that education is no hindrance to one's success.Dhirubhai Ambani and Sachin Tendulkar are such iconic personalities.\n\nRocket Singh gives same message in the earlier part of the movie without boring the audience.This makes Rocket Singh a must watch movie."

It's genuinely funny and charming in many scenes. You forgive it when it piles melodrama on melodrama. But as we go through the second half you witness the structure come undone, the director packing everything in as though ticking items off a list, and the humour is drained away. Some plot points of the second half are rammed in without consideration for the whole. It lets itself down after such a fun first half."

Kareena Kapoor does overact but is covered by Aamir Khan's good acting.\n\nCollege is tough in real life so the movie is more fun. The college dean Viru Sahastrabuddhe, called Virus (Boman Irani) is always on the look out for Rancho (Aamir Khan) and end up being outsmarted every time.\n\n10/10 definitely watch it."

During their travel they reminiscence about their college days, and let's just say that those days did not suffer from a lack of excitement.\n\nThe film is very much a comedy, but it has undertones of satire when it comes to India's school system and the way students are so pushed to excel, to get good grades, to get a good jobs, to provide for their families through success, that it often leads to self-destructive throughts and behaviour.\n\nNevertheless, for the most part the focus of the film is on these three friends and their individual ways to get through college. And in that aspect the film absolutely shines. These are three great characters, each played masterfully by their respective actors. Their ordeals during college are pretty unbelievable, but in a good way. I also like that the film can be serious and solemn when the situation calls for it. There are touching scenes in this film, which almost made me teary-eyed.\n\nIf I had to name a flaw, I would say that the film is a bit on the long side. I did find myself checking the clock once or twice towards the end. The film has enough content to keep you interested until the very end, but some could definitely be trimmed.\n\nStill, this is a great film. Great dialogues, amazing characters, clever plot twists and enough energy to keep you going for days. Heavily recommended."

The best part is being played by Amir Khan who actually believed in skilled learning rather than bookish language. And to prove this he make some changes in the speech of the Chatur and showed that learning like a parrot will not help unless u study and do what ur interest is. I just like the movie very much. Another scene where these three goes to Farhan's home to have dinner and his mother uses that itching 'belan' to roll the chapatis. Yuck!!!

Aamir Khan's performance as a 22 year old Engineering student is absolutely appalling, however it is not as irritating as Boman Irani's performance as your stereotypical principal who has least favourite students.\n\nSecondly, the storyline is just boring (I am not only saying this because it is a different storyline) - it is not at all realistic and to be perfectly honest it has little to it.\n\nThirdly, the songs are just annoying...especially the stupid 'All is well!!' If I could rate this film below 1 I would rate it into them minuses!"

        "review_detailed_main": "3 Idiots is an Indian comedy film directed by Rajkumar Hirani. This film was based on a novel called 'Five Point Someone' that was written by an Indian author, Chetan Bhagat. This film was released in 2009 and became a success as it became one of the most popular films worldwide at that time.\n\n3 Idiots tells us a story of three buddies named Rancho, Farhan, and Raju who attend the Imperial College of Engineering, an elite college in India. This film conveys and judges the educational system of India. Aamir Khan played Rancho in the role of a genius and motivational student. Ranganathan Madhayan played Farhan who was forced by his strict father to pursue engineering but has a dream to become a wildlife photographer. Sharman Joshi as Raju who is pursuing engineering to get his family out of poverty but is struggling to keep up with uni-life. Another character who played a big role in this film is their extremely-strict dean, Viru Sahastrabuddhe who was played by Boman Irani.\n\nI don't find myself watching Bollywood films that much. Especially comedy. I was kinda doubtful before watching this film even though my friend said it's one of the best films she has ever watched. A long 3 hours of comedy just didn't sit right with me- That was before I gave it a try to watch this. Never thought that this could turn out so good. It didn't start that well for me- but getting into the film for an hour, it was starting to get so entertaining and interesting. 3 idiots had success to make these 3 hours feel like nothing for me. The film; no doubt- leaves a great impression on me. I love how smooth the storyline goes. I never get confused when the timeline changes from ten years ago to the present. I experienced such a roller coaster of emotion watching this film. . Maybe because it is a Bollywood film, I didn't expect any particular scenes so the storyline for me wasn't predictable. All the humorous situations are present but then the story pulls back with a serious situation; poignant moments which could get you on nerves or even cry. This film was so nicely made; thanks to the wonderful script and the outstanding acting of the cast.\n\nThis film surely tells you about the meaning of life; also a wholesome and meaningful friendship between these 3 'idiots'. The message in this film- I don't find anything new, I've been hearing from here and there that big grades don't mean success. You gotta believe in yourself, do your passion, and don't let others choose your life path. I'm always on the same page with this quote-unquote life advice. But this film opened my eyes wider and wider. It was because of the twist at the end of the film. Revealing the identity of Rancho. He proves that all he's saying to his friends and teacher throughout the story is right; don't chase success. Achieve excellence and it will come to you itself. He proved it in a way that I didn't expect, I was shocked in fact. I'm not going to say the details and spoils each scene that was memorable for me. You better watch this film for yourself at least once. Just throw yourself to watch it. I bet you'll have a great time with all the comedies and twists that you'll never expect."

He has done tremendous acting. Everybody can miss his speech during a college fest. He believe in cramp the books as long.\n\nIt was a moral message too like we should not impose any occupation on our children's. I have watched this movie 10 times."

        "review_title": "Chase excellence, and success will follow, pants down",
        "review_detailed_main": "That's a line that's repeated a few times in 3 idiots, which I think says a lot about the film. Although a lot of films that hit big at the box office are lackluster and forgettable, 3 Idiots is actually a perfect example of the line it repeats several times. Those involved in the film have certainly chased excellence- they've made a great movie that entertains with humor and emotion, all while teaching some valuable lessons to students, their parents, and their teachers.\n\nIf you don't know already, 3 Idiots tells the story of 3 friends in college.Two of them are mediocre students, who's lives are changed when they meet Rancho, an eccentric, but brilliant student with an unorthodox way of learning and leading his life. The story is told in a flashback as Raju, Farhan, and their college nemesis Chatur (nicknamed Silencer) journey to find Rancho, who has been missing for the past 10 years.\n\nI'll start off with the most appealing aspect of the film. It is hilarious! I watch both Bollywood and Hollywood films, and I can't remember the last time I saw a film from either that made me laugh this hard. I saw the film 2 days ago, and I'm still laughing just thinking about some of the scenes. And this is everything from the jokes, the comedic scenes, to the really funny and cool characters. But what's even better, is that rather than giving us yet another forgettable comedy, Rajkumar Hirani has managed to find an almost perfect balance between the comedy and the emotion, much like he did in the Munnabhai films. Similar to those, Hirani has put in some strong messages into the film. One, as I've mentioned, is the importance of pursuing excellence, rather than success. Another is the simple, \"all izz well,\" idea-- that you should try and keep calm, rather than worry all the time. As a college student, I could relate a lot to both of those. But that's not all-- The film also provides a good lesson to parents, that you should let your children decide for themselves about a career, rather than force them into one. Further still, it shows us the problems with the typical methods of learning-- the mindless memorization of facts-- which is much less important than learning to apply concepts.\n\nNext, let's talk about the characters. Right from the time I heard Aamir Khan and Madhavan were signed on for this movie, I've been hearing complaints that they were too old. I won't lie- neither of them look like they can pass for a 20 year old, but once I saw them on screen, I stopped worrying. Both give such wonderful and natural performances that I didn't even think about ages. This is especially true for Aamir, who just seemed like he was having so much fun with the role of Rancho that I just couldn't help but love him. Sharman Joshi also did a nice job with his role, especially in some of his more emotional scenes. Kareena's role was a bit small, but she still makes her mark. I really liked her character, and wished she had been in the film a bit more.\n\nThe film of course, isn't perfect. There were definitely a few moments that I thought were overly dramatic, and one even a bit tacky. Also, the love story, although it wasn't meant to be the focus, was a bit under developed. Overall, though, the film is really heart warming and inspiring enough for me to overlook the flaws.\n\nI'd happily recommend this to anyone who wants to see a great comedy that both entertains and teaches. Looking at other comments on the IMDb boards and stuff, I'm reading a lot of complaints about how the film is unrealistic, characters are exaggerated, etc. Here's what I say to you folks- if you expected some kind of masterful art film, you came looking in the wrong place. This is a feel good commercial film through and through. So yes, Rancho comes off as unrealistically perfect, and the headmaster is a caricature. If this kind of stuff tends to bother you, I'd stay away from this film. BUT, if you're looking for a commercial, unrealistic yet relatable feel-good entertainer with some nice messages, I highly recommend 3 Idiots to you."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's absolutely true. When I first sat to watch the movie I knew I was going to be thoroughly enjoyed. There was a, very high level of expectation. And is absolutely natural though. Why? The answer is very simple. There is a name associated with the movie. ------------------------------AMIR KHAN--------------------------------- Being a avid movie goer I am fan of a whole lot of actors. But whether you have a favourite actor or not,you got to love this man. Specially to those who regularly follows Hindi movies I mean Bollywood movies. He always stands out in every aspects in which he steps into.However the character of RANCHO is his one of the best creation ever.\n\nI saw a huge lot of films - Hindi,Tamil,Bengali,Telegu,French,Korean,Chinese,Japanese,Turkish and mostly English. But, nothing ever prompt me or rather touches me so deeply as this to right a review on IMDb.The most precious part of the movie is it's acting crew. It is simply heart taking & heart breaking during the sad part as well. I am not getting into any particular actor's work but the main 3 leads are invincible so as to say in one word. Some may think that Amir is looking confused and over elaborative in some part of the movie but I think it's the need of the character to make it believable, not like another contemporary Hero who is king of his college and can't be disposed of. The direction of the film is very different from other Rajkumar Hirani's other film and mature too,of course.The music is simply awesome:melodious, sweet and is absolutely fitting with the movie. The movie is not great for all the above of these. It's only because the message for the contemporary and outdated educational system & the so-called social patterns in which the poor and lower middle class families are still running on the hope of their son's burdened shoulders and unblossomed futures. The things are so purely shown that you can't deny it. And that's the best part::Acceptance to the audience. So,if you are still reading this then don't just go and watch the movie otherwise you won't know what you are going to miss. As I said earlier It can change your thoughts about your life and future."

It really makes you believe that the songs collection is nearly perfect. Each song included has powerful meaning ... in simple words -Aal iz well.\n\n3-idiots is undoubtedly the best work of Aamir Khan so far. This movie has lessons and i believe it has contributed to many people alter their way of thinking. The best I believe is that you go for excellence, success will follow you.\n\nConsidering this a masterpiece of Aamir Khan, I can't deduct a single from my vote."

So, never run after the success, let it happen automatically in the life.\n\n2.Freedom To Life Don't die before actual death. Live every moment to the fullest as you are going to die today night. Life is gifted to humankind to live, live & live @ happiness.\n\n3. Passion Leads To Excellence When your hobby becomes your profession and passion becomes your profession. You will be able to lead up to excellence in the life. Satisfaction, pleasure, joy and love will be the outcome of following passion. Following your passion for years, you will surely become something one day.\n\n4. Learning Is Very Simple Teachers do fail. Learners never fail. Learning is never complicated or Learning is always possible whatever rule you apply.\n\n5.Pressure At Head Current education system is developing pressures on students' head. University intelligence is useful and making some impact in the life but it cannot be at the cost of the life.\n\n6.Life Is Emotion Management Not Intelligence Optimization Memory and regular study have definite value and it always helps you in leading a life. You are able to survive even if you can make some mark in the path of the life. With artificial intelligence, you can survive and win but you cannot prove yourself genius. Therefore, in this process genius dies in you.\n\n7.Necessity Is The Mother Of Invention Necessity creates pressure and forces you to invent something or to make it happen or to use your potentiality. Aamir Khan in this film, 3 idiots, is able to prove in the film by using aqua guard pump at the last moment.\n\n8.Simplicity is Life Life is need base never want base. Desires have no ends. Simplicity is way of life and Indian culture highly stresses on simple living and high thinking, and this is the way of life: 'Legs down to earth and eyes looking beyond the sky'\n\n9. Industrial Leadership Dean of the institute in 3 idiots is showing very typical leadership. He has his own principles, values and ideology, and he leads the whole institute accordingly. This is an example of current institutional leadership. In the present scenario, most of the institutes are fixed in a block or Squarish thinking.\n\n10. Love Is Time & Space Free Love is not time bound and space bound. It is very well demonstrated this movie same love was demonstrated by Krishna and Meera. Love is border free, time free and space free.\n\n11.Importance Of One Word In Communication If communication dies, everything dies. Each word has impact and value in communication. One word if used wrongly or emphasized wrongly or paused at a wrong place in communication what effect it creates and how is it affected is demonstrated very well in this movie.\n\n12. Mediocrity Is Penalized Middle class family or average talent or average institute is going to suffer and has to pay maximum price in the life if they do not upgrade their living standards. To be born poor or as an average person is not a crime but to die as an average person with middle class talent is miserable and if you are unable to optimize your potentiality and die with unused potentiality then that is your shameful truth. One should not die as a mediocre. He/she has to bring out genius inside him/her and has to use his/her potentiality to the optimum level."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rest assured, all ye Desi cinema buffs, Aal Izz Well in apna Bollywood. If 2009 can begin with Dev D and end with 3 Idiots, it is indeed time to sound the seetis and taalis for one of the most exciting years of contemporary Indian cinema. Truly, this has been the year of the I.d.i.o.t in movie lore: the Intrinsically intelligent, Downright smart, Inimitable, Original and Talented film maker, actor, story teller, musician, lyricist, dialogue writer and producer.\n\n3 Idiots is the perfect end to an exciting year for India: the year when the aam aadmi voted in progress, liberalism, secularism and turned his back to corruption, communal ism, regionalism. The three idiots, Rancchoddas Shyamaldas Chanchad (Aamir Khan), Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) and Farhan Qureshi (R Madhavan), are perfect archetypes of the new age Indian who is essentially a non-conformist, questioning outmoded givens, choosing to live life on his own terms and chartering new roads that consciously skirt the rat race. Of course, they begin on the beaten track -- due to societal/parental pressure -- but refuse to become cogs in the wheel. Naturally, they end up as the Frostian hero (Robert Frost's Road Not Taken) who made all the difference to his life, and the world, by taking the road less traveled by.\n\nThe film begins with the entry of our threesome in the city's elite engineering college. It takes the first tryst with the mandatory ragging sessions which enunciate who the leader of the gang is going to be: new entrant Baba Rancchoddas, as his friends fondly call him. Rancho not only leads his friends through the maze of India's competitive, high-pressure, rote-heavy, illogical and almost cruel education system, he tutors them on several life mantras too. Like, running after excellence, not success; questioning not blindly accepting givens; inventing and experimenting in lieu of copying and cramming; and essentially following your heart's calling if you truly want to make a difference.\n\nSo, you have the threesome embroiled, time and again, in a confrontation with authority, as represented through the domineering figure of Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), the unsmiling Principal who venerates the cuckoo because the bird's life begins with murder. Kill the competition, because there is only one place at the top, believes the Princi. Poor, mistaken Princi! Doesn't he know that competition is effete, model students like Chatur (Omi) end up as duh in real life and non-conformists (Rancho and Rocket Singh Inc), who care tuppence about being on top, could end up as eventual winners. More importantly, they could be high not only in IQ (intelligence quotient) but in EQ (emotional quotient) too, never losing their humaneness and social networking skills.\n\nThe high point of the film is the fact that director Rajkumar Hirani says so much, and more, without losing his sense of humor and the sheer lightness of being. The film is a laugh riot, despite being high on fundas. Certain sequences almost have you rolling in the aisle, like the ragging sequence, Omi's chamatkar/balatkar speech, the threesome's wedding crasher sequence, their mournful meal with Raju's mournful mum and Rancho's sundry demos to prove how Kareena has chosen the wrong guy for herself. Add to this, the strong emotional core of the film that makes gentle tugs, now and then, at your guts, and you have an almost perfect score. Hirani carries forward his simplistic 'humanism alone works' philosophy of the Lage Raho Munnabhai series in 3 Idiots too, making it a warm and vivacious signature tune to 2009. The second half of the film does falter in parts, specially the child birth sequence, but it doesn't take long for the film to jump back on track.\n\nAmongst the performances, Aamir Khan is stupendous as the rule-breaker Rancho. But the rest of the cast doesn't remain in the shadows. Both Sharman and Madhavan manage to carve their independent characters as lovable rebels too. Even Kareena shines out, despite the minuscule length of her role. A special mention for Boman Irani who is impeccable as 'Virus', the vile Principal and newcomer Omi who perfectly slips into the stereotype of the best, albeit bakwas student. Shantanu Moitra's music score, which may have sounded pheeka in the audio version, comes alive on screen with lyricist Swanand Kirkire giving India its clarion call for 2010: Aal Izz Well. Rush for it.\n\nSource : The Times of India!"

Aamir acted well , he was entirely focused as a protagonist in the movie. But the other two guys steal the show with their less but solid, emotional presence.\n\nBeing a software engineer, i would like to tell you that the movie resembles with every Engineer of Indian colleges.\n\nHostel life,masti with friends, exam tensions, every aspect of the students have been touched in the movie.Aamir , sharman, madhavan are Mechanical engineering student, you will laugh till your tummy aches in some scenes.\n\nIn the end me,Pushkar says \"A fantastic Movie\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rajkumar Hirani's 3 Idiots are really sensible. Like his previous Munnabhai series,his latest release 3Idiots starring Aamir Khan, Sharman Joshi, R. Madhvan, Kareena Kapoor, Boman Irani and Mona Singh too strikes the chord with the word Go. After watching the movie everyone will have a new theory in their lives of Aal Izz Well.\n\nThe story begins with Farhan and Raju on a journey in the search of their friend Rancho (Aamir Khan) in the exclusive locales of Simla and Ladak. While their journey continues, the movie takes a flashback and unwinds the story of the three idiots of their college days- Ranchodas Shyamaldas Chanchad (Aamir Khan), Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhvan) and Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi).\n\nRancho, Raju and Farhan are the students of the premier IIT College. Rancho is a different than rest of the students; he can't live the way others live. He is an overpowering thinker and also has the capability to change the people views. He leads his mates all the way through this irrational, high-pressure, rote-heavy and malicious education system and teaches them the way to overcome the stupid ideologies. And above all he tutors and guides them as to how to deal with the baddie of the college- the Dean himself, Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani).\n\nOn one hand, Rancho is a sensible thinker and on the other he is a true lover of the sweet girl Pia (Kareena Kapoor). But to make his life difficult and more complicated Pia is the daughter of Rancho's arch adversary Mr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe.\n\nAbove all the trio manages to handle their each problem and lead their lives happily as well as have fun to the core. The movie takes the viewer through a roller-coaster ride fill with loads of witty one liner and keeps tickling the bone as the film proceeds. The movie's classic humour gives no time to rest and one dies laughing; until one fine day when Rancho suddenly disappears from everyone's life. Post interval the movie exposes the emotional side of the story. The disappearing act of Rancho leaves people flabbergasted as the person who changed the people's ideology for life and thought them reasoning was lost.\n\nRajkumar Hirani really deserves a standing ovation for the film. Like his previous films this movie to carries the message- A message as to how a student is pressurised and burdened under the parent's expectations to make it big in this world; and one who fails as well as is unable to bear this laden commits suicide. The movie is for all ages and makes everyone think.\n\nThe script by Hirani and Joshi is perfect. Muraleedharan C.K's cinematography is excellent. The dialogues are humours and hard-hitting. Shantanu Moitra's music is average. The lyrics are catchy yet sensible.\n\nThe actors are just impeccable and everyone delivers their best. Aamir Khan is rocking and this is his one of the finest work till date. Sharman Joshi and R. Madhvan are immaculate and unstoppable. Boman Irani is like other films totally flawless and Kareena Kapoor is superb.\n\nAll in all, a must watch flick and one of the finest movies of the year. Go grab it!!! But the real hero of Three Idiots is the guy who gave us jaadu ki jhappi and Gandhigiri. Raju Hirani, you are the man! After all the terrible films and flops this year, you have ensured that in the end, Aall Izz Well."

        "review_detailed_main": "3 idiots is truly the \"Dil chahta hai\" of the year. Rajkumar Hirani once again leaves the audience spellbound with his amazing screen play and direction.The movie is a first class entertainer. Films like these are sure to be appreciated over the years to come. The first half of the movie is really good and Boman's performance is exceptional. The second half is good,but slightly drags in some scenes but it doesn't hurt the film much. 3 idiots is not only an exceptional film, it is arguably the film of the year. Hirani once again proves his caliber in handling serious matters in a funny way.the film tackles the minus points of the Indian educational system.the movie delivers a strong message and it tries to avoid melodramatic scenes as far as possible, which was the minor and only drawback of the \"Munna bhai\" series.I can't recommend the movie enough.Frankly, it is one of the movies which is worth watching with your family.Three cheers for Aamir,Boman and Hirani. Rating- 8.5/10"

Viru years to accept this simple truth. Movie clearly shows how mechanical and bookish current generation professors are even in top technical college of India called IIT. (name changed to ICE in movie)\n\nMovie explores bright and dark side of IITians. After all strip tease and spicy jokes, i'm sure every student and there parents have secretly taken a message from it. Every father wants his son to be top paid engineer. Under this intense emotional pressure from parents, students commits suicide when they failed to get good grades because they are not made to be an engineer.\n\nOnce audience settles down from choking laughters, they are silently told college is not about pleasing your professors and getting good grades. One should really focus on earning knowledge. Even last grade person managed to get job.\n\nMBAs might not be happy to see this. When you spend every breath of your teen life to become an engineer and love technology and suddenly you do MBA and start working in bank. Whats the point? Leaves all of us thinking.\n\nOverall, movie is awesome with laughters and emotions well spunned together. Must watch for all youngsters."

But I think there are other ways that people can contribute to the society other than going to good unis. This movie can teach some important lessons to Japanese society and its students."

It's a story of their hostel days that swings between Rancho's romance with the spirited Pia, and his clash with an oppressive mentor, Viru Sahastrabudhhe. And then one day, suddenly, Rancho vanished. Who was he? Where did he come from? Why did he leave? The friend who influenced and inspired them to think creatively and independently, even as the conformist world called them \"three idiots.\" Where is the original idiot now?

Wonderful direction, absolutely wonderful performances, lovely cinematography, the gorgeous Kareena and other wonderful actors make it all worthwhile. The movie made a total gross of US$80 million worldwide, a big one for a Hindi movie, is still selling the DVDs and Blurays, although many Hindi movies have begun to cross US$20-30 million in gross collections now. If you believe in A class, cinema in its splendor kind of entertaining movies, do not miss it.\n\nIMDb editors need to look at the worldwide gross as well in case of non-US blockbusters like this one and not only the US domestic gross which states it as US$6 million plus here for this movie. A good no. of Indian films now gross over $20-30 million US dollars, sometimes worldwide, sometimes in India domestic market alone. Please ensure to get the worldwide figures to present the correct picture. Also, India happens to be worlds second largest movie loving and movie selling market on the planet, next to the USA.

Even though it is on a serious topic; it makes its points in entertaining yet understandable ways. The story is also extremely relatable.\n\nThe story really helps to make these points. It tells of a simple man named Rancho (Aamir Khan) who comes and changes a college based on his thinking. I think the story was very well played out and that the story and ideas fit in very well together.\n\nThe performances were splendid. As always, Aamir Khan never fails to impress. He played Rancho to the finest of his abilities. He had everything- from perfect comic timing to perfect emotions for serious scenes. Sharman Joshi and Madhavan also impressed and did their roles well. Kareena Kapoor was exceptional in her role; she fit it well. Omi Vaidya really impressed me, even though he can't speak Hindi he was still hilarious. And Boman Irani gave perhaps one of his finest performances. The accent, the style, the lisp, he did everything well.\n\nRajkumar Hirani, the director, is one of the finest film makers ever in Hindi Cinema. He makes good, thoughtful films which aren't mindless and are worth your time, and this film is definitely worth your time. His direction was superb.\n\nOverall, if you are looking for an entertaining, relatable, heartfelt, emotional, romantic, and serious film, watch 3 Idiots. Especially if you are in college or school, as you will then enjoy it even more. This is one of the best Indian films ever made."

Although suicides aren't that frequent but most people are under enormous burden to shine and shoulder the responsibilities of the family. The pressure is tremendous and the competition is very high. This film captures that, and the actors & film crew does the job very well, but most credit to the writers and musicians for the good songs. Like every film, views will vary among viewers but like almost all of top250 movie, this one has got a certain class. only drawback is the use of 40+ actors as engineering students. In India, 'elder' ones never go back to highschool/get a diploma. So that was odd.. If you haven't seen it yet, I recommend you to do it because its certainly worth your time and buck/download."

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched this movie many times. But, only now I find it time to write a review not out of my willingness but after reading a hell lot of reviews blaming India and Creativity.\n\nFirst of all creativity is not something originating out of your own brain. That's not the right way. Ideas are always the same, just like the sun rising in the East. Its up to you how to view the sunrise and take it. There doesn't need any creativity in finding new ways to cheat, kill, lie, crime, f**k or bad things. That's not creativity. That's, in fact, very much evil. If you want such creativity then you are not a man you are a devil or daemon.\n\nThat's what Rancho also speaks in the movie. Try to catch what Rancho speaks. He speaks about life, about philosophy, about aspirations and dreams. Creativity, in your sense as I just mentioned, is never helpful in making you a good and efficient man. It only pushes you more towards crime and evil. That's way too bad. A man doesn't need such creativity. Rancho speaks the same. We don't need something which is not productive. We need to follow our excellence, not success.\n\nReal creativity lies in telling the same story again and again but with different new touch every time. Just like you experience and enjoy sun. We can't enjoy everyday, but love it whenever we experience. Nature doesn't change, but our perspective and mood change. Try to get into good mood by forgetting everything, bluffing your mind.that everything is alright and no need to worry. That's the success formula for Ranchod das Chanchad. I love his formula. Frame your own formula, but don't try to waste your intelligence and excellence for the sake of \"creativity\" which is unproductive neither to you nor to the society.\n\nEducation system is not in one person's hand. If any other country is as populated as India or China then they would experience the difficulties faced in Education system and Government. Try to express your sympathy at it, and try to help it - if possible. But, don't show your teeth at it or baffle it. That's the dignity of a homo sapein towards his race. If not, watch out for the day where they become dominate the world when the no of people matters not the amount of technology"
