        "review_detailed_main": "Saw 'The Emoji Movie' as a big fan of animation, to see whether the concept (which was one that was hard to decide whether it was intriguing or baffling) would work, as someone who has liked the previous work of a lot of the voice actors (i.e. Patrick Stewart) and whether it was as bad as the tsunami of negative publicity before release and when it came out made it out to be.\n\nAfter seeing it, there are worse films out there (animated and otherwise) but 'The Emoji Movie' is a mess, if not quite the recipe/incarnate for cancer that has been described. Regarding the target audience from personal experience (this doesn't mean that it will apply to all audiences or everybody's experiences), 'The Emoji Movie' didn't appeal to either children or adults in my cinema screening. Adults were squirming their way throughout the film and while recognising the things that are referenced were groaning and rolling their eyes at how everything was executed. Children looked like a lot of the ideas were going over their heads and seemed more interested in their bags of sweets and popcorn than what was going on on screen. It was a mix of both with me.\n\nThe best, or shall we say the least bad, thing about 'The Emoji Movie' is the voice cast. Most of the voice actors gave decent performances (James Corden and Patrick Stewart are the liveliest of the bunch), though a few didn't fit their characters (Maya Rudolph has shown that she can voice act with a lot of bubbly personality but she was just wrong here). They did deserve much better however, and should have known much better, didn't think that Stewart could lose more dignity but he managed it in a embarrassingly misconceived character that he gave much more to than deserved.\n\nEverything else comes off badly or worse. There are worse-looking animated films, but the animation never rises above routine, often looking flat and stiff and there is a complete lack of imagination, the colours never popping out at you as they ought like they do from personal experience with \"emojis\". The soundtrack is all noise and no subtlety, and tends to be inappropriate.\n\nWhen it comes to the writing and the story, 'The Emoji Movie' fails. And not just by a little. We are talking hardcore. All the jokes fall flat because of how randomly they tend to be executed and the jokes in quality are juvenile at best and infantile at worst. The script is peppered with dialogue that is overripe and will embarrass even the youngest of cinema goers, when it's not going over their heads. The story, proof that the concept was more of a questionable one than a good one, is not much of one and feels like it was made up as it went along, with the insertion of the likes of Candy Crush, Spotify, Youtube and Facebook being little more than blatant product plugs explored in a mostly throwaway fashion. There are a lot of random and unnecessary scenes and even more so facepalm-worthy moments.\n\nImagination is zero here, with a mishmash of ideas reminiscent of 'Inside Out', 'Wreck It Ralph' and 'The Lego Movie', all three actually being good films (masterpieces in the case of the first two), but without the fun, creativity or emotional investment which are as non-existent as the imagination. The basic theme is a relatable one when done right, but dealt with indifferently. The characters are both bland and annoying, character development is minimal and what there is is rushed.\n\nOverall, a mess. While it is a little better than made out, there is the agreement that the film is a disaster that is more poop than it is meh, despite being the general consensus it seems that this review is not going to be popular when it comes to useful votes. Despite being a subjective person, the excessive non-useful votes for the negative reviews and the up-voting of the positive ones are a little suspicious to me. 2/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "'The Emoji Movie\" is a new children's film. One of the posters for it has a picture of whipped poop on the front of it. Was there a focus group done that says kids really want this?\n\nThis masterpiece takes place inside of some kid's i-phone in a place called Textopolis. Gene is a Meh emoji who just wants to cut loose and show a whole range of emotions, which apparently counts as a malfunction and gets him scheduled for deletion.\n\nNow before you think i'm just going to crap on this movie, know that it is kind of fun for a certain age.\n\nThese killer robots chase Gene and two of his buddies around which always keeps things fast-paced, there's all sorts of promotional tie-ins with Candy Crush, Instagram, and Spotify that while cheap product placement, also are kinda funny and exciting.\n\nLike all kids movies nowadays with fairly weak scripts, there's also a soundtrack filled with dance songs that should have kids dancing in the aisles, and guess what, it's not just stuff from your kids generation but some from yours too.\n\nTake the stuff that's for you where you can cause a lot of the jokes are either literal bores (Internet trolls are trolls, etc.) or center a lot on cartoons having overly cartoony personalities. There's an overly smiley emoji who borders on the psychotic, joyless Meh emojis. This stuff is kinda funny, but the joke is thin.\n\nThen there's the stuff you should expect already going in. Like the jokes centered on the poop emoji, or the Hi-Five emoji saying \"talk to the hand.\" Does anyone say this anymore? It's amazing this movie was co-written by Mike White, writer of \"School of Rock\" and Jennifer Aniston's \"The Good Girl\".\n\nIt's sporadically funny and you can tell it's trying be a kind of \"Wreck It-Ralph\" meets \"Inside Out\" but it's not really inventive enough to be either.\n\nThe kid whose phone this is never really becomes much of a character and probably the funniest part of this movie is that among a plethora of other scattered and unsubtle messages about including everyone and real friends are better than online ones, this also comes with a message of \"be yourself\" told primarily through emojis who want to be more than themselves.\n\nLastly, and for the love of God I hope this was meant as a joke, there are scenes where the emoji is given way too much credit in the scope of love and life in this film. If this is true then it really does go all the way down from here folks.\n\nBut that's \"The Emoji Movie\" in a nutshell. You'll laugh in parts, wanna reach over and tell your kids movies used to be so much better than this in others, and finally, just want to weep for the future.\n\nIf you liked this, please check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more."

While I may also be a teen who spends a lot of her time online, I get off when I need to. The animation is good, but good animation cannot save a bad film from being bad.\n\n\"Oh, but Gal\u00e1n, you're just not part of the film's target audience!\"\n\nI know that, but I'm also not part of the target audience for the films it rips off (Well I was when they came out) and I still enjoy them. Sony cancelled the Popeye movie for this, and the Popeye movie looked like it had more effort put into it, it looked more promising. I luckily didn't have to pay to see it, but to the fellows who rated 1 star and had to pay, I'm sorry.\n\nSo the only things I liked were the animation, and that the teens looked like actual teens rather than twenty-something year olds (while they cast adults to play teens in live-action teen movies, I've seen some animation where the teens still look like adults)."

The majority of the humor is weak and immature, especially with the Poop Emoji. Some of the gags managed to make me chuckle, not laugh but I did find enjoyment. The animation is good, it's colorful and energetic, and there are some creative scenes, even with the product placement scenes. However the designs of the Emojis are really, really simplistic and some are even creepy. The characters are not interesting. Gene is the same old \"I wan't to fit in\" character, and the other characters are also the same old tropes as well. The characters also have their developments presented in the most generic way possible. The characters that stand out for me is the villain and Gene's parents. Mostly because they supply the best comedy and the villain has an this crazy personality that kept me active. The Emoji Movie is a meh film that's suited to entertain kids."

And it is the best film in cinematic history. This film changed my life forever, and it's brilliance is on par with some of the greatest movies of all time like Suicide Squad, or Kangaroo Jack. I will not spoil a single thing about this magnificent movie's existence. But I will tell you that after watching the movie, you will never be the same person again. I finally reached tranquillity and became the happiest being in the whole multi-cosmos because of it. It opened my eyes and made me realise, why are we puny things sitting in our chairs, wasting our lives away, playing Roblox, writing satirical reviews on IMDb about garbage movies, when we can get out of bed in the morning, crack a smile, and say, ''I want to make a movie about Emojis.'' Our puny minds are not capable of developing or putting that thought into action. This proves that The Emoji Movie is a gift from the Gods. A sign that, even in the deepest of hells, there is hope, there is light. I pray to Gene and Hi-5 every night and sleep with my Gene bodypillow. I have an Emoji fidget spinner. I am happy. I am one with the Gods. All hail The Emoji Movie. All hail SONY. Thank you Gene, lord and saviour."

USE OUR PRODUCTS.\n\nThis is a bad movie straight up, but I kinda of wish it was worse. Then it could have turned into 'so bad it's good' kinda film, but sadly this is just a dull, zestless, pointless and oddly confusing movie which is only 1 hour and 31 minutes long but feels like 3 hours staring at a flickering light bulb with this stupid gormless smile. Patrick Stewart voices a poo emoji- do you want a more telling metaphor than that?\n\nThe thing is for a movie about our emoji culture, it seems to hate its very subject matter, it makes fun of all its app related features but never goes full out on them so it's not even a satire of this culture.\n\nAnd of course the product placement is just the worse. There's literally a 10 minute sequence in the Candy Crush world where they play an actual game of Candy Crush. That said the beat moment in this \"movie\" was the Instagram part: the characters could walk into the photo itself and everything is frozen in place which is kinda nice but I've seen that done better in other movies- Looney Tunes: Back in Action did that with actual works of art, with the style of animation mirroring the style of art which is way more creative.\n\nUnsurprisingly this is a bad movie but no where near enough that it's worth any great deal of attention. If you want to see an alright animated movie anytime soon go see Cars 3 it's another Cars movie but that's more entertaining than this 'meh' movie. I give The Emoji Movie a D-\n\n.... But this was also my worst cinema going experience to date- never has the audience reflected the movie so well (they also were just the worst) and for that The Emoji Movie gets demoted to an F"

Half the time I wasn't sure if I wasn't the Emoji Movie, or Wreck-it-Ralph (A far superior film) Don't waste your time on this. The fact that a Popeye movie was canceled for this after the incredible footage released is criminal."

The plot isn't even that clear, and it's hard to understand why anyone's doing anything in the first place. The interactions between characters are weird and unnatural.\n\nBut let's start from the obvious. This film contained two game tutorials and three demonstrations. You can practically see a little four year old thinking about how great Dropbox is as they watch this excuse for a motion picture.\n\nYou would assume a movie to be enjoyable, artistic, original, and funny. The Emoji Movie is none of these things. Absolutely unoriginal - a typical story about someone who doesn't fit in. None of the jokes in this entire movie even made me smile. It is an insult to the arts. When you put all that I have said together, you can assume that it was not enjoyable either.\n\nI beg you not to pay to have one hour and thirty-one minutes of your life wasted."

He must journey through different apps on the phone in order to reach the cloud. On this journey we get to see an imaginative view of what different apps could look like if the were \"real\". It is pretty clever, really. The Emoji Movie is full of humor (the joke about the elderly is HILARIOUS) and it has Steven Wright voicing the main character's father. I think this movie is definitely worth watching if you have kids... They'll love it and I would think the parents would enjoy it too."

So in this boy's phone, there's a city called Textopolis where all emojis live (?) and wait to be picked by that boy. And we follow the emoji that has multiple emotions and he's supposed to be \"meh\". So he wants to kinda cure himself on this journey through all kinds of product placements possible.\n\nAt the same time that boy Alex who owns the phone tries to make her like him with an emoji because I guess emojis and technology are the only way to express your feelings this days, and there's even a quote in this movie about how emojis is the most important form of human communication. I'm not lying, I'm not exaggerating, they said that. It's freaking line from this movie. If you still don't believe me, I don't blame you, just don't try to make sure while seeing it for yourself. You DO NOT need that in your life. You have better things to do with your time. Just imagine something like The Lego Movie, Tron and Inside Out if all of them were one giant cash-grab of a \"movie\". Halfway through, I couldn't even tell if I was watching a movie or a feature-length commercial. With every clich\u00e9 an animated kids movie could possibly fall into. Lead isn't who everyone wants him to be? Check. \"Funny\" sidekick on a journey? Check. Group arguing before the third act starts? Check. A character supposedly dies? Check. A dance sequence to a pop song (possibly by Pitbull)? Check. Only this one isn't even relevant anymore. Wanna know what it is? Well, even if you don't, I just can't resist. It's FEEL THIS MOMENT? GET IT?! BECAUSE THEY ARE EMOJIS AND THEY FEEL THINGS?! Ha, ain't that clever?!\n\nOkay, I don't think I have anything else to say and even if I do, it's probably nothing good. Avoid this and maybe you'll save the movie industry at least a little bit."

After messing up and having the wrong face when he's scanned, Gene sets out on a mission to become a real emoji, and to only be meh.\n\nI personally think that this is a gem of a movie. Of course, it's much less for adults, and any one that's rather anti technology, but this has some serious life lessons in it:\n\n1) Friendship is important\n\n2) Don't bend to society's rules\n\n3) Being you is the best you you can be\n\nThere was nothing I really took from it, of course, as I knew these already, but considering this film is aimed at the technology age of children, this is an absolutely brilliant movie to take your kids to see. Maybe you won't enjoy it, but they definitely will, and it will teach them things along the way.\n\nNot as good as other movies, such as Inside Out, but this is a gem, and it really does have a lot to it, rather than being an annoying movie marketed on a trend."

So I turned on the TV, went to Netflix, and put on The Emoji Movie.\n\nAnd oh BOY does it live up to the level of garbage that everyone says it is. I can't even say much about the entirety of the movie, because I got literally 14 minutes into the movie and already regretted my decision to watch it. It's so unfunny and the \"plot\" (I use that loosely) just doesn't make sense. Also, it has SO MUCH PRODUCT PLACEMENT, including TWO GAME TUTORIALS. IT'S JUST SO BAD. So, 14 minutes in and I said, \"No. I don't want to sit through this anymore. I can't.\", and promptly stopped the movie. It's utter garbage in pretty much every aspect. Please don't waste any of your life watching this cesspool of garbage, you won't enjoy it and the only entertainment you could get out of it is ironic stuff that wasn't meant to be funny in the way it is, and even then it'll only give you a small chuckle.

Two tutorials on how to play games, and many demonstrations of how great phone's apps are. I wasted an hour and thirty-one minutes on my life watching this, when I would much rather have been sitting bored at home.\n\nThe plot was messy and stupid, containing one pathetic joke after the next. The trailer was more entertaining. I will not be surprised if next year, a fidget spinner movie is released.\n\nThis is also offensive to high-school aged students, as the beginning literally states that as a high-school student, Alex's entire life revolves around his phone. Another thing about that is that all they do 24/7 is text, and all they seem to use are emojis. Are the script-writers saying that all a high-school student does throughout the course of their day is press little icons on his phone to send to others?\n\nWhy did people fight over creating this monstrosity? People in the year 3017 are going to look back on July 18, 2017 as the year humanity was at its lowest pitfall. Historians will marvel at how a movie that sucked so much managed to sell even one ticket after opening night.\n\nI want my life back."

It's like watching a YouTube video with mid roll ads that interrupt the video. The plot itself is very common and not nearly as different or interesting enough as many other films with this format. The characters are bland and forgettable since they are literally the same characters as your regular outcast hero characters. If you want to see a good version of this film, watch Wreck It Ralph.

Those are GREAT movies in their genre.\n\nThis is a 5. It held my attention without irritating me, while my 4 year old enjoyed herself.

I know it sounds cheesy but I swear some people just dislike because \"everyone\" else dislikes it too. I am not saying that you have to like or that's the reason why everyone say they dislike I'm just saying try not to be negative. It's a great movie that is nothing more than it needs to be.

        "review_detailed_main": "When I first read the news that there is an animated full-length feature film being developed called \"The Emoji Movie\", I took my hand and forcefully applied it to my forehead. This movie was absolutely uncalled for, yes, we do live in a generation where everyone has a phone or computer and sends each other instant messages, sometimes adding emoticons to reflect their state, but that doesn't justify the need for it. What made sense to pour out $50 million into making this picture? And how come it ended up making over $250 million at the box office? It's beyond comprehension....\n\n\"The Emoji Movie\" centers on a city called Textopolis, which is basically in everyone's smartphone, and the residents of Textopolis are various emojis that have a daily job of making faces and emotions whenever the phone user selects one of them in a text message.\n\nThe main character is Gene Meh, a...\"Meh\" emoji that doesn't like to stick to the norm of one single emotion and is targeted for deletion due to his multi-expressions. He bands up with other malfunctioned emojis in order to escape from the software agents that are hunting them and find the Code to fix Gene. The adventure takes them through various apps like Just Dance, Candy Crush or Instagram. The film is literally a marketing gimmick for phone apps. The fact that Sir Patrick Stewart appears in the film as the Poop emoji had me worried for a bit, but fortunately his appearance is short and minor.\n\nThe animations aren't half-bad, but that's about the only good part of the movie. All the jokes fall flat, there was not a single moment where I actually laughed. Judging by the targeted audience of teens and pre-teens, I expected to have more triumph over toys and merchandise, but it didn't really pick up.\n\n\"The Emoji Movie\" is a film that shouldn't have been made and instead should have invested the budget into something else."

And, considering I love to occasionally watch an awful film in order to get a good laugh, I decided to finally see this piece of dreck. Overall, it was a terrible movie but perhaps not as terrible as I expected. It ended up being more tedious than painful to watch.\n\nSo what's wrong with this movie? The writing. Despite the film being all about emojis, the writers managed to hit every possible cliche a kids movie could use. And, considering these are emojis, it just didn't make sense to stick so close to a rather overused formula. Additionally, the film had what seemed like hundreds of jokes relating to computers and social media....and each and every one of them fell flat. And, several of these 'jokes' involved the poop emoji. This is because in none of these was there even a hint of humor or cleverness.\n\nI noticed one review where the reviewer gives this one a 10. That's like saying that a velvet Elvis painting belongs in the Louvre!"

Shoutout to the animation team for at least trying to make this movie have any redeeming qualities. -There is like, two or three good ideas\n\nCons: -Even without all of the other cons, this movie would've still been a predictable, unoriginal, cliched, boring, and forgettable piece of (poop emoji) -The writing is INFURIATINGLY awful. I had to pause the movie so many times to let the stupidity sink in. -The \"jokes\", if you can call them that, are all either bad visual gags or awful \"puns\" that don't even make sense half of the time. There were a few times when I was a little close to laughing, and two times when I genuinely laughed, but the rest of it is garbage. -This movie has some of the worst product placement I have ever seen. They weren't trying to be even a little subtle, it just felt like I was watching a big ad for a bunch of apps, with an awful movie in between the ads. -The characters are bad. Gene is just an uninteresting \"meh\" protagonist. High-five is very annoying, and I don't buy his friendship with Gene at all. He just seemed to tag along on the adventure for his own personal gain that I didn't care about. Jailbreak is a somewhat boring character who randomly spouts out feminist remarks from time to time, and does some EXTREMELY out of character things near the end of the movie. Again, I don't buy her relationship with Gene, but at least it isn't the most forced in relationship I've ever seen. -This movie doesn't seem to have rules. Here are some examples (minor spoilers): \"He is going to go to the phone store to delete us tomorrow!\" After what seems like a few minutes in the movie's time: \"We only have 4 hours before the phone is deleted!\" \"We have to travel to the other side of the phone to get to the trash to save High Five from being deleted!\" Later: \"Here, I can pull up this email you found and left in the trash on my screen.\" Not to mention, a large amount of things that happen in the movie are just not how phones work at all. Also, many plot holes and things that didn't make sense were created just to throw in more ads. -There were some subplots, but I din't care at all about them. At least they were breaks from the infuriating main plot -The voice acting is sub-standard\n\nI know there are worse movies out there, but this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Don't watch this ad that is calling itself a movie. It is not so bad it's good, it's just infuriating, and it will be forgotten within a year or two."

But that's OK, that's actually how it relates to the audience that know each app on our smartphone, and you use them everyday. And that's actually what makes it interesting and compelling. How could a movie about your phone be with fake names and fake apps, it wouldn't make sense.\n\nHowever, the action felt like they were just passing each level, from one app to the other until the final destination. And it's not that funny, but it has some nice funny lines that make you smile (but not laugh). My kid laughed a bit with the easy jokes.\n\nPositive points for the animation, liked the Instagram bit especially for the really nice 3D feel.\n\nDespicable Me 3 is funnier. Cars 3 is more adventurous. But Emoji relates more to the audience and to the real life."

The handful of jokes in the movie are mostly pop-culture references and poop jokes--most of which will probably sail right over kids' heads--and overly predictable gags throughout. Even then, the jokes that do remain aren't particularly funny: a donut's babies parodying that cereal from \"See Spot Run\" and that's it, or one of the characters quotes a line from Pulp Fiction during what's supposed to be a sad moment.\n\nFor adults, I definitely don't see the appeal. Besides the trite jokes, the plot is so predictable and irritating that it grates on one's nerves. There is a -bit- of redemption with being able to hear Patrick Stewart and James Cordon's voices, but their lines are so awful that it just begs the question of what possessed them to bother with The Emoji Movie in the first place. Beyond that, the characters themselves are very flat, all of which have stock personalities, and there is absolutely zero development of any of them, not even to reflect the 'moral of the story'.\n\nThere is no highlight to this movie whatsoever. It's not even worth a Netflix rental. Avoid it altogether and save yourself the 85 minutes. KF."

        "review_detailed_main": "To be honest, I saw The Emoji Movie only to understand why it gets so much hate. As a Redditor I understand why I am supposed to hate this movie (because...emojis?), but why does the normie audience hate it? Isn't this movie supposed to be like, their dream come true? Don't they always keep spamming emojis in all their sentences when writing a message or making a meme? When the movie hadn't come out it was being advertised a lot, so I thought people are supposed to be excited. Even the animation of this movie seemed really good. But I watched it and now I know the problem.\n\nThe Emoji Movie is very ignorant. It talks about emojis as if it is supposed to be something very cool. In reality only elders, women and children use emojis when they message (because they are the only ones we can't slap some sense into). But then again the target audience here is the children. So considering this movie is from their point of view, emojis are supposed to be shown as though they mean a lot to them. So let's come to the second point. The emojis are shown to have their entire personality revolving around their expression. Why can't they just be doing their job? Also how come so many emojis look similar? Is it like only one of them goes to the emoji keyboard while the others have no business? There are so many questions that the movie doesn't answer.\n\nI don't know which problem plagues this movie the most. Is it the product placement? No, it just gives a feeling of adventure. None of the product placement looks as much on the nose as everyone describes. Like in TVF Originals they straight up speak out to advertise the things. Here at least Gene and Hi-5 are going to those places to see what is happening over there. I kinda found the Candy Crush part funny and relaxing at the same time. There was also the Just Dance part, and that was definitely cringy. But that was the only cringy one. Facebook, Skype, Drop Box - everything else was quite decent.\n\nThe jokes weren't half as bad, considering this is aimed for kids. Even I used to make many poop jokes when I was 13. If there even was anything bad, the animation and music compensated for it. The idea that there are so many emojis that we can establish and entire world using it is actually something I'm guessing everyone must have thought at some point. The one part that I surely felt was cringy was when the kid gets to ask out his crush because he sent her a custom emoji. Only if life functioned that easily. Hi-5 was also pretty disgusting. Every time he kept his hand (thumb) down it used to hurt me. Imagine bending your thumb down that much. Also when he ate the salivated candy I felt like vomiting.\n\nThe Emoji Movie is a bad movie, yes, but it's still better than many animated movies I have seen. Food Fight, Delhi Safari, Roadside Romeo, Geng: The Adventure Begins, Pangaa Gang, the entire Super Bheem series - there are plenty of examples of animated movies that are even worse than this. It does have redeeming qualities, even if they are not enough to make this a genuinely good movie. I can imagine the animators must have worked hard on this movie even if they didn't agree with the script. And that is the reason why I have massive respect for them."

Producers have clearly become so dreadfully boring that they had to capture the joy and excitement of communication through technology, and turn it into a complete disappointment.\n\nThe characters are completely unrealistic and have no real humour or personality. If you want to produce a movie based on emoji's every day lives, at least make it a little interesting, a movie is to be enjoyed, not to be dreaded. The main character Gene, is frankly pathetic! What do you mean he can't pull a 'meh' facial expression, that's why he exists? And that's his parent's function too. Also the main antagonist?! Explain to me, WHY is she a 'smiley face' emoji but the villain? This completely changes humanities perspective, how are we expected to go on and use this emoji when this awful movie has shaped the smiley face as a negative image? I will never use it again. No one should honour this disgrace of filmography.\n\nMy friend recommended this to me and whilst I displayed my hatred, he told me to trust the process... But I will never trust him again.\n\nThis movie is an utter nightmare, I may need to dispose of all technology after this chaotic kerfuffle! When I sleep, emoji shaped demons form in my head due to the nonsense I have witnessed!\n\nI would not recommend this shallow and meaningless movie to anyone, not even innocent children. Absolutely nobody would find this exciting.\n\nThis movie was a reality check for me, I know now to research beforehand and know my self-worth before watching mere junk. Please do not waste time on this piece of rubbish.\n\nThis movie is not art, but it is a lifeless void.\n\nIf this movie were to be wiped off the face of the earth... I concur!"

The characters are so one dimensional that I only needed to see the extended movie trailer to know the motivations and personalities of each character. There is the main character, going about his life until one day, he messes up his job and needs to climb back up to his position where he could save the day. On the way, he has a love interest with a troubled past, the idiotic sidekick that means well and tries to help the main character but just gets in the way. There is the Den of Deplorables where the scum and the forgotten reside. Then, there is the constant \"threat\" overhanging the world that has the possibility of destroying their community if the character does not hurry up. Then there is an impenetrable obstacle in the way that blocks the character's path of least resistance. Finally, there is the scene where the love interest and main character go through a beautiful scene where they both learn that there is a meaning to life (for example, look at Wall-e.) Finally, the main character gets the girl, solves the problem, and everyone is saved. It is the most carbon copy coming-of-age story imaginable.\n\nDon't see this movie. Not even ironically. Do not give these people any money."

The B plot revolves around a freshman named Alex who tries to get the attention of Addie McCallister by sending her emojis...\n\nWhen I first found out about this movie I thought it was a joke. I just thought it was an April Fools Day prank pulled by Sony, but when the trailer for this movie arose in December, I feared for the worst...\n\nI don't even know where to begin. Let's start with the A plot. You may notice that it sounds really familiar, and it does. It sounds like the plot of Wreck-It Ralph. Just from the second trailer I knew that we would get a Wreck-It Ralph vibe. That's essentially what the concept of the A plot is. It's like they took the concept of warping from world to world presented in that movie and put it in a smartphone. The movie doesn't even go in-depth into what Gene's condition is. It just tells you that Gene can express multiple emotions and expect you to roll with it. All that does is bring analytic viewers to question the ideas of the movie. When it comes to the A plot though, it's just linear, predictable and unpleasant to sit through.\n\nHi-5 is a pointless character. All he does is act as the comic relief, and he even fails at that, as he didn't make me laugh once throughout the picture. The jokes in this movie are all cringeworthy. None of them hit. There were kids in the theater who hardly laughed at all, that's how bad these jokes were. There was only one joke that made me laugh and even that one will eventually become dated.\n\nThe product placement is incredibly annoying. Throughout the movie we see many different real world apps like YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and even Candy Crush. I just felt cheap looking at these and many parts of the movie felt like advertisements for smartphone apps. They even try to be \"cool and hip\" with the kids. There is modern slang usage, movie references and even references to songs that went viral two to three years ago. For example, they play the Nae Nae song by Silento in hopes that kids in the audience can relate. You're not relating to your audience, you're pandering to them. It's not like in Wreck-It Ralph, for instance, where they bring in classic video game icons for viewers to relate to. The difference of bringing these different products in is that the classic video game icons are timeless, while the Nae Nae song became dated.\n\nThere's also a sub-plot that I won't spoil that feels so pointless, and I say this for two reasons. One, the movie only cuts to that part twice. Second, the characters involved in said plot point don't get anywhere new.\n\nAs for the B plot, it's probably the best part of this entire film, which isn't saying anything. The characters outside the smartphone are boring, but at least they're not annoying like the emojis. The animation for those scenes looks pretty good for the most part. Even saying that the B plot is the best part isn't saying much. Even the way that plot ends feels predictable.\n\nIf you are a kid who is really into emojis, chances are that you will enjoy this film. Even at that, I don't think anyone else would enjoy it, just small kids to early teenagers. It's a terrible animated feature that's down there with Norm of the North that's unfunny, linear, empty, full of product placement and is just awful.\n\n2/10"

The worst part about this movie is that at one point, a group of executives sat together in a board room and thought, \"What's something hip and cool that kids like?\" and they all collectively agreed that and EMOJI movie would be the best idea.\n\nAt one point I was in the middle of watching this and I came to the sad realization that I was watching a movie about EMOJIS. Overall, this movie was a sad attempt at trying to keep up with the times, and I hope that this is a Hollywood's final attempt at trying to do something like this."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hoping to see any redeeming qualities of this movie's very negative buzz, can't say I was able to when I did. The animation quality, visual setting, and adding a few real-life app names looks inviting on the outside, but upon entering its world and inner workings, it was a waste and abysmal to take seriously as a \"movie.\" As though it poorly replicated Pixar's Inside Out concept crossed with the technological theme of Disney's Wreck-It Ralph.\n\nI've seen plenty of animated features as both a kid and as an adult, but this is one you'd probably not want to see at a movie theater. It's pretty much a desperate, by-the-numbers cash grab done by all things Sony Animation, who had produced a few SO much better animated titles in the past.\n\nIn the city of Textopolis, an emoji called Gene (T.J. Miller) is designed to be like his parents (both \"meh\" icons), but for some reason he has multiple ways of expressing himself in the smartphone of young teen Alex that it confuses those around him and his own user. Hoping to find his place, he goes on an adventure with female emoji hacker Jailbreak (Anna Faris) to have a true purpose in his user's data space.\n\nDirector Tony Leondis said he was greatly inspired by Toy Story's concept, but his approach in using that for emojis doesn't work if the story squanders it with a predictable ending and difficult-to-like, cardboard characters. Other films that used the concept like say, Wreck-It Ralph and The LEGO Movie had a premise and morals that weren't questionable or inane. No. Instead, those movies emitted both the mythos and pathos in an intriguing and creative way. I don't blame the movie's voice cast at all for this mistake, it's the \"story\" that was unoriginal and a hodgepodge, including jokes that were too juvenile to find as funny.\n\nOverall, this'll attract the littler ones, but this flick is best suited as direct-to-DVD, not theater worthy."

        "review_title": "An Icon Of Lost Potential: A Serious Review of The Emoji Movie",
        "review_detailed_main": "In today's world, the phone isn't used quite as the inventors pictured, with actual calling being replaced by texting and snapchat. But one item has been developed to replace the words that are too difficult to write: Emojis. In desperation, Sony has developed a film about these icons in an attempt to break the bank with another hit animated series. Can they succeed, or will this movie be nothing but a bombardment of sad faced emojis? Robbie K here to answer that question for you with another review.\n\nLIKES:\n\nThe Animation: You can say a lot of negative things about the movie, but one plus for this reviewer is the beautiful display Sony's team has designed. Like many movies, the characters move with fluid grace, transitioning through their adventure with little jumpiness. High Five (James Corden) in particular has impressive moves, as having a hand expand beyond simple hand movements can be tricky business. In addition, I enjoyed the visualization of the world within our phone, finding clever design in the development of the internal universes of each app (primarily Instagram's frozen pictures). I'll admit, the characters aren't realistic like Pixar, or even super creative design, but there is cleverness in the world itself.\n\nIt's Cute: When it comes to cartoons/animated marvels, the pendulum can swing to either side of the age spectrum. Fear not those with little kids, this movie is certainly geared towards the younger side, filled to the brim with color, simplistic jokes, and over the top slapstick that will make many giggle. Sure, there are a few drier jokes that adults will get, but for the most part this movie goes back to basics for family friendliness. One won't have to worry about inappropriate gestures or innuendos in this film.\n\nThe Morals: Movies are a powerful tool to teach the lessons we humans are too ignorant to learn from mentors, school, and the quickly fading trend of reading. Emoji's movie solid lesson of being yourself and not conforming to the traditional ways is as good rehash of the traditional lesson. Those who stand out from the norm will find great relevance to Gene (T.J. Miller) and Jailbreak's (Anna Faris) quest and most likely grab on to the characters. It's also always good to see a lesson in friendship as well, quoting the movie as \"Better to have one good friend, than a bunch of fake fans followers\". The strong emphasis on this will hopefully break through the persistent firewalls of your subconscious and get you contacting your buddies.\n\nDISLIKES:\n\nStory: Despite the morals infused into the story, the overall quality of Gene's tale is very basic at best. The Emoji movie has little sustenance to it, diving more into cramming the jokes in the short run time. After all the world building I had hoped for a little more depth to navigating the apps, facing the dangers of the cyber terror that lurk in our phones. I wanted suspense! I wanted exploration of a selection of apps. I wanted an adventure that had a little more depth behind it. I got very little of that. All the obstacles they faced were fairly easy to circumvent, and often not worth mentioning at how lame they were. Certainly, they did a few things right (Just Dance 4), but for the most part, it was a huge loss of potential at decoding the craziness of our obsession with phones.\n\nHumor: Humor can be fun when balanced, but unfortunately Emoji movie lacks that balance, once again swinging the pendulum to the younger audience. Most of the jokes are very simple statements that lack any finesse, or decent delivery to maximize the laughs. Much of the humor is dry, and although has adult components, lacks that clever zing that other films/programs do. James Corden rectifies this a little with High Fives self-absorbed personality, but even his banter gets stale after a while. With all of the comedians in this movie, I really had expected more of this movie, but again missed potential.\n\nBoring: If you haven't gleamed it from the first two categories, then this should sum this up, Emoji movie is boring. There is no suspense to the adventure, and let's face it no point, to the challenges at hand. I found myself looking at the clock wondering how much longer I had in the ridiculous presentation of smart phone gimmicks. Cute is always great, but it is better left to YouTube and Kid shows that are in short spans of time. Without the jokes to back it up, nor an impressive voice performance, there is just little to scream entertainment outside of watching a child's smile light up at the colorful presentation.\n\nThe VERDICT:\n\nYou've seen the reviews of my colleagues, and they aren't far from the truth\u0085 Emoji movie was a miss for Sony in terms of quality. The lackluster jokes, lack of challenge, and reserved wit were not the right steps to take in this inconsistent adventure for success. In fact, the best thing of this film is the animated short for Hotel Transylvania that precedes it. Still, if you are looking for a safe, family trip to the movies, you've got the Emoji movie to save your bacon. However, I highly recommend reserving this one for Netflix.\n\nMy scores are:\n\nAnimation/Adventure/Comedy: 4.0 Movie Overall: 2.0"

Emoji movie is about the imaginary world inside your phone, so they used several widely-used apps throughout the movie to transport us through this phone world. It's not entirely unclever. It was kind of enjoyable to see some of these familiar apps from a different perspective. Don't set your expectations too high, it's not a Pixar, but the animation is good and the story watchable."

To make a movie about Legos or Transformers or My Little Pony is one thing, but making an entire movie about the text app on your phone is the equivalent of making a movie called The Secret Life of Smoke Signals. The fact that the movie centers on the \"\ud83d\ude15\" emoji is, in a way, kind of ironic. \"\ud83d\ude15,\" is quite literally the best thing you can say about this movie. The worst you can say, is it made this reviewer want to \ud83e\udd22.\n\nThe (ugh) Emoji Movie follows a few days in the life of Gene Meh (Miller), an Emoji who for some reason doesn't have the ability to do a \"Meh\" on cue. As a result of a first day screw up, Gene becomes a social pariah and risks deletion unless he can find a code that will change his programming for the better...I guess. Along for the ride is former user favorite High-Five (Corden), and the mysterious Hacker named Jailbreak (Farris) who isn't who she says she is but her big, third act reveal means little, and does little other than prop up a cynical Twitter ad.\n\nTo the surprise of absolutely no one, The Emoji Movie is chalked full of low-hanging fruit when it comes to jokes and basic story elements. But what is surprising is there's so little of anything actually going on. For real though! In between page long exposition dumps, plot contrivance dumps and forced, cringe-worthy youth-oriented vocab dumps, the jokes seem to be spewing at 30% capacity and the plot seems barely alive. It's essentially a movie of surface level dynamics and empty space.\n\nWhat little we have to grab onto in this godforsaken movie is Meh's ambiguously set up heroes journey. A journey that literally takes him, his friends and his family through Facebook, Youtube, Spotify and Dropbox because, you know, what's a movie like this without cat videos, malware updates, bad pop music and \"thumbs up\" stickers. There's also a trek through Candy Crush which not only feels uninspired but does the unthinkable in taking a beat to actually explain the game lest someone in the audience still holds onto their rotary. It all reaches peak stupidity when Meh manages to travel to \"the cloud\" thanks largely to his ability to make faces and remember the name of the girl the phone's user is obsessed with.\n\nThe final act makes no sense but trust me, by the point Meh makes his return to Textopolis (no joke, the Emojis live in Textopolis), the movie is so far gone, you'll just be glad it's a few minutes from wrapping up. When it finally does wrap up the only question you'll probably be asking yourself is, \"am I angry that I saw this movie, or am I just angry that it wasted my time?\" With a threadbare story and failing significantly to reach already low expectations, The Emoji Movie is arguably the worst movie of the summer. And this is the same summer that brought us the The Mummy (2017) and that's say something! Everything it does has been done before and better, and what it manages to do differently is so cynically implemented and poorly thought out. This isn't a movie, it's a tweet that's grown sentient."

It's child-safe and it has some easter eggs in it. Par example: the chase in Shrek with that dragon that gets entangled in her own chains. I always enjoy it when people put easter eggs like that in their movie. So this is my conclusion: if you're ill and too tired to watch more complicated movies, this is kind of nice. Just keep a vomit bucket with you for during the ending scene. That scene was just too sweet."

Basically, It is just the worst movie ever made in the century, heck, it even made \"Foodfight!\" look like \"The Lion King\"! It's a good thing I haven't seen this movie in theaters. But hey, That is just my opinion, So whatever you do, if there is one film, or many films, you need to watch, Please, PLEASE avoid this one. This movie is just one big Sir Patrick Stewart-fest."

The movie is so bland and generic, and cheesy, and illogical, seriously they bombed. See Sony, this is karma for screwing over Spider-Man and all relating characters for the past few years. Next time, stick with a Popeye movie.\n\nNow, this review Is just my rant about how much I wanted it to fail. But if I were to put a REAL review in, it'd be this: This is one of the most clich\u00e9 movies of all time. Its like Sony looked at things like Wreck it Ralph and Finding Dory, and just straight up copied it. But made it worse. The characters are bland, the story is bland, and all the comedy fails. STAY AWAY FROM THIS MESS.\n\nAnd Patrick Stewart, what are you doing here in this mess? You're better than this, man. Cmon. Poop? Really?"

        "review_detailed_main": "When it was first announced, I thought that the emoji movie was just some elaborate April fools prank. Clearly, I was wrong. This film was a steaming pile of human waste. It was a pandering, clich\u00e9 mess of a movie that makes \"The Room\" look like a masterpiece. To be frank, I only watched the emoji movie because I was expecting it to be so bad that it was actually comical. Unfortunately, this movie's horrific nature is due to the immense blandness of the plot, the characters, the visuals. The plot is full of clich\u00e9s, as are the characters. Each character is one dimensional and lacks nuance. Even the main character, Gene, is made to be a nuanced character who breaks the mold. However, he ends up being a one dimensional rest like everyone else. The visuals are uninspired. Every frame is full of colors, but frankly, the vibrancy just makes everything look like a can of children's medicines. Now would be an appropriate time to to make an analogy: Assume the Emoji Movie is a blank canvas, it is basic, pandering and clich\u00e9. Assume the Room is a child's drawing. A child's drawing, although inherently bad, is still more valuable than a blank canvas. The former is personal and is something that the child worked hard to make. The latter can be bought at a store and was built by a machine. In essence, the Emoji movie was made by a machine, made in a formulaic way. It lacks emotion, subtlety, or nuance. If you have a few hours on your hands, don't watch this film, watch something that was made by an artist, or even a generic human. Or even something made by yourself."

In film industry, marketing is notorious, there are times that it works, and sometimes you are hoping to die while seeing the film. The LEGO movie did an amazing job promoting a product but Emojis aren't even a product, there are only faces that actually doesn't have a story, they are only representing emotions, so this could have been the big problem to this movie being a piece of s***. The characters in this movie are stereotyped and don't make any sense for example the main character is the one that is consent of what they are doing and have some moral, then there is a friend of the main character is the typical stupid that doesn't help with anything. The story is the worst, seriously WTF, is an story that we saw a lot of times, the typical things that you use every day have a secret life OMG i never saw that premise (Toy Story, A bugs life, Secret life of pets). But the worst of this film are the jokes, is the wanna be bizarre we saw in LEGO movie but bad executed. Conclussion: Don't give money to this piece of s***, if you want to see it download it by torrent. But even if this movie was free i wouldn't watch it mother of god what a bad experience."

I however said NO, i won't believe the movie is that bad, so i went to see it anyway.\n\nIt's a movie about a Emoji that is not like everyone else but wants to fit in so badly(kind of remind me of The Lego Movie). When he messes up the the chat with the wrong emoji all hell breaks loose. There is a lot of fun moments and uses the actual apps, that many know an love. If you have any know how on the net you know characters like trolls and alike. It even have a great message for us and the kids(unlike Planes...).\n\nI can't see how this movie is in the garbage bin, and maybe it's the message of the movie that people lost.

This may not be Kung-Fu Panda or The Incredibles, but it sure isn't a three star animated movie. :) Yes the animation is \"emoji\" (average) style but then again it kind of adds to the feeling of the movie. Pros - short and fast paced (not a minute dragged), quite original concept of the \"phone world\", has the expected friends&family values you expect from a teenage oriented movie, AND you'll have a constant smile on your face. Cons - may be a bit predictable (yet not boring), some parts sound like a commercial indeed and aimed at teenagers (pro or con, depending on your age). Overall, an amusing movie well worth your time. Great for some afternoon relaxing time."

The characters are bland, the story is clich\u00e9, and the villain is basically like every other clich\u00e9 villain. The entire movie just felt like a Wreck It Ralph rip off with emojis instead of popular video game characters. The jokes were not funny at all and there was WAY to much toilet humor in this that even a 7 year old kid who likes toilet humor would be annoyed by it. They listed this movie as \"comedy\" even though literally nobody laughed in the theater I was watching it in, not even some kids. Parents, spare your children from wasting 86 minutes of their life and go do something else with that time. This movie deserves to become a box office bomb and is not worth watching."

        "review_detailed_main": "\ud83d\udca9\n\nJust by writing this review, I probably spent more time on The Emoji Movie than anyone involved with the script. I'm concerned that by calling this a garbage fire, I'll be doing an injustice to garbage fires. This movie sounded like an inane idea when announced, looked terrible in the trailers, nonetheless surprised me by being worse than I expected. If you can envision a place where creativity goes to die this is it. It represents all the worst elements of Sony as a studio and of Hollywood in general.\n\nRemember \"Inside Out\" from a couple of years ago? Did you ever imagine what it would be like if that movie replaced all it's imagination with product placement? That's \"The Emoji Movie\" in a nutshell: \"Inside Out\" sans soul.\n\nOur main character, Gene (T.J. Miller),is the son of two \"meh\" emojis (Steven Wright and Jennifer Coolidge) and he too is meant to be a \"meh\". Sadly,if this movie were \"meh\" it would be a vast improvement. He's not a very good \"meh\" and expresses pretty much every emotion except \"meh\". Because of this, the smiley in charge decides he should be deleted. To escape, he runs off into other phone apps. Remember all the interesting locations the character went through in \"Inside Out\", well here each of those locations is nothing more than a product placement. Gene and Hi-5 (James Corden), who gets caught up in the \"adventure\", go to Let's Dance, Candy Crush, Spotify, YouTube, all in an attempt to get to the cloud aka Dropbox. These side quests exist solely to sell products. Sony outpaces other studios in its use of product placement and cross promotion. Thus, \"The Emoji Movie\" serves as a vehicle for Sony Products and nothing more. Honestly, with all the advertisers featured in this movie it probably paid for itself before one film cell existed.\n\nI would say the story is bland and predictable, but in truth it's borderline nonexistent. I wouldn't say it's predictable because that would require an interest in the story's future events when I had none. Literally, I could find nothing to praiseworthy about this movie. Even Patrick Stewart as the Poop emoji never had a chance. What was supposed to pass as humor fell flat. Even when journeying to the separate app, the film's lack of creativity overwhelms everything else. To date, \"The Emoji Movie\" is the frontrunner for worst movie of the year."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Emoji Movie\" is Hollywood's next attempt to make anything a \"thing.\" The Emoji movie is about a meh emoji who may have a malfunction and some other stuff happens along the way. I don't really know. And I don't really care.\n\nThe thing with animated movies is that you have to make them appealing to both kids and adults. This was neither. Adults will be bored with it, but at least kids will have fun right? Wrong. When the kid next to me is asleep a half hour into the movie and the girl in front of me leans over to her mother and asks \"Mom is the movie over yet,\" that is a problem within itself.\n\nThere are so many bad attempts at humor in this film. The \"poop emoji\" is there for the poop jokes and there are other characters that have bad puns. Apparently this is what quailifies as humor now. It wasn't funny. I didn't laugh once throughout the entirety of the runtime.\n\nAnd the second half of this film is just a music video. Song after song plays, you see emojis dancing, and the movie stops taking itself seriously. Not like it ever did in the first place anyways. I just never thought a movie would be dumb enough to make it self a music video again after Suicide Squad did that.\n\nThis movie loses your interest almost immediately. Movies like this have to be fun, entertaining, and interesting. There were so many scenes in this film where I was drifting off thinking about my next day's activities.\n\nThis is worse than Transformers 5. Sadly almost as bad as Fifty Shades Darker.\n\nI am going to give \"The Emoji Movie\" a fat F, which is equivalent to the Poop emoji.\n\nCheck out my review here on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXA2cj6_bnw&t=1s"

        "review_detailed_main": "Most people would be surprised to learn how much more there is to the emoji phenomenon than little digital icons which we use to express emotion or represent activities or locations in our text messages. For instance, did you know that the word emoji has nothing to do with the words emotion or emoticon? Emoji is a combination of the Japanese words for \"picture\" and \"character\". Emojis started appearing on Japanese cell phones in the late 1990s. When they began showing up in the U.S. on the Apple iPhone in 2011, soon followed by other smart phones, emojis truly became a global phenomenon. So much so that there's even an annual World Emoji Day \u2013 and an international organization which regulates emojis!\n\nJuly 17th is World Emoji Day because that's the date the calendar emoji shows, but every day is emoji day for the non-profit Unicode Consortium. According to a July 16, 2017 \"USA Today\" article, \"The Unicode Emoji Subcommittee determines which characters will become part of the official emoji lexicon, creating a uniform code that can be used across platforms.\" The article also says that the consortium, which has been around since 1988, is striving to be more inclusive and representative when it comes to race, gender and sexual orientation, pointing out that, at press time, there were 2,666 approved emojis.\n\nOf course, the business and regulatory aspects of emojis don't matter to the people who send the 6 billion emoji-enhanced text messages worldwide every single day. They're just looking for a more complete way to express themselves digitally, to add a little emotional context to their messages. More than just being \"cute\", emojis help us communicate more effectively in our increasingly digital world. And with emojis increasingly prevalent in our daily text messages and Emails, is it any wonder that they would make their way onto movie screens too? And we get just that with the animated adventure comedy \"The Emoji Movie\" (PG, 1:26) bringing to \"life\" those little yellow faces and other digitized objects in the summer of 2017, less than two weeks after the 4th (yes, 4th) annual World Emoji Day.\n\nAlex (voiced by Jake T. Austin from the Disney Channel's \"Wizards of Waverly Place\") is a typical teenager. He doesn't like school, but he does like a girl in his school, a pretty young lady named Addie (Tati Gabrielle). Of course, he tries to communicate with her through his smart phone, but he finds it difficult \u2013 because he's shy, but also because his phone seems to have a mind of its own these days. Little does Alex know, but inside his phone is a virtual city called Textopolis, which is where emojis live and work. The job of all the emojis is to stand by for Alex to call upon them in a text message and, when chosen, to present their best individual image as he or she is scanned for a digital text transmission.\n\nGene (T.J. Miller) is excited and nervous because this is his first day on the job as an emoji \u2013 the \"meh\" emoji. His parents, Mr. & Mrs. Meh (Steven Wright and Jennifer Coolidge), aren't sure he's ready, but he assures them that he is and he takes his position in his cube, waiting to be chosen to appear in a text message. When Alex chooses the meh emoji for a text to Addie, Gene freaks out during his scan, causing Alex to embarrass himself by sending Addie a very odd-looking emoji that she doesn't understand. Gene's mistake causes Smiler (Maya Rudolph), the head emoji, to label Gene a \"malfunction\" and order that he be deleted. Gene makes a run for it and Smiler sends menacing black bots after him.\n\nGene's \"problem\" is that he feels and expresses more emotions than meh. Now, besides being frustrated that he can't just be the meh that he was born to be, he has endangered the entire emoji community. If Alex thinks there's something wrong with his phone, he may just have it wiped clean. Hoping to get \"fixed\", Gene teams up with the hand emoji Hi-5 (James Corden), who is upset that he's no longer in the Favorites Lounge, and the two of them go in search of a hacker named Jailbreak (Anna Faris). Jailbreak is uninterested in helping them until she sees that Gene can show multiple emotions. She decides to help them get to a magical place called The Cloud where all of them may find the solutions to their problems. As the three emojis work their way through Alex's phone (while trying to steer clear of the bots), they cause various apps to malfunction, making even more problems for Alex.\n\n\"The Emoji Movie\" is derivative and not very enjoyable. The story, directed and co-written by Tony Leondis (\"Lilo & Stitch: Stitch Has a Glitch\") is a combination of \"Inside Out\", \"Toy Story\", \"Divergent\" and \"The Wizard of Oz\", but not nearly as good as any of them. The script finds many opportunities for humor in actual cell phone usage and the emojis that \"live\" in them, but the movie just isn't all that funny. There are positive lessons about the bonds of friendship and being the best version of yourself regardless of what others think, but those ideas have been portrayed more effectively by countless other movies before this one. \"The Emoji Movie\" is clever enough, but entertaining? Not enough. \"C\""

Yeah, the plots is a bit predictable and borrows heavily from other kids CGI movies like Wreck it Ralph and other kids fare. It has its moments and had me chuckling from time to time with its somewhat dry humor which is my kind of humor. All the product placement didn't bother me (which is what I think a lot of people really don't like) but I'm fine with it since it tends to bring us closer with the real world. It's not a 'great' movie but it's cute family movie overall. Even my teen daughter even got into it after hearing how bad it was and liked it. Never judge a movie by its 1 star reviews...."

Its about the same kind of level as any of a dozen direct to DVD 'specials' I've seen this year.\n\nIts basically a budget retread of the lego movie. Emojis try to escape from a smartphone by crossing through apps on the homescreen to get to 'the cloud' which they will access via dropbox. Some of the product placement is fairly crass but no worse than the lego movie and not as bad as many reviews I've read have implied. The characters get trapped in versions of candy crush and lets dance. Quite a lot of it is negative to the apps themselves (ie facebook) and i was surprised a key feature of the story was a 'pirate' app called 'jailbreak'.\n\nIts a kids movie, my kids (4 and 7) enjoyed it though one jump scare did get to my 4 year old (a robot unexpectedly grabs a character and snatches them off screen). They enjoyed it, as did the majority of the audience. Only one family left early and thats not unusual in a family screening. I've only ever fallen asleep during one movie in my life (wesley snipes the art of war). This is infinitely better than that movie and that movie gets 5.7? Go figure."

        "review_detailed_main": "Honestly, this movie is probably the worst I've ever seen. The whole idea is creative and could've been such an amazing movie but it was lacking a lot of things, like the plot and dialogue. The visuals, characters and setting was terrific. It was visually appealing and all the apps and emojis were very imaginative and well done, but the dialogue was cringe and the plot was confusing. A lot of it didn't make sense, and the good parts of the movie sadly don't make up for the bad. I don't think this is a suitable movie for young kids as it involves social media and a lot of other things that only teens would understand but it is a pretty lame movie for older kids and adults. Don't waste your time and money on it!"

I think it is mostly for kids but I don't see a reason why the whole family couldn't watch it together. I guess, if you're looking for something extraordinary or super clever, then it's probably not for you but if you just want to watch a fun animated movie with your kids, there's no reason not to enjoy it."

The graphics are beautiful, and the voice acting is spectacular. The music isn't the best, but it's still decent.\n\nThey got great animators, actors, and composers to make this movie. So why was it so bad?\n\nIn a word, the writers.\n\nI don't know what the people who scripted this thing were thinking. The plot is just so terrible, there are no words.\n\nThe main issue with the plot is how utterly cliche it is. If you think about it, this movie is basically the Lego Movie, but with all the minifigures replaced by emojis.\n\nThe Lego movie really was a good movie, but this movie stole it's plot, removed all the exciting scenes, severely diluted the antagonist, and basically turned it into garbage.\n\nOccasionally, the movie will throw in a good joke. Some of them are actually pretty funny and witty. That's the main upside. If nothing else, it will occasionally make you laugh.\n\nBut all of that aside, as a hardcore fan of Michael Jackson, there is one element of this movie that I do find offensive: Hi-Five claiming he can dance as good as \"Michael\" and putting on a Smooth Criminal Style fedora, then immediately proceeding to dance terribly. As a fan of Michael Jackson, I hate this scene for that one reason."

        "review_detailed_main": "Contrary to many unbelievable online reviews, this movie is quite trash. If, in the future, the human race were to look back at our past achievements and judge whether or not we were on the right track, they'd most likely assume we were in the dark ages again, only this time with emojis. This movie has no merit, no redeeming qualities and no enjoyment to be had while watching it. This 90 minute endurance test serves only as product placement and an advertisement. If you went to the theatre to watch this movie, you'd probably have a hard time telling the difference between the pre-movie ads and the movie itself. That would also mean that you paid for that experience, and for that you have my sympathy. They actually somehow got Sir Patrick Stewart to voice a role in this movie, and his character was, quite literally, poop. Delivering some of the laziest poop jokes that Hollywood has ever written, I guess even Picard needs the money. This movie is absolute trash, not even worthy of being taken into a tip or a landfill, just atomically disassemble the entire thing and launch it into space where some alien colony will find it and eradicate it with lasers. The Emoji Movie made 217.8 Million dollars at the box office with a budget of 50 million dollars. Economists suspect that this movie will serve as a catalyst for another worldwide economic crash, and I for one welcome it. This movie actually won awards and were nominated for some others, some of which were more deserving. It won worst picture, worst director, worst screen combo and worst screenplay. It was also nominated for the Black Reel Awards, Movieguide Awards and Kids' Choice Awards, for whatever value that's worth. I don't think I can actually get away with simply saying that this movie is bad, everyone knows it. You know it, I know it, the people that made this movie know it and even the people that were paid to give these movies good reviews especially know it. Things need to change. We need to riot. We need to start a new Hollywood revolution. Anyone that is listening needs to heed my call. We need to tell people that we will not stand for this anymore. WE. WANT. FREEDOM."

And I read the synopsis which promised a nice and funny premise.\n\nBut then, at its release day here in Mexico, I found out because of a meme (yes, really) something strange about it: its terrible and crappy ratings and reviews at Rotten Tomatoes and also here in IMDb. I mean, I have seen lots of good films that have a 4 or even a 3 as rating, but 1.5 was...a bit too much for me.\n\nAnd well, despite of knowing that I probably was going to see a real piece of sh*t of movie, I took my seat throwing to the trash for a while all the bad things that everyone was saying about 'The emoji movie'.\n\nAnd yes, I saw the probable reasons why to hate this movie, particularly two of them: one, it was at times a bit slow; and two, the jokes were at times silly and unfunny, especially for one of the main audiences this movie was meant to be directed: teens. Because all the things we teens consider funny nowadays contain bad words, and as this movie is meant also for children, that includes the jokes which, at least I as a teenager, felt them a bit old-fashioned.\n\nBut anyway, I don't really think it deserved such harsh ratings, as there have been worse movies of its type, and, believe it or not, it is funny and entertaining at times, and the emojis made the experience worthwhile for me. In conclusion, I wouldn't recommend this one as one of the best animated movies of the year, but anyway, I would suggest you that, if you want to see it, do it, but not with very high expectations, but still, without reading the bad reviews.\n\nThanks for reading!"

I found the antagonist actually pretty creepy, as are all perpetually happy people.\n\nUltimately I came away feeling warmly about the movie for it's rich, distinctive world, positive message and how it embodies an aspect of its time while tying it to a universal them even if it's not exactly subtle about it."

The jokes are shocking, the characters are either bland or mean-spirited, the animation is so poor, the voice work is sluggish and dull, the character designs are lazy, the story and its sub-plots are lazily stolen from other movies, and worst of all... they sacrificed so many good movie ideas to make this shameless money-grabbing ploy.\n\nI do not recommend this movie at all, your kids deserve better than a movie like this, even if you rent it, its not worth wasting your money, I wouldn't even take it if it was free.

At school everyone was talking about how trash it is and stuff. Well, that is what 2 of my friends say anyways. And for the whole school days we sometimes talk about why the movie is garbage and how the characters too atrocious (referring to the 3rd Dimensional smileys with arms and legs.) I said that I was gonna watch it after it's launch. and never did. For 3 years. Till in 2020, I thought that I was going to watch said movie title on Netflix. My sister has her subscription of Netflix for the both of us so it would be very easy to get ahold with the movie. So I actually watched it. At first I thought it was going to be worse just like the Internet thought but... In my opinion AGAIN, I don't love it... I don't hate it either... It's just In... The middle. Ok done."

        "review_detailed_main": "'THE EMOJI MOVIE': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)\n\nA computer animated kids movie about a world of living emoji symbols, where a 'meh symbol' malfunctions and is hunted down to be deleted. The film stars the voices of T.J. Miller, James Corden, Anna Faris, Maya Rudolph, Steven Wright and Jennifer Coolidge. It was directed by Tony Leondis, and it was written by Leondis, Eric Siegel and Mike White. The movie has received almost unanimously negative reviews from critics and film fans alike (on IMDb at least), but it did do well at the Box Office still (kids seem to like it). I found it to be pretty pointless, and not really humorous at all, but it's not as bad as the reviews make it out to be either.\n\nThe story is set in Textopolis; a digital city of emojis that all live inside the phone of a teenager named Alex (Jake T. Austin). Gene (Miller) is a meh symbol, who has the special ability to make many different expressions. On his first day of work, Gene panics and makes the wrong expression. This causes Alex to lose faith in his phone, and it puts all of Textopolis in danger. The leader of the text center, a smiley named Smiler (Rudolph), decides that Gene is a malfunction and she orders him to be deleted. Gene flees, with the help of a once popular emoji named Hi-5 (Corden), who's now lost his fame, and a hacker named Jailbreak (Faris). Smiler sends bots after them to delete Gene.\n\nThe movie seems like a decent enough kids' flick; it's colorful, adventuresome and mildly amusing (the voice cast does decent enough work too). I of course wasn't entertained by it, but of course the movie wasn't made for me obviously. Kids seem to like it, so it's hard to claim that it's a horrible film. There's not much of anything in there for adults though, and it definitely doesn't have anything of substantial value to teach children. So I'd say it's an OK kids flick at best, that's definitely nothing special (that's for sure)."

None. -It is a rip off of a lot of animated miracles of the decade. Like Inside Out or The Lego Movie. Or Wreck it Ralph. It explores characters trying to express themselves (Inside Out), Crazy haired feminists (The Lego Movie's Wildstyle, except the \"feminist\" in The Emoji Movie was kind of a vehicle to propel what is right nowadays), and going to different apps (Wreck it Ralph, apps instead of video games). -The \"jokes\" were so unoriginal and predictable and unfunny I had to have a cold water bottle next to me so I could douse myself to stop my brain from overheating. -The ending of this abomination should have made me happy. You know, the movie is over, I can go back to living a regular life, but it didn't.

        "review_title": "Ripped off Wreck it Ralph and its audience",
        "review_detailed_main": "The Emoji Movie 3 out of 10. On all levels, it is a derivative of Wreck it Ralph and similar movies, replicating its premise, characters and themes, but executed without any nuance, design, substance or purpose. Where Wreck it Ralph is built on easy nostalgia-bait, the Emoji Movie seems to be a series of advertisements and product placements for Just Dance, Candy Crush and other apps. The Emoji Movie goes so far as to copy the twist regarding the female lead.\n\nThe viewing experience is tiring as the comedy the movie strings its plot points together with is either knowingly lazy, or arrogantly naive. Humour in this movie is supposedly evident when high five throws up candy, monkeys say they are off to do \"monkey business\", or when Sir Patrick Stewart, the poop emoji says the words \"stink\", \"duty\", and - Emoji 1: \"Poop, youre so soft\" Sir Patrick Stewart as the poop emoji: \"Not too soft I hope\"\n\nThe animation was basic, but not poor and distracting, so I guess that makes it boring. The world of 'Textopolis' and the phone was very basic and bare, even with all the bright colours on the screen. The music in this movie is played very obnoxiously, with half relevant dance songs such as, wake me up before you go-go, feel this moment and cheerleader to name a few. The icing on the cake to this movie is when it ends on an impromptu dance party, where everyone comes to accept the main character instantly, kinda like, but worse than, Despicable Me, Megamind and The LEGO Movie. The relationships between the main three characters, the high five, the meh and jailbreak was more like 3 people hanging around each other, going to the same place, than high five and meh being friends and jailbreak any sort of love interest. The slang made to relate to kids was also outdated by the time this movie came out. Having James Corden say shade, #blessed, lit and slay was really forced and unnecessary. I would also rather leave out the references in this movie that do not appeal to kids and are not enough to appeal to adults. The poop emoji pretending to be in star trek, the culture of internet trolls and the Trojan horse virus. Kids deserve better than a cheap 86 minute distraction - see The Lego Movie or Wreck it Ralph instead, which both executed an 'it's okay to be yourself/different' story on a far greater level."

        "review_title": "a whimsical satire on the return of hieroglyphics",
        "review_detailed_main": "The universal panning of The Emoji Movie (2017) is not deserved nor is it the worst movie of the year. It is easy to dismiss an animated film that satirises how humans communicate. However, it does raise serious issues; so if you are not interested in hearing a defence of the film, stop reading now.\n\nThere are a number of levels at which The Emoji Movie can be read. If you expect conventional narrative logic, characterisation, emotional impact, clever script or technical originality, you will inevitably be disappointed. But if you are looking for an imaginative take on today's mass communication culture, it is an interesting film. The animated story unfolds inside the nano-world of a smartphone, amongst the apps populated by emoji. We see 'life' from the viewpoint of Gene who, on his first day in the emoji directory, is deemed dysfunctional because he shows more expression than allowed by his single-dimension 'meh' persona. When the phone-owning teenager selects Gene to send to his girlfriend it causes communication chaos in both human and smartphone worlds. Gene becomes a doomed emoji and must flee Textopolis in search of reprogramming, passing through firewalls and big-name apps like Instagram, Spotify and Twitter. He teams up with another obsolete emoji called Hi 5 and a love interest named Jailbreak, all with deadly bots in hot pursuit while the trio flee for safety in the Cloud. Doomsday approaches when the teenager decides to wipe his phone.\n\nOK, OK; you were warned that it is not a conventional film. So, what's the point? One clue is the classroom teacher who explains to cell phone-dependent students that human communication was first recorded using ancient hieroglyphics, a pictographic language similar to an emoji directory. Despite the evolution of written communication over millennia, the use of single-meaning pictographic symbols has exploded. Is this the way of the future? While the film does not answer this question, it does offer an imaginative look into the world of smartphone communication. There is a social class system that groups emoji into favourites, ordinary, and rarely used, and the favourites rule the world with popular one-dimensional messages. Ambivalent or unpopular emoji are publicly persecuted and the trash is the ghetto of the unwanted. The Smiley emoji was the first ever made and it now exerts totalitarian control through a smile that appears happy but can also mask sinister intent. Gender politics rules the emoji and tomboy Jailbreak is really a princess in disguise who is desperately trying to avoid being treated like a girl. In other words, the emoji domain is a perfect mirror of the human world.\n\nNobody is arguing that this is a great film, but it is not a disaster. Decades from now it will be dug up and studied as a whimsical cultural artefact that portrays the imagined relationship between humanity and digital communication. Researchers will ask why hieroglyphics returned as a universal language and why humans came to rely on homogenised icons to convey meaning. If a movie can change the way you see things then it is worthwhile. This writer will never look at emoji in the same way again."

        "review_title": "The one thing relevant in \"The Emoji Movie\" is it's failure, let's examine the industrial accident...",
        "review_detailed_main": "In my \"Top Gun\" review, I said there was nothing wrong with the 'commercial' look of the film since the product placement is the whole setting. I sarcastically added: 'except for the emoji movie'. To be fair, I hadn't seen the movie. Now, I did. Do I withdraw my statement? Nope.\n\nBut let's face it, criticizing \"The Emoji Movie\" would be like Homer Simpson repetitively hitting the Krusty burglar with that kid crying \"stop it, stop it, he's already dead\". No need to punch the cadaver or shoot the ambulance as French say, \"The Emoji Movie\" achieve one milestone by becoming the first film to win the Worst Picture Razzie... it did so brilliantly that commentators went pretty creative on it (one remembers the Rotten Tomatoes consensus). I'll try to be more constructive.\n\nLet's examine the film. First, it's not the 'product placement' that is problematic, besides \"Top Gun\", you have many quality films that couldn't do without brandname-dropping (\"The Social Network\", \"Cast Away\"...). The real insult is that the writers took our 'wow' for granted just because we're having familiar everyday technology on the big screen. Some bits like the Firewall or the Dropbox were okay but did we need that lengthy dancing app sequence? Couldn't have they come up with something more imaginative with at least ONE social network?\n\nSome would argue that the real mistake was to make a bland cardboard character out of the young smartphone owner... and that predictable crush no one could care about. I think it's downright impossible to make a deep soul connection between emojis and people \u00e0 la \"Inside Out\" (which it obviously ripped off). It's tough enough to make emojis as relatable as humans but humans are bound to appear as predictable and boring as emojis if they're defined by them. Now, would have the film worked better if it was just about Emojis? You know, like the Smurfs... but how do you make an Emoji movie without their main users?\n\nGosh, must have been one hell of a brainstorming session in that conference room!\n\nNow, supposing humans are relegated to supporting players (after all, it did work for the Lego movie) but then how about the Emoji characters? You have a 'Meh' emoji who refuses to be defined by one expression: we got it: MISFIT. You have Jailbreak as the female who doesn't want to be 'categorized' and rejects love, we got it: GIRL POWER. Hi-5 is the comical sidekick, and Patrick Stewart is the prestigious cameo, voicing Poo. And you know what? That's not even the problem.\n\nHave a respectable actor voice a poo, and it's an average gag at best. Have him say only poo-related jokes, it kills, annihilates and exterminates the fun. Humor is a matter of contrast, so let's just have a poo behaving like a respectable citizen (did I just write that?) Having the Big Bad as a Smiley was an interesting twist... although nothing new (cough *Joker*). Now, don't get me start on 'Meh' parents, the most tired joke of the film, and the responsible for a puzzlement I never thought I'd have: do emojis reproduce? Do 'Meh's go only with 'Meh's? Are emojis racist? Do a crying and a happy one made a happy tears one?\n\nLike another film I reviewed recently, \"The Emoji Movie\" is a film that the more it makes sense, the less it does. The premise is ludicrous though it had potential, the treatment was predictable but exploiting many overused tropes from better movies, the product placements were superficial, the human world didn't make us care and ultimately, it's hard to imagine Emojis as living creatures.\n\nFinally, I remembered the way I use my own emojis: my favorite are the Thumbs Up when I want to save myself writing two lines of approval, the kissing heart when I receive pictures of babies... which makes me realize that I hate when I get only emojis as answers. Let's be honest, emojis are semantic loopholes, products of our intellectual laziness and yet the film portrays them as a pillar of the new-age communication. I wouldn't say no one wants to watch a movie to remember how lobotomized we are by these little creatures... but not one that gives a noble dimension to their existence.\n\nNow, there's a hidden relevance in the film, something that could have elevated it to the level of social comment, had it dared to have an edge, to end with a moral twist where the boy would win the girl's heart by just talking to her... how about having that message communicated to the climax 'talk to her' or something like that... that the film obviously makes the emojis the alpha and omega of the life of a teenager could only foreshadow its failure. Not to say that there aren't good moments, the animation can please the kiddies on a mindless level, although the graphics might be too overstimulating.\n\nStill, I'm glad the film was made because if cinema needs masterpieces, it also needs a few occasional big stinks. Movies like \"Cats\" or \"Batman and Robin\". Movies that reveal how far Hollywood marketing can go in its faith on our mediocrity and how low it can sink for the sake of cash-making flashy idiocy.\n\nCinema needs movies that make audience say \"enough is enough', movies that show that even the lousiest gimmicks are supposed to serve a plot, that kids aren't just dim-witted consumers who'd grab anything just because it's got pretty nice colors.\n\nThere's a limit to how far you can push the me-toos (I mean the marketing strategy) to emulate dinosaurs, while reality put you back to the state of La Fontaine's frog that wished to be as big as an Ox and so she started puffing herself out and kept doing it more and more. What happened to her is the perfect metaphor for \"The Emoji Movie\" ultimate fate."

Sure, besides using emojis, the plot may be less unique, but it was still a fun watch for day when you have nothing else to do.\n\nMost people giving this a 1 star review are being dramatic and overcritical, especially given that I've seen much worse movies in the theaters that ended up with 5 or 6 stars on IMBD. Also please ignore the 10-star reviews from trolls who are trying to be funny.\n\nBottom line: Don't expect an instant classic and you will enjoy this! Give it a shot!"

I have seen some movies that are worth rating a 1 before, but The Emoji Movie isn't quite that bad. This was the perfect movie for my 11 year old son, as he LOVED It! I was mildly amused. The movie wasn't awful, and it wasn't great.\n\nThe movie is about a \"meh\" emoticon that gets sent (by the user) while making a different face. Apparently, it is unheard of to make the wrong face, so that gets him into a lot of trouble. He befriends an emoticon that used to be popular, but is hardly ever used now, and they seek out a emoticon defector/hacker to help Gene (Meh), become the meh he thinks he is supposed to be. I felt the movie had a good message about being yourself, although the character's aren't given much depth in the film.\n\nIf you are considering taking your kids to this because you want something to do, but are unsure because of your reviews, you could take a chance on it. If you are broke and don't go to the movies very often, however, wait for video or streaming. Overall, it is a light, cheesy watch if there isn't anything else to see with the kids."

Some things are average or done somewhat-competently, like the overall animation, but nothing is actually above average or good.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n-It's soulless\n\n-Has no pacing\n\n-Has no character development but still tries to force some anyways\n\n-Hates millennials, thinks we are dumb and self centered and callous. It also stereotypes us while preaching about not stereotyping women\n\n-literally forces feminism into the plot worse than any other film I have ever seen and tries to make princess emojis seem anti-women\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-dialogue breaks down into 4 very obvious categories: 1.

        "review_detailed_main": "Ever since The Lego Movie was made, I've taken it upon myself to be open to more ideas that sound like cash grabs, but could also be more. The Lego Movie sounded like a giant commercial for the toy company. Instead, it was smart tribute to the creativity it inspires and was very funny. That has made me realize that out of everything, storytelling can allow anything to be engaging if people can emotionally connect with it enough. If people could find that connection with a bunch of toys and bricks, whose to say that the same thing could be found with emojis?\n\nMost people with smartphones have used an emoji at some point. I myself like the ones that either engage laughter or show off that I'm trying to convey something smooth. While I have no problem using it every once and a while, I dislike it when it becomes the prominent way of communication. I haven't asked any teenagers about that, but I'm sure that most of them still need text to order specific food or to tell their parents that their out until midnight. I like the think that all teens are smart, but The Emoji Movie makes them an unsalable group.\n\nIn the smartphone of high schooler Alex (played by Jake T. Austin), is where all the emojis live where they live and work a part of the texting app. Meh emojis Mel (played by Steven Wright) and Mary (played by Jennifer Coolidge) are about their see their son Gene (played by T.J. Miller) go off to be used in his first text. Gene seems to have the ability to show other expressions and that happens when his text goes wrong. The leader of the emojis Smiler (played by Maya Rudolph) talks with other emojis like the Devil Emoji (played by Sean Hayes), dancer emoji (played by Sofia Vergara) and Poop emoji (played by Patrick Stewart) about what to do.\n\nWhen Gene gets word that he is likely to be deleted, he escapes with the hand emoji, HI-5 (played by James Cordon). Upon leaving the texting app, he finds a jailbreak emoji (played by Anna Faris) who tells him that if they can get to the Icloud, then his source code can be fixed. From there, they go through several apps including Candy Crush, Instagram, Just Dance, and more while everybody learns about being themselves...or something like that.\n\nSony pictures should be ashamed. The Emoji Movie has to be one of the most obvious product plug movies ever made. I thought The Internship (the movie about Google) was bad, but this sets a new record. Not only do the story rip off Wreck it Ralph, Inside Out and The Lego Movie, but several times, the plot just stops to make another advertisement. If anything, I felt like I just sat through an introduction for a cult; a cult that clearly does not understand how teenagers, computers, programs, apps, games, and emotional storytelling work.\n\nEven for it's obnoxious tie ins, how are the characters? As hard as the majority of these actors try, this script does everything to suck out anything funny or interesting. This is more then a bad movie; this is a black mark on a resume that is likely to hurt every single person involved. I cannot remember anytime that I laughed, nor even heard a chuckle from the kids in my theater. I can only imagine that the parents that took their kids to this were punishing them. I wouldn't have been that cruel to my own. This is a movie that simply appeals to no one (it's too adult for kids and too stupid for the teenage audience they would have been the better targeted crowd).\n\nIs the animation even worth noting? Even that suffers from the story. Because the majority of the emojis are necessarily bright for their use, this doesn't allow them to pop out. It's just a mess of pixilation and phone advertisements.\n\nThis kind of movie makes me mad that millions of dollars are spent making this garbage over original stories that aspiring artists are trying to pitch.\n\nI'll give this one poop emojis out of five. This movie doesn't even deserve a formal ending, so I'll end it on this: Shame on you Sony Shame on you Sony Shame on you Sony Shame on you Sony"

Gene is a meh emoji who does not have a filter, and he would make the wrong face. Gene = Emmet. One scene references Wreck-It Ralph. Hi-5 is the worst comic relief I've ever seen. Scrappy Doo? PFFT! What does he have against the Hi-5 Emoji? Jailbreak is Wyldstyle, and Smiley is Candy King or Lord Business. This film was so predictable and rotten, that it got a 1.4 on IMDb. This overtakes Adam Sandler's Jack and Jill as the 3rd worst movie in my Worst Movies List. On the plus side...

I will excuse them if the movies at that time were very bad and they were waiting for something great or if they were very great and they were disappointed in it, although it is not something you expect a lot for. A good movie for children above 7 Years. I watched it when I was 11 and it was fun for me. A minute ago i saw the trailer and it came out even better than what I expected when I wrote the first letter."

Its worst sin, in my eyes at least is that the Popeye movie which I was pretty excited for, the first time I saw it I was overcome with nostalgic memories from when i would watch old 1950s Popeye cartoons, and now, the Popeye movie won't exist, we traded it for the Emoji Movie."

In my day, we had a rotary phone that took 2 minutes just to dial, AND WE LIKED IT. But these days the children's have an entire city called Textopolis in those dang devices.

If you seen the endless spiral of cheesy \"Be YOURSELF\" kids movies, you seen the plot of this. Okay, it's this, an emoji has more than one emotion (gee, where have I've seen THIS before?), and the phone is getting deleted, IDK what else the plot is but product placement or ads. Second of all, the characters. They're the blandest characters I've seen all year. Gene is the generic \"guy who is different than the rest who is accepted in the end\", Hi-5 (who's idea of a name is this?), \"the comedy relief who is annoying and as hyperactive as a 3 year on sugar\", and Jailbreak, the \"hardened chick who is kinda of a feminist that would fit in well with the Tumblr crowd of edgy 20 somethings\" Also, there are other characters who are completely one dimensional and only used for \"teh plot\" and/or comedy. Finally, this movie sucked big time. The only positive thing is that most people hate it, including children. That restored some of my faith in humanity. Anyways, this is Princess Radar signing out."

        "review_detailed_main": "(Warning: Contains Minor Spoilers) One does not watch a film like The Emoji Movie expecting anything but corporate pandering from a company as vile as Sony. However the film somehow managed to be worst than my expectations. Considering I have seen both The Nut Job and Minions in theaters, saying The Emoji Movie is the worst animated film I have ever seen, and one of the worst films I have ever seen, shows that the true quality of this film. What's the plot? Gene the emoji wants to become \"meh,\" as he is a malfunction. After destroying the emoji center, Smiler, who is simply annoying, wants to kill Gene. Gene finds a useless comic relief named Hi-Five, who leads him Jailbreak, a hacker emoji that has extremely forced character traits. You can assume that along the way there will be poop jokes, jokes that are so bad you don't even know they're jokes, bad outdated references, a void of likable characters and emotion (ironic for a film centered around emojis), forced feminism, a romance between meh and female meh that is focused on for around 20 minutes,and scenes, like the one centered in Just Dance, that are so blatantly awful and go on for so long, you will want to bludgeon yourself multiple times. Whenever you think the film can't get worse it does, and by the third act, my friends and I laughed so hard, since the ending was so nonsensical, pandering, and followed every clich\u00e9 you've seen in other awful kids movies, like the ending dance sequence, except they are executed worse. One may say there are worse films than The Emoji Movie, and there probably are. And by that I mean there may be a few films worse than it. But the mentality behind this film, created from a greedy company that wants to create low-effort garbage to exploit a young audience while having the audacity to also make fun of that audience, as lazily as one could. This company pushes back reviews to allow films like this to do well, and says that the film isn't bad because it is made for a certain age group. This company has no purpose, other than to leech off of your money, and to continue releasing mass quantities of terrible films, like The Star, and potentially Peter Rabbit. The day Sony goes bankrupt will be happy day for all of humanity. Let's hope that day is sooner rather than later."

But as a regular viewer who has small kids I can say it is quite entertaining and has some good things for little kids to learn, e.g. the main character, Gene, never leaves his friends behind and treats other members of his little emoji world with kindness no matter where they are in their social hierarchy. There are some interesting parallels with the real world as well: Gene has to be \"meh\" just like his parents who are \"real pros\". But instead he has a special ability to express many feelings at once which is treated as a \"malfunction\". One real story I can recall was about a kid who was incredibly talented dancer but could not focus in class and was nearly diagnosed with ADHD. We force kids and people in general into some sort of boxes and if they don't fit we consider it a disorder, a \"malfunction\", something that is not cool and should be fixed. This animation movie teaches little kids to be themselves and freely express themselves. Old idea but good nonetheless. This is great. Whoever left extremely low ratings are probably sad people who cannot see anything good in life. Maybe the storyline wasn't great and the director wasn't good but there are good things about this anination and you cannot seriously be that displeased with just about everything."

I've heard people say, \"It's just a kids movie! Were you really expecting a masterpiece out of an emoji?\"\n\nFirst off, animated movies have broken our expectations before. If you can make a masterpiece out of; a rat who wants to be a chef (Ratatouille), a penguin who can surf (Surf's up), oh and A PANDA WHO WANTS TO DO MARTIAL ARTS (Kung Fu Panda), you can make a good movie out of just about anything, regardless of who made it.\n\nAlso, the \"It's just a kids movie\" is just the laziest excuse ever. I personally think that children deserve good movies too, and not just a distraction to gawk and laugh at. The movies I mentioned above can actually be enjoyable for people other than 5 year old's. And no, lovely animation and a 'good message' isn't enough anymore.\n\nI will say a few positives, like the animation is amazing, a few jokes got a guilty smile out of me, and I admire Jailbreak's line: \"How can you be number one, if there are no other numbers?\" So, one or two things to enjoy, but just skip it, and show your kids a better movie."

How much of a base level have we sank to where we've gotten to the stage where Sony thinks we can be entertained by something so basic and pandering.\n\nThe plot is essentially a rip off of Wreck it Ralph where TJ Miller emoji, Anna Faris emoji and James Corden emoji go off the rails trying to find sanctuary as opposed to their dull existence serving the phone user. The conundrum in the human world is just the phone user stressing out over what emoji to send his crush to win her affections. I'm just there thinking, \"are you actually kidding me?\" How out of touch are these mid-life crisis suffering writers, that they think that the youth of today will relate to something so insultingly simplistic?\n\nThe product placement of the phone apps such as Twitter, Instagram, Candy Crush, etc. are incredibly on the nose too. It's pandering to the extent that you will almost be offended by it.\n\nAvoid this film at all costs. They cast Patrick Stewart as the poop emoji! How much of a deterrent do you need?!"

No other movie has ever made me want to blind and deafen myself as much as this film yet, I'm sure if I watched this properly it would have given me some sort of mental retardation and I properly would've enjoyed the array of pretty colours.\n\nWhilst in the cinema I did actually hear a child laugh, I really hope this was either out of irony for how bad it was or they were laughing at their parents for wasting their money on this piece of \ud83d\udca9.\n\nFive reasons why this film does get 1 star however:\n\n1. It makes me appreciate how every other film isn't this one\n\n2. It brought me closer to death and ergo out of a world that creates something like the emoji movie.\n\n3. It gave me the greatest feeling I've ever had when it ended\n\n4. Amy Schumar wasn't in it\n\n5. The lowest you can rate a film on IMDb is 1 star"

A medium that let's your imagination fly with emotional and powerful movies, with great messages and great different styles, and what did Sony Pictures Animation offered to us? An 88-minute evil, stupid, manipulative and offensive commercial. Yes, it's a commercial, not a movie. Because the film is so focused to promote apps and emojis instead of thinking how to make this movie work.\n\nPeople might be overrating the Lego movies, but it's justified. As much as it's an excuse to sell Legos, it had an actual creative team that thought a good script first, and then how to sell it. Same case with Toy Story, they had a creative and inspired team that loved animation and cared about this concept as silly it sounds, and it worked.\n\nThe emoji movie doesn't want to be creative, funny or at least unique in any aspect. It's your typical \"be yourself\" movie but with characters that are mean spirited with no personality, with a story that makes no sense and with really bad morals about treating the rest of people.\n\nThis is a \"movie\" that embraces the smartphones and apps and tells you that you should depend on your phone instead of talk with real people and live the real life.\n\nThis is a \"movie\" that manipulates you with pop songs, random and stupid jokes, bad animation and awful dialogue to buy everything they offer in this commercial and to make you think that the things they say in this movie is \"profund\".\n\nThis is a \"movie\" that says that it's OK to be yourself, but you need to break rules and do nothing to fix your problem unless it's buying a smartphone.\n\nThis is a \"movie\" that it's already dated by the time to review is posted, that shows no compassion to the kids, that treats the audience like stupid people who went to see this and insults every piece of minimum of cleverness just to the sake to sell toys about emojis.\n\nSony Pictures Animation failed so bad to make this movie a franchise and it shows they don't know how to make a good animated movie, because they are more focused on how to market this towards children.\n\nIt's a waste of time and no other kid should see this by its own merits ever again. It needs to be banished from the history of film making and from the art of animation.\n\nYou want to show something for your kids? Let them watch anything else instead of Emoji movie. Because it doesn't teach anything good, it's mean spirited, it's too stupid to be taken seriously and it's too annoying and uninspired to be a comedy.\n\nDon't watch it ironically, don't watch it for the memes, don't watch it as a family film, just avoid everything that it's related with this horrible product. Trust me, you'll regret if you see it.\n\nI've warned you."

To clarify: it succeeded by ticking all the boxes with the bare minimum, but it's so similar to movies of its kind, I cannot understand why it's rated so low.\n\nBecause if you liked Bee Movie, you're going to like this. OK so it's not quite as well rounded as Bee Movie (or in fact any of the successful animated movies), but it's certainly not far off.\n\nUltimately it's a silly 90 minutes - and that's all it was ever supposed to be.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ever wonder what would happen if somebody made a movie in which every clich\u00e9 ever was used with nothing original being added? No? Well what if I told you there was a movie that made Jaws 4: The Revenge look like Alien or made the Room look like The Godfather?\n\nThat movie isn't even on par with the awful disgrace to humanity that is the Emoji movie. This is not even close to being a good movie. If you can even call it a movie, it's the worst movie ever made! And there have been lots of bad animated films, hell lots of films in general, what is this the year 2017. But I think this one takes the awful cake made out of rotten eggs made out of smartphone emoji's.\n\nIt's a rip off of The Lego Movie, Inside Out, and Wreck it Ralph all at once, and it is beyond any doubt the worst thing that Sony ever created. Worse than Hotel Transylvania, worse than Open Season, worse than the Smurfs reboot, worse than the Annie remake, worse than Battlefield Los Angeles, worse than After Earth, worse than Pixels, worse than Ghostbusters 2016.\n\nThere may be films that are worse in plot like Home on the Range, worse aesthetically like Shark Tale, or worse character wise like Norm of the North. But in terms of overall quality, this is the all time low! Stay away! Stay away as far as possible!\n\nTHE ABSOLUTE ONLY THING THIS MOVIE CAN DO IS MAKE YOU APPRECIATE OTHER MEDIA! If you disregard my previous advice and watch this film anyway, and somehow manage to sit through it, don't expect a gold medal. You just wasted your time, and I feel bad for you. Likewise if you got this warning too late, once again you have my condolences, especially if you're on the younger side. BUT, you will be able to actively appreciate other media. You'll look at Jurassic World the way you see King Kong, you'll see Sword Art Online the way you see The Last Airbender (the TV series), and you'll see Brave the way you see Toy Story! Go watch any of those before you see this movie, but if you ignore my advice, whenever you watch another form of media at least you'll be able to say without a doubt, \"I've seen a lot worse.\""

We are a family of all ages from 6 to 50 and did not watch this movie for quite a while BECAUSE of its bad ratings (3.0). (so it should be one of the worst movies of all times). After watching it, all of us completely disagree. It quite is funny, has some nice twists and an ok story. It one of the many 5.5 to 6.0 animations that are entertaining and easy to watch. I cannot understand either the rating nor some of the bad critics here. Why is it a problem to have some similarities to other stories? (and hey yess Inside out has a trash dump too, and in Wreck it Ralph they also changing between apps)\n\nThe book of life plays partially in the \"world of the remembered\" and Coco does too, that does not mean Coco is any less of a great movie.\n\nDon\u00b4t get me wrong! Of course the Emoji Movie is NOT Coco. But to my opinion its a solid 5 or even a weak 6.\n\n...and to all those who said \"we\u00b4ve seen it all before\" here some IMDB ratings with no further comments ...\n\nJustice League 6.9 Avengers 8.1 The Flash 8.0 Spider-Man 7.3 The Amazing Spider-Man 7.0 Spider-Man Homecoming 7.5\n\n..and yes rotten tomatoes also slaughtered the movie, but we found more and more to not look at their critics because what we consider to be good movies seems to be quite different to their judgement. (e.g. Pixars \"Brave\" or \"the golden compass\" that we all here considered to be great movies)"

She watches some dumb shows/movies on Netflix or Disney Jr. channel. I thought I've seen enough of those things to prepare myself for anything this Emoji movie can throw at me. Oh sh!t I was naive! This is the first movie I can bet $10000 on how it would end just after 5 minutes into the plot. And there is ABSOLUTELY no highlight point throughout the 80 minutes of bore. I would have completely fallen asleep within 20 minutes if I was not the only adult accompanying my girl.\n\nIt is absolutely fitting that the main character is called Meh. All conversations are Meh. Jokes are meh. Story lines are meh. I understand our reliance on, or addiction to, digital gadgets is somewhat inevitable in our lives, but PLEASE!

(big difference).\n\nThis movie is basically your clich\u00e9 animated kids movie.. it has some humor that is slightly funny, a villain, and an end goal. I predicted the ending within the first 10 minutes of watching the film. I was right.\n\nThere were so many opportunites missed with this film but I am surprised at the 1.5 average rating.

I found the antagonist actually pretty creepy, as are all perpetually happy people.\n\nUltimately I came away feeling warmly about the movie for it's rich, distinctive world, positive message and how it embodies an aspect of its time while tying it to a universal them even if it's not exactly subtle about it."

        "review_detailed_main": "I finally watched this solely because of the bad reviews and because it's on Netflix and I don't understand what's so bad about it.\n\nIt wasn't a great movie, but really wasn't that bad. It had an actual plot, a decent enough script, and there was character growth. I'd rank it significantly higher than the 2024 animated disasters Despicable Me 4 and The Garfield Movie(both which were unwatchable). The Emoji Movie had its cringe moments, especially when out-of-touch Hollywood decided again to play 80s music for children, but overall was an okay movie.\n\nMy main issue is that they targetted the wrong audience. Children aren't really texting, and there would've just been more opportunity if they had made this an adult cartoon. Emojis are used a lot on dating apps and texting apps, but not so much on Spotify and Just Dance."

        "review_detailed_main": "Being a person who's outer expression is mostly 'meh', I will now be reminded of this movie whenever I'm aware of my outward indifference. So now I feel like I've been forever tainted.\n\nMost people have slammed this as the worst thing to ever be made. That's harsh, even though I don't completely disagree. But I have seen worse things. Still, why 2 stars and not 1 or less? Well, 1 is for the voicing talent of T.J. Miller. I like the guy. He's what made the Silicon Valley series funny. And here, just hearing his voice, felt comforting. He's like that friend with the cool voice and the interesting stories (true or not) who can talk forever non-stop, but you don't mind because they fill up a void with life. They entertain when you can't be bothered to make an effort. The life of the party when you're happy to take a backseat and just chill whilst nursing your drink. He makes a good buddy.\n\nThe other 1 star just has to go to the sheer audacity of making a movie about emojis in the first place. What would Disney and Pixar writers from 20 years ago make of this? Even the writers of the dystopian Wall-E (2008) would have not predicted the dystopian direction of something like The Emoji Movie becoming a reality. Still, the pitch to Sony (or Columbia Pictures) would have been easy enough. 'Emojis come in a variety of expressions,' they would say. 'So many of them. And each of them can be a different character. Then there's all the animals. And body parts. And objects. And... all the other things you can send in a text that isn't a letter. All of those are characters, so the world building is easy peasy. At this point, Sony (or Columbia Pictures) are almost on board. 'But what about the story?' they'd say. Well, for the producers, that would be the easiest part. Just take a bit of Inside Out (the behind-the-scenes universe) and a bit of Wreck-it-Ralph adventure, and there you have it. The same old rehashed story told from another perspective. They'd argue that kids and young teens would gobble it up. Seeing their favorite emojis up on the screen would be a thing they never knew they loved, up until that moment. 'Just think of all the stuffed and plastic emoji toys that could follow after the movie's success,' they'd say.\n\nIt was a gutsy move. Especially that it was a move made by grown-up responsible adults. Serious people talked about this in conference meetings and studio discussions and writer/animator sessions.\n\nMaybe the whole thing was a dare between the producers and creators? See if they could get something like this green-lit? Because that type of boldness deserves some form of respect, surely. (Nevertheless, Netflix would have happily payed for it anyway if Sony had said no. But Netflix is hardly a challenge in getting something through, so they wouldn't count)."

It contains a dazzling story, a insanely beautiful musical score, and well developed characters. I'd reccomend this movie if you like The Godfather and it's sequels. Though when you compare the Godfather and Emoji Movie, the God Father almost seems like a shameless rip off, yet it came first. I would show it to my kids if I had some."

I've seen a lot of worse animated pictures and I'm clueless about why the rating is so low. I'm also unsure, however, why there are so many user reviews rating it 10. It's an average children's animated movie which adults can also vaguely enjoy."

I never wanted to- there was a small child relation who wanted to see a movie and this was the only one on in theaters when we were out. And by gum, was it bad.\n\nSo, so bad.\n\nBad enough it took me nearly three months just to work up the courage to write a quick review.\n\nThe characters/actors... it was downright depressing hearing Sir Patrick Stewart, one of the finest actors alive, voicing a character named... Poop. Ugh. But generally, the characters were awful. The female lead, I wanted to fling her out a window. She's loathsome. The comedic sidekick was only made worse by James Corden's poor performance. And Eugene, the main lead, was just irritating and unappealing.\n\nThe comedy is dreadful. The plot, frightful. The little girl I went with fidgeted the whole time; not once did she laugh or smile. She seemed bored. So don't try and claim 'kids will like it'. Kids are too good for this.\n\nThis is an ad. A poorly done ad. Avoid it- you can't even MST3K this thing. Abandon all hope, ye who view."
