However the videotape seems to have followed them after Rachel finds another one of those strange deaths. Rachel takes the tape and burns it. Samara starts coming after Aidan, and Rachel must dig up the past to put it to rest.\n\nThe great thing about this sequel is that the actors came back to finish the story off. It's interesting to go back to the source story. However the franchise can't surprise the audience any more. It was a nice fresh idea in the first movie, but the sequel can't shock us anymore. It's a good wrap up. I hope they don't keep dragging this out like other franchises."

Imagine what he could do with a bigger budget and better technology? It is however, not even close to the first, and such improvements don't surface (same CGI, C-list Hallmark Channel cast). It does manage to keep you nervous throughout, but the proper scares are too infrequent and it appears to take itself too seriously. This is all too evident when the creepiest kid in cinema is admitted to hospital and The Ring 2 turns into a child abuse drama for around twenty minutes, leaving you wondering when it'll pick up a bit again.\n\nIt's also the kind of film that demands that you re-watch the first one before you go to see it; the opening makes no sense unless you've seen \"Rings\" on the Collectors Edition DVD, and there's a ton of stuff that may have easily been forgotten if you saw the film three years ago.\n\nIt's alright; it's a horror sequel-remake thing, so you don't expect too much and you wont be disappointed, but you can't help but think it could have been done a bit better."

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie trailers were promising. The premise was semi-promising. Oddly enough both the premise and the trailers were scarier than this sequel to The Ring. Yes, the original Japanese director returns and he conveys the images and symbolism very well, but he does not provide anything engaging here. The two movies do not seem to necessarily connect. It's almost as if they remade the first Ring with a few additions. There is not a lot of new material presented here. The movie tries to scare us by using either the same or similar events from the first. The ominous music playing throughout the film and the fact that this sequel was made so nonsensically are scarier than the movie itself. There are too many things that occur that you just have to accept without explanation. And then after the movie's done, you'll be left with plenty of questions including how the first one relates to this one. I cannot place some of those questions here without spoiling anything, so I'll leave that up to you. Okay, let's move away from the negative and talk about the few positives this film has. The acting is much better than the average horror film and, as stated before, the images are presented very well. The visuals are nice and you come to slightly care about some of the characters, although most of them do ridiculous things. Other than that, I cannot think of much else to say that is good. This movie was just disappointing. Do not watch this with high expectations unless you are easily scared and jump at the \"sudden\" music and scenes. The first Ring was good. It was different and well-made. I did not find it particularly scary, but bizarre. This just relies on music and jump surprises. Fear doesn't even come half circle in this film. If you liked the first Ring and expect to see much more about the story, you may be disappointed as well. But if you only want to see a different version of part one, then you may enjoy this sequel. Good luck =)\n\n4.8/10 Stars"

I like how the movie starts off in a similar way to the first film, since it gives the feeling of deja vu. After that there are some things that are a little to much like the first but they can be ignored with little effort. The story starts out really well as I said the plot is kind of simple but its set out so that it takes a while to see the whole picture. There are some parts with CGI effects that aren't needed and that will annoy some people but thankfully, there's not to many of those. Half way through it gets really good, you don't know whats happening and you don't know how they're going to stop it all you know is that Samara has come back but with unknown intentions. After that it gets a bit obvious and kinda hurried but who cares. To sum it all up I'd have to say it done quite well since the first film was hard to follow up on. See the film for your self, trust me, you won't regret it."

What I got was an interesting piece which I might sooner qualify as a supernatural thriller than a horror movie (but I guess that's what J-horror movies are). Sure, it's quite gross in a couple of places and there are a few heart-stopping moments as well, but what really impressed me was that the entire movie, from the first minute to the last, is filled with this weird kind of suspenseful energy. Even when literally nothing particularly frightening in itself is going on, it still feels \u00aboff\u00bb, it's still unsettling, uncomfortable, on edge. And that for me was the strength of this movie. Not having seen Hideo Nakata's previous Ringu movies, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that he seems to be a master of creating an atmosphere scarier than any special-effect driven sequence could. All the actors did a good job as well \u0096 and Sissy Spacek's cameo was a nice touch \u0096 though I would have liked to have seen a bit more background to the Max-Rachel relationship. All in all, I predict a good show at the box-office for this one!"

The \"rules\" of how the monster interacts with the world are a bit too random. There are many cool and scary moments but the story just isn't as good as in the first movie.\n\nI still like Naomi Watts, she's my favorite. But I liked the character better in the first film. There she was more like a detective, but in the sequel she appears more in the role of a mother.\n\nAs a whole Ring Two is quite basic horror flick but I guess it's worth checking out if you like the first part.

        "review_detailed_main": "Series note: It is imperative that you watch The Ring (2002), and preferably also the short film Rings (2005), before you watch this movie. The Ring Two is constructed as a further \"chapter in a novel\". It will make much less sense, and have far less significance, if you do not watch the other films first.\n\nSet an unspecified but relatively short period of time after the events of The Ring, Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) has now moved from Seattle, Washington to Astoria, Oregon, with her son Aidan (David Dorfman). They're hoping the move to small-town life will help them emotionally recover from the horrific curse they experienced--namely that watching a particular videotape, associated with a strange little girl named Samara (Daveigh Chase/Kelly Stables) would result in one's death if one didn't make a copy and show it to someone else within a week. But when Rachel, now a reporter at a small Astoria newspaper, overhears a report of a disturbingly familiar death on the police scanner, she investigates and discovers that \"the Ring\" has followed her to Oregon. Apparently the videotape they made at the end of the first film to keep themselves alive wasn't the only one to be made. Rachel burns the tape she finds at the crime scene, but does that bring about a new kind of curse?\n\nWhile this is a decent film, it unfortunately does not come near the excellence of The Ring, Rings, or even the original Japanese film, Ringu (1998). I was geared up to love The Ring Two. I think The Ring, directed by Gore Verbinski, is superior to the Japanese original, and the short film Rings, co-written by The Ring Two scripter Ehren Kruger, was just as good, if different, taking the story into an exciting new direction (as suggested by the last few pages of K\u00f4ji Suzuki's Ring novel) that was prime fodder for social commentary in our Internet Age.\n\nBut unfortunately, Kruger didn't continue the same idea past this film's prologue. It's difficult not to believe that maybe the flaws in The Ring Two are the result of Hideo Nakata being in the driver's seat, as the same blemishes also crept up in Ringu and especially Ringu 2 (1999), both of which he also directed. The problem is that The Ring Two spends far too much of its time in a slow, straightforward drama mode, to the detriment of its horror aspects, so that they often seem incoherent and \"tacked on\". It seems like maybe deep down Nakata really wants to be doing realist drama instead.\n\nAs realist drama, there are a number of interesting things going on here. Watts and Dorfman both turn in impressive performances--we wouldn't expect anything less from Watts--in a story that is more of a contemplative meditation on dysfunctional mother/child relationships. For much of the film, the children--Aidan and Samara, go from being the villains to being more like victims. The mothers and \"the system\" are portrayed more as villains. In the sequence prior to the climax, our focus changes to cultural institutions and people upholding the norms within them as the antagonists. It's a weird, but slightly effective shift that makes The Ring Two feel more like a paranoid conspiracy theory film for a moment. But the climax returns to Samara, and reinterprets the curse as a symptom of the dysfunctional familial relationships that are the focus of the film.\n\nIt's not that the kids don't do bad things, with Aidan mostly as a \"channel\" for Samara, in a more literal, symbolic parallel between Samara and her mom and Aidan/Rachel, perhaps suggested by occasional interpretations of The Ring as eventually being about Samara trying to \"reincarnate\" herself as Aidan. On a surface level, you can still read the film as an evil kid flick; but the kids are doing bad things because they're seeking healthy parent/child relationships. It was weird in The Ring that Aidan kept calling Watts' character \"Rachel\" instead of \"Mommy\", but it remained unanalyzed. Here, it is made an issue, and eventually becomes a hinge for resolving the climax. The focus on parent/child relationships also suggests an odd reinterpretation of The Ring, retroactively putting more of an emphasis on Rachel's neglect of Aidan while she was pursuing the mystery of the curse, as well as the odd distancing suggested in scenes such as her conversation with Aidan's teacher.\n\nWhen Nakata does bother with more straightforward horror material, it is usually rewardingly subtle and surreal, aided greatly by special effects maven Peter Chesney. A number of sequences stand out--such as the gravity-defying water, the \"deer attack\", and the scene in the well (which was strongly reminiscent of Nakata's Ringu 2). But again, they do not have quite the impact they should because of the surrounding material. The rest of the technical elements--cinematography, production design, score, etc.--are competent, but The Ring two does not have nearly the stylistic panache of The Ring or Rings.\n\nThe film is an odd amalgamation of genres. The emphasis on realist drama may be off-putting to many horror fans. The horror and weird supernatural stuff may be off-putting to many more mainstream film fans. In the end, the people who will probably like The Ring Two the most are those who were very fond of Ringu 2 and Ringu 0: Basudei (2000). Although I enjoy both, they're closer to \"average\" than \"great\" to me. If another American Ring film is made, I'd like to see the story of the Rings short continued instead."

It is 6 months after the events in the first movie. However, Racheal's resolve quickly turns to dread when evidence at a local crime scene including and unmarked video taped-seems familiar. Racheal realizes that the evil Samara is back.\n\nThe original Ring was scary and thrilling. The sequel isn't loaded with terror. But there are some scenes when I did get a bit terrified. Before, seeing it, I expected to be jumping up and down out of my seat and being really scared. The Ring Two is not a bad movie, I just expected a little more."

The film follows Rachel Keller into Oregon where she tries to forget the events of the first one, but then Samara shows up wanting a mommy... and that is the point of the film. All that CGI crap for absolutely nothing. And that is exactly what this film is. No, really, I am not going to dignify this film with a review worth reading. I am sure Naomi Watts would rather have changed Samara's diaper then done this film!\n\nThis film honestly has no guts, spunk, or attitude that the first film had.

        "review_detailed_main": "I have always believed that the horror genre is the most difficult to master. To make an effective horror film takes an amalgamation of talent, luck and one intangible that most cannot figure out. To me, you have to love the genre and you have to have little studio interference. Films like Halloween, Last House on the Left, Evil Dead, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre were all low budget and independent films and all were pioneers of the genre. All were also emancipated from any studio intervention which more often than not can destroy a director's vision. I would think that somewhere in Urban Legend and The Haunting's vernacular was a good film until the morons who knew nothing about film got a hold of it.\n\nI mention all of this as a precursor to the review because The Ring was a modern day miracle. It was the scariest horror film in twenty years and it was a studio project. I honestly never thought that a film made by Dreamworks would touch a nerve in the way it did. But with direction by Gore Verbinski and Ehren Krueger writing one of the best scripts I've ever been privy to, The Ring scared the hell out of me.\n\nTo do a follow up was almost a no win situation. Not since Nightmare on Elm Street 2 has there been a more disappointing sequel than this one. I don't know where to lay the blame, because Ehren Krueger, whom I respect very much, returned to pen the sequel and you have the director of the Japanese film that started it all, helming this one. So where does the blame fall? Was it the studio who interfered too vehemently? Was it that the Japanese original was that inferior to the Dreamworks version? Or is it just that lightning doesn't strike twice in most films? I'm not sure what the answer is to that perplexing question, all I know is that this is about as much of a true dichotomy from the first. You can't get any further apart.\n\nNaomi Watts is adequate as Rachael and David Dorfman is passable as Aidan, but the continuation of Samara story is perhaps the weak link here. In the original, she was an enigma. Her story was such a mystery that it kept you guessing as to what she was and where she came from. There was a blend of The Changeling and a bit of The Shining all rolled into one. A sequel succeeds when it extends the story, not just retells it. There was no continuation of the story here. No one bothered to explain why Samara can come through the TV and petrify you to death. No one bothered to explain why she is still haunting people through videocassettes. No one bothered to explain anything. Now maybe some are okay with that. Maybe a mystery should remain a mystery. But if you can get past the regression of the story, then what is even more disturbing is that there is nothing remotely disturbing, interesting or scary about the film, and everything that was freaky about Samara in the first one is now like watching Scooby Doo and mystery of Samara. There is no fear of her now. There is nothing remotely disturbing about her. Maybe I was expecting too much, but this film is one of the weakest sequels I have ever seen. If they decide to make a third, they had better go back to their roots and get Verbinski back.\n\nIs it wrong to expect this much from a sequel? Maybe. But then again, there are sequels that can match the original, if not surpass it. At least two of the Friday the 13th sequels surpass the original and if you are talking non horror, then you can also add films like Lethal Weapon 2, Bourne Supremacy and of course classics like Terminator 2, Aliens, Godfather II and Empire Strikes Back to the list of sequels that either equaled or surpassed the original. Now in my opinion, Nakata is not on the same level as Cameron, Lucas or even Copolla, so there is no reason to believe that he can create a better film that Verbinski did. But suffice to say that everything that made the first such a paradigm for years to come, has vanished in this one. It is truly unfortunate as it feels like too many politicians in this one threw their hat into the ring and tried to make changes that did nothing but give us another Nightmare on Elm Street 2.\n\nAnd that is a shame.\n\n2/10"

My taste is a bit different, the picture (I mean everything you see on the screen) was a bit ad hoc, untidy. The effects are also not that good.

I feel the films biggest issue is the writing. The idea of the film feels muttled, and at time a bit forced. The beginning is nearly a rehash of the original, and quite bland to be honest, but luckily it picks up as it goes on and decides to become something rather original. Thankfully we do see the return of Naomi Watts character and her character's son, instead of some new group of people to terrorize- but the effect just isn't the same. Some moments are a bit ridiculous (the deer especially) and some can be a bit dramatic- as Kruger simply doesn't know how to harness the films emotional impact in the most sincere way. Its slower than the original (american remake), although it does prove to be quite interesting- focusing on more ideas to unfold from the original- with the potential being its most glimmering part. Naomi Watt's was great as the films lead, and though it was short, I truly did enjoy Sissy Spacek in her role as well. The look of the film is incredibly well done, and honestly given the script provided, i'm thankful for the original Ring veteran director Hideo Nakata taking over this time around to give the film a much needed touch up. It isn't as scary as the film before it, but it is very creepy, atmospheric, and quite fun to watch unfold. It's a horror mystery, and if you are a fan of both, you'll most likely enjoy it despite the rest of the films flaws.\n\nMy Rating: 6.2/10."

You find a mother willing to do whatever it takes to save her child, gain a deeper understanding and yet have so many more questions. While the firs one holds genuine scares, and suspense this one takes you on a what happens the day after storyline. Mesmerizing, chilling and emotionally dramatic I love them both but only recently saw them back to back and found it most gratifying my friends and I downed a lot of popcorn, and after wards had an interesting discussion two people in our group had never seen either and were scared through out."

The movie didn't have much of a plot (even for those of us with more creative imaginations), and, because of that, it was difficult to follow. I found myself being bored more than anything else and waiting for the next scary scene to shake me awake. The special effects were pretty good, and all the cast members did a really good job with their roles, but despite their abilities, the movie failed to make an impression half as good as the original. There are several points in this movie when you feel like you begin to catch on to something that will eventually make sense (and make it worth your money), only to be let down at the conclusion of the scene. Better save your money and wait for this one to hit rental shelves...I wish I had."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Ring Two joins the new breed of \"Who-dun-it\" mysteries... \"Who-dun-it first\". For example: Creepy Kids... Who-dun-it first? How bout the Sixth Sense, The Shining, the Omen and the Exorcist... A desperate ghost hoping to manifest itself into physical form? Just watch Child's Play and, oh yeah, Ghostbusters II (Veego's even creepier than Samara at times). There's even a taste of Jurassic Park believe it or not. But most of all Who-dun-the-entire-movie first? Of course its predecessor, the Ring.\n\nThe Ring Two is of course the sequel to The Ring. To refresh your memory The Ring was genius. The creepy video tape. The mysterious deaths. The deep history of Samara and her family. And of course the infamous phone call warning you that you will die in 7 days. The first Ring movie was deep. The focus being on the video tape, which is much like the creepy chain letters you get in your e-mail, and the suspense of Rachel (Naomi Watts) dying in 7 days. And finally you get your cheap thrills, which Gore Verbinski accomplished masterfully making The Ring a new legend for our generation.\n\nIf The Ring is deep, The Ring Two is a kiddie pool. With all the things that went on during the first Ring movie, there was nothing left for the Ring Two to do but MORE cheap thrills in between borrowed gags from other thrillers and horror flicks. Verbinski left the director's chair and passed it back to the director from the original Ring Series, Ringu. This was proving to be the most anticipated thriller this year. I was real disappointed to find that the Ring Two simply shouldn't have been made.\n\nThe Ring Two is about Samara who comes back and wants to be human again. Who does she choose? Conveniently the son of Rachel from the first ring.\n\nIf you notice there's so much more to talk about concerning the Ring but all it takes is a couple sentences to sum up everything in the Ring Two. That's because there's not a whole lot that goes on. In this movie, plot line wasn't as important as the cheap thrills. Even with the mentality of wanting to be scared, The Ring Two doesn't deliver as well and leaves you thinking \"ehh... that could've been done a lot better\". The opening sequence, for example, could've been a moment in the movie that all moviegoers will remember just like in the first Ring, but instead it was in short... stupid.\n\nThere's nothing new in the Ring Two. Everything is either recycled from the first movie or reused from other movies. There are three types of movies: good movies, bad movies, and movies that should've never been made. The difference between a bad movie and one that shouldn't have been made is that the latter has a lot to live up to and has the pressure of satisfying the fans of the story, whether it be a sequel or an adaptation from another text. The Ring Two dangerously ruins the mystery behind the first movie which should've been left alone.\n\nEveryone should just watch the Ring One, get scared, be happy, then burn every copy of the Ring Two. That should put Samara away for good."

It wisely avoids the storyline from the Japanese Ring 2 - which is not a good film - and presents a series of ideas that cross the lines of reality and the other-wordly: not only are there spooky goings-on, the film deals with real subject matters like depression, diseases, family dysfunctions, isolation, and the need for affection."

We as a country adored the original because of its different way of film-making, and now, you have \"Boogeyman\", \"White Noise\", and \"The Grudge\", all looking exactly like the original \"The Ring\". That is SO rude! Now I suppose that we will see a third one, somewhere in time...like \"Exorcist III\", cause this one was like, \"Exorcist II : The Heretic\"! It played as a 'part \"two\"', and acted as a \"III\", Yeah, \"Poltergeist III\"! What the hell was Samara saying familiar dialogue such as \"I found you!\". That was SO rude! This film is running hot and blowing cold! So cold that Rachel Kellers brat son has hypothermia! Yes, the winner takes it all, and these losers are gonna have to fall...down that stupid well! That was SO rude! The story goes to say, Samara is not finished with the Kellers, and all because she needs a \"Mommie Dearest\" to slap her around and play house. Her intentions are for a strong and unfortunately good Watts to fulfill this, while poor Aiden Keller sits in a paper bathtub crying \"Help, I'm drowning, and I can't get out!\" Next we have people dying because they suspect the worst, before realizing the truth. That is SO rude! What is this? \"Omen III: The Final Conflict\"? That is SO rude. Watts tried, but failed, The film lacks in logic and creation, and those stupid CGI reindeer from hell are synthetically injected for some scare that we already saw in \"The Omen\". Watts is a brilliant actress, and I will like to see her in many more films, redeeming this mush, and that won't be too hard, and all can see that this film is so RUDE! ..............Because.............. Rachel got run over by a reindeer! While driving to her house one foggy noon. You can say there's no such thing as Samara, but as for me I thought it was rather soon. Too soon to be rushed. Yes Rachel got run over by a reindeer, when Aiden came down rocky with a cold. Rachel tried to keep him in her care but, the doctor of the city had been told...and Rachel got run over by a reindeer, she slipped and broke her neck down in that well, you can say this film was extra special, but I sure want this film to go to ..."

        "review_title": "The Ring Two Features More Of The Creepy Samara And An Instant Classic Reindeer Scene!",
        "review_detailed_main": "The Ring Two starts off pretty much where The Ring left off. Rachel (Naomi Watts) and Aidan (David Dorfman) are starting over again after all the horrors of the first movie are, for the time being, finished. It is not long before some events, which are not so coincidental, start to occur. Rachel, as the new editor of a small town newspaper, listens to the police scanner to what may be the biggest story to ever hit this small town. It seems a teenager has been murdered with his girlfriend cowering in the basement, but that is not the strange thing. It is something about the murder victim's face! Rachel decides she has to see if the events are related to what she has just been through and goes to see the corpse. To her dismay, the face resembles those who have died before. This is how the story begins and the evil Samara begins to show her face again, after she finds Rachel.\n\nThe Ring Two is not as mysterious as the first. That is easy to figure out, most of the questions were answered in the first, so it leaves more \"meat and potatoes\", so to speak, for the sequel. You get to see much more of Samara. Boy, does she look creepy crawling out of that well. You will see what I mean. This installment relies much more on imagery, such as the tree we all recognize from the first movie and who will ever be able to forget the instant classic scene with the reindeer or the moose (not sure what they were).\n\nThe fact is, I never expect much with sequels so I was pleasantly surprised by this one. While it is not as good, or original as the first movie, it is no slouch and far better than the last horror movie I saw, Boogeyman. No comparison whatsoever. I give 8 of 10 stars."

        "review_title": "Terrible, Terrible, Terrible",
        "review_detailed_main": "I think something got lost in translation. I'm pretty sure Hideo Nakata, director of the original \"Ringu,\" was hired to make a scary sequel to the hit 2002 horror movie \"The Ring,\" but... he didn't. In fact, what he did deliver to the powers at Dreamworks was an absolutely terrible comedy of horrors that undoes everything in the previous movie while simultaneously making the audience wish that they themselves were drowning in the bottom of that damn well. \"The Ring Two,\" titled such because Nakata evidently doesn't know that you can use a single character to depict a number, starts off exactly like the last one, with two bad actors plugging in the infamous videotape where at least one will eventually die. The horrid death, which conveniently isn't shown to us for the sake of a PG-13 rating (yet more was shown in the previous movie, which was also rated PG-13), just happens to occur in Astoria, Oregon, the far and distant land where Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) and her son Aidan (David Dorfman) have escaped to all the way from Seattle. A good two hour drive from the place where they almost perished under the hand of the creepy Cousin It ghost in the first film, Rachel is looking to start a new life. Unfortunately for her, Samara (the creepy Cousin It ghost) has found her and has decided that she should be like every other creepy kid ghost in the history of cinema and possess Aidan. The rest of the plot really doesn't matter, since none of it makes any sense and \"The Ring Two\" is easily one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. Watts does an adequate job in the lead, which is about the only highlight of the entire film. Unfortunately, since \"The Ring Two\" is rated PG-13, there should be no expectations that she will do any of the stuff she did in \"Mulholland Dr.,\" even though she does tease all the guys in the audience by asking her son if he wants her to get in the tub with him. Unfortunately, while her performance is bearable up until the climax (and definitely not during the climax), her character is so freaking stupid it's amazing she doesn't die in the first five minutes. After all, she knows Samara has returned for them, yet when Aidan has a nightmare that he refuses to share with her, his temperature drops five degrees and he starts acting really weird, she still is entirely clueless to what's going on. Of course, little Mr. Dorfman is weird and creepy anyway, so maybe that's her excuse. No excuses can be given for Dorfman himself, however, who is absolutely terrible here. He was okay in the first \"Ring\" and I liked him in \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,\" but he is ridiculously God-awful in this sequel. It doesn't help that the screenplay gives him the worst lines of dialogue known to man, many of which involve saying his mother's name over and over again. Yes, he says \"Rachel\" exactly 5,432 times in the movie. The most blame has to be placed on Nakata, film editor Michael Knue and the special effects team responsible for the truly horrific visuals in the movie. Nakata has quite possibly put the final nail in Asian horror for me, as I have completely lost interest with the flash-images-until-we-get-one-that-scares-some-idiot-in-the-back-row method. \"The Ring Two\" is slow, dull and uninteresting, with a plot that seemingly has no connection to the original and editing that exemplifies the editor's experience - let's see, he's done such great movies as \"Bones,\" \"Highlander Endgame\" and \"The Crow: City of Angels.\" Had Knue successfully edited 100 minutes out of the middle of the movie, \"The Ring Two\" might have been halfway decent. Despite its badness, \"The Ring\" is tense at times. The first twenty minutes are mildly engaging, although even then it was quite apparent things were only going to get worse. However, there is one pivotal moment where \"The Ring Two\" changed from a lackluster sequel to an all-out piece of sh*t. The deer. There are deer in this movie - a whole lot of them. Unfortunately, they're all computerized, they all look really fake, and they all attack Rachel's car. Yes, a bunch of cheesy-looking deer attack the car. Instantly, I lost all interest in the movie and began to see it for what it really is - an unintentional laugh-fest. Yes, most of the audience laughed at the deer. And yes, most of the audience laughed at the scene where a very fake CGI version of Samara floated over the bathtub. And yes, for the last half of the film the audience was checking their watches, their cell phones and even sun dials in hopes that their misery would finish sooner than later. Sadly, it was not to be. \"The Ring Two\" is one of the worst big budget horror movies I have ever seen. Boring, stupid and hardly scary, this is not a good first step for Nakata in Hollywood. In one scene, Samara forces a psychiatrist to inject herself with air and thus kill herself; by that point, I was jealous of the psychiatrist. I wish my fate was as pleasant as hers."

I personally liked some of the references to Dark Water (Rachel being copy editor--except for a newspaper--, the constant use of water and references to the sea) and the Japanese Ringu 2 (some of the premise of the film and the general image for most of the climactic scene). I thought Sissy Spacek was quite convincing as Evelyn and I think that Max (new love interest) was much hotter than Noah. The acting was slightly more refined, and I guess it might have just been the fact that creepy people walked into the nearly empty theater nearer the end of the film, but it had points that really left me creeped out."

The original Japanese \"Ringu\" was excellent, but the sequel was very disappointing. What can I say about a remake of a disappointing movie? Surprisingly, it is not so bad as it could be, basically because I am a fan of the dyed Naomi Watts, who has a good performance. Although having a leading role, the inexpressive David Dorfman is simply awful, and the screenplay is full of holes, as if it were a Suisse cheese. For example, when Dr. Emma Temple, the character of Elizabeth Perkins, dies, the boy leaves the hospital, and absolutely nothing happens: no social service or police looks for the boy. Max Rourke (Simon Baker) dies and is completely forgotten the rest of the story. However, there are some scary special effects making \"The Ring Two\"a watchable and forgettable unnecessary remake of an average film. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"O Chamado 2\" (\"The Calling 2\")"

And although we never learn what happened exactly, we are to presume they have broken Aiden's curse by placing it upon someone or even several people. A dark sub-plot that is mentioned briefly several times, this fact has been troubling the mother and son.\n\nBut they want to start over, and have been living well. Rachel has a new job and Aiden is seems to be doing better. But this does not last. A teenager is murdered and Rachel suspects the vengeful spirit of Samara is involved. (An importent note: The murdered teen is the lead character of the short film \"Rings\" which reveals that there are so called 'rings' or groups of people who pass around the cursed video, recording anything they see after viewing it, trying to learn it's secrets.) As the film progresses, it becomes apparent that Aiden is the target of Samara, who takes hold of him fairly early on. The rest of the film is a dark investigation into Samara's true past, and what has to be done to stop her once and for all.\n\nThats the plot in a nutshell. But as I said before, people have a tendency not to like this film. And I do believe the problem is the lack of sophistication in film audiences nowadays.\n\nMany reviews I have read (Both professional critics and online fan-reviews) all point to different reasons as to why this film was not as good as the original. Some say that it simply isn't scary, which is true in a way. However, the film doesn't seem to be going for sheer scares. It wants to be suspenseful and emotional... not watered down into a pure fright-fest. Other people say the plot is weak and that there is a lack in storytelling. Again, I cannot speak for everyone, but there was definitely power in what I saw. It was a story of a mother willing to do anything and everything to save her son... Even if it means what could be her own death, and the death of others. Very powerful in it's own respect. And another final complaint is that the film is different than the original. I cannot argue with this, because that is the whole point. The story to this film and it's keys are different than the original.\n\nAnother interesting thing to look for is the symbolism and connections that both \"Ring\" films have. Water, reflections, and simple noises take on deeper meanings.\n\nBringing on the director of the original Japanese film, \"Ringu\" (Hideo Nakata) was also a good choice. He seemed to add another layer, different from Gore Verbinski's first film. And the writer of both films, Ehren Kruger, again proves that he has a knack for suspense.\n\nOverall, I felt this film was just as good, if not better than the original. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys suspenseful and emotional stories, or anyone that enjoys a good film in general."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have now seen \"Ringu\" but still its remake, the first \"Ring\" is one of my favorite horror movies. It was quite scary, got enough suspense in its atmosphere and the story was really unique and interesting. \"The Ring Two\" opens up with Rachel and her son Aidan moving at Astoria to start life afresh. But the creepy spirit of Samara with the videotape comes back into their lives.\n\nIn this film, the story focuses on more details about Samara's past and instead of answering questions, it raised new questions and ultimately leaving them unanswered. The story got more complex with new ideas popping up now and then. The new method of contact between Aidan and Samara is the worst example. Aidan's role in this film is more elaborate and holds the major key of the story. Still these ideas fail to leave mark on the viewer's mind.\n\nThe most important drawback of this film that it's not scary enough. The chilly atmosphere of the first film is markedly absent. Yes, there are one or two jolt scares but they are quite sub-standard and often laughable (e.g. the horde of deer in the highway). Even the spine-chilling piano score of the first film is missing here. I have already mentioned the rather confusing screenplay. I believe the story should have been better-written, by incorporating more suspense and scary scenes instead of wasting time to make it unnecessarily elaborate.\n\nFor the acting, Naomi Watts again does a wonderful job. One more \"Ring\" (a far-fetched idea, I know) and she'll be identified with the character every time. For Dave Dorfman, the first film was about imitating Haley Joel Osment of 'Sixth Sense'. Here he starts off fine, with more easy and open approach, then he suddenly goes Damien... if you know what I mean. The supporting cast featuring Sissy Spacek and Elisabeth Perkins are also fine. I wish to write a few words about Perkins in particular but I see that I can't without spoiling a major part.\n\nTo summarise, \"The Ring Two\" had a promising beginning and if the premise could be better utilised, it could have been another great horror film. But it stopped really short. And considering the fact that it is directed by Nakata of \"Ringu\", that is a major disappointment."

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw this at a press-viewing in Stockholm this week. I must admit that expectations were not really high. I have to say that Asian horror almost always fails to excite me. Simply because it's not scary enough, the \"restless spirit\"-theme is just not very frightening to me. So a Japanese director doing an American remake of his own movie didn't feel that hot. And that feeling stuck with me when the movie was over.\n\nIf you have seen the first \"The Ring\"-movie you should be quite familiar with the story of the evil video tape killing people. Here Rachel (Naomi Watts) from the first movie discovers that it's not as easy as it seemed to get away from the horrors of the tape. She has moved away to escape it, but it follows her and interferes in her life again.\n\nWhat mostly disturbed me with this movie is how predictable it is. Most of the shock-effects are tired and over-used clich\u00e9s that completely failed to scare me. What Hideo Nakata does is build tension with both music and imagery, then ruining everything by ending each sequence with a loud noise or such. Cheap effects trying to make you jump in your chair. I honestly expected better from this. Also it feels like Naomi Watts is not trying very hard here, maybe she realized what a bore this was turning into? I felt the first \"The Ring\"-movie had it's points. It wasn't a masterpiece in any way, but at least it was original and had some nice touches. This is basically the same movie done once again, with more tired effects and the originality down to zero.\n\nI guess this might still have some enjoyment to offer for the hardcore fans of the genre. But everyone else i urge to stay away since this feels very tired and uninspired. And sometimes even downright silly, which is about the worst thing a horror movie can be. I rate this 2/10."

Only to be another boring, uninspired, and barely scary rendition of a scare movie. One part that should have brought a jump and a scare made me laugh and shake my head and say to myself, the scare is gone. Such a bummer this film was so poor. The first film was truly scary, and kept you on the edge of your seat, and when the end came it ripped you out of your seat. The Ring 2 makes you want to get out of your seat and leave. Too Bad.."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Ring was a surprise hit back in 2002. It charted new territory that no other horror movie had ever crossed paths before. However, the filmmakers of the first hit, decided they make rake in a few extra bucks with a sequel to it. Unfortunately, disappointment, is to be expected with this somewhat depleted sequel.\n\nThe story was interesting, and would have been better for a completely different movie, meaning, had there been no first 'Ring', this would have been the perfect script for a different movie entirely.\n\nThe plot was a bit slow, and although the film itself wasn't so much, it still lacked the same amount of pisaz, that the first one carried.\n\nNaomi Watts starred in this as well as the first, and instead of taking place in Seattle, WA, the mother and son duo, have moved to Astoria, OR. The cinematography was right on, and all the shots that they managed to get (outdoor) were very true to the Astorian look.\n\nHowever, cinematography aside, a picture still needs a good subject line and story to hold one's attention, and this did not.\n\nI will admit that there were parts which were good and scary, however they were few and far between, and left you feeling disappointed, that you weren't able to get the same amount of fear as in the first film.\n\nIt would have been hu of the director, and other filmmakers on board with the first project, to have stayed away from making a sequel. Everyone knows, that a good sequel is about as rare as a sober Frat party on new year's eve.\n\nI gave the film a six, because as sequels go, this was certainly better than a lot, and I will give Naomi Watts credit for her role in this. She was excellent, if not better than in the first, and the little boy who plays her son was equally good as she. He will more than likely supersede her career not long from now. He is quite a talent, at such a young age.\n\nIf you enjoyed the first one, don't be surprised if this doesn't blow you out of the water like the first one did. However, if you want to revisit the same characters, and see a special appearance by Sissy Spacak, then perhaps this is the film for you. Otherwise, take my advice, and stick with the first one. It's still a good watch, no matter how many times you see it."

        "review_detailed_main": "The sequel to 2002's The Ring, itself a remake of the Japanese film Ringu, is pretty well done, sacrificing only some logical consistency for the sake of shiver-inducing atmosphere, solid and believable acting, and an underlying sense of dread, if not despair.\n\nThe movie picks up a few months after the events in the original, with Rachel (Naomi Watts) toting her young son Aidan (David Dorfman) from Seattle to Astoria, a small town in Oregon, hoping to Start Over as so many horror-movie survivors before her have attempted. Naturally, the big bad tape that caused so much trouble the first time around follows her up there, as she fortuitously discovers while in the employ of the local newspaper.\n\nThe Ring Two was directed by Hideo Nakata, who directed the Japanese original (and its own sequel), and under his direction the movie has only two speeds - deadeningly slow, whereupon the viewer feels as apprehensive as the movie's heroine, and screamingly, bracingly quick. This pacing is a huge asset to what's otherwise a slightly better-than-mediocre film. A good recent comparable film is Skeleton Key, which also features a smart, sexy young blonde heroine (Kate Hudson), although there's no underlying theme of child endangerment.\n\nWatts is fantastic, but the true shining light of the film is Dorfman, who at twelve years old appears to have all the poise and none of the hubris of most adult actors. He and Watts interact very well together; that they are mother and son is eminently believable, and their chemistry lent plenty of gravitas to the movie. The real question is whether Dorfman can successfully make the transition into adult roles, but luckily that decision is still a few years off.\n\nStill, despite the fine work turned in by Watts and Dorfman (and, to a lesser extent, Sissy Spacek), there were enough \"What the heck?\" moments to give one pause. Most of them are integral to the plot, so I won't discuss them here, but general one sticks out: Even though Rachel states over and over that everything she does is for her son, she makes some questionable mothering decisions. There are also steps she takes that cause one to wonder why she hadn't taken them earlier in the film, when it would make more sense to.\n\nEven so, the movie never seems to deal in horror clich\u00e9s, such as various unnecessary characters going into dark basements or attics. It also doesn't merely replay the events of the original film, a cop out many horror sequels seem to use (or, in the case of the worst of the lot, a mere rethinking of ways for youngsters to die). Rachel and Aidan are flawed, but with depth; Rachel in particular is well developed because she's able to convey the sense of protecting her child, even to the point of considering the ultimate sacrifice to save his skin.\n\nI look forward to seeing more Hideo Nakata movies - he appears to have three coming out next year."

Something terrible happens, and the main character from the first Ring, the journalist Rachel, goes to see if it is the work of Samara. Indeed it is, and Rachel and her son, Adian, are once again haunted by the creepy little girl. However, this time, they didn't watch a tape, so the similarity ends there. Did they not succeed in escaping the course of the videotape after all? Or is it something... far more sinister?\n\nThe Ring 2 is not as scary as the first one, but it comes close.

        "review_detailed_main": "***SOME BIG SPOILERS - so read with extreme care (or with extreme gratitude that I saved you 2 hours of your life that you'll be able to better use in benefit of your family, your community or place of worship).***\n\n\"THE RING TWO\" is is truly one of the laziest horror films of this or any year. It shamefully exists only for the sake of milking another $10 out of the poor saps who enjoyed (or understood) the first film.\n\nI had no expectations for this movie, but say what you will about the first film - it did maintain a creepy tone through most of its running time, and its goofy psychobabble was at least palatable in the whatever-it-takes-to make-this-work mode. The sequel unfortunately, has no desire to flesh it's bare-bones plot out or explain anything that happens outside of it's narrow focus of two main characters.\n\nIs this the best sequel idea the screenwriter could come up with? Naomi Watts again stars as Rachel, the lone survivor of an evil videotape who, by merely watching what's on that tape, kills its viewer. Part Two actually dispatches that gimmick with 20 minutes of its opening (!), and instead cobbles together what amounts to a backstory piece that picks up with Rachel and son Aidan's move from Seattle to picturesque Astoria, Oregon to start a new life. Soon though, the undead spirit from the first film reappears to lie claim to Rachel's son through a series of not-entirely-understandable \"shock\" sequences that lead to a cyclical revelation of horror repeating itself.\n\nLogic seemingly goes out the window as soon as the Dreamworks logo appears on screen. With \"The Ring's\" evil specters again unleashed, wouldn't any of the locals in the small town - that one character describes its most newsworthy events as \"...a school board meeting, a car accident or a cat up a tree...\" - be all a-twitter? Considering that the body count increases as the film progresses in highly public places without so much as a police investigation, front page headline or a neighborhood revolt is the kind of lame bedrock this film is built on. Watching this, I saw huge dollops of \"Poltergeist 2: The Other Side\" in this with its journeys into the spirit world - and a sequel to \"Poltergeist\" isn't exactly a hotbed of movie concepts to begin with. If you were at the screenplay-regurgitation factory, why not at least crib a good scary premise from a good film, say like \"Videodrome\" or something and build on it? Even \"Halloween 3\" could have given this film's screenplay a few more scary beats than it has.\n\nCharacters do audience-insulting, idiotic things as crutches to ratchet up some tension - such as leaving a lethargic child alone in a tub AND THEN LEAVING THE HOUSE (!) or taking plenty of time to stop and watch a herd of deer attacking you in your car... over and over! Instead of capitalizing on the original's spooky teaser premise of the possibility of a worldwide pandemic of \"Ring\" video viewing - as well as that film's not-so-subtle commentary of the unknown evils that flow into your living room through consumer products - the sequel goes off in borderline-tasteless takes on the serious malady of post-partum depression and child abuse. Some fun.\n\nThis movie has no shame whatsoever. It contains absolutely NO scares, and in fact goes out of its way to throw in every cheap \"jump\" in the book just to make it \"feel\" like it's a horror film. There's the surprise-scare-from-behind, the it's-only-a-dream, the it's-not-dead, the jump-up-corpse... you know, every hackneyed trick in the book. The special makeup work provided by effects master Rick Baker gets two or three-second PG-13 showcases that don't titillate, but confuse. In a fright movie like this, you do have the license to linger a little longer on the macabre, right? Not in this movie - the scares are safe enough to guarantee that your little sister and her friends can see this on Saturday night and not have to sneak in from \"Ice Princess\" next door.\n\n\"THE RING TWO\" is all over the map acting-wise. Watts seems to be catatonic through most of the film, with a range that goes from confused to pretend-scared, while her overly-pancaked son Aidan played by young David Dorfman seems both possessed and cardboard all in the same go. The film tries to \"class\" itself up by throwing in cameos by legitimately fine actors like Sissy Spacek, Elizabeth Perkins and Gary Cole for one or two scenes that are as distracting as they are embarrassing to watch. Did these actors really need to be in this film? What was the director's motivation for hiring such good actors for such insignificant parts? I hope the three got paid well for the one day each put in and maybe did something fun with the cash.\n\nYes, it's only a movie, but the resulting \"product\" does the unconscionable: it rips it's audience off and sends them out the other side poorer and less entertained - suckered in by the goodwill earned from the first film. It also manages to give sequels an even worse name than they already have. Burn its audience with a few more of these and maybe Hollywood will be up for making some original, challenging and thoughtful horror films again."

        "review_title": "\"The Ring Two\" is an excellent continuation, not sequel, to \"The Ring\"",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Ring Two\" stars Naomi Watts and David Dorfman reprising their roles as Rachel and Aiden Keller, a family plagued by Samara Morgan, a demon child that created a video tape after death that showed horrifying images and killed the viewers seven days after they watch it. The original was met with great praise, labeled by critics as the scariest movie since \"The Exorcist\" and \"Rosemary's Baby\", even though I didn't find it scary at all, just a good mystery. In \"The Ring Two\", Rachel and Aiden have moved to a new town, and evidence arises that a local death may have been caused by a mysterious video tape. This inspires Rachel, a reporter, to investigate.\n\nMost critics don't like this film because it doesn't have the \"atmosphere\" of the original. Since I've read the books and now how vastly different the first is from the second, I didn't expect it to. You can't expect it to, anyway, seeing as how they have two different directors. I'm quite sure this movie would have been better if Gore Verbinski had been on to direct, but the studio hired the director of the Japanese film. It didn't work for \"The Grudge\" and it didn't work for this, but it turned out better than what I expected.\n\nIn \"The Ring\" the mystery of the video tape was revealed, including where it came from and the history of who made it. (Though I will admit, they could have explained it better. The book does.) In \"The Ring Two\", we know what there is to fear so all there is left to do is throw it at us and see what happens. They try something new though, that slightly resembles what occurs at the very end of the book, but is much different and happens in the middle. I didn't like how they just threw the idea of Samara being adopted at us. I wish they had explained it. They also kind of overexagerated on the water. After a fact about the villain is later revealed, it kind of makes sense but not really. I just hope fans react to \"Dark Water\" well when they see it. I also really liked the scene at the end with the well. There seems to be a scene like that at the end of both of them, one that shocks you and makes you flip out. (The first being where she crawls out of the TV.) All in all, it was a very cool movie, one of the better ones I've seen recently. I'd give it 10/10 because it did everything I thought it should. They did close it off, but I still expect a third. Why wouldn't they do it?"

        "review_detailed_main": "After seeing the trailer for The Ring 2 I expected it to be similar to the first re-make. I was wrong. This film is not a horror movie and I don't think it pretends to be either. it is more of a supernatural thriller/mystery. The reason why the first movie was so scary was because of the feeling of dread it gave you, you knew something was going to happen even if not what. The second movie is different. You know who the \"bad guy\" is now, you know how she gets you and you know your face is going to be messed up so there cannot be any major scares there. What the film does is makes you wonder how to beat her. A sensible person would throw away their TV but this is the movies and it's a little more complicated than that.\n\nDo not go to see this movie if you want similar scares as the first one but do go if you want to learn more about Samara and her origins. People who say that it's not as good as the first movie are wrong, it's different to the first movie. There's tons of imagery in The Ring 2, most of which you'll recognise. The scene in the bath-tub is breathtaking and the final scene gives the movie the ending it deserves. Watts (as usual) is excellent but it's her son this time who steals the show. I urge everyone to make up their own minds about this fantastic sequel. Don't expect to be terrified but do expect to be amazed by the brilliant camera work and twisted plot."

It's like Scream when every opening starts with a phone call. Anyway, what happened in the sequel? Well, much happened. They made a new story and a developed continuation to The Ring, but it could have been better. First of all, I think the suspense could have a much better build up, the atmosphere didn't feel the same, either. It wasn't that scary this time. I think that's lame because The Ring did such a good job with the mysterious feeling, jump-scares, and fear. It was disturbing and holding, and the sequel lost that, unfortunately. They tried to do some different plot twists here and there. They tried to develop Samara's story some more, make it more interesting, and well, it was fine, but it wasn't needed. It was cool that Rachel and Aidan (The main characters) returned, but I saw that they played weaker here. The emotions and performances weren't the same here, and the dialogues given to them were on a mediocre level. In the end, The Ring Two didn't feel needed. It felt more like if it was just pushed in for the sequels sake. But they didn't have to do it. They could just leave The Ring as a stand alone, and that would be perfect. Expending the story isn't always the best thing, and besides, the first part was so well developed anyway. No, I can't recommend The Ring Two, it was basic, and fans of the first one will clearly see the difference."

I was actually hoping she would off everyone early and efficiently, to spare everyone involved in this movie the embarrassment of having made such a clunker.

        "review_detailed_main": "Today I saw this movie as a premiere in a \"Ring marathon\" organized by an Amsterdam movie theater. It pleasantly surprised me that the first part again did not fail to sent shivers all over (I previously saw it as a sneak preview when it came out). People often expect sequels to be solely-profitable-meant and kind of cheap extracts. I think in the case of The Ring two, the producers really did their best to make a good story and to provide some pretty heavy scares again. Perhaps unexpectedly, this movie really tries to further build upon the basis of the first one and tries to explain some items left unexplained in the first movie. This has been done quite well.\n\nObviously, there are some flaws. Why, for example, would the door to a cellar be covered with spiderwebs if all furniture was moved in there the day before? Also, quite a few questions are still left unanswered. I feel there is certainly room for a third part. In case such is produced, I will definitely go and see it.\n\nHint: if you have not seen the first part, you should really take the opportunity to do so now. Unlike with, for example, final destination 2, with The Ring 2 I would strongly recommend to watch its prequel. If you have already seen The Ring, you should probably refresh your memory before you go and see part 2.\n\nThis is definitely a movie to watch in a cinema, hoping there are no giggling ladies (and gentlemen) around."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Ring\" was a rarity--a truly eerie modern horror film that got nearly everything right that it needed to get right. \"The Ring Two,\" while still certainly a step above many horror films, misses as often as it hits.\n\nThe script seems like a series of dramatic sequences connected by very quick and all too easy thriller segments. Rachel very quickly finds any information she sets out to find and quickly solves each immediate crisis, leaving much of the movie to be filled by the drama of the psyches of Aidan and Rachel and Rachel's struggle with making herself perform some actions. So the film doesn't really play as the horror film it presents itself to be, but rather as a disconnected drama; but it's not bad in that respect--Aidan was already an interesting character in the first film and he becomes considerably more complex in this one and Rachel's development is quite interesting. It's major weakness is that Samara is not explored much. She just sort of is what she is and that's it without any real rhyme or reason, even though we get hints that we're going to find out. There are also a few plot points that are only vaguely explained (the deer in the forest are explained only by the appearance of some antlers later, for example).\n\nHideo Nakata's direction is also uneven. While a few moments are done with a positively chilling correctness, such as the camera's march toward Rachel in the Morgans' basement, it often seems we are getting odd angles just for oddness's sake and worse, a few moments look downright cartoonish (especially the upward-flowing water in the bathtub scene and the deer in the deer scene). The cartoonishness is really a disappointment because it just jolts a viewer (or at least me) out of the world of the film. Also sadly disappearing from the original was the terribly eerie greenness of that film--the green color of the entire film gave it an edge of otherworldliness and sickness that was quite missing in Nakata's more standard blue-tinted film. That green color is to me the signature of \"The Ring\" and perhaps its single strongest element, and its loss is similarly terrible.\n\nThis time, Naomi Watts is ironically given a bit less to work with as an actor, but succeeds in what she has. However, David Dorfman was a huge shock to me, performing a depth and range in his portrayal of Aidan Keller that is quite simply beyond the capabilities of an average child actor or even many good ones. Dorfman's character moves beyond the rather simplistic kid who was forced to grow up too fast of \"The Ring\" into a far more complex and more damaged child, and he seems more than up to the challenge. We may have a star in the making here. Perhaps equally surprising is the small performance of Sissy Spacek, who was unrecognizable and whose performance was as believable as any in the film. Gary Cole's appearance is also noteworthy because it is simply so different from his niche--one of the world's greatest creeps plays an affable if a bit slippery real estate agent with a charm and energy that I would never have expected.\n\nIn short, \"The Ring Two\" is an uneven disappointment, but in that disappointment still surpasses average horror fare. David Dorfman stands out as an actor for all the right reasons and Hideo Nakata stands out as a director for mostly the wrong reasons (if \"Ringu\" looked like this, too, I'm quite certain I'm glad I saw \"The Ring\" instead). Still, it has its share of cheap thrills if that's what you're looking for and some truly interesting drama, so it's not a complete loss."

I have little faith in sequels, especially in the horror genre, and this movie only cements my opinion.\n\nI found myself yawning and struggling to stay awake due to the slow paced plot (very welcome in the first film, in that it was well-developed) and never felt the sheer creepiness I was smothered with in the first film.

The Ring was a brilliant mystery with a truly unexpected ending. Although I did not find it scary, it was well written, innovative and unique.\n\nThis movie does not have a real plot. The writer is confused and has no idea where the story is going. The director seems to be rather confused and unable to decide what he wants to do. Many of the shots are cut off too quickly, and the only jumps are at the first ten minutes. The actors seem equally confused and the only decent performance is from the amazing Sissy Spacek.\n\nI can't advise someone to not see this movie. Even though you may be disappointed, there are a few good parts at the beginning. Also, the real reason to see it is to simply satisfy your curiosity. But don't expect much, because this movie does not deliver.\n\nWith everything that happened, one would expect the ending to have been as inspiring as the first movie. Absolutely not. The 'solution' is so stupid that it leaves you actually hoping for the 'final comeback' from the bad guy. I won't say whether or not that comes, but all in all it was very poor and in line with The Grudge and Boogeyman as some of the lamest horror films of all time.\n\nSad to say, it actually seems like Rob Zombie is the only horror director left with any guts. And although I don't care for his films, at least he understands his genre. All the horror masters (except for George Romero) have lost touch with what truly makes a film scary. It's sad."

Rather I was disgusted by the plot. It really didn't tie in at all and I'm afraid that does not interest me then. As I saw the second movie with a few friends of mine who liked the first one, I went into the movie thinking I'm going to hate this. And I know going into the movie with a bad mood would result in a bad opinion. But as the movie started and eventually built up, things just seemed to be so clich\u00e9. For a moment, at the beginning I thought I was watching Scream and when the phone rang I turned to my friend and said, \"What's your favorite scary movie?\" This movie is also DRENCHED in foreshadowing. Even when the child psychiatrist came on, it was a foreshadowing of who the next big actor to come on the screen was. He just so happened to be Mr. Lumbar from Office Space. I thought that was terribly funny, mainly cause I was the only one that got it out of the theater but as soon as I told my friends, we had a riot. But what I got from the movie was that if there was no foreshadowing, there would be no movie. And that is not what a movie is about. Foreshadowing is great...especially for the Duh, Duh, Duuuh. But as the plot, no. I also didn't think the plot made sense. Like I understood the plot and everything made sense but as a critic, it didn't make sense as to why the plot existed. There should have been something in the movie that says there are reasons why you should watch this, not just for the thrill (which there was only one). Camera angles and shots were interesting though. At the very beginning, there were different camera shots of water that of course foreshadowed how to get rid of Samara. But there were so many of those shots, I started to get sick of seeing like bright sun on wavy water. There was also one shot of Naomi Watts with like a wavy water over it. I had to look away from the screen because it was making me nauseous. Acting wise, the actors were amazing. The new male lead was quite attractive and he had his moments where he shined bright. So this is my opinion of the The Ring 2, which I hope will help with people who are seeking an honest opinion of the movie."

That said this is still worth seeing, especially is you like the first one."

Everything everyone loved about the first one is not here.\n\nOriginally this was going to be a prequel/sequel of the first, but the Dreamworks studio decided that they should save the prequel for a possible THIRD Ring, this decision did not pleased the first choice of director, Noam Murro, so he leaved the project, meanwhile Dreamworks ordered a NEW script from Ehren Kruger, they also decided to bring Hideo Nakata, the director of both Ringu and Ringu 2, to direct the sequel.\n\nNaomi Watts contractually obligated returns, as well as David Dorfman, Daveigh Chase doesn't, because Dreamworks decided to use a stand-in for the Samara scenes.\n\nThe result is a mess, horrible and unneeded visual effects, flat characters and bad direction.\n\nWho is the responsible? we'll never know, because Hideo Nakata did changed some things of the script, but Dreamworks made some very stupid decisions.\n\nThis movie could have been a very good one, but it was not made to satisfy audiences, it was made to make quick cash, which sadly it'll do.\n\nNot even the excellent Naomi Watts could save this sequel, which is destined to be the worst horror sequel, since The Exorcist: The Heretic.\n\n4/10"

Not being a fan of horror movies, cold sweat broke out at the previews but I went anyway. And I don't regret it! After seen the American version, which was different in subtle details, Ring two begins where Ring one ends. The mother and her son had just copied the tape and flied to a different place. But soon, far too soon, kids start to die having the same distorted faces. But this time it is not only that Samara wants to be heart, she wants to LIVE, and had chosen the boy to do so. The only way to prevent this is also the only thing she is not prepared to do.\n\nThe speed of this movie is thrilling, and before you recover from the last shock, the next one is waiting. In contrary to the first Ring, which was scary, but had not much of a story, this one is more mysterious, and it unfolds before your very eyes. Of course there are some shock moments but try to look anyway, or else you miss the beautiful details of the movie. Especially the scene with the reindeer was mind-boggling. Go, see, and enjoy!"

But when a teen winds up dead and Samara's old M.O. seems to be behind it, Rachel must find a way to stop Samara and uncover her origins to save Aidan's life.\n\nHideo Nakata takes the reigns this time around. You think that with as good as his direction on the original Ringu was that it would at least be on par with that. Sadly it's not the case. There were a few cool sequences (the deer attack, the bath scene and a sequence in the well toward the end) but sadly the suspense is sorely lacking and the overall photography is a bit bland. The script is probably the weakest problem. They should have waited until they fully cooked up an interesting plot but what you get is a lot of derivative rehash and even the bits of Samara's origin just seems tired and not very well thought out. Watts goes through the paces as a mommy in peril and Dorfiman can play creepy kid like nobody else's business. I am very fond of the first one but the second one seemed cursed from the get-go. 6/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "When it comes to horror films, sequels are usually very dangerous propositions (just look at the Halloween or Saw franchises). Fortunately, director Hideo Nakata follows the original \"Ring\" tale with another frightening, mind-bending tale.\n\nFor a basic plot summary, \"The Ring 2\" sees Rachel (Naomi Watts) and Aidan (David Dorfman) on the run from the ghost of Samara. Of course, just when they think they are in the clear, the spirit of the long-haired little girl returns to wreak more havoc. While trying to put an end to Samara once and for all, Rachel must delve even deeper into her past to find the key to her destruction.\n\nThis movie is really a tale of two halves. The first half falls a bit flat because it is basically an extension of the original (visits from Samara, exposition about the haunted videotape, etc.). However, the second hour of the movie redeems itself by delving into more original material, that being the origins of Samara. By that time, the sheer creepiness of Samara was starting to get a little thin, so an origins tale was a good idea.\n\nOverall, \"Ring 2\" is a very satisfying sequel that breaks new ground while still managing to provide some genuine new scares. If not for a bit of a repetitive first hour, this part two would have eclipsed the original."

Since I was around people that I hardly knew, except for one person I didn't feel like it was my place to object so I decided, what the hell, I'll tag along.\n\nNow can someone explain to me how a scary movie can make you laugh? The cheesy dialogs, the bad acting, the cheesy dialogs, those stupid deers, and did I mention the cheesy dialogs? I'm not much of a scary movie fanatic, the only scary movies that managed to scare me were The Exorcist and the Shining. I've seen a fair amount of scary movies and most of them pretty much, how you say, blow. But this one...(and the first one)...they pretty much take the cake. OK, no scratch that, Darkness was worst.

The beginning was great because it picked up right where it left off. Towards the end, it all cuts off and the screen goes black. Do not fear, that was not the end. That would really suck if it was. The ending was pretty good and I don't expect a third. I think it will be way overdone if there is. There is still some great twists and turns to be figured out. It was worth my time and my money.

It has to be the worst movie I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. First the dialogue. The lines Naomi had to utter were so inane. It was pure formula. I can not imagine the pitch session for this turkey. The whole premise of calling her \"Mom\" vs. \"Rachel,\" was so obvious and blatant that a first grader would've gotten it after the first 2 seconds. The scares were not. There were no surprises in this film other then the cameo work of familiar actors who have all been in better films with much better dialogue and acting. Why Elizabeth Perkins stooped to appear in this bomb is beyond me. Sissy Spacek, in the worst wig since Elvira, is out right laughable. I would highly recommend anyone who wants to see this because the first one scared them, as it did me, to pass or wait until the DVD comes out and rent it and then utilize the fast forward button on their machine to bypass a really forgettable waste of celluloid."

This film for me has improved with age.\n\nAs a kid of the 90s, I was obsessed with the American remake of the Ring. I remember as a kid, not enjoying this sequel much at all. I found it was too different of a formula than the original would set you up for to expect. I didn't care for it.\n\nNow as an adult, my interest in this series has been rekindled entirely over the last several months. I found myself re-watching the American remake with a renewed interest, following it up by re-watching the Japanese versions of Ringu.\n\nI even did research on the book and the differences in the lore. Which led me to re-watch the Ring Two for the first time since release and give it a second opinion.\n\nI have to say I enjoyed this film far, far more now as an adult, that I can appreciate it so much more than I did as a kid. I think learning context behind the books and Japanese films really helped me appreciate Hideo Nakata's return to this series with this film.\n\nThe cgi has it's weaknesses, but the story for me was so much fun. Gripping, and unexpected. It's a different formula than the original film and I appreciate it so much more now that I could watch it with a refreshed eye.\n\nThe originals are so good and well paced that it's just difficult to live up to that formula in a story that progresses indefinitely.\n\nNow the parts I was not crazy about: The setting is not as aesthetic this time around, and neither is the editing, particularly towards the end, things could have used more set design and editing. The editing was lacking a bit of polish, but overall, this exceeded my expectations a second time around far more than I expected.\n\nI completely understand why this film won't live up to the expectations of the first one, but I find it has improved with age. The actors are creepy enough to give it life, and the plot somehow vile enough to disturb. Samara is even more sinister in this one, and sneakier.\n\nThere were chunks of the plot that went completely over my head when I saw this as a kid, and I only appreciate Hideo Nakata's efforts here even more now.\n\nI'm obsessed with this series and the Japanese ones and am glad I could revisit this one. The unrated version."

I guess you could argue that the situation with Samara would never have happened anyway because the paranormal isn't real, but even if that situation WAS real, then there are several events that just wouldn't have happened, such as the deer crowding around the car, and the kid standing in front of the mirror and taking loads of photos instead of just running away from the figure like any normal kid would.\n\nAnyway, despite it being somewhat unconvincing, I rated it 7/10 because it was still quite scary, and overall I would recommend it to people who have seen the first movie, simply because it is nice to continue the story."

I wouldn't say this was a bad movie, but I wouldn't recommend it."

The Ring 2 was bad in lots of ways I really wanted to see number 2 but now I wish I didn't because its a waste of time and money even if you get it for free its a big waste of time! But the good thing is that its not to predictable. I didn't expect what happened at the end would happen but there was a couple of creepy parts like the part where Samara was crawling up the well chasing Rachelle and when the boy looked in the mirror and saw Samara and started taking pictures of the mirror.

I cannot comment on RINGU or RINGU 2 cause I didn't see them but WOW...this film was bad, not the slightest bit creepy and it looked like a bad, low-budget 80's b-movie. I am an official movie addict with my favorite genre being HORROR so I rarely, almost never walk out of a movie but I had to leave this one. I could feel the minutes slipping away that I could be enjoying with my wife and one year old, so I left. I gave it a solid hour to bore me out of my mind, that's a fair chance...isn't it? Sometimes Hollywood feels if they put enough money into fire F/X and water dripping upwards F/X then a movie will be instantly creepy, well it doesn't always work. My hint to the filmmakers...try a good script and maybe a good director, like Gore Verbinski. For true scares and creepy chills rent the classic ghost story from 1979 starring George C Scott named THE CHANGELING. And so you don't feel so sorry for me, I did get money back...I said I had an important call and it worked. Thank you AMC theaters!"

The atmosphere is not really uplifting. The greatest goal of a Japanese director is not to make everyone walk out of a theater feeling happy. That's for Hollywood directors. This is not a stupid teen-movie, this is more or less a work of art. It is not made to make you feel good. It is meant to leave you scared en bewildered. And if it does so and you don't like that, you are missing the whole point of movie-making at all."

One of the better factors here is the fact that this one puts a nicer emphasis on the physical threat that was barely hinted at before. With the targets having survived from before and are well aware of what can happen, the sense of her looming over them from the start with the nightmares he keeps having or the hallucinations of the girl around the apartment trying to get at them which results in the appearance of the different portals to the alternate world she inhabits. That brings the other attacks she has, from the dream scare of appearing in the TV set to the chilling appearance in the bathroom as the manipulation of the water trinkets around the room for a strong chilling sequence and, into a rather strong and somewhat enjoyable series of scenes to highlight the supernatural threat present here. The other instances of supernatural activity here work nicely, as the deer attack on the car was pretty suspenseful, and while it was set up beforehand, it was still a shock to see it staged as well as the scene in the hospital that is pretty cool to watch. It's only other positive element is the ending twist was really surprising, and it comes off as one of the best scenes in the film, giving this enough to really hold itself up over it's few main flaws. The biggest factor against this is that the movie just doesn't scare at all. The few attempts at scares were telegraphed so far in advance that they missed the point entirely or the shock just wasn't effective to really register. That is perhaps the worst thing to happen to a film, which is that the scares it's attempting don't register. The film also had a whole heartlessness to it all that makes it feel like it was just made for no real reason. It wasn't that emotionally connected with anything, and that left the film feeling bland. Coupled that with no scares and only a couple weak action scenes along the way, this was just a dull movie. Abandoning the concept of the connection to the cursed videotape and turning into a dull, weak investigation makes for a wholly slow-going effort that rarely contains the wholesale ingredients of the series with that type of setup. With the added fact that the film is rated so low also being a weak sign, meaning that the scares, what little there are, and the violence being so tone-downed that any steam is effectively neutered by having to be scaled back in their intensity. This was all around a disappointment.\n\nRated PG-13: Violence, Language and children-in-danger."

        "review_detailed_main": "Here it comes, the long-awaited sequel to the one of the most overrated, but still watchable & pretty scary though, Japanese-gone-Hollywood horror 'The Ring'... But, oops! Something doesn't fit, something hasn't worked out... Something? Hmm... Everything in the movie fails! Let's admit it, the story of 'The Ring' was very very questionable! Huge plot holes were here & there. But compared to this masterpiece of human brain disorder - the first Ring's story was as well put together as it gets, since 'The Ring Two' hasn't got any kind of combination of logical thoughts on which the movie is based, which I could force myself to call with such a word as 'story'. 'The Ring Two' is just one huge gaping plot hole, featuring a bunch of stale clich\u00e9s & pitiful dialogs. Most of the parts, which were supposed to be horrifying were welcomed with viewers ironic laughter. Idiotic scenes in abundance here (just remember the sequence with the deers). OK, the direction is awful too! As you remember 'The Ring', despite above-mentioned plot holes was scary. As I think not only due to the writing, but mainly direction. The atmosphere of the film was heavy, dark, gloomy. Here we see quite the opposite: a lovely small town, optimistic view of the loony bin, even the house, where Samara used to live looks like a wonderful country home & not like a scary place it was in 'The Ring'. Seriously, even minors won't find a flick like this scary! The visuals... Well, to say that they are bad is to say nothing. The visuals are awful, truly primitive & not scary! Seriously the visuals in 'Charmed' look good compared to this one. Acting is as poor as it gets. Not believable: it is rather overacting we see or no acting at all. No acting at all is better I gotta say. Had this movie come out earlier, the Scary Movie 3 would've been totally unsuitable as a parody for 'The Ring'... Disgusting attempt to make more money by the studio bosses. Wait until the flick is on TV. It won't take long, trust me."

The plot was shallow, there was no scare factor and they drained the TV thing. It's just not scary any more. This was a major let down and when it boils down to it was one of the worse movies I've saw in a long time. It just plain bored me to the very end. The acting wasn't great especially during the deer scene which in it's self was a farce. To anyone who is a fan of the original 3 and even the first remake your going to be very very disappointed.\n\nThe ending was rather predictable and the film as a whole helps to discard of that x factor the previous ring films had. In my opinion they give far too much of the background away, taking away from the mystery surrounding the whole story. I'd recommend not going to see this film as you'll only end up disappointed."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I loaded the IMDb page for The Ring Two, the headlining comment at the time stated that it lacks everything that made the first American adaptation good. I agree with this sentiment. What makes it ironic is that Hideo Nakata, the esteemed director of Ringu, was brought in to direct this mess. The presence of one name in the credits, however, brings me to believe that the overall mess has to do with the screenplay. You guessed it, Ehren Kruger, the man who first came into prominence with Scream 3, wrote The Ring Two. Granted, he also wrote the first American adaptation of the Japanese Ringu films, but director Gore Verbinski was able to wrestle a decent final product out of his raw material. It appears that Hideo Nakata thought he was up to the task of wrestling a decent end product out of Ehren Kruger's writing. He proved himself quite wrong. The actors do the best they can, and David Dorfman does a lot less sleepwalking in this episode, but I believe this film can be credited with killing off any chance of further Ringu adaptations.\n\nOf course, the acting is good enough to pass muster, as was the case in the previous Ring. Naomi Watts is a surprisingly competent actor, given that her credits include a stint on the Australian soapie I like to call Please Go Away. Once again, she goes through the standard motions expected of a Scream Queen with championship pride. All the clich\u00e9s are present and accounted for, but she shrugs them off like she is right at home in her environment. Then again, when one has worked for David Lynch, I suppose even creepy scenes such as the emergences of Samara from the TV set seem routine. However, when you get right down to it, Watts is the only real star in the film. Much was made of Sissy Spacek's role in the film, but it has turned out to be one of the most overstated walk-ons in the history of the genre. It was not until I viewed the IMDb credits for the film that I was even aware of her appearance in the film. David Dorfman, as previously intimated, has been given less of a zombie-like appearance in this film, but in so doing, his character also becomes a lot less interesting.\n\nThe visual effects of the previous Ring were mainly limited to one instance of a girl crawling out of the television set, combined with some practical effects or trick editing. In this sequel, there are endless shots of water flowing in unnatural directions, people being sucked in and out of televisions, or people polymorphing. The plot feels like a blur, and I was only able to catch fragments relating to some lost relative of Samara's or how she is able to torment the family in spite of all the conditions being met in the first film for her to leave them be. In short, I was given little reason to care about the machinations that the central characters go through this time. Without a decent character to hang our cares upon, the film's sense of horror or terror literally falls apart. It does not help that we have no idea what the framework of rules regarding what Samara can or cannot do is meant to be.\n\nAs I said, a previous commentator has stated that The Ring Two lacks everything that made The Ring good. Suspense? It is on the cutting room floor. Terror? The framework for it was never there to begin with. Horror? It appears the director would not know it if they were formally introduced. New lead Simon Baker tries his best, but Martin Henderson, his equivalent in the first American film, was able to make us care about his character. Partly because the screenplay seemed to be coherent, but also because he is able to act the part without resorting to clich\u00e9. Simon Baker is swimming uphill against a director who does not seem to care about building a structured plot, and a screenplay that has him speaking so unnaturally it is a wonder he did not cough up a boot during his scenes with David Dorfman. No matter how I try, I cannot think up a simple cause and effect pattern to the events in the film. It is literally a collage of scenes that are meant to be horrifying, but have no framework on which to hang.\n\nIt is for this reason that I am giving The Ring Two a two out of ten. It is bad. Not bad enough to be good, but not good enough to be entertaining, either. It literally winds up in no man's land. See it if you can get it for free, but if there is something better on, such as a collection of You Can't Do That On Television repeats, watch that instead."

The story starts out really well as I said the plot is kind of simple but its set out so that it takes a while to see the whole picture. There are some parts with CGI effects that aren't needed. Half way through it gets really good, you don't know whats happening and you don't know how they're going to stop it. After that it gets a bit obvious and kinda hurried.\n\nOverall, see this film for your self. Yes movie doesn't offer you anything new as it seems copy of first part only but you will not regret watching it."

It has a unique directorial style and features a great performance by Naomi Watts, which doesn't seem rushed even though she didn't want to make the film due to a busy schedule. Unfortunately, the other bigger names in the film (Sissy Spacek, Simon Baker, Elizabeth Perkins) are nothing more than glorified cameos.

I mean, who in their right mind has this much faith in complete strangers... who cares how beautiful or innocent some country-folk look.\n\nI want to continue by saying \"I really liked this film.\" That may be hard to believe after you read what I'm about to say about it in this review...\n\nAmerican filmmakers--Horror filmmakers particularly--have always had the habit of adopting foreign film techniques and stories, and recycling them for the American market... This is nothing new, and it's not been a secret... Filmmakers copy from the French, the Japanese, et al. and we gleefully empty our pockets to get a gander at foreign product recycled, repackaged (and re-cast) for American eyes.\n\nWhich is to say that, to my understanding, the original Japanese \"Ringu\" DVD (or Video)can be found at your neighborhood Blockbuster and (to my understanding) was not released in American-soil theaters in its original Japanese version.\n\nSoon, we will truly and completely know who Naomi Watts actually is (if we haven't already met her in previous American-movie outings such as that 'Mullholland' movie directed by David Lynch) when she graces the big-screen in Peter Jackson's \"King Kong\" remake this December 2005. If we didn't hear her scream loud enough in \"The Ring\" or \"The Ring 2\", then we'll definitely hear her fictional-cries for help when a 40-foot-tall gorilla wraps its horny fingers around her lithe and winsome frame."

The story do continues from where it left in the first movie. As I saw the Ring last night, the Ring 2 was really natural in its line of story. 2. Good that they had the chance to work with the same kid and Rachel 3. The story of Samara girl is kinda explained further which is good, but then...\n\nI found it not so good that they did not explain the background story more. Also, I think the whole thing about coming into the house of your colleague from work and do feel like you're at your own was a bit ... unrealistic. Even more, that she did not do a single thing when he died! Also, the kid walks out of the hospital just like that and no one from there tries to find him?! I mean, there are several other minor things which were kinda off ... But, all in all, it is not that it makes this sequel less interesting and good. There were no suspense like there was in the original / first movie. That lowers the rating for this one ( I gave an eight for The Ring).\n\nIt is not bad, but it is not as good as the first one for sure. So, I'm gonna go with rating five!"

However, the soul of Samara is back with a bigger and scarier challenge for Rachel and Aidan who battle for their lives yet again.\n\nComment: Hideo Nakata, who made his American Debut with the \"The Ring\" based on Japanese \"Ringu\" has proved his scare value yet again. The Japanese scary flicks have provided inspiration for many other horror/thrillers across the world and this is no exception. Performances of Naomi Watts and David Dorfman carry you well through the movie. I think Dorfman was a notch better than the once-Oscar-nominated Watts. SFX are done seamlessly.\n\nAlthough the Screenplay is well written and is unpredictable, it could have been bettered upon to match the levels of the first Ring. Nevertheless, it's quite usual that sequels don't usually match up to the original. But this shouldn't deter you from watching the movie. The best executed scene is the bathtub one seen in the trailer. The unpredictability of the sequences can give real creeps!\n\nRating: 3/5"

The Ring Two, however, is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. The movie has a very thin plot, what little bit of plot their is doesn't really make sense and is scatterbrained, there's no flow to the movie and the editing was poor, there's very little interesting that happens, virtually everything is derivative of the first movie, the dialog is week, and even the acting is poor. No characters are developed in the movie at all; the mother and son were both developed in the first movie, and nothing new is added to what we know about them or their relationship. Even the son, who did a fine job of acting in the first movie, seems like he's all too conscious of how deadpan and serious he was in the first movie and is trying too hard to \"act\" a certain way in this movie; it shows. The only bright spots in the movie are Naomi Watts, who continues to be one of the best actresses around, and a few surprise moments (but they are very few). I really feel like I wasted my money. I found myself looking for the fast forward button. My closest comparison of how I feel is how I felt after seeing Highlander and then Highlander 2: forget Highlander 2 ever existed, which is exactly what the later Highlander movies and the TV show did. Forget about The Ring Two."

I also thought that David Dorfman did a wonderful job in this one. He was more believable in the second one then he was in the first one I thought. He is getting kinda old and in this one he was almost to old but he still pulled it off for me. I just wish they would have came out with the second one a little faster. In this one they never had to introduce anything or anyone so they got right down to the action right away. The end keeps you going and was done very good.

I really quite enjoyed The Ring 2, and even though it was in a totally different league to the original remake, i was entertained.\n\nWhy? Well, in The Ring, we got too little Samara for my liking, as she only really came into play in the last 10 or 15 minutes. But in the sequel, she comes back in good form and we see things from her perspective. The bit at the start (if you've seen it, you'll know what i'm talking about)after the opening scene made everyone in the room jump right out of their seats, an that impressed me, because i didn't see it coming. Sissy Spacek's cameo was a great treat at that point in the movie and she fits in well with the character.\n\nBut as with any movie, it has its flaws. For one, those ridiculous deer. They had the whole cinema in ructions of laughter, which really destroyed the atmosphere. Another qualm would be the fact that sometimes there can be a lapse in dialogue, where the actors struggle to deliver a badly written line, and its glaringly obvious when it occurs. But my main complaint is the general lack of fear. It doesn't take a lot to get me scared, but Samara failed to deliver the scares she rightly deserved, and for this, i felt a little ripped off.\n\nAll in all, like many sequels, The Ring Two is inferior to the original, but its by no means a bad film. The reason i think that its been getting such low marks is because its being compared to its predecessors. In comparison, its not so good, but as a stand alone, i think its an okay movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "As useless and unnecessary sequels go, The Ring Two isn't half bad. It has some interesting and surprising twists and a few visual highlights which keep you on your toes. Unfortunately, as a horror film, it isn't particularly scary. You can only show the dark-haired girl with the water-logged complexion so many times before the fright effect wears off.\n\nThe story picks up a few months after the events of the first film as Rachel (Naomi Watts) and her young son Aidan (David Dorfman) have moved to a small town in order to distance themselves from the horrors they experienced in Seattle. Unfortunately, as luck would have it (or sequels would), trouble has followed them there. A copy of the infamous videotape has shown up accompanied by the usual mayhem that results 7 days after viewing it. Of course, Rachel and her son are the only remaining experts on the phenomenon, and she is determined to bring the curse to an end.\n\nUnfortunately, Rachel's efforts only serve to further anger woman-child Samara Morgan, that plucky young ghost determined to punish everyone for her untimely death. It appears that Samara has now decided to return to the world of the living, using young Aiden as the destination vessel. This presents real problems for his mother who must alternately love and fear her only child.\n\nAdditional details of Samara's childhood are revealed as Rachel is determined to find out what motivates her. Rachel discovers that Samara's birth mother is still alive. A bit of stunt casting is involved here but I won't tell you who. However, the effect isn't quite as cool as the filmmakers probably intended.\n\nDespite the lack of genuine scariness, the film does have it's chilling moments. In particular, there is a scene involving an attack by wild animals that is both surprising and visually stunning. And, on occasion, Samara's grim form can evoke some real chills, especially a scene in which we see her scale the wall of the circular well in which she was originally entombed.\n\nNaomi Watts does a fine job portraying the plucky young mother determined to do anything to save her son. David Dorfman, as the beleaguered young Aiden, is called upon to do a bit more acting than the first film required, and I think he is well on his way to being a worthy second tier successor to Haley Joel Osment in the kid acting department. Simon Baker, from the TV series The Guardian, is on hand as Rachel's new boss. I find it interesting that two of the leading players are Australians pretending to be American, while the film's director is Japanese. Hideo Nakata was responsible for directing the original Japanese versions of The Ring and its sequel, known as Ringu and Ringu 2.\n\nAlthough not as scary as the original, this is still a pretty solid film, especially for a sequel. My grade: B-"

This time around, Hideo Nakata, the director of the original Japanese Ringu, was brought in. Naomi Watts and David Dorfman reprise their roles as Rachael and Aiden. This film was a true sequel in the sense that it does continue the story and not just repeat the same story again. Rachael took her son Aiden and moved from Seattle to start a new life in Astoria, Oregon. She now works as a reporter for a small newspaper there.\n\nWhen she investigates the death of a local teenage boy, she soon finds out that the notorious video tape was involved. Her nightmare is about to begin again! She goes to the house where the boy was killed to retrieve the tape which she burns. That evil girl spirit Samara is not content being a ghost. She wants to have a physical body and a mommy so she takes possession of Aiden.\n\nI felt this to be a decent follow up to the first film. While it doesn't capture the same creepiness and atmosphere of the first it does have its moments. Rainy, gloomy Astoria is a great location choice for such a film. I thought the scene in the restroom at the bazaar where Samara takes possession of Aiden was creepy. Also, the rather unique deer scene. Nakata and Kruger tried to give the audience a little more information on the background of Samara in this film, although it is all rather underdeveloped. In the previous, it was revealed that she was adopted. This time the identity of her real mother is revealed( played by the great actress Sissy Spacek) and why she gave her up. Although not as good as the original, this film does continue the story of Aiden and Rachael. Some of the effects from the first film such as the girl coming out of the t.v. just isn't as scary the second time around."

The Ring Two is The Ring chewed up and spit out by a different director, Hideo Nakata. Nakata directed the original Ringu, the film on which The Ring is based. You can see the different take the Japanese director has on the subject matter with this. Gore Verbinski, the director of The Ring, gave us suspense, atmosphere and some scares that haunted us. Nakata focuses more on the story than trying to get us to jump out of our seats.\n\nRachel (Naomi Watts) and Aiden (David Dorfman) have moved from Seattle in an attempt to start their lives over without the horror of the tape. But it appears that Samara has followed them when Rachel hears about the death of a teenage boy with a distorted face. In an attempt to put an end to it once and for all, she burns the tape and calls it a night. But no, no, no, it's not that simple. Samara is back and she wants something.\n\nSamara, although no longer played by the same girl, is as terrifying as we remember. She looks waxy, dead and demonic no matter what she does. She has as crawling under our skin in the same gross and disturbing way that she crawls from place to place. What is it about the demon child that scares us so? Is it the thought that innocence shouldn't be that evil? Whatever the strange phenomena is, it is the heart and soul of The Ring Two. The girl is the only thing that gets shivers to crawl up your spine and that's because you never saw very much of her in the first film. Here she is almost the main character. That is the problem with the sequel to a horror film. All the shocks of the original are already out in the open. We have already seen the distorted face (who can ever forget the first time they saw that?), we have already been in the bottom of the well and we have already been to the Morgan's house\u0085 There is nothing new to frighten us and that is maybe why Nakata chose to focus on developing parallels between Rachel and Samara's birth mom. He makes the story more of a mystery than a horrific film full of cheap tricks.\n\nThe score is beautiful and is reminiscent of the atmosphere felt in the first film. The atmosphere, although not lacking here, is different. There are a lot more calm mysterious shots than suspenseful, seat-grippers. The whole film has a slower pace and even the ending doesn't have the hectic feel that you would expect. If you're expecting to be scared, I don't recommend this but it's not a bad way to spend two hours if you don't mind something slower. ***/*****"

        "review_detailed_main": "When I entered the large theater that was showing 'The Ring Two' I didn't know what to expect. Whenever one goes and sees a sequel, they have to expect the likelihood of it being not as good as it's predecessor. For me, the original 2002 movie 'The Ring' was a creepy, deeply-disturbing, and fun thrill ride that had me going from start to finish. I could only hope this long-awaited follow-up would be half as spellbinding as the first, since the movie trailers made it look spectacular. I was dead wrong. This bloated, over-written, over-acted, suspense-lacking hunk of movie crap was a big waste of a beautiful Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe most disappointing aspect of this film has to be the lack of terror. The original provided me with one of the most frightening movie experiences I've had in my life, and this film didn't even get me to jump. Well, maybe I jumped once, but that is pretty pathetic for a self-described horror flick. The film's storyline borrows from almost every other horror movie from the past thirty-five years. Whether it's 'The Exorcist' (the little weird-looking kid gets possessed by Samura - oooohhh), or 'The Village of the Damned' (the possessed brat gets a perky R.N. to inject herself with an air-filled syringe). The direction of the film goes downhill, since the director of 'The Ring' , Gore Verbinski, decided to pass on this installment of the series (good move, Gore!). Verbinski (who is probably best known for his direction of 2003's big blockbuster 'Pirates of the Caribbean') provided immensely better camera work and scene transitions than this time-around's Hideo Nakata (the director of the original Japanese version of the 'The Ring' entitled 'Ringu', which also was a bit of a snorer). The acting is dreadful almost all the way around except for a decent and impassioned performance by the great Aussie actress Naomi Watts (who is way above a film like this). There are three interesting cameos in 'The Ring Two'; one by Elizabeth Perkins as the perky R.N., the second by Office Space's Gary Cole as a Realtor trying to sell the Morgan House Farm (instead of telling interested buyers that the Morgans both committed suicide because of their deranged little girl, he tells them they bought a condo in Phoenix, Arizona - HAH!). The third cameo of the film is perhaps the most noteworthy and regrettable -- Sissy Spacek (in a two minute role) as Samura's birth mother who tried to drown her twisted daughter after she botched a kitchen table abortion (no wonder the little girl is P.O'd.) It's not that Spacek does a bad job, she actually does a good job, it's just this film is unbelievably underneath the star of 'The Coal Miner's Daughter' and 'In the Bedroom'. Although most of it is disappointing, 'The Ring Two' has some very good qualities. The film's cinematography is excellent and they kept the same eerie music score that makes your skin crawl.\n\nAll in all, 'The Ring Two' isn't worth the price of admission. It isn't even worth a video rental. Wait until HBO and you won't regret it. Now, let's just pray they don't make 'The Ring Three'. If they do, might I suggest 'The Ring Three: The Bathtub Ring'. Grade: C- (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, Arizona, 3/19/05)"

        "review_detailed_main": "I went to see this movie with a lot of people. It was Friday and we were lucky to get tickets. I just went with two friends really, but I knew many of the people that were inside the room. \"The ring two\" generated a lot of buzz because of the success its prequel had around the world.\n\nIt started well, with a lot of images from the sea and the mountains. They didn't want us to forget about the first movie, so...They tried to achieve a way to get Samara back; so we met two persons again, watching a tape. One of them died and the other one was traumatized. Of course, this is another city, and Rachel has moved there to \"start a new life\", but sadly she's the only one who knows what happens; and sooner or later Samara will encounter her: \"I found you\".\n\nThis time around she investigates a little bit more about Samara, because now the little girl is inside of Aidan, her son; the one who seems possessed as if the movie was \"The exorcist\", and calls his mother by her name: \"Rachel\". The romantic part was occupied this time by Simon Baker, who played Max, Rachel's co-worker. He doesn't believe the story, but as the same (I'm sorry, different) character in the prequel, he will; eventually. Remember the horse in the first movie? That Rachel started to look and it became violent? Well, here we get some deers. Strange looks and violence is the result.\n\nThe performances make the movie worth to watch. I don't know if Naomi Watts should have done this, after her Oscar nomination for \"21 Grams\" and her performance in the very interesting \"I heart Huckabees\", but she didn't disappoint me at all. Her performance was strong and convincing, with all the faces and screams. David Dorfman seems to be the expert in faces, in a creepy but revealing performance. The other ones (including Simon Baker, yes) are just there to help the plot, and can't do anything about it. Although I loved to see Sissy Spacek again. I saw her a few months ago in the great \"A home at the end of the world\", and remembered that sometimes I forget what an excellent actress she is. The director also did a very good work, because the movie was scary enough, and he put a lot of style into it; the same didn't happen with the script.\n\n\"The ring\" was a good movie, and a scary one. \"The ring two\" could have achieved the same objectives (or at least the first of them), but it had to be different. It wasn't."

I've seen the original Japanese trilogy, and I really don't think the first two were good at all (\"Ringu 0\" was a pleasant surprise, but doesn't come close to \"The Ring\"). The original installment in the American trilogy (hopefully) is one of my favorite movies. How many horror movies creep you out with symbolism? \"The Ring Two\" can't hold a candle to it, I'll admit that now. But, there's a bit more delving into Samara's past, which I hope will be brought to light in a third film. I'm keeping the \"Scream\" trilogy in mind--when I saw \"Scream 2,\" I thought it was awful. \"Scream 3\" brought everything together so well that I can enjoy \"2\" now. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that they can do the same. I agree with Sean that David Dorfman was better in the first, but he had kind of a hammy part. Naomi Watts, on the other hand, seems to have matured as an actor. She was terrific in the first, but I thought her performance in \"2\" was more refined. To see, or not to see? Depends on how much you liked \"The Ring.\" The first 5 minutes or so are pretty bad. The rest of the first half is decent. The second half of the film is actually very good; it just doesn't answer any of the questions left unanswered at the end of the first, and raises a few more. Here's a toast to \"The Ring Three.\""

Set in Astoria, Oregon it not only is a wonderfully spooky tale, but the backdrop of the Pacific northwest is perfect.

It has same atmosphere and 'feel' as the 1st movie so that if watching both in sequence there is no discontinuity.\n\nThere are less novel ideas but that is understandable in a 'sequel'. Photography is still used but such as the fly in video and warped faces seen in the ring are played down. This in my opinion is a good thing. Don't flog the horse.\n\nSimon Baker is a welcome addition and plays a nice part in the story.\n\nIf you liked the Ring. Then watch this.

And it's not even confusing in a good way like Lost Highway or Mulholland Drive (also starring the lurvly Naomi Watts). The Ring was a passable thriller that had about as much logic as my review title. None! Still, Gore Verbinski took as much advantage as he could out of that logic-free world where you can't rely on the laws of nature and physics to protect you and delivered a few iconic images and some good scares.\n\nThe Ring 2 exploits and manipulates that world and gives us loads of utterly senseless plot developments that barely connect. You won't be as scared as you will be annoyed at the increasing stupidness of the film and it's sheer reluctance to make sense. Characters are not as important as confusion. Like David Lynch himself once said 'An audience would rather be confused than bored'. I mean what purpose did the character of Max serve? None! He might as well have not been in the film at all.\n\nAlso, the 'circle' imagery hardly makes an appearance in the film at all and we are left with not too subtle 'crescent-moon' images. However unsubtle the thin substance of The Ring 2 it will go completely unnoticed among the hundreds of 13-year-olds in the audience. Seriously, this is the kind of film that you go see early in the morning if you want quiet.\n\nStill, no matter how disappointed I was with this film, it's still miles ahead of the appalling Grudge (Japanese AND American).\n\nIt's also worth noting that this has nothing to do with the Japanese sequel or K\u00f4ji Suzuki's literal sequel."

Sure, the ring one was definitely more original but this one is scarier and in my eyes more entertaining. Something else that i liked is that we saw more of Samara and i really liked the character of Evelyn, Samara's mother. Probably one of the greatest things about this movie was the aura and the overall feeling of the movie. It was so eerie and creepy. I don't know what's not to like in this movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "Naomi Watts returns as single mother Rachel Keller, six months after the events of \"The Ring\", and she and her son Aidan have just moved from Seattle to Astoria, Oregon, trying to start a new life after their horrible encounter with the young, cranky spirit of the murdered Samara. But all is not well, and a dead teen is found in Rachel's new town, lying in front of his television, wildly deformed. After examining his body, Rachel suspects Samara's involvement, and quickly speaks with the young boy's friend who was present at the time of death. And, much to her horror, she learns she was right, and Samara was indeed involved. This is an enjoyable film, yet sadly it does not live up to it's predecessor. The horror of the first film is mostly missing from this one (yet we start seeing the horror again towards the second half), and at first seems like a carbon copy of the original.\n\nBut, this is quickly shown not to be the case, as the plot for the second is very different from \"The Ring\", which involves little Aidan being possessed by Samara, Aidan being taken away from Rachel, and explores Samara's early past, plus the very scary idea that Rachel may have to drown her own son.\n\nThis film was directed by Hideo Nakata, who also directed \"Ringu\", the Japanese version of \"The Ring\". While he is responsible for \"The Ring\" ever being created, one can't help wondering if a film directed by Gore Verbinksi, the director of \"The Ring\", would have been better. But heck, it's better then most sequels. The CGI in the film is very realistic (truthfully I didn't realize parts of it were CGI until watching the special features), yet thankfully did not fall into the trap oh so many films fall into, where directors get lazy and make everything CGI, which looks fine at the time, but a year down the track you'll easily be able to pick it out (pay attention George, be careful with Indiana Jones IV!).\n\nSo, while it doesn't hold the terrifying atmosphere of the original, it's still a good film. The plot is very interesting, the characters all believable and does have it's very own moments of horror. The third film is being awaited with great anticipation. Let's hope it improves on this one's mistakes!"

Throughout the movie the stunted character of Aidan failed to impress; what did impress was the sex appeal of Naomi Watts and her character. If it wasn't for her acting as the over zealous and protective mother that she was, the story would have fallen flat long before its predictable story-line did.

The cinematography, score and special effects are top notch and the odd use of jerky motion by the ghost Tamara in the film add to the creepiness. The film is a gray toned film from start to finish which creates a dark foreboding atmosphere. I especially like the score for one very simple reason. It is a real orchestral piece without the usual tricks of screaming violins or corny three note horror harmonies to give away the suspense. The film takes itself seriously throughout and I think gives the element of credibility to the story. I was a bit surprised and disappointed at the anti-climatic ending however, and felt that a scarier ending probably would have made more sense. This movie and its predecessor are the first time in a long time I have actually watched a horror thriller where I genuinely was left a bit spooked out after watching it. If any movie can do that to me, I give it hearty credit."

A heart, a heart that makes you want to watch it more. I consider it a guilty pleasure because one some parts that make you want to laugh and it's cheesy.

From the first scene, which looks and plays like your generic teen horror slasher movie, you know that the sequel will not live up to its predecessor. Where the first ring captivated audiences with suspense, originality and a rich story line, this sequel struggles to maintain any kind of coherent plot and resorts to startle and gross out tactics that can bee seen a mile a way. Ring two doesn't try to have any story depth, throwing in references and symbols that had meaning in the first ring but are completely irrelevant in the second. The wonderful eerie suspense that was created in the first film is completely gone and what is left is a carelessly made movie that was written to do nothing but capitalize on the much deserved success of the first ring. ring ring ring, \"The Ring Two will flop in seven days\"."

Besides that being just a wee bit eerie to begin with, Samara is also a killer, so Rachel has to figure out a way to get rid of her. This story is not as compelling as the first, but Samara still makes my skin crawl. This was a serviceable sequel, and they couldn't very well do the seven days bit again because Rachel already found out how to combat that. As far as scary movies go, \"The Ring 2\" was better than most."

With this film they just went for obvious and easy scares, people jumping out from nowhere and sudden reflections of evil etc.... I was bored whithin about 15 minutes of the film starting. The only good point of this film was the performance given by David Dorfman who plays the young boy Aidan. His delivery and reactions were excellent, I just hope he makes some better choices in future."

Of course my entertainment joiner friends (according to them watching movie should give a pleasure like an orgasm or stg. like that) murmurs doesn't count :)\n\nThe very-first saying about the horror feast have to be this -->\"If you haven't seen the Ring:The First, you better give your popcorn to a shinny baldy pal which will suffer lots of curses which is wholly reasonable in a silent horror movie\"\n\nThe movie begins with Aidan and Rachel's moving to a small town. From the very beginning of the movie the tension of horror voltage is high which is fixated by Aidan's moves, looks, attitudes to his Rachel (not mommy!). Then The terror of Samara comes to town in a hurried way, This coming also gives some extra voltage to the movie. So on...\n\nWhen we looked the movie like a flying-bird's distance; the first part put horror in you, the second part tells what that horror in you means, viz the second part is story-telling part. I think this technique of horror must see some respect. 'Cause it really works. You fear first, wait in a nervous, jumpy, and anxious position to solve, when you approach to the reason of whole you freak out, at last the movie ends in a calm way, and the cast comes.\n\nDavid Dorfman (Aidan) is deserves some applause, his performance hit the top. On the other side Naomi Campell (Rachel) whom i closely oversee and trying to be fan is hit the bottom. Naomi, what is my sin to see you like that, what did i do wrong. Whatever...\n\nThe movie is good, the first is better but this explains some unexplained things. And last to say; is there any alternative to go for feeling some horror. Where is the old Elm streets man... If you want to see some, go and see. I gave 7/10 (the first Ring 8/10)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Well it had to happen at some point, a film version of a Japanese horror movie that doesn't make me want to see the original version. Though I will probably still get it if it becomes available hoping its plot is a bit better than this movie's plot. Starts out promisingly enough, but about 15 minutes into it, it slows down a lot and it gets rather boring in areas. One of its problems is that it is to long. A long movie is great if it is an epic adventure or a horror of the Exorcist persuasion, but this movie just seemed to need a little more cut down. There is also way to much of the little boy from the first one in this one. He is the focal point here, and it gets rather tiresome here having to sit through his and his mother's conversations together. I don't want to give to much of the plot away, but it really doesn't seem to make a lot of sense considering the first movie where the girl is some sort of killing machine. This is where the original Japanese version of Ringu helps as it explains why the girl has the power to kill as she inherited power from her mother apparently. Here we don't know why she kills and we don't really know why she is tormenting the little boy, except that she wants a figure in her life that she has never had, but why does she want that in the first place? The evil video tape is all but gone from the plot in the first few minutes, which is a shame because that was the most interesting aspect of the first one. That movie also built up to a rather creepy conclusion, while this one's conclusion is not really all that scary at all. So if you saw the first one, you may want to check it out, if not you aren't missing a lot. I suggest if they make another one, dump Watts and the kid and move on to another person to focus the story on."

I was there the opening day to see the movie and I had high expectations . . . that were not even closely met.\n\nThe biggest problem with The Ring Two is that they took out the creepiest thing about the first movie which was the video tape. They also took out Samara Morgan flashbacks of childhood which was also very creepy in the first movie. Replacing these elements with the grown up Samara trying to possess Aidan??? This child is not that important or great that she needs to go through him to get to our world, and I was very disappointed that this was the premise of the movie. I'm not sure precisely what the premise should have been but they could have come up with something else. They didn't have to follow the premise of the second Japanese movie which if i'm not mistaken wasn't as popular as the original over their either.\n\nSticking with he video premise they could have done plenty of creative things that would have made original enough to stand on its own. There were a few good scares like Somara skittering up the walls and stuff that made you cringe but for the most part I wasn't really scared much during the movie. I definitely didn't want this to be the review that I wrote for this movie but It is unfortunately."

Are we following? Hideo Nakata, who helmed all three of the Ring films in Japan, has been brought aboard here. This is an impressive show of fealty to the source material not normally seen in studio production, and it utterly fails to pay off. This is my fourth Nakata film, and a pattern has emerged: the man clearly believes that there is something primally terrifying about water seepage. Film after film, scene after scene, we are shown water seeping through ceilings, down walls, under doors...and all I could think was, \"Man, that's going to play hell on those hardwood floors.\" To be fair, the screenplay doesn't do Nakata any favors. In going further back into the origins of Samara, and adding another unnecessary layer of supernatural gobbledygook, it resembles nothing so much as the \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" sequels. There are also several echoes of \"The Omen\", a much better evil child film than this one. First, there is a random animal attack that comes out of nowhere and is never explained or justified. There's also the use of photography to illustrate the threat. Finally, there's the protagonist being faced with a morally repugnant solution to the problem. Unfortunately, she accepts it far too quickly and blindly to make it believable, particularly since it comes from a lunatic, and the story winds up lacking the spine to follow through on this premise anyway.\n\nNaomi Watts does her best to make this work, despite having to deliver half her dialogue in a forced whisper. The child actor playing her son, who I thought was quite good in the first film, drops the ball here. It might have helped him if his few lines of dialogue weren't so fraught with portent that they read like a neon sign flashing \"Foreshadowing Alert\".\n\nThere is really only one bit of creepy imagery near the end, and it is attached to a sequence that makes no sense whatsoever. Nakata obviously has a gift for staging and visual composition that lend some atmosphere to his work. However, one has to wonder if a director with a complete grasp of English might have recognized the weaknesses in the script, and done better work with actors.\n\nIn the end, it's hard to think of this as a missed opportunity, since it was an entirely unnecessary follow-up anyway, and since the Japanese sequel really wasn't any better. It's still disappointing to see so much potential go completely to waste."

I think today, people are criticising movies to easily, but i believe there is little to pick at in The Ring Two.

Of course, trying to explain that concept to a Hollywood executive, you'd get a hearty laugh and/or an expression of bewilderment on their face, followed by some energetic grunts, of which the only intelligible word you can make out is \"money\". I don't know if this is necessarily a bad film. Me and Asian horror, well, we're no longer on speaking terms, and not only because I don't understand a word of the languages. I am not criticizing the type, or anyone who is into them. Maybe the first in this Americanized series of the (in)famous movies was made Western-friendly, and that's part of why I liked it infinitely better. But darn it, it was amazing! It had incredible mood and atmosphere, built up masterfully... while this one goes for that as well(and kudos to them for sticking with that, absolutely the right choice), I'm sorry, the threat was just not that present, much of the time. The sense of urgency is gone. Shocks are still obtained with no blood or gore, however, this one has several areas where it tries too hard to terrify the audience, and it simply falls terribly flat(and I think they went with a couple of lame and cheap scares this time, think \"cat leaps out of dark space at the characters\" kind of thing). This has nice, creepy bits. There are things similar to the earlier entry that were powerful and effective that time around, that really don't work, here. The focus is also considerably less sharp here. A thing or two are written out completely, one with such an insulting and silly explanation that you have to wonder why they left it in there. After this was over, I honestly didn't feel like it went anywhere, certainly nowhere interesting. Answers provided lead to confusion and new questions. This takes so enormously different an approach, I don't entirely understand why they used that title. The effects tend to be great. When they're bad, they are so obvious that it may take you out of the moment(can it be widely agreed that the only way CGI should ever be used for anything living, existing and recognizable, there should be motion-capture or something involved?). The acting is all solid, the kid and Watts continue to deliver. This isn't necessarily poor, and there are quite possibly people who love this. I have no beef, or any other kind of food, meat product or otherwise, with them. What I will say is that if you liked Kelly's take on this, you may not care for this. There is no sexuality, one f-word and no actual violence. The DVD holds ten minutes of deleted/alternate scenes, a handful or so of brief featurettes, and a prologue short that is, in my opinion, far superior to this. All of it is well-done and worth the time. I recommend this to fans of those who made it, perhaps especially the director. 6/10"

I mean, what's the fun in scaring the crap out of yourself and making it so you have nightmares? Beats me man. Well, I was trying to find a way to occupy myself one evening, and I still had one of my AMA movie tickets left, so I went to the theater and bought a ticket for the only movie that was showing at the exact moment I walked in the door. It was either that or wait another hour for a decent movie. So I went to see The Ring Two.\n\nApparently horror movies don't have to have a plot that makes sense.\n\nI'm sure this movie would have made more sense if I had seen the first one, but I hadn't. I might have to watch the first one now so that the second one makes a little bit more sense, but we'll see. If it's as lackluster as the second one, then I see no reason to give it a view.\n\nSo I guess that Rachel (Watts) and her son were involved in the events from the first Ring, with the stupid tape and all that crap. They moved away to try to start a new life, but that little girl from the video is after them again. More specifically, after her son Aiden. So you get all kinds of weird things happening like Aiden getting sucked into the T.V. by this crazy little girl who got drowned in a well or something like that. I don't know. The plot was so stupid that it was hard to try to keep a straight face as it was going through. I mean, good gravy people. This was just pathetic.\n\nAs far as scariness goes, I didn't really find this movie all that terrifying. There were a few creepy visuals, and a couple moments that catch you by surprise and make you jump a bit. Maybe even a few scenes where you get a bit of a chill running down your spine. But really, nothing especially noteworthy.\n\nIf I'm going to watch something that might have the potential to make me jump a little bit, I'll stick to Shyamalan's movies. They at least have a little bit more plot, intelligence, and depth behind them.\n\nBottom Line: 2.5 out of 4 (maybe if you liked the first one)"

I thought these three films (I haven't seen Ringu 0 yet) were both sh*t scary and really good thriller stories. The Ring Two is half sh*t scary, in that its all sh*t.\n\nNow i was semi-traumatised by the earlier films and was expecting the same again, especially with the increased amount of Samara. However her appearances are so predictable and fundamentally boring that it grows thin quickly. There is an awful large amount of largely awful CGI. CGI has been well used but it is close to pointless in horror, especially when it looks cheap. The much lauded deer scene is painful to watch for the crudeness of the models. CGI Samara is not very scary. The brilliant strained string music of the others is rarely present.\n\nThe first American ring was very successful in creating a well paced mystery, the video provided signposts and added well to the sense of dread. In this there is a paltry attempt to do the same again with generic 'visions'. These come too late to give any semblance of structure to a mess of a film.\n\nThis has pretty much lead me to conclude that Hideo Nataka is a one trick pony. All credit to the man, Ringu, Ringu 2 and Dark Water are all very scary but its the same thing over and OVER and OVER again. Water and dark hair is SOO last year.\n\nAll things being said there were a few good moments. Specifically the well scene at the end, which is stolen directly from Ringu 2 for those who haven't seen it, even this is ruined by the awful one-liner after they escape. 'I'm not your f*cking mommy!' I mean really, this presumably wasn't supposed to be a comedy horror, was it? I definitely felt is was watching a Ring spoof a couple of times.\n\nI was massively disappointed with this film. Frankly if you want to be scared watch the originals again, or the Eye, or even Bogeyman had some genuinely spooky bits."

        "review_detailed_main": "Original Ring director Hideo Nakata takes it back to the small scale and understated jumpy-not-bloody roots of the Japanese Originals which were shown on television in the week of Ring Two USA's UK release.\n\nThe kid turns in another great performance, carrying the film and not as showy as Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense although without the great twisting lines of the first American Ring, and really it just winds and winds up to the wisecracking end although some sentimentality is allowed to creep in with the dead. It's brought to a logical conclusion at the end although and frankly with some scenes reminiscent of the original there shouldn't have to be a third American film unless Dreamworks are desperate for money.\n\nComplaints? Some may dislike the fact that it's slower, almost stagey, compared to Gore Verbinski's original which fully embraces traditionally faster Hollywood storytelling. It's all right, just don't go in there expecting either the original or Scream and it'll be all right. Otherwise, catch the Japanese originals and rent this. Plus on the print I watched there were pops on the soundtrack which made it hard to get into the film but that's just the crappy theatre I was in. Reasonable, although maybe it should have pushed up the ante with less inventive (yet more entertaining) deaths if there might not be another one."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rachel (Naomi Watts) and her son Aiden (David Dorfman) are attempting to build a new life for themselves in a quiet town when another copy of Samara's creepy video cassette crops up. Rachel locates and destroys the tape, but in doing so sets Samara free, enabling her to possess Aiden.\n\nAs much as I enjoyed The Ring (the US remake), a videotape has always seemed to me to be a very convoluted way for a malevolent spirit to keep her curse alive (I imagine Samara sat in front of a supernatural editing suite carefully piecing together her creepy masterpiece, getting just the right amount of graininess and flickering. It's all so silly).\n\nThe Ring Two has it's scary moments (Samara chasing Rachel up the wall of a well is a particularly well executed moment) but pushes credibility to breaking point, the story making not a lick of sense. The question I kept asking as I watched the film was 'Why?': Why does Samara have this fixation with Aiden? Why do stags suddenly attack Rachel and Aiden's car? Why does Aiden's bath-water float up to the ceiling? Why can't Samara hear Aiden and Rachel when they are asleep? And why did they give the green light for this sequel with such a logic-free script?"

        "review_detailed_main": "1 - The real horror of that movie is the horror of not having a plumber; as the whole sequence of the bathroom makes a great ad about needing one!\n\n2 - It's nice indeed, but if it was produced in the 1950s!\n\n3 - Thank God that the original Japanese director didn't direct the first American version!\n\n4 - One of my friends told me that (The Ring - 2) is the most beautiful movie he has ever seen in his life. Anyway, he looked so good the last time I visited him at the insane asylum!\n\n5 - It's the same old ring however with 3/4 of it as empty!\n\n6 - When will we have (The Son Of Samara), (Samara vs. Saw), (Samara Begins) and (Samara Takes Hollywood)?! Well it's very soon indeed!\n\n7 - I heard once that one doctor wrote this movie in some prescription for a sick man as a successful cure for insomnia. I couldn't believe that until I watched it!\n\n8 - What is the scariest moment in this movie?! Of course when I remembered how much I paid to watch it!\n\n9 - If only there is some kind of legislation to sue the production companies, so we could retrieve our money whenever the movie wouldn't make our day!\n\n10 - He told me that the love scene was great, the chase sequence in the woods was spectacular, but nothing like the scene in which Samara said to (Naomi Watts): \"I'm Your Father!\".. Sorry, they were the very words of my poor friend again!\n\n11 - I remember someone was setting behind me at the theater while watching this, and whenever (Watts) was having a critical moment, he just pray to God to see her loses and be killed. So I asked him why? And he replayed logically: \"So we can all go home soon instead of watching THIS!\". To tell you the truth, me as all my friends beside me, joined him in praying afterwards!\n\n12 - It's not one of the worst sequels, or one of the worst sequels of a remake (don't start this headache please!), or even one of the worst horror movies, No.. it's all of that together and more: One of the best comedies ever made!\n\n13 - Samara's victims this time made longer list as it had: the drama, the persuasion, our patience, our money..\n\n14 - Actually this is my favorite comic note about (The Ring 2) and you can read it on the main page of it: This is a Horror / Thriller / Mystery movie.. HAHAHAA.. OH my God, it doesn't come funnier than that!!\n\n15 - Yes, they're all so silly remarks, but not as silly as this movie!"

I think \"Ring Two\" answers a lot of the questions that \"The Ring\" asked and it dose tie up all the loose ends. DO NOT SEE THIS FILM WITHOUT SEEING \"THE RING\" FIRST.\n\nLast but not least this film is a \"Horror film\" which is different from a \"Teen Slasher\" in the sense that it's actually scary, and has a bit of depth. If you like \"slasher\" films then you might find this a bit dull. There's no blood or pathetic killers in cheaply made hallo ween costumes running around with knives that are obviously plastic. If you have a brain and you know how to use it you might actually like this film."

I liked how 'The Ring' seemed very gray throughout, but the color seemed unfortunately brighter in the sequel. All of this being said, it's still better than a lot of crap that's been made in the last few years, hence my 5 out of 10 and not worse. See it if you want, but I'd wait until DVD/video...I know I should have watched more opening-round March Madness instead."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rache land Aiden move away from Seattle to start a new life after the horrible events from \"The Ring\". No more Samara, no more video tape, no more ring. But Samara doesn't give up that easily and the video tape finds its way to the new town, with Samara not far behind.\n\nI do not have the time to write a full review right now, but I will say the acting is good as usual (Naomi Watts can do no wrong, she's almost the blonde Jennifer Connelly). The guest appearance by Sissy Spacek as a mental ward patient was an excellent nod to older horror (such as \"Carrie\", another young girl with powers). And even appearing in a very limited role is Mary Elizabeth Winstead as \"Young Evelyn\"... Winstead being the actress I dub the new face of teen horror.\n\nThe biggest problem with this film is the special effects. While the first one was really creepy (and I personally think the American \"Ring\" was creepier than \"Ringu\") with the girl coming out of the television, the effects here seem like they should be scary, but aren't. The girl in the television sequences are toned down (which is like denying the best part of the first one) and other scenes like the bathtub flooding scene are interesting but not terrifying.\n\nThe actor who played Aiden is just wrong. I hate to criticize someone for their looks, but this kid is just really goony looking and I couldn't take him seriously. Any time something was supposed to be scary, he made it just look dumb. There's a fine line between creepy little boys (\"The Omen\") and boys with mental retardation (\"Ring Two\"). Also ,the writer felt the need to have Rachel say \"Aiden\" and Aiden say \"Rachel\" as much as possible. Maybe it's just me, but I don't need to say a person's name in every sentence I address to them. (There's a good reason in the plot why they stressed this, but we don't all have attention deficit disorder and need to be reminded twelve thousand times.) I liked how the mythology was built on by returning to the horse stables (or however you wish to explain the house by the lighthouse). And by explaining more about Samara's mother. This was very well thought out, and I'm glad they did it. Although, in my opinion, after Samara was defeated in \"The Ring\", she should have just stayed dead and we could have closed the case on that one...\n\nI'm sure someone else by now told you this was an awful film. I'll be the next person to tell you the same thing. It has some good scenes and Naomi Watts is wonderful, but something doesn't really add up in this one. And I also felt like I had to sit through this for an eternity even though it's only an hour and 37 minutes. That's not a good feeling. If you can't resist, rent this one... otherwise just save your curiosity for something else."

The storyline was easier to follow mostly because the main plot was told during the first one. Actor David Dorfman (Aiden Keller) puts on an excellent performance with superb talent and an outstanding acting ability to be such a young actor. Naomi Watts (Rachel Keller) doesn't do too shabby herself and her acting ability still stands firm...although she was much better in the original film and her other films as well, such as Mulholland Drive, directed by David Lynch. Sissy Spacek (Evelyn) does an excellent job even with minimal lines as she does so well with her roles in all of her films. You will more than likely jump a little here and there while watching this film!\n\nThe Bad: This sequel was in many ways like many horror sequels, repetitive. Also, the very minor roles, such as the young couple at the beginning, very poor acting abilities and a few lines seemed to be inappropriate here and there (possibly just poor errors with the writer and script editors). Some of the plot, like the first film, makes you sit in deep suspense wondering if they are ever going to get to the point. The story of The Ring should end with this sequel and not be to shame with another film...we have been scared, so please don't overdo it!\n\nThe Ugly: Samara is scary, freaky, and definitely one UGLY looking little girl!"

        "review_detailed_main": "(Words have been compromised to pass the spelling censor.)\n\nIn Hebrew and Arabic the word for ring, well (which is onomatopoeic), eye, and nothingness is the same, spelled Aleph Yod Nun, and pronounced eye, as the word eye plus inn. It is secretly known as the \"Lost Word\", the Word of Creation. Every letter in Hebrew and Arabic is also a number so that Ain adds up to 61. Notice in the movie that the apartment number was 601, the zero in the middle representing the Ring and all its analogues.     Kabalistic rabbis and Sufi have claimed that there was a verse before \"Berashith\", in the beginning, that was deleted by the Nicene Council of 325 to keep the Lost Word from the \"profane\", us. It goes, \"Nothingness was not before God spoke the word of nothingness.\" Here again nothingness and not are spelled Aleph Yod Nun. Here is what happens. When the Lost Word is spoken or even thought, somewhere in our infinitely dimensioned Hilbert Space a new world bursts into existence. The infinitesimal point nothingness is called Ain, which is \"rastered\" in time by Murphy's Law, \"If anything can happen it will\", called \"Phronaesis\" (comprehension) by the Greek Gnostics. This time space, called Ain Suph Aur, exerts its oneness in one direction which stirs closed circuitry, that there be something to move out of the way and fill in behind in the one substance, E = Mc\u00b2, energy. All these circuits are flowing the same way, counterclockwise (by convention) therefore they clash. This is a \"big bang\" called Ain Suph Aur. Now picture some coins, that heads are counterclockwise, and tails are clockwise. They can flow con fluently, the easiest way, heads on tails, heads on tails,..., in a cylindrical stack of coins, like a tornado. In this way each of the constituent circuits can lose its individuality, become nonexistent, nothingness. All forms resonate a sound, and hollow cylinders like wells make the sound eye, the Lost Word. The more con fluency there is the more it allows con fluency. It's a \"positive feedback\" mechanism. The Taoists have noticed that counterclockwise is male, and, clockwise is female. These are the true opposite polarities here. With the positive feedback mechanism here there is an increase in polarity cancellation rate, PCR, which is called entropy production rate, EPR, in thermodynamics which is an analogue of current in electricity and velocity in mechanics, therefore, it also has relativistic effects. In mechanics, nothing can surpass the speed of light. The electrical analogue however was used to accomplish the time space travel in the Philadelphia Experiment and the time travel experiments at Montauk. Our thermodynamic analogue can be used by anyone. Many years ago there was a show called \"Time Tunnel\", it was a well into the past and future, but, Dr. Hugh Everett's probability time lines, PTL's, were censored out. For every probability there is a time line. We are shown to have \"duplicates\" on these PTL's but they are actually a part of us, and that's how we dream and can have \"deja v\", to begin with. We are just not aware of these bodies. Murphy's Law demands that everything possible exists, and, in EPR's with greater than light speed analogues these are all accessible. This is proved in the article on \"multiverses\" in Scientific American's May 2003 issue.     The Nicene Coucil of 325 also deleted, from the Christian Bible, the story of Zerubbabel the King, Jeshua the High Priest, and Ezra the Scribe who visited the ruins of King Solomon's Temple, and there discovered the lost word in a well. They should have. That's the sound hollow cylinders make. Forms produce sounds, and, the tree dimensional telescope proves that sounds produce forms. By meditating upon this sound you will experience a moment of nonexistence, which the Hindus and Buddhists call Nirvana. \"The Ring\" was originally a Japanese movie, and, every solidly established tradition in the world knows these things. Are THEY trying to keep you in the dark? No! THEY are trying to keep you in blinding chaotic white light. The Lost Word brings you to a peaceful darkness from which you emerge with greater and greater wisdom and power. The resultant globally bent time space, which alchemists called a \"quickened astral light\" gives your mind the power to materialize your visualizations, more and more power. This too happens with opposite polarities allowed to cancel faster in a good conductive electrolyte, which was called a \"shekinah\" by the ancients. Association, quantum entanglement, with this gives you automatic mind power. But, can you control every thought? The name Samara means a guardian in Hebrew, but in Japanese it means Sa (apple), ma (horse), Ra (happy), Happy Apple Horse.    Since I first saw \"The Ring\" it has been my favorite movie. Among other things, I am kinesthetic, which is not considered a disease. In fact, many of the greatest geniuses like Leonardo Da Vinci, Sir Francis Bacon, Ben Franklin and Gheorghe Rakoczy were sunsets. Synesthesia is the mixing of the senses. The Ring tastes like licorice to me."

The child acting in this film is terrible, the CG was terrible, the script was I would go as far as to say , evil. the two lead roles were good, but this film is beyond salvageable.\n\nI have to admit I am pretty disgusted that Hollywood are adapting so many Asian films. Are there no fresh ideas in Hollyood? the list of horror remakes, not only of the Asian variety, certainly would lead one to think so.\n\nIf you are after a scare or two, seek out the directors DARK WATER (not the Hollywood remake) or SHUTTER (thai film) or even the EYE.\n\navoid this at all costs."

I'll say the first 30 minutes was interesting, but after that, too predictable. This movie should not have been made in the first place. I've seen scary movies before, this was almost like a comedy that isn't funny anymore. Seeing it for the first time, I already knew what was going to happen."

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw this last night and I still don't know what to think. The Ring 2 (or twO I guess) was in no way scary or creepy. I mean, it was supposed to be a horror movie right? I don't know where the filmmakers were going for whenever Samara popped up..... were we supposed to jump out of our seats and yelp? I have already seen her in the original; I know what she looks like. We also know that people's faces are disfigured when Samara kills them, it was creepy in the first but I again have already been there done that.\n\nBut I am happy to report that I was glad to see this film not go down that all too familiar path of the unoriginal rehash most horror sequels tend to take. This movie has almost nothing to do with the killer videotape but takes on an all-new original plot centering on Samara and Aidan. Finally filmmakers who want to create something new and fresh.\n\nThe Ring 2 is a drama/suspense, and in no way should be even called a horror movie. Not even the pop-up scares did anything to me because they were always the same damn thing, the same character popping up to freak out our protagonist. But there were some good shots, I especially like the shot in the beginning, showing us what Samara sees when she is doing her TV thing.\n\nThe acting was right on with Naomi Watts as she carried this film. If she hadn't returned I strongly feel we wouldn't have the same movie. She played her part just like the original and delivered one of the best lines I have heard in recent memory. David Dorfman was also exceptional on how he traded off as Aidan and Samara. Simon Baker who played Max didn't really impress me that much, he was in a more gun-ho type of character, but didn't really run with it. And I hear is leading Land of the Dead? We might have some trouble. Oh and whoever cast Sissy Spacek should receive a reward, she was brilliant.\n\nWhen I started to write this review, I really didn't know what to think of this sequel. As I continued to write it became clear to me that the filmmakers wanted to make a whole different movie and they should be congratulated. For it is not everyday we see a good horror become a good drama."

THE RING TWO shows the ghost girl in the very first scene \u2013 and if you remember you don't see her in the original Japanese film until the end \u2013 giving you some idea of just how diluted and over-obvious this movie is. A Hollywood film in the very worst sense.\n\nInstead of remaking the Japanese RING 2, this one goes in a completely different \u2013 and soul-crushingly pointless \u2013 direction. We're introduced to Samara's mother, played by Sissy Spacek, in one entirely superfluous scene. Gary Cole pops up as a slimy realtor's. A kid gets possessed and Samara keeps on popping up in mirrors, bathtubs, you name it. Never for a moment is this film scary or indeed interesting, and as Naomi Watts flounders around in wide-eyed surprise you can't help but sympathise with her for appearing in something so yawn-inducing. Take, for instance, the attack by a herd of evil CGI deer. What powers that be could ever envisage this as something remotely spooky?"

        "review_detailed_main": "Ask nine out of ten people what they first think of upon mentioning the film 'The Ring' and chances are the first thing that comes to mind won't be a ring of some sort but in fact a videotape. Yes; if the original Japanese 'Ring' film's, and then what can now be seen as the obligatory American remake, aim was to take an inanimate and seemingly unspectacular everyday object and make it 'scary' in some way then these films succeed in creating pressure and tension wherever a videotape or television is on screen. And this is where The Ring Two comes dangerously close to destroying itself entirely, although in my opinion it does just enough to avoid doing so.\n\nThe reason for The Ring Two coming so close to being appalling lies in its use of its primary weapon and its primary source for scares. In the first of these Hollywood remakes as I'm led to believe it was in the Japanese original, you got the feeling that the film was building to that dramatic climax of that young girl coming out from the television to 'get' its prey \u0096 the unbreakable wall of the television screen was broken and what surely cannot harm you could do so. In The Ring Two that very same scene so full of horror, tension and originality occurs twice in the opening twenty minutes, the first of which is the opening scene of the whole film, crudely reminding us of why we're even watching and why this sequel was even made. Along with this, we get to see how drowned little girl Samara 'takes' her prey: the close up of the Japanese journalist's face in the original as it blurred away into static nothingness was haunting enough but in The Ring Two, a scene that borders on the comical sees Samara quite literally grab someone late on in the film and try to pull them into the television.\n\nBut The Ring Two is an exercise in suspense and it is a creepy film none-the-less. I suppose videotape is a relic, it's a forgotten piece of modernity resigned to staring out of the shop fronts of your local charity store, watching people go past in the ever increasing digital world we live in. DVDs have replaced videotapes; I haven't operated a VCR in almost half a decade and whatever videotapes I still have, have probably fallen down the back of a bookcase \u0096 lost. But this is one of the things that keeps The Ring Two on that level of creepiness; the feeling that inanimate objects can hurt you \u0096 televisions and video cassettes are luxuries designed to give to you pleasure and entertainment, not take from you, period. If a third or fourth 'Ring' film was to be made and these conventions kept, I am sure it would still retain some sort of un-canniness due to what we all know about these seemingly harmless objects.\n\nSo apart from opening up like 1995's Jumanji, is there anything else to The Ring Two besides a few jumps here and there and 'that' famous scene shot from a different perspective? Short answer is that no, there isn't. Naomi Watts is back as Rachael Keller who goes on another detective strand inspired story trying to work out how Samara is still around and what she wants this time. Thrown in with all this is some relatively weak theory revolving around motherly figures and a child's basic psychological development because of lack of. But a lot of the problems I had with The Ring Two stems from daft character logic and motivation. You know how infuriating it is when you see a horror film and people do exact things they shouldn't? Well a similar feeling creeps up on you in this film and by the end, it has stuck there only this time the events do not necessarily mean certain death.\n\nSome of these occurrences happen early on at a carnival when Keller allows her son Aiden (once again played by David Dorfman) to aimlessly wander off, getting mixed up in the sideshows and people moving around as well as other such things like nasty incidences in public restrooms. Another incidence where daft logic has prevailed to merely spawn a 'scary' scene happens when Keller places Aiden in a bath full of water, despite the knowledge that Samara may be around and then leaves the house with him in the care of a male friend. But the best one is when we discover mental patients are allowed to use scissors in their cells.\n\nI mentioned how audio-visual technology plays a large role in establishing potential scares in The Ring Two but for a film to feature so much audio-visual technology like tapes; TVs; cameras and the like and for absolutely no one to ever think of even filming some of the phenomenon's that happen is ludicrous. There is photographic evidence of Samara but it doesn't get out from the boundaries of the lead characters; a bathroom has its water attached to the ceiling but no one thinks to film it and how Rachael knew what she knew for the climax without having any reason to assume so is a little messy. But the film is a demonstration in horror; the sort of film you would've been proud to have made had it been your first and a film that probably would've scored high if entered on a formal education course. Not bad nor terrible but nowhere near great."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hideo Nakata has been famous for creating that sense of dread using well place cameras, and just generally creates a sense of unease. And throughout the movie you will get the constant, recurring chills. One of the techniques I loved in 1998's \"Ringu\" is scaring you when you least expect it. While some of the scares you begin to expect in \"Ring 2\" quite a few come by surprise. For example, in the original, the mummified corpses were a big scare, well now there is an interesting twist to that fright. And without a single scene of violence, you will leave the theater with the supreme chills.\n\nThe acting is well done, and you will be able to sense secret motives, attitudes, everything comes out clear. However, one of the major flaws of this movie is the writing. The script feels very rushed, as though the writer just threw together whatever the could in a hurried deadline, so if your expecting the same quality script and well concluded story like \"The Ring\", you might be disappointed. A lot of the things don't really make sense and in some places the story contradicts what it brought in the original \"Ring.\" So in the end a lot of the characters don't end up as well, and I really disliked the way Aidan's character was written as an adult. He rarely behaved like a kid. One more thing I'd like to note about the script is that this story has a decidedly different feel to it than the first movie. The first movie felt more like a mystery, building up suspense until a shocking end. Well in the second it doesn't really operate that way since the mystery has been solved. So naturally the scares are more recurring. So in conclusion, Nakata has done a wonderful job of creating a very scary movie but in the end the story doesn't bring the satisfying ending it did in the first."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is a ball of confusing plot twists, twists that appear to have been placed in the movie in the same order they came to mind for the screenwriter.\n\nMuch like so many bad sketch comedy routines, there are good ideas here, but the execution is so poor you wish the ideas had been given to somebody else. The main characters, Rachel and Aidan, are battling the forces of darkness again, in the form of an angry little girl who was supposed to be dead.\n\nThis film, as you likely figured out from the posters and trailer, is about that little girl again. She's not finished. The whole \"unfinished business\" idea is of course what drives most horror movie sequels, and the use of that concept here is what kills the movie. Why? Because that's all there is - she's not finished. It's not really clear why. It's not clear what you can do to make her stop, either. No strange rule is created along the way to help the main characters get their normal lives back.\n\nIn absence of that, the viewer is taken on a bewildering journey through cinematic mistakes. You're left wondering all the while what you just saw, and how it could possibly relate to what's happening next. There are a few good scenes in this film, and those are what kept me from walking out of the theater for the first time in my life. Unfortunately, the director, writers, whoever helped bring this story together, toy with the viewer by giving them these few joyous moments when you think the movie is about to turn into something interesting, and they dash those hopes through dozens of minutes of confusing, meaningless emotion, and dialog that seems like the remnants of the first film.\n\nThen there are the technical problems: Did anyone notice the well they used was completely different at the bottom from the one in the original? Did they do that to make it scarier by being smaller, or because they didn't want to rebuild the original set? Why would a house that recently had its contents put in the basement have a basement stairwell covered in cobwebs? Did the movers slide the furniture down the laundry chute? When things inevitably went wrong in the town the main characters now live in, why did the police only seem to care the first time? For that matter, why would a vehicle that appeared to have been in a series of serious collisions, having only one headlight, be allowed to cruise around town without being stopped by any police? Bear in mind these examples are being given because they won't spoil the film for you. There are pages of ones that would.\n\nIf you want to be horrified that a movie like this is being released across the country, this is the movie for you. If you want to be horrified by a well done story about fear, watch The Ring again, and stop the tape right when Rachel tells Aidan that it's over. That's the peak of this story line. Everything else is a disappointment.\n\nI saw this film at a preview screening March 15. I was so glad to have left the theater at the end, and so amused by how stupid the story was, that I started laughing as I walked to my car. I haven't ever given something a 1 rating before, on my mental scale. This movie worked very hard to get it.\n\nTo be clear, I didn't see the original Oriental version of this film. I don't know what the original story was. My judgment is based on what I saw in the American adaptation, The Ring, and this terrible sequel."

For every 1 minute of dialog or plot development, there was 15 minutes of the aforementioned pointless walking/crying/staring/etc. There was really only one part (and by \"part\", I mean \"split-second\") that made me actually jump in shock. There was nothing going on in this movie. It did a horrible job of explaining what was even happening. They decided to steal an awesome scene from \"Nightmare on Elm Street\". You know that scene with all the blood flowing around the room and on the ceiling and whatnot, except they decided to go with bathwater instead of blood, so it sucked anyways. The effects weren't even that good. It's like they just decided to use crummy effects because they knew they would need all the profits they could get out of this.\n\nTerrible movie. Don't let yourself have any part of it. Ever. Don't rent it, don't download it. Just put it out of your memory, and thank me for saving you the from the most agonizing 2 hours of your life."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Ring Two (2005) was a better film than the first one. The story wasn't all that hot but the directing by Japanese film maker Hideo Nakata pulls all of the rabbits out of his hat and uses every trick he knows to make a decent movie with sub-par materials. He some hows manages to make the kid act this time around (he was real bad in the first film). Naomi Watts pulls off a better performance this time around as well. The supporting actors were adequate as well. Too bad the director wasn't given free reins upon the project because he could have made a great film instead of a watchable one.\n\nLet's hope that in the future Hollywood would give Mr. Nakata the chance to really shine! Compared to the other hacks who should be either directing local dinner theaters and community plays, he's actually quite good. The Ring Two is a prime example of what a brilliant director can do with shoddy materials. Make an imitation silk purse out of a sow's ear.\n\nRecommended."

I had never been so pleased to actually be moved by a horror film, as I had become very jaded by the horror genre and thought there was nothing that could move me to actually being scared. I also enjoyed the Japanese originals as well. Not as scary as the remake, but I appreciated the source material. Then we come to \"The Ring Two\" and I have to say...\n\nIt was a let down. Very contrived and self absorb ant relationship between the mother and child. The sequel might have been better if they explored what had happened up to the point where the movie actually began, I'm referring to the viral nature of that VHS cassette being passed among all those teenagers. I know there had been a short down but it could have been expanded. Instead, we got this dull, plodding mess!"

I can't help but thinking they put some scenes there just to make the occurrences make sense, which they eventually do not.\n\nI must say I liked the first one better, mainly because of the stylish way of filming, which lacks in the sequel. Probably due to Nakata's Japanese, and thus very \"naked\" way of filming. So he refused to add some innovative visual approach to it. What he DID add was the regular Hollywood-trash we see in every so-called scary movie. Unexpected scares, hands, faces, all that jazz. Like I said, the abstract and floating threat from The Ring and certainly the Japanese original, is totally absent. In this sequel it's just good against evil, the ancient battle, with ancient means of portraying that. And it's boring.\n\nI tend to think the producers bent Nakata's initial idea into mainstream chewed out horror.\n\nThere was nothing, actually, that kept me glued to the canvas. I just wanted to make sure I was right about the ending.\n\nVery obsolete sequel. Might be good for the money though. I'm afraid they killed the goose now. Or jumped the shark.

Newspaper reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) and her son Aidan (David Dorfman) have moved to a small town, Astoria, Oregon, to get away from the terrifying events that happened to them in Seattle. Rachel now works for the local newspaper, The Astoria Gazette, when she hears on the police scanner that the police are investigating the mysterious death of a teenager. Rachel goes to the crime scene and discovers that Samara Morgan is back, starting a new cycle of death by taking her revenge on the people of Astoria. Aidan begins to lose body temperature, so Rachel takes him to the hospital. Hospital doctors find bruises on Aidan, and they believe Rachel has been abusing him. Rachel is barred from seeing Aidan until an investigation is completed. To stop what is happening to Aidan, Rachel goes back to the home of Samara Morgan in Seattle to find the truth. For a horror movie, it was just so-so. I did jump out of my seat a few times, but it wasn't that scary. Actually, the audience laughed at some of the scary scenes. You can wait to see this one, and the door is open for a third movie. (DreamWorks Pictures, Run time 1:51, Rated PG-13)(4/10)"

While it doesn't fall in the bowels of sequel \"suck-dom\", it definitely doesn't do the original justice. The direction by Hideo Nakato and Naomi Watt's acting definitely save it from sequel mediocrity. As for the storyline, I felt that it didn't flow evenly with the premise of the original. Although a link could be made, it is very brittle and prone to many logistical flaws, even when you get rid of the \"suspension of disbelief\" theory. The film has some intelligent moments to it, but these moments get spoiled when a character decides to explain the obvious. Overall, I would say I did enjoy the film, but I definitely wasn't overwhelmed by it."

The story needed introduction of new characters and character development. The only new main character is Max (Simon Baker) who is an editorial writer who is working with Rachel (Naomi Watts). However, the director and writers did not explain his relationship with Rachel well enough. Would a co-worker who you barely know really drop everything they are doing to help you in your problems? Probably not. Had the romantic interests between them be more developed, it would have made more sense. David Dorfman (Aiden), does a fantastic job as Aiden in this movie. His stares at Rachel sent chills up my spine many-a-times. The only real suspense of the movie occurs in the last 5 minutes. But I'll let you view that for yourself. If you loved The Ring like most people did, go see The Ring 2."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Ring 2\" has received a lot of heat from critics and audiences alike, and I think that has to do with the fact that ever since \"The Grudge\" (a terrible piece of schlock that unfairly grossed over 100 million at the US box office) there seems to be a new horror-thriller of that ilk released every other week. And they are all terrible. So here finally comes the sequel to the film that started this derivative \"Sixth Sense\" meets Japanese horror blend of schlocky US movie trend (\"The Grudge\" standing tall as the most successful of them, second only to the movie it ripped off--the original \"Ring\"), and everyone seems to hate it.\n\nYes, without artistic hack master supreme Gore Verbinski (the best for-hire director working these days, in my honest opinion) at the helm, \"The Ring 2\" is set adrift in watery dream imagery and non-sensical hugger-muggery. Granted, the first film didn't make much sense when you thought about it, but it did have a very sustainable level of atmospheric mystery and dread ratcheted up for maximum shock value. Here, we get a more psychologically taut look into the progressive madness of a mother driven to the brink of insanity. The \"Ring 2\" ends up not being a horror movie, but a postcard visit (lost of dreadfully pretty imagery again here, though not as artistically astute as the stuff Verbinski brought us in the original) into the mind of a woman who thinks she has to kill her son to save him from the evil in the world. This ends up becoming a two-person show: Naomi Watts, picture perfect again as a mad woman, and young David Dorfman doing some nice child acting ranging from borderline Autistic to split personality. All in all, for a sequel, this wasn't too bad, and unlike most recent horror movies, it's anchored (ala Nicole Kidman in \"The Others\") by a go-for-broke performance from an accomplished actress. In the end, it unfortunately was not sunk by its own faults, but by the drudge of sewage that it inspired in other lesser films."

It's a rehashing of the first movie, and in that sense not surprising, good, or even scary. There were maybe 4 points which gave me a startling jump, but not a big one, just moments where in the silence something pops up or music sounds.\n\nTo further illustrate that it was not at all scary, the theater I was in had people LAUGHING at numerous points. I mean outright laughing, and not one or two people. Especially the Deer scene, the whole theater was laughing (maybe because in Western New York deer are nothing special). You'll see when you see the deer scene...\n\nThere's also one scene with something that's supposed to be \"scary,\" Naomi Watts screaming, and loud music...and then right at the end there are 3 sharp claps. CLAPS? I turned to the person next to me and said \"What's with the clapping? Is that supposed to be scary?\"\n\nOverall it felt like a waste, and I'd be surprised if it did well at the box office.

I liked the first film, I thought it was creepy and the ending was great. But, this movie was terrible. First of all, the sequel breaks all the rules we learned from the first film. In order for Samara to kill you, you have to watch the tape. Well, they come up with this lame story of 2 kids watching the tape and it happens to be in the same town Rachel is living in. So, some how Samara tracked her down. Well, no one after that watches the tape, yet Samara continues to take over Rachel's son, Aidan. Soon, Aidan is possessed, but the plot is really stupid.\n\nThere are silly scenes with computer generated deers attacking Rachel's car. That really wasn't scary. And floating water was the other method used that was supposed to be scary.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: Horrible, a perfect example of Hollywood greed. This should have never been made."

        "review_detailed_main": "The most suspense sequel this year makes a dramatic impact in cinemas this week as The Ring continues its frightening climax.\n\nAcclaimed director, Hideo Nakata has created a nail-biting masterpiece designed for brave cinema fans as they embark on a journey of excitement and terror.\n\nWith a fairly unknown cast the story begins as Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) and her son Aidan (David Dorfman) move to the community of Astoria, Oregon to start a new life.\n\nAs Rachel gets a job at the local newspaper office and Aidan starts at a new school, their lives seem to be getting back to normal.\n\nHowever the haunted past they left behind soon catches up with them as Rachel learns of an apparent homicide, she immediately suspects involvement with Samara and the ghostly videotape. She destroys yet another copy of the tape, but that only makes Samara angrier.\n\nNow, Rachel has to find a way to put Samara to rest once and for all, before it's too late. Will she rescue her disturbed son in time and will she find out what Samara really is? The film had a rather confusing plot that raised more questions than answers, Is Samara a demon, ghost or the devil and why is Aidan such a strange child? Although I must credit the actors for a convincing array of performances; Born in Shoreham, Naomi Watts (Mulholland Drive, 2001) played the part of Rachel with dignity and David Dorfman was also very promising as the little Aidan; I felt their acting was sheer brilliance for such difficult roles.\n\nBut my favourite actor was Simon Baker (L.A. Confidential, 1997) who played the minor part of Max Rourke; His role seemed to strengthen the rest of the small cast.\n\nAll in all, this movie is one of the best sequel's I have seen in a long time, its full of suspense, fear, excitement, anger, emotion and will most definitely make you jump out of your seat petrified. Just be warned this is horror at its most horrifying and may even be cursed!"

The second doesn't really add to it... it kinda drags... It's sorta like making a sequel to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Which would be kinda stupid.\n\nBut, the terrifying thought of something coming out of your TV is STILL scary and the thought that they are going to keep coming back.\n\nAll in all, the predictable plot kinda ruins the whole scary part, but it's worth the wait to see the ending.

        "review_detailed_main": "Title: The Ring Two (2005)\n\nDirector: Hideo Nakata\n\nCast: Naomi Watts, David Dorfman, Simon Baker\n\nReview:\n\nAfter the phenomenal success that was the first film, it was only a matter of time before a second installment would appear in theaters. This time around they decided to let Hideo Nakata the director of the original Japanese version of The Ring (Ringu) helm this sequel. Would it be worth our while to see Samara terrorizing Naomi Watts and her son one more time?\n\nWell if you remember correctly the story in the first flick revolved around a killer videotape. After you watched it you would die in seven days...unless you made a copy and passed it to someone else and that someone else actually watches it...then you are free of the curse. This time around the story doesn't focus so much on the killer video tape angle (actually I think its a smart move since VHS movies are a prehistoric creature from the dark ages) and focuses more on the little ghost girl Samara and her origins. She also has a deadly purpose with Rachel and her son.\n\nThere's a few things going against this picture right from the beginning. It has to go up against its predecessor and that right there is a tough thing to do. The first Ring film made a real impact on people...it managed to scare without relying on gore, or cheap scares. It was a movie that got into peoples heads and stayed there long after they left the movie theater. And that incredible success and impact that the first movie made is something hard to top. Case in point: this sequel didn't quite surpass the first one. It was good, but not good enough. Comparisons to the first one were going to be inevitable.\n\nOne thing that helps this movie is the fact that at least they had a strong cast headed by the great Naomi Watts who never ceases to surprise and amaze me. She is one of the greatest actresses of our time and she always manages to infuse her performances with great emotion and intensity. She does it again here, even though the script is filled with more plot holes then you can care for. David Dorfman who plays her son Aidan did a swell job, and even though people refer to his acting as wooden, I think he did a good job because his character required to be a chilly, calculating character. It was necessary for the story. Sisy Spacek pops up in a cameo as Samaras mom and does a fine job as well.\n\nThe movie has some nice moments going for it, like for example the scene in the bathtub which is really cool visually. That image of the water flowing to the ceiling of the bathroom is amazing. And kind of reminiscent of Nakatas other film Dark Water. People might also see the similarities between this movie and the American adaptation of Dark Water with Jennifer Connelly. Ghost girl looking for a mommy. So in originality points Ring Two went down a few notches.\n\nAnd just when things are going nicely...in come the deer. If you remember correctly on the first ring movie we had a scene in which a horse goes nuts and hurls himself into the ocean. On this one they were trying to duplicate the animal threat element and defy logic at the same time by having some deer go crazy. Now normally I wouldn't decline to having a crazy sequence like that come out of nowhere and make no sense at all...but these deer were CGI deer. And there's nothing worse then computer animated animals. Remember the monkeys of Jumanji or the wolves in The Day After Tomorrow? Or hows about the wolf dog in Cursed? Now you can add another to that list: The Reindeer on The Ring Two. When will directors learn not to computer animate animals? It just doesn't work! A scene that could have worked great in the film had they used real animals turns into a laugh fest and completely takes you out of the movie cause you realize that you are watching a special effect.\n\nAside from that, the movie doesn't make much sense in many places. Samara being lost? All it takes to put Samara out of action is placing a lid on the well? Didn't Rachel do that already on the first film? There's more loopholes like this one that just get completely ignored. Why would Reindeer attack Rachel and Aidan? Can the animals detect evil or are they being controlled by Samara? Anyhows, all in all this movie didn't live up to the legacy left by its predecessor. Its not a bad film, it has beautiful visuals, good performances and moments. But it was just too low key, a little too mellow and failed to muster up the intensity and feeling of dread that we got from the first one.\n\nRating: 3 out of 5"

        "review_detailed_main": "i think for people to say it was worse than the first film is a fair point but it really isn't the truth at all. the way this film carries itself is amazing due to the direction by Nakata you can actually believe this film a lot more than the first one. the ring, was such an over the top teen horror film with lack of intellect. the ring 2 displays a much more realistic psychological approach even though the entire concept is based on such a \"childish interpretation of supernatural horror\". nothing in the film is over the top or Hollywood or too scary it focuses much more on the break up in scare throughout the picture. you would see a scene where you think something is going to happen but it doesn't then it will calm down but you still have the tension lurking due to the great acting and then something will happen and the psycho's of the audience and the characters are played with a lot more and because of the psychological disturbance the film doesn't need to be over dramatised but is made more eerie and believable. even though it is predictable in some parts the journey of the film and the ending and certain parts are misleading which in turn is playing with the viewers as well the characters and leaves you feeling somewhat confused and uncertain of what you have seen. its a great film and i would recommend any one to see it. its not exactly Hollywood horror or screams, its more of a messed up psychological war of emotions and reactions and reality is played into an unreal script. well done hideo nakata, you can tell its directed by a Japanese director..."

It succeeded only in trashing the mythology of the original, which set so many standards for the new-age horror film. Why should we as fans enjoy this muck that takes a horrid u-turn in the plot and logic? Why? What the hell was Dreamworks thinking? Did Naomi except the script? Or was she forced to do this crap by the studio? This film is ludicrous. We find Rachel Keller and her son Aiden, running of to the nearest town that will probably protect them from the Seattle nightmare, but predictability catches up with the otherwise new story, and not only ruins the fun, but makes the film less novel. All this happens in the first 30 minutes or so. Next, we are taken through the most unexplainable events that writer cannot back up, and to build the stupidity even lower, the original mythology is reconstructed with the most lame explanation in the book! I will let you all find out what this is on your own, but you probably already know. The last reel is horribly laughable, with conformist dialogue and pathetic special effects that look like a play-station video-game. Please, heed the right warnings and stay away from this film, even the most dedicated of fans have been disgusted by this odious pile of illogical feces! 0/10, and I'm being generous!"

The plot was weak, I didn't care what happened in the story, I just wanted the film to end so I could leave the cinema without disturbing the people sitting near me! The way the film was shot, the colours, camera angles, even the special effects were completely different to the first film. This may have been intentional, but for 'The Ring' the way the film was directed is one of the elements that make it so good. The characters have changed in 'Ring 2' also. Naomi Watts character is no-where near as convincing, nor is Aidan's character, although having seen their brilliant performances in the first film I think this is the fault of the weak screenplay and direction as opposed to the actors in question. The first film had a complex plot which drew me in and kept me interested, it was full of powerful imagery that confused and unnerved me, and it created tension from the start, creating a mood which remained consistent to the end. This sequel had none of this and I would suggest if you enjoyed 'The Ring', then you will be disappointed if you watch 'Ring 2'. I have seen 'The Ring' several times now and thoroughly enjoy it every time - even though I know how it ends! I will never bore myself by attempting to sit through 'Ring 2' again. Very poor!!"

Maybe its my own fault, because the First \"Ring\" managed it to be in my personal All-time-favorites and so expectations were pretty high and though I tried to lower them, the presented sequel didn't even catch up with those.\n\n\"The Ring 2\" is more a drama with suspense-elements, than a real horror-flick. The mother/son story was well presented, the camera was excellent, the music with its Japanese kitsch was annoying in some parts. Where they used the original score, it worked. Hideo Nakata should have watched his Japanese Colleagues remake of \"The Grudge\". This guy knew how to scare and create a creepy atmosphere.\n\nWell: maybe if I see it again (on DVD) I will like it better, because then I know what to expect and I might see it different then. But right now, a day after the \"Ring-Experience\" I'm still disappointed and I wish I would have been patient enough to wait for the DVD-Release.\n\n6 Stars out of 10 are okay, because it was not bad and maybe, but just maybe, I will love it if I see it again."

When you know what's coming it's just not as scary. But in the Ring 2's defense it could have been a lot worse (As many sequels are). There were a few scary moments but what I found really killed the movie was how some of the scenes seemed rushed or unfinished (namely the scene in the basement where all the lights start going out).

The original Ring was part horror movie, part mystery. It was a about a mysterious tape which causes the viewer to die in 7 days, and the main character, Rachel (played by Naomi Watts) watched the tape, along with her ex (and later her kid). It worked well because the characterization of both her and her ex was quite good, the viewer liked the characters and so were concerned about them. And the mystery behind the tape was unraveled slowly but deliberately, giving the view just enough to be drawn in.\n\nThe sequel misses the mark in just about every fashion. It starts off like the original, we think, but it seems the rules have changed - a person watching the tape has to convince someone else to watch the day within 7 days or they die. But this premise is dropped almost immediately, and the story revolves around Rachel's son, Aidan, who mysteriously becomes ill with hypothermia.\n\nThe characterization in this movie is simply awful. None of the characters have any sort of personalities - they are as wooden as a Keanu Reeves puppet. There is no \"deadline\", so there is no feeling of impending doom for any of the characters. It tries to repeat the mystery aspect of the original, bur rather than slowly decoding subtle clues in the video, the mystery is solved by a simple visit to the basement of a house. The acting was pretty much lethargic, other than the very brief appearance by Garry Cole. At some times, you have to wonder who would fall asleep first, the actors or the audience...\n\nThe finale is completely predictable as well. Some bad movies are fun to laugh at (or with, in the case of campy movies). But this just is almost painful to watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "By the time the giant stags start attacking the car, it's apparent that \"The Ring Two\" has no rules. By dispensing with even the meager narrative constraint that governed the first \"Ring\" (see a tape, die in a week unless someone else sees it), \"The Ring Two\" excuses itself from any unreasonable expectations of coherence and basic cause and effect. The deer are agitated by the possession of Rachel Keller's son Aidan by the vengeful spirit Samara, the dead little girl with a very bad hair day from the first film. Also because a car surrounded by a herd of threateningly serene ungulates is a vaguely creepy sight.\n\nHaving fled the big city stresses and soul-sucking demons of Seattle with her son, Rachel (Naomi Watts) is relieved to begin a new life as a small town reporter in Astoria, WA. Evil little Samara, though, is NOT cool with that, and follows them to the boondocks, where she quickly decides that she likes Aidan enough to stay awhile in his body. How does she manage all this? She shows up one night in their TV; being a malevolent spectre does involve some neat party tricks. Other things she can do, in addition to the aforementioned steer steering, include making trees erupt in flames, causing bathwater to rain up to the ceiling (an admittedly arresting visual), and impelling people to kill themselves just by looking at them. Although this seems a far more stimulating existence than most of us lead, Samara is determined to stick around in poor Aidan's body, presenting Rachel with a dilemma: under what name should she enroll her son in prep school? Arbitrary and nonsensical imagery is a favorite horror staple, but without even the sketchiest narrative framework within which to present it, we're left with a bewildering grab-bag of grotesquerie. \"The Ring Two\" is simply a series of Scary Ghost Tricks, connected by nothing we can grasp with which to make sense of them. Sissy Spacek does a cameo turn as Samara's scissor-wielding mental patient mother, the victim of a series of psychiatric facilities with the worst patient confidentiality records ever seen. \"Listen to the voices,\" she tells Rachel, \"be a good mother.\" Call me old fashioned, but any notion of motherhood that comes from disembodied voices seems to me a bit suspect. In the third act, when Rachel literally climbs into the deadly video to do battle - the video that keeps turning up on her TV even though the last existing tape of it has been destroyed -we've been bludgeoned into just letting the film get on with its absurd business. Strangely enough, \"The Ring Two\" ends with nary a twist nor opening for a future installment. It's a shame, really; that prospect would be the scariest thing this mess could muster."

        "review_detailed_main": "What was so wrong about the original that they had to make it so different? It only had half the atmosphere of the first ring, and non of the style. The first one was smart and in a way bad-ass! This one played it safe and tried to hard to be like the grudge. The first one had such atmosphere and knew not to show too much of Samara so as not to make it look like a cheap horror instead of a smart horror/thriller. The surprise ending could have been better shown, and for some reason in this movie Samara is the same ugly brown color through the whole film, I like the whole black and white thing from the first movie.\n\nWell enough with the negative, this movie does have its positives or els I wouldn't give it a 6/10. The story line was very interesting and Niome Watts was showing most of her talent- and she has a lot of talent. David Dorfman was alright but he seamed to be better in the first one. The drama was good too,I loved how Rachel Keller was again faced with a moral and complicated dilemma. The scene in the well was very suspenseful but the whole thing about Samara moving like kayako from the grudge wasn't well played, i think the fast motion was a little too fast and made Samara look like a spider. But again a very suspenseful scene.\n\nThis is for the director of the ring 3 which is rumored to come out in 08: please watch the first ring and follow in it's example don't make this even worse than the ring 2 witch has i think 2.2 less stars than it's predecessor."

The Ring Two takes its self too seriously to ever be much fun and there aren't any big scares that don't come across as laughable like a horde of CGI deer attacking Rachel and Aiden in their car."

Therefore, this work is more typical than a-typical of American horror movies, and as such, it plays more or less like what one might expect of an American horror sequel in that it breaks its own rules, omits information given the audience in the previous installment, and thus bears less credibility than The Ring.\n\nHowever, in spite of the story variations, and other moderate problems, this sequel is still quite enjoyable. The performances contributed by David Dorfman and Naomi Watts were exemplary, and the story itself still bears a wonderful, darkling atmosphere. True, the atmosphere is not as serious or thick as the first, but it is still quite enjoyable.\n\nIf you like horror movies in general, and enjoyed the original, I would suggest a viewing, in spite of the naysayers.

Whereas Thr Ring actually had a plot to it, and it's not just the girl doing random stuff. Thank god that they aren't making a 3rd one, to destroy the already destroyed movies.\n\nIt really does make me mad that directors always do this to really good movies, I could name a whole list of movies that have been ruined because of their sequels, this is one of them.

        "review_detailed_main": "Let me start off by saying that \"The Ring\" was a fantastic and disturbing film filled with a lot of suspenseful moments and an interesting back story. That's hardly the case with \"The Ring Two.\" The beginning is basically a re-hash of the first film's beginning, with absolutely no suspense, and corny images. I actually laughed out loud at how corny some scenes were. The whole movie goes by and tries to make logic, while it completely throws out the logic of the first film, where the only way you were safe was to make a copy of the video. The deer scene looked completely fake, and didn't even make sense in the plot...even when you find deer horns in the basement. It never came together. Also, the whole second hour doesn't even TRY to scare the audience at all until the last few minutes, and even then it doesn't work. So, don't hold your breath in suspense. There's not even any false scares.\n\nMy theory is that the filmmakers rushed to write this movie after the success of the first one, just to throw it out and make more money, without taking the time to add any logic to the story. There was barely a plot. Also, Naomi Watts was in contract to do the sequel after the first one. That's the only way I see she would've made this movie after the script. At least she acts good and does her best with what she's given.\n\nI will say that the water imagery and the cinematography were outstanding, creating a creepy atmosphere. But it never went anywhere. There were a few interesting parts where I thought the movie would turn into something really good, but that never happened. BOTTOM LINE: Even if you're a fan of the original (like me), you will hate this one."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Ring Two is an inferior sequel to the brilliant original that was actually not original but an American remake of a Japanese horror film (Ringu) that practically started the j-horror sub-genre. The amusing thing is that the director of the original two Japanese Ringus directs the sequel to the American remake. Unfortunately, despite his decent but somewhat bland direction, the script fails at engaging the viewer. It's tedious and predictable where it should have been exciting and fresh. My favorite moment was the controversial wild animals attack. Some complained about their CGI roots, I thought they looked great. Nothing after that grabbed my attention as much. The lack of scares and shocks might be compensated by the stronger emphasis on mystery, mounting dread and atmosphere (usually prevalent in j-horror) but no such luck here. Naomi Watts, the lead reprising her role from the first film, is very good at conveying real emotion and delivers a fine subtle performance.\n\nThe character development arc for the son was supposed to be chilling and disturbing but it really wasn't so for me. The boy looked creepy enough from the start but I'm not sure he had the acting chops for the transition. To be fair, that was a difficult role and the script could also be blamed. They put more focus on the origin of the dark-haired girl from the first Ring than the killer videotape (a defensible choice) but beyond the novelty cameo by a famous actress, it wasn't that engrossing or surprising. The Ring Two is highly reminiscent of Dark Water (same genre and same original novel writer) in its themes and you would probably be better off renting that. Ring two is not horrible in itself, it's just so disappointing compared to the original because it feels that by trying to be different, focusing more heavily on characters than plot, they failed to capitalize on the strengths of the Ring except for Naomi Watts who would probably be great no matter what she was in.\n\nRating: 4.5 out of 10."

The first one had me so scared that I made my boyfriend stay home from work the next day so I didn't have to be alone. I even made him keep the door open when he went in the bathroom because I was so scared. I wanted this movie to be every bit as good as the first, but it pales in comparison. It is hard to believe it is even the same characters and writers. The acting was horrible as well (sorry Naomi) despite the fact they had a decent cast (including Sissy Spacek in a cameo appearance). They must have paid Naomi Watts a heap load of cash to get her to do this movie. She typically selects decent scripts and there is no way she could have read this and thought it was good.\n\nDuring the movie people were actually laughing. Laughing at the parts that were supposed to be scary. Remember how scary seeing the face of the murder victims was in the first, well in this one, the audience laughed every time.\n\nPlot wise, I was hoping to learn more about the secrets behind the Ring. Things that weren't answered in the first one-like if this all happened so long ago, than how did the movie go from 8mm to VHS and who thought of doing that? Who filmed all this stuff anyway? Why was Samara calling people on the phone right before she killed them? Where was she really from? What created her? What drove her to be evil? They introduce her mother in this one, but we still don't really know what she is or what drives her.\n\nThe first one was amazing and brilliant, but the second was just an excuse for the producers to make money off the success of the first one. All I can say is they should have called the Ring Two the Ring Boo! Hope they don't try to do a third one, they are ruining the memory of the first one."

The parents in the first film were her adopters. The more the plot grew, the more the movie intensifies the viewer. The real changes in the movie is when they replaced the horses with deer. Now that's where the differences take place in the sequel. even though horror movies have no effect on me, \"The Ring Two\" is just as scary as the first, but in my opinion, I liked the first one better in one way, the sequel in another. The first one I liked the seeing the sexy side of Naomi Watts. The second one I liked the tough side of her. With Samara taken care of in the second one, is there a possibility of a third installment of \"The Ring\"? We shall see..... Rating 4 out of 5 stars."

It left me with the feeling that most of the sequel could have been included on the original movie's DVD as deleted scenes or alternate scenes. The new director takes away a lot of the frightening power of the Samara character by showing her so frequently throughout the movie that I was used to seeing her towards the end. The original director got a lot more out of the scary scenes of the first movie, but he also had a good story to work with.\n\nI do not recommend this movie to anyone that enjoyed the first. More of the same with less execution just isn't very satisfying."

        "review_detailed_main": "I thought the first Ring movie was excellent, so I was really looking forward to the sequel. Here is a short list why this movie failed to hold a candle to the first: 1) The original Ring movie consists of well-thought out mystery \"Rachel\" attempts to unravel throughout the course of the movie. The writers of Ring II try to do the same thing, but nothing is ever discovered. She tries to find answers from the girls real mother and you keep thinking she is going to discover something, but nothing ever happens.\n\n2) The scare element in this movie is all physical and not at all genuine as in the first. Nothing compares to the scene where the little girl crawls out of the television at the conclusion of the first ring. All the scares in this movie are \"jump\" scenes.\n\n3) The only thing bigger and better in this movie are the special effects, but they are just that...effects, attempting to mask the poor script of this movie.\n\n4) Most importantly the whole concept of this movie \"the little girl wants to be the boy\" goes against all the \"rules\" made in the first one. The whole time I'm watching it I'm thinking this is just like when Oliver was added on the Brady Bunch. Thats a pretty far fetched analogy, but if you've seen the movie you get it....they writers were just reaching. Too much time was put into special effects and too little was put into the plot. The Ring II is just a ploy to con Ring I fans out of their money...it worked on me. Way too Hollywood.\n\nFinal Thought--- I do not care if you do not agree with this review....when you hit the disagree button all you are telling me is this.... A) you enjoyed meet the fockers. B) You probably did not ever receive a formal education"

There was a lot of potential but for me it just fell a little short. I think it was because the first one slowly built up to a great ending where this one just never quite got there.\n\nThis was more of a drama than horror movie.

Watt seems more comfortable in role, bringing some superb maternal instincts to her character Rachel. Dorfman also shines as Rachels son Aiden providing us with a confused and sometimes disturbing character. The Brilliance of The Ring Two is in it's quality performances, compelling plot and inventive eye candy. It is a rare, relentless Friday night thrill ride that demands the viewers intelligence."

I just hate it when studios and writers try so hard to stretch a movie past it's limits, the result could only be a bad one, and it's no different here. In the original, the tape was getting around killing people, and it so happened that the girl's mystery had to be solved; she was in effect haunting everyone who watched the tape. So be it... it was tolerable, but I was able to accept it. An okay little horror flick. With 'The Ring Two' now, it's no longer about the tape getting out and killing people. The makers needed SOMETHING to do in the sequel, so they decide to nullify all of the events of the original; essentially saying, 'oops we should've closed the well in part one; see now she's free to come after us....here's our sequel!!'. No longer bound to the tape, now the ghost girl wants a human body to occupy....sounds familiar? It quickly falls into the clich\u00e9s of movies like Gothika, The Grudge and about every other ghost movie, quickly making it just another run-of-the-mill horror movie. The plot has many too many holes in it, because they just abandon everything established in the original for the sake of saying they have a franchise. The result is simply shameful. A terrible sequel, hopefully this'll be the end of these movies; though I highly doubt it.\n\n*1/2 out of **** stars."

The Ring 2 was quite scary at a few moments and very little cheese.\n\nIt does have its cheesy points, but they're not as major as people want to think. 80% of the movie is well made, and at some points better than the original. Yes, they should have stayed with Gore instead of getting a new director. Yes, this director has no idea how to create the suspense or atmosphere, as well as got some laughable actors. BUT the story itself is still awesome.\n\nThe bit of surrealism in the end sold me. The story is still good. It's worth a rental, at least, if you liked the first movie.

What the crap? Can you not find real deer anymore? Are they extinct? If you're a fan of plot plants that actually don't lead to anything, then this film is for you. The story hardly made sense because of so much useless crap in it. Oh, and the film isn't even remotely scary except for the one or two cheap pop-out-at-you moments that rely on automatic reactions. The Ring was a decently creepy movie, but the Ring Two is nothing more than a poor attempt at raking in more money b/c of its predecessor's success.

This film seems to go with more chills and jumps than story.\n\nAnother problem with this film is that it's side characters do not get developed. You sit their not caring about any of the supporting characters. Key performances in the film were by Gary Cole who has a bit part as a real estate agent and the two young actors in the beginning of the film.\n\nThere is too much David Dorfman(Aiden)on the screen.

I cringed, and hoped for the best. It never came. The scene went on for awhile, and just made my mind feel the need to implode.\n\nThe actors all try their best with the material given, even though most of the supporting cast is on and off the screen in less than 15 minutes.\n\nAnd the Unrated footage just makes the film drag on longer than it needs to, and makes for consistent \"What went wrong?\" questions to be asked throughout.\n\nThe film's basic idea and how it is carried out is something different in itself, and makes the movie potentially watchable to teenagers and fans of the original, but the film is more or less, a could-have-been, but never-was.\n\n3/10."

What happened to the horses? This time it is deer? And I think they were reusing sets! All the time I was like I think I have seen this room before. Oh yeah it was the Morgans living room! Some parts I was falling asleep. **This is a big spoiler so if you are going to see the movie do not read the next lines!** My favorite part will be when Racheal is climbing out of the well. In the theater you could hear everyone saying don't do that you f*** a** Then Saumaura says Mommy. Then Rachael say, \"I'm not your f**** mommy.\" At that point I laughed and started clapping. Soon the whole theater joined in. I think Saumaura is not scary. Her voice made me laugh. Her appearance made me laugh. And also how do the people know that when she kills you you see the ring? BEcause all the people who have seen it are dead. But I guess that is Hollywood. This movie is like the exorcist but not as funny."

When I heard that the director of Ringu was behind it, I was surprised and overly optimistic, but alas, it still blew. From the overuse of water to the random animal attacks, this movie is both disappointing and boring. It even recycles EXACT images from The Ring, such as the well and the falling off a cliff bit. That being said, this movie has SOME good things about it.\n\nFor one, Naiomi Watts looks gorgeous and she plays her part well. The little kid as also kinda creepy and Sissy Spacek has a wonderful cameo. Also, some of the images are trippy and cool. Best of all is Rachel's quote of 'I'm not your ****ing mommy!\". This movie was actually a better movie on child abuse than it was about horror.\n\nOverall, this movie was extremely disappointing and crappy follow-up to The Ring, which remains to this day the only film that has genuinely scared me."

A level of dread is there from the very beginning but it never escalates. It sort of stays at the same beat throughout: Watts, back as Rachel, doesn't go on a journey of discovery here, uncovering further layers of horror. She already knows all about the tape and so do we. Yes, she does uncover further information about Samara, that now-tiresome spirit which doesn't go away and leave her and her son alone, but it's clich\u00e9. And then, midway, the only truly surprising sequence involves a sudden switch to the 'eco-terror' movies of the seventies, this time with killer deer. Say what? It's more hysterical than terrifying: the computer FX here don't work very well in sections of the sequence, as if rushed. And deer are the last animals I would pick to be scary; maybe that was the intent (the least expected animals) but it doesn't work for me. It was a central set piece and removing it probably wasn't an option. The rest of the pic, involving a form of possession, isn't anything new to horror and is even tedious. What's weird is after a saw this sequel, it suddenly occurred to me that the 'ring' may also refer to the phone ringing; but that may be because I watched the first Ring again."

        "review_detailed_main": "Once every few years, when a figurative blue moon rises, a good horror film will come along and delight those brave enough to watch it. The Ring, an original, extremely well made film that terrified moviegoers in 2002 easily falls into this category as one of the best \"scary\" movies to hit the big screen since the turn of the century. Heck, it was so influential with its slick imagery and high-grossing box office results that it even spawned literally half a dozen \"Japanese remakes\" since its release (including such films as The Grudge, and Dark Water).\n\nUnfortunately, because of The Ring's success, it was only a matter of time before Hollywood got greedy and pushed for a sequel to be fast-tracked into production. And even more unfortunately (mainly for audiences out there), yet not surprisingly, The Ring Two is nothing more than the \"clich\u00e9 sequel.\" It's redundant, it's boring, and only with the exception of the acting and directing, it's nothing more than a passable experience. The movie's tagline is \"Fear comes full circle,\" but, in the end, it felt to me like the only things coming \"full circle\" were the films plot points and \"shockers,\" as they were all used over, and over, and over again in a never ending circle, or, with a pun, a never ending ring of clich\u00e9s and events.\n\n\"Why is this?\" and unsuspecting fan of the first film may ask. Well, to answer that question, we can just look at the first film itself. It becomes obvious that the sequel, although dropping the whole \"tape\" idea very early on, follows almost the exact same sequence of events as it's predecessor. In short, both films follow Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), a curious journalist, as she tries to figure out the story behind a young girl, Samara, who was murdered years ago by her mother. She goes about doing this, in both movies, by traveling to specific locales throughout Oregon and Washington, such as Samara's old home, a decrepit mental institution, and an all-too-familiar well.\n\nThe only difference between The Ring Two and its superior prequel is that in this film, Samara not only tries to kill former \"tape watchers,\" but also tries to possess Rachel's son, Aiden (David Dorfman). As a result, he evolves from an already eerily mature boy into an extremely creepy boy. This character change, and this plot point should become the core of the movie, but, in reality, really only becomes a device to allow Rachel to go on her monotonous investigation. What results, to put it simply, is a boring take on a screenplay we've all seen way too many times before.\n\nHowever, as terrible as the screenplay ends up being, the film does have its high points (they're just not very high). First of all, the acting in the film, especially that of Naomi Watts, is fantastic. Furthermore, the casting of new characters, such as Samara's birthmother (Sissy Spacek) is dead on (after all, having the one and only \"carrie\" play a deranged, institutionalized wacko is bloody brilliant). Also, the return of Hideo Nakata (who directed the original Japanese version of The Ring, called Ringu) adds a less colorful, and more suiting tone for the movie to follow.\n\nOverall, although the return of Hideo Nakata, and above-par acting do benefit The Ring Two in many ways, they can't benefit it enough to save it from a dull, quite repetitive screenplay that drags the entire film into \"sequel damnation.\" Unless you're a die-hard fan of the first film (and you like feeling disappointment), you should just wait for this movie to hit your local Blockbuster or Hollywood video. $9.50 is just too much money for something you've certainly seen before.\n\nRating = 2/5"

The special effects are more prominent this time, but that should never be a carrying element in a film.\n\nNaomi Watts is both beautiful and believable, but the focus on Aiden is a bit too much and reminds us too much of the great 'The Sixth Sense'.

During the first Ring film, I was curled up in my cinema seat hiding behind my hands. I then bought the Japanese Trilogy because I enjoyed it that much (I enjoy being scared at films, call me crazy!). So I watched this film with high expectations. The (American)Ring was an exact replica of the Japanese version and it worked, hardly anyone in the western world had seen something so freaky. With Ring 2, they deviated from the series and turned it into an American teeny-bopper movie that no one under the age of 14 will find scary. This film is badly written with so inconsistencies. For example, Sissy Specek's infant told her to drown her to save her. And Aidan told Rachael to kill him to save him. Therefore, surely the spirit that possesses Aidan is not Samara if the infant said to do the same thing? Don't get me wrong, this film has some good points. ****SPOILER**** I love the way Samara crawls up the well at the end, with arms and legs all over the place. It was excellent visual work. As was the dead, green faces (excellent spec FX) and not forgetting the reindeer. But on the whole. This film is BAD (as in NOT GOOD). Anyone who's scared when Samara comes out of the TV screen after watching it so many times, will probably find this film scary. And, I just have to say, that line at the end \"I'm not your ******* Mommy!\" just cements its \"cheesiness\". Unfortunately, this is just another one of those movies that looks better in the trailer. Very disappointing!"

OK, I've heard of hydrophobia, and its a real thing, but how is it that hes like \"omg water on the floor\" but hes in the bathroom and the water's defying the laws of physics to float in the air and hes just sitting their in the bath \"...mommy....?\" AND WHO THE F*** TAKES A BATH WEARING PANTS? she pulled him out of the bathtub i was like \"I NEED AN ADULT\" but he was wearing pants so i was like \"Father Kenedy, false alarm\" ANOTHER stupid thing... OK picture this scenario... beautiful day, sun's shining, your out for a nice drive with your sun, you decide to take a scenic detour to explore the beauty of nature... oh look son, there's some nice flowers... and the trees are beautiful... and look at all the wildlife---BAM! oh s*** a deer hit us. oh, OK, wait OK, hold on... its just one little deer, oh, no... wait, there's like 3 more coming, son tell me what to do \"mom back up and go\" why son? \"no mom i can see visions in my head and if you don't back up and make these deer roadkill, we're going to die\" OK, hole on let me take a minute to pull the deer out of my window, I'm not gonna bother getting the windshield fixed either, ill leave it through the rest of the movie. OK (VROOM!) road rage YEAHHHH!\n\nBOSSTOWN BOYS\n\n@_@"

Plus, Samara somehow comes out of the videotape when Naomi burns it and gets inside the TV? I thought she would only make an appearance if someone actually watched the tape?? That being said, you could assume that the tape in the 2nd Ring has now become pointless and Samara will just simply become any old normal ghost that haunts people. Wow, good job sticking to the catch of the story...this movie was a waste of time and effort.\n\nI really wonder why the hell Naomi and whatever the hell that kid's name is even decided to do this movie? Did they read the script, with the f'n stupid mad-deer-disease scene and all, and then say \"Yeah, sounds good, I think it will do well.\" How much were they paid for this? Must've been a lot. Not like I really had an high expectations for this in the first place, thank god I did not see this in the theater."

It basically begins when a teenager knows that his time is up and the only way to live is to show the movie to another friend. He picks a lonely girl to watch it who is expecting a little more then a scary movie. He thinks that his plan is successful when he gets the girls to watch it but thinks twice when hes sees water leaking under his kitchen door. The beginning of the movie is great so you don't HAVE to see the first ring to even get the second one. Samara is creepier then ever and adding a few extra characters (Samara's mom, Evelen, and a new co worker friend)helps the movie out a lot. This movie is worth the 8 dollars I paid for it on Friday night and I think everyone else will agree!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This film tells how a young journalist, a single mother of a gifted child is affected by the story of Samara and the video tape that kills those who see it in seven days. Directed by Hideo Nakata, the film is the sequel to \"The Ring\", has a Ehren Kruger script and Naomi Watts in the lead role.\n\nWe are facing a sequel to one of the most popular thrillers in the recent years. Despite that, this film is far from expectations. I believe that the change of director (Nakata is the producer of Japanese film in which \"The Ring\" was initially inspired) has been a key factor for this failure. The film does not bring almost anything new, except to give Samara a more fierce and cruel aspect of what was in the original, with its huge hair remember me \"The Grudge\". But the truth is that the film intrigues more than scares, leaves the audience more curious than uncomfortable.\n\nThe actors were at a good level. Naomi Watts is an experienced actress and was perfectly capable of handling her role. David Dorfman continues to do a great job as Aidan, and how the young man handed the role is a lesson for many child actors aspiring to a career in the seventh art. Visually appealing, the film has a deliberately dark picture, away from light and warm colors. The sun rarely appears, the fog and rain are almost a constant. Everything contributes to thicken the atmosphere. The soundtrack, created by Hans Zimmer, contributes decisively to the public's rare moments of discomfort. The problem of the film is, decidedly, the script and the absence of a director who understands the aspirations of a public hungry for emotions. The film does not have emotions, never heats or cools. Worse, there are certain elements of the story that almost collide against the original film, cutting its logical connection, necessary for the understanding of the story."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well directed from a micro view with a few interesting moments, but poorly written, poorly constructed and generally ineffective sequel that by and large does not scare other than with the continual threat of death by boredom. Its actually two spliced together 1 hour shorts, the first is your traditional Friday the 13th Part XXIII type blop shown merely as tedious continuation, paint by numbers rehash of the first film, with virtually none of the first's ability to frighten. Naomi and her inscrutable Yoda of a son are on the lam from Samara, seeking a 'new life'. They stumble across (far too often) Part I type frights and happenings, one more ineffective the next, all in the supposed name of story development. The set-ups are so uninteresting and pointless that at one point I honestly almost turned it off to see what they were selling on QVC.\n\nThe second part of the film, admittedly has it merits as it turns, rather abruptly, from fun-house fright gags to more of a mystery/solution driven tale. We finally move forward instead of sideways and we begin to get some answers, albeit of the unconvincing and not particularly sound variety. As an example, sending Naomi once again to visit the Morgan horse farm and having her somehow stumble upon some vital new clues, is textbook inanity. Gary Cole I don't know why he would even take a role like this, Sissy Spacek as always is good, and really reaches back for a Carrie inspired tour de force if you can believe it. But its bad, with virtually no flow or even rational sense of continuity or mapping. The special effects are weak and unconvincing, especially the elk scene. The Hollywood ending, implausible and insulting. The main trouble of course is that Ring 2 is a horror movie...that doesn't scare you. And, if its possible, actually exorcised some of the lingering horror induced by the original. I would therefore seriously advise caution in watching this, its just not worth it for so many reasons."

I went to see \"The Ring Two\" because I wanted to be scared - that's all I came for.\n\nI was not disappointed. While the plot of this one isn't as strong as the plot of the first, it is still satisfying in that it resolves some questions left from the first. There are more creeps and scares in the sequel in the original, and, unbelievably, they are able to up the intensity to spine-tingling effect! If you like scary movies, give \"The Ring Two\" a try. Just make sure you see \"The Ring\" first, because they don't give you a summary to set the stage for what happens in the sequel. Remembering it while writing this review is giving me goosebumps even now, three weeks later! Enjoy!"

However, like any specter worth her salt, Samara has managed to track the pair down and quickly begins her scheme of possessing the boy as a way of returning to the land of the living.\n\nThis is an extraordinarily under-whelming thriller that is little more than a series of extremely mild shocks (if you even want to call them that) interrupted by long stretches of hopelessly dull exposition. The story itself makes very little sense, and the climax is so blas\u00e9 and half-hearted that I couldn't be sure the movie had actually ended until the credits started rolling by. \"The Ring 2\" has a few impressive special effects up its sleeve, but not nearly enough to relieve the tedium that afflicts so much of the movie.\n\nIn a mere two installments, this series seems already to have run its course.

The sole up side of Ring 2 would be a producers' decision not to go for another remake but instead the original script. However, that script proves to be weak, contrived and full of inconsistencies which makes it a tedious no-brainer. Naomi Watts and the kid are good but it's not nearly enough for a decent motion picture. The only ones who are really gonna love this film are teenagers whose mere purpose of going to the theater is to speak on their cell phones while \"watching\" a film and start a \"i-can-scream-louder-than-you\" competition. The Pg 13 rating tells you who they aimed it at. The Ring 2 is a huge step back for Hideo Nakata who lost a lot of my respect, specifically after I noticed he's behind a remake of \"The Eye\" as well ( that I know will suck big time ). Looks like Mr Nakata couldn't resist the $$$$$ call either..what a shame. If you want to see a real scary and well done horror with ghosts than try finding \"Shutter\" from Thailand and pray the vultures from Hollywood are not gonna ruin it with their lame remake."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Ring\" was an eerie ghost story that centered around Samara, a girl not-quite-dead that is able to attack her victims via a videotape. What really beefed it up to make it such an interesting and delightfully scary movie was the great style Gore Verbinski added to it. When \"The Ring Two\" was announced, with no Gore, I foresaw the sequel not living up to the original.\n\nAnd it hasn't. But it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Very early on in the trailer for \"Ring Two\" I could see that the visual style had been removed from the sequel: there was an eerie blue-green that pervaded the original \"Ring\" and it worked so well. I was disappointed by the removal of it, but it was probably a directing choice by Hideo Nakata, director of \"Ring Two.\" As you may or may not know, Nakata directed the original \"Ringu\" and it's Japanese successor. Many regard Verbinski's \"The Ring,\" though, as the ultimate telling of a story that has been remade at least two or three times in different countries.\n\nOne thing that's carried over from \"The Ring\" to it's sequel is Han Zimmer's excellent horror underscore. I appreciate this because I thought the original's score fit extremely well.\n\nNakata's influence is definitely here, and you can see a lot of Asian horror characteristics here. From my experience with Asian horror (especially \"The Eye\"), I've noticed that Asian directors are less likely to hold back on computer generated imagery, even if it looks fake, to tell a story the way they want it told. I bring this up because there is a point in the movie in which computer generated deer come into play. While it is a very fascinating scene, it is also hard to swallow since the deer look very computerized.\n\nThe story in this movie is intriguing and expands the myths of the videotape and Samara's origins. If you liked that whole part of the original, you'll definitely want to see \"Ring Two\" at least once. Unfortunately, the dialog is pretty bad and this movie suffers a case of \"let's review the original for the people who never saw it,\" where a whole scene is dedicated to Naomi Watts retelling the story. Scenes like this make me cringe. Another scene that was incredibly cheesy was when Naomi Watts attempts to destroy the videotape early on in the movie using a fire... did she forget how the \"system\" of it works or something? You can't just destroy the videotape. Of course, the movie goes on to show her that. The videotape, as it's burning in the fire lets out a screech with a \"mouth\" it kind of grows... what the hell was that about?\n\nThis movie is not scary, though. Don't see this if you want to be scared. You'll be disappointed. This movie can surprise you, though. It has a few of those \"trick\" shots where the movie will unexpectedly cut to a horrific image, but all that atmospheric greatness from the original is gone.\n\nWhen I was leaving the theater, I felt that the movie had a great core to it. But it ended up just too uneven. I think the three most obvious flaws are it's pacing, it's dialog and some unnecessary or peculiar scenes. It could've been better. I hear they're making a prequel... I hope Gore Verbinski will return for that. Nothing against Nakata, but it was jarring that he made a continuation of Gore Verbinski's stylized movie using his own style."

It also doesn't rely on shock scares, but on a creepy atmosphere for the ENTIRE movie. The movie nicely ties into the first and answers most of the questions that we still have. There are lots of scary scenes that make us wanna see more.\n\nCONS: The movie does move at a slower pace than the first one, and the middle section of the movie may not be as satisfying as the first one. Also, the movie does have more of a drama feel which is nice mostly, but at some points can drag some scenes out.\n\nOverall, its a fantastic movie!"

Due to which we saw so many fan-boy websites and discussion boards sprung over to explore the minuscule details and theories of that movie.\n\nAnd now after three years we see the sequel which shows how foolish the makers are to be able to spoil such a global franchise. The audience found themselves asking each other that whether it was the sequel of The Ring or Scary Movie 3. By the way there is no need for anything from the scary movie franchise for this one because The Ring Two makes fool of it and its loyal fan base.\n\nThe movie starts with the murder of a teenage boy by Samara in front of his girlfriend or no the girl was about to become a scapegoat for that boy as he was trying to show her the tape before his time is up which is only five minutes away but the girl is a nerd or smart, she puts on the tape and closes her eyes. And Rachel who now works for a paper in the very small town where that incident happened gets to know about it and when she sees the body of the boy she realizes that the curse is spreading and has reached too close for her comfort. So she steals the tape from the boy's house and burns it so that the curse thus not spread. But because of her doing that or some emotional need for a mother Samara possesses Aidan Rachel's son and the most disastrous sequel of the decade begins.\n\nAfter the possession the movie takes a detour into evil spirit territory, which leaves the audience cracking themselves up over the movies proceeding. We see CGI deer's attacking Rachel's car, after this nadir one would expect the director could not go any lower. But we are wrong and we witness one cringe worthy sequence after another, which halts the movies proceeding during its first half. At the beginning of the second half the movie ups the tempo with the suspense about Samara's mother, but at each step the reasoning of the unfolding events shows clear disconnect to logic that put the final nail in the coffin for the most promising horror franchise of this decade.\n\nThis was an unexpected and disappointing shock for its fan base with the suspense leaving much to desire, the movie even fails to conjure a note worth scary moment. The makers try to lift the movie's sagging energy by putting Samara on steroids as moves and climb up the well with pace & extreme flexibility with hilarious effect.\n\nFinally, if you are wondering why the herd of deer may have attacked Rachel's car then there is something you will find in the basement of the Morgan's; who were supposed to be horse breeders if I can recall!\n\nFor more reviews visit http://cinemadose.blogspot.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie \"The Ring\" was very tense, creepy, and brilliantly directed. Naomi Watts put her whole heart in her performance and Rachel Keller was more believable in the first. Now, Dreamworks has brought in the director of the original Ringu movies, and the style has been completely redone. It's obvious how much work the crew and actors put into this sequel, trying to make it creepier, more intense and terrifyingly weirder than the first supernatural thriller. But this movie fails shockingly and miserably on every category.\n\nThe Ring Two takes Rachel and her son Aidan to Oregon, recovering from escaping a horrible death after watching the scary cursed tape in Seattle and racing against time to discover Samara, who was drowned by her mother. I knew I was sorely disappointed by this movie when it opened with an attempted scare scene involving the tape like in the first, but just incredibly missing the creepy tone. Rachel hears about the death and connects it to the tape... then she is sent on another journey, uncovering secrets from Samara's past while her son is being possessed by her spirit.\n\nThe movie has amazing effects and apparent well planned cinematography. The camera-work here though is much different from the simple style that made the first scary. It's more in the fashion of the work done on \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\". And Naomi Watts is blatantly just reprising the role for her contract. There is no interest in her eyes... she isn't delivering the emotional role that made us care for her in the first. That's the problem- this dragged out movie that is as dragged out as this review, keeps pushing your attention away as it drones on and on about horrifying images and death.\n\nThe Ring Two is overshadowed by the first and is easy to miss. Samara comes out of the television a little too many times, and the movie has worn her creepy presence out. She should just stay in the well from now on."

I expected the sequel to be a downer, a complete disappointment lacking suspense and interest. I certainly did find some points repetitive and by the time Naomi's character, Rachel, finds the fifth or so person with the \"scared to death\" look on their face, I'm actually surprised she still screams and doesn't instead spew some profanity that she hasn't been able to stop Samaria yet again. All in all, this movie is not a bad sequel. If you read too many reviews and analyze it to death then you'll find the plot holes and the parts that don't make sense. (I'm still not sure what that whole deer scene was about). But if you approach it for what it is...a monster flick, (I mean come on, do you really believe someone could come out of your TV and kill you?!), well then it's a fun ride."

(I thought the original similar to Jaws, which was edgy on/around water but gave a rest when clearly away).\n\nNot only this, but the style and back story are 100% improved (on an already good movie) to provide more depth and context.\n\nI really don't like or generally enjoy horrors/scary movies, but this was just a great movie, that happened to have these thrilling/chilling elements in its core.\n\nStrange because I've generally found IMDb scores to appreciate the more thoughtful movies, and to reflect such themes as I've seen them. I thought Cloverfield deserved a better score but this really was a surprise."

I thought that the special FX are okay such as the deer, the water from the bath tub. The point of a horror is not special FX. Many horrors can be scary with just sounds and scary images. Some say that there are scary/frightening images in the Ring 2, but i can't remember any! The faces of the dead bodies in the first gave me nightmares but in this one I was laughing out loud. Everything in this movie is predictable there are no twists to it which is one thing it could have used. I was also disappointed to not hear the phone ring and the voice: 7 days... because thats got to be my favorite part of the first one. If you were scared in the first movie you may not be scared in this one.\n\nIf you weren't scared in the first, this one will not be scaring ya either."

She's not as appealing in Ring Two, but she is still the best thing about the movie.\n\nScariness: Mild, I don't think I heard a single scream in a crowded theater.\n\nGore: None, a couple of people are scared to death. That's it.\n\nSpecial Effects: There are relatively few special effects and they are unimpressive.\n\nLogic: The premise of first movie didn't make a whole lot of sense. After all, how can watching a video tape kill people? But the first Ring was really creepy and a lot of fun. Ring Two is even more illogical but has few redeeming qualities.\n\nMy Take: Despite being a big fan of the original movie, I can't say that I was expecting much from the sequel because the trailer looked terrible. Sometimes you get a bad trailer for a good movie, but not this time. Naomi Watts is fine, but she can't save the movie. The worst problem is that this \"scary\" movie is not scary at all. I would even go further; it's boring. The Grudge is the real successor to The Ring. The Ring Two pales in comparison."

After killing a teenager in a small Washington town, she, for some reason, decides to go after old enemy Watts and son Dorfman. Ring Two is nothing to do with the superior Japanese film, though original director Hideo Nakata replaces Gore Verbinski at the film's helm.\n\nThe Ring Two has its moments, but is shockingly uneven. The use of CGI doesn't fit with this type of film and some scenes are particularly laughable (watch out for the flying water). With a lack of real scares, Ring Two relies on horror at a psychological level, but is not inventive and most of the horror is re-hashed from either the first film or \"The Exorcist\".\n\nThe acting is generally of a good standard. Watts provides a solid, if slightly underplayed performance as Rachel. The brightest star if the film is youngster David Dorfman who is particularly good as Aidan. Elizabeth Perkins is, as usual, believable as the psychologist. Sissy Spacek is disappointingly mellow as Samara's mother, but is satisfactory.\n\nThe Ring Two is a poor attempt at a horror sequel which has lost all surprise and menace. If you have seen and enjoyed the American Ring film, then you may get something from this but I doubt it. If you are a fan of the Japanese originals, steer clear as you will be disappointed. This remake has none of the originality that made the Japanese sequels so fresh and is merely a poke at the teen-horror box office pie.\n\n4/10 - Below Average"

Elizabeth Perkins plays a shrink, Gary Cole has a minor role as a real estate agent, and Sissy Spacek plays Sarama's birth mother. Good cameos, but unfortunately, thats all they are. No character is developed in any way - not even the ghost.\n\nI didn't think it was worth the money to spend - its slow and boring. I just wanted to see the history of Sarama, but the movie just breezes thru who she is and why she's haunting Naomi Watts' character Rachel.\n\nOverall, this movie does not meet my expectation for scary / horror. It just doesn't have the fear factor in it of the original. However, if you get the DVD and watch the little mini-film called \"Rings\", you'll be scared half out of your mind!"

As a sign of how the original has caught on, there were an abundance of teenagers in the theater, albeit few seemed to understand movie-theater etiquette. Anyone with any lick of sense knows that few can/will write a review of a sequel that applauds it as good as the original. With that said, I will do my best to describe the film knowing you already expect to be at somewhat disappointed.\n\n\"The Ring Two\" picks up pretty much where the first left off. Rachel (still played by Naomi Watts) and Aidan (David Dorfman) decide to leave the big city for small-town life in order to get away from the terrors they experienced there. But it appears Samara is still in \"circulation\" when a copy of the horrific and lethal tape turns up in town and kills a teenager. Rachel discovers the body to be afflicted by the same frozen scream-like expression that acts as Samara's calling card. It is at this moment that Samara finds where Rachel and Aidan have moved to. But rather than continue to torment society with her morbid video-tape, Samara set her sights on a real life again through Aidan.\n\nThis film dances around trying to develop the complex and bizarre story of the original, but only offers small substance in its attempt. We still don't really understand why Aidan calls his mother Rachel. In fact, rather than offer an explanation, it tries to use that enigma to aid the plot. I thought the same thing this time around as I did during the first, \"odd\". As to the visual effects, suspense, and general mind job that was given in the first, expect less in \"The Ring Two\". There are a few good scenes that will make you jump, especially one involving CG deer. But even the deer scene leaves some unanswered questions, one of which is how does Volkwagen make such a strong car? And the ending is a bit of let down in how easy our heroes succeed. But did they really succeed...? Kudos to Naomi Watts and David Dorfman for a great job acting. 4/10 P.S.: Don't worry about sleeping with the lights off after this one."

        "review_detailed_main": "I would like to be able to replace the word 'duped' with 'drunk,' because that would've been so much more enjoyable, but nooooooooooooo! (Channeling John Belushi here.) I had to go out and rent movies to play catch-up. So I got THE RING 2 along with HIDE AND SEEK, hoping that between the two of them, there was a really good scary movie in there somewhere.\n\nThanks to the producers of both flicks, I now have complete verification of the main thing that has been troubling me about movies these days.\n\nIt ISN'T just me. Movies really do suck now! The sequel to last year's horror hit has only two things going for it: a capable cast, and the cachet brought to the production by the fact that Hideo Nakata, the original director of the J-Horror versions that started it all has come on board. To his credit, Hideo knows creepy. Hideo knows water. Hideo knows his way around a great method of blocking scenes.\n\nHideo by this time, however, probably wishes he'd never met Ehren Kruger, and I (and the many people who lost two bits and two hours on this piece of crap), would wholeheartedly agree.\n\nNaomi Watts is back as Rachel Keller, who, blahblahblah...why bother? You've probably already read this a trillion times throughout the last few reviews you read before this one.\n\nA sign of laziness on my part, friends? Or is that just how disgusted I was with the whole deal? Let me put it to you this way...halfway through, I found myself idly wishing that Samara would come through my TV set, strangle me and put me out of my misery, so I wouldn't have to watch the rest of it! That's how bad it was.\n\nWanna save yourself from my cruel fate? Go rent MONSTER-IN-LAW. Yes, I did just advise you to rent a Jennifer Lopez movie. At least if the acting is horrible, you get unintentional laughs along with it. The only one laughing here, folks, are the people who will have your money after you spend it on this, and can't get a refund."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's impossible these days to talk about horror films without mentioning other horror films, particularly the recent rash of the obnoxiously-labeled \"J-horror\" films. Remake fever and sequelitis have condemned beautifully-crafted Japanese films The Grudge, the original Ring and the upcoming Dark Water, all of which have a serious pedigree that go back several decades, to the dreaded Hollywood revamp. Fifty years of films like masterpieces like Onibaba and Kwaidan - it's not something you can tart up with a fresh coat of paint and the actors from Scooby-Doo.\n\nThen again, even Japanese horror has its stinkers. Ring 2 (Japanese version), the second and weakest of a three-film franchise, was like a Nightmare On Elm St sequel - silly, noisy and ultimately pointless. Hollywood Ring screenwriter Ehren Kruger thankfully jettisoned Ringu 2's rehash and mishmash and came up with some original ideas for the follow-up. Well, original for Hollywood. Hopefully attempts to turn The Ring's ghost-child Samara into a Freddy Krueger for the SMS Generation will fall flat, and Tinseltown can move on from its J-centric obsession.\n\nNaomi Watts returns as Rachel Keller, as does David Dorfman as her creepy son Aidan. Now in secluded Astoria, Oregon, the curse of the video tape has followed them - in Ring 2's Scream-like opener a teen thrill-seeker is found with the familiar open-jawed look of abject terror. Rachel destroys the tape, but it appears Samara wants Aidan (\"I see dead fishes\") to be her host, and she's looking for a new Mommy. Aidan's soon freezing to the touch and has hand-shaped bruises on his back; even reindeer hate him. A sanitarium visit to Samara's biological mother Evelyn (a show-stopping performance from Carrie herself, Sissy Spacek, still in her Loretta Lynn fright wig) convinces Rachel that Samara wants back into the dating game, and David is her return ticket.\n\nEven with the original Japanese director Hideo Nakata at the helm - a ploy used by The Grudge with depressingly similar results - these American remakes simply don't work. The Japanese versions are simultaneously silly and creepy; American ones are just plain silly. Japanese films have a tendency to downplay the drama to amplify their shocks, which American productions crudely attempt to ape. American actors thus appear to sleepwalk through their roles. The Grudge's casting trump card was a soporific Sarah Michelle Gellar; in Ring 2 it's The Guardian's heavy-lidded Simon Baker. An interesting casting choice, pitting two former Aussie soap stars against each other; Watts is certainly a long way from Summer Bay. I for one look forward to Harold Bishop's successful relocation to Hollywood.\n\nRing 2 has an interesting dynamic that Nakata has explored before in his film Dark Water, the child's disconnection from its parent (Aidan calls his mother Rachel, and authorities believe Rachel is beating her child). A much creepier film would have been Naomi Watts trying to destroy her son in order to save him - without the supernatural element. Call me sadistic, but I think it would work. Dark Water also features an orphaned ghost looking for a living mother, and Samara's staccato spider-walk up the well recalls The Grudge (itself an attempt to out-do Ringu, on which Nakata was technical adviser), as well as Linda Blair's restored upside-down stroll in The Exorcist: Director's Cut. All familiar elements which resonate with Nakata's Japanese work, but with less than spectacular results.\n\nThe film emerges from its slumber when Nakata goes to work hammer and tongs on two quite preposterous set-pieces. First, an entire herd of CGI reindeer hammer Rachel's car into scrap metal. Its meaning? Reindeer are sacred in Japan, says Nakata. Maybe they don't like working with child actors. Second is a bathtub sequence (the old J-horror standby) where the water forms a vortex around Aidan and floods the ceiling. It's both a triumph for special effects, and a vain attempt to breathe life into a drowned beast.\n\nA final word to the Hollywood producers of the Oldboy remake: Judd Nelson in the title role. Think about it and give me a call."

        "review_detailed_main": "When \"The Ring\" came out a few years ago, it single-handedly dethroned every horror movie I had ever seen. It had a good story line, good acting, and very disturbing imagery. Not only did the movie make me jump, it was just creepy all together. I knew it would be difficult for the 2nd one to top this 1st. I was very very disappointed when I found out Gore Verbinski was not available to do the second one. I could not believe that the Ringu director would be doing this one. Japanese people make the WORST horror movies on the planet. This guy wasn't even the 2nd pick, they went to him as a last resort because nobody else was available. Their movies are very very cheesy, use horrible special effects that should have never been used in the first place, and use really lame tactics to try to scare people. The Grudge was a perfect example of this. American film makers make the best horror films on the planet. Gore took Ringu and completely turned it around. The first thing I noticed about The Ring 2 was the absence of the dark, gloomy Tim Burtonish atmosphere that Gore used in the first one. Every element in this movie was typical in Japanese style horror movies. Not a single scene made me jump or gave me the creeps. Samara was a total joke, she looked exactly like the girl from The Grudge, bright black hair streamed over the face with very fast and tacky movements. Certain imagery from the first one was used to strengthen this movie but it failed to match the first one. I also hated the way the story revolved around Aidan. That just made the story even more pathetic. From this day on I refuse to watch any horror movie made by a Japanese person in theaters. I'll just rent it. For those that loved the first one, this is not even close in my opinion. This to me is what Terminator 3 was to Terminator 2. My biggest complaints about this movie is bad scare tactics, weak story line,and excessive use of cheesy effects."

A lot of what it did have to do with seemed pretty random and just thrown in to scare you. That's all well and good for a horror flick, but if everything was tied in together to somehow make sense in coordination with the first film, this movie would have been better. It also would have helped if what did tie in with the first film didn't ruin what was initially creepy, for instance, the issue of Samara's parentage. A lot of the dialogue was odd or awkward, especially Rachel's bit of advice for Aidan in the beginning. There was very little gradual understanding; the characters just lay it out for you. I won't spoil the ending, but I personally didn't like it. The special effects were excellent, but I've always been more for plot that shiny visuals.\n\nOverall, I won't say that The Ring Two was bad, but it didn't live up to its predecessor.

Though, those plans are turned upside down when a mysterious death happens in the town and all the evidences turns to unmarked videotape that Rachael finds at the crime scene, but that's the least of her problems. She soon discovers that Samara is after her son and eventually possesses him. So now it's up to Rachael to find out a way to finally rid herself and Aidan from the curse of Samara that won't let them go.\n\nWhat a disappointment! After being surprised by \"The Ring\" remake, which was atmospherically gripping, but \"The Ring Two\" was the exact opposite. Rather bland and uneventful comes to mind\u0085 jeez, it was a snooze fest! One of the problems was the dire story and but also the lazy script, which took the cake. Even though writer Ethan Kruger (The Ring, Arlington Road) goes for a different approach than actually rehashing what happen in the first, which is great, but still nothing of any real interest happens and there were too many flat spots, nor do you really care for the characters, as they aren't fleshed out this time around. Instead of the cursed videotape it's more a throwback to the possession films that filled the 70's and there's even a sub-plot involving child abuse against Rachael, but really it just felt tired and contrived. The investigation that we watch Rachael go through isn't as intriguing like in the first film and that's because they try to over explain the curse. In that case it's hard to get creep out when you know too much and when they are trying to make you feel sorry for the spirit. This is why I enjoy the Japanese versions more, which they don't try over killing the back-story of the curse and that's what makes it more ominous. But the film's major sin was that it wasn't particularly frightening, or atmospheric. Sure there was some great imagery on show, but hey its got to have some unnerving touch to be effective, which it sorely lacked in my eyes. What made it even more disappointing was that Japanese director Hideo Nakata who took over the helm from Gore Verbinski, couldn't translate the blend of thrills and discomfort of his earlier and far better films \"Ringu\" and \"Ringu 2\" into this Hollywood sequel. Sure, he brings his own brand of direction and eye for detail to film, but still it far from entertaining. The acting was rather one note. Naomi Watts looks like she was going through the emotions. David Dorfman was incredibly annoying this time around. Simon Baker had a thankless role and Sissy Spacek had an amusing, but all to short cameo. No one really did any favours to help lurch this film from the bottom of the barrel. The overall production just felt rushed and incomplete, making it feel like it was made for only commercial reasons.\n\nAgain, all I can do is just express my disenchantment in this lacklustre effort.\n\nInstead check out the DVD extras, which has a short film called \"Rings\"\u0085 it's far creepier and fairly riveting in its execution. It also relates back to the opening sequence of \"The Ring Two\"."

It's astounding how bad this movie is compared to the Japanese version or a matter of fact, any other Ring-related movie. Even though Naomi Watts and David Dorfman return from the original film, they end up trapped in a flick featuring a boring script and uninspired directing from Hideo Nakata, who should know better. After all, he himself directed Ringu 1 & 2. It's shocking how the quality has dropped in his translation to American horror movies. They couldn't even get the same girl back to play the evil Samara, so Kelly Stables has replaced Daveigh Chase as the villain of the film. That should be a sign that certain sequels just shouldn't be made. The first film stood alone as a great scary movie to watch alone or with friends on a dark Saturday night. This second movie in the series is so disappointing that it cheapens the effect of the first one just knowing that this one is around. You'd do better to check out the Japanese originals for the Ring and Ring 2 or just watch the American version of The Ring again. All three are much more entertaining than this piece of studio mediocrity. The Ring Two is not even worthy as a rental. It's boring, slow-paced, badly written and very uninspired even for a sequel. Move along, there's nothing to see here folks."

Sissey Spacek is a very good actress, but seemed very limited in her small role. Watts also does an OK job (and it could be just me) but her acting was weak. Ah well, it's a good film anyways.\n\nWell acted, directed, and written, but the CG effects just felt like they were too overdone, something which the original American Ring did a good job of avoiding. The beginning and ending, after looking back, aren't the best parts, but all I can say is that you won't waste your money seeing this film, if you saw the original."

There was many of pointless parts in the film that just didn't need to be there. All the way through the film was clues, but as you later realise the clues lead to you to nothing, and have no significance in the film.\n\nAll the way through the film I expected something to happen that would make this film as good as the first but as much as I hoped nothing happened.\n\nFor me this film was a great disappointment, but some might say it was good so I'm not going to say don't see, everyone has there opinion and you should see it for yourself and make your own mind up."

For me, it's near an 8 or a 9.\n\nThe beauty of The Ring Two is that having been a fan of the Japanese franchise, and learning this would be a completely new film, I had no idea where they were going to take it. The trailers were very interesting but again, offered no clues as to where the film was going.\n\nThere's a reason for that.\n\nYou see, the filmmakers and I had something in common. I had no idea where they were going to go with this film, and neither did they. The film is a confused mess with barely a plot thread stringing it together, certainly a hallmark low for hack writer Ehren Kruger.\n\nBut that's the charm of it, I guess. It's so confused, and wants to show you all kinds of cool stuff, that the movie itself has been lost. It's no more a clone of the original film than of any of the other films in the Ring canon.\n\nBut it IS entertaining, and charmingly bereft of a real plot. On the one hand, it's disappointing - the concept of the original is rife with possibilities for a sequel - but on the other, it's sort of grand in its utter inability to capitalize on anything.\n\nIt's a curiosity of a film that should be seen, if anything, for its utter confusion.\n\nI loved it."

        "review_title": "\"...not in quite some time has a horror sequel failed so miserably...\"",
        "review_detailed_main": "Not in quite some time has a horror sequel been so ambitious. Simultaneously, not in quite some time has a horror sequel failed so miserably, as to not only embarrass its cast and denounce its predecessor, but to sink to the depths of the plot-holed, empty-hearted abyss of horror disgraces currently occupied by \"The Grudge\" and \"Boogeyman.\"\n\nUnlike most of my peers, I was and still am a fan of \"The Ring.\" I believe \"Ring\" sported one of the most original and effective televised marketing ploys ever. Before the previews, before the hype and before any word got out about the film, if you were to watch a television program after 11PM, and stuck around for the commercials, every now and then the television would fizz out after a couple commercials. Then the actual creepy videotape would play out in its entirety, followed by an additional fizz out, followed by the next commercial. You wouldn't know what you just watched, but you'd feel crept out. Extremely crept out. This type of originality and innovation fueled the hype of the original, and added to the trepidation of the videotape itself.\n\nAs far as originality goes in the sequel, the only innovative aspect was the connected story. In the first, Aidan (Dorfman) was Rachel's (Watts) ominous son whose sole purpose seemed to be warning Rachel about Samara (Stables). Like innumerable other horror films, he appeared to be the generic freak son who only spooks, but doesn't enhance nor progress. However, in the follow-up Aidan is clearly not only an important character, but also a mandatory one as Samara's entire motive revolves around the fact that he's Rachel's child.\n\nShort of the ambitious attempt to create a film that answers the questions left behind in the first, \"Ring 2\" basically fails on every other conceivable level. Every scare is as obvious as the horrendously unappealing and insulting CGI. Early on, Rachel and Aidan are attacked by a mob of angry elk (Funny as that may sound) so conspicuously computerized, that it's very possible that they were the forgotten reject reindeer's of \"Santa Clause 2.\"\n\nWhereas in the original, a bustling city harbored the slow-paced terror of Samara, the second takes place in Suburbia, USA and ironically moves a lot faster, draining Samara of her initial dread. \"Ring\" set an atmosphere, mainly due to Gore Verbinski, which is absolutely omitted in the second. Samara just is not scary in Hideo Nakata's hands.\n\nWhile the concept of Samara wanting to inhibit Aidan might sound creative (Which I think does), the actual way screenwriter Ehren Kruger went about it is ludicrous and laughable. What originally started as an \"out-to-get-ya\" horror series, ends up being a stupid \"I-want-my-momma\" dramady.\n\nIf the translucent story doesn't persuade one of a lack of resolutions, perhaps the fact that Samara is now telekinetic, can talk and possess, will. Without explanation, Samara can drag people into televisions, make others stab themselves in the neck with hypodermic needles and is only oblivious to what people are saying when they're asleep. Yet it strikes me as strange that an all-hearing, all-powerful ghost can still eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich without noticing that it's packed to the brim with crushed sleeping pills.\n\n\"Ring 2\" contains absolutely none of its predecessor's entrancement, and is hardly worth a single viewing even if \"Ring\" is amongst your favorite horror films. As opposed to the original's attempts to at least explain and foreshadow impractical events, the only foreshadowing here is Verbinski's disassociation. Completely depleted of scares, intelligible storytelling, and meaningful characters, the only thing that should \"come full circle\" is my nine bucks."

Third, the plot did not make sense and the worst of all it doesn't leave you guessing like the first one. It was very predictable and I think they should of gave this one a little more thought before they filmed it. The only thing that made this movie from really becoming ridiculous was the performance by Niomi Watts, she was the only thing that kept this movie from becoming really stupid.\n\nTo anybody who wants to see this movie, I suggest buying or renting something that better for your money than this."

        "review_detailed_main": "Six months after Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) and her son Aidan (David Dorfman) were terrorized by the mysterious video tape and its spiritual inhabitant Samara Morgan, they've moved to a new town where the terror begins anew when Rachel finds an unmarked videotape at the crime scene.\n\nThe plot doesn't particularly sound exciting considering it sounds exactly like the original. However, The Ring was a very good film so I had high hopes for the sequel. Maybe I should have lowered them a bit as this film isn't very good. It starts off promising before taking a turn for the worst. The first 30 minutes or so were pretty good. Then, the film starts focusing on the subplot of Samara trying to take over Aidan and that's when the film becomes dull.\n\nThe Ring 2 had some scares and had some moments of creativity. However, for the most part the film was nothing special and just not something you would expect from The Ring franchise. It could have been a good movie though. The atmosphere was right and most of the characters were back. The opening scene was also pretty good and the new characters were fairly interesting. However, there were a few moments in the film when I was thinking \" why would you do that?\" or \"don't you remember what happened before, that wouldn't be a good idea\" They seemed to have made the characters more stupid and they were acting like they would in a slasher film. That's something I would expect from that type of film but not from a more serious horror film.\n\nThe acting was pretty good all around. Naomi Watts gives a good performance as Rachel and I can't wait to see her in King Kong. David Dorfman is really good at playing a scary kid and gives an effective performance as Aidan. The supporting roles are also strong and they are played by Sissy Spacek and Elizabeth Perkins.\n\nIt would make sense for Hideo Nakatato to direct this film since he directed the Japanese version and all. However, Gore Verbinski is a pretty good director and he did a pretty good job with the original. So, I wouldn't have minded if he was directing. Many people are complaining that the deer scene ruined the film. I thought that it was pretty scary and unexpected. Sure, the deer may have looked really fake but that didn't ruin the scene too much. Besides for the actors, this film isn't really worth watching. It may make a decent rental but that's not a guarantee and if you do end up watching it then you should get the unrated version. In the end, The Ring 2 is a disappointing and dull sequel, approach with caution. Rating 5/10"

The film is not so much a \"scary\" film, but more tense. However there are some very jumpy bits, and parts which are not for the faint hearted. Overall this is a brilliant film which I would highly recommend to any fans of \"The Ring\" Prequel - you will not be disappointed!! I just hope they don't make a third film, because it feels like they have taken the story far enough."

The Ring is within my top five favorite horror flicks of all time, so a sequel is expected to fail. I found the only good aspect was the acting of the son. While watching I thought it was mediocre but I realized that everything he did was scripted and well executed. So if you see this movie with low expectations, you will most likely not regret it."

        "review_title": "It's not scary, but works more as a psychological thriller.....",
        "review_detailed_main": "I think the main fact that this sequel isn't as scary or as thrilling as the first is because you already know Samara is an evil out of this world being which you slowly discovered in the first. That is what made the first one suspenseful and builds up to the climatic TV scene. However, in the second one, all you mainly get is some water scenes in a bathtub, possession of the young Aidan and some badly done CGI deer attacking their car.\n\nThis uses cheap thrills rather than playing on your mind, and really doesn't leave room for much imagination. However, I did find the whole mother son relationship quite interesting, though it seems to go down this whole path of child abuse and questionable parenting themes in the second half. Naomi Watts is once again, brilliant, but doesn't have much to work with here.\n\nWhat I liked a lot about the first Ring was that it used great atmospheric cinematography to create the mood of gloominess, mystery and the feeling of leading to unpending doom. In this one, it doesn't use that as much, but it can be forgiven considering this movie is more about getting on with life instead of chasing the past the first one dealt with. Simon Baker's character could have been used more - they didn't go into the whole love interest thing, which can be refreshing for once, though I felt he wasn't really utilised well.\n\nSo it works on some levels, but on others it falls flat. Hideo Nakata who directed the original Ringu uses too much style I think and the water effects don't work well here. I think it's because well.....simply it doesn't seem scary and fits more with the Japanese culture and terror. For westerners, water is more like a problem of bad plumbing.\n\nAlso, what makes Asian horror films scary is that it doesn't rely on fast shots or fast story telling - it slowly builds it up and you go along with it slowly and then you discover the horrors on the way. That's where the first American Ring succeeded - in this one Samara feels more like a girl who got lost somewhere on the street and is out to find her Mum again - oooh very scary.\n\nThis is not a bad film, but it's not a great one. Don't expect to be jumping out of your seat, but if you enjoy psychological thrillers, this one will probably just satisfy you."

They attempted to put more story behind it then a bunch of kids passing around a video tape and getting killed one by one in typical horror fashion. Although the story itself grew increasingly stupid and confusing right up towards the end, it played out a lot differently then I thought it would when i first seen that they were doing the sequel.\n\nThe acting was terrible, but I still don't believe that should be a factor in a horror movie, cmon we wanna be scarred and just like any horror movies as of late, the ring 2 just couldn't deliver.

It provides very cheap thrills with long, drawn out dialogue and little suspense. I did enjoy one scene in the film that involves elaborate water CGI but that was hardly worth the price of a full admission. Sissey Spacek provides a cool cameo but what she says doesn't make a lot of sense. Then there is the child actor! He attempts to be 'Six Sense' creepy but just ends up being a bad kid actor. His scenes aren't scary, they're laughable. I suppose if you're a fan of the first 'Ring' you will feel obligated to see this movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "The producers released The Ring 2 three years after the first film, perhaps because, at that time, film corporations didn't make films as an industrial production line. However, The Ring 2 seems like a cheap manufacturing product.\n\nWith the moderate hype of The Ring 4, I decided to rewatch the American franchise. I remembered the first film well, but the second not that much, perhaps because the second film in the franchise was considerably weak compared to the first? We shall see.\n\nAt this point, the franchise has clearly deviated from Koji Suzuki's book series, and overall, that kind of creative freedom is valid. I don't mind it at all.\n\nThe Ring 2 starts out hilariously and that's unacceptable. The opening scene succeeds in raising so many questions about how someone else got their hands on the cursed tape, increasing expectations, but the end of the scene is comical, the quality of the visual effects low, marked by the death of a 2005-emo-punk stereotype.\n\nThe plot holes in The Ring 2 are what destroy the film. Because of the opening scene, we know that the cursed tape has spread somehow. The ending of the first film makes it clear that Rachel and Aidan chose to save themselves, implying that they condemned someone. That's an important fact but buckle up: the film ignores that. The story in general does not gratifyingly explain facts, focusing only on the collection of unnecessary jumpscares.\n\nUpon reaching the third act, we realize that not much happened. In general, Rachel is just drooling around the corners as the film introduces and removes subplots as quickly as Samara seems to gain inexplicable superpowers.\n\nIn the middle of it all, we have one of the candidates to the title of most useless side character in a story: Max. In Rachel and Aidan's arc, his function is just to exist. Removing Max from the story wouldn't alter any of the significant events, which, by the way, are minimal.\n\nAt the end of the day, The Ring 2 feels like just exploitation, a leech movie that tries to exploit the success of its predecessor. I recommend this movie only if you plan to watch all the movies in the franchise."

        "review_detailed_main": "...you can't really blame director Hideo Nakata for it. I think he has a very different style that simply does not resonate with the majority of American viewers, particularly those who are fans of Gore Verbinski's original American remake. That said, this was not a very good movie. There was no plot to speak of, the mystique of Samara was completely killed, the ending made no sense, and there was no real mood. Whereas in the original (American) movie Samara was simultaneously a pitiful little girl and a truly disturbing monster, in this movie she's simply annoying. And no offense to the girl who played Samara here, but she didn't really work for me. Characters came and went and were never spoken of again. The character Max served no real purpose. The same with Emily. Lapses in logic (such as Aidan and Rachel going to Rachel's office in the middle of the night only to find all her coworkers there as well, or Aidan simply trotting out of the hospital and no search mounted for him)insult the viewer's intelligence. The only scene that worked for me was the one where they are at the fair. Nakata does a nice job of portraying a scene of odd surrealistic unease. Other than that, this movie is a pretty poor effort."

Then a few years later i watch the remake, i think it's not as great as the original, but i think the remake is scarier. After i watch the remake, i watch the sequel of the remake. My expectation were HUGEEEEEE, and... Yeah, boredom kills me. Okay, i'm not a film critic, so i don't know what makes this movie boring, but ONE reason it's suck is that Samara is on screen TOO MUCH, like TOO MUCH. Instead actually create suspenseful, creepy moment, this movie goes with jumpscare, jumpscare, and jumpscare. Samara appears every 8 minutes is an effing crime. Yes, there's cool scene like when the water rising from the bathub, and actually suspenseful scene like the well sequence in the climax, but there's also many, MANY generic scares. Like come on."

        "review_detailed_main": "First, I have to say that I was a huge Ring 1 fan. I was overly excited about the 2nd movie. All three Ring movies were a hit in their native Asian country. Therefore, I was hoping that each were possibly as good as #1. Plus, the creator of The Ring was going to direct #2, this also made me hope that it might be another great sequel. As you can imagine, I was horribly disappointed. Ring 2 is looks more like a movie making fun of all the stupid things about Ring 1.\n\nThe main problem is that the movie isn't really about anything. In Ring 1 things were discovered, although many things remained ambiguous. The idea of having no idea what this creepy girl could do, or why she was doing it is what made one so great. Here, the people got smarter and now know exactly what she wants. Also, the main plot of one is completely abandoned. The whole \"die after a week\" thing is scrapped in favor of a stupid \"water control\" thing. Then there's the angry deer and the digital photos stuff\u0085not creepy. Plus, not even one \"she's coming out of the TV\" shot. Just think if when they made the Indiana Jones sequels, the decided to not use anything that made the first one a hit. That's what this is\u0085a disastrous disappointment."

It was boring and that damn tape, the first installment was enough bu a second round and maybe a third???? There were too many dreams and nightmares that you couldn't work out if the film was serious or not. I would expect more from it, the first was amazing and enough, a second clearly wasn't needed and whats supposed to happen in the third???????"

They are the ones who really make everything real and they just all do such a great job. I especially like David Dorfman (Aiden Keller) and Niomi Watts (Rachel Keller) they both did a great job and seeing as though David is only a kid- that makes it even better! Another thing I really enjoyed in the ring 2 was the whole story line. A lot of people said it was hard to follow/understand and that it really made no sense, well if you just pay a lot of attention and follow what there doing, its pretty understandable. Its a good movie and maybe its not like the first one, but its still good and I think it was totally worth seeing. GOOD JOB!"

        "review_detailed_main": "In a curious twist, the American studio DreamWorks handed the reins of \"The Ring Two\" back to Hideo Nakata, the director of the original Japanese film. While this might seem like a logical choice, it's precisely where the film falters. Nakata, even in his native Japan, is a director of middling talent, and his sensibilities simply don't mesh with the American production.\n\nDespite the valiant efforts of Naomi Watts, David Dorfman, Simon Baker, Elizabeth Perkins, and the legendary Sissy Spacek, the film succumbs to a downward spiral. The localization efforts of Ehren Kruger, layered upon the original screenplay by K\u00f4ji Suzuki (the author of the source material) and Hiroshi Takahashi, result in a narrative that feels disjointed and patched together.\n\nAnother misstep by the studio is the choice of cinematographer Gabriel Beristain, whose work on \"Dolores Claiborne\" (1995) was exceptional, but his experience is primarily in television. Beristain struggles to capture the atmospheric essence of \"The Ring,\" attempting to elevate the visuals to another level but ultimately falling short.\n\nThe third film in the series is best left unmentioned, so I recommend this film only to those who, like me, will watch anything with Naomi Watts in it. Her performance is a bright spot in an otherwise underwhelming sequel. Watts brings a depth and emotional intensity to her role as Rachel Keller, the journalist haunted by Samara's curse. Her desperation to protect her son Aidan (David Dorfman) is palpable, and her interactions with the other characters are imbued with a sense of urgency and dread.\n\nHowever, even Watts's talent can't salvage the film's convoluted plot and inconsistent tone. The scares are less effective, the pacing is uneven, and the overall impact is significantly diminished compared to the original American remake.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Ring Two\" is a disappointing sequel that fails to capture the magic of its predecessor. Despite a talented cast and a promising premise, the film is ultimately undone by its misguided direction and a script that lacks the coherence and chilling atmosphere of the original."

They have abandoned their old lives as a result of the evil Samara and hope they have escaped her and can move on. However, when a local homicide particularly reports of a kid who died with some kind of 'face', Rachel gets on the scene to find that it seems Samara's back and up to her old tricks again.\n\nThe rest of the movie sees all 3 of them in a kind of head to head with Samara possessing Aidan and threatening to stay around for good.\n\nOK, that would be a fair synopsis. Now for the the review: .....*drumroll*.....\n\nThis is bad. Really, really, really bad.\n\nNow I'll tell you why.\n\nWhat \"The Ring\" got right was that it was pretty faithful to the original Japanese movie which was such a smash hit in the first place. By not messing too much with the previous formula and avoiding 'Hollywoodising' the story to the usual popcorn extent, the remake was reasonably effective as a psychological chiller.\n\nThe problem with the sequel is it has *nothing* to do with the original Japanese franchise; it's an all new side-branch story. While in itself there's nothing wrong with this as it stands, it becomes an issue when Hollywood overblows it with, for example, ridiculously overplayed background music, and comedic interludes, some intentional, some not so.\n\nThe Ring Two has taken a great premise and turned it into an average Yank horror. There's nothing new here, apart from one singularly smart scene which works well (And it's not scary, merely impressive), and the great strength of the whole Ring 'empire' is the sheer originality of it. Ring was simply stunningly seminal horror, Ring 2 recaptured a lot of the original magic with some shiny technophobery, Ring 0 was a great tale, and the remake managed to translate a lot of the aspects from all 3 into a pretty decent and workable film for the western market.\n\nThis crude effort lacks any of the punch of *any* of the other 4. There are no good scares, boringly slow direction, overly dark cinematography, and pointless cameos from Sissy Spacek, Gary Cole and Elizabeth Perkins.\n\nThe Ring Two was a real disappointment, albeit a predictable one. Uninspired from the off, it didn't even look like the actors could be bothered with it, lamely delivering their lines like they were on half pay that day.\n\nAvoid."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of those movies that rides through to box-office success based on the hype generated by the previous installment. The Ring was a good movie. It was visually stunning and very unsettling. The Ring Two felt like it was trying to be as good as The Ring, but the end result is only an okay movie.\n\nFirst -- it wasn't scary. I'm not scared easily by movies, but the first scared me more than any movie ever has. I was maybe slightly on edge for about 5 minutes of this movie, total. And not even 5 consecutive minutes. The problem could be that it uses the exact same scare tactics as the first, and they're only scary the first time. The one scene that I found to be somewhat unsettling -- the \"deer scene\" for those who have seen the movie -- was stretched entirely too long, until it became slightly ridiculous and even laughable.\n\nI did not like the use of CGI in this film. Part of the beauty of the first film was that CGI was used sparingly to enhance the realism of the scene, not to act on its own as something that should scare the viewer. For me, it simply wasn't believable enough to be scary. The first one was scary because everything felt real. In a less realistic movie, such as a science fiction or fantasy film, CGI's less-than-real appearance can be overlooked since none of it looks very real to begin with, but in a film like this, realism is very important, and a little too much CGI is used for it to feel real enough.\n\nIf you're very easily scared and want a mellow horror movie, this is a \"safe\" movie for you. But if you loved the first for it's beautiful cinematography and realistic, frightening atmosphere, you'll be disappointed by this sequel."

There's a similar \"jigsaw puzzle\" element to it, but not nearly as mysterious as the first, so you just don't care as much.

I've always been a fan of the first remake, but, I don't see why I didn't just turn the thing off half way through. Everything in this movie was done horribly wrong. The thing that made the original Ring so appealing was it's use of subtle horror. Everything was constructed so well that the final product left you unsettled but satisfied. Plus, The Ring just looked downright amazing. The visual style of that film stands out as one of the best in recent American releases. The use of blues, blacks, and grays, gave the film a really washed out feeling. You didn't see a bright, solid color until the very end. See, Samara didn't really show herself until the very end of the movie when she attacked Noah. The film didn't rely on cheep scares to entertain the audience, but created a constant state of tension. I never thought of The Ring as a ghost story, but the blending of a few genres. Perhaps that's The Ring II's biggest flaw. It's a slasher film at heart.\n\nIf anyone picked up the collector's edition earlier this year with The Ring and Rings, then you already know the backstory to the sequel. I personally loved Rings, both for it's entertainment value and it's interesting visual style. Oh, just the premise alone of that short film would have created a much better sequel. Much better. The story of Aidan and Rachel was over. You didn't need to elaborate it on anymore. I'm in full support of one or two sequels to The Ring, as long as you do it right. There's a very large and interesting environment to explore. Yet, we continue to focus on Aidan and Rachel. They've just moved in to their new home, and not soon after, Rachel discovers that there's been a mysterious death in the home town.\n\n\"Oh gawd, it's something aboot his face!\" So, Rachel's got trouble. Of course, in the first ten minutes or so of the film, we have a conversation between Rachel and Samara. Ridiculous. I don't like this Samara. I don't like the Samara that goes around the world searching for people so she can have a new mommy. I like the Samara that has the ability to create a tape...and not much more. The Ring centered around the tape, not Samara. Samara's \"Decayed\" body was never scary to me. It looked good in the original, but now, it just looks like a bad costume and makeup job. Especially in the final scene when she comes out of the television. Ick. Personally, Samara was at her best when you saw the tape of her in the hospital. Creepy. The film doesn't even show the 'new' tape, and there is a new tape. It was released on the Internet a few weeks before the release. Clearly Samara had the time to create a new one, but didn't realize that DVD-Rs were the way to go for recording.\n\nThen, the film just...dies. It offers absolutely nothing, and just gets worse as it goes on. I just hate the entire concept. Samara is just out trying to kill things. But, you're not scared of Samara. You're just...uninterested. She's not interesting because the film makes her out to be the new Freddy. The film completely does away with anything that the first tried to establish. I just can't believe this film was made. Wait, yes I can. Of course it was made. The Ring did well at the box office, so a sequel should follow. It's the perfect formula! Who cares if the sequel is horrible? People will still go see it. It's sad, but it's true. This film does away with the visual style that made the original so attractive, which is sad. If they were going to make a movie with a horrible plot, at least give me something to look at.\n\nOh, and the CGI Deer. Wow. When the one came flying into the front of the car, I busted out laughing uncontrollably. There's no reason to this. None. Well, in the tape released on the Internet in promotion of the film, had a picture of a deer on the wall. So, I guess that explains it. Oh, wait. No it doesn't."

This one picks up where the original, which I loved, left off and starts with a couple of teens with the tape. It seems that tape has really gotten around since the last movie and eventually it makes its way to the small town where Watts and her creepy kid retired to. (As you remember, anyone watching the tape has to make a copy for someone else to watch or they'll get killed by Samara.) This movie was extremely slow paced and only had a few scares in it. One totally ridiculous scene had our heroes attacked by a bunch of obviously CGI deer. Real stupid and not at all scary. The deer have nothing to do with this movie except as a lame attempt at being scary. I fell asleep for 15 minutes in the middle of this flick, woke up, and realized I hadn't missed anything. A friend said it was like watching paint dry.\n\nThe plot is so stretched out that they could have easily made this a 30 minute episode of the Ring on TV and not cut anything out. The best scenes were with Lumburg from Office Space and Sissy Spacek.\n\nI loved the first Ring and just can't understand how the sequel could be such a dud."

I was so disappointed, what i can say in it's favor is that it had good special effects, that's something i can't complain, like the bathroom scene. On this film they just try to put an explanation for everything that was left as a mystery on the fist part, while mystery was what makes The Ring so good. Also the fact that they put flashes of Samara every 5 minutes, with the intention to make the movie scary, very bad attempt i most say. Probably they already knew the movie was not scary. The audience was even laughing in the theater. To me they just try to make more money, but they couldn't figure out how to make the sequel."

I didn't of course because I was too scared. The movie did turn out better than I expected though. I haven't slept in my bed alone since I saw it. I went with a lot of friends and one of them explained the things that were happening cause I kept my eyes closed about 3/4 of the time. I'm a big wimp though so yeah you should go and see it."

The movie takes a twist, deviating from the VHS storyline of part 1. It had to, but what makes it poor, is how painfully slow it is. Story 7/10 - better than VHS Story explaining more of Samara 4/10 - tries to hard to use that reflection imagery of part 1 (bunch a non sensible images that barley relate to the story except for the fact they are in a hallway or on the floor..etc..) Acting 5/10 (as expected nothing special) Overall flow and what i call Audience Chemistry Effect (ACE) 2/10\n\nJust doesn't keep the watchers interest long enough to get into it. To much like \"THEY, DARKNESS FALLS, BOOGEYMEN\" (look them up...probably the same rating)"

        "review_detailed_main": "After reading many of the comments by film critics, I was hesitant to pay to see this movie in the theaters. It was only by chance that I ended up in a theater with two and a half hours to kill, and where The Ring 2 was the only film with a soon-enough starting time that I had any interest in seeing. I went into the film expecting it to be horrible.\n\nI ended up being surprised.\n\nThe Ring 2 is a completely different movie from the first one. The first Ring film was a psychological thriller about a mysterious video tape that seemed to kill whoever saw it. Despite the fact that it left a number of key plot points unresolved - for example, how a little girl was able to transmit her thoughts into a VCR-ready tape in the first place is never explained - the first one became a huge success because the horror was from an unexpected source. How does someone who knows they only have seven days to live unless they solve a bizarre mystery is an interesting take on the survival horror genre.\n\nI only write so much about the first film because it is necessary for a proper explanation as to why people may have disliked the second film.\n\nThe Ring 2, despite any reports you may hear, is indeed a true sequel. There are a number of plot points that someone who had not seen the first one would not clearly understand. In fact, without seeing the first film, the second would probably seem so bizarre that viewers would be bound to dislike it.\n\nWhile The Ring 2 is indeed a true sequel, it is not done in the same style as the first film, and I believe that turned critics who were expecting more of the same away. The horror this time is not in beating a time limit to stave off some unforeseen consequences. As many of the reviewers have hinted, the horror this time around is in the possibility that Naomi Watts' son is somehow causing the trouble. One could say that, if anything, this would be a mother's worst fear.\n\nMost of the scares come from Watts' struggle to figure out what is going on around her, and why her son has suddenly developed a cold that lowers his body temperature. Again, very different from the first movie, but still effective.\n\nFurthermore, while this would likely enrage horror film purists, the filmmakers do add a little bit of depth to the story. Themes of domestic abuse, the connection between a child and their need for a mother, and the power of love are all explored to some degree during the course of the film.\n\nI do not pretend that The Ring 2 is better than, or even as good as, the first one. It's not. There are too many loose ends that get conveniently tied up, some of the events even after being explained still seem unclear, and there are a number of ways the ending could have been more powerful. Overall, however, The Ring 2 was an enjoyable experience. It was different from the first one, yes, but different is not always bad. If anything, it should come out on DVD soon, so at least give it a rent. You might be surprised."
