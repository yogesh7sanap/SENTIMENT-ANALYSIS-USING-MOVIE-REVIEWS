That was until I saw Pledge This. ever since then I have been unable to say worst movie ever because I know that it wasn't as bad as this one. Ill admit I thought I knew what I was getting into when I saw this movie. I knew that it was National Lampoon and how that name no longer means what it did in the 70s and 80s. I knew that it was staring Paris Hilton so that I shouldn't really expect anything majestic. But I thought that it would be a more or less fun 90 minutes if i wanted to watch a simple brainless sex comedy with lots of fart jokes. Boy was I wrong. There is nothing good about this movie. Not the story obviously or the acting. But I was almost stunned to see how bad the rest of the movie was. It was poorly edited, the quality was awful. One whole scene took place in a white room and the walls were so bright that I couldn't even see the characters. (unfortunatly I was still able to hear what was being said.) Now I'm not the type of person to normally go around bashing movies without reason. But I almost feel that I cant review this movie other than to repeat that it was bad bad bad. I planned to end this by saying that you should see it just to put every other movie you ever saw into perspective but I've decided that I couldn't even suggest you do that."

Simon Rex, although he is hot, nothing can save him from his abysmal performance in this train wreck.. he should stick to porn.\n\nThe director should be ashamed to have put his name on something so ridiculous and tacky.. Somehow I don't think an Oscar is on the cards for this guy.\n\nI have never written a comment on IMDb, but this movie was so bad I felt compelled to do so.\n\nIf you get the chance to see this film, don't."

This movie made me stupid.\n\nThe acting is terrible, and Paris Hilton's voice-over is annoying at best, and sometimes ambiguous about whose voice-over it actually is. There is barely any continuity between scenes, and major plot points are often introduced but then mysteriously forgotten forever by the next scene. Gags and jokes are lame; every part of the movie seems to be designed specifically to insult your intelligence as a viewer. Worse, the entire movie is based around the idea of the sorority being \"hot\", but there wasn't a single part about it that I found hot. Truly, I don't think there's anything in this movie that anyone but a hotel heiress can relate to.\n\nIn short, if you think Paris Hilton is beautiful and amazing, then you will love this movie!"

No-one who isn't past puberty can find this funny, I watched this with 3 of my friends. We all like high school movies (we all go to college), especially when we are hung over from last night which we were when we watched this \"movie\".\n\nFirst we wanted to shut it off and go watch paint dry, but then some randomly placed (very nice) T&A came in to the picture and we decided to continue watching. We didn't understand anything about the plot and if you do, you have probably written the manuscript. There is no logic at all in this movie.\n\nThis is what I believe that the movie is about: Paris Hilton is the head of some girl sorority, her biggest dream is to be on the cover of FHM (soft-playboy) and now she has her chance. FHM have a competition where the most beautiful sorority gets to be on the cover, awesome! But (oh no) the sorority has to have a nerd girl too so now they have to let in a group of nerd-girls in the sorority.\n\nActually the only thing that kept us watching was that every time one of us started to complain about how bad this movie was one of the girls in movie showed her titties. Kudos to the director who actually saw when the movie sucked so bad that titties was the only thing that could save the movie. There are a LOT of randomly placed tittie-scenes which have nothing to do with the \"plot\" in this movie. And they're needed.\n\nThis movie has no logic, actually not even scenes that fit together, it is for no one that isn't IN puberty, the few laughs you'll get is when the movie makes so little sense that it's actually funny. The girls in this movie are very nice tough, but they don't manage to make it watchable.\n\nUnless if you really-really like tits, then maybe this movie can make you not vomit. If you do like tits (I know I do) rent American Pie 5 instead, it's funnier. Or rent porn, it has better acting."

I did not see this film as Paris Hilton was in it in fact I saw it despite the fact her name was on the cover,in fact I thought her name was only on the cover for name value as no-one would be stupid enough to put her in a lead role, but yes they did! I cannot stress this strongly enough...DO NOT SEE THIS FILM!"

There is nothing there - no real script, no good casting, no good music, and finally there is Paris Hilton, an epitome of a bad taste. Man, she doesn't even pretend to play. All she can do, is a set of learned-before poses and smiles, wry and false, as she always was. This is not good, in addition to the \"pleasure\" of watching her legs and body too too much, which is not the most yummy part, either. I cannot even imagine anyone, except for sex-hungry, 12-years boy, or a little, brainless girl of 10, who could watch this abominable terror.

        "review_detailed_main": "Some films get a score of 1 because they are ineptly filmed or the acting is terrible due to incredibly low budgets. Given what they had, they couldn't do much better.. This film, technically speaking, isn't that bad--it looks professional. But, it is also the ugliest and most shallow film I have ever seen without a single thing to recommend it.\n\nThe film stars Paris Hilton and she also narrates much of the film. The premise is that she's the ultimate hottie and she goes to South Beach to help a sorority become hot enough to win some pointless award. And much of the narration consists of her finding fault with everyone and it abounds with her put-downs, as no one could possibly be \"as hot and sexy\" as her. She forgot to also add \"as narcissistic and pathetic\".\n\nHere are a few of the highlights in this uplifting and sublime film: a bathroom where the toilets and sinks become geysers of liquefied human waste and it spews on everyone, an Indian lady who learns about the joys of a vibrator, a lady showing off her horribly scarred breasts following breast surgery, stereotypes as opposed to realistic characters (such as the obligatory fat girl with a suitcase stuffed with snacks and the religious zealot), some anti-lesbian and anti-woman remarks/jokes (I'm not super-sensitive about politically correct stuff and still it clearly offended me to hear women referred to that way), bestiality as well as the crudest language I've ever heard (not funny crude, just classless and crass). Clearly, the film shows all the imagination and grace of a movie written by a 13 year-old--a very nasty and talentless 13 year-old. Currently, this and several other Paris Hilton films are in the hallowed Bottom 100 on IMDb. Considering it consists of Hilton dispensing advice to others on how to be a better person or just her torturing people for fun, I could certainly understand it making the list! It's nasty and cruel--without a hint of grace or cleverness. If you think that Paris does not get enough time in front of the camera and you have absolutely no values (other than to look 'hot'), then this movie is for you. Otherwise, find something else to do...ANYTHING else!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Pledge This! is a new film from National Lampoon, and this installment follows along the lines of the other films--a simple plot, good actors, a paper-thin love story, plenty of sight gags, and some sort of villain. This film, however, takes the equation one step further with its quirky characters. The film stars Paris Hilton (House of Wax, The Hillz), Simon Rex (Scary Movie 3, Shriek if You Know What I Did Last Friday the 13th), Sarah Carter (Final Destination 2), Paula Garces (Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, Clockstoppers), Geoffrey Arend (The Ringer, Bubble Boy) and many other young, up-and-coming actors and actresses.\n\nVictoria English (Paris Hilton) is the wealthy, snobbish president of Gamma Gamma sorority at South Beach University in Miami, Florida. When Victoria learns that FHM Magazine is nominating them for \"Best Sorority of the Year\", Victoria plots to have more \"diversified\" co-eds pledge her sorority to integrate her all-blonde and wealthy sorority. One of Victoria's pledges, Kristen Haas (Sarah Carter), suggests they pledge her ex-friend Gloria (Paula Garces) and six of her misfit dorm mates; DJ spinner Monique; an Indian exchange student nicknamed PooPoo; divorc\u00e9e Kathy, who is seeking to relive her youth by going back to college; fat Southern belle Maxine; weird goth girl Babs; and lesbian chick Tonya. The seven pledges are force to go through the most outrageous initiations to be accepted. But when they learn that it was all an act just to get the front cover of FHM magazine, Gloria teams up with Victoria's boyfriend, Derek (Simon Rex), to settle the score.\n\nSurprisingly, the acting in Pledge This! is quite solid, but the script is pretty lacking. It just does overused clich\u00e9s one after another until we hit the extremely obvious ending. However, the clich\u00e9s are actually most of what makes this movie work. If this tried to be some original romantic comedy, I couldn't see it working on any level whatsoever. I wasn't expecting much from Paris Hilton, as I had seen her in House of Wax and her acting was so wooden and boring that, basically, I wanted to throw up. However, Paris Hilton somehow manages to surprise\u0085 and this is supposed to be direct-to-video fare! I've never really thought that Paris Hilton was very attractive, but in Pledge This!, the lighting, outfits, and hair style that Paris is given really make her stand out. Simon Rex was great as usual--he has rapidly become one of my favorite actors through the very few films that I have seen him in. His acting style is always hysterically funny, and the movie was worth watching just to see what sort of wacky performance he would appear in next. Paula Garces is perfect as Gloria, and the love story between she and Derek was believable, although, again, quite clich\u00e9d. All of the other characters were very creative and fun.\n\nIn terms of sight gags and nudity, they're in plentiful supply here. One of my favorite scenes had a dog giving Simon Rex a blow job! Classic! There was a lot of female nudity, and while I'm not one to complain, some scenes just felt thrown in there for the sake of nudity alone. I really liked the story; something new filled with old stuff.\n\nOverall, Pledge This! is a fun movie for what it was--a direct-to-video National Lampoon film that does very little to break from the mold. See this for nudity and laughs, but don't expect a masterpiece."

We're talking about the same people that brought us Van Wilder, Animal House and the Vacation series!!! With that said, after the movie was over, I asked myself, \"And why was the name National Lampoon's\" on this???? I have to admit that I didn't care too much for the Dorm Days series, either, and was even whispering then.......What happened to National Lampoon's??? Anyway, I have seen quite a few Paris Hilton films and enjoyed them all, and to be honest, I didn't think she did a bad job here guys. I've seen her do worse, like her performance in Bottom's Up with Jason Mewes. It almost appeared as if she didn't really want to do that movie, as she was not making an effort to making her character believable. As for the rest of Pledge This? The movie was filled with extremely lame punchlines and a predictable outcome. I watched the Special Features, and one of the actors, I believe it was, actually called it a great script! You could have put, I don't know, Ryan Reynolds and Tara Reid in this movie and it still wouldn't have been a great script! I will give it 3 stars because even though it was predictable, I thought with funnier punchlines, it actually could have been a hilarious movie. All in all, I think Paris has the potential to be a good actress if she'd stop accepting roles that are based on, well....her! Oh, and WHAT HAPPENED TO NATIONAL LAMPOON'S????"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a real story. This morning I finished my night ship at work, got into the car and drove home. On my way I got a message from one of my coworkers, who seemed really stressed and wanted me to get back to him as soon as possible.\n\nA few minutes later I got home, and called him back after parking. He said that there's a woman there who claims I trashed one of her car doors while leaving the parking lot. That was strange to me, since I didn't hit anything and my car was perfectly clean and whole.\n\nLater today I realized that the woman was trying to get other people to pay her for a new door, by parking next to them and then blaming them for hitting her car, while it was actually hit from before. I called my agency and it took them a while to calm me down. Eventually I did, but my day was ruined.\n\nAnd then, this evening, I saw Pledge This!, and realized my day wasn't entirely lost until that point, which made it the worst day in my life.\n\n(A stupid girl): \"Whoa, that dress must have cost hundreds of dollars!\" (Another stupid girl): \"You mean thousands.\" (A stupid girl): \"Thousands of dollars?\" (Another stupid girl): \"Hundreds of thousands.\" (A stupid girl): \"Thousands of thousands. That's what I meant!\"\n\nThis dialog is a perfect example of how shallow, abominable, idiotic, execrable, and completely abysmal this movie is. The plot is based on a first grader's limerick, the acting is based on porno, and you know what - Paris Hilton is really not that hot. Most of the other girls looked way better than that silicone plastic Barbie, although they all portrayed a similar lack of intelligence and acting abilities.\n\nI saw \"Cursed\" once and believed it was the worst movie ever, but this movie is not even on the scale. It is a waste of money in the most horrible and angering form you can imagine. And I don't mean YOUR money, I mean the producers' money, who are probably going to slam their heads against random walls to the beat of \"What the heck was I thinking\" for the rest of their lives.\n\nIf your local video store has this movie in stock, discontinue your membership at once."

If you are someone who demands a bit more from a movie beyond canine oral sex and \"it's all about me\" portrayals, then this movie is not for you. Beginning with the title, \"Pledge This,\" the obvious reference is to male-oriented aphorisms related to the male organ. That should be the first clue. The opening credit sequence shows Paris Hilton bouncing superimposed through various venues and male and female alike agog at her presence. Later, in one of the opening scenes, several Paris look-alikes are wanting to join her sorority. Finding some of them unfit to her plastic standards, two of them have bags placed over their heads. It was the dog performing oral sex in Paris' stead that convinced me it was not worth the additional time. The movie is several steps below sophomoric."

There are some funny scenes where they show the different sororities the \"losers\" see. Also some inappropriate scenes, as I would say. This movie would've been absolutely perfect for teen girls - a classic sleepover movie. However, the inappropriate scenes that don't really have a impact on the movie, build up the R rating.

I don't even know who bought the DVD and if I did they would be in trouble for wasting money, we could have gotten a large pizza or something.\n\nI absolutely abhor this movie: terrible acting, terrible story line, terrible script, and the movie seemed to serve no purpose. It is absent of any intelligent or intellectual thought and I don;t know how the producer got anyone to act in it, they should be ashamed. The only time Paris Hilton should be on camera is when she isn't saying anything.\n\nThis film is a disgrace to American Film. Please do not watch it, even if your life depends on it, however...it is a bit fun to make fun of the magnificently terrible acting."

Now I still haven't really come over it. I still jump up in he air like a mad grasshopper whenever I see the color pink again.\n\nJoke aside, although this movie really scared me. I thought nothing could be more horrible than Birdemic and its sequel, but I think we have a winner. Birdemic was bad, and had almost no budget at all, but was still in some way entertaining. Pledge This! had a budget, but was so extremely boring and overexposed and sexist that me and my friend were close to turn the film off and stop watching a several times. But we didn't. We pushed ourselves. We pushed ourselves to watch it to the end. The struggle was real.\n\nThis movie was probably only made to expose Paris Hilton's ego, with her in both the leading role and as executive producer. The entire film seem to be about her beauty and flawlessness, but also how good she is in bed, and how much everyone admires her (according to herself).\n\nI am still not sure of the storyline of this movie. The description says girls that are about to enter a special house at a university or so something where Paris Hilton is the god or queen or big leader or whatever it was. I'd say it didn't really have one. The film was all so messy and the acting so horrible that the story probably drowned in it.\n\nParis Hilton's parents must be proud."

She never had to work hard one day in her entire spoiled life except for random photo shoots for a few magazines here and there and to appear in a couple of movie flops. And Paris has no real acting training whatsoever and you can tell that spoiled so and so doesn't even try for her movie scenes and that the directors are just totally fine with that. They probably hardly ever even yelled \"cut\" cause they were so OK with lousiness. Yes, tough life Paris has had. Hollywood used to have work incredibly hard to film their great films. Judy Garland worked very hard for about 14 hours a day and slept about 4 hours a night, had brilliant amazing passion and singing voice, and she touched our hearts. Judy may've been a drug addict but it was not her fault, the studios made her take addictive stimulants to give her the energy she needed for those long hours. Today, the celebrity drug addicts like Lindsey Lohan and Brittany Spears got into addictions becsuse they chose 100% on their own to take them because they wanted to be wild and party. And today we have \"Pledge this\" and horrible flops like \"disaster movie\", \"epic movie\", etc. Oh, how Hollywood has fallen. And America's way, and, well society in general. Little by little since the 1940s and 1950s, to where the change we have now since then is so enormous words cannot describe it. Celebrities once actually really worked for their fortune. They really worked. \"Pledge this \" is nothing but a.very dumb no brainer about a sorority who wants to win best looking sorority over other sororities. And she wants to diss anyone entering her sorority whose not as perfect as she is. Seriously, that's about it in this movie. That and soooo much dumb, annoying, brainless acting, if you even want to call it that. Terrible, embarrassingly bad movie. Movie, if you even want to call it that."

Paris Hilton delivers the greatest performance of her career (yes even better than her jaw dropping acting in House of Wax or the recent film The Hottie and the Nottie). Not only is this Paris best performance ever, but it also rivals the greatest acting performances in the history of this industry. No other actor this decade has come close to the mark Paris Hilton set in this film and I highly doubt anyone else will. Now enough about Paris, on to the film.\n\nThis is a film where acting isn't all that is going for it. Along with Paris Hilton's fabulous exertion of the acting art, there is also an excellent script and on top of that an out of this world director. Lets focus on the script. This is truly a script that will make you laugh, cry and come back for more. The script is so fantastic that the second and third tier characters have the most beautiful lines, that they deliver with absolute care for the art form that only this talented cast could show. The quality of the lines is apparent as well. This movie is not without its fair share of repeatable quotes, which are both clever and deep intellectually. The script is one for the ages.\n\nThe directing of this film is superb as well. Both directors William Heins (also an excellent actor in the film) and Strathford Hamilton (known for his excellent work with The Pact) put their hearts and souls into the crafting of this magnificent film. The choices for the camera shots were nothing short of amazing. It seems as if it spoon feeds you an amazing tale, but is full of deeper meaning, like why am I being spoon fed, just to give an example that corresponds with my original metaphor. They directors make this film work on so many levels. It is a master piece for the unwashed masses but also challenges the greatest minds with deep meaning.\n\nOverall Pledge This! is the best film of 06 hands down no questions asked."

She's also failed at all of those because her movies, singing and spinning are all terrible.\n\nFrom what I can remember this is a story of a group of girls pledging to a sorority.

They're humiliated, made to be the butt of all sorts of jokes and nasty pranks and something something they manage to overcome these obstacles and become better people in the end.\n\nAnd yes, it would have been just as bad if Paris had not been in it.

So I checked out the bottom 100 and I was curious how bad a movie could be. Since Paris Hilton stars at least 4 of the 100, this movie seamed to be a good choice. And it was. I managed to get though the whole 90 minutes, but not without pauses to reanimate my brain.\n\nSo what is the problem with this movie?\n\nStory: It is sort of a simplified \"Revenge of the Nerds\" storyline, if that movie was to complicated, check this one\n\nActing: Paris Hilton is \"playing\" a bimbo with very rich parents, interested only in fashion and style. Amazing how she does that. To be in a sorority, I would say you need to go to college as well, and actually we see 2 scenes in a classroom. One class on fashion, in which a teacher is explaining something about Dolce & Gabanna, the other is on Kama Sutra. College according to Paris.\n\nTargeted audience: Jokes are maybe funny to <12 year olds It has a strong sexual content, both verbally as well as visually. In many countries you'd have to be 18 to see it You would think it is a movie for girls, since it is all pink and fairytale like situated, but that does not match the shots of nude girls and lesbian insinuations.\n\nSo what do I think about this movie? It is probably funny if you are a 12 year old boy, and manage to get a hold on it and secretly watch it with your first girlfriend. For every other sane human being, abstain from this thing, or you might suffer irreversible brain damage.\n\nFor me it is a new baseline for my movie scale, I will need to rate some other movies that I rated 1 before up, because they were way better than this. Hopefully in a few weeks I will be able to do simple maths again.\n\nA well deserved 1/10"

For the life of me I can't understand how this did not get shelved after seeing the final product.\n\nSomeone actually watched this and thought it worthy of movie material releasable to the public, that person should be fired and never allowed to even see a film again.\n\nSomething tells me that Paris wasn't acting, that this character is pretty close to the way she is in real life.\n\nI enjoy bad movies, but not this bad. This is something a 13 year old kid with a hormone issue would write.\n\nParis needs to stick to looking at her average face in a mirror and stay away from the screen."

Paris Hilton is really pretty and she is president of a sorority which is perfect for her because she always seems like she's in charge of all the fun stuff. I don't want to ruin all the jokes for everyone but there are plenty of them, especially the one with Paris's boyfriend and her dog. I just almost died. lol There's a guy in there that played a Nerd and he was kinda cute, heck all of the boys were pretty cute and so were the girls. The scenes at the pool made me want to be there because everyone looked so good in their swimsuits. South Beach looks really pretty and I'm going to go visit it sometime. I think I'm going to see the movie again tomorrow it was so much fun."

What's so bad about it? Where to begin-the ridiculous attempts at comedy, the absolutely evil mean bitches in this POS, the completely hateful protagonists...I don't think this is a spoiler by saying Paris Hilton is a HORRIBLE actress and an even worse narrator. The men in this movie are pathetic and contemptible. One longs for Freddy Krueger to come crashing through the sets and start cleaning house--like some avenging angel of justice, setting the scales straight in the direction of real life. The writers have the lion's share of blame for this atrocity. The Paris character should have been held up for the ridicule that she is held in by the rest of the world. Where are the drug jokes? Where are the porn flick jokes? Why didn't they write in a scene where drugs fell out of her purse and she claims they aren't hers? But we all know the writers are just the pawns of the producers and unable to accurately portray the Paris we all know and hate. Well, EFF YOU, Paris. You are a carbuncle on the anus of the world."

Once you've watched it, come back here and read some of the 'loved it' reviews.. you'll laugh your butt off. (obviously, many were written by the studio.. how could anyone say Paris does a great performance in this?!) Won't kids who have Paris as a role model end up watching this gratuitous T&A film? Won't somebody please think of the children? Paris looks disgusting, her lighting and makeup is poor and she doesn't do well to look young or sexy. She is putrid. Her performance is terrible, she can't deliver lines or never rehearsed (her dull performance in 'One Night In Paris' was better).\n\nThere is a huge amount of failure in this film. It really is painful to watch. Please, Paris-cetamol for my headache anyone?"

This movie was so unsaveable, even a boatload full of topless college girls couldn't make me ignore my sudden urge to drown in my own blood. I was forced to give this movie a 1/10, while it deserves a hell of a lot less.\n\nFirstly, Paris Hilton. She is, without a doubt, the worst actor ever to get paid to act. It is absolutely disgusting that someone with as little talent as this can make anything out of their lives. She is also the most ugly 'hot' girl i have ever seen. If i had a choice between getting with her and that fat chick, the fatty wins hands down Secondly, plot. This was even worse than Beta House (great movie). Bucket of S***, gtfo.\n\nThirdly, in most movies, the audience is supposed to become attached to at least one character. i found myself wishing they had all never existed. The funniest moment of this whole movie was realizing that it was meant to be a comedy.\n\nFourthly. As i have come to expect from dumb idiots (Paris) worldwide, there is so much error in the film it is unbelievable. Firstly, you stupid motherf****r. GAMMA IS NOT A G. AT BEST IT IS A Y. Unforgivable, RETARTED ERROR. SELF EXTERMINATE NOW The s***tiness of this movie enrages me, and i will now go and half-drown myself to try and forget about it. Good day."

It was completely idiotic. If you thought some of the Hollywood spoofs were bad, this one takes the cake in completely sucking. Never before has a movie been so completely horrible that i've actually bothered to leave a review saying how completely shite it was - in other words, don't even bother watching it.

And they nod stupidly, awestruck by this amazing beauty. This scene seems to set the stage and things only go downhill from there.\n\nThe plot is ridiculous and the acting is awful. On the plus side, the video were vibrant and full of color, the shots were in focus, and there wasn't any noticeable camera shake. So the camera men certainly earned their keep, pity the rest of the crew didn't."

Victoria English (Hilton) is the sorority president of \"GAMMA GAMMA\" who lets the \"campus geeks\" (which most of them really don't look that geeky) pledge her sorority because it adds \"Diversity\" to her group and will get her on the cover of FH magazine as soon as her sorority is chosen she publicly humiliates the pledges and gets rid of them. The rest of the movie is about the geeks getting Victoria back. Ms.Hilton's best performance was still in Repo!, but this is a good time passer with a few good laughs. Not as bad as \"Bottom's Up\" that was complete trash."

Even by normal teen pandering schlock, this movie is filled with incredibly coarse sex jokes, that you would be wondering whether it's an adult movie or not. I prefer not to view this movie, but it still left me with a message, \"Money can make you pampered and self indulgent like Paris.\" If money makes me like that, I would move out of my house, give my money to the bank, and stay homeless for the rest of my life! Paris was so grossed out by the final result, and she decided to boycott her own premiere due to nude scenes. I think she made sense. Pledge This is just vapid self- indulgent celebrity white noise."
